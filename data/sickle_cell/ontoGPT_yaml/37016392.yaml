input_text: 'Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine or sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine for the
  chemoprevention of malaria in children with sickle cell anaemia in eastern and southern
  Africa (CHEMCHA): a protocol for a multi-centre, two-arm, double-blind, randomised,
  placebo-controlled superiority trial. BACKGROUND: An estimated 300,000 babies are
  born with sickle cell anaemia (SCA) annually. Affected children have chronic ill
  health and suffer premature death. Febrile illnesses such as malaria commonly precipitate
  acute crises in children with SCA. Thus, chemoprophylaxis for malaria is an important
  preventive strategy, but current regimes are either sub-optimally effective (e.g.
  monthly sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine, SP) or difficult to adhere to (e.g. daily proguanil).
  We propose dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) as the agent with the most potential
  to be used across Africa. METHODS: This will be a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group
  superiority trial of weekly single-day courses of DP compared to monthly single-day
  courses of SP in children with SCA. The study will be conducted in eastern (Uganda)
  and southern (Malawi) Africa using randomisation stratified by body weight and study
  centre. Participants will be randomised using an allocation of 1:1 to DP or SP.
  We will investigate the efficacy, safety, acceptability and uptake and cost-effectiveness
  of malaria chemoprevention with weekly courses of DP vs monthly SP in 548 to 824
  children with SCA followed up for 12-18 months. We will also assess toxicity from
  cumulative DP dosing and the development of resistance. Participant recruitment
  commenced on 30 April 2021; follow-up is ongoing. DISCUSSION: At the end of this
  study, findings will be used to inform regional health policy. This manuscript is
  prepared from protocol version 2.1 dated 1 January 2022. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The
  trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04844099 . Registered on 08 April
  2021.'
