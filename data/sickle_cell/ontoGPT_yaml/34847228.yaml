input_text: 'Deferiprone vs deferoxamine for transfusional iron overload in SCD and
  other anemias: a randomized, open-label noninferiority study. Many people with sickle
  cell disease (SCD) or other anemias require chronic blood transfusions, which often
  causes iron overload that requires chelation therapy. The iron chelator deferiprone
  is frequently used in individuals with thalassemia syndromes, but data in patients
  with SCD are limited. This open-label study assessed the efficacy and safety of
  deferiprone in patients with SCD or other anemias receiving chronic transfusion
  therapy. A total of 228 patients (mean age: 16.9 [range, 3-59] years; 46.9% female)
  were randomized to receive either oral deferiprone (n = 152) or subcutaneous deferoxamine
  (n = 76). The primary endpoint was change from baseline at 12 months in liver iron
  concentration (LIC), assessed by R2* magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The least
  squares mean (standard error) change in LIC was -4.04 (0.48) mg/g dry weight for
  deferiprone vs -4.45 (0.57) mg/g dry weight for deferoxamine, with noninferiority
  of deferiprone to deferoxamine demonstrated by analysis of covariance (least squares
  mean difference 0.40 [0.56]; 96.01% confidence interval, -0.76 to 1.57). Noninferiority
  of deferiprone was also shown for both cardiac T2* MRI and serum ferritin. Rates
  of overall adverse events (AEs), treatment-related AEs, serious AEs, and AEs leading
  to withdrawal did not differ significantly between the groups. AEs related to deferiprone
  treatment included abdominal pain (17.1% of patients), vomiting (14.5%), pyrexia
  (9.2%), increased alanine transferase (9.2%) and aspartate transferase levels (9.2%),
  neutropenia (2.6%), and agranulocytosis (0.7%). The efficacy and safety profiles
  of deferiprone were acceptable and consistent with those seen in patients with transfusion-dependent
  thalassemia. This trial study was registered at www://clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT02041299.'
