input_text: 'Standardizing Opioid Prescribing in a Pediatric Hospital: A Quality Improvement
  Effort. BACKGROUND: Opioids are indicated for moderate-to-severe pain caused by
  trauma, ischemia, surgery, cancer and sickle cell disease, and vaso-occlusive episodes
  (SCD-VOC). There is only limited evidence regarding the appropriate number of doses
  to prescribe for specific indications. Therefore, we developed and implemented an
  opioid prescribing algorithm with dosing guidelines for specific procedures and
  conditions. We aimed to reach and sustain 90% compliance within 1 year of implementation.
  METHODS: We conducted this quality improvement effort at a pediatric academic quaternary
  care institution. In 2018, a multidisciplinary team identified the need for a standard
  approach to opioid prescribing. The algorithm guides prescribers to evaluate the
  medical history, physical examination, red flags, pain type, and to initiate opioid-sparing
  interventions before prescribing opioids. Opioid prescriptions written between January
  2015 and September 2020 were included. Examples from 2 hospital departments will
  be highlighted. Control charts for compliance with guidelines and variability in
  the doses prescribed are presented for selected procedures and conditions. RESULTS:
  Over 5 years, 83 037 opioid prescriptions in 53 804 unique patients were entered
  electronically. The encounters with >=1 opioid prescription decreased from 48% to
  25% between 2015 and 2019. Compliance with the specific guidelines increased to
  ~85% for periacetabular osteotomies and SCD-VOC and close to 100% for anterior-cruciate
  ligament surgery. In all 3 procedures and conditions, variability in the number
  of doses prescribed decreased significantly. CONCLUSION: We developed an algorithm,
  guidelines, and a process for improvement. The number of opioid prescriptions and
  variability in opioid prescribing decreased. Future evaluation of specific initiatives
  within departments is needed.'
