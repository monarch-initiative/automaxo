input_text: 'ATYPICAL FOVEAL AND PARFOVEAL ABNORMALITIES IN SICKLE CELL DISEASE.PURPOSE:
  The primary aim was to describe patterns of para macular involvement, not yet reported
  but that OCT-A can now detect in SCD patients. The secondary aim was to search arguments
  concerning the physio pathogeny of para macular involvement. METHODS: This institutional
  cohort retrospective study was conducted in a Referral Center for Ophthalmological
  Rare Diseases. Follow-up included an ophthalmological examination with optical coherent
  tomography and optical coherent tomography angiography. RESULTS: Hundred and thirty-two
  sickle cell patients were included. Typical sickle cell maculopathy was observed
  in temporal area in 84 eyes (40.0 %) of SS patients and 8 eyes (14.8 %) of SC patients
  (p < 0.001). Enlargement of the foveal avascular zone was observed in 10 eyes whom
  8 of SS patients. Two atypical parafoveal abnormalities were found in SS patients
  only. The first one consisted in macular thinning with normal vascularization in
  15 eyes of 11 patients. The second atypical maculopathy was large areas of loss
  of vascularization without retina thinning 10 eyes of six patients. Multivariate
  analysis did not show a statistically significant relation between the PSR stage
  and the different type of sickle cell maculopathy (p = 0.21). CONCLUSION: Those
  atypical sickle cell maculopathy may correspond to early forms preceding a typical
  SCM. This would point towards several physiopathogenic mechanisms. The first one
  included the existence of ischemia which can be related to anemia. Presence of retinal
  thinning without vascular involvement point out to a neurogenic mechanism.'
