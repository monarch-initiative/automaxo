input_text: '[Acute splenic sequestration in children with sickle cell disease--an
  overview]. Acute splenic sequestration in children with sickle cell disease - an
  overview Acute splenic sequestration (ASS) is a life-threatening complication of
  sickle cell disease (SCD). The condition is important to recognize due to the fact
  that it can occur with previously unknown disease. ASS is one of the most common
  causes of death in children with SCD and is the result of blood suddenly getting
  congested in the spleen, resulting in splenomegaly, acute anemia, and hypovolemic
  shock. Timely and appropriate treatment is essential in preventing death. Episodes
  of ASS before one year of age are associated with a higher risk of recurrence. There
  is no established effective treatment for recurrent ASS; however, there is evidence
  that all children with SCD should be treated with hydroxyurea. In Sweden, our recommendation
  is to evaluate the indications for splenectomy after the first episode of ASS. Allogeneic
  hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative treatment, and
  all children with SCD should be evaluated with regard to the potential success of
  HSCT. This article presents an overview of the condition with Swedish recommendations.'
