input_text: Absence of hydroxyurea-induced mutational effects supports higher utilisation
  for the treatment of sickle cell anaemia. Hydroxyurea (hydroxycarbamide) is approved
  for treating both children and adults with sickle cell anaemia (SCA). Fetal haemoglobin
  (HbF) induction is the primary treatment response, along with improved anaemia,
  reduced haemolysis, myelosuppression and decreased endothelial inflammation. Hydroxyurea
  has proven clinical efficacy for SCA - treatment significantly reduces disease manifestations
  and prolongs survival. Despite these recognised benefits, long-standing concerns
  regarding the risks of mutagenic and potentially carcinogenic drug exposure have
  hampered efforts for broad hydroxyurea use in SCA, although these are based largely
  on outdated experimental models and treatment experiences with myeloproliferative
  neoplasms. Consequently, many patients with SCA are not receiving this highly effective
  disease-modifying therapy. In this review, we describe the concept of genotoxicity
  and its laboratory measurements, summarise hydroxyurea-associated data from both
  preclinical and clinical studies, and discuss carcinogenic potential. The genotoxicity
  results clearly demonstrate that hydroxyurea does not directly bind DNA and is not
  mutagenic. Rather, its genotoxic effects are limited to indirect clastogenicity
  occurring in select cell types, and only when high dose and time thresholds are
  exceeded. This absence of mutagenic activity is consistent with the observed lack
  of any compelling carcinogenic potential. Since hydroxyurea therapy for SCA carries
  minimal carcinogenic risks, the current drug labelling should be modified accordingly,
  and prescribing practices should be broadened to allow better access and increased
  utilisation of this highly effective drug.
