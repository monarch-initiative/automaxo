input_text: "Hospital Readmissions from Patients' Perspectives. OBJECTIVES: Healthcare
  expenditures in the United States have increased exponentially and hospital care
  accounts for one-third of these costs. Approximately 18% of hospitalized Medicare
  beneficiaries are being readmitted to the hospital within 30 days. Engaging patients
  in the discharge process can help better identify patients' postdischarge needs
  and implement more effective readmission prevention strategies. The objective of
  our study was to identify the factors that contribute to hospital readmission as
  seen from patients' perspectives in a large urban community hospital. METHODS: We
  evaluated all consecutive, unplanned readmissions to the hospitalist service within
  30 days of discharge, using the STate Action on Avoidable Rehospitalizations diagnostic
  worksheet with face-to-face patient interviews and retrospective chart reviews.
  RESULTS: During the study period, 80 patients were readmitted within 30 days of
  their discharge, with 28 of them having more than one readmission. The mean age
  was 50.8 +- 18.3 years. Of the 80 patients, 51% were men and 51% were black. Sickle
  cell disease was the leading diagnosis (11.3%) in both index admissions and readmissions.
  Patient interviews identified some modifiable risk factors for readmissions such
  as the inability to obtain medications or schedule follow-up appointments as well
  as problems related to transportation, housing, and social support. Despite clear
  discharge planning and patient understanding of the plan being recorded at discharge,
  almost one-third of patients appeared to lack the ability to self-manage symptoms
  and understand the disease process. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that engaging
  patients in discharge planning can help identify barriers within the process. Improvements
  in socioeconomic/environmental layers of population health have the potential to
  prevent hospitalizations and readmissions in the long term."
