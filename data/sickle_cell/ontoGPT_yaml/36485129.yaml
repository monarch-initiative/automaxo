input_text: Knowledge to date on secondary malignancy following hematopoietic cell
  transplantation for sickle cell disease. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation,
  gene therapy, and gene editing offer a potential cure for sickle cell disease (SCD).
  Unfortunately, myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia development have
  been higher than expected after graft rejection following nonmyeloablative conditioning
  and lentivirus-based gene therapy employing myeloablative busulfan for SCD. Somatic
  mutations discovered in 2 of 76 patients who rejected their grafts were identified
  at baseline at much lower levels. While a whole-genome sequencing analysis reported
  no difference between patients with SCD and controls, a study including whole-exome
  sequencing revealed a higher prevalence of clonal hematopoiesis in individuals with
  SCD compared with controls. Genetic risk factors for myeloid malignancy development
  after curative therapy for SCD are currently being explored. Once discovered, decisions
  could be made about whether gene therapy may be feasible vs allogeneic hematopoietic
  cell transplant, which results in full donor chimerism. In the meantime, care should
  be taken to perform a benefit/risk assessment to help patients identify the best
  curative approach for them. Long-term follow-up is necessary to monitor for myeloid
  malignancies and other adverse effects of curative therapies for SCD.
