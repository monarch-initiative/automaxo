input_text: Inflammatory Dendritic Cells Contribute to Regulate the Immune Response
  in Sickle Cell Disease.Sickle cell disease (SCD), one of the most common hemoglobinopathies
  worldwide, is characterized by a chronic inflammatory component, with systemic release
  of inflammatory cytokines, due to hemolysis and vaso-occlusive processes. Patients
  with SCD demonstrate dysfunctional T and B lymphocyte responses, and they are more
  susceptible to infection. Although dendritic cells (DCs) are the main component
  responsible for activating and polarizing lymphocytic function, and are able to
  produce pro-inflammatory cytokines found in the serum of patients with SCD, minimal
  studies have thus far been devoted to these cells. In the present study, we identified
  the subpopulations of circulating DCs in patients with SCD, and found that the bloodstream
  of the patients showed higher numbers and percentages of DCs than that of healthy
  individuals. Among all the main DCs subsets, inflammatory DCs (CD14+ DCs) were responsible
  for this rise and correlated with higher reticulocyte count. The patients had more
  activated monocyte-derived DCs (mo-DCs), which produced MCP-1, IL-6, and IL-8 in
  culture. We found that a CD14+ mo-DC subset present in culture from some of the
  patients was the more activated subset and was mainly responsible for cytokine production,
  and this subset was also responsible for IL-17 production in co-culture with T lymphocytes.
  Finally, we suggest an involvement of heme oxygenase in the upregulation of CD14
  in mo-DCs from the patients, indicating a potential mechanism for inducing inflammatory
  DC differentiation from circulating monocytes in the patients, which correlated
  with inflammatory cytokine production, T lymphocyte response skewing, and reticulocyte
  count.
