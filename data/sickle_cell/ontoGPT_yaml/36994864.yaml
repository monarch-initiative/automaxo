input_text: 'Efficacy of non-pharmacological interventions to reduce pain in children
  with sickle cell disease: A systematic review.BACKGROUND: Pain is the clinical hallmark
  of sickle cell disease (SCD) leading to hospitalization, psychological sequelae
  and a decreased health-related quality of life. The aim of this systematic literature
  review is to evaluate the efficacy of non-pharmacological interventions in reducing
  sickle cell related pain in children with SCD. METHODS: Following the Preferred
  Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines, a comprehensive
  literature search up until October 2022 was performed to identify studies that investigated
  the efficacy of non-pharmacological interventions on (1) pain frequency and/or intensity,
  and (2) analgesic and health service use in children with SCD until the age of 21.
  Both randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-experimental designed (QED) studies
  were considered for inclusion. RESULTS: Ten articles (five RCTs and five QED studies)
  with 422 participants were included. They investigated cognitive behavioural therapy
  (CBT) (n = 5), biofeedback (n = 2), massage (n = 1), virtual reality (n = 1) and
  yoga (n = 1). The majority of the interventions were psychological (n = 7) and were
  performed in the outpatient clinic (n = 6). CBT and biofeedback significantly reduced
  frequency and/or intensity of SCD-related pain in outpatient settings, while virtual
  reality and yoga significantly reduced pain in inpatient settings. Biofeedback also
  significantly reduced analgesic use. None of the included articles reported reduced
  health service use. CONCLUSION: Non-pharmacological interventions may be effective
  in reducing pain in paediatric patients with SCD. However, due to the heterogeneity
  of the included studies a quantitative analysis could not be performed. Awaiting
  further supporting evidence, healthcare providers should consider implementing these
  interventions as valuable part of a comprehensive pain management strategy plan.'
