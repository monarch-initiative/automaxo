input_text: 'Blood pressure thresholds for the diagnosis of hypertensive disorders
  of pregnancy in sickle cell disease.In this retrospective cohort study of singleton
  pregnancies in people with sickle cell disease (SCD) delivered at two academic centres
  between 1990 and 2021, we collected demographic and SCD-related data, pregnancy
  outcomes, and the highest systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP) at
  seven time periods. We compared the characteristics of subjects with new or worsening
  proteinuria (NWP) during pregnancy to those without. We then constructed receiver
  operating characteristic (ROC) curves to determine the blood pressure (BP) that
  best identifies those with NWP. The SBP or DBP thresholds which maximized sensitivity
  and specificity were 120 mmHg SBP (sensitivity: 55.2%, specificity: 73.5%) and 70
  mmHg DBP (sensitivity: 27.6%, specificity: 67.7%). The existing BP threshold of
  140/90 mmHg lacked sensitivity in both genotype groups (HbSS/HbSbeta0 : SBP = 21%
  sensitive, DBP = 5.3% sensitive; HbSS/HbSbeta+ : SBP = 10% sensitive, DBP = 0% sensitive).
  Finally, percent change in SBP, DBP and MAP were all poor tests for identifying
  NWP. Existing BP thresholds used to diagnose hypertensive disorders of pregnancy
  (HDP) are not sensitive for pregnant people with SCD. For this population, lowering
  the BP threshold that defines HDP may improve identification of those who need increased
  observation, consideration of early delivery and eclampsia prophylaxis.'
