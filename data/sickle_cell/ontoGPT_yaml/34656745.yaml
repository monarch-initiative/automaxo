input_text: 'Biopsychosocial factors related to transition among adolescents and young
  adults with sickle cell disease: A systematic review. It is critical to support
  adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with sickle cell disease (SCD) during transition
  to adult healthcare. We provide a systematic review of literature related to biopsychosocial
  influences on transition among AYAs with SCD. Data sources included studies published
  between January 2010 and May 2020. Forty-four studies were included. Biopsychosocial
  factors related to improved transition outcomes included older AYA age, greater
  disease severity, intact neurocognitive functioning, and greater pain coping skills.
  Financial and insurance barriers were noted. The importance of cultural considerations
  and provider communication were noted across two qualitative studies. Ten studies
  assessed efficacy of transition interventions, with 80 % resulting in improvements;
  however, retention in programs was low and gaps in knowledge and skills remained.
  Incorporation of early, ongoing assessments of transition readiness and barriers
  into culturally-tailored interventions aimed at improving transition outcomes is
  recommended. Examination of longitudinal relationships and interactions across biopsychosocial
  influences is needed.'
