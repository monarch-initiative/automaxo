input_text: An Overview of Solid Organ Transplantation in Patients With Sickle Cell
  Disease. Sickle cell disease is a common genetic disorder affecting >300 000 people
  across the world. The vast majority of patients cared for in high-resource settings
  live well into adulthood, but many develop a high burden of disease complications.
  Good standard of care including disease-modifying agents and transfusion programs
  limits the number of patients who develop end-stage organ disease, but for those
  that do, the prognosis can be very poor. Solid organ transplantation is a well-established
  mode of treatment for patients with sickle cell disease and kidney or liver failure,
  but appropriate patient selection and perioperative management are important for
  achieving good outcomes. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and gene therapy
  may offer novel treatment options for adult patients with chronic organ damage in
  the future, but these are not yet widely available. For now, good, holistic care
  and early intervention of end-organ complications can minimize the number of patients
  requiring solid organ transplantation later in life.
