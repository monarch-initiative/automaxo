input_text: 'The influence of body mass index on airway resistance in children with
  sickle cell disease: A longitudinal study based on impulse oscillometry.BACKGROUND:
  Impulse oscillometry (IOS) is an effective tool for assessing airway mechanics and
  diagnosing obstructive airway disease (OAD) in children with sickle cell disease
  (C-SCD). Obesity is known to be associated with OAD, and untreated OAD often leads
  to hypoxia-related complications in C-SCD. Considering the increasing prevalence
  of obesity in C-SCD, it is important to explore the influence of body mass index
  (BMI) on OAD in this disease population. METHODS: A longitudinal retrospective chart
  review was conducted on 55 C-SCD (161 IOS observations) and 35 non-SCD asthmatic
  children (C-Asthma) (58 observations), primarily to investigate the association
  between BMI and airway resistance in C-SCD and C-Asthma. We conducted generalized
  linear mixed models (GLMM), adjusted for pharmacotherapies, to demonstrate the influence
  of BMI on total (R5), central (R20), and peripheral (R5-20) airway resistance and
  reactance (X5, resonant frequency (Fres)). We further compared age, BMI, and IOS
  indices between C-SCD and C-Asthma using the Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: Age and
  BMI were not statistically different between the two groups. In C-SCD, BMI was associated
  with R5 (GLMM t-statistics:3.75, 95%CI:1.01,3.27, p-value<0.001*) and R20 (t-statistics:4.01,
  95%CI:1.04,1.15, p-value<0.001*), but not with R5-20 or airway reactance. In asthmatics,
  BMI was not associated with IOS estimates except Fres (t-statistics: 3.93, 95%CI:
  -0.06, -0.02, p-value<0.001*). C-SCD demonstrated higher airway resistances (R5
  and R20) and reactance (Fres) compared to C-Asthma (Mann-Whitney: p-values<0.05).
  CONCLUSION: BMI significantly influenced total and central airway resistance in
  C-SCD. While higher airway resistances reflected increased OAD in C-SCD than asthmatics,
  higher Fres perhaps indicated progressive pulmonary involvement in C-SCD.'
