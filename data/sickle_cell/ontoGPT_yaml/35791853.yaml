input_text: 'Barriers and Facilitators to Chronic Red Cell Transfusion Therapy in
  Pediatric Sickle Cell Anemia. Background: Chronic red cell transfusion (CRCT) therapy
  is one of a few effective disease-modifying therapies for children with sickle cell
  anemia (SCA). CRCT is recommended for primary and secondary stroke prevention for
  at-risk children with SCA and is sometimes used for other disease-related complications.
  However, CRCT can be resource- and time-intensive for patients/families, providers,
  and organizations. This study was conducted to provide a comprehensive, multilevel
  examination of barriers and facilitators to transfusion therapy in children with
  SCA from health care provider and caregiver perspectives. Methods: A qualitative
  descriptive approach was used to conduct key informant interviews in a sample of
  26 caregivers and 25 providers across the United States. Interviews were analyzed
  using directed content analysis with the Multilevel Ecological Model of Health as
  an initial coding framework and the constant comparison method. Results: Ten barrier
  themes and 10 facilitator themes emerged across all ecological levels. Themes most
  commonly occurred on the patient and organizational levels. Key barriers themes
  included Logistical Challenges, Obtaining and Maintaining Venous Access, Alloantibodies/Alloimmunization
  and Reactions, and Iron Overload and Adherence to Chelation Therapy. Key facilitator
  themes included Nursing and Non-nursing Staff Support, Positive Child/Family Experiences,
  Logistical Help and Social Resources, Blood Bank and Access to Blood, and Transfusion-Specific
  Resources. Discussion: The comprehensive understanding of multilevel barriers and
  facilitators to transfusion therapy, including the role of nursing, in children
  with SCA can inform strategies to improve CRCT for patients/families and providers
  and can also be applied by organizations seeking to implement transfusion services
  for SCA.'
