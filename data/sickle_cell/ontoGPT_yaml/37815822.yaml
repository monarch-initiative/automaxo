input_text: 'Altered pain processing and sensitization in sickle cell disease: a scoping
  review of quantitative sensory testing findings.OBJECTIVES: Over 50% of adults living
  with sickle cell disease have chronic pain, but the underlying mechanisms of chronic
  pain in this population remain unclear. Quantitative sensory testing is an important
  measurement tool for understanding pain and sensory processing. This scoping review
  summarizes quantitative sensory testing methodologies used in sickle cell studies
  and the evidence for central sensitization in this population. METHODS: We conducted
  a systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL to identify studies using quantitative
  sensory testing in individuals living with sickle cell disease. Search strategies
  were based on variations of the terms "sickle cell disease," and "quantitative sensory
  testing." Eligible studies were observational or experimental studies in human participants
  living with SCD that reported findings and detailed methodology for at least one
  quantitative sensory testing modality. RESULTS: Our search yielded a total of 274
  records; 27 of which are included in this scoping review. Of the 27 studies, 17
  were original studies (with combined total of 516 adult and 298 pediatric participants)
  and 10 were secondary or subgroup analyses of these prior studies. Significant variation
  existed in quantitative sensory testing methodologies across studies, including
  testing locations, type and intensity of stimuli, and interpretation of findings.
  Of the identified studies, 22% (2/9 studies) reported sensory abnormalities in mechanical
  sensitivity and thresholds, 22% (2/9 studies) reported abnormal pressure pain thresholds,
  46% (6/13 studies) reported sensory abnormalities in thermal pain thresholds and
  tolerance (cold and warm), and 50% (2/4 studies) reported abnormalities in temporal
  summation. CONCLUSION: Future studies should use standardized quantitative sensory
  testing protocols with consistent and operationalized definitions of sensitization
  to provide clear insight about pain processing and central sensitization in sickle
  cell disease.'
