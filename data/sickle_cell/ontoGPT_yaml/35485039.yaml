input_text: "[Self-management of pain crisis in patients with sickle cell disease].
  Introduction : Sickle cell disease, while it is the most common genetic disease
  in France, is little known to caregivers and the general public.Context : Only a
  few studies have examined the daily lives of people suffering from this disease.Objectives
  : The purpose of this project was to describe the specific strategies helping adult
  patients to manage the symptoms of their disease.Method : To reach this objective,
  a qualitative study was conducted among eight homozygous (SS) people over 30 years
  old living in the Ile-de-France region of France. The semi-structured interviews
  took place at the patients' homes, selected from several regional competence centers
  and on social media. An inductive methodology and a thematic analysis were used
  to draw the conclusions of this research.Results : They show that pain and suffering
  are patients' main complaints. Patients suffering from sickle cell disease seek
  numerous effective self-care strategies to manage their long-term pain : preventive
  measures and drugs, as well as complementary and alternative medicine.Discussion
  : A sociological approach shows us the considerable work that patients undertake
  to manage symptoms daily.Conclusion : The findings support interventions that would
  increase the feeling of control over the disease through better self-awareness and
  appropriate physical activity."
