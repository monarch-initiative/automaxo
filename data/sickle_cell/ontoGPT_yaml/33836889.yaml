input_text: "A Qualitative Analysis of State Medicaid Coverage Benefits for Allogeneic
  Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (alloHCT) for Patients with Sickle Cell Disease
  (SCD).Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common inherited hemoglobin disorder,
  affecting approximately 100,000 people in the United States. Allogeneic hematopoietic
  cell transplantation (alloHCT), also known as bone marrow transplant (BMT), is currently
  the only established curative option for SCD. However, alloHCT is an optional benefit
  under Medicaid. This study of alloHCT coverage for patients with SCD aims to understand
  the scope of state Medicaid coverage benefits and BMT financial coordinators' experience
  working with their state Medicaid programs. States estimated to have more than 50
  newborns diagnosed with SCD in 2016 and at least one active BMT Clinical Trials
  Network (1503 [STRIDE 2], NCT02766465) transplant center (TC) were eligible to participate
  in this study. Qualitative, semi-structured interviews 30 to 60 minutes in length
  were conducted with BMT financial coordinators via telephone between May and October
  2019. A total of 10 BMT financial coordinators from 10 TCs representing eight states
  (Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Michigan, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Virginia)
  participated in the semi-structured interviews. Coordinators in all of the included
  states reported that alloHCT in children with SCD with a human leukocyte antigen-matched
  sibling donor was covered by their state Medicaid programs. However, only two states
  (Florida and Texas) had legislative policies mandating coverage of routine medical
  costs for patients in clinical trials. TCs in two states (Illinois and Pennsylvania)
  reported accepting out-of-state Medicaid insurance, but only one state (Michigan)
  covered both travel and lodging for the patient and one caregiver. Four themes emerged
  when coordinators were asked about their perspectives and experiences working with
  their corresponding state Medicaid programs: (1) state Medicaid eligibility criteria
  based on disability were perceived as being restrictive, and Medicaid reimbursement
  rates were reported to be low; (2) Medicaid fee-for-service plans were perceived
  as being more comprehensive and easier to navigate compared to comprehensive managed
  care (CMC) plans; (3) there is a need to address caregiver and financial assistance
  beyond the health care costs; and (4) completing the insurance authorization process
  leading up to alloHCT is critical, including peer-to-peer reviews. There is limited
  legislative policy to help ensure access to clinical trials and provide out-of-state
  benefits and travel and lodging for Medicaid enrollees with SCD. These data provide
  insight into potential areas that could influence changes in policy to enhance access
  to curative therapy for SCD."
