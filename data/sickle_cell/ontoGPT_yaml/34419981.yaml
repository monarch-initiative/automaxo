input_text: "Core Decompression and Bone Marrow Aspirate Concentrate in the Treatment
  of Femoral Head Avascular Necrosis in Pediatric Sickle Cell Disease: Can We Improve
  Natural History? INTRODUCTION: Femoral head avascular necrosis (AVN) affects between
  10% and 41% of children with sickle cell disease (SCD), resulting in the development
  of proximal femoral deformity and residual hip pain in the majority of patients
  without treatment. There have been multiple adult studies published on the outcomes
  of core decompression with and without the use of bone marrow aspirate concentrate
  (BMAC) injection both in idiopathic and SCD-related AVN with promising results,
  however, few studies have reported on outcomes in skeletally immature patients.
  PURPOSE: This study sought to report on a single surgeon's outcomes for core decompression
  with BMAC injection in pediatric patients with AVN of the femoral head secondary
  to underlying SCD. METHODS: A single-center, retrospective review was performed
  for pediatric patients undergoing core decompression with BMAC injection for femoral
  head AVN in patients with SCD with a minimum of 12-month follow-up. Demographic,
  radiographic, and clinical variable were collected. Patients were subdivided based
  upon presence of open femoral physes at the time of surgery. Successful treatment
  was defined as the ability to return to activities without limitations. RESULTS:
  A total of 13 patients (average age 14.1+-2.8 y, 84.6% male, 6 skeletally immature
  and 7 skeletally mature) with 18 affected extremities were identified. Open physes
  were present in 50% of operative extremities. Skeletally immature patient demonstrated
  reconstitution of the femoral head in 78% of cases and 89% demonstrated regression
  of at least 1 Steinberg grade and none had progression. Skeletally immature patients
  were significantly more likely to return to activities (100% vs. 55.6%, P=0.023)
  and achieve a final Tonnis grade <2 (89% vs. 44%, P=0.046). CONCLUSION: Core decompression
  appears to alter the natural history of AVN in skeletally immature patients with
  SCD. Skeletal immaturity was a positive prognostic factor for the ability to return
  to activities without pain and achieve a lower Tonnis grade at final follow-up."
