input_text: "Evidence-Based Minireview: In young children with severe sickle cell
  disease, do the benefits of HLA-identical sibling donor HCT outweigh the risks?
  In case 1, a 14-month-old male child with sickle cell disease (SCD) was referred
  for evaluation for an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT). The patient
  had a history of dactylitis 3 times in his first year of life and febrile episodes
  twice at the consult. His 4-year-old sister was found to be human leukocyte antigen
  (HLA) identical. The patient was started on hydroxyurea (HU) at 2.5 years of age.
  His parents again sought consultation when he was 5 years old because of concerns
  about his medical condition. At the time, the patient had experienced 2 vaso-occlusive
  pain episodes (VOEs) requiring hospitalization during the previous 2 years. He had
  also experienced intermittent pain crises requiring rest at home for 2 to 3 days.
  The child has not attended school in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The family
  is considering HCT but is ambivalent about it because of potential toxicity. In
  case 2, an 8-year-old female child is 3 years out from HCT for SCD from her HLA-identical
  sibling. Before HCT, despite receiving HU, she had experienced >5 VOEs requiring
  hospitalization and 2 episodes of acute chest syndromes in the previous 3 years.
  She had also been missing almost 50 days of school days each year. After HCT, she
  is now attending school regularly and participating in all normal age-appropriate
  activities. The parents believe that HCT has been transformative in their child's
  life."
