input_text: 'Cerebrovascular and cardiovascular autonomic regulation in sickle cell
  patients with white matter lesions.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: White matter lesions
  (WMLs) are frequent in sickle cell disease (SCD), with a prevalence described to
  be as high as 53% by age 30. Cerebrovascular regulation and cardiovascular autonomic
  regulation, more specifically the sympatho-vagal balance, can be altered in SCD.
  In this study the association between WMLs, cerebrovascular regulation and sympatho-vagal
  balance was assessed in SCD patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: Sickle cell disease patients
  with no history of stroke were prospectively evaluated for cerebrovascular reactivity
  using the breath-holding test (BHT), the sympatho-vagal balance (ratio low frequency/high
  frequency [HF]) using heart rate variability parameters and cerebral autoregulation
  in the time domain using correlation index Mx, and arterial cerebral compliance
  based on continuous assessment of cerebral blood flow velocities using transcranial
  Doppler ultrasound and arterial blood pressure with photo-plethysmography. WMLs
  were assessed with magnetic resonance imaging using Fazekas score grading and the
  presence of lacunes. Forty-one patients (F/M 25/16) were included. Median age was
  37.5 years (19-65). Twenty-nine (70.7%) patients had SS genotype. Eleven patients
  had WMLs (26.8%). Patients with WMLs were significantly older (p < 0.001), had a
  lower HF (p < 0.005) and an impaired cerebral arterial compliance (p < 0.014). The
  receiver operating curve for the regression model including age and HF showed a
  higher area under the curve compared to age alone (0.946 vs. 0.876). BHT and Mx
  did not significantly differ between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Lower parasympathetic
  activity and impaired cerebral arterial compliance were associated with WMLs in
  adults with SCD. This could potentially yield to a better understanding of pathophysiological
  parameters leading to premature cerebrovascular ageing in SCD.'
