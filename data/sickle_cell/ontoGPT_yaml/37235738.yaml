input_text: 'Transfusion in hemoglobinopathies and red blood cell alloimmunization:
  data from Sicily, Sardinia and Malta. BACKGROUND: Hemoglobinopathies are a group
  of diseases that include those due to globin gene mutations, such as thalassemia
  major (TM) and thalassemia intermedia (TI) or due to alteration of hemoglobin structure
  such as sickle cell disease (SCD), as well as a combination of these conditions
  such as thalasso-drepanocytosis (TD). They constitute the most frequent hereditary
  anemias requiring blood transfusion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In April 2022, a questionnaire
  was sent to the Transfusion Services (TS) of Sicily, Sardinia and the Maltese National
  Blood Transfusion (MNBT) service. The questionnaire was divided into a generic part
  including the number of patients followed and the type of hemoglobinopathy, and
  a section relating to transfusion therapy, including the number of units transfused,
  whether red blood cells (RBC) were washed and, finally, a section relating to the
  presence or absence of alloantibodies and their identification. RESULTS: Data was
  retrieved for 2,574 patients: 68.6% TM, 15.4% TI, 10.3% TD, 4.1% SCD, and 1.6% other
  hemoglobinopathies (OHA). The number of RBC units transfused was 76,974, equivalent
  to 24.5% of all the RBCU transfused from the total number of patients followed.
  The number of washed RBCU was 21.1% of all the units used; 337 patients (37%) were
  diagnosed with alloantibodies, the majority of which were patients with SCD (20.6%).
  Of the 485 alloantibodies found, 90.3% were identified. The antibodies found most
  frequently were related to the Kell system (41.7%) followed by antibodies to the
  Rhesus system (37.9%); 29.7% of patients had more than one antibody. DISCUSSION:
  From our study, certain indications can be formulated: 1) complete the National
  Registry for patients with hemoglobinopathies; 2) create a Registry of alloimmunized
  patients to ensure transfusion therapy is as safe as possible, considering antibody
  evanescence; and 3) increase the recruitment of blood donors of diverse ethnicities.'
