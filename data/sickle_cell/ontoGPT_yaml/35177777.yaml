input_text: A randomised double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial of oral hydroxyurea
  for transfusion-dependent beta-thalassaemia. Hydroxyurea is an antimetabolite drug
  that induces fetal haemoglobin in sickle cell disease. However, its clinical usefulness
  in beta-thalassaemia is unproven. We conducted a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled
  clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of hydroxyurea in transfusion-dependent
  beta-thalassaemia. Sixty patients were assigned 1:1 to oral hydroxyurea 10-20 mg/kg/day
  or placebo for 6 months by stratified block randomisation. Hydroxyurea treatment
  did not alter the blood transfusion volume overall. However, a significantly higher
  proportion of patients on hydroxyurea showed increases in fetal haemoglobin percentage
  (89% vs. 59%; p < 0.05) and reductions in erythropoietic stress as measured by soluble
  transferrin receptor concentration (79% vs. 40%; p < 0.05). Based on fetal haemoglobin
  induction (> 1.5%), 44% of patients were identified as hydroxyurea-responders. Hydroxyurea-responders,
  required significantly lower blood volume (77 +- SD27ml/kg) compared to hydroxyurea-non-responders
  (108 +- SD24ml/kg; p < 0.01) and placebo-receivers (102 +- 28ml/kg; p < 0.05). Response
  to hydroxyurea was significantly higher in patients with HbE beta-thalassaemia genotype
  (50% vs. 0%; p < 0.01) and Xmn1 polymorphism of the gamma-globin gene (67% vs. 27%;
  p < 0.05). We conclude that oral hydroxyurea increased fetal haemoglobin percentage
  and reduced erythropoietic stress of ineffective erythropoiesis in patients with
  transfusion-dependent beta-thalassaemia. Hydroxyurea reduced the transfusion burden
  in approximately 40% of patients. Response to hydroxyurea was higher in patients
  with HbE beta-thalassaemia genotype and Xmn1 polymorphism of the gamma-globin gene.
