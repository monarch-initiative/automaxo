input_text: 'Cost-Effectiveness of Lovotibeglogene Autotemcel (Lovo-Cel) Gene Therapy
  for Patients with Sickle Cell Disease and Recurrent Vaso-Occlusive Events in the
  United States. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Gene therapies for sickle cell disease
  (SCD) may offer meaningful benefits for patients and society. This study evaluated
  the cost-effectiveness of lovotibeglogene autotemcel (lovo-cel), a one-time gene
  therapy administered via autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, compared
  with common care for patients in the United States (US) with SCD aged >= 12 years
  with >= 4 vaso-occlusive events (VOEs) in the past 24 months. METHODS: We developed
  a patient-level simulation model accounting for lovo-cel and SCD-related events,
  complications, and mortality over a lifetime time horizon. The pivotal phase 1/2
  HGB-206 clinical trial (NCT02140554) served as the basis for lovo-cel efficacy and
  safety. Cost, quality-of-life, and other clinical data were sourced from HGB-206
  data and the literature. Analyses were conducted from US societal and third-party
  payer perspectives. Uncertainty was assessed through probabilistic sensitivity analysis
  and extensive scenario analyses. RESULTS: Patients treated with lovo-cel were predicted
  to survive 23.84 years longer on average (standard deviation [SD], 12.80) versus
  common care (life expectancy, 62.24 versus 38.40 years), with associated discounted
  patient quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gains of 10.20 (SD, 4.10) and direct costs
  avoided of $1,329,201 (SD, $1,346,446) per patient. Predicted societal benefits
  included discounted caregiver QALY losses avoided of 1.19 (SD, 1.38) and indirect
  costs avoided of $540,416 (SD, $262,353) per patient. Including lovo-cel costs ($3,282,009
  [SD, $29,690] per patient) resulted in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of
  $191,519 and $124,051 per QALY gained from third-party payer and societal perspectives,
  respectively. In scenario analyses, the predicted cost-effectiveness of lovo-cel
  also was sensitive to baseline age and VOE frequency and to the proportion of patients
  achieving and maintaining complete resolution of VOEs. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis
  of lovo-cel gene therapy compared with common care for patients in the US with SCD
  with recurrent VOEs estimated meaningful improvements in survival, quality of life,
  and other clinical outcomes accompanied by increased overall costs for the health
  care system and for broader society. The predicted economic value of lovo-cel gene
  therapy was influenced by uncertainty in long-term clinical effects and by positive
  spillover effects on patient productivity and caregiver burden.'
