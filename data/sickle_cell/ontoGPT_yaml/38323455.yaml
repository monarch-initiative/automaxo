input_text: 'No increase in masked hypertension prevalence in children with sickle
  cell disease in France.OBJECTIVES: An important prevalence (32-45%) of masked hypertension
  has been reported in children with sickle cell disease (SCD). Systemic arterial
  rigidity has been associated with stroke in SCD. Stroke screening is well-established
  using transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound. The objectives of our proof-of-concept
  study in childhood SCD were to evaluate the prevalence of hypertension and its relationships
  with cerebral vasculopathy (TCD velocity) and to further evaluate in a subgroup
  of children the correlations of cardiovascular autonomic nervous system indices
  with TCD velocity. METHODS: Ambulatory blood pressure measurement (ABPM) and TCD
  velocity were obtained in children with SCD and in a restricted sample, cardiac
  sympathovagal balance using heart rate variability analyses, baroreflex sensitivity,
  and pulse wave velocity were measured. RESULTS: In 41 children with SCD (median
  age 14.0 years, 19 girls, SS/Sbeta+thalassemia/SC: 33/2/6), ABPM results showed
  masked hypertension in 2/41 (5%, 95% confidence interval, 0-11) children, consistent
  with the prevalence in the general pediatric population, elevated BP in 4/41 (10%)
  children, and a lack of a normal nocturnal dip in 19/41 children (46%). Children
  with increased TCD velocity had lower nocturnal dipping of systolic BP. In the 10
  participants with extensive cardiovascular assessment, increased TCD velocity was
  associated with parasympathetic withdrawal and baroreflex failure. Exaggerated orthostatic
  pressor response or orthostatic hypertension was observed in 7/10 children that
  was linked to parasympathetic withdrawal. CONCLUSION: Autonomic nervous system dysfunction,
  namely loss of parasympathetic modulation, of SCD contributes to increase TCD velocity
  but is not associated with an increased prevalence of masked hypertension.'
