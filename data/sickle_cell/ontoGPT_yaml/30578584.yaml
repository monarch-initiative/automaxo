input_text: 'Ischaemia-induced muscle metabolic abnormalities are poorly alleviated
  by endurance training in a mouse model of sickle cell disease. NEW FINDINGS: What
  is the central question of this study? The aim of this study was to evaluate the
  potential beneficial effects of endurance training during an ischaemia-reperfusion
  protocol in a mouse model of sickle cell disease (SCD). What is the main finding
  and its importance? Endurance training did not reverse the metabolic defects induced
  by a simulated vaso-occlusive crisis in SCD mice, with regard to intramuscular acidosis,
  mitochondrial dysfunction or anatomical properties. Our results suggest that endurance
  training would reduce the number of vaso-occlusive crises rather than the complications
  related to vaso-occlusive crises. ABSTRACT: The aim of this study was to investigate
  whether endurance training could limit the abnormalities described in a mouse model
  of sickle cell disease (SCD) in response to an ischaemia-reperfusion (I/R) protocol.
  Ten sedentary (HbSS-SED) and nine endurance-trained (HbSS-END) SCD mice were submitted
  to a standardized protocol of I/R of the leg, during which ATP, phosphocreatine
  and inorganic phosphate concentrations and intramuscular pH were measured using
  magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Forty-eight hours later, skeletal muscles were
  harvested. Oxidative stress markers were then measured. Although the time course
  of protons accumulation was slightly different between trained and sedentary mice
  (P < 0.05), the extent of acidosis was similar at the end of the ischaemic period.
  The initial rate of phosphocreatine resynthesis measured at blood flow restoration,
  illustrating mitochondrial function, was not altered in trained mice compared with
  sedentary mice. Although several oxidative stress markers were not different between
  groups (P > 0.05), the I/R-related increase of uric acid concentration observed
  in sedentary SCD mice (P < 0.05) was not present in the trained group. The spleen
  weight, generally used as a marker of the severity of the disease, was not different
  between groups (P > 0.05). In conclusion, endurance training did not limit the metabolic
  consequences of an I/R protocol in skeletal muscle of SCD mice, suggesting that
  the reduction in the severity of the disease previously demonstrated in the basal
  state would be attributable to a reduction of the occurrence of vaso-occlusive crises
  rather than a decrease of the deleterious effects of vaso-occlusive crises.'
