input_text: 'The impact of obstructive sleep apnea in children with sickle cell disease
  and asthma.INTRODUCTION: Asthma and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are chronic diseases
  that disproportionately affect children with sickle cell disease (SCD). The literature
  describes the negative impact that both conditions have on children with SCD separately;
  however, the effect of OSA on asthmatic children with OSA is less specific. We hypothesized
  that the presence of OSA in children with SCD and asthma is associated with specific
  hematologic markers, worse clinical outcomes, and greater healthcare utilization.
  METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated children with both SCD and asthma who underwent
  polysomnography (PSG). We assessed their demographic information, PSG data, hematologic
  indices, and healthcare utilization based on the concurrent presence of OSA. RESULTS:
  Fifty-nine percent of the cohort had OSA with a lower oxygen saturation (SpO2 )
  nadir (87% vs. 93%, p < 0.001) and a lower median daytime SpO2 (96.5% vs. 98.5%,
  p < 0.05); those with OSA were more likely to have the hemoglobin SS genotype (86%
  vs. 46.5%, p = 0.03). Additionally, those with OSA had a higher mean corpuscular
  volume (87 vs. 77.2 fL, p = 0.03) and reticulocyte count (10.1% vs. 5.5%, p < 0.01).
  There was no difference in asthma severity or healthcare utilization between those
  with OSA and those without OSA. DISCUSSION: Overall, children with SCD and asthma
  might be at increased risk for developing OSA, and screening for sleep-disordered
  breathing should be incorporated as part of their routine care.'
