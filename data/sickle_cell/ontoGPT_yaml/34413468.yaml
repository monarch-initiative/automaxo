input_text: 'A prospective cohort study on the intersectionality of obesity, chronic
  disease, social factors, and incident risk of COVID-19 in US low-income minority
  middle-age mothers.OBJECTIVE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has disproportionally
  affected communities of color. We aimed to determine what factors are associated
  with COVID-19 testing and test positivity in an underrepresented, understudied,
  and underreported (U3) population of mothers. METHODS: This study included 2996
  middle-aged mothers of the Boston Birth Cohort (a sample of predominantly urban,
  low-income, Black and Hispanic mothers) who were enrolled shortly after they gave
  birth and followed onward at the Boston Medical Center. COVID-19 testing and test
  positivity were defined by the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test. Two-probit Heckman
  selection models were performed to identify factors associated with test positivity
  while accounting for potential selection associated with COVID testing. RESULTS:
  The mean (SD) age of study mothers was 41.9 (+-7.7) years. In the sample, 1741 (58.1%)
  and 667 (22.3%) mothers were self-identified as Black and Hispanic, respectively.
  A total of 396 mothers had COVID-19 testing and of those, 95 mothers tested positive
  from March 2020 to February 2021. Among a multitude of factors examined, factors
  associated with the probability of being tested were obesity (RR = 1.27; 95% confidence
  interval (CI): 1.08-1.49); and presence of preexisting chronic medical conditions
  including hypertension, asthma, stroke, and other comorbidities (coronary heart
  disease, chronic kidney disease, and sickle cell disease) with a corresponding RR
  = 1.40 (95% CI: 1.23-1.60); 1.29 (95% CI: 1.11-1.50); 1.44 (95% CI: 1.23-1.68);
  and 1.37 (95% CI: 1.12-1.67), respectively. Factors associated with higher incident
  risk of a positive COVID-19 test were body mass index, birthplace outside of the
  USA, and being without a college-level education. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated
  the intersectionality of obesity and social factors in modulating incident risk
  of COVID-19 in this sample of US Black and Hispanic middle-aged mothers. Methodologically,
  our findings underscore the importance of accounting for potential selection bias
  in COVID-19 testing in order to obtain unbiased estimates of COVID-19 infection.'
