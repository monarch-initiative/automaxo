input_text: 'Effects of prophylactic red blood cell (RBC) transfusion with extended
  antigen matching on alloimmunization in patients with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD).
  BACKGROUND: RBC alloimmunization remains a significant problem for many patients
  with SCD. To reduce alloimmunization some strategies have been implemented to provide
  limited or extended antigen matched RBC transfusions to patients with SCD who need
  chronic transfusion support. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of
  prophylactic RBC transfusion with extended antigen matching on alloimmunization
  in patients with SCD. METHODS: This is a 20-year retrospective study of patients
  with SCD transfused with RBCS that were prospectively matched for D, C, c, E, e,
  K, Fya/Fyb, Jka/Jkb and S antigens. Our study included 95 patients, and none had
  antibodies documented before their first transfusion. Patients and donors were phenotyped
  and molecular typing was performed in all patients who had recent transfusions or
  a positive direct antiglobulin test to predict their antigen profile. Unexpected
  antibodies to the Rh system, meaning anti-Rh antibodies in patients whose serologic
  phenotype was Rh positive, were investigated by molecular genotyping for RH variant
  alleles. RESULTS: During this study-period, 12 (12.6%) were alloimmunized and 83
  (87.4%) were not. Among the 12 patients who alloimmunized, 7 (58.3%) developed antibodies
  to Rh antigens and 5 (41.7%) produced antibodies to low prevalence antigens. All
  patients who developed Rh antibodies had RH variant alleles. Autoantibodies were
  found in 16 (16.8%) transfused patients. CONCLUSION: SCD patients benefit from receiving
  prophylactic RBC transfusions with extended antigen matching, as demonstrated by
  the reduction on the rates of alloimmunization and the lack of antibodies to K,
  FY, JK and S antigens, however, this strategy does not avoid alloimmunization to
  Rh and low-prevalence antigens.'
