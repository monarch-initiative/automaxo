input_text: 'Effects of prophylactic red blood cell (RBC) transfusion with extended
  antigen matching on alloimmunization in patients with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD).BACKGROUND:
  RBC alloimmunization remains a significant problem for many patients with SCD. To
  reduce alloimmunization some strategies have been implemented to provide limited
  or extended antigen matched RBC transfusions to patients with SCD who need chronic
  transfusion support. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of prophylactic
  RBC transfusion with extended antigen matching on alloimmunization in patients with
  SCD. METHODS: This is a 20-year retrospective study of patients with SCD transfused
  with RBCS that were prospectively matched for D, C, c, E, e, K, Fya/Fyb, Jka/Jkb
  and S antigens. Our study included 95 patients, and none had antibodies documented
  before their first transfusion. Patients and donors were phenotyped and molecular
  typing was performed in all patients who had recent transfusions or a positive direct
  antiglobulin test to predict their antigen profile. Unexpected antibodies to the
  Rh system, meaning anti-Rh antibodies in patients whose serologic phenotype was
  Rh positive, were investigated by molecular genotyping for RH variant alleles. RESULTS:
  During this study-period, 12 (12.6%) were alloimmunized and 83 (87.4%) were not.
  Among the 12 patients who alloimmunized, 7 (58.3%) developed antibodies to Rh antigens
  and 5 (41.7%) produced antibodies to low prevalence antigens. All patients who developed
  Rh antibodies had RH variant alleles. Autoantibodies were found in 16 (16.8%) transfused
  patients. CONCLUSION: SCD patients benefit from receiving prophylactic RBC transfusions
  with extended antigen matching, as demonstrated by the reduction on the rates of
  alloimmunization and the lack of antibodies to K, FY, JK and S antigens, however,
  this strategy does not avoid alloimmunization to Rh and low-prevalence antigens.'
