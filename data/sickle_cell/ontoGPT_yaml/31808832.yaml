input_text: Optimal disease management and health monitoring in adults with sickle
  cell disease. In countries with access to organized health care, survival of children
  with sickle cell disease (SCD) has greatly improved, resulting in a growing population
  of adults with SCD. Transition from pediatric to adult care presents many challenges
  for the patient, who now faces the reality of emerging complications in many organs
  that are cumulative, adding to other age-related nonsickle conditions that interact
  and add to the disease morbidity. We recommend regular comprehensive annual assessments,
  monitoring for early signs of organ damage and joint clinics with relevant specialists,
  if applicable. While maintaining a low threshold for intervention with disease-modifying
  therapies, we should always keep in mind that there is no single complication that
  is pathognomonic of SCD, and nonsickle comorbidities should always be excluded and
  treated if present. We need to reevaluate our approach to managing adults with SCD
  by putting a greater emphasis on multidisciplinary care while proactively considering
  curative options (hematopoietic stem cell transplant and gene therapy) and experimental
  pharmacological agents for adults with SCD of all ages before complications render
  the patients ineligible for these treatments.
