input_text: 'Transition for Adolescents and Young Adults With Sickle Cell Disease
  in a US Midwest Urban Center: A Multilevel Perspective on Barriers, Facilitators,
  and Future Directions. BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD), an inherited red blood
  cell disorder, primarily affects African Americans in the United States. Adolescents
  and young adults with SCD (AYA-SCD) are at risk of high morbidity and mortality
  when transitioning from pediatric to adult care. The goal of this qualitative study
  was to understand factors associated with optimal implementation of the AYA-SCD
  transition. METHODS: Participants were recruited from a large hospital system and
  the community. Interview guides included topics on access to primary and specialized
  care, beliefs and practices related to pain control, transition from pediatric to
  adult care, and patient experiences in the emergency department. Data were coded
  and analyzed using an inductive thematic coding approach in combination with a deductive
  coding approach using domains from the Consolidated Framework for Implementation
  Research (CFIR). RESULTS: Fifty-nine participants, including 21 AYA-SCD from both
  the pediatric and adult clinics, 17 caregivers, 9 pediatric SCD providers, 6 adult
  SCD providers, and 6 emergency department providers, completed 11 focus groups and
  5 semistructured interviews. Results identified multiple factors within the domains
  of CFIR including the outer setting, inner setting, individual characteristics,
  and intervention characteristics. Results were incorporated into a transition framework
  to inform local practice improvement. CONCLUSION: Our study highlights the importance
  of multilevel barriers and facilitators for AYA-SCD transition from pediatric to
  adult care. Future studies could use implementation science frameworks to understand
  local context and identify strategies and intervention characteristics to improve
  transition programming. These efforts will ultimately reduce health disparities
  and ensure health equity.'
