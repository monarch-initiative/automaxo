input_text: The nephropathy of sickle cell trait and sickle cell disease.Sickle cell
  syndromes, including sickle cell disease (SCD) and sickle cell trait, are associated
  with multiple kidney abnormalities. Young patients with SCD have elevated effective
  renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rates, which decrease to normal ranges
  in young adulthood and subnormal levels with advancing age. The pathophysiology
  of SCD-related nephropathy is multifactorial - oxidative stress, hyperfiltration
  and glomerular hypertension are all contributing factors. Albuminuria, which is
  an early clinical manifestation of glomerular damage, is common in individuals with
  SCD. Kidney function declines more rapidly in individuals with SCD than in those
  with sickle cell trait or in healthy individuals. Multiple genetic modifiers, including
  APOL1, HMOX1, HBA1 and HBA2 variants are also implicated in the development and
  progression of SCD-related nephropathy. Chronic kidney disease and rapid decline
  in estimated glomerular filtration rate are associated with increased mortality
  in adults with SCD. Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors are the standard
  of care treatment for albuminuria in SCD, despite a lack of controlled studies demonstrating
  their long-term efficacy. Multiple studies of novel therapeutic agents are ongoing,
  and patients with SCD and kidney failure should be evaluated for kidney transplantation.
  Given the high prevalence and severe consequences of kidney disease, additional
  studies are needed to elucidate the pathophysiology, natural history and treatment
  of SCD-related nephropathy.
