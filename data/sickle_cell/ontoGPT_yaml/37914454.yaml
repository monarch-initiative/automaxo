input_text: 'SCULP study: The benefits of skin graft pellets on the pain of sickle
  cell leg ulcers (SCLU). BACKGROUND: Leg ulcers associated with major sickle cell
  disease (SCLU) are a chronic, painful complication, often treated by autologous
  skin graft. The analgesic effect of skin grafting in SCLU is poorly studied. The
  aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of skin grafting on the pain and healing
  of SCLU. METHODS: Patients hospitalized for SCLU skin grafting were included in
  a retrospective and prospective observational cohort, between 2019 and 2023: 53
  autologous pinch grafts were performed on a total of 35 SCLUs in 25 sickle cell
  patients. The primary endpoint was the evaluation of the analgesic effect of the
  skin graft, measured by visual analog scale (VAS) and weekly cumulative analgesic
  consumption between day (D)0, D7 and D30. Wound healing was assessed by variation
  in wound areas between D0 and D30. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients with a median age
  range of 45.5years old were included, 68% were men, SS genotype was present in 96%
  of the cases. At D7, a significant decrease in VAS and consumption of analgesics
  of all classes was observed. At D30, only a significant decrease in VAS and consumption
  of mild opioids was present, as well as a significant reduction in wound surface
  area compared with D0. CONCLUSION: Pinch grafts have a significant early analgesic
  effect in the management of patients with SCLU, and significantly notice reduction
  of wound surface area within one month.'
