input_text: 'Lung Clearance Index May Detect Early Peripheral Lung Disease in Sickle
  Cell Anemia.Rationale: Chronic lung injury is common in sickle cell anemia (SCA)
  and worsens outcomes. Sensitive lung function tests might predict reversible disease
  that might benefit from therapeutic interventions. Objectives: To evaluate whether
  lung clearance index (LCI) (measuring global ventilation inhomogeneity), intraacinar
  ventilation inhomogeneity (Sacin), and conductive ventilation inhomogeneity (Scond)
  are more frequently abnormal than lung volumes in young people with SCA. Methods:
  Nitrogen multiple-breath washout, spirometry, and body plethysmography were cross-sectionally
  evaluated at steady state in subjects with SCA (hemoglobin SS) and healthy control
  subjects aged 8-21 years from London, United Kingdom. Results: Thirty-five patients
  (51% boys, mean +- SD age, 16.4 +- 3.5 yr) and 31 control subjects (48% boys; 16.2
  +- 3.2 yr) were tested. There were significant differences between the study and
  control groups in mean LCI (mean difference, 0.42 units; 95% confidence interval
  [CI], 0.22 to 0.63; P = 0.0001), Sacin (mean difference, 0.014 units; 95% CI, 0.001
  to 0.026; P = 0.04), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) (mean difference,
  -0.79 z-scores; 95% CI, -1.28 to -0.30; P = 0.002), forced vital capacity (FVC)
  (mean difference, -0.80 z-scores; 95% CI, -1.28 to -0.31, P = 0.002), and total
  lung capacity (mean difference, -0.76 z-scores; 95% CI, -1.25 to -0.29, P = 0.002),
  but not in Scond and FEV1-to-FVC ratio. Whereas 29% (10 of 35) of patients had LCI
  > 95th percentile of control subjects, 23% (8 of 35) had abnormal FEV1 (<5th percentile
  of the reference population). Conclusions: LCI detected slightly more abnormalities
  than lung volumes in young people with SCA. Significant differences from control
  subjects in LCI and Sacin but not in Scond and FEV1-to-FVC ratio suggest that the
  lung function changes were most likely owing to patchy peripheral lung disease.'
