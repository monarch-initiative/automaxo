input_text: The evolving treatment landscape for children with sickle cell disease.
  Sickle cell disease is the most common inherited pathological haemoglobinopathy.
  Over the past 30 years, disease-related morbidity and mortality have improved in
  high-income countries due to advances in preventive care and treatments. Established
  disease-modifying therapies, such as hydroxyurea (hydrocarbamide), are continuing
  to have an important role in the treatment of sickle cell disease, and newer agents
  also show promise. In the past 5 years, the US Food and Drug Administration approved
  three additional sickle cell disease-modifying medications, and new gene therapies
  have been developed as an alternative curative treatment to haematopoietic stem-cell
  transplantation. In this Review, we discuss the current treatment landscape for
  paediatric sickle cell disease and emerging innovations in care. We also review
  the need for close, long-term management for children receiving newer therapies
  and the importance of ongoing investment in people with sickle cell disease in low-income
  and middle-income countries.
