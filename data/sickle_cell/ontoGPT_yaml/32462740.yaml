input_text: "Vitamin D supplementation for sickle cell disease. BACKGROUND: Sickle
  cell disease (SCD) is a genetic chronic haemolytic and pro-inflammatory disorder.
  With increased catabolism and deficits in energy and nutrient intake, individuals
  with SCD suffer multiple macro- and micro-nutritional deficiencies, including vitamin
  D deficiency. This is an update of a previous review. OBJECTIVES: To investigate
  the effects of vitamin D supplementation in children and adults with SCD and to
  compare different dose regimens. To determine the effects of vitamin D supplementation
  on general health (e.g. growth status and health-related quality of life), on musculoskeletal
  health (including bone mineral density, pain crises, bone fracture and muscle health),
  on respiratory health (including lung function, acute chest syndrome, acute exacerbation
  of asthma and respiratory infections) and the safety of vitamin D supplementation.
  SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, compiled
  from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract
  books. Date of last search: 19 March 2020. We also searched database such as PubMed,
  clinical trial registries and the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews.
  Date of last search: 14 January 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled
  trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing oral administration of any form of vitamin
  D supplementation at any dose and for any duration to another type or dose of vitamin
  D or placebo or no supplementation in people with SCD, of all ages, gender, and
  phenotypes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently extracted the
  data and assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. They used the GRADE
  guidelines to assess the quality of the evidence. MAIN RESULTS: Vitamin D versus
  placebo One double-blind RCT (n = 39) compared oral vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol)
  supplementation (20 participants) to placebo (19 participants) for six weeks. Only
  25 participants completed the full six months of follow-up. The study had a high
  risk of bias due to incomplete outcome data, but a low risk of bias for randomisation,
  allocation concealment, blinding (of participants, personnel and outcome assessors)
  and selective outcome reporting; and an unclear risk of other biases. Vitamin D
  supplementation probably led to higher serum 25(OH)D levels at eight weeks, mean
  difference (MD) 29.79 (95% confidence interval (CI) 26.63 to 32.95); at 16 weeks,
  MD 12.67 (95% CI 10.43 to 14.90); and at 24 weeks, MD 15.52 (95% CI 13.50 to 17.54)
  (moderate-quality evidence). There was little or no difference in adverse events
  (tingling of lips or hands) between the vitamin D and placebo groups, risk ratio
  3.16 (95% CI 0.14 to 72.84) (low-quality evidence). Vitamin D supplementation probably
  caused fewer pain days compared to the placebo group at eight weeks, MD -10.00 (95%
  CI -16.47 to -3.53) (low-quality evidence), but probably led to a lower (worse)
  health-related quality of life score (change from baseline in physical functioning
  PedsQL scores); at both 16 weeks, MD -12.56 (95% CI -16.44 to -8.69) and 24 weeks,
  MD -12.59 (95% CI -17.43 to -7.76), although this may not be the case at eight weeks
  (low-quality evidence). Vitamin D supplementation regimens compared Two double-blind
  RCTs (83 participants) compared different regimens of vitamin D. One RCT (n = 62)
  compared oral vitamin D3 7000 IU/day to 4000 IU/day for 12 weeks, while the second
  RCT (n = 21) compared oral vitamin D3 100,000 IU/month to 12,000 IU/month for 24
  months. Both RCTs had low risk of bias for blinding (of participants, personnel
  and outcome assessors) and incomplete outcome data, but the risk of selective outcome
  reporting bias was high. The bias from randomisation and allocation concealment
  was low in one study but not in the second. There was an unclear risk of other biases.
  When comparing oral vitamin D 100,000 IU/month to 12,000 IU/month, the higher dose
  may have resulted in higher serum 25(OH)D levels at one year, MD 16.40 (95% CI 12.59
  to 20.21) and at two years, MD 18.96 (95% CI 15.20 to 22.72) (low-quality evidence).
  There was little or no difference in adverse events between doses (low-quality evidence).
  There were more episodes of acute chest syndrome in the high-dose group, at one
  year, MD 0.27 (95% CI 0.02 to 0.52) but there was little or no difference at two
  years, MD 0.09 (95% CI -0.04 to 0.22) (moderate-quality evidence). At one year and
  two years there was also little or no difference between the doses in the presence
  of pain (moderate-quality evidence) or forced expiratory volume in one second %
  predicted. However, the high-dose group had lower values for % predicted forced
  vital capacity at both one and two years, MD -7.20% predicted (95% CI -14.15 to
  -0.25) and MD -7.10% predicted (95% CI -14.03 to -0.17), respectively. There were
  little or no differences between dose regimens in the muscle health of either hand
  or the dominant hand. The study comparing oral vitamin D3 7000 IU/day to 4000 IU/day
  (21 participants) did not provide data for analysis, but median serum 25(OH)D levels
  were reported to be lower in the low-dose group at both six and 12 weeks. At 12
  weeks the median serum parathyroid hormone level was lower in the high-dose group.
  AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We included three RCTs of varying quality. We consider that
  the current evidence presented in this review is not of sufficient quality to guide
  clinical practice. Until further evidence becomes available, clinicians should consider
  the relevant existing guidelines for vitamin D supplementation and dietary reference
  intakes for calcium and vitamin D. Well-designed RCTs of parallel design, are required
  to determine the effects and the safety of vitamin D supplementation as well as
  to assess the relative benefits of different doses in children and adults with SCD."
