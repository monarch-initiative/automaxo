input_text: Comorbidities are risk factors for hospitalization and serious COVID-19
  illness in children and adults with sickle cell disease.Patients with sickle cell
  disease (SCD) are at high risk of developing serious infections, therefore, understanding
  the impact that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection has on
  this population is important. We sought to identify factors associated with hospitalization
  and serious COVID-19 illness in children and adults with SCD.We established the
  international SECURE-SCD Registry to collect data on patients with SCD and COVID-19
  illness. We used multivariable logistic models to estimate the independent effects
  of age, sex, genotype, hydroxyurea, and SCD-related and -nonrelated comorbidities
  on hospitalization, serious COVID-19 illness, and pain as a presenting symptom during
  COVID-19 illness. As of 23 March 2021, 750 COVID-19 illness cases in patients with
  SCD were reported to the registry. We identified history of pain (relative risk
  [RR], 2.15; P < .0001) and SCD heart/lung comorbidities (RR, 1.61; P = .0001) as
  risk factors for hospitalization in children. History of pain (RR, 1.78; P = .002)
  was also a risk factor for hospitalization in adults. Children with history of pain
  (RR, 3.09; P = .009), SCD heart/lung comorbidities (RR, 1.76; P = .03), and SCD
  renal comorbidities (RR, 3.67; P < .0001) and adults with history of pain (RR 1.94,
  P = .02) were at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness. History of
  pain and SCD renal comorbidities also increased risk of pain during COVID-19 in
  children; history of pain, SCD heart/lung comorbidities, and female sex increased
  risk of pain during COVID-19 in adults. Hydroxyurea showed no effect on hospitalization
  and COVID-19 severity, but it lowered the risk of presenting with pain in adults
  during COVID-19.
