input_text: 'Extended phenotyping does not preclude the occurrence of delayed haemolytic
  transfusion reactions in sickle cell disease. Delayed haemolytic transfusion reaction
  (DHTR) is a potentially life-threatening complication of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions
  in sickle cell disease (SCD) and is classically induced by reactivation of previously
  formed antibodies. Improved antigenic matching has reduced alloimmunization and
  may reduce DHTR risk. We conducted a retrospective cohort study to investigate the
  incidence rate of DHTR in SCD patients receiving extended matched units (ABO/RhDCcEe/K/Fya
  /Jkb /S). Occasional transfusion episodes (OTE) between 2011 and 2020 were reviewed
  for occurrence of DHTR symptoms using four screening criteria: decreased Hb, increased
  lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), pain, and dark urine. We included 205 patients who
  received a cumulative number of 580 transfusion episodes of 1866 RBC units. During
  follow-up, 10 DHTR events were observed. The incidence rate of DHTR was 13 8/1000
  OTEs [95% confidence interval (CI): 7 37-22 2], with a cumulative incidence of 15
  2% (95% CI: 8 4-24 0%) after 25 patients having received RBC units. One DHTR event
  was fatal (10%). Symptoms were misdiagnosed in four DHTR events (40%) as other acute
  SCD complications. Despite a lower incidence rate compared to most other studies,
  the incidence rate of DHTR in SCD remains high, in spite of extended matching of
  donor RBCs. Increased awareness of DHTR is of utmost importance to facilitate early
  diagnosis and, consequently, improve outcome.'
