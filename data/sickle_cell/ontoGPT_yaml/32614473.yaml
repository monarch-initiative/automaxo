input_text: "Preoperative blood transfusions for sickle cell disease. BACKGROUND:
  Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the commonest severe monogenic disorders in
  the world, due to the inheritance of two abnormal haemoglobin (beta globin) genes.
  SCD can cause severe pain, significant end-organ damage, pulmonary complications,
  and premature death. Surgical interventions are more common in people with SCD,
  and occur at much younger ages than in the general population. Blood transfusions
  are frequently used prior to surgery and several regimens are used but there is
  no consensus over the best method or the necessity of transfusion in specific surgical
  cases. This is an update of a Cochrane Review. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether
  there is evidence that preoperative blood transfusion in people with SCD undergoing
  elective or emergency surgery reduces mortality and perioperative or sickle cell-related
  serious adverse events. To compare the effectiveness of different transfusion regimens
  (aggressive or conservative) if preoperative transfusions are indicated in people
  with SCD. SEARCH METHODS: We searched for relevant trials in the Cochrane Library,
  MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the Transfusion Evidence Library (from
  1980), and ongoing trial databases; all searches current to 28 January 2020 We searched
  the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register: 19 September
  2019. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised
  controlled trials comparing preoperative blood transfusion regimens to different
  regimens or no transfusion in people with SCD undergoing elective or emergency surgery.
  There was no restriction by outcomes examined, language or publication status. DATA
  COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility and
  the risk of bias and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: Three trials with 990 participants
  were eligible for inclusion in the review. There were no ongoing trials identified.
  These trials were conducted between 1988 and 2011. The majority of people included
  had haemoglobin (Hb) SS SCD. The majority of surgical procedures were considered
  low or intermediate risk for developing sickle cell-related complications. Aggressive
  versus simple red blood cell transfusions One trial (551 participants) compared
  an aggressive transfusion regimen (decreasing sickle haemoglobin to less than 30%)
  to a simple transfusion regimen (increasing haemoglobin to 100 g/L). This trial
  re-randomised participants and therefore quantitative analysis was only possible
  on two subsets of data: participants undergoing cholecystectomy (230 participants);
  and participants undergoing tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy surgeries (107 participants).
  Data were not combined as we do not know if any participant received both surgeries.
  Overall, the quality of the evidence was very low across different outcomes according
  to GRADE methodology. This was due to the trial being at high risk of bias primarily
  due to lack of blinding, indirectness and the outcome estimates being imprecise.
  Cholecystectomy subgroup results are reported in the abstract. Results for both
  subgroups were similar. There was no difference in all-cause mortality between people
  receiving aggressive transfusions and those receiving conservative transfusions.
  No deaths occurred in either subgroup. There were no differences between the aggressive
  transfusion group and conservative transfusion group in the number of people developing:\
  \   an acute chest syndrome, risk ratio (RR) 0.84 (95% confidence interval (CI)
  0.38 to 1.84) (one trial, 230 participants, very low-quality evidence);   vaso-occlusive
  crisis, risk ratio 0.30 (95% CI 0.09 to 1.04) (one trial, 230 participants, very
  low quality evidence);   serious infection, risk ratio 1.75 (95% CI 0.59 to 5.18)
  (one trial, 230 participants, very low-quality evidence);   any perioperative complications,
  RR 0.75 (95% CI 0.36 to 1.55) (one trial, 230 participants, very low-quality evidence);\
  \   a transfusion-related complication, RR 1.85 (95% CI 0.89 to 3.88) (one trial,
  230 participants, very low-quality evidence). Preoperative transfusion versus no
  preoperative transfusion Two trials (434 participants) compared a preoperative transfusion
  plus standard care to a group receiving standard care. Overall, the quality of the
  evidence was low to very low across different outcomes according to GRADE methodology.
  This was due to the trials being at high risk of bias due to lack of blinding, and
  outcome estimates being imprecise. One trial was stopped early because more people
  in the no transfusion arm developed an acute chest syndrome. There was no difference
  in all-cause mortality between people receiving preoperative transfusions and those
  receiving no preoperative transfusions (two trials, 434 participants, no deaths
  occurred). There was significant heterogeneity between the two trials in the number
  of people developing an acute chest syndrome, a meta-analysis was therefore not
  performed. One trial showed a reduced number of people developing acute chest syndrome
  between people receiving preoperative transfusions and those receiving no preoperative
  transfusions, risk ratio 0.11 (95% confidence interval 0.01 to 0.80) (65 participants),
  whereas the other trial did not, RR 4.81 (95% CI 0.23 to 99.61) (369 participants).
  There were no differences between the preoperative transfusion groups and the groups
  without preoperative transfusion in the number of people developing:   a vaso-occlusive
  crisis, Peto odds ratio (OR) 1.91 (95% confidence interval 0.61 to 6.04) (two trials,
  434 participants, very low-quality evidence).   a serious infection, Peto OR 1.29
  (95% CI 0.29 to 5.71) (two trials, 434 participants, very low-quality evidence);\
  \   any perioperative complications, RR 0.24 (95% CI 0.03 to 2.05) (one trial, 65
  participants, low-quality evidence). There was an increase in the number of people
  developing circulatory overload in those receiving preoperative transfusions compared
  to those not receiving preoperative transfusions in one of the two trials, and no
  events were seen in the other trial (no meta-analysis performed). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS:
  There is insufficient evidence from randomised trials to determine whether conservative
  preoperative blood transfusion is as effective as aggressive preoperative blood
  transfusion in preventing sickle-related or surgery-related complications in people
  with HbSS disease. There is very low quality evidence that preoperative blood transfusion
  may prevent development of acute chest syndrome. Due to lack of evidence this review
  cannot comment on management for people with HbSC or HbSbeta+ disease or for those
  with high baseline haemoglobin concentrations."
