input_text: 'Underweight risk factors in older children with sickle cell anemia: a
  comparison of low- to high-income countries.Previously, we demonstrated that older
  children with sickle cell anemia (SCA) living in a low-income setting are at increased
  risk of death if they are underweight (weight-for-age z-score <-1). We now conducted
  a cross-sectional study in both low- and high-income settings to determine the consistent
  biological risk factors for being underweight across both low- and high-income settings
  for children aged 5-12 years old with SCA. The children from low- and high-income
  settings were eligible participants for the Primary Prevention of Stroke in Children
  with Sickle Cell Disease in Nigeria (SPRING, n=928) and the Silent Cerebral Infarct
  (SIT, North America/Europe, n=1,093) trials, respectively. The median age in the
  SPRING and SIT cohorts was 8.1 (IQR 6.3-10.3) and 8.5 (6.8-10.6) years, respectively
  (p=<0.001), and approximately half were male (49.0% and 50.8%, respectively, p=0.434).
  A total of 87.9% (n=816) of participants in SPRING (low-income) met the study criteria
  for underweight (weight-for-age z-score <-1) and 22.7% (n=211) for severely underweight
  (weight-for-age z-score <-3), significantly higher than the SIT (high-income) cohort
  at 25.7% (n=281) underweight and 0.7% (n=8) severely underweight (p<0.001 for both
  comparisons). In the combined cohort, older age (OR 1.24, p<0.001, 95% CI 1.17-1.31)
  and lower hemoglobin level (OR 0.67, p<0.001, 95% CI 0.60-0.75) were associated
  with being underweight. Age and hemoglobin level remained statistically significant
  in separate models for the SPRING and SIT cohorts. Older age and lower hemoglobin
  levels in children aged 5-12 with SCA are associated with increased odds of being
  underweight in both low- and high-income settings.'
