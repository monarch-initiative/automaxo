input_text: 'Long-term outcomes of lentiviral gene therapy for the beta-hemoglobinopathies:
  the HGB-205 trial.Sickle cell disease (SCD) and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia
  (TDT) are the most prevalent monogenic disorders worldwide. Trial HGB-205 ( NCT02151526
  ) aimed at evaluating gene therapy by autologous CD34+ cells transduced ex vivo
  with lentiviral vector BB305 that encodes the anti-sickling betaA-T87Q-globin expressed
  in the erythroid lineage. HGB-205 is a phase 1/2, open-label, single-arm, non-randomized
  interventional study of 2-year duration at a single center, followed by observation
  in long-term follow-up studies LTF-303 ( NCT02633943 ) and LTF-307 ( NCT04628585
  ) for TDT and SCD, respectively. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were similar to
  those for allogeneic transplantation but restricted to patients lacking geno-identical,
  histocompatible donors. Four patients with TDT and three patients with SCD, ages
  13-21 years, were treated after busulfan myeloablation 4.6-7.9 years ago, with a
  median follow-up of 4.5 years. Key primary endpoints included mortality, engraftment,
  replication-competent lentivirus and clonal dominance. No adverse events related
  to the drug product were observed. Clinical remission and remediation of biological
  hallmarks of the disease have been sustained in two of the three patients with SCD,
  and frequency of transfusions was reduced in the third. The patients with TDT are
  all transfusion free with improvement of dyserythropoiesis and iron overload.'
