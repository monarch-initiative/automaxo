input_text: 'Characterizing User Engagement With a Digital Intervention for Pain Self-management
  Among Youth With Sickle Cell Disease and Their Caregivers: Subanalysis of a Randomized
  Controlled Trial. BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is characterized by severe
  acute pain episodes as well as risk for chronic pain. Digital delivery of SCD pain
  self-management support may enhance pain self-management skills and accessibility
  for youth. However, little is known about how youth with SCD and their caregivers
  engage with digital health programs. iCanCope with pain is a digital pain self-management
  platform adapted for youth with SCD and caregivers through a user-centered design
  approach. The program was delivered via a website (separate versions for youth and
  caregiver) and mobile app (youth only). OBJECTIVE: We aimed to characterize patterns
  of user engagement with the iCanCope with SCD program among youth with SCD and their
  caregivers. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was completed across multiple
  North American SCD clinics. Eligible youth were aged 12-18 years, diagnosed with
  SCD, English-speaking, and experiencing moderate-to-severe pain interference. Eligible
  caregivers were English-speaking with a child enrolled in the study. Dyads were
  randomized to receive the iCanCope intervention or attention-control education for
  8-12 weeks. This report focused on engagement among dyads who received the intervention.
  User-level analytics were captured. Individual interviews were conducted with 20%
  of dyads. Descriptive statistics characterized quantitative engagement. Content
  analysis summarized qualitative interview data. Exploratory analysis tested the
  hypothesis that caregiver engagement would be positively associated with child engagement.
  RESULTS: The cohort included primarily female (60% [34/57] of youth; 91% [49/56]
  of caregivers) and Black (>90% of youth [53/57] and caregivers [50/56]) participants.
  Among 56 dyads given program access, differential usage patterns were observed:
  both the youth and caregiver engaged (16/56, 29%), only the youth engaged (24/56,
  43%), only the caregiver engaged (1/56, 2%), and neither individual engaged (16/56,
  29%). While most youth engaged with the program (40/57, 70%), most caregivers did
  not (39/56, 70%). Youth were more likely to engage with the app than the website
  (85% [34/57] versus 68% [23/57]), and the most popular content categories were goal
  setting, program introduction, and symptom history. Among caregivers, program introduction,
  behavioral plans, and goal setting were the most popular content areas. As hypothesized,
  there was a moderate positive association between caregiver and child engagement
  (chi21=6.6; P=.01; phi=0.34). Interviews revealed that most dyads would continue
  to use the program (11/12, 92%) and recommend it to others (10/12, 83%). The reasons
  for app versus website preference among youth were ease of use, acceptable time
  commitment, and interactivity. Barriers to caregiver engagement included high time
  burden and limited perceived relevance of content. CONCLUSIONS: This is one of the
  first studies to apply digital health analytics to characterize patterns of engagement
  with SCD self-management among youth and caregivers. The findings will be used to
  optimize the iCanCope with SCD program prior to release. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov
  NCT03201874; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03201874.'
