input_text: "Gene Therapy for beta-Hemoglobinopathies: From Discovery to Clinical
  Trials. Investigations to understand the function and control of the globin genes
  have led to some of the most exciting molecular discoveries and biomedical breakthroughs
  of the 20th and 21st centuries. Extensive characterization of the globin gene locus,
  accompanied by pioneering work on the utilization of viruses as human gene delivery
  tools in human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HPSCs), has led to transformative
  and successful therapies via autologous hematopoietic stem-cell transplant with
  gene therapy (HSCT-GT). Due to the advanced understanding of the beta-globin gene
  cluster, the first diseases considered for autologous HSCT-GT were two prevalent
  beta-hemoglobinopathies: sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia, both affecting
  functional beta-globin chains and leading to substantial morbidity. Both conditions
  are suitable for allogeneic HSCT; however, this therapy comes with serious risks
  and is most effective using an HLA-matched family donor (which is not available
  for most patients) to obtain optimal therapeutic and safe benefits. Transplants
  from unrelated or haplo-identical donors carry higher risks, although they are progressively
  improving. Conversely, HSCT-GT utilizes the patient's own HSPCs, broadening access
  to more patients. Several gene therapy clinical trials have been reported to have
  achieved significant disease improvement, and more are underway. Based on the safety
  and the therapeutic success of autologous HSCT-GT, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
  (FDA) in 2022 approved an HSCT-GT for beta-thalassemia (Zynteglo ). This review
  illuminates the beta-globin gene research journey, adversities faced, and achievements
  reached; it highlights important molecular and genetic findings of the beta-globin
  locus, describes the predominant globin vectors, and concludes by describing promising
  results from clinical trials for both sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia."
