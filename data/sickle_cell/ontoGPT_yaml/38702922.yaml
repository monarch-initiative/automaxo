input_text: 'Immunization adherence among children with sickle cell disease and sickle
  cell trait: Results of a population-based study. INTRODUCTION: Despite the importance
  of timely vaccine completion for protection from infectious disease, there is limited
  knowledge of the immunization adherence rates of children with sickle cell disease
  (SCD). METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study comparing the immunization
  rates of children with SCD to those with sickle cell trait between 2008 and 2019
  in Georgia. Completion rates for each vaccine and the proportion of children with
  up-to-date status at 24 and 35 months were calculated and compared between the cohorts.
  Chi-square tests with odds ratios (OR) for differences and 95% confidence intervals
  (CIs) were reported on the overall up-to-date rates and rates for individual vaccines
  at 24 and 35 months for the two cohorts. RESULTS: Children with SCD had higher up-to-date
  rates than children with sickle cell trait at 24 and 35 months. At 35 months, the
  overall up-to-date rates (OR = 1.17; 95% CI, 1.04-1.31; p = .004) and the four-dose
  pneumococcal conjugate vaccine series (OR = 1.36; 95% CI, 1.18-1.57; p < .001) were
  significantly different between the groups. Both cohorts had the highest completion
  rates for the hepatitis B series and the lowest rates for the varicella vaccine.
  Doses of diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis vaccine; varicella; and pneumococcal
  conjugate vaccines were most commonly missed by children in both cohorts. CONCLUSIONS:
  Children with SCD have better immunization coverage than children with sickle cell
  trait, but there is an opportunity for improvement. Policymakers and healthcare
  professionals should focus on increasing access to care coordination services among
  children with SCD to ensure on-time and preventive healthcare services.'
