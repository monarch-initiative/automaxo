input_text: "Management of a patient with sickle cell disease and multiple red blood
  cell alloantibodies in preparation for a hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.BACKGROUND:
  Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is currently the only widely available
  curative option for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Alloimmunization in
  this population is frequent and can complicate transfusion management during the
  HSCT period. The case of a pediatric patient with severe SCD clinical phenotype,
  multiple alloantibodies (9), and hyperhemolysis syndrome who underwent haploidentical
  HSCT is described. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The patient was known for an anti-e,
  despite RHCE*01.01 allele, which predicts a C- c+ E- weak e+ phenotype. Donors matching
  the patient's extended phenotype were targeted for RHCE genotyping. RESULTS: Donors
  homozygotes or heterozygotes for RHCE*01.01 were selected for compatibility analyses
  and ranked based on strength of reactions. Discordance between zygosity and strength
  of reactions was observed, as the most compatible donors were heterozygotes for
  RHCE*01.01. In total, the patient received seven RBC units from two different donors
  during HSCT process without transfusion reaction or development of new alloantibodies.
  Six months post-HSCT, his hemoglobin level is stable at around 120 g/L and his chimerism
  is 100%. DISCUSSION: This case highlights the complexity of transfusion management
  during HSCT of alloimmunized patients with SCD. Collecting sufficient compatible
  units requires early involvement of transfusion medicine teams and close communication
  with the local blood provider. Genotyping of donors self-identifying as Black is
  useful for identifying compatible blood for those patients but has some limitations.
  HSCT for heavily alloimmunized patients is feasible and safe with early involvement
  of transfusion medicine specialists. Further research on the clinical impact of
  genotypic matching is needed."
