input_text: 'Testicular Tissue Banking for Fertility Preservation in Young Boys: Which
  Patients Should Be Included? Due to the growing number of young patients at risk
  of germ cell loss, there is a need to preserve spermatogonial stem cells for patients
  who are not able to bank spermatozoa. Worldwide, more and more clinics are implementing
  testicular tissue (TT) banking programs, making it a novel, yet indispensable, discipline
  in the field of fertility preservation. Previously, TT cryopreservation was predominantly
  offered to young cancer patients before starting gonadotoxic chemo- or radiotherapy.
  Nowadays, most centers also bank TT from patients with non-malignant conditions
  who need gonadotoxic conditioning therapy prior to hematopoietic stem cell (HSCT)
  or bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Additionally, some centers include patients
  who suffer from genetic or developmental disorders associated with prepubertal germ
  cell loss or patients who already had a previous round of chemo- or radiotherapy.
  It is important to note that the surgical removal of TT is an invasive procedure.
  Moreover, TT cryopreservation is still considered experimental as restoration methods
  are not yet clinically available. For this reason, TT banking should preferably
  only be offered to patients who are at significant risk of becoming infertile. In
  our view, TT cryopreservation is recommended for young cancer patients in need of
  high-risk chemo- and/or radiotherapy, regardless of previous low-risk treatment.
  Likewise, TT banking is advised for patients with non-malignant disorders such as
  sickle cell disease, beta-thalassemia, and bone marrow failure, who need high-risk
  conditioning therapy before HSCT/BMT. TT retrieval during orchidopexy is also proposed
  for patients with bilateral cryptorchidism. Since patients with a medium- to low-risk
  treatment generally maintain their fertility, TT banking is not advised for this
  group. Also for Klinefelter patients, TT banking is not recommended as it does not
  give better outcomes than a testicular sperm extraction later in life.'
