input_text: 'Perinatal outcomes in women with sickle cell disease: a matched cohort
  study from London, UK. There are limited data on contemporary outcomes for women
  with sickle cell disease (SCD) in pregnancy. We conducted a single-site matched
  cohort study, comparing 131 pregnancies to women with SCD between 2007 and 2017
  to a comparison group of 1310 pregnancies unaffected by SCD. Restricting our analysis
  to singleton pregnancies that reached 24 weeks of gestation, we used conditional
  Poisson regression to estimate adjusted risk ratios (aRRs) for perinatal outcomes.
  Infants born to mothers with SCD were more likely to be small for gestational age
  [aRR 1 69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1 13-2 48], preterm (aRR 2 62, 95% CI 1
  82-3 78) and require Neonatal Unit (NNU) admission (aRR 3 59, 95% CI 2 18-5 90).
  Pregnant women with SCD were at higher risk of pre-eclampsia/eclampsia (aRR 3 53,
  95% CI 2 00-6 24), more likely to receive induction of labour (aRR 2 50, 95% CI
  1 82-1 76) and caesarean birth (aRR 1 44, 95% CI 1 18-1 76). In analysis stratified
  by genotype, the risk of adverse outcomes was highest in haemoglobin SS (HbSS) pregnancies
  (n = 80). There was no strong evidence that haemoglobin SC (HbSC) pregnancies (n
  = 46) were at higher risk of preterm birth, caesarean delivery, or NNU admission.
  Pre-eclampsia/eclampsia was more frequently observed in HbSC pregnancies. Despite
  improvements in the care of pregnant women with SCD, the increased risk of adverse
  perinatal outcomes remains.'
