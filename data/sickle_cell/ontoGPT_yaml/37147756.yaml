input_text: 'Mechanism underlying Fanmugua () leaf multicomponent synergistic therapy
  for anemia: data mining based on hematopoietic network. OBJECTIVE: To investigate
  the underlying mechanism of Fanmugua (Fructus Caricae) Leaf (CPL) multicomponent
  synergistic therapy for anemia. METHODS: The components were identified in the literature.
  Six databases were searched for targets of CPL. Enrichment analysis was used to
  determine the targets associated with anemia and in bone marrow. Based on the Kyoto
  Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database, pathways and targets related to hematopoiesis
  were obtained. The key targets were obtained by protein-protein interaction analysis.
  Molecular docking was used to analyze the binding ability of key targets and active
  components. Bone marrow cells were used as an experimental model to verify the drug
  efficacy. RESULTS: A total of 139 components and 1868 targets of CPL were retrieved
  from the literature. By disease enrichment analysis, 543 targets for hemorrhagic
  anemia, 223 targets for aplastic anemia, and 126 targets for sickle cell anemia
  were obtained. Target organ enrichment yielded 27, 29, and 20 targets of bone marrow.
  Based on KEGG pathway enrichment, a total of 47 shared hematopoietic pathways and
  42 related targets were found. The key targets were vascular endothelial growth
  factor A (VEGFA), interleukin 10 (IL-10), platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1
  (PECAM1), C-C motif chemokine 2 (CCL2), and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1).
  The CPL active components included ursolic acid, quercetin, and hesperidin. The
  expression of VEGFA was significantly increased after CPL treatment. Quercetin and
  ursolic acid acted on VEGFA. Quercetin and Hesperidin acted on VCAM1. Quercetin
  acted on IL-10, CCL2, VCAM1, and VEGFA. Cell experiments revealed that CPL could
  promote the proliferation and migration of bone marrow cells. CONCLUSIONS: CPL has
  the synergistic efficacy of treating anemia through multiple components, targets,
  and pathways.'
