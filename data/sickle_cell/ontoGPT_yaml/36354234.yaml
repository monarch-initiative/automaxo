input_text: Safety of coronavirus disease 2019 vaccines in 213 adult patients with
  sickle cell disease.Given the lack of information about safety of the COVID-19 vaccines
  for sickle cell disease (SCD) patients, we sought to determine whether COVID-19
  vaccine was associated with subsequent hospital admission for vaso-occlusive events
  (VOEs). We included 402 patients with SCD, including 88 regularly transfused. As
  of July 31, 2021, 213 (53.0%) of them had received a least one dose of COVID vaccine
  (Pfizer 93.0%). We showed similar risk of hospital admission for a VOE among vaccinated
  patients (whether transfused or not) and among a control group of non-vaccinated
  patients matched for age, sex and genotype.
