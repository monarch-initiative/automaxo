input_text: 'Managing sickle cell disease and related complications in pregnancy:
  results of an international Delphi panel.Data to guide evidence-based management
  of pregnant people with sickle cell disease (SCD) is limited. This international
  Delphi panel aimed to identify consensus among multidisciplinary experts for SCD
  management during pregnancy. The two-round Delphi process used questionnaires exploring
  seven topics (antenatal care, hydroxyurea use, transfusion, prevention of complications,
  treatment of complications, delivery and follow-up, and bottlenecks and knowledge
  gaps) developed by a steering committee. Thirteen panelists (hematologists, physiologists,
  obstetricians, maternal fetal medicine and transfusion medicine physicians) from
  the US, the UK, Turkey and France completed the first survey; 12 panelists completed
  the second round. Anonymized responses were collected and summarized by a contract
  research organization (Akkodis Belgium). Consensus/strong consensus was predefined
  as 75%-90% (9-10/12)/>90% ( 11/12) of panelists agreeing or disagreeing on a response
  to a predefined clinical scenario or statement. In several areas of SCD management,
  consensus was achieved: experts recommended performing at least monthly multidisciplinary
  antenatal follow-up, administering prophylactic aspirin for preeclampsia prevention
  between gestational weeks 12-36, initiating prophylactic transfusion therapy in
  certain cases, or choosing automated red blood cell exchange over other transfusion
  methods in patients with iron overload or severe acute chest syndrome. No consensus
  was reached on several topics including the prophylactic aspirin dose, indications
  for starting infection prophylaxis, routine use of prophylactic transfusions, or
  use of prophylactic transfusions for preventing fetal complications. These recommendations
  could inform clinical care for pregnant SCD patients in the absence of large clinical
  trials involving this population; the identified knowledge gaps can orient future
  research.'
