input_text: 'Managing sickle cell disease and related complications in pregnancy:
  results of an international Delphi panel. ABSTRACT: Data to guide evidence-based
  management of pregnant people with sickle cell disease (SCD) are limited. This international
  Delphi panel aimed to identify consensus among multidisciplinary experts for SCD
  management during pregnancy. The 2-round Delphi process used questionnaires exploring
  7 topics (antenatal care, hydroxyurea use, transfusion, prevention of complications,
  treatment of complications, delivery and follow-up, and bottlenecks and knowledge
  gaps) developed by a steering committee. Thirteen panelists (hematologists, physiologists,
  obstetricians, maternal fetal medicine, and transfusion medicine physicians) from
  the United States, the United Kingdom, Turkey, and France completed the first survey;
  12 panelists completed the second round. Anonymized responses were collected and
  summarized by a contract research organization (Akkodis Belgium). Consensus and
  strong consensus were predefined as 75% to 90% (9-10 of 12) and >90% (>=11 of 12)
  of panelists, respectively, agreeing or disagreeing on a response to a predefined
  clinical scenario or statement. In several areas of SCD management, consensus was
  achieved: experts recommended performing at least monthly multidisciplinary antenatal
  follow-up, administering prophylactic aspirin for preeclampsia prevention between
  gestational weeks 12 and 36, initiating prophylactic transfusion therapy in certain
  cases, or choosing automated red blood cell exchange over other transfusion methods
  for patients with iron overload or severe acute chest syndrome. No consensus was
  reached on several topics including the prophylactic aspirin dose, indications for
  starting infection prophylaxis, routine use of prophylactic transfusions, or use
  of prophylactic transfusions for preventing fetal complications. These recommendations
  could inform clinical care for patients with SCD who are pregnant in the absence
  of large clinical trials involving this population; the identified knowledge gaps
  can orient future research.'
