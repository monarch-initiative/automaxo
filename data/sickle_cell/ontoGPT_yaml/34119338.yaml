input_text: "Women with sickle cell disease report low knowledge and use of long acting
  reversible contraception.BACKGROUND: High rates of unplanned pregnancy and low rates
  of contraception use are reported among women with sickle cell disease (SCD). Pregnancy
  in women with SCD is high risk and unintended pregnancies limit opportunities to
  provide indicated preconception care and counseling. Contraceptive use in women
  with SCD is complicated by a lack of disease-specific data about treatment risks
  and benefits. The purpose of this study was to describe, for the first time in the
  U.S. context, contraceptive use, knowledge and preferences in adult cohort of women
  with SCD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A single-center survey study of women with SCD
  of reproductive age from our Center's adult and pediatric sickle cell centers. RESULTS:
  Seventy-eight women ages 28-65 years (median 33.5 years, IQR 16) completed surveys.
  Seventy-three percent of respondents had an average of 2.5 pregnancies (S.D. 1.22)
  and of these, 58% reported being pregnant when they did not want to be pregnant
  at least once. The most common forms of contraception used were condoms (87%), birth
  control pills (46%), medroxyprogesterone (44%) and withdrawal (44%). Twenty-two
  percent of subjects reported using a long-acting reversible form of contraception
  and 21% reported a tubal ligation or partner vasectomy. Respondents demonstrated
  low knowledge of the efficacy of contraceptive options and over-estimated the risk
  of pregnancy with the IUD, implant. Contraceptive priorities included pregnancy
  prevention, decreasing HIV transmission and effects on SCD symptoms. CONCLUSIONS:
  Women with SCD have high rates of unintended pregnancy, low knowledge of contraceptive
  efficacy and low use of long-acting reversible contraception."
