input_text: 'Enrollment Lessons from a Biological Assignment Study of Marrow Transplantation
  versus Standard Care for Adolescents and Young Adults with Sickle Cell Disease:
  Considerations for Future Gene and Cellular Therapy Trials.We previously conducted
  a single-arm feasibility study (STRIDE1) of myeloablative bone marrow transplantation
  (BMT) in adolescents and young adults with sickle cell disease (SCD). The trial
  identified donors before entry, enrolled well, and found no unexpected regimen-related
  toxicity. Although many single-arm studies have been published, there are no controlled
  trials of either BMT or gene therapy in SCD. Therefore, we designed a comparative
  trial by biological assignment (available donor versus no donor). This multicenter
  National Institutes of Health-funded study (Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical
  Trials Network 1503; STRIDE2) enrolled patients between 2016 and 2021 at 35 sites.
  Lagging recruitment led to study closure, and here we report the impediments to
  accrual. The BMT regimen and entry criteria were from STRIDE1, and 2-year survival
  was the primary endpoint. To minimize selection bias from prior HLA typing, STRIDE2
  excluded individuals with previously identified donors. Accrual was stopped at 69%
  of target (138 enrolled; assigned 28 with donor, 96 with no donor). Barriers to
  enrollment included lower than expected frequency of HLA-matched related and unrelated
  donors; loss of enrollees owing to previously identified donors; conventional care
  arm dissuading some seeking BMT; challenging short-term endpoints in SCD, including
  incomplete documentation of sickle pain episodes; state Medicaid (primary insurers
  of SCD) denial of BMT coverage for adult SCD despite the study having secured Coverage
  with Evidence Development from the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services; slowed
  accrual in 2019 to 2021 during the Coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic; and restriction
  of BMT resourcing for nonmalignant diseases by academic medical (cancer) centers.
  Social obstacles and access to BMT centers also limited entry, as did practitioner
  and participant concerns over suitability, cost, and toxicity. Planning for future
  controlled trials of curative therapy in SCD and other nonmalignant diseases likely
  will meet these enrollment challenges. Lessons from this trial may aid the development
  of future comparative studies.'
