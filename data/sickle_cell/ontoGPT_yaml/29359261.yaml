input_text: "Transplantation in patients with iron overload: is there a place for
  magnetic resonance imaging? : Transplantation in iron overload. In iron overload
  diseases (thalassemia, sickle cell, and myelodysplastic syndrome), iron is deposited
  in all internal organs, leading to functional abnormalities. Hematopoietic stem
  cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only treatment offering a potential cure in these
  diseases. Our aim was to describe the experience in the field and the role of magnetic
  resonance imaging in the evaluation of iron overload before and after HSCT. Magnetic
  resonance imaging (MRI), using T2*, is the most commonly used tool to diagnose myocardial-liver
  iron overload and guide tailored treatment. Currently, HSCT offers complete cure
  in thalassemia major, after overcoming the immunologic barrier, and should be considered
  for all patients who have a suitable donor. The overall thalassemia-free survival
  of low-risk, HLA-matched sibling stem cell transplantation patients is 85-90%, with
  a 95% overall survival. The problems of rejection and engraftment are improving
  with the use of adequate immunosuppression. However, a detailed iron assessment
  of both heart and liver is necessary for pre- and post-transplant evaluation. In
  iron overload diseases, heart and liver iron evaluation is indispensable not only
  for the patients' survival, but also for evaluation before and after HSCT."
