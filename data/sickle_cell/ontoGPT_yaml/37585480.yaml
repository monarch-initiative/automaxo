input_text: 'Comparison of Thromboembolism Outcomes in Patients with Sickle Cell Disease
  Prescribed Hormonal Contraception.Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) are at
  risk of thromboembolism (TE) and use of hormonal contraception can further increase
  that risk. This study aims to assess patterns of hormonal contraceptive use and
  compare risk of contraception-related TE between combined hormonal contraceptives
  (CHC) and progestin-only contraceptives (POC). Patients with SCD between 12-44 years
  with a new prescription of a hormonal contraceptive in the CMS MAX database (2006-2018)
  were followed for one year. Cox regression analysis was used to calculate the hazard
  ratio (HR) of TE. We identified 7,173 new users: 44.6% initiated CHC and 55.4% initiated
  POC. Combined oral contraceptive pills (OCP) (36.5%) and progestin-only depot medroxyprogesterone
  acetate (33.9%) were the most frequently prescribed agents. A total of 1.8% of contraception
  users had a new diagnosis of TE within one year of first identified contraception
  prescription. There were no significant differences in TE event rates between CHC
  and POC users (17.2 and 24.7 events per 1000 person-years respectively, adjusted
  HR=0.83, 95% CI: 0.58-1.21; p-value=0.336). In patients prescribed OCP, there were
  no differences in TE event rates based on estrogen dose or progestin generation.
  Transdermal patch had 2.4 fold increased risk of TE as compared to OCP. Although
  limited by the retrospective study design and use of administrative claims data,
  this study found no significant differences in TE rates between new users of CHC
  and POC in patients with SCD. Careful evaluation of underlying TE risk factors should
  be considered in each patient with SCD prior to initiation of hormonal contraception.'
