input_text: '[Epidemiological and clinical profile of children with Coronavirus disease
  (COVID-19) at the Center for the Treatment of Epidemics and Infection Prevention
  (CTEIP) of the University Hospital of Donka in Conakry]. COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2
  virus, which is genetically similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)
  virus. In pediatrics, it has a benign clinical course. Since the outbreak of COVID-19
  pandemic in Guinea, whose epicenter was Conakry, pediatric cases have been reported
  at the CTEIP in Donka. The purpose of this study was to determine their epidemiological
  profile. We conducted a descriptive cross-sectional study of children aged 0-16
  years admitted to the CTEIP, Donka, over a period of four months. Out of 7308 patients,
  coming predominantly from 5 communes of Conakry and hospitalized in the CTEPI, 189
  were aged between 0 and 16 years (2 .59%). The majority of patients were within
  the age-group 0-4-years (38.62%) with a sex-ratio (F/M) of 1.52; 62.96% were students,
  70% of children lived in Conakry, 28.57% of mothers were traders and contact persons
  (39.68%); 37.57% of fathers were civil servants, 2.65% of children had a history
  of sickle cell disease and 1.59% had allergic rhinitis. Asymptomatic patients accounted
  for 52.38% of cases and diagnosed patients were 74.6%. Symptoms included fever,
  rhinorrhea, headache, cough, abdominal pain, sneezing, diarrhea, physical asthenia.
  The incidence of COVID-19 among children hospitalized in the CTEIP of Donka is low.
  Children aged 5 years and older are more affected and nearly 50% are asymptomatic.
  Common symptoms are fever, headache, rhinorrhea, cough, abdominal pain, sneezing,
  diarrhea, physical asthenia.'
