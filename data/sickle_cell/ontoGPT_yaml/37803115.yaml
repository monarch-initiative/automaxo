input_text: 'New Insights into Clinical Management for Sickle Cell Disease: Uncovering
  the Significant Pathways Affected by the Involvement of Sickle Cell Disease.One
  of the severe monogenic conditions with the highest prevalence in the globe is sickle
  cell disease. Although the significance of chronic anemia, hemolysis, and vasculopathy
  has been established, hemoglobin polymerization, which results in erythrocyte stiffness
  and Vaso-occlusion, is important to the pathophysiology of this disease. Clinical
  management is elementary, and there is scant reliable data for many treatments.
  The onset of cerebrovascular illness and cognitive impairment are two of the major
  issues associated with sickle cell disease in children, and it is only now that
  researchers are beginning to understand how blood transfusions and hydroxycarbamide
  can prevent these complications. When Vaso occlusion and inflammation occur repeatedly,
  the majority of organs are gradually damaged, including the brain, kidneys, lungs,
  bones, and cardiovascular system. This damage worsens with age. In our study, we
  focused on the specific pathways which are affected by the involvement of effected
  genes. Firstly, we retrieved the gene datasets from the publically available data
  source website DisGNET. Using literature-based genes, we identified 290 highly regulated
  genes that are directly associated with sickle cell disease. We subsequently performed
  a gene expression analysis and extracted a gene set using GEO2R analysis, which
  was then used to prune 290 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). After pruning
  we got 60 highly expressed genes. After identification of DEGs, we used these genes
  for pathway analysis. For the pathway analysis, we used Reactome software and we
  found that these DEGs are directly associated with 7 different pathways, which are
  alpha beta signaling pathways, 15 antiviral mechanism, Oligoadenylate synthetase
  (OAS) antiviral response, interleukin 1 signaling pathways, interleukin 4 and 13,
  interleukin 10 signaling pathway, and aspirin ADME pathway. After pathway analysis,
  we can exactly relate how sickle cell disease alters the gene expression and how
  these genes affect the different pathways. Additionally, we performed gene ontology
  of 60 genes and identified the gene biological process, cellular component, and
  molecular functions as we mentioned in our results. With the help of our study data,
  there is a chance for pre-identification of sickle cell disease person. Our gene
  result was used as a biomarker of sickle cell disease. In this paper, our result
  is the primary approach for sickle cell disease; with the help of this paper any
  researcher can get their primary data and use that for further research.'
