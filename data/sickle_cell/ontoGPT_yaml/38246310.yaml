input_text: 'Computing Sickle Erythrocyte Health Index on quantitative phase imaging
  and machine learning.Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder characterized
  by abnormal hemoglobin and deformation of red blood cells (RBCs), leading to complications
  and reduced life expectancy. This study developed an in vitro assessment, the Sickle
  Erythrocyte Health Index, using quantitative phase imaging (QPI) and machine learning
  to model the health of RBCs in people with SCD. The health index combines assessment
  of cell deformation, sickle-shaped classification, and membrane flexibility to evaluate
  erythrocyte health. Using QPI and image processing, the percentage of sickle-shaped
  cells and membrane flexibility were quantified. Statistically significant differences
  were observed between individuals with and without SCD, indicating the impact of
  underlying pathophysiology on erythrocyte health. Additionally, sodium metabisulfite
  led to an increase in sickle-shaped cells and a decrease in flexibility in the sickle
  cell blood samples. Based on these findings, two approaches were used to calculate
  the Sickle Erythrocyte Health Index: one using hand-crafted features and one using
  learned features from deep learning models. Both indices showed significant differences
  between non-SCD and SCD groups and sensitivity to changes induced by sodium metabisulfite.
  The Sickle Erythrocyte Health Index has important clinical implications for SCD
  management and could be used by providers when making treatment decisions. Further
  research is warranted to evaluate the clinical utility and applicability of the
  Sickle Erythrocyte Health Index in diverse patient populations.'
