input_text: Integrated automated particle tracking microfluidic enables high-throughput
  cell deformability cytometry for red cell disorders. Investigating individual red
  blood cells (RBCs) is critical to understanding hematologic diseases, as pathology
  often originates at the single-cell level. Many RBC disorders manifest in altered
  biophysical properties, such as deformability of RBCs. Due to limitations in current
  biophysical assays, there exists a need for high-throughput analysis of RBC deformability
  with single-cell resolution. To that end, we present a method that pairs a simple
  in vitro artificial microvasculature network system with an innovative MATLAB-based
  automated particle tracking program, allowing for high-throughput, single-cell deformability
  index (sDI) measurements of entire RBC populations. We apply our technology to quantify
  the sDI of RBCs from healthy volunteers, Sickle cell disease (SCD) patients, a transfusion-dependent
  beta thalassemia major patient, and in stored packed RBCs (pRBCs) that undergo storage
  lesion over 4 weeks. Moreover, our system can also measure cell size for each RBC,
  thereby enabling 2D analysis of cell deformability vs cell size with single cell
  resolution akin to flow cytometry. Our results demonstrate the clear existence of
  distinct biophysical RBC subpopulations with high interpatient variability in SCD
  as indicated by large magnitude skewness and kurtosis values of distribution, the
  "shifting" of sDI vs RBC size curves over transfusion cycles in beta thalassemia,
  and the appearance of low sDI RBC subpopulations within 4 days of pRBC storage.
  Overall, our system offers an inexpensive, convenient, and high-throughput method
  to gauge single RBC deformability and size for any RBC population and has the potential
  to aid in disease monitoring and transfusion guidelines for various RBC disorders.
