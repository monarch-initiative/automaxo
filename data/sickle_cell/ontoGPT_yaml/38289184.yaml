input_text: 'RH genotypes and red cell alloimmunization rates in chronically transfused
  patients with sickle cell disease: A multisite study in the USA.BACKGROUND: Red
  cell alloimmunization remains a challenge for individuals with sickle cell disease
  (SCD) and contributes to increased risk of hemolytic transfusion reactions and associated
  comorbidities. Despite prophylactic serological matching for ABO, Rh, and K, red
  cell alloimmunization persists, in part, due to a high frequency of variant RH alleles
  in patients with SCD and Black blood donors. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We compared
  RH genotypes and rates of alloimmunization in 342 pediatric and young adult patients
  with SCD on chronic transfusion therapy exposed to >90,000 red cell units at five
  sites across the USA. Genotyping was performed with RHD and RHCE BeadChip arrays
  and targeted assays. RESULTS: Prevalence of overall and Rh-specific alloimmunization
  varied among institutions, ranging from 5% to 41% (p = .0035) and 5%-33% (p = .0002),
  respectively. RH genotyping demonstrated that 33% RHD and 57% RHCE alleles were
  variant in this cohort. Patients with RHCE alleles encoding partial e antigens had
  higher rates of anti-e identified than those encoding at least one conventional
  e antigen (p = .0007). There was no difference in anti-D, anti-C, or anti-E formation
  among patients with predicted partial or altered antigen expression compared to
  those with conventional antigens, suggesting that variant Rh on donor cells may
  also stimulate alloimmunization to these antigens. DISCUSSION: These results highlight
  variability in alloimmunization rates and suggest that a molecular approach to Rh
  antigen matching may be necessary for optimal prevention of alloimmunization given
  the high prevalence of variant RH alleles among both patients and Black donors.'
