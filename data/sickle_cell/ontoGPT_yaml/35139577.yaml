input_text: 'Main Complications during Pregnancy and Recommendations for Adequate
  Antenatal Care in Sickle Cell Disease: A Literature Review. Sickle cell disease
  (SCD) is the most common monogenic disease worldwide, with a variable prevalence
  in each continent. A single nucleotide substitution leads to an amino-acid change
  in the beta-globin chain, altering the normal structure ofhemoglobin, which is then
  called hemoglobin S inherited in homozygosity (HbSS) or double heterozygosity (HbSC,
  HbSbeta), and leads to chronic hemolysis, vaso-occlusion, inflammation, and endothelium
  activation. Pregnant women with SCD are at a higher risk of developing maternal
  and perinatal complications. We performed a narrative review of the literature considering
  SCD and pregnancy, the main clinical and obstetrical complications, the specific
  antenatal care, and the follow-up for maternal and fetal surveillance. Pregnant
  women with SCD are at a higher risk of developing clinical and obstetric complications
  such as pain episodes, pulmonary complications, infections, thromboembolic events,
  preeclampsia, and maternal death. Their newborns are also at an increased risk of
  developing neonatal complications: fetal growth restriction, preterm birth, stillbirth.
  Severe complications can occur in patients of any genotype. We concluded that SCD
  is a high-risk condition that increases maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality.
  A multidisciplinary approach during pregnancy and the postpartum period is key to
  adequately diagnose and treat complications.'
