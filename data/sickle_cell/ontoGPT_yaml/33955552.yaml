input_text: 'Transfusion management of severe anaemia in African children: a consensus
  algorithm. The phase III Transfusion and Treatment of severe anaemia in African
  Children Trial (TRACT) found that conservative management of uncomplicated severe
  anaemia [haemoglobin (Hb) 40-60 g/l] was safe, and that transfusion volume (20 vs.
  30 ml/kg whole blood equivalent) for children with severe anaemia (Hb <60 g/l) had
  strong but opposing effects on mortality, depending on fever status (>37 5 C). In
  2020 a stakeholder meeting of paediatric and blood transfusion groups from Africa
  reviewed the results and additional analyses. Among all 3196 children receiving
  an initial transfusion there was no evidence that nutritional status, presence of
  shock, malaria parasite burden or sickle cell disease status influenced outcomes
  or modified the interaction with fever status on volume required. Fever status at
  the time of ordering blood was a reliable determinant of volume required for optimal
  outcome. Elevated heart and respiratory rates normalised irrespective of transfusion
  volume and without diuretics. By consensus, a transfusion management algorithm was
  developed, incorporating three additional measurements of Hb post-admission, alongside
  clinical monitoring. The proposed algorithm should help clinicians safely implement
  findings from TRACT. Further research should assess its implementation in routine
  clinical practice.'
