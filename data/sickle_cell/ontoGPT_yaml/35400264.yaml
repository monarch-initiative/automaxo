input_text: 'Strategies to increase access to basic sickle cell disease care in low-
  and middle-income countries.INTRODUCTION: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most
  common hemoglobinopathy in the world. Over 90% of those born with SCD live in low-
  and middle-income countries (LMICs), yet individuals in these settings have much
  poorer outcomes compared to those in high-income countries. AREAS COVERED: This
  manuscript provides an in-depth review of the cornerstones of basic SCD care, the
  barriers to implementing these in LMICs, and strategies to increase access in these
  regions. Publications in English language, peer-reviewed, and edited from 2000 to
  2021 were identified on PubMed. Google search was used for gray literature. EXPERT
  OPINION: Outcomes for patients with SCD in high-income countries have improved over
  the last few decades due to the implementation of universal newborn screening programs
  and use of routine antimicrobial prophylaxis, increase in therapeutic and curative
  options, and the adoption of specific measures to decrease risk of stroke. This
  success has not translated to LMICs due to several reasons including resource constraints.
  A combination of several strategies is needed to increase access to basic SCD care
  for patients in these settings.'
