input_text: 'Understanding the demand for phenotyped red blood cell units and requests
  to perform molecular red blood cell typing for Australian patients. BACKGROUND:
  Australian Red Cross Lifeblood has seen a 50 % increase in demand for phenotyped
  red blood cell (RBC) units between 2016-2018 and a 30 % increase in demand in 2018
  to perform molecular RBC typing on patient samples. Lifeblood conducted a survey
  to understand transfusion laboratory practices for requesting patient phenotyping
  and/or molecular RBC typing and for selecting phenotyped RBC units in various patient
  groups. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: An electronic Qualtrics survey form was sent to
  296 transfusion laboratories with questions designed to understand the practice
  of selecting phenotyped RBC units and reasons for requesting extended serology or
  molecular RBC typing. RESULTS: 49 (16.6 %) transfusion laboratories provided data.
  Reasons to request extended phenotyping and/or molecular RBC typing for patients
  included; chronic transfusion (n = 31 laboratories), sickle cell disease (n = 25),
  Thalassemia (n = 23), requirement for anti-CD38 or other MAB therapy (n = 23) or
  Myelodysplasia (n = 22). Forty-seven transfusion laboratories provided responses
  with reasons for requesting molecular RBC typing which included: predicting phenotype
  in patients with multiple antibodies (n = 31), prior to administering anti-CD38
  or other MAB therapies (n = 29), for pregnancy related transfusions (n = 28) or
  for confirming the phenotype of recently transfused patients (n = 18). CONCLUSION:
  Transfusion laboratory practices indicated that phenotyped RBC units were selected
  for patients requiring chronic transfusion support and/or undergoing MAB therapy.
  Requests for molecular RBC typing occurred for more complex patient requirements
  where serological investigations were not suitable or possible due to reagent restrictions.'
