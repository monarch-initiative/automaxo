input_text: Base editing of haematopoietic stem cells rescues sickle cell disease
  in mice. Sickle cell disease (SCD) is caused by a mutation in the beta-globin gene
  HBB1. We used a custom adenine base editor (ABE8e-NRCH)2,3 to convert the SCD allele
  (HBBS) into Makassar beta-globin (HBBG), a non-pathogenic variant4,5. Ex vivo delivery
  of mRNA encoding the base editor with a targeting guide RNA into haematopoietic
  stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) from patients with SCD resulted in 80% conversion
  of HBBS to HBBG. Sixteen weeks after transplantation of edited human HSPCs into
  immunodeficient mice, the frequency of HBBG was 68% and hypoxia-induced sickling
  of bone marrow reticulocytes had decreased fivefold, indicating durable gene editing.
  To assess the physiological effects of HBBS base editing, we delivered ABE8e-NRCH
  and guide RNA into HSPCs from a humanized SCD mouse6 and then transplanted these
  cells into irradiated mice. After sixteen weeks, Makassar beta-globin represented
  79% of beta-globin protein in blood, and hypoxia-induced sickling was reduced threefold.
  Mice that received base-edited HSPCs showed near-normal haematological parameters
  and reduced splenic pathology compared to mice that received unedited cells. Secondary
  transplantation of edited bone marrow confirmed that the gene editing was durable
  in long-term haematopoietic stem cells and showed that HBBS-to-HBBG editing of 20%
  or more is sufficient for phenotypic rescue. Base editing of human HSPCs avoided
  the p53 activation and larger deletions that have been observed following Cas9 nuclease
  treatment. These findings point towards a one-time autologous treatment for SCD
  that eliminates pathogenic HBBS, generates benign HBBG, and minimizes the undesired
  consequences of double-strand DNA breaks.
