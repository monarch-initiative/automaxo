input_text: Gross anterior segment ischaemia following vitreoretinal surgery for sickle-cell
  retinopathy. We report the case of a 32-year-old Afrocaribbean man with known stage
  3 proliferative sickle-cell retinopathy who presented with a mixed picture of tractional
  and rhegmatogenous macula off detachment. He underwent left primary 25 g vitrectomy
  with silicone oil, delamination and endolaser photocoagulation under a general anaesthetic.
  He, however, presented 48 hours postoperatively with gross anterior segment ischaemia.
  His pain and ocular signs settled over the course of a few days following administration
  of supplemental oxygen, oral steroids, analgesia and intravenous hydration. Examination
  showed resolution of his proptosis and orbital signs as well as anterior segment
  inflammation. He remains under follow-up.
