input_text: 'Point-of-care brain ultrasound and transcranial doppler or color-coded
  doppler in critically ill neonates and children.Point-of-care brain ultrasound and
  transcranial doppler or color-coded doppler is being increasingly used as an essential
  diagnostic and monitoring tool at the bedside of critically ill neonates and children.
  Brain ultrasound has already established as a cornerstone of daily practice in the
  management of the critically ill newborn for diagnosis and follow-up of the most
  common brain diseases, considering the easiness to insonate the brain through transfontanellar
  window. In critically ill children, doppler based techniques are used to assess
  cerebral hemodynamics in acute brain injury and recommended for screening patients
  suffering from sickle cell disease at risk for stroke. However, more evidence is
  needed regarding the accuracy of doppler based techniques for non-invasive estimation
  of cerebral perfusion pressure and intracranial pressure, as well as regarding the
  accuracy of brain ultrasound for diagnosis and monitoring of acute brain parenchyma
  alterations in children. This review is aimed at providing a comprehensive overview
  for clinicians of the technical, anatomical, and physiological basics for brain
  ultrasonography and transcranial doppler or color-coded doppler, and of the current
  status and future perspectives of their clinical applications in critically ill
  neonates and children. CONCLUSION: In critically ill neonates, brain ultrasound
  for diagnosis and follow-up of the most common cerebral pathologies of the neonatal
  period may be considered the standard of care. Data are needed about the possible
  role of doppler techniques for the assessment of cerebral perfusion and vasoreactivity
  of the critically ill neonate with open fontanelles. In pediatric critical care,
  doppler based techniques should be routinely adopted to assess and monitor cerebral
  hemodynamics. New technologies and more evidence are needed to improve the accuracy
  of brain ultrasound for the assessment of brain parenchyma of critically ill children
  with fibrous fontanelles. WHAT IS KNOWN:   In critically ill neonates, brain ultrasound
  for early diagnosis and follow-up of the most common cerebral and neurovascular
  pathologies of the neonatal period is a cornerstone of daily practice. In critically
  ill children, doppler-based techniques are more routinely used to assess cerebral
  hemodynamics and autoregulation after acute brain injury and to screen patients
  at risk for vasospasm or stroke (e.g., sickle cell diseases, right-to-left shunts).
  WHAT IS NEW:   In critically ill neonates, research is currently focusing on the
  use of novel high frequency probes, even higher than 10 MHz, especially for extremely
  preterm babies. Furthermore, data are needed about the role of doppler based techniques
  for the assessment of cerebral perfusion and vasoreactivity of the critically ill
  neonate with open fontanelles, also integrated with a non-invasive assessment of
  brain oxygenation. In pediatric critical care, new technologies should be developed
  to improve the accuracy of brain ultrasound for the assessment of brain parenchyma
  of critically ill children with fibrous fontanelles. Furthermore, large multicenter
  studies are needed to clarify role and accuracy of doppler-based techniques to assess
  cerebral perfusion pressure and its changes after treatment interventions.'
