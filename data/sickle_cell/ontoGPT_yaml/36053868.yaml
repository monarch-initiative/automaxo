input_text: "Algorithm-based selection of automated red blood cell exchange procedure
  goals reduces blood utilization in chronically transfused adults with sickle cell
  disease. BACKGROUND: Automated red cell exchange (RCE) is a common treatment for
  patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Two key parameters are used to determine
  the volume of blood for RCE to reduce sickle hemoglobin (eg, HbS): fraction of cells
  remaining (FCR) and target hematocrit. We evaluated how the calculated FCR-using
  the manufacturer's algorithm-impacted blood utilization and incidence of acute care
  encounters. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Retrospective chart review was conducted of
  15 adults with SCD who underwent chronic RCE from July 1, 2015 to August 31, 2019.
  Blood utilization and acute care encounters were compared across three time periods:
  (a) when a fixed FCR of 30% was used (12 months); (b) transition period during which
  physicians made ad hoc changes to the FCR (25 months); (c) algorithm phase when
  a procedural FCR between 30% and 50% was selected using an algorithm generated by
  the manufacturer's built-in software to target a HbS fraction of 8% post-procedure
  (12 months). Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to determine statistical significance.
  RESULTS: Median blood utilization per procedure decreased from 2398 mL (interquartile
  range [IQR]: 2271-2759 mL) during the fixed FCR phase to 1887 mL (IQR: 1495-2241
  mL) during the algorithm phase (P < 0.001). Similarly, median number of units transfused
  decreased from 10 (9-11) to 7 (5-9) during the respective phases (P < 0.001). Visits
  to the emergency department were 1 (0-4) in the fixed FCR phase and 0 (0-3) in the
  algorithm phase. CONCLUSION: Algorithm-based selection of a procedural FCR significantly
  reduced blood utilization (~21%) without appearing to increase acute care encounters."
