input_text: "Cardiovascular benefits of a home-based exercise program in patients
  with sickle cell disease. BACKGROUND: Physical inactivity is an important risk factor
  for cardiovascular disease. The benefits of exercise in patients with chronic diseases,
  including cardiovascular diseases, are well established. For patients with sickle
  cell disease, medical recommendation was to avoid physical exercise for fear of
  triggering painful crises or increasing the impairment of the cardiopulmonary function.
  Only recently, studies have shown safety in exercise programs for this population.
  Despite that, there is no report that assess the effects of physical exercise on
  cardiac parameters in patients with sickle cell disease. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed
  to evaluate the impact of regular physical exercise (a home-based program) on cardiovascular
  function in patients with sickle cell disease. DESIGN: A quasi-randomized prospective
  controlled trial. SETTING: During the years 2015 and 2016, we started recruiting
  among adult patients treated at a Brazilian Center for Patients with Sickle Cell
  Disease to participate in a study involving a home exercise program. The experimental
  (exercise) and control groups were submitted to clinical evaluation and cardiovascular
  tests before and after the intervention. Analysis of variance was applied to compare
  groups, considering time and group factors. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-seven adult outpatients
  with a sickle cell disease diagnosis. INTERVENTIONS: Exercise group (N = 14): a
  regular home-based aerobic exercise program, three to five times per week not exceeding
  give times per week, for eight weeks; no prescription for the control group (N =
  13). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Echocardiographic and treadmill test parameters. RESULTS:
  The exercise group showed significant improvement in cardiovascular tests, demonstrated
  by increased distance traveled on a treadmill (p<0.01), increased ejection fraction
  (p < 0.01) and improvement of diastolic function assessed by mitral tissue Doppler
  E' wave on echocardiography (p = 0.04). None of the patients presented a sickle
  cell crisis or worsening of symptoms during the exercise program. CONCLUSION: The
  selected home-based exercise program is safe, feasible, and promotes a favorable
  impact on functional capacity and cardiovascular function in sickle cell disease
  patients."
