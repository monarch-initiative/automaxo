input_text: Males with sickle cell disease have higher risks of cerebrovascular disease,
  increased inflammation, and a reduced response to hydroxyurea. Biological sex is
  important. Male sex is associated with worse outcomes in most measures, including
  cerebrovascular disease, hospital admissions, and blood transfusions, but not survival.
  Females also appear to have a better response to hydroxyurea therapy, reduced markers
  of inflammation, and better liver function.
