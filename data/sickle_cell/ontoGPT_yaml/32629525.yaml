input_text: 'Use of dual lumen ports for red blood cell exchange: A comparison of
  adults and children with sickle cell disease. PURPOSE: Sickle cell patients receiving
  chronic RBC exchange require a form of long-term central venous access if peripheral
  access is inadequate. In adults, dual lumen (DL) ports have been utilized but associated
  with greater procedure complications and duration when compared to other forms of
  access. In the pediatric sickle cell population, the use of DL ports for RBC exchange
  has not been well described. In this retrospective cohort study, RBC exchange procedures
  utilizing DL ports in the pediatric vs adult sickle cell population were compared.
  METHODS: Medical records were reviewed for 685 RBC exchange procedures performed
  on 25 patients (11 pediatric and 14 adult) between November 2014 to November 2018.
  Patient-level characteristics and outcomes were compared between pediatric and adult
  patients using the Fisher-exact and Wilcoxon-rank sum test. Linear/logistic regression
  models examined procedure-level parameters and port characteristics with adjustment
  for clustering. RESULTS: Compared to adults, pediatric patients had slower average
  maximum inlet speed (42 vs 53 mL/min, P < .01), but shorter procedure time (60 vs
  75 minutes, P < .01) and lower rate of access alarms (1% vs 11%, P < .01). Overall,
  0.29 thrombotic events per 1000 port days and 0.04 infections per 1000 port days
  were observed. CONCLUSION: For adult and pediatric sickle cell patients, a DL port
  provides a viable option for RBC exchange. In comparison to adults, pediatric procedures
  with a DL port will typically be shorter and with less procedural complications
  due to smaller blood volumes and lower flow requirements.'
