input_text: CRISPR-Cas9 Gene Editing for Sickle Cell Disease and beta-Thalassemia.
  Transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia (TDT) and sickle cell disease (SCD) are severe
  monogenic diseases with severe and potentially life-threatening manifestations.
  BCL11A is a transcription factor that represses gamma-globin expression and fetal
  hemoglobin in erythroid cells. We performed electroporation of CD34+ hematopoietic
  stem and progenitor cells obtained from healthy donors, with CRISPR-Cas9 targeting
  the BCL11A erythroid-specific enhancer. Approximately 80% of the alleles at this
  locus were modified, with no evidence of off-target editing. After undergoing myeloablation,
  two patients - one with TDT and the other with SCD - received autologous CD34+ cells
  edited with CRISPR-Cas9 targeting the same BCL11A enhancer. More than a year later,
  both patients had high levels of allelic editing in bone marrow and blood, increases
  in fetal hemoglobin that were distributed pancellularly, transfusion independence,
  and (in the patient with SCD) elimination of vaso-occlusive episodes. (Funded by
  CRISPR Therapeutics and Vertex Pharmaceuticals; ClinicalTrials.gov numbers, NCT03655678
  for CLIMB THAL-111 and NCT03745287 for CLIMB SCD-121.).
