input_text: 'Return visit rates after an emergency department discharge for children
  with sickle cell pain episodes. BACKGROUND: High return visit rates after hospitalization
  for people with sickle cell disease (SCD) have been previously established. Due
  to a lack of multicenter emergency department (ED) return visit rate data, the return
  visit rate following ED discharge for pediatric SCD pain treatment is currently
  unknown. PROCEDURE: A seven-site retrospective cohort study of discharged ED visits
  for pain by children with SCD was conducted using the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied
  Research Network Registry. Visits between January 2017 and November 2021 were identified
  using previously validated criteria. The primary outcome was the 14-day return visit
  rate, with 3- and 7-day rates also calculated. Modified Poisson regression was used
  to analyze associations for age, sex, initial hospitalization rate, and a visit
  during the COVID-19 pandemic with return visit rates. RESULTS: Of 2548 eligible
  ED visits, approximately 52% were patients less than 12 years old, 50% were female,
  and over 95% were non-Hispanic Black. The overall 14-day return visit rate was 29.1%
  (95% confidence interval [CI]: 27.4%-30.9%; site range 22.7%-31.7%); the 7- and
  3-day return visit rates were 23.0% (95% CI: 21.3%-24.6%) and 16.7% (95% CI: 15.3%-18.2%),
  respectively. Younger children had slightly lower 14-day return visit rates (27.3%
  vs. 31.1%); there were no associations for site hospitalization rate, sex, and a
  visit occurring during the pandemic with 14-day returns. CONCLUSION: Nearly 30%
  of ED discharged visits after SCD pain treatment had a return visit within 14 days.
  Increased efforts are needed to identify causes for high ED return visit rates and
  ensure optimal ED and post-ED care.'
