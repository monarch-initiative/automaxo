input_text: "Impact of COVID-19 infection among indian sickle cell disease patients.Background:
  Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the most common hemoglobinopathy disorders and
  is widely prevalent in India, especially in the tribal population. SCD patients
  are prone to develop recurrent respiratory infections and related complications
  owing to the microvascular occlusion and impaired immunological response. Objectives:
  We aimed to determine the prevalence and impact of COVID-19 in SCD patients from
  India. Methodology: We conducted a cross-sectional study in Chandrapur district
  of Maharashtra, India, between August and October 2021. After taking informed consent,
  details of 300 SCD patients' demographic data, history of COVID-19 testing, infection,
  symptoms related to COVID-19 in the past 1 year, hospitalization, complications,
  mortality, COVID-19 vaccination, and side effects were recorded. Results: We found
  that 93 (31%) of SCD patients had influenza-like symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic
  with symptoms of fever (81.72%), cough (35.48%), sore throat (18.27%), headache
  (15.05%), and breathlessness (7.52%). A total of 13 (4.33%) SCD among 300 SCD were
  tested as COVID positive. Majority of them were mild cases and the 1st dose of COVID-19
  vaccine was received by 47 (29.37%) of SCD patients and 10 (6.02%) of the patient
  had received second dose of vaccine. Conclusion: Low incidence of COVID-19 and milder
  disease spectrum in our study cohort suggests that there is no increased risk of
  COVID-19 mortality and morbidity in SCD patients compared to general population.
  However, the reason for low COVID vaccination in our study could be due to the fear
  of complications of COVID vaccine."
