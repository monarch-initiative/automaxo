input_text: 'Laboratory predictors of sickle cell disease severity: a cross-sectional
  study. Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common monogenic disorder, although
  the diversity and heterogenicity of clinical presentations render estimations of
  disease severity unpredictable. This cross-sectional study aimed to determine if
  laboratory markers could serve as indicators of SCD severity. We enrolled 90 adult
  patients with SCD with a mean age of 32.33 +- 11.84 years from the eastern province
  of Saudi Arabia, where SCD is more common than in other regions. Our study revealed
  a positive significant association between the number of hospitalizations and emergency
  visits with white blood cells (WBC) (R = 0.241, R = 0.207), respectively. Similarly,
  positive significant associations were found between the number of hospitalizations
  and emergency visits with platelets (R = 0.393, R = 0.276), respectively. Conversely,
  negative significant relationships were found between the number of hospitalizations
  and emergency visits (ER) with hemoglobin (Hb) F (R = -0.268, R = -0.263), respectively.
  Additionally, significant negative relationships were found between Hb F (R = -0.223)
  and the frequency of ICU admission. Only the number of hospitalizations and emergency
  visits annually were significantly predicted with P values of 0.021 and 0.038, respectively.
  Moreover, an increase in WBC was found to significantly increase the chance of undergoing
  splenectomy by 23.02%. SCD is a multisystemic disease with heterogeneous clinical
  presentations and disease severity. Inflammatory markers are valuable tools for
  better risk stratification and could be translated into developing new therapeutic
  strategies and modifying the treatment paradigm.'
