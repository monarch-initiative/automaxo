input_text: 'Haploidentical Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation in Sickle Cell Disease:
  A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
  (SCT) is the sole established curative treatment option for patients with sickle
  cell disease (SCD). However, a lack of HLA-identical sibling donors is a limiting
  factor. Haploidentical related donors are a promising donor pool, potentially extending
  SCT as a curative treatment option to a larger group of patients with no other meaningful
  treatment options for their severe SCD. In the present study, we aimed to systematically
  review the results of haploidentical SCT in patients with SCD. A comprehensive search
  was performed in MEDLINE/PubMed and Embase up to May 2021. Data were extracted by
  2 reviewers independently, and the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale was
  used to assess the quality of the studies. Fourteen studies met our inclusion criteria.
  To provide an overview of the results of haploidentical SCT, we grouped the studies
  into myeloablative conditioning versus nonmyeloablative conditioning as well as
  into in vitro versus in vivo (ie, with post-transplantation cyclophosphamide) T
  cell depletion with a subgroup meta-analysis of proportions. All the included studies
  were observational cohort studies. Only 3 of these studies reported data for both
  matched sibling donor (MSD) SCT and haploidentical SCT. Based on a comparative meta-analysis
  of the 3 studies that included both haploidentical and MSD transplantation, graft
  failure was significantly higher in the haploidentical group than in the MSD group
  (odds ratio, 5.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0 to 27.6). Overall survival was
  not significantly different between the groups. A subgroup meta-analysis of the
  results of haploidentical SCT showed relatively low overall pooled proportions of
  graft failure (7%; 95% CI, 2% to 20%), acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (4%;
  95% CI, 2% to 12%), and chronic GVHD (11%; 95% CI, 7% to 16%). Overall survival
  (OS) was high in all the included studies (91%; 95% CI, 85% to 94%). Adjustments
  to the conditioning regimens, robust pretransplantation and post-transplantation
  T cell depletion, and improved supportive care have resulted in reduced graft failure
  and improved OS following haploidentical SCT in patients with SCD. We conclude that
  the safety of haploidentical SCT in SCD patients has improved significantly, and
  that this should be considered as a curative option in patients with severe SCD.'
