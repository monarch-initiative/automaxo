input_text: Exploiting CD1-restricted T cells for clinical benefit. CD1-restricted
  T cells were first described over 30 years ago along with the cloning of the CD1
  family. Around the same time, invariant Natural Killer cells (iNKT) were identified
  based on invariant TCR-alpha chains with additional expression of natural killer
  (NK) cell markers. About 5 years later, iNKT were shown to react with CD1d. Since
  then, iNKT have been shown to be a major population of CD1d-restricted T cells in
  humans and many animals. Like NK cells, iNKT are innate lymphocytes with rapid and
  wide-ranging effector potential. These activities include cytotoxicity and an unusually
  broad and high-level cytokine production. The development of highly-specific methods
  of isolating, stimulating, expanding or depleting these relatively rare cells and
  controlling their potent activities has stimulated considerable interest in therapeutic
  targeting of iNKT cells. Potential applications include cancers, inflammatory, infectious
  and autoimmune among other diseases. To date, most trials have targeted various
  cancers, there are 2 published trials in viral hepatitis and one in sickle cell
  lung disease. Uniform safety, evidence of immunologic activity and increasingly
  clinical efficacy have been seen. Approaches to targeting iNKT cells in clinical
  development include highly specific natural glycolipid ligands presented by CD1d
  and chemical analogues thereof and monoclonal antibody-based targeting of iNKT cells.
  In the case of iNKT cell-based therapies, novel approaches include arming them with
  Chimeric Antigen Receptors (CARs) and recombinant TCRs (rTCR), gene editing and
  allogeneic use. Controlling the iTCR:CD1d molecular interaction and consequences
  is a unique and promising therapeutic technology.
