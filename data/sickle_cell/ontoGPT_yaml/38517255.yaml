input_text: 'Effect of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation on sickle
  cell disease-related organ complications: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
  Sickle cell disease (SCD)-related organ complications are a major cause of morbidity
  and mortality in patients with SCD. We sought to assess whether hematopoietic stem
  cell transplantation (HSCT) stabilizes, attenuates, or exacerbates organ decline.
  We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of trials investigating organ
  function before and after HSCT in patients with SCD. We searched MEDLINE/PubMed
  and EMBASE up to September 21, 2023. Continuous data were expressed as standardized
  mean difference (SMD) and pooled in a weighted inverse-variance random-effects model;
  binomial data were expressed as risk ratio (RR) using the Mantel-Haenszel random-effects
  meta-analyses. Of 823 screened studies, 34 were included in this review. Of these,
  17 (774 patients, 23.6% adults, 86.3% HLA-identical sibling donor, 56.7% myeloablative
  conditioning regimen) were included in the meta-analyses. Pulmonary function remained
  stable. Mean tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity decreased but did not reach statistical
  significance. In children, estimated glomerular filtration rate decreased (SMD -0.80,
  p = .01), and the presence of proteinuria increased (RR 2.00, p = <.01), while splenic
  uptake and phagocytic function improved (RR 0.31, p = <.01; RR 0.23, p = <.01).
  Cerebral blood flow improved (SMD -1.39, p = <.01), and a low incidence of stroke
  after transplantation in high-risk patients was found. Retinopathy and avascular
  osteonecrosis were investigated in only one study, showing no significant changes.
  While HSCT can improve some SCD-related organ dysfunctions, transplantation-related
  toxicity may have an adverse effect on others. Future research should focus on identifying
  individuals with SCD who might benefit most from HSCT and which forms of organ damage
  are more likely to exacerbate post-transplantation.'
