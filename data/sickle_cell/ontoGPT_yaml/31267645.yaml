input_text: Higher executive abilities following a blood transfusion in children and
  young adults with sickle cell disease. Individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD)
  experience cognitive deficits; however, it remains unclear whether medical treatments
  for SCD improve cognition. Given that executive abilities are typically impaired
  in individuals with SCD, they were the focus of the current study. Our primary hypothesis
  was that executive abilities would be higher acutely soon after a blood transfusion
  in children and young adults with SCD. We used tests from the NIH Toolbox to assess
  executive abilities in 27 participants with SCD receiving chronic transfusion in
  comparison to 34 participants with SCD receiving hydroxyurea (HU) and 41 non-SCD
  demographically matched controls, all of whom were tested at two time points. Participants
  in the transfusion group completed cognitive testing within 3 days after a transfusion
  (soon after transfusion) and then within 3 days before their next transfusion (long
  after transfusion) over an interval of 3-7 weeks. We found that executive abilities
  were significantly poorer for the transfusion and HU groups than for the control
  group. In support of our primary hypothesis, executive abilities for the transfusion
  group were significantly better soon after a transfusion compared to long after
  a transfusion, chi2 (1) = 17.8, P < .0001. Our results demonstrate that executive
  abilities were higher acutely following a blood transfusion. These findings have
  implications for daily functioning, medical decision making, and academic achievement
  in children and young adults with SCD.
