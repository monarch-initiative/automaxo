input_text: 'Myelopathy in sickle cell disease: a case-oriented review.INTRODUCTION:
  Although neurological complications are well recognized in patients with sickle
  cell disease, myelopathy has been rarely described, with few reported cases of compressive
  and ischemic myelopathy. We present the first case report of longitudinally extensive
  myelitis (LETM) in SCD and review the differential diagnosis of myelopathy in these
  patients. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 29-year-old African-Brazilian
  man with SCD, who experienced a subacute flaccid paraparesis, with T2 sensory level
  and urinary retention. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed a lymphocytic pleocytosis
  and increased protein levels. MRI disclosed a longitudinally extensive spinal cord
  lesion, with a high T2/STIR signal extending from C2 to T12. We searched Medline/PubMed,
  Embase, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases for myelopathy in SCD patients. DISCUSSION:
  Spinal cord compression by vertebral fractures, extramedullary hematopoietic tissue,
  and Salmonella epidural abscess have been reported in SCD. We found only three case
  reports of spinal cord infarction, which is unexpectedly infrequent compared to
  the prevalence of cerebral infarction in SCD. We found only one case report of varicella-zoster
  myelitis and no previous report of LETM in SCD patients. Specific and time-sensitive
  causes of myelopathy should be considered in SCD patients. In addition to compression
  and ischemia, LETM is a possible mechanism of spinal cord involvement in SCD patients.'
