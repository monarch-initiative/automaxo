input_text: The liver in sickle cell disease.Liver involvement in SCD patients is
  frequent but often misdiagnosed or underestimated, except in case of advanced liver
  diseases. Because of so far poorly recognized forms of chronic SCD-related vascular
  injury that can silently evolved towards end stages or facilitate ACLF, any persisting
  liver function tests abnormalities should be carefully investigated, following the
  above proposed algorithm. Work up and management must be considered multidisciplinary
  in relationship with a Hepatologist. Early SCD hepatopathy should prompt revision
  of SCD management to prevent further liver injury and decompensation, discussing
  transfusion exchanges and hydro urea when not yet initiated, and control for any
  cofactor of liver injury. The role of HSCT in early SCD hepatopathies also deserves
  evaluation. In advanced SCD hepatopathies, liver transplantation, which has been
  rarely performed so far, is the only therapeutic option associated with improved
  survival. It should definitely be discussed- either electively in case of decompensation
  in SCD cirrhosis or jaundice/recurrent cholangitis in cholestatic diseases, with
  excellent outcome, - or emergently in case of ALF or ACLF with more mitigate results.
  To improve knowledge and management of SCD liver diseases, creation of national
  and international registries, as well as longitudinal observational cohorts are
  encouraged.
