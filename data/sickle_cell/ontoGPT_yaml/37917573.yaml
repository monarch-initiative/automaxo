input_text: 'Painless Orbital Bone Infarction in a Child with Sickle Cell Anemia:
  A Case of Misdiagnosed Periorbital Cellulitis.BACKGROUND Sickle cell orbitopathy
  is a rare complication of sickle cell disease that closely mimics other conditions,
  such as orbital cellulitis and osteomyelitis. We report a case of painless orbital
  bone infarction masquerading as periorbital cellulitis in a child with sickle cell
  anemia. CASE REPORT A 4-year-old Saudi girl with sickle cell disease presented to
  our hospital with vaso-occlusive crisis characterized by bilateral lower limb pain
  and painless left orbital swelling. On examination, she had swelling of the left
  upper eyelid with redness and mild ptosis (margin reflex distance 1 was 2 mm) without
  proptosis. Magnetic resonance imaging with contrast showed bilateral sub-periosteal
  heterogeneous collections (2x0.8x2.1 cm in the superolateral wall of the left orbit
  and 1x0.6 cm in the inferolateral wall of the right orbit), with intermediate-to-high
  T1 signal intensity and high T2 signal, causing a mass effect on the adjacent superior
  and lateral rectus muscles. The patient was treated with systemic antibiotics and
  supportive treatment for vaso-occlusive crisis under the care of the pediatric team
  and was discharged without complications. CONCLUSIONS The diagnosis of sickle cell
  orbitopathy can be challenging, and an accurate diagnosis is essential to ensure
  appropriate management. Thus, we report the case of a 4-year-old child with painless
  sickle cell orbitopathy masquerading as pre-septal cellulitis.'
