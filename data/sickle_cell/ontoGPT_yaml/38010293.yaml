input_text: Defining curative endpoints for sickle cell disease in the era of gene
  therapy and gene editing. A growing number of gene therapy- and gene editing-based
  treatments for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) are entering clinical trials.
  These treatments, designed to target the underlying cause of SCD, have the potential
  to provide functional cures, which until now were possible only through allogeneic
  hematopoietic stem cell transplant. However, as these novel approaches advance from
  early- to late-stage clinical trials, it is essential to identify physiologically
  and clinically relevant endpoints that can demonstrate the achievement of a functional
  cure for SCD. Here, we present an overview of the pathophysiology of SCD and current
  treatment options, review ongoing SCD clinical trials using gene therapy or gene
  editing approaches, and identify the most relevant endpoints for demonstrating the
  attainment of a functional cure for SCD.
