input_text: 'Acute chest syndrome in children with sickle cell disease: Data from
  a national AIEOP cohort identify priority areas of intervention in a hub-and-spoke
  system. Acute chest syndrome (ACS) is a frequent cause of hospitalization in sickle
  cell disease (SCD). Despite advances in acute care, many settings still lack knowledge
  about ACS best practices. After the AIEOP Guidelines were published in 2012, suggesting
  standardized management in Italy, a retrospective study was performed to assess
  the diagnostic and therapeutic pathways of ACS in children. From 2013 to 2018, 208
  ACS episodes were presented by 122/583 kids in 11 centres. 73 were male, mean age
  10.9 years, 85% African, 92% HbSS or Sbeta . In our hub-and-spoke system, a good
  adherence to Guidelines was documented, but discrepancies between reference centres
  and general hospitals were noted. Improvement is needed for timely transfer to reference
  centres, use of incentive spirometry, oxygen therapy and pain management.'
