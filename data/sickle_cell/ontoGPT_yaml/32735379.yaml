input_text: "Vaso-occlusive crisis in a sickle cell patient after transfusion-transmitted
  dengue infection. CASE REPORT: A 26-year-old woman with sickle cell disease (SCD)
  on chronic transfusion therapy complained of severe arthralgia, myalgia, abdominal
  pain, headache, and fever 24 hours after transfusion of a red blood cells (RBCs).
  Dengue virus (DENV) infection was suspected and the patient was hospitalized for
  clinical support and RBC transfusion, to lower the hemoglobin S to less than 30%.
  The patient's clinical condition improved approximately 8 days after the onset of
  symptoms. RESULTS: DENV type 2 (DENV-2) TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction
  was negative in the patient's pretransfusion sample while the posttransfusion sample
  was positive (Ct, 27.8), suggesting a high viral load and an acute infection. To
  investigate DENV transfusion transmission (TT-DENV) the stored donor serum was tested
  and was also positive (Ct, 25.8). Molecular typing confirmed the presence of DENV-2.
  The phylogenetic analysis of the DENV-2 strains obtained from both donor and patient
  samples were classified as the Southeast Asia-American genotype (Genotype III) and
  demonstrated 100% genomic identity, indicating TT-DENV. CONCLUSION: This is the
  first description of TT-DENV in a SCD patient. A presumed high viral load in the
  transfused RBC unit probably determined the early clinical manifestation. In endemic
  regions dengue fever should be considered as differential diagnosis in SCD patients
  with fever and acute pain crisis, mainly during DENV outbreaks."
