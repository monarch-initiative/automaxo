input_text: 'A randomised controlled provider-blinded trial of community health workers
  in sickle cell anaemia: effects on haematologic variables and hydroxyurea adherence.
  Hydroxyurea (hydroxycarbamide) (HU) for sickle cell anaemia (SCA) is underutilised.
  Case management is an evidence-based health management strategy and in this regard
  patient navigators (PNs) may provide case management for SCA. We hypothesised that
  HU-eligible patients exposed to PNs would have improved indicators of starting HU
  and HU adherence. We randomised 224 HU-eligible SCA adults into the Start Healing
  in Patients with Hydroxyurea (SHIP-HU) Trial. All patients received care from trained
  physicians using standardised HU prescribing protocols. Patients in the Experimental
  arm received case management and education from PNs through multiple contacts. All
  other patients were regarded as the Control arm and received specialty care alone.
  Study physicians were blinded to the study arms and did not interact with PNs. At
  baseline, 6 and 12 months we assessed and compared laboratory parameters and HU
  adherence indicators. Experimental patients had higher 6-month mean fetal haemoglobin
  (HbF) levels than controls. But at 12 months, mean HbF was similar, as were white
  blood cell count, absolute neutrophil count, total haemoglobin, platelet count and
  mean corpuscular volume. At 12 months there were fewer experimental patients missing
  HU doses than controls (mean 1 8 vs. 4 5, P = 0 0098), and more recent HU prescriptions
  filled than for controls (mean 53 8 vs. 92 days, median 27 5 vs. 62 days, P = 0
  0082). Mean HU doses were largely similar. We detected behavioural improvements
  in HU adherence but no haematological improvements by adding PNs to specialty care.'
