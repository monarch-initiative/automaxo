input_text: Key Components of Pain Management for Children and Adults with Sickle
  Cell Disease. Sickle cell disease pain manifests as severe acute pain episodes and
  a debilitating chronic pain syndrome. Acute pain episodes are the most common reason
  for health care use; however, acute pain episodes are also frequently managed at
  home. Chronic pain syndrome develops in 30% to 40% of individuals with sickle cell
  disease, with an increasing incidence and severity with age. We review the critical
  aspects of pain management that are integral to the comprehensive approach to sickle
  cell disease pain and are rooted in the biopsychosocial model. The review focuses
  on opioid pharmacology and psychosocial comorbidities.
