input_text: 'A Healthcare Improvement Initiative to Increase Multidisciplinary Pain
  Management Referrals for Youth with Sickle Cell Disease. BACKGROUND: Chronic pain
  is a complex integration of biological, psychological, and social variables. Multidisciplinary
  pain management experts design interventions that treat the multidimensional experience.
  Children and adolescents with sickle cell disease (SCD) are at risk for chronic
  pain. Increased risk is associated with multiple characteristics including sickle
  cell genotype, age, gender, frequency of hospitalization, duration of hospitalization,
  and certain comorbid diagnoses. Referral to pain management professionals for this
  population is often delayed. AIMS: To increase multidisciplinary pain management
  referrals for youth with SCD identified to be at risk for chronic pain. DESIGN:
  Implementation research. SETTING: One pediatric, academic medical facility serving
  as a regional sickle cell treatment center in the Midwest. PARTICIPANTS: Children
  greater than 2 years of age and less than 21 years of age with laboratory confirmed
  SCD. METHODS: Implementation of an evidence-based screening tool using the consolidated
  framework for implementation research (CFIR) to guide project planning, design,
  and evaluation. The CFIR model was paired with the Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) quality
  improvement methodology to operationalize workflow and sustain project aims. RESULTS
  AND CONCLUSIONS: Eighty-four percent of all eligible patients were screened during
  their routine sickle cell appointments resulting in a 110% increase in multidisciplinary
  pain management referrals. Future interventions and PDSA cycles are targeted at
  improving attendance at scheduled appointments, reducing hospitalizations, decreasing
  30-day readmissions, and shortening length of stay.'

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  subject_extension: <A chemical or drug mentioned in the relationship between the medical action and the symptom, for example, "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  object_extension: <An optional term describing some specific aspect of the object, e.g. "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  subject: <The medical action. For example: blood transfusion, radiation therapy, cardiac catheterization, pulse oximetry, otoscopy>
  predicate: <The relationship type between the medical action and the symptom, usually TREATS or PREVENTS.>
  object: <A sign or symptom associated with the disease and targeted by the medical action. For example, Low serum calcitriol, hypoplasia of the thymus, chronic cough, aortic stiffness, low pulse pressure>
  qualifier: <The primary disease the relationship is about, or specifically the disease the symptom is related to. For example, Beck-Fahrner syndrome, hereditary retinoblastoma, progeria, diabetes mellitus, infectious otitis media>
  subject_qualifier: <An optional qualifier or modifier for the subject of the statement, e.g. "high dose" or "intravenously administered">
