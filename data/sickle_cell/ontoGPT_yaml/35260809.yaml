input_text: 'A population-based analysis of predictors of penile surgical intervention
  among inpatients with acute priapism. While consensus exists regarding risk factors
  for priapism, predictors of operative intervention are less well established. We
  assessed patient and hospital-level predictors associated with penile surgical intervention
  (PSI) for patients admitted with acute priapism, as well as length of stay (LOS)
  and total hospital charges using the National Inpatient Sample (2010-2015). Inpatients
  with acute priapism were stratified by PSI, defined as penile shunts, incisions,
  and placement of penile prostheses, exclusive of irrigation procedures. Survey-weighted
  logistic regression models were utilized to assess predictors of PSI. Negative binomial
  regression and generalized linear models with logarithmic transformation were used
  to compare PSI to LOS and total hospital charges, respectively. Among 14,529 weighted
  hospitalizations, 4,953 underwent PSI. Non-Medicare insurances, substance abuse,
  and >=3 Elixhauser comorbidities had increased odds of PSI. Conversely, Black patients,
  sickle cell disease, alcohol abuse, neurologic diseases, malignancies, and teaching
  hospitals had lower odds. PSI coincided with shorter median LOS (adjusted IRR: 0.62;
  p < 0.001) and lower ratio of the mean hospital charges (adjusted Ratio: 0.49; p
  < 0.001). Additional subgroup analysis revealed penile incisions and shunts primarily
  associated with reduced LOS (adjusted IRR: 0.66; p < 0.001) and total hospital charges
  (adjusted Ratio: 0.49; p < 0.001). Further work is required to understand predictors
  of poor outcomes in these populations.'
