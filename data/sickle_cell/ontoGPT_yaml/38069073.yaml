input_text: 'Drug Selection and Posology, Optimal Therapies and Risk/Benefit Assessment
  in Medicine: The Paradigm of Iron-Chelating Drugs.The design of clinical protocols
  and the selection of drugs with appropriate posology are critical parameters for
  therapeutic outcomes. Optimal therapeutic protocols could ideally be designed in
  all diseases including for millions of patients affected by excess iron deposition
  (EID) toxicity based on personalised medicine parameters, as well as many variations
  and limitations. EID is an adverse prognostic factor for all diseases and especially
  for millions of chronically red-blood-cell-transfused patients. Differences in iron
  chelation therapy posology cause disappointing results in neurodegenerative diseases
  at low doses, but lifesaving outcomes in thalassemia major (TM) when using higher
  doses. In particular, the transformation of TM from a fatal to a chronic disease
  has been achieved using effective doses of oral deferiprone (L1), which improved
  compliance and cleared excess toxic iron from the heart associated with increased
  mortality in TM. Furthermore, effective L1 and L1/deferoxamine combination posology
  resulted in the complete elimination of EID and the maintenance of normal iron store
  levels in TM. The selection of effective chelation protocols has been monitored
  by MRI T2* diagnosis for EID levels in different organs. Millions of other iron-loaded
  patients with sickle cell anemia, myelodysplasia and haemopoietic stem cell transplantation,
  or non-iron-loaded categories with EID in different organs could also benefit from
  such chelation therapy advances. Drawbacks of chelation therapy include drug toxicity
  in some patients and also the wide use of suboptimal chelation protocols, resulting
  in ineffective therapies. Drug metabolic effects, and interactions with other metals,
  drugs and dietary molecules also affected iron chelation therapy. Drug selection
  and the identification of effective or optimal dose protocols are essential for
  positive therapeutic outcomes in the use of chelating drugs in TM and other iron-loaded
  and non-iron-loaded conditions, as well as general iron toxicity.'
