input_text: 'Community based screening for sickle haemoglobin among pregnant women
  in Benue State, Nigeria: I-Care-to-Know, a Healthy Beginning Initiative.BACKGROUND:
  Haemoglobin genotype screening at prenatal care offers women an opportunity to be
  aware of their genotype, receive education on sickle cell disease (SCD) and may
  increase maternal demand for SCD newborn screening. In developed countries, most
  pregnant women who access prenatal care and deliver at the hospital receive haemoglobin
  genotype screening. In settings with low prenatal care attendance and low hospital
  deliveries, community-based screening may provide similar opportunity for pregnant
  women. We assessed the feasibility and acceptability of integrating haemoglobin
  genotype screening into an existing community-based HIV program. METHODS: Onsite
  community-based integrated testing for HIV, hepatitis B virus and haemoglobin electrophoresis,
  were conducted for pregnant women and their male partners. Community Health Advisors
  implementing the NIH and PEPFAR-supported Healthy Beginning Initiative (HBI) program
  provided education on SCD, collected blood sample for haemoglobin electrophoresis
  and provided test results to participants enrolled into the HBI program. We concurrently
  conducted a cross-sectional study using a pretested, semi-structured, interviewer
  administered questionnaire to collect demographic data and assess awareness of individual
  haemoglobin "genotype" among HBI pregnant women participants. RESULTS: In this study,
  99.9% (10,167/10,168) of pregnant women who received education on SCD accepted and
  completed the survey, had blood drawn for haemoglobin electrophoresis and received
  their results. A majority of participating pregnant women (97.0%) were not aware
  of their haemoglobin "genotype". Among the participants who were incorrect about
  their haemoglobin "genotype", 41.1% (23/56) of women who reported their haemoglobin
  "genotype" as AA were actually AS. The odds of haemoglobin "genotype" awareness
  was higher among participants who were in younger age group, completed tertiary
  education, had less number of pregnancies, and attended antenatal care. Overall
  prevalence of sickle cell trait (AS) was 18.7%. CONCLUSIONS: It is feasible to integrate
  haemoglobin "genotype" testing into an existing community-based maternal-child program.
  Most pregnant women who were unaware of their haemoglobin "genotype" accepted and
  had haemoglobin genotype testing, and received their test results. Increasing parental
  awareness of their own haemoglobin "genotype" could increase their likelihood of
  accepting newborn screening for SCD.'
