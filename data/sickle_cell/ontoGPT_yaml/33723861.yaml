input_text: Vasculo-toxic and pro-inflammatory action of unbound haemoglobin, haem
  and iron in transfusion-dependent patients with haemolytic anaemias. Increasing
  evidence suggests that free haem and iron exert vasculo-toxic and pro-inflammatory
  effects by activating endothelial and immune cells. In the present retrospective
  study, we compared serum samples from transfusion-dependent patients with beta-thalassaemia
  major and intermedia, hereditary spherocytosis and sickle cell disease (SCD). Haemolysis,
  transfusions and ineffective erythropoiesis contribute to haem and iron overload
  in haemolytic patients. In all cohorts we observed increased systemic haem and iron
  levels associated with scavenger depletion and toxic 'free' species formation. Endothelial
  dysfunction, oxidative stress and inflammation markers were significantly increased
  compared to healthy donors. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, oxidative
  stress markers remained significantly associated with both haem- and iron-related
  parameters, while soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (sVCAM-1), soluble endothelial
  selectin (sE-selectin) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) showed the strongest
  association with haem-related parameters and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule
  1 (sICAM-1), sVCAM-1, interleukin 6 (IL-6) and vascular endothelial growth factor
  (VEGF) with iron-related parameters. While hereditary spherocytosis was associated
  with the highest IL-6 and TNFalpha levels, beta-thalassaemia major showed limited
  inflammation compared to SCD. The sVCAM1 increase was significantly lower in patients
  with SCD receiving exchange compared to simple transfusions. The present results
  support the involvement of free haem/iron species in the pathogenesis of vascular
  dysfunction and sterile inflammation in haemolytic diseases, irrespective of the
  underlying haemolytic mechanism, and highlight the potential therapeutic benefit
  of iron/haem scavenging therapies in these conditions.
