  cell disease. BACKGROUND: Treating vaso-occlusive painful crises in people with
  sickle cell disease is complex and requires multiple interventions. Extra fluids
  are routinely given as adjunct treatment, regardless of the individual's state of
  hydration with the aim of slowing or stopping the sickling process and thereby alleviating
  pain. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. OBJECTIVES: To
  determine the optimal route, quantity and type of fluid replacement for people with
  sickle cell disease with acute painful crises. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane
  Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register which comprises of references
  identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant
  journals and abstract books of conference proceedings.We also conducted searches
  of Embase (November 2007), LILACS, www.ClinicalTrials.gov (05 January 2010), and
  the WHO ICTRP (30 June 2017).Date of most recent search of the Group's Haemoglobinopathies
  Trials Register: 16 February 2017. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and quasi-randomised
  controlled trials that compared the administration of supplemental fluids adjunctive
  to analgesics by any route in people with any type of sickle cell disease during
  an acute painful episode, under medical supervision (inpatient, day care or community).
  DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: No relevant trials have yet been identified. MAIN
  RESULTS: Sixteen trials were identified by the searches, all of which were not eligible
  for inclusion in the review. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Treating vaso-occlusive crises
  is complex and requires multiple interventions. Extra fluids, generally oral or
  intravenous, are routinely administered during acute painful episodes to people
  with sickle cell disease regardless of the individual's state of hydration. Reports
  of their use during these acute painful episodes do not state the efficacy of any
  single route, type or quantity of fluid compared to another. However, there are
  no randomised controlled trials that have assessed the safety and efficacy of different
  routes, types or quantities of fluid. This systematic review identifies the need
  for a multicentre randomised controlled trial assessing the efficacy and possible
  adverse effects of different routes, types and quantities of fluid administered
  to people with sickle cell disease during acute painful episodes."
