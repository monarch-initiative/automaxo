input_text: Lentiviral and genome-editing strategies for the treatment of beta-hemoglobinopathies.
  beta-Thalassemia and sickle cell disease (SCD) are the most prevalent monogenic
  diseases. These disorders are caused by quantitative or qualitative defects in the
  production of adult hemoglobin. Gene therapy is a potential treatment option for
  patients lacking an allogenic compatible hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) donor. New-generation
  lentiviral vectors (LVs) carrying a beta-globin-like gene have revolutionized this
  field by allowing effective HSC transduction, with no evidence of genotoxicity to
  date. Several clinical trials with different types of vector are underway worldwide;
  the initial results are encouraging with regard to the sustained production of therapeutic
  hemoglobin, improved biological parameters, a lower transfusion requirement, and
  better quality of life. Long-term follow-up studies will confirm the safety of LV-based
  gene therapy. The optimization of patient conditioning, HSC harvesting, and HSC
  transduction has further improved the therapeutic potential of this approach. Novel
  LV-based strategies for reactivating endogenous fetal hemoglobin (HbF) are also
  promising, because elevated HbF levels can reduce the severity of both beta-thalassemia
  and SCD. Lastly, genome-editing approaches designed to correct the disease-causing
  mutation or reactivate HbF are currently under investigation. Here, we discuss the
  clinical outcomes of current LV-based gene addition trials and the promising advantages
  of novel alternative therapeutic strategies.
