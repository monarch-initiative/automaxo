input_text: 'Screening for new red blood cell alloantibodies after transfusion in
  patients with sickle cell disease. BACKGROUND: Patients with sickle cell disease
  (SCD) are frequent recipients of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions and are at risk
  for RBC alloimmunization. RBC alloimmunization is diagnosed by identifying RBC alloantibodies
  as part of pre-transfusion testing, but this testing fails to detect alloantibodies
  that have evanesced. It may be beneficial to screen for new RBC alloantibody development
  after transfusion before possible antibody evanescence. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS:
  Our institution started a new initiative for episodically transfused patients with
  SCD to obtain at least one antibody screen 2-6 months after transfusion as part
  of their clinical care. A database was created to prospectively track all transfused
  patients for 1 year and their post-transfusion antibody screen results. Patients
  received prophylactically CEK-matched RBC units. RESULTS: During the study year,
  138 patients with SCD received a total of 242 RBC transfusions. Patients with a
  history of an RBC alloantibody (n = 13, 9.4%) had previously received more RBC units
  than non alloimmunized patients (median 11 vs. 2 RBC units, p = .0002). A total
  of 337 post-transfusion antibody screens were obtained in 127 patients (92.0%) with
  110 patients (79.7%) having at least one antibody screen 2-6 months post-transfusion.
  With this prospective testing, two new RBC alloantibodies (anti-C and -M) were identified
  in two patients. CONCLUSION: It is feasible to test for new RBC alloantibody development
  in most episodically transfused patients with SCD as part of their routine care.
  The yield of this screening appears low with CEK matching, but it could still provide
  important information for individual patients.'
