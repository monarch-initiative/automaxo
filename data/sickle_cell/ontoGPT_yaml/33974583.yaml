input_text: "Maintenance of a High Influenza Vaccination Rate and Improvement in Health
  Outcomes in a Pediatric Sickle Cell Disease Clinic. BACKGROUND: Children with sickle
  cell disease (SCD) are at high-risk of complications from influenza and should receive
  an influenza vaccination seasonally. Despite this recommendation, vaccination rates
  remain suboptimal. Boston Medical Center (BMC) previously achieved high influenza
  vaccination rates among its pediatric patients with SCD. The purpose of this study
  was to determine whether this high vaccination rate has been maintained and whether
  it has influenced outcome measures. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective chart
  review was conducted in the hematology clinic at an urban, academic medical center.
  Fisher's exact test and the independent samples t test were used to determine if
  there were any significant differences in characteristics between patients with
  influenza and patients without influenza, as well as between vaccinated and unvaccinated
  patients. Influenza vaccination rate, influenza-related hospitalization rate, and
  influenza-positive rate were collected and compared with reported rates. RESULTS:
  Data from 124 pediatric patients with SCD were examined. The influenza vaccination
  rate for pediatric patients with SCD at BMC (90.32%) was higher than previous studies
  that were not conducted at BMC, while BMC's influenza-related hospitalization rate
  (0) and influenza-positive rate (4.84%) were lower than other studies. Subjects
  who contracted influenza were younger than those who did not (4.67 vs. 10.03 y,
  P=0.005). CONCLUSIONS: BMC has maintained a high influenza vaccination rate among
  pediatric patients with SCD. BMC's vaccination strategy has been successful at improving
  outcome measures including rates of influenza and influenza hospitalizations without
  requiring additional staff. Such efforts should be replicated at other centers."
