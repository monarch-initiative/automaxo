input_text: 'Emergency red cell exchange for the management of acute complications
  in sickle cell disease: Automated versus manual. BACKGROUND: Red blood cell exchange
  is the cornerstone of the management for acute complications of sickle cell disease.
  It improves anaemia and improvesperipheral tissue oxygen delivery while at the same
  time reduces the proportion of circulating sickle erythrocytes. Even though automated
  red cell exchange is very effective in rapidly lowering the Hb S level, 24-h availability
  is currently not feasible for most specialist centres including our own. OBJECTIVE:
  Here, we describe our experience using both automated and manual red cell exchange
  for the management of acute sickle cell complications. METHODS: Eighty-six such
  episodes have been recorded between June 2011 and June 2022 comprising of 68 episodes
  of automated and 18 episodes of manual red cell exchange. RESULTS: The post procedure
  Hb S/S + C level was 18% after automated and 36% after manual red cell exchange.
  The platelet count dropped by 41% and 21% after automated and manual red cell exchange
  respectively. The clinical outcomes including need for organ support, duration of
  stay in the intensive care unit and overall length of hospitalisation was comparable
  between the two groups. CONCLUSION: In our experience, manual red cell exchange
  is a safe and effective alternative to an automated procedure that can be used while
  specialist centres are building up their capacity to offer automated red cell exchange
  for all patients requiring the intervention.'
