input_text: Brain injury pathophysiology study by a multimodal approach in children
  with sickle cell anemia with no intra or extra cranial arteriopathy.Despite its
  high prevalence in children with sickle cell anemia (SCA), the pathophysiology of
  silent cerebral infarcts (SCI) remains elusive. The main objective of this study
  was to explore the respective roles of major determinants of brain perfusion in
  SCA children with no past or current history of intracranial or extracranial vasculopathy.
  We used a multimodal approach based notably on perfusion imaging arterial spin labeling
  (ASL) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and near infra-red spectroscopy (NIRS), as
  well as biomarkers reflecting blood rheology and endothelial activation. Out of
  59 SCA patients (mean age 11.4+-3.9 yrs), eight (13%) had a total of 12 SCI. Children
  with SCI had a distinctive profile characterized by decreased blood pressure, impaired
  blood rheology, increased P-selectin levels, and marked anemia. Although ASL perfusion
  and oximetry values did not differ between groups, comparison of biological and
  clinical parameters according to the level of perfusion categorized in terciles
  showed an independent association between high perfusion and increased sP-selectin,
  decreased red blood cell deformability, low hemoglobin F level, increased blood
  viscosity and no a-thalassemia deletion. NIRS measurements did not yield additional
  novel results. Altogether, these findings argue for early MRI detection of SCI in
  children with no identified vasculopathy and suggest a potential role for ASL as
  an additional screening tool. Early treatment targeting hemolysis, anemia and endothelial
  dysfunction should reduce the risk of this under diagnosed and serious complication.
