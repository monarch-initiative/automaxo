input_text: Managing pregnancy in patients with sickle cell disease from a transfusion
  perspective. Advances in the management of sickle cell disease (SCD) have made it
  possible for most female patients (whether homozygous or compound heterozygous)
  to reach childbearing age and become pregnant. However, even in the less symptomatic
  forms of SCD a high risk of complications during pregnancy and the postpartum period
  can occur for both the mother (1% to 2% mortality) and the fetus. Coordinated care
  from the obstetrician and the sickle cell disease expert is essential, together
  with the active participation of the patient. Vaso-occlusive complications, such
  as vaso-occlusive crisis and acute chest syndrome, often increase in frequency when
  hydroxyurea treatment is interrupted. Obstetric complications, such as pre-eclampsia,
  fetal growth restriction, and preterm delivery, are more common in women with SCD.
  Recent meta-analysis-based studies support prophylactic transfusion. However, there
  have been no randomized trials assessing the benefits of prophylactic transfusion.
  Given the known risk of transfusion complications, including delayed hemolytic transfusion
  reaction and hyperhemolysis, transfusion is not systematically performed in pregnant
  women with SCD. We describe here a case-by-case approach to the management of pregnancy
  in women with SCD based on the medical and transfusion history of each patient.
