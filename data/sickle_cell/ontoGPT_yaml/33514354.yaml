input_text: 'Severe COVID-19 with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in a
  sickle cell disease adult patient: case report. BACKGROUND: Sickle-cell anaemia
  is a widespread genetic disease prevalent worldwide among African and African-American
  populations. The pathogenesis is most often revealed by pulmonary conditions, including
  acute thoracic syndrome, which is affecting the life expectancy of these populations.
  The global spread of CoV2-SARS infection with a respiratory tropism, endothelial
  damages and procoagulant status endangers the SCD population. However, with only
  a few case reports, consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic on SCD population remain
  poorly known. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 33-year-old man with a history
  of homozygous SS homozygous sickle cell anemia who consulted on March 24, 2020 for
  febrile dyspnea 11 days after the onset of symptoms. A nasopharyngeal swab was positive
  for SARS-CoV-2. His respiratory status worsened rapidly in the emergency room and
  then in ICU leading to severe ARDS requiring intubation, curarization, and venovenous
  ECMO. Hematologically, severe hemolysis associated with major thrombocytopenia without
  documented spinal cord injury was noted. Several transfusion exchanges are performed.
  The evolution was finally slowly favorable and led to discharge from the intensive
  care unit and then from the hospital. CONCLUSIONS: This case recalls the importance
  of an increased prevention policy against COVID-19among the SCD population. In addition,
  from a therapeutic point of view, it advocates (1) a high preventive anticoagulation
  from the outset according to the level of D-dimers (2) the use of venovenous ECMO
  in this particular case, whereas this technique has had rather disappointing results
  in acute chest syndromes. (3) Unexpectedly, our patient did not develop pulmonary
  arterial hypertension (PAH) and acute cor pulmonale (ACP), whereas this is a common
  feature of ARDS during SCD. These last two observations suggest a different pathophysiology
  of pulmonary disorders in SCD patients in the case of SARS COv2. It could be associated
  with marked hypoxemia secondary to pulmonary vascular vasodilation.'
