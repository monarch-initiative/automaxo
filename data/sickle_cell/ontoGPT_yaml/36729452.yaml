input_text: "Severe Maternal Morbidity and Mortality in Sickle Cell Disease in the
  National Inpatient Sample, 2012-2018.Importance: Pregnancy outcomes are historically
  poor among people with sickle cell disease (SCD) in the US, most of whom have Black
  race. Whether outcomes have improved is unknown. Objective: To tabulate adverse
  pregnancy outcomes among patients with SCD, comparing outcomes of deliveries among
  Black people with SCD with those of Black people without SCD and a control non-Black
  population, and to measure the association of racial disparities with adverse outcomes
  in SCD pregnancies. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study
  was a secondary analysis involving data from National Inpatient Sample, a nationally
  representative sample of 20% of acute hospital admissions in the US, between 2012
  and 2018. The data set included all admissions with codes for delivery of a pregnancy
  among people aged 11 to 55 years. Data were analyzed from September 2021 to August
  2022. Exposures: SCD, racial disparities. Main Outcomes and Measures: Severe maternal
  morbidity (SMM) as measured by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's
  index alongside other outcomes; multiple logistic regression was used to compare
  the odds for adverse pregnancy outcomes. Results: The sample included 5 401 899
  deliveries, including 3901 deliveries among people with SCD and 742 164 deliveries
  among people with Black race. Compared with the non-Black control group, patients
  with SCD and Black patients were younger (mean [SD] age: SCD, 27.2 [5.9] years;
  Black, 27.1 [6.1] years vs 28.7 [5.9] years) and more likely to have public insurance
  (SCD, 2609 deliveries [67.3%]; Black, 496 828 deliveries [65.4%] vs 1 880 198 deliveries
  [40.8%]). The maternal mortality rate in deliveries among people with SCD was 26
  times greater than in the non-Black control group and more than 10 times greater
  than among Black pregnant people without SCD (Per 10 000 deliveries: SCD 13.3; 95%
  CI, 5.7-31.2; Black race, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.0-1.5; non-Black control 0.5; 95% CI, 0.5-0.6).
  Compared with the control group, SCD deliveries had higher odds of SMM (adjusted
  odds ratio [aOR], 7.22; 95% CI, 6.25-8.34; P < .001), especially cerebrovascular
  events (aOR, 22.00; 95% CI, 15.25-31.72; P < .001) and thromboembolism (aOR, 17.34;
  95% CI, 11.55-26.03; P < .001). Racial disparities explained a median (IQR) 28.9%
  (21.2%-33.1%) of the increased risk in deliveries to people with SCD and between
  40% and 50% of the increased risk for acute kidney failure (excess risk [ER], 56.9%;
  95% CI, 54.3%-59.3%), intrauterine fetal demise (ER, 47.8%; 95% CI, 46.6%-49.1%),
  and eclampsia (ER, 42.1%; 95% CI, 37.9%-46.1%). Conclusions and Relevance: In this
  large cross-sectional study of pregnancy outcomes in people with SCD, the risk for
  SMM was higher compared with deliveries among people without SCD, especially for
  thrombotic events, organ failure, and death. Racial disparities were associated
  with adverse outcomes. Our findings compel scientific, clinical, and political effort
  to improve outcomes for pregnant people with SCD."
