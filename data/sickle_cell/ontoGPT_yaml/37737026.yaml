input_text: 'Prevalence of Pediatric Masked Hypertension and Risk of Subclinical Cardiovascular
  Outcomes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.Masked hypertension (MH) occurs
  when office blood pressure is normal, but hypertension is confirmed using out-of-office
  blood pressure measures. Hypertension is a risk factor for subclinical cardiovascular
  outcomes, including left ventricular hypertrophy, increased left ventricular mass
  index, carotid intima media thickness, and pulse wave velocity. However, the risk
  factors for ambulatory blood pressure monitoring defined MH and its association
  with subclinical cardiovascular outcomes are unclear. A systematic literature search
  on 9 databases included English publications from 1974 to 2023. Pediatric MH prevalence
  was stratified by disease comorbidities and compared with the general pediatric
  population. We also compared the prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy, and
  mean differences in left ventricular mass index, carotid intima media thickness,
  and pulse wave velocity between MH versus normotensive pediatric patients. Of 2199
  screened studies, 136 studies (n=28 612; ages 4-25 years) were included. The prevalence
  of MH in the general pediatric population was 10.4% (95% CI, 8.00-12.80). Compared
  with the general pediatric population, the risk ratio (RR) of MH was significantly
  greater in children with coarctation of the aorta (RR, 1.91), solid-organ or stem-cell
  transplant (RR, 2.34), chronic kidney disease (RR, 2.44), and sickle cell disease
  (RR, 1.33). MH patients had increased risk of subclinical cardiovascular outcomes
  compared with normotensive patients, including higher left ventricular mass index
  (mean difference, 3.86 g/m2.7 [95% CI, 2.51-5.22]), left ventricular hypertrophy
  (odds ratio, 2.44 [95% CI, 1.50-3.96]), and higher pulse wave velocity (mean difference,
  0.30 m/s [95% CI, 0.14-0.45]). The prevalence of MH is significantly elevated among
  children with various comorbidities. Children with MH have evidence of subclinical
  cardiovascular outcomes, which increases their risk of long-term cardiovascular
  disease.'
