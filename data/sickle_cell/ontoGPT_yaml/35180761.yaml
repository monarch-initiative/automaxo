input_text: Introduction of Hydroxyurea Therapy to a Cohort of Sickle Cell Patients
  in Northern Haiti. Although the prevalence of sickle cell anemia is high in Haiti,
  treatment with hydroxyurea (HU) is uncommon. HU therapy was started at a hospital
  in Northern Haiti for children and young adults who had presented with complications
  of their disease. The patients were followed in clinic for their response to therapy
  and the principal outcome was hospitalization for complications. There was a 70%
  decrease in the rate of hospitalization in the cohort with no significant complications
  or deaths during the study period. Treatment with HU is a proven therapy that reduces
  the morbidity associated with sickle cell anemia and efforts should be made to assure
  access and affordability in regions with a high prevalence.
