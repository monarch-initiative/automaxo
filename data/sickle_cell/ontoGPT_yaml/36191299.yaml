input_text: 'Subanesthetic ketamine: the way forward for pain management in sickle
  cell disease patients? INTRODUCTION: Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) present
  recurrent episodes of acute pain, the hallmark of the disease, and some will also
  develop chronic pain. Currently, the treatment of SCD acute pain only targets its
  symptoms, rather than underlying mechanisms, and is directed by expert and consensus
  guidelines. AREAS COVERED: While opioids remain the mainstay of therapy for acute
  pain and are also used to treat SCD-related chronic pain, in some patients, opioids
  are ineffective or are associated with severe undesirable side effects. In those
  instances, clinicians caring for patients with SCD face an unmet need for effective
  non-opioid analgesics. Recently, the use of subanesthetic ketamine has been explored
  as a strategy to meet this need. While definitive evidence of its efficacy is lacking,
  some information exists suggesting that subanesthetic ketamine improves pain control
  and may have opioid-sparing effects in SCD-related acute pain. However, ketamine
  can also yield undesirable psychotomimetic and cardiovascular effects. EXPERT OPINION:
  After weighing potential risks and benefits, in the absence of better alternatives
  and in settings where it can be administered safely, ketamine may be a reasonable
  option for patients with SCD-related acute refractory pain.'
