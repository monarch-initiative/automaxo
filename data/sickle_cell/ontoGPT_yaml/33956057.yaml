input_text: "Disease severity impacts plerixafor-mobilized stem cell collection in
  patients with sickle cell disease. Recent studies suggest that plerixafor mobilization
  and apheresis in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) is safe and can allow collection
  of sufficient CD34+ hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) collection for clinical gene therapy
  applications. However, the quantities of plerixafor-mobilized CD34+ cells vary between
  different SCD patients for unknown reasons. Twenty-three participants with SCD underwent
  plerixafor mobilization followed by apheresis, processing, and HSC enrichment under
  a phase 1 safety and efficacy study conducted at 2 institutions. Linear regression
  or Spearman's correlation test was used to assess the relationships between various
  hematologic and clinical parameters with total CD34+ cells/kg collected. Median
  CD34+ cells/kg after 2 or fewer mobilization and apheresis cycles was 4.0 x 106
  (range, 1.5-12.0). Similar to what is observed generally, CD34+ yield correlated
  negatively with age (P < .001) and positively with baseline (P = .003) and preapheresis
  blood CD34+ cells/microL (P < .001), and baseline white blood cell (P = .01) and
  platelet counts (P = .03). Uniquely for SCD, CD34+ cell yields correlated positively
  with the number of days hydroxyurea was held (for up to 5 weeks, P = .01) and negatively
  with markers of disease severity, including hospitalization frequency within the
  preceding year (P = .01) and the number of medications taken for chronic pain (P
  = .002). Unique SCD-specific technical challenges in apheresis were also associated
  with reduced CD34+ cell collection efficiency and purification. Here, we describe
  factors that impact plerixafor mobilization success in patients with SCD, confirming
  known factors as described in other populations in addition to reporting previously
  unknown disease specific factors in patients with SCD. This trial was registered
  at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT03226691."
