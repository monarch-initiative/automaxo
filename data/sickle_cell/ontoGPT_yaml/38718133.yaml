input_text: 'Nothing about us without us: Advocacy and engagement in genetic medicine.
  The development of new genetic medicines to treat sickle cell disease highlights
  the need for greater collaboration between researchers and people with lived experiences.
  Drawing on the adage "Nothing about us, without us," we call for increased investments
  in community advocacy and engagement.'
