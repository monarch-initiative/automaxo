input_text: "Incidence and Risk Factors of Pain Crisis After Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation
  for Sickle Cell Disease. Vaso-occlusive episodes (VOC) or pain crises are the commonest
  indications for hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for sickle cell disease
  (SCD). Elimination of pain crisis post-HCT is an important patient-centered outcome
  and may improve understanding of the natural history of pain syndromes in SCD. We
  examined de-identified records of 763 patients followed for a median of 36.7 months
  (0.3-168.6) with 69.6% patient's age at HCT <18 years, 83.3% patient's Karnofsky-Lansky
  Performance (KPS) score >= 90, overall survival 92.9%, event-free survival 72.4%,
  graft failure (GF) 22.4%, AGVHD 21.4%, CGVHD 27%, and pain crisis 8.65%. On unadjusted
  logistic regression, increased risk of pain crisis post-HCT was observed in patients
  with age at HCT >10 years (11-17 years [OR=9.43; 95% CI: 3.20, 27.79, p<0.0001],
  age >= 18 years [ OR=16.62; 95% CI: 5.85, 47.16, p<0.0001]), history of pain crisis
  2 years before HCT [OR= 13.16, 95% CI: 4.08, 42.42, p<0.0001], alternate donors
  (haploidentical [OR= 4.80; 95% CI: 2.48, 9.31, p<0.0001], unrelated matched [OR=
  2.71; 95% CI: 1.23, 5.97, p=0.0132], and mismatched unrelated [OR= 3.19; 95% CI:
  1.44, 7.05, p=0.0041], and with GF [n= 41(5.37%), OR = 7.15; 95% CI: 4.20, 12.18.,
  p<0.0001]. Pain crisis was less frequent with KPS >=90 [OR = 0.31; 95% CI: 0.18,
  0.55, p<0.0001]. Multivariable logistic regression models confirmed age at HCT,
  KPS, graft type, donor type, history of VOC 2 yearspre-HCT, and GF as independent
  predictors of pain crisis post-HCT and generated predictive models and nomograms
  for pain crisis post-HCT for SCD which can support shared decision-making."
