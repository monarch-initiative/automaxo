input_text: "Evaluating Consistency of Documented ICD Codes for Hospitalized Patients
  With Sickle Cell Disease.OBJECTIVES: Conducting health services research relies
  on consistent diagnosis code documentation; however, it is unknown if consistent
  documentation in claims data occurs among patients with sickle cell disease (SCD)
  and/or trait (SCT). The objective of this study was to examine the consistency of
  International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code documentation for SCD/SCT and
  identify coding discrepancies between patients' hospitalizations. PATIENTS: A total
  of 80 031 hospitalization records across 528 hospitals belonging to 15 380 unique
  patients who had at least 1 documentation of SCD/SCT and 2 or more hospitalizations
  during the study period (April 2015-December 2016). METHODS: Secondary analysis
  of patient discharge abstracts in California, Florida, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.
  ICD 9 and ICD 10 codes identified patients with SCD/SCT. Variations in documentation
  consistency across hospitals were examined. RESULTS: Only 51% of patients were consistently
  documented. There were statistically significant differences in whether a patient
  was or was not consistently documented based on: age, race/ethnicity, sex, insurer,
  and disease type. Twenty-five percent of hospitalization records were not consistently
  documented with an SCD code. Hospitalization records, for patients not consistently
  documented (49%), often included primary admitting diagnoses for conditions associated
  with SCD. Few hospitals (18%) were above average in consistently documenting SCD/SCT.
  CONCLUSIONS: Not consistent documentation for SCD/SCT occurs with variation among
  patients and across disease type and hospitals. These findings signal to researchers
  the importance of thoroughly identifying all hospitalizations when studying populations
  with chronic disease. Without accurate documentation, research relying on claims
  data may produce inaccurate findings."
