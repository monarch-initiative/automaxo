input_text: Preferences for potential benefits and risks for gene therapy in the treatment
  of sickle cell disease.Objective is to quantify benefit-risk tradeoffs pertaining
  to potential gene therapies among adults and parents/caregivers of children with
  sickle-cell disease (SCD). A discrete-choice experiment (DCE) survey was developed
  in which respondents selected their preferred treatment alternatives in a series
  of experimentally-controlled pairs of hypothetical gene therapies and a "no gene
  therapy" option. Gene therapy alternatives were defined based on the chance of eliminating
  SCD symptoms, expected increases in life expectancy they could offer, treatment-related
  risk of death and potential increases in lifetime cancer risk. Respondents made
  selections based on their current disease severity and in the context of expectations
  of worsened disease. Three clinical sites and one patient organization recruited
  174 adult patients and 109 parents of children with SCD to complete the survey.
  Adult and parent respondents were generally willing to choose gene therapies, but
  the adults required higher expected levels of efficacy (i.e., higher chance of eliminating
  symptoms) than parents to choose gene therapies that conferred mortality risks of
  10% or more. When adults and parents of children with less severe symptoms were
  asked to consider scenarios of higher levels of disease severity, the risk tolerance
  increased, and the lowest acceptable level of efficacy for gene therapies with mortality
  risks dropped by more than 50%. Baseline SCD symptoms are a major driver of gene
  therapy acceptability. Adults and parents of patients with milder symptoms may prefer
  other treatment options; however, an expectation of symptoms deterioration triggers
  strong reassessment of the acceptable benefit-risk balance of this novel technology.
