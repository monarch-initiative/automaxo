input_text: 'Sickle Cell Disease in an Older Adult Population: A Retrospective Review
  of Health Care Resource Utilization. Sickle cell disease (SCD) has a history of
  health inequity, as patients with SCD are primarily Black and often marginalized
  from the health care system. Although recent health care and treatment advancements
  have prolonged life expectancy, it may be insufficient to support the complex needs
  of the growing population of older adults with SCD. This retrospective study used
  a cohort (N = 812) of Medicare Advantage beneficiaries 45 years and older (ages:
  45-54, 55-64, 65-74, 75-89) with SCD to identify associations of SCD-related complications
  and comorbidities with emergency department (ED) visits, potentially avoidable ED
  visits, all-cause hospitalization, and potentially avoidable hospitalizations, 2018-2020.
  The 75-89 age group had lower odds of an ED visit (OR 0.56; 95% CI 0.32-1.00), 65-74
  age group had lower odds of an ED visit (OR 0.49; 95% CI 0.31-0.78) and hospitalization
  (OR 0.50; 95% CI 0.31-0.79), compared with the 45-54 age group. Acute chest syndrome
  was associated with increased odds of an ED visit (OR 2.02; 95% CI 1.10-3.71), avoidable
  ED visit (OR 1.87; 95% CI 1.14-3.06), and hospitalization (OR 3.61; 95% CI 2.06-6.31).
  Pain was associated with increased odds of an ED visit (OR 2.64; 95% CI 1.85-3.76),
  an avoidable ED visit (OR 3.08; 95% CI 1.90-4.98), hospitalization (OR 1.51; 95%
  CI 1.02-2.24), and avoidable hospitalization (OR 6.42; 95% CI 1.74-23.74). Older
  adults with SCD have been living with SCD for decades, often while managing pain
  crises and complications associated increased incidence of an ED visit and hospitalization.
  The characteristics and needs of this population must continue to be examined to
  increase preventative care and reduce costly emergent health care resource utilization.'
