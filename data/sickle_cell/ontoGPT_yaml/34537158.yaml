input_text: 'Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine Special Statement: Beyond the scalpel:
  in utero fetal gene therapy and curative medicine. With the recent advances in gene
  editing with systems such as CRISPR-Cas9, precise genome editing in utero is on
  the horizon. Sickle cell disease is an excellent candidate for in utero fetal gene
  therapy, because the disease is monogenic, causes irreversible harm, and has life-limiting
  morbidity. Gene therapy has recently been proven to be effective in an adolescent
  patient. Several hurdles still impede the progress for fetal gene therapy in humans,
  including an incomplete understanding of the fetal immune system, unclear maternal
  immune responses to in utero gene therapy, risks of off-target effects from gene
  editing, gestational age constraints, and ethical questions surrounding fetal genetic
  intervention. However, none of these barriers appears insurmountable, and the journey
  to in utero gene therapy for sickle cell disease and other conditions should be
  well underway.'
