input_text: 'Case Ascertainment of Sickle Cell Disease Using Surveillance or Single
  Administrative Database Case Definitions.OBJECTIVE: In the absence of access to
  surveillance system data, single-source administrative databases are often used
  to study health care utilization and health outcomes among people with sickle cell
  disease (SCD). We compared the case definitions from single-source administrative
  databases with a surveillance case definition to identify people with SCD. MATERIALS
  AND METHODS: We used data from Sickle Cell Data Collection programs in California
  and Georgia (2016-2018). The surveillance case definition for SCD developed for
  the Sickle Cell Data Collection programs uses multiple databases, including newborn
  screening, discharge databases, state Medicaid programs, vital records, and clinic
  data. Case definitions for SCD in single-source administrative databases varied
  by database (Medicaid and discharge) and years of data (1, 2, and 3 years). We calculated
  the proportion of people meeting the surveillance case definition for SCD that was
  captured by each single administrative database case definition for SCD, by birth
  cohort, sex, and Medicaid enrollment. RESULTS: In California, 7117 people met the
  surveillance case definition of SCD from 2016 through 2018; 48% of this group was
  captured by the Medicaid case definition and 41% by the discharge case definition.
  In Georgia, 10 448 people met the surveillance case definition of SCD from 2016
  through 2018; 45% of this group was captured by the Medicaid case definition and
  51% by the discharge case definition. These proportions differed by years of data,
  birth cohort, and length of Medicaid enrollment. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: The surveillance
  case definition identified twice as many people with SCD as the single-source administrative
  database definitions during the same period, but trade-offs exist in using single
  administrative databases for decisions on policy and program expansion for SCD.'
