input_text: Utility of hemoglobin electrophoresis to distinguish between severe delayed
  hemolytic transfusion reaction versus hyperhemolysis syndrome. Delayed hemolytic
  transfusion reaction (DHTR) and hyperhemolysis syndrome (HHS) are both complications
  of red blood cell transfusions in patients with sickle cell disease.Clinically,
  both present with hemolysis and can be difficult to differentiate. Hemoglobin electrophoresis
  may aid in the diagnosis. Herein we describe a case in which a patient with hemoglobin
  SC disease presented with features of severe hemolysis several days after initiation
  of red blood cell exchange. Increase in reticulocyte count and complete absence
  of hemoglobin A on electrophoresis during this event supported the diagnosis of
  severe DHTR, indicating a rapid and selective destruction of the transfused red
  blood cells. Ability to interpret the hemoglobin electrophoresis can help clinicians
  distinguish between these two severe transfusion complications in patients living
  with sickle cell disease. It is important to identify the presence or absence of
  concomitant HHS, as patients with HHS tend to have a worse prognosis and there is
  a higher rate of recurrence of HHS with subsequent transfusions. Accurate diagnosis
  can lead to prompt management and decrease morbidity and mortality.
