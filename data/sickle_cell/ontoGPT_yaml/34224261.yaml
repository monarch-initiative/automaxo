input_text: "Treatment of Acute Pain in Adults With Sickle Cell Disease in an Infusion
  Center Versus the Emergency Department : A Multicenter Prospective Cohort Study.
  BACKGROUND: Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) have vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs).
  Infusion centers (ICs) are alternatives to emergency department (ED) care and may
  improve patient outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether care in ICs or EDs leads
  to better outcomes for the treatment of uncomplicated VOCs. DESIGN: Prospective
  cohort. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02411396). SETTING: 4 U.S. sites, with recruitment
  between April 2015 and December 2016. PARTICIPANTS: Adults with SCD living within
  60 miles of a study site. MEASUREMENTS: Participants were followed for 18 months
  after enrollment. Outcomes of interest were time to first dose of parenteral pain
  medication, whether pain reassessment was completed within 30 minutes after the
  first dose, and patient disposition on discharge from the acute care visit. Treatment
  effects for ICs versus EDs were estimated using a time-varying propensity score
  adjustment. RESULTS: Researchers enrolled 483 participants; the 269 who had acute
  care visits on weekdays are included in this report. With inverse probability of
  treatment-weighted adjustment, the mean time to first dose was 62 minutes in ICs
  and 132 minutes in EDs; the difference was 70 minutes (95% CI, 54 to 98 minutes;
  E-value, 2.8). The probability of pain reassessment within 30 minutes of the first
  dose of parenteral pain medication was 3.8 times greater (CI, 2.63 to 5.64 times
  greater; E-value, 4.7) in the IC than the ED. The probability that a participant's
  visit would end in admission to the hospital was smaller by a factor of 4 (0.25
  [CI, 0.18 to 0.33]) with treatment in an IC versus an ED. LIMITATION: The study
  was restricted to participants with uncomplicated VOCs. CONCLUSION: In adults with
  SCD having a VOC, treatment in an IC is associated with substantially better outcomes
  than treatment in an ED. PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: Patient-Centered Outcomes Research
