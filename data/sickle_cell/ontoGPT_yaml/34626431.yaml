input_text: "Exercise-induced changes of vital signs in adults with sickle cell disease.The
  six-minute walk test (6MWT) has been used in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD),
  in conjunction with tricuspid regurgitant velocity (TRV) and plasma N-terminal pro-brain
  natriuretic peptide (NT-pro BNP), to assess risk of having pulmonary hypertension.
  Exercise-induced vital sign changes (VSCs) are predictors of clinical outcomes in
  other diseases. In this study, we assess the predictors and prognostic value of
  6MWT VSC in adult SCD patients. Data from a multinational study of SCD patients
  (Treatment of Pulmonary Hypertension with Sildenafil: walk-PHaSST) were used to
  calculate the 6MWT VSC. Predictors of VSC were identified by a multivariable analysis,
  and a survival analysis was conducted by the Cox proportional hazard method. An
  increase in heart rate was observed in 90% of the 630 SCD adults, 77% of patients
  had an increase in systolic blood pressure (SBP), and 50% of patients had a decrease
  in oxygen saturation. TRV (odds ratio [OR] = 1.82, p = .020), absolute reticulocyte
  count (OR = 1.03, p < .001), and hemoglobin (OR = 0.99, p = .035) predicted oxygen
  desaturation >= 3% during the 6MWT. In the adjusted analysis, SBP increase during
  the 6MWT was associated with improved survival (hazards ratio = 0.3, 95% confidence
  interval: 0.1-0.8). Increases in heart rate and blood pressure, as well as oxygen
  desaturation, are common in adults with SCD during the 6MWT. VSC is associated with
  markers of anemia and TRV and can be used for risk stratification. Any increase
  in SBP during the 6MWT was associated with improved survival and may be indicative
  of a patient's ability to increase stroke volume."
