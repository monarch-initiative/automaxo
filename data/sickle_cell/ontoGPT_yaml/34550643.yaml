input_text: How I approach disease-modifying therapy in children with sickle cell
  disease in an era of novel therapies. Finally,after decades of stagnation, the therapeutic
  landscape for sickle cell disease (SCD) is changing with an increasing number of
  novel therapeutics. Hydroxyurea remains the primary disease-modifying therapy and,
  when started early in life with maintenance of an optimal dose, can reduce many
  SCD-related complications. To complement hydroxyurea, there are a growing number
  of pharmacologic options with additional efforts focused on the development and
  optimization of curative therapies. Here, we review current treatment options and
  provide recommendations as to how to approach the treatment of children and adolescents
  within this evolving therapeutic landscape to allow for full and healthy lives.
