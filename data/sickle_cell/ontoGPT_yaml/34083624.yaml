input_text: 'Hemodynamic and biological correlates of glomerular hyperfiltration in
  sickle cell patients before and under renin-angiotensin system blocker.Glomerular
  hyperfiltration alone or associated with albuminuria is a well-known feature of
  sickle cell associated nephropathy. Though, glomerular hyperfiltration is currently
  considered to be related to a high renal plasma flow and chronic hemolysis, cardiac
  output influence on measured glomerular filtration rate (mGFR) have not been investigated
  so far. Thirty seven homozygous sickle cell patients (SCA) from the RAND study investigated
  before and under angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) were included. Both
  mGFR and cardiac index (CI) were high (> 110 ml/min/1.73 m2 and > 3.5 l/m2 in 81%
  and 97% of cases) with low systemic vascular resistance (SVR) (< 700 dynes/s/cm-5)
  in 38% of cases. mGFR association with CI and SVR were significant at baseline (respectively
  rho: 0.44, p = 0.008 and rho: - 0.37, p = 0.02) and under ACEI (p = 0.007 and 0.01
  respectively), in accordance with previous data showing that hyperfiltration was
  linked to an increased glomerular perfusion and a glomerulomegaly rather than increased
  capillary hydrostatic pressure. Of notice, after adjustment on CI, mGFR remained
  associated with reticulocyte count and albuminuria under ACEI (p = 0.006 and 0.02
  respectively). Our results suggest that hyperfiltration is tightly linked to an
  increased cardiac output which may account for an increased renal blood flow. Chronic
  hemolysis could be a relevant factor accounting for hyperfiltration potentially
  acting on glomerular enlargement which appears as a key factor. Our data suggest
  that cardiac output assessment is a relevant tool in the routine management and
  monitoring of SCA nephropathy.'
