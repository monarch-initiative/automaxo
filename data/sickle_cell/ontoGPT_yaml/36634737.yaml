  Disease after Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation: A Mixed-Methods
  Study.Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) experience a considerable physical
  and psychosocial disease burden. In recent years, the application of allogeneic
  hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) to treat adults with SCD has increased.
  A thorough understanding of patients' physical, mental, and social health before
  and after cure is needed to meet the needs of this growing group of patients. We
  aimed to explore the perspectives of adult SCD patients on the changes in their
  experienced health and personal life goals after being cured. A mixed-methods approach
  was used, comprising a semistructured interview and a set of 9 Patient Reported
  Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) measures. Adult SCD patients who
  underwent HSCT at least 1 year earlier were eligible to participate in the study.
  Interviews were thematically analyzed using MAXQDA software. PROMIS T scores were
  compared with reference scores of the general population using SPSS Statistics.
  Ten patients participated in the study; their median age was 29.5 years (range,
  19 to 49 years), and their median time since HSCT was 2.7 years (range, 1.0 to 3.5
  years). Themes from the interviews were (1) pain/living pain free, (2) physical
  well-being, (3) mental well-being, (4) perspective/ outlook, (5) education/work,
  (6) family/friends, and (7) activities/participation. Following the PROMIS framework,
  we described these themes in a narrative synthesis according to health domain and
  categorized in 4 chronological time phases: before HSCT, first year post-transplantation,
  current situation, and future expectations. Physical health improved greatly, but
  transplantation-related toxicity, ongoing pain from avascular osteonecrosis, and
  fatigue negatively impacted quality of life in some patients. Furthermore, emotional
  struggles during the post-transplantation period were common, and patients expressed
  a need for psychological help. Patients reported improvements in social health and
  the ability to pursue personal life goals. The mean T scores of all PROMIS measures
  fell within the normal symptom limits compared with reference data of the general
  population, although, large variations were observed among the participants, matching
  our qualitative findings. In general, adult SCD patients experienced improved physical,
  mental, and social health after cure by HSCT and were able to pursue personal life
  goals. Yet they found themselves confronted with a new and unfamiliar reality that
  brought different challenges. Pain due to irreversible avascular osteonecrosis continued
  to have a negative impact. Clinicians should aim to help patients have realistic
  expectations before transplantation and offer timely psychological care."
