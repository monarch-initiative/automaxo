input_text: 'Neurofilament light chain: A potential biomarker for cerebrovascular
  disease in children with sickle cell anaemia.Cerebrovascular injury frequently occurs
  in children with sickle cell anaemia (SCA). Limited access to magnetic resonance
  imaging and angiography (MRI-MRA) in sub-Saharan Africa impedes detection of clinically
  unapparent cerebrovascular injury. Blood-based brain biomarkers of cerebral infarcts
  have been identified in non-SCA adults. Using plasma samples from a well-characterized
  cross-sectional sample of Ugandan children with SCA, we explored relationships between
  biomarker levels and MRI-detected cerebral infarcts and transcranial Doppler (TCD)
  arterial velocity. Testing was performed using a 4-plex panel of brain injury biomarkers,
  including neurofilament light chain (NfL), a central nervous system neuron-specific
  protein. Mean biomarker levels from the SCA group (n = 81) were similar to those
  from non-SCA sibling controls (n = 54). Within the SCA group, NfL levels were significantly
  higher in those with MRI-detected infarcts compared to no infarcts, and higher with
  elevated TCD velocity versus normal velocity. Elevated NfL remained strongly associated
  with MRI-detected infarcts after adjusting for sex and age. All non-SCA controls
  and SCA participants lacking MRI-detected infarcts had low NfL levels. These data
  suggest potential utility of plasma-based NfL levels to identify children with SCA
  cerebrovascular injury. Replication and prospective studies are needed to confirm
  these novel findings and the clinical utility of NfL versus MRI imaging.'
