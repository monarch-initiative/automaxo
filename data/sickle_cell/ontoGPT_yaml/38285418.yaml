input_text: Priapism in a Young Adult With Sickle Cell Disease. This article presents
  a case study focusing on priapism in a patient with sickle cell disease, with repeated
  emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations. The patient was successfully
  identified and treated by the ED nurse practitioner (NP) with aspiration of the
  corpus cavernosum. Priapism is a persistent penile erection that continues for an
  extended time. There is some argument about what that length of time is, but generally,
  the consensus is more than 4 hr beyond sexual stimulation or unrelated to sexual
  stimulation or sexual interest (Bivalacqua et al., 2022). Priapism is a fairly common
  but underrecognized complication of sickle cell disease. It represents a urological
  emergency in which timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment are vital to preserving
  penile tissue and sexual function. The diagnosis is made clinically with a comprehensive
  history, physical examination, and appropriate laboratory test values. Initial management
  can be conservative with hydration and analgesics or, if necessary, more invasive
  with needle aspiration to promote detumescence. Permanent tissue damage or erectile
  dysfunction can result if priapism is unrecognized, untreated, or not treated immediately.
  The NP plays an integral role in treating and preventing permanent damage. Patient
  education should focus on instructions for preventing priapism and managing episodes
  at home.
