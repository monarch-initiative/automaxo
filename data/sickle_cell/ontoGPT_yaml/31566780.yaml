input_text: 'The sex parameter in estimation of total blood volume for pediatric erythrocytapheresis.
  BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Estimation of the total blood volume (TBV) is fundamental
  to the control of automated red cell exchange (RCE). Error in the TBV estimate can
  produce outcomes that deviate from the prescribed targets, and may endanger the
  patient. Both the Spectra Optia and the COBE Spectra use the Nadler formulae to
  estimate TBV. There is a potential for large overestimates of TBV when the Nadler
  formula for males is applied to prepubertal boys. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study
  uses our large clinical experience with RCE to examine procedure outcomes when RCE
  in prepubertal boys is programed with the female parameter instead of male. We determined
  the differences between programmed and measured values for three outcomes: (a) Programmed
  End Hematocrit - Post spun HCT by Hemata Stat II, (b) Programmed End Hematocrit
  - Post CBC HCT, and (c) Predicted Post Hgb S+C - Measured Post Hgb S+C. We defined
  the experimental group as Male-Female, where the biological sex was male but programmed
  sex was female, and two control groups where programmed and biological sex were
  the same. RESULTS: Small but statistically significant differences were demonstrated
  between the mean programmed-to-observed deviations of these outcome measures in
  all but two group and subgroup comparisons; however, the absolute magnitudes of
  the observed differences were not clinically significant. The suggested weight cutoff
  to begin programming males as male is 35 kg. CONCLUSION: The study provides experiential
  validation that performing RCE in prepubertal boys using the female parameter is
  safe.'
