input_text: 'Optimal timing to screen for asymptomatic bacteriuria during pregnancy:
  first vs. second trimester. OBJECTIVES: Although current guidelines advice to screen
  for asymptomatic bacteriuria during pregnancy, little is known about the best moment
  of testing. The goal of this study is to analyze the optimal timing (first vs. second
  trimester) to screen for asymptomatic bacteriuria during pregnancy. METHODS: A retrospective
  cohort analysis, comparing patients that were screened for asymptomatic bacteriuria
  in the first vs. second trimester was performed. The main question was to compare
  the rate of positive urinary culture in both trimesters. Study included patients
  all followed a prenatal consultation at the University Hospital of Brussels between
  2012 and 2017. Other outcomes considered were the nature of identified germs, treatments,
  possible risk and confounding factors (age, BMI, gravidity-parity-abortus [GPA],
  type of conception, ethnicity, education, prior urinary tract infection (UTI), diabetes,
  hypertension, prior preterm delivery and sickle cell disease) and complications
  (UTI, preterm delivery, preterm rupture of the membranes and chorio-amnionitis).
  RESULTS: A total of 2,005 consecutive files were reviewed, 655 concerned patients
  screened during the first trimester group and 1,350 in the second trimester group.
  Asymptomatic bacteriuria was present in only 71 cases (3.54%), 23 in the first trimester
  group (3.50%) and 48 in the second trimester group (3.55%). Escherichia coli was
  the most frequently identified germ (37 cases (1.8%), 14 in the first trimester
  group and 23 in the second trimester group). Our logistic regression analysis shows
  no statistical difference according to the moment the urinary culture was done for
  the presence of asymptomatic bacteriuria (E. coli or others), for its association
  with hospitalization for pyelonephritis, preterm contractions, preterm pre-labor
  rupture of the membranes (PPROM) and/or preterm delivery. CONCLUSIONS: If recommendations
  remain to screen for asymptomatic bacteriuria at least once during pregnancy, this
  study indicates that the moment of testing (first vs. second trimester) has no clinical
  impact on obstetrical outcomes.'
