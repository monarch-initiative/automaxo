input_text: Blood Spotlight Review on Gene Therapy for Sickle Cell Disease.The root
  cause of sickle cell anemia has been known for seven decades, yet no curative therapies
  have been available other than allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, applicability
  is limited. Two potentially curative therapies based on gene therapy and gene editing
  strategies are about to enter the final stages of the FDA approval process. This
  review surveys the nature of these therapies and the opportunities and issues raised
  by the prospect of definitive genetically based therapies being available in clinical
  practice.
