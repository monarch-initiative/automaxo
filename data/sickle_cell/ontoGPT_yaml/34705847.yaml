input_text: 'Profile of Medicaid enrollees with sickle cell disease: A high need,
  high cost population. Sickle cell disease is a progressively debilitating genetic
  condition that affects red blood cells and can result in a variety of serious medical
  complications, reduced life expectancy, and diminished quality of life. Medicaid
  nationwide covered 66 percent of sickle cell disease hospitalizations in 2004 and
  58 percent of emergency department visits for the disease between 1999 and 2007.
  Using Medicaid data from four states with large populations that account for more
  than one-third of Medicaid program enrollment, we examined the characteristics of
  those with sickle cell disease. We found instances of mortality rates more than
  nine times the age-adjusted population average (in Texas, a mortality rate for Medicaid
  enrollees with SCD of 1.11 percent compared to 0.12 percent overall); rates of disability-related
  eligibility-which is associated with long-term Medicaid enrollment-of up to 69 percent;
  and half or more of affected enrollees having (all-cause) hospital stays, emergency
  department visits, and opioid prescription fills. With gene therapies on the horizon
  that will spur discussions of treatment coverage, costs, and outcomes for people
  with sickle cell disease, it is important for relevant stakeholders to understand
  the affected populations.'
