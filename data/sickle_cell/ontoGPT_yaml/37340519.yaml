input_text: "Indian sickle cell disease registry for surveillance and patient management:
  Development and implementation. In India, sickle cell disease (SCD) predominantly
  occurs in indigenous (tribal) people, who are about 104 million. However, screening
  and diagnosis seldom happen. This situation necessitates developing a comprehensive
  SCD care model, including a registry. This paper describes the development and implementation
  of the Indian SCD registry (ISCDR) in six tribal-dominated districts of India. The
  ISCDR was created in two components-(i) an Android-based mobile/tablet application,
  (ii) a dashboard/admin panel for patients' data management and retrieval. Data capture
  involves two electronic case report forms (CRF), that is, the primary form (CRF-1)
  and the repeat visit form (CRF-2). CRF-1 is completed as soon as the patient is
  found positive and captures the patient's information, including medical history,
  diagnosis, symptoms, precipitating factors, hospitalisation history and treatment
  received. Issues related to quality, security and data-sharing were addressed. After
  the screening system was functional, ISCDR was initiated. In 12 months, data of
  324 SCD patients and 1771 carriers were entered. The study demonstrates the feasibility
  of establishing an SCD registry in India. It collects systematic longitudinal data
  on SCD patients, which are essential for programme planning and management. Further,
  it is feasible to scale up and integrate with other health management databases."
