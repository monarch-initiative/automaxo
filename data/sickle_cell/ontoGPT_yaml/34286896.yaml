input_text: 'Transition care continuity promotes long-term retention in adult care
  among young adults with sickle cell disease.BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Care continuity
  prevents increased health care utilization and mortality during transition from
  pediatric to adult care. Our program employs a co-located care delivery model, in
  which pediatric provider involvement continues during young adulthood. We tested
  the hypothesis that individuals who participated in the co-located model have greater
  retention in adult care compared to those who only received pediatric transition
  services. METHODS: This study consisted of 311 youth with SCD (51.4% male; 63.0%
  HbSS/HbSbeta0 -thalassemia) who transferred to adult care from 2007 to 2017. Retention
  was defined as continuation with an adult provider for >=12 or >=24 months post-pediatric
  care. Logistic regression estimated the association between co-location status and
  retention at 12 and 24 months. Logistic regression and t-tests were used to evaluate
  potential predictors of retention in adult care. RESULTS: Individuals who participated
  in the co-location model were 1.9 times more likely to remain in adult care 12 (95%
  CI: 1.01, 3.47) and 24 (95% CI: 1.01, 3.70) months post-pediatric care compared
  to those who did not participate. Individuals with HbSS/HbSbeta0 -thalassemia were
  1.9 times more likely to be retained at 12 months compared to those with HbSC/HbSbeta+
  -thalassemia/HbS/HPFH (95% CI: 1.12, 3.09). For every clinic encounter in the last
  2 years of pediatric care, the odds of being retained at least 24 months after initiating
  adult care increased 1.1 times (95% CI: 1.02, 1.13). CONCLUSIONS: Continuity of
  providers from pediatric to adult care may increase long-term retention in adult
  care. Longitudinal monitoring of adult outcomes is critical to identifying the efficacy
  of transition services.'
