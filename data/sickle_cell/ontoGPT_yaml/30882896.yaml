input_text: "Hydroxyurea (hydroxycarbamide) for transfusion-dependent beta-thalassaemia.
  BACKGROUND: Hydroxyurea (hydroxycarbamide) promotes the production of foetal haemoglobin
  (HbF) by reactivating gamma-genes. Evidence has shown clinical benefits of hydroxyurea
  in people with sickle cell anemia; however, only a few studies have assessed this
  treatment in people with beta (beta)-thalassaemia. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective
  is to review the efficacy of hydroxyurea in reducing or ameliorating the requirement
  of blood transfusions in people with transfusion-dependent beta-thalassaemia. The
  second objective is to review the safety of hydroxyurea with regards to severe adverse
  effects in this population. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis
  and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, compiled from
  electronic database searches and hand searching of journals and conference abstract
  books. We also searched electronic databases and trial registries, including ClinicalTrials.gov,
  the WHO ICTRP and PubMed (09 October 2018).Date of last search of the Group's haemoglobinopathies
  trials register: 04 March 2019. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials
  of hydroxyurea in people with transfusion-dependent beta-thalassaemia, compared
  with placebo or standard treatment or comparing different doses of hydroxyurea.
  DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed trials for inclusion
  in the review, which was verified by a third author. MAIN RESULTS: No trials were
  eligible for inclusion in this review. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Currently, there is
  no high-quality evidence to support or challenge the continued use of hydroxyurea
  for managing people with transfusion-dependent beta-thalassaemia. Multicentre, randomised
  controlled trials (compared to placebo or other available treatment, i.e. blood
  transfusion and iron chelation) are needed in order to assess the efficacy and safety
  of hydroxyurea for reducing the need for blood transfusion, for maintaining or improving
  mean haemoglobin levels, as well as for determining its cost-effectiveness."
