input_text: 'Measuring transition readiness in adolescents and young adults with sickle
  cell disease using the transition readiness assessment questionnaire. BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES:
  Adolescents and young adults (AYA) with sickle cell disease (SCD) face challenges
  related to the disease and its treatment. The Transition Readiness Assessment Questionnaire
  (TRAQ) is a self-report tool for assessing transition readiness for youth with special
  health care needs (YSHCN), including SCD. This study uses the TRAQ to understand
  transition readiness in patients with SCD treated at the Boston Medical Center and
  evaluates associations between TRAQ scores and transition outcomes (e.g., emergency
  department reliance [EDr] and emergency department utilization [EDu]). METHODS:
  We reviewed electronic medical records of AYA with SCD who completed the TRAQ in
  the pediatric hematology clinic between January 1, 2019, and March 1, 2020, and
  categorized healthcare encounters to calculate EDu and EDr.  We used t tests and
  ANOVA models to analyze mean TRAQ scores, sex, age, genotype, EDu, and EDr. RESULTS:
  The sample was 45 AYA patients with SCD between 13 and 22 years old. The mean TRAQ
  score for the overall patient sample was 3.67. Mean TRAQ scores did not significantly
  vary by sex or genotype but did significantly increase with age. TRAQ scores did
  not correlate to EDu or EDr. CONCLUSIONS: AYA patients with SCD have low transition
  readiness. The age of 18 may not be the most reliable attribute of readiness, though
  older patients do have higher readiness. The relationship between TRAQ scores, EDr,
  and EDu is not clear and requires further evaluation.'
