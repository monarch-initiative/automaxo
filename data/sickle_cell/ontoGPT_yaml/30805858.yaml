input_text: 'Impact of Bariatric Surgery on Outcomes of Patients with Sickle Cell
  Disease: a Nationwide Inpatient Sample Analysis, 2004-2014. BACKGROUND: With advances
  in disease-specific treatments and improved overall survival, obesity rates are
  rising among patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). The primary aim of this study
  was to evaluate the role of bariatric surgery on clinical outcomes among hospitalized
  obese patients with SCD. METHODS: The United States Nationwide Inpatient Sample
  database was queried between 2004 and 2014 for discharges with co-diagnoses of morbid
  obesity and SCD. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes
  included vaso-occlusive crisis, acute chest syndrome, biliary-pancreatic complications,
  renal failure, urinary tract infection, malnutrition, sepsis, pneumonia, respiratory
  failure, thromboembolic events, strictures, wound infection, length of stay, and
  hospitalization costs. Using Poisson regression, adjusted incidence risk ratios
  (IRR) were derived for clinical outcomes in patients with prior-bariatric surgery
  compared to those without bariatric surgery. RESULTS: Among 2549 patients with a
  discharge diagnosis of SCD and morbid obesity, only 42 patients (1.7%) had bariatric
  surgery. On multivariable analysis, bariatric surgery did not influence mortality
  (P = 0.98). Bariatric surgery was not associated with increased risk for acute chest
  syndrome, sepsis, multi-organ failure, biliary-pancreatic, or surgery-related complications
  (all P > 0.05). Interestingly, bariatric surgery decreased risk of vaso-occlusive
  crises (IRR 0.21; 95% CI, 0.07-0.69; P = 0.01) in these patients and was associated
  with a shorter length of stay (P < 0.001) but higher hospitalization costs (P <
  0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Bariatric surgery may lower rates of vaso-occlusive crises
  in morbidly obese sickle cell patients without significantly affecting mortality
  and other adverse outcomes. In spite of this, these weight loss surgeries are underutilized
  in this select population.'
