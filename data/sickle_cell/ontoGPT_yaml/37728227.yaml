input_text: 'Potential for a large-scale newborn screening strategy for sickle cell
  disease in Mali: A comparative diagnostic performance study of two rapid diagnostic
  tests (SickleScan  and HemotypeSC ) on cord blood.Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a
  life-threatening disease requiring reliable early diagnosis. We assessed the acceptability
  and diagnostic performances of two rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) to identify SCD
  (HbSS, HbSC, HbS/beta-thalassaemia) or SCD carrier (HbS/HbC) in a pilot SCD newborn
  screening (NBS) strategy in Mali. All consenting delivering women were offered SCD
  NBS using cord blood sampling on two RDTs (SickleScan  and HemotypeSC ) compared
  to the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) gold standard to detect SCD
  states. From April 2021 to August 2021, 4333 delivering women were eligible of whom
  96.1% were offered NBS: 1.6% refused, 13.8% delivered before consenting and 84.6%
  consented; 3648 newborns were diagnosed by HPLC; 1.64% had SCD (0.63% HbSS, 0.85%
  HbSC, 0.16 HbS/beta-plus-thalassaemia); 21.79% were SCD carrier. To detect accurately
  SCD, SickleScan  had a sensitivity of 81.67% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 71.88-91.46)
  and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 99.69% (95% CI: 99.51-99.87); HemotypeSC  had
  a sensitivity of 78.33% (95% CI: 67.91-88.76) and a NPV of 99.64% (95% CI: 99.44-99.83).
  To detect SCD carrier: SickleScan  sensitivity was 96.10% (95% CI: 94.75-97.45)
  and NPV, 98.90% (95% CI: 98.51-99.29); HemotypeSC  sensitivity was 95.22% (95% CI:
  93.74-96.70) and NPV, 98.66% (95% CI: 98.24-99.03). Routine SCD NBS was acceptable.
  Compared with HPLC, both RDTs had reliable diagnostic performances to exclude SCD-free
  newborns and to identify SCD carriers to be further confirmed. This strategy could
  be implemented in large-scale NBS programmes.'
