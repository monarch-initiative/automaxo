input_text: 'Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome secondary to asymptomatic
  poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis in a child with sickle cell anemia: a case
  report. BACKGROUND: Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome is a neurotoxic
  condition that occurs as a result of the failure of posterior circulatory autoregulation
  in response to acute changes in blood pressure. Overperfusion with resultant disruption
  of the blood-brain barrier results in vasogenic edema, but not infarction. Posterior
  reversible encephalopathy syndrome can be the presenting feature of postinfectious
  glomerulonephritis, which has been reported in approximately 5% of hospitalized
  children, and it has been reported in very few cases of adult patients with sickle
  cell anemia. We report a very rare case of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome
  that occurred in a child with sickle cell anemia. This presentation should be differentiated
  from other neurologic manifestations that occur in patients with sickle cell anemia,
  because management is totally different. CASE PRESENTATION: We report what is to
  our knowledge the first reported case of a 9-year-old Saudi girl with sickle cell
  anemia who developed posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome secondary to asymptomatic
  poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis. This occurred after full recovery from acute
  chest syndrome and severe vaso-occlusive crisis. CONCLUSIONS: The purpose of this
  report is to emphasize that all efforts should be made to explore the causes of
  different neurologic manifestations that occur in patients with sickle cell anemia,
  because this will require different pathways of management.'
