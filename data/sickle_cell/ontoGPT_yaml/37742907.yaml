input_text: 'Buprenorphine, It Works so Differently: Adults with Sickle Cell Disease
  Describe Transitioning to Buprenorphine for Treatment of Chronic Pain.A growing
  body of literature describes the use of buprenorphine for the treatment of chronic
  pain in people with sickle cell disease. The experiences of people with sickle cell
  disease who have tried buprenorphine are not yet reported. This qualitative descriptive
  study was conducted to explore perspectives on buprenorphine for chronic pain in
  sickle cell disease. We interviewed 13 participants with sickle cell disease who
  had been prescribed buprenorphine and had a clinic visit between December 1, 2020
  and April, 2022 in our Sickle Cell Center for Adults. Interviews were recorded,
  transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis. Eleven out of 13 participants
  were taking buprenorphine at the time of the interview, with mean treatment duration
  of 33 months (SD 18, range 7 to 78 months). Five major themes were identified: 1)
  dissatisfaction with full agonist opioids; 2) navigating uncertainty with autonomy
  in deciding to try buprenorphine; 3) functional and relational changes after starting
  buprenorphine, 4) enduring systemic barriers to pain treatment, and 5) trusting
  treatment relationships are necessary when approaching patients about buprenorphine.
  The experience of adulthood living with sickle cell disease before and after starting
  buprenorphine is qualitatively different with significant improvements in social
  functioning. PERSPECTIVE: This study examined the experience of adults with sickle
  cell disease and chronic pain transitioning from full agonist opioids to buprenorphine.
  It is the first qualitative study of buprenorphine in people with sickle cell disease,
  contributing to a small but growing literature about buprenorphine and sickle cell
  disease.'
