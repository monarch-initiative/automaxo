input_text: 'Low dose ketamine versus morphine for acute severe vaso occlusive pain
  in children: a randomized controlled trial. BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Acute pain episodes
  associated with sickle cell disease (SCD) are very difficult to manage effectively.
  Opioid tolerance and side effects have been major roadblocks in our ability to provide
  these patients with adequate pain relief. Ketamine is cheap, widely safe, readily
  available drug, with analgesic effects at sub-anesthetic doses and has been used
  in wide range of surgeries, pediatric burns dressing change and cancer related pain
  however, literature concerning its use in sickle cell crises is still limited in
  our setting. This study aimed to establish if 1 mg/kg of intravenous ketamine is
  non inferior to intravenous morphine 0.1 mg/kg in severe SCD-associated pain. METHODS:
  We performed an institutional review board-approved randomized, prospective, double-blinded,
  active-control, non-inferiority trial at the national referral sickle cell center.
  Children between 7 and 18 years of age with severe painful sickle cell crisis, defined
  by numerical rating scale score of greater or equal to 7 were enrolled. Patients
  were consented and randomized to receive, either IV ketamine (LDK) 1 mg/kg or IV
  morphine (MOR) 0.1 mg/kg as an infusion over 10 min. The primary endpoint is maximal
  change in Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) pain score. Secondary outcomes were, incidence
  of adverse effects, optimal time to and duration of action of ketamine and incidence
  of treatment failures by treatment group. A clinically meaningful difference in
  validated pain scores was defined as 1.3 units. Assuming both treatments are on
  average equal, a sample size of 240 patients (120 per group) provided 95% power
  to demonstrate that IV LDK is non-inferior to IV morphine with a 0.05 level of significance
  and a 10% non-inferiority margin. All analyses were based on a modified intention
  to treat. This trial was registered with clinicaltrials.gov NCT02434939. RESULTS:
  Two hundred and forty patients were enrolled (LDK120, MOR120). Demographic variables
  and baseline NRS scores (8.9 vs. 9.2) were similar. LDK was comparable to MOR in
  the maximum change in NRS scores, 66.4% vs. 61.3% (MD 5.5; 95% CI -2.2 to -13.2).
  Time to achieve maximum reduction in NRS pain scores was at 19.8 min for LDK and
  34.1 min for MOR. The average duration of action for LDK was 60 min. MOR had more
  patients still at maximum effect at 120 min (45.8% vs. 37.5%; RR 1.2; 95% CI 0.9-1.7).
  LDK patients were 11.3 times more likely to develop side effects, though were transient,
  anticipated and non-life threatening (37.5% vs. 3.3%). MOR had significantly more
  treatment failures 40% vs. 28.3% (RR 0.7; 95% CI 0.5-1.03, p=0.07) Vital signs and
  sedation scores were similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous LDK at 1 mg/kg
  provides comparable analgesic effectiveness as IV MOR in the acute treatment of
  severe painful sickle cell crisis in children in the day care sickle cell center.
  However, it is associated with a high incidence of several transient, non-life threatening
  mild side effects. IMPLICATIONS: Intravenous ketamine at 1 mg/kg can be a reliable
  alternative to morphine in the management of severe painful sickle cell crisis especially
  in a resource limited area where morphine is not readily available.'
