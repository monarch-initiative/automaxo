input_text: 'Hypoxic storage of donor red cells preserves deformability after exposure
  to plasma from adults with sickle cell disease. BACKGROUND: Red cell (RBC) transfusions
  are beneficial for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), but ex vivo studies
  suggest that inflamed plasma from patients with SCD during crises may damage these
  RBCs, diminishing their potential efficacy. The hypoxic storage of RBCs may improve
  transfusion efficacy by minimizing the storage lesion. We tested the hypotheses
  that (1) The donor RBCs exposed to the plasma of patients in crisis would have lower
  deformability and higher hemolysis than those exposed to non-crisis plasma, and
  (2) hypoxic storage, compared to standard storage, of donor RBCs could preserve
  deformability and reduce hemolysis. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: 18 SCD plasma samples
  from patients who had severe acute-phase symptoms (A-plasma; n = 9) or were at a
  steady-state (S = plasma; n = 9) were incubated with 16 RBC samples from eight units
  that were stored either under conventional(CRBC) or hypoxic(HRBC) conditions. Hemolysis
  and microcapillary deformability assays of these RBCs were analyzed using linear
  mixed-effect models after each sample was incubated in patient plasma overnight
  at 37 C RESULTS: Relative deformability was 0.036 higher (p < 0.0001) in HRBC pairs
  compared to CRBC pairs regardless of plasma type. Mean donor RBC hemolysis was 0.33%
  higher after incubation with A-plasma compared to S-plasma either with HRBC or CRBC
  (p = 0.04). HRBCs incubated with steady-state patient plasma demonstrated the highest
  deformability and lowest hemolysis. CONCLUSION: Hypoxic storage significantly influenced
  RBC deformability. Patient condition significantly influenced post-incubation hemolysis.
  Together, HRBCs in steady-state plasma maximized donor red cell ex vivo function
  and survival.'
