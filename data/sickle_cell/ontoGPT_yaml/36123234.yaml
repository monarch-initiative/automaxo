input_text: 'Editing human hematopoietic stem cells: advances and challenges. Genome
  editing of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells is being developed for the treatment
  of several inherited disorders of the hematopoietic system. The adaptation of CRISPR-Cas9-based
  technologies to make precise changes to the genome, and developments in altering
  the specificity and efficiency, and improving the delivery of nucleases to target
  cells have led to several breakthroughs. Many clinical trials are ongoing, and several
  pre-clinical models have been reported that would allow these genetic therapies
  to one day offer a potential cure to patients with diseases where limited options
  currently exist. However, there remain several challenges with respect to establishing
  safety, expanding accessibility and improving the manufacturing processes of these
  therapeutic products. This review focuses on some of the recent advances in the
  field of genome editing of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and illustrates
  the ongoing challenges.'
