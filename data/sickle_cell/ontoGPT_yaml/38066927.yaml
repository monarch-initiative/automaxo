input_text: Gene therapy for sickle cell disease. Sickle cell disease (SCD) is potentially
  curable after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or autologous
  HSCT after ex vivo genetic modification. Autologous HSCT with gene therapy has the
  potential to overcome many of the limitations of allogeneic HSCT that include the
  lack of suitable donors, graft-versus-host disease, the need for immune suppression,
  and the potential for graft rejection. Significant progress in gene therapy for
  SCD has been made over the past several decades, now with a growing number of clinical
  trials investigating various gene addition and gene editing strategies. Available
  results from a small number of patients, some with relatively short follow-up, are
  promising as a potentially curative strategy, with current efforts focused on continuing
  to improve the efficacy, durability, and safety of gene therapies for the cure of
  SCD.
