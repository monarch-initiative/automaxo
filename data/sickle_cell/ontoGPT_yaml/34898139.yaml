input_text: 'Biologic and Clinical Efficacy of LentiGlobin for Sickle Cell Disease.
  BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease is characterized by the painful recurrence of vaso-occlusive
  events. Gene therapy with the use of LentiGlobin for sickle cell disease (bb1111;
  lovotibeglogene autotemcel) consists of autologous transplantation of hematopoietic
  stem and progenitor cells transduced with the BB305 lentiviral vector encoding a
  modified beta-globin gene, which produces an antisickling hemoglobin, HbAT87Q. METHODS:
  In this ongoing phase 1-2 study, we optimized the treatment process in the initial
  7 patients in Group A and 2 patients in Group B with sickle cell disease. Group
  C was established for the pivotal evaluation of LentiGlobin for sickle cell disease,
  and we adopted a more stringent inclusion criterion that required a minimum of four
  severe vaso-occlusive events in the 24 months before enrollment. In this unprespecified
  interim analysis, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of LentiGlobin in 35 patients
  enrolled in Group C. Included in this analysis was the number of severe vaso-occlusive
  events after LentiGlobin infusion among patients with at least four vaso-occlusive
  events in the 24 months before enrollment and with at least 6 months of follow-up.
  RESULTS: As of February 2021, cell collection had been initiated in 43 patients
  in Group C; 35 received a LentiGlobin infusion, with a median follow-up of 17.3
  months (range, 3.7 to 37.6). Engraftment occurred in all 35 patients. The median
  total hemoglobin level increased from 8.5 g per deciliter at baseline to 11 g or
  more per deciliter from 6 months through 36 months after infusion. HbAT87Q contributed
  at least 40% of total hemoglobin and was distributed across a mean (+-SD) of 85+-8%
  of red cells. Hemolysis markers were reduced. Among the 25 patients who could be
  evaluated, all had resolution of severe vaso-occlusive events, as compared with
  a median of 3.5 events per year (range, 2.0 to 13.5) in the 24 months before enrollment.
  Three patients had a nonserious adverse event related or possibly related to LentiGlobin
  that resolved within 1 week after onset. No cases of hematologic cancer were observed
  during up to 37.6 months of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: One-time treatment with LentiGlobin
  resulted in sustained production of HbAT87Q in most red cells, leading to reduced
  hemolysis and complete resolution of severe vaso-occlusive events. (Funded by Bluebird
