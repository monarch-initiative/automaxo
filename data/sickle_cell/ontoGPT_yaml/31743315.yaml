input_text: Social Determinants of Health and Emergency Department Use Among Children
  With Sickle Cell Disease. Sickle cell disease (SCD) is associated with disproportionate
  emergency department (ED) use. This study described the social determinants of health
  associated with ED visits and hospital admission from the ED among children with
  SCD using a nationally representative dataset. We analyzed data from 126 children
  0 to 17 years of age with SCD included in the 2011 to 2017 rounds of the National
  Health Interview Survey (mean age, 8 y; 50% female individuals; 74% African American).
  Study variables were summarized using weighted means and proportions and compared
  according to ED use and admission by Wald tests. Fifty-two identified children had
  visited the ED within the last 12 months and 21 were admitted to the hospital after
  their most recent ED visit. Children living in a single-mother household were more
  likely to visit the ED (P=0.040), as were younger children (mean age, 6 vs. 9 y;
  P=0.034), with no evaluated social determinants of health significantly impacting
  hospital admission from the ED. The lack of association between ED use and either
  poverty or insurance type may be related to the overall high level of social disadvantage
  among children with SCD. Our findings demonstrate the need to better characterize
  specific social factors impacting acute care use among children with SCD.

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  primary_disease: <The main disease the text is about, or its central disease topic. This is often the disease mentioned in an article's title or in its first few sentences.>
  medical_actions: <Semicolon-separated list of medical actions, where each is a clinically prescribed procedure, therapy, intervention, or recommendation.>
  symptoms: <Semicolon-separated list of signs or symptoms.>
  chemicals: <Semicolon-separated list of chemicals or drugs>
  action_annotation_relationships: <Semicolon-separated list of relationships between a disease, the mentioned signs and symptoms associated with that disease, the medical actions relating to each symptom, and the type of relationship between each action and symptom (usually TREATS or PREVENTS). The disease name must be included in the relationship, for example, "treatment TREATS symptom IN disease". If the medical action includes a specific chemical or drug, include the chemical or drug name in the relationship, for example, "treatment (with chemical) TREATS symptom IN disease".>
