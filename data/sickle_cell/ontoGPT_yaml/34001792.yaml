input_text: 'Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in a Pediatric Patient With Sickle
  Cell Disease and COVID-19: A Case Report. To this day, there are limited data about
  the effects and management of coronavirus disease infection in pediatric patients
  with sickle cell disease. We present the management and successful clinical course
  of an 8-year-old female with homozygous sickle cell disease (SS) and severe acute
  chest syndrome secondary to coronavirus disease 2019 infection, complicated by cortical
  vein thrombosis.'
