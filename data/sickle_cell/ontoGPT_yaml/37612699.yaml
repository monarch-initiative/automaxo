input_text: 'Factors associated with hospital admission and 30-day readmission for
  children less than 18 years of age in 2018 in France: a one-year nationwide observational
  study.BACKGROUND: Nationwide data for children for short-stay hospitalisation (SSH)
  and associated factors are scarce. This retrospective study of children in France
  < 18 years of age followed after their birth or birthday in 2018 focused on at least
  one annual SSH, stay < 1 night or >= 1 night, or 30-day readmission >= 1 night.
  METHODS: Children were selected from the national health data system (SNDS), which
  includes data on long-term chronic disease (LTD) status with full reimbursement
  and complementary universal coverage based on low household income (CMUC). Uni and
  multivariate quasi-Poisson regression were applied for each outcome. RESULTS: Among
  13.211 million children (94.4% population, 51.2% boys), CMUC was identified for
  17.5% and at least one LTD for 4% (0-<1 year: 1.5%; 14-<18 year: 5.2%). The most
  frequent LTDs were pervasive developmental diseases (0.53%), asthma (0.24%), epilepsy
  (0.17%), and type 1 diabetes (0.15%). At least one SSH was found for 8.8%: SSH <
  1 night (4.9%), SSH >= 1 night (4.5%), readmission (0.4%). Children with at least
  one SSH were younger (median 6 vs. 9 years) and more often had CMUC (21%), a LTD
  (12%), an emergency department (ED) visit (56%), or various primary healthcare visits
  than all children. Those with a SSH >=1 night vs. < 1 night were older (median:
  9 vs. 4 years). They had the same frequency of LTD (13.4%) but more often an ED
  visit (78% vs. 42%). Children with readmissions were younger (median 3 years). They
  had the highest levels of CMUC (29.3%), LTD (34%), EDs in their municipality (35%
  vs. 29% for the whole population) and ED visits (87%). In adjusted analysis, each
  outcome was significantly less frequent among girls than boys and more frequent
  for children with CMUC. LTDs with the largest association with SSH < 1 night were
  cystic fibrosis, sickle cell diseases (SCD), diabetes type 1, those with SSH >=1
  night type 1 diabetes epilepsy and SCD, and those for readmissions lymphoid leukaemia,
  malignant neoplasm of the brain, and SCD. Among all SSH admissions of children <
  10 years, 25.8% were potentially preventable. CONCLUSION: Higher SSH and readmission
  rates were found for children with certain LTD living in low-income households,
  suggesting the need or increase of specific policy actions and research.'
