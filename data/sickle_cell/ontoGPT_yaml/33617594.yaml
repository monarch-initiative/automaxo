input_text: "Characteristics of sickle cell patients with frequent emergency department
  visits and hospitalizations.Vaso-occlusive episodes (VOEs) are a hallmark of sickle
  cell disease (SCD), and account for >90% of health care encounters for this patient
  population. The Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease, a large study enrolling
  >3000 patients, showed that the majority of SCD patients (80%) experienced 0-3 major
  pain crises/year. Only a small minority (~5%) experienced >=6 VOEs/year. Our study
  sought to further understand this difference in VOE frequency between SCD patients.
  We analyzed 25 patients (13M/12F, mean age of 28.8) with >=6 ED visits or hospitalizations/year
  (high utilizers), and compared these with 9 patients (6M/3F, mean age of 37.6) who
  had <=2 ED visits or hospitalizations/year (low utilizers). All subjects were given
  a demographic survey along with questionnaires for depression, anxiety, and Health
  Locus of Control. Each subject then underwent quantitative sensory testing (QST)
  with three different modalities: pressure pain sensitivity, heat and cold sensitivity,
  and Von Frey monofilament testing. Laboratory and clinical data were collected through
  subjects' medical records. CBC and chemistry analysis showed high utilizers had
  higher WBC (p<0.01), ANC (p<0.01), total bilirubin (p = 0.02), and lower MCV (p
  = 0.03). Opioid use (morphine equivalents) over the past 6 months was significantly
  higher in the high utilizer group (12125.7 mg vs 2423.1 mg, p = 0.005). QST results
  showed lower pressure pain threshold at the ulna (224.4 KPa vs 338.9 KPa, p = 0.04)
  in the high utilizer group. High utilizers also had higher anxiety (9.0 vs 4.6,
  p = 0.04) and depression scores (10.0 vs 6.0, p = 0.051). While the low utilizer
  group had higher education levels with more associate and bachelor degrees (p =
  0.009), there was no difference in income or employment. These data show that many
  biological and psychosocial factors contribute to high health care utilization in
  SCD. A multi-disciplinary and multi-faceted approach will be required to address
  this complex problem."
