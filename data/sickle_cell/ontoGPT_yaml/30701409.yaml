input_text: 'Gene Therapy for Beta-Hemoglobinopathies: Milestones, New Therapies and
  Challenges. Inherited monogenic disorders such as beta-hemoglobinopathies (BH) are
  fitting candidates for treatment via gene therapy by gene transfer or gene editing.
  The reported safety and efficacy of lentiviral vectors in preclinical studies have
  led to the development of several clinical trials for the addition of a functional
  beta-globin gene. Across trials, dozens of transfusion-dependent patients with sickle
  cell disease (SCD) and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia (TDT) have been treated
  via gene therapy and have achieved reduced transfusion requirements. While overall
  results are encouraging, the outcomes appear to be strongly influenced by the level
  of lentiviral integration in transduced cells after engraftment, as well as the
  underlying genotype resulting in thalassemia. In addition, the method of procurement
  of hematopoietic stem cells can affect their quality and thus the outcome of gene
  therapy both in SCD and TDT. This suggests that new studies aimed at maximizing
  the number of corrected cells with long-term self-renewal potential are crucial
  to ensure successful treatment for every patient. Recent advancements in gene transfer
  and bone marrow transplantation have improved the success of this approach, and
  the results obtained by using these strategies demonstrated significant improvement
  of gene transfer outcome in patients. The advent of new gene-editing technologies
  has suggested additional therapeutic options. These are primarily focused on correcting
  the defective beta-globin gene or editing the expression of genes or genomic segments
  that regulate fetal hemoglobin synthesis. In this review, we aim to establish the
  potential benefits of gene therapy for BH, to summarize the status of the ongoing
  trials, and to discuss the possible improvement or direction for future treatments.'
