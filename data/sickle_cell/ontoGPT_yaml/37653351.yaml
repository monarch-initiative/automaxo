input_text: 'Kidney failure outcomes in children and young adults with sickle cell
  disease in the United States Renal Data System. BACKGROUND: Children and young adults
  with sickle cell disease (SCD) develop kidney disease early in childhood, with some
  patients progressing to require dialysis and kidney transplantation. The prevalence
  and outcomes of children with kidney failure (chronic kidney disease stage 5) due
  to SCD are not well described. This study aimed to assess the outcome of children
  and young adults with SCD with kidney failure compared to matched children and young
  adults without SCD with kidney failure in a large national database. METHODS: Utilizing
  the United States Renal Data System (USRDS), we retrospectively examined kidney
  failure outcomes in children and young adults with SCD from 1998 to 2019. RESULTS:
  We identified 97 patients with SCD who developed kidney failure and identified 96
  matched controls with a median age of 19 years (IQR 17, 21) at the time of kidney
  failure diagnosis. SCD patients had significantly shorter survival (8.4 years vs.
  14.0 years, p < 0.001) and had a longer waiting time for their first transplant
  when compared to matched non-SCD kidney failure patients (12.1 years vs. 7.3 years,
  p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Children and young adults with SCD kidney failure have
  significantly higher mortality when matched to non-SCD kidney failure children and
  experience a longer mean time to kidney transplant.'
