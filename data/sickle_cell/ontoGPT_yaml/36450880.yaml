input_text: Bone loss is ameliorated by fecal microbiota transplantation through SCFA/GPR41/
  IGF1 pathway in sickle cell disease mice. Bone loss is common in sickle cell disease
  (SCD), but the molecular mechanisms is unclear. Serum insulin-like growth factor
  1 (IGF1) was low in SCD subjects and SCD mice. To determine if decreased IGF1 associated
  with low bone mass in SCD is due to reduced SCFA production by gut microbiota, we
  performed reciprocal fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) between healthy control
  (Ctrl) and SCD mice. uCT and histomorphometry analysis of femur showed decreased
  bone volume/total volume (BV/TV), trabecular number (Tb.N), osteoblast surface/bone
  surface (Ob.S/BS), mineralizing surface/ bone surface (MS/BS), inter-label thickness
  (Ir.L.Th) in SCD mice were significantly improved after receiving Ctrl feces. Bone
  formation genes Alp, Col1, Runx2, and Dmp1 from SCD mice were significantly decreased
  and were rescued after FMT from Ctrl feces. Transplantation of Ctrl feces increased
  the butyrate, valerate, and propionate levels in cecal content of SCD mice. Decreased
  G-coupled protein receptors 41 and 43 (GPR41 and GPR43) mRNA in tibia and lower
  IGF1 in bone and serum of SCD mice were partially restored after FMT from Ctrl feces.
  These data indicate that the healthy gut microbiota of Ctrl mice is protective for
  SCD bone loss through regulating IGF1 in response to impaired bacterial metabolites
  SCFAs.
