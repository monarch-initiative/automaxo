input_text: 'Motixafortide: First Approval.Motixafortide (APHEXDATM) is a selective
  C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) inhibitor being developed by BioLineRx
  under licence from Biokine Therapeutics for the mobilization of haematopoietic stem
  cells (HSCs) and the treatment of various cancers. On 11 September 2023, motixafortide
  was approved in the USA for use in combination with filgrastim [granulocyte colony
  stimulating factor (G-CSF)] to mobilize HSCs to the peripheral blood for collection
  and subsequent autologous transplantation in patients with multiple myeloma. Motixafortide
  has been granted Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of pancreatic cancer
  in the EU and the USA, and for the treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia in the USA.
  Clinical development is ongoing for the mobilization of CD34+ HSCs for gene therapy
  in patients with sickle cell disease. This article summarizes the milestones in
  the development of motixafortide leading to this first approval.'
