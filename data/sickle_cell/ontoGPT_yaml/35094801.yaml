input_text: 'Health State Utilities for Sickle Cell Disease: A Catalog Prepared From
  a Systematic Review. OBJECTIVES: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a complex, chronic
  condition that impairs health-related quality of life of affected individuals and
  their caregivers. As curative therapies emerge, comprehensive cost-effectiveness
  models will inform their value. These models will require descriptions of health
  states and their corresponding utility values that accurately reflect health-related
  quality of life over the disease trajectory. The objectives of this systematic review
  were to develop a catalog of health state utility (HSU) values for SCD, identify
  research gaps, and provide future directions for preference elicitation. METHODS:
  Records were identified through searches of PubMed and Embase, Tufts Medical Center
  Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry, reference lists of relevant articles, and
  consultation with SCD experts (2008-2020). We removed duplicate records and excluded
  ineligible studies. For included studies, we summarized the study characteristics,
  methods used for eliciting HSUs, and HSU values. RESULTS: Five studies empirically
  elicited utilities using indirect methods (EQ-5D) (n = 3) and Short Form-6 Dimension
  (n = 2); these represent health states associated with general SCD (n = 1), SCD
  complications (n = 2), and SCD treatments (n = 3). Additionally, we extracted HSUs
  from 7 quality-adjusted life-years-based outcome research studies. The HSU among
  patients with general SCD without specifying complications ranged from 0.64 to 0.887.
  Only 36% of the HSUs used in the quality-adjusted life-year-based outcomes research
  studies were derived from individuals with SCD. No study estimated HSUs in caregivers.
  CONCLUSIONS: There is a dearth of literature of HSUs for use in SCD models. Future
  empirical studies should elicit a comprehensive set of HSUs from individuals with
  SCD and their caregivers.'
