input_text: Long-term Survival after Hematopoietic Cell Transplant for Sickle Cell
  Disease Compared to the United States Population. Hematopoietic cell transplant
  for sickle cell disease is curative but is associated with life threatening complications
  most of which occur within the first 2 years after transplantation. In the current
  era with interest in gene therapy and gene editing we felt it timely to report on
  sickle cell disease transplant recipients who were alive for at least 2-year after
  transplantation, not previously reported. Our objectives were to (1) report the
  conditional survival rates of patients who were alive for 2 or more years after
  transplantation (2) identify risk factors for death beyond 2 years after transplantation
  and (3) compare all-cause mortality risks to those of an age-, sex- and race-matched
  general population in the United States. By limiting to 2-year survivors, we exclude
  deaths that occur as a direct consequence of the transplantation procedure. De-identified
  records of 1149 patients were reviewed from a publicly available data source and
  950 patients were eligible (https://picsure.biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov). All
  analyses were performed in this secure cloud environment using the available statistical
  software package(s). The validity of the public database was confirmed by reproducing
  results from an earlier publication. Conditional survival estimates were obtained
  using the Kaplan-Meier method for the sub-cohort that had survived a given length
  (x) of time after transplantation. Cox regression models were built to identify
  risk factors associated with mortality beyond 2 years after transplantation. The
  standardized relative mortality risk (SMR) or the ratio of observed to expected
  number of deaths, was used to quantify all-cause mortality risk after transplantation
  and compared to age, race and sex-matched general population. Person-years at risk
  were calculated from an anchor date (i.e., 2-, 5- and 7-years) after transplantation
  until date of death or last date known alive. The expected number of deaths was
  calculated using age, race and sex-specific US mortality rates. The median follow
  up was 5 years (range 2-20) and 300 (32%) patients were observed for more than 7
  years. Among those who lived for at least 7 years after transplantation the 12-year
  probability of survival was 97% (95% CI, 92%-99%). Compared to an age-, race- and
  sex-matched US population, the risk for late death after transplantation was higher
  as late as 7 years after transplantation (hazard ratio (HR) 3.2; P= .020) but the
  risk receded over time. Risk factors for late death included age at transplant and
  donor type. For every 10-year increment in patient age, an older patient was 1.75
  times more likely to die than a younger patient (P= .0004). Compared to HLA-matched
  siblings the use of other donors was associated with higher risk for late death
  (HR 3.49; P= .003). Graft failure (beyond 2-years after transplantation) was 7%
  (95% CI, 5%-9%) and graft failure was higher after transplantation of grafts from
  donors who were not HLA-matched siblings (HR 2.59, P< .0001). Long-term survival
  after transplantation is excellent and support this treatment as a cure for sickle
  cell disease. The expected risk for death recedes over time but the risk for late
  death is not negligible.
