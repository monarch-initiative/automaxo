input_text: Successful mismatched hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for pediatric
  hemoglobinopathy by using ATG and post-transplant cyclophosphamide. The use of HLA-mismatched
  (un)related donors is historically associated with a higher incidence of transplant-related
  complications and mortality. However, the use of such donors may overcome the limited
  availability of HLA-matched donors for patients with beta-thalassemia major (TM)
  and sickle cell disease (SCD). We investigated hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
  (HSCT) outcomes of pediatric TM and SCD patients treated with a mismatched donor
  using a treosulfan-based conditioning in combination with ATG and post-transplant
  cyclophosphamide (PT-CY) and compared these results to the clinical outcome of patients
  treated by matched donor HSCT without PT-CY. Thirty-eight children (n = 24 HLA-identical
  or 10/10-matched donors; n = 14 HLA-mismatched donors), who received a non-depleted
  bone marrow graft were included. Event-free survival (EFS) and GvHD were not higher
  in the mismatched PT-Cy group as compared to the matched group. Moreover, despite
  delayed neutrophil engraftment (day +22 vs. +26, p = 0.002) and immune recovery
  in the mismatched PT-Cy group, this did not result in more infectious complications.
  Therefore, we conclude that in the absence of an HLA-identical or a matched unrelated
  donor, HSCT with a mismatched unrelated or haploidentical donor in combination with
  ATG plus PT-CY can be considered a safe and effective treatment option for pediatric
  hemoglobinopathy patients.
