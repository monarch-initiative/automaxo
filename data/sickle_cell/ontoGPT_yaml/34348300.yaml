input_text: 'Assessment of Renal Function Status in Steady-State Sickle Cell Anaemic
  Children Using Urine Human Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin and Albumin:Creatinine
  Ratio.INTRODUCTION: Sickle cell anaemia is characterized by defective haemoglobin
  synthesis and is associated with both endocrine and metabolic alterations. The effects
  of this clinical condition on kidney function are multifactorial and often begin
  early in childhood. This study aims to assess renal function in children with sickle
  cell anaemia using urine albumin:creatinine ratio (ACR) and urine human neutrophil
  gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL). METHODS: This case-control study was conducted
  on 200 children aged 5-15 years in 2 tertiary hospitals in South West Nigeria: 150
  were of haemoglobin S genotype and 50 were of haemoglobin A genotype. Serum urea,
  creatinine, urine albumin, and NGAL were assayed by known standard methods. eGFR,
  urine ACR, and urine NGAL/creatinine ratio (urine NCR) were calculated. RESULTS:
  The weight, height, BMI, systolic blood pressure, plasma urea, plasma creatinine,
  and spot urine creatinine of the HbS genotype children were significantly lower
  compared to that of the HbA genotype children. The eGFR, spot urine albumin, and
  urine ACR were significantly higher in the HbS group compared to the HbA group.
  There was no significant difference in the spot urine NGAL and urine NCR between
  the 2 groups, though both were higher in the HbS group compared to the HbA group.
  CONCLUSIONS: Kidney injury probably starts early in childhood in sickle cell individuals
  as indicated by the higher urine ACR detected in them. We infer that urine NGAL
  and uNCR are not sensitive markers of kidney disease especially in young sickle
  cell individuals possibly because of the hyperfiltration present at this age.'
