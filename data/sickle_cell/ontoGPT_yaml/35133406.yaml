input_text: "GRNDaD: big data and sickle cell disease.Big data are used in the pursuit
  of precision medicine in the general population. Applying these tools to patients
  with sickle cell disease (SCD) is essential for ensuring that they receive the most
  appropriate customized therapy for their disease. For these tools to be applied,
  there must be a large number of willing, fully phenotyped participants in collaborative
  registries. Working collaboratively to respond to unmet clinical needs and the lack
  of a large multisite registry, SCD providers at multiple sites developed The Globin
  Regional Data and Discovery (GRNDaD) registry. The specific goals of GRNDaD are
  to (1) prospectively obtain high-quality curated data on the evolving population
  affected by SCD; (2) improve adherence to guideline-based care; (3) provide a platform
  for ongoing quality improvement across sites; (4) allow for real-time investigation
  of therapies, and collaborate broadly to address research questions using GRNDaD
  as a shared platform. GRNDaD's current strength lies in the generous participation
  of people living with SCD, collaborative investigators, and the opportunity to conduct
  quality improvement activities across a large number of sites. GRNDaD will serve
  as the data collection tool for the Health Resources and Services Administration
  Sickle Cell Treatment Demonstration Program and for the newly established National
  Alliance for Sickle Cell Centers (https://www.sicklecellcenters.org/). GRNDaD is
  a robust collaborative registry that providers and researchers will use to identify
  genetic markers that will help predict outcomes and lead to a better understanding
  of the natural history of SCD in the modern era of novel therapies."
