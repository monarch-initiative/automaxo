input_text: 'Pregnancy and assisted reproductive technology use in Australian female
  transfusion-dependent haemoglobinopathy patients: a 20-year retrospective analysis.
  BACKGROUND: In the last few decades, the life expectancy of patients with transfusion-dependent
  thalassaemia (TDT) and sickle cell disease (SCD) has improved significantly, in
  part because of improved iron chelation. Fertility challenges and pregnancy complications
  have historically limited reproductive options in this group; however, improved
  multi-disciplinary care has made infertility a chronic disease complication requiring
  attention. Despite this, there are very few reports and no Australian data describing
  fertility and pregnancy outcomes in this population. AIMS: To identify the rate
  of assisted reproductive technologies (ART) utilisation in our female transfusion-dependent
  haemoglobinopathy patients and to establish the nature of maternal and neonatal
  complications in this cohort. METHODS: A 20-year retrospective analysis (1997-2017)
  at an Australian centre captured data on conception rates, use of assisted reproductive
  techniques (ART), and pregnancy and neonatal outcomes in female transfusion-dependent
  haemoglobinopathy patients. RESULTS: Conception was attempted in 14 women (11 TDT
  and three SCD) during the study period. A total of 28 pregnancies resulting in 25
  live births were recorded. ART supported 13 conceptions. A positive association
  was not identified between elevated mean serum ferritin and ART use; however, all
  patients with an established diagnosis of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) required
  ART. Maternal complications included gestational diabetes mellitus and post-partum
  haemorrhage. There were no cardiac complications. Two-thirds of women underwent
  lower segment caesarean section, with prematurity complicating 20% of births. There
  were no neonatal or maternal deaths. CONCLUSION: Pregnancy is an achievable goal
  for women with transfusion-dependent haemoglobinopathies, although the support of
  ART may be required in a subset of patients.'
