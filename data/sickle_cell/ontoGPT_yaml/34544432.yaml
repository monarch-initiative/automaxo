input_text: 'Vaso-occlusive crisis in sickle cell disease: a vicious cycle of secondary
  events. Painful vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) remains the most common reason for presenting
  to the Emergency Department and hospitalization in patients with sickle cell disease
  (SCD). Although two new agents have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration
  for treating SCD, they both target to reduce the frequency of VOC. Results from
  studies investigating various approaches to treat and shorten VOC have so far been
  generally disappointing. In this paper, we will summarize the complex pathophysiology
  and downstream events of VOC and discuss the likely reasons for the disappointing
  results using monotherapy. We will put forward the rationale for exploring some
  of the currently available agents to either protect erythrocytes un-involved in
  the hemoglobin polymerization process from sickling induced by the secondary events,
  or a multipronged combination approach that targets the complex downstream pathways
  of VOC.'
