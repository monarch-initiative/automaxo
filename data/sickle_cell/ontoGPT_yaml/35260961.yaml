input_text: 'Pragmatic Clinical Trial to Improve Patient Experience Among Adults During
  Transitions from Hospital to Home: the PArTNER study. INTRODUCTION: Minority-serving
  hospitals (MSHs) need evidence-based strategies tailored to the populations they
  serve to improve patient-centered outcomes after hospitalization. METHODS: We conducted
  a pragmatic randomized clinical trial (RCT) from October 2014 to January 2017 at
  a MSH comparing the effectiveness of a stakeholder-supported Navigator intervention
  vs. Usual care on post-hospital patient experience, outcomes, and healthcare utilization.
  Community health workers and peer coaches delivered the intervention which included
  (1) in-hospital visits to assess barriers to health/healthcare and to develop a
  personalized Discharge Patient Education Tool (DPET); (2) a home visit to review
  the DPET; and (3) telephone-based peer coaching. The co-primary outcomes were between-group
  comparisons of 30-day changes in Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information
  System (PROMIS) measures of anxiety and informational support (minimum important
  difference is 2 to 5 units change); a p-value <0.025 was considered significant
  using intention-to-treat analysis. Secondary outcomes included death, ED visits,
  or readmissions and measures of emotional, social, and physical health at 30 and
  60 days. RESULTS: We enrolled 1029 adults hospitalized with heart failure (28%),
  pneumonia (22%), MI (10%), COPD (11%), or sickle cell disease (29%). Over 80% were
  non-Hispanic Black. Overall, there were no significant between-group differences
  in the 30-day change in anxiety (adjusted difference: -1.6, 97.5% CI -3.3 to 0.1,
  p=0.03), informational support (adjusted difference: -0.01, 97.5% CI -2.0 to 1.9,
  p=0.99), or any secondary outcomes. Exploratory analyses suggested the Navigator
  intervention improved anxiety among participants with COPD, a primary care provider,
  a hospitalization in the past 12 months, or higher baseline anxiety; among participants
  without health insurance, the intervention improved informational support (all p-values
  <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In this pragmatic RCT at a MSH, the Navigator intervention
  did not improve post-hospital anxiety, informational support, or other outcomes
  compared to Usual care. Benefits observed in participant subgroups should be confirmed
  in future studies. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT02114515.'
