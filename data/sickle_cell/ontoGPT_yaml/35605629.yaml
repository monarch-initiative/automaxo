input_text: "Post-discharge morbidity and mortality in children admitted with severe
  anaemia and other health conditions in malaria-endemic settings in Africa: a systematic
  review and meta-analysis.BACKGROUND: Severe anaemia is associated with high in-hospital
  mortality among young children. In malaria-endemic areas, surviving children also
  remain at increased risk of mortality for several months after hospital discharge.
  We aimed to compare the risks of morbidity and mortality among children discharged
  from hospital after recovery from severe anaemia versus other health conditions
  in malaria-endemic settings in Africa. METHODS: Following PRISMA guidelines, we
  searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central from inception to
  Nov 30, 2021, without language restrictions, for prospective or retrospective cohort
  studies and randomised controlled trials that followed up children younger than
  15 years for defined periods after hospital discharge in malaria-endemic countries
  in Africa. We excluded the intervention groups in trials and studies or subgroups
  involving children with sickle cell anaemia, malignancies, or surgery or trauma,
  or those reporting follow-up data that were combined with the in-hospital period.
  Two independent reviewers extracted the data and assessed the quality and risk of
  bias using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale or the Cochrane Collaboration's tool. The
  coprimary outcomes were all-cause death and all-cause readmissions 6 months after
  discharge. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42017079282. FINDINGS: Of
  2930 articles identified in our search, 27 studies were included. For children who
  were recently discharged following hospital admission with severe anaemia, all-cause
  mortality by 6 months was higher than during the in-hospital period (n=5 studies;
  Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio 1 72, 95% CI 1 22-2 44; p=0 0020; I2=51 5%) and more
  than two times higher than children previously admitted without severe anaemia (n=4
  studies; relative risk [RR] 2 69, 95% CI 1 59-4 53; p<0 0001; I2=69 2%). Readmissions
  within 6 months of discharge were also more common in children admitted with severe
  anaemia than in children admitted with other conditions (n=1 study; RR 3 05, 1 12-8
  35; p<0 0001). Children admitted with severe acute malnutrition (regardless of severe
  anaemia) also had a higher 6-month mortality after discharge than those admitted
  for other reasons (n=2 studies; RR=3 12, 2 02-4 68; p<0 0001; I2=54 7%). Other predictors
  of mortality after discharge included discharge against medical advice, HIV, bacteraemia,
  and hypoxia. INTERPRETATION: In malaria-endemic settings in Africa, children admitted
  to hospital with severe anaemia and severe acute malnutrition are at increased risk
  of mortality in the first 6 months after discharge compared with children admitted
  with other health conditions. Improved strategies are needed for the management
  of these high-risk groups during the period after discharge. FUNDING: Research Council
  of Norway and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."
