input_text: 'Development of a Flow Phantom for Transcranial Doppler Ultrasound Quality
  Assurance.Anecdotal evidence was recently brought to our attention suggesting a
  potential difference in velocity estimates between transcranial Doppler (TCD) systems
  when measuring high velocities (~200 cm/s) close to the threshold for sickle cell
  disease stroke prevention. As we were unable to identify a suitable commercial TCD
  phantom, a middle cerebral artery (MCA) flow phantom was developed to evaluate velocity
  estimates from different devices under controlled conditions. Time-averaged velocity
  estimates were obtained using two TCD devices: a Spencer Technologies ST3 Doppler
  system (ST3 PMD150, Spencer Technologies, Seattle, WA, USA) and a DWL Dopplerbox
  (DWL Compumedics, SN-300947, Singen, Germany). These were compared with velocity
  estimates obtained using a Zonare duplex scanner (Zonare Medical Systems, Mountain
  View, CA, USA), with timed collection of fluid as the gold standard. Bland-Altman
  analysis was performed to compare measurements between devices. Our tests confirmed
  that velocities measured with the DWL TCD system were +4.1 cm/s (+3.7%; limits of
  agreement [LoA]: 2%, 5%; p = 0.03) higher than the Spencer system when measuring
  a velocity 110 cm/s and +12 cm/s higher (+5.7 %; LoA: 4.8%, 6.6%; p = 0.03) when
  measuring velocities of 210 cm/s, close to the diagnostic threshold for stroke intervention.
  We found our MCA phantom to be a valuable tool for systematically quantifying differences
  in TCD velocity estimates between devices, confirming that the DWL system gave consistently
  higher readings than the Spencer ST3 system. Differences become more pronounced
  at high velocities, which explains why they were not identified earlier. Our findings
  have clinical implications for centers using TCD to monitor patients with sickle
  cell disease, as extra care may be needed to adjust for bias between manufacturers
  when making treatment decisions about children with sickle cell with velocities
  close to the diagnostic threshold.'
