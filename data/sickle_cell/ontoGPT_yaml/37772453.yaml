input_text: "The association of sickle cell disorder with adverse outcomes in COVID-19
  patients: A meta-analysis.The aim is to elucidate the relationship between sickle
  cell disorder and severe COVID-19. We systematically searched the required articles
  in three electronic databases, extracting and pooling effect sizes (ES) and 95%
  confidence interval (CI) from each eligible study to evaluate the effect of combined
  sickle cell disorder on adverse consequences in patients with COVID-19. This meta-analysis
  included 21 studies. Sickle cell disease (SCD) was a risk factor for mortality (pooled
  ES = 1.70, 95% CI: 1.00-2.92, p = 0.001), hospitalization (pooled ES = 6.21, 95%
  CI: 3.60-10.70, p = 0.000) and intensive care unit (ICU) admission (pooled ES =
  2.29, 95% CI: 1.61-3.24, p = 0.099) in COVID-19 patients. Patients with SCD had
  an increased risk of respiratory failure/mechanical ventilation, but a statistical
  association was not found (pooled ES = 1.21, 95%CI: 0.74-1.98, p = 0.036). There
  was significant heterogeneity between SCD and death, hospitalization, and respiratory
  failure/mechanical ventilation. The results of meta-regression of SCD and hospitalization
  suggested that the tested variables including Area (p = 0.642), study design (p
  = 0.739), sample size (p = 0.397), proportion of males (p = 0.708), effect type
  (p = 0.723), whether confounding factors are adjusted (p = 0.606) might not be the
  source of heterogeneity. In addition, sickle cell trait (SCT) was significantly
  associated with the mortality (pooled ES = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.28-1.85, p = 0.771) and
  hospitalization (pooled ES = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.07-1.35,p = 0.519) in patients with
  COVID-19. But any increased risk of ICU admission/severe (pooled ES = 1.24, 95%
  CI: 0.95-1.62, p = 0.520) and mechanical ventilation (OR = 1.00, 95%CI:0.59-1.69)
  in COVID-19 patients with SCT was not observed. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated
  that the results were robust. The results of the funnel plot and Egger's test did
  not support the existence of publication bias. Current meta-analysis indicated that
  sickle cell disorder has a meaningful impact on COVID-19 progression to severe cases
  and associated deaths. However, further investigations and research to validate
  the current findings is indispensable."
