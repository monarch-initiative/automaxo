input_text: 'Associations of hemolysis and anemia with cardiopulmonary dysfunction
  in an adult sickle cell disease cohort.BACKGROUND: Hemolysis contributes to the
  anemia of sickle cell disease (SCD). Hemolysis and anemia are distinct but inter-related
  pathophysiological processes that underlie end-organ dysfunction in this condition.
  We hypothesized that real-world medical tests would reveal distinct contributions
  of hemolysis and anemia to certain cardiopulmonary changes in adults with SCD. METHODS:
  We assessed laboratory and clinical tests of cardiopulmonary function obtained during
  routine delivery of care in 442 adult SCD patients. We characterized hemolysis by
  the first principal component (PC1) of reticulocyte percent, lactate dehydrogenase
  (LDH), aspartate amino transferase (AST) and total bilirubin- the hemolytic component.
  The relationships of hemoglobin concentration and hemolysis to organ dysfunction
  were analyzed by multiple regression and path analysis to identify independent associations.
  RESULTS: Degree of hemolysis and degree of anemia both associated independently
  with elevated values for left atrial diameter (LAD) and left ventricular end-diastolic
  diameter (LVED), and with lower percent predicted forced expiratory volume in first
  second (FEV1). Degree of hemolysis, but not anemia, associated independently with
  low values for oxygen saturation, forced vital capacity (FVC), and total lung capacity
  (TLC)]. Path analysis reinforced the trend by multiple regression for association
  of both degree of hemolysis and anemia with elevated TRV but not with lower diastolic
  blood pressure. DISCUSSION: Analysis of real-world clinical tests suggest that,
  although they are inter-related, the degrees of hemolysis and of anemia make independent
  contributions to cardiopulmonary dysfunction and that treatments that specifically
  target both aspects of sickle cell disease may be of maximal benefit.'
