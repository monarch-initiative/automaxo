input_text: 'Co-existing sickle cell anaemia and inflammatory bowel disease: case
  report and review of the literature. Sickle cell anaemia (SCA) is a chronic haemolytic
  anaemia associated with vaso-occlusive painful crises which may affect several systems
  including the gastro-intestinal system, resulting in abdominal pain. The concurrence
  of inflammatory bowel disease and haemoglobinopathy is rare. No previously reported
  concurrent cases of both SCA and ulcerative colitis (UC) in sub-Saharan Africa were
  found in the literature. A 16-year-old girl with concurrent SCA and UC is presented.
  She was admitted to University College Hospital, Ibadan with a 1-year history of
  recurrent peri-umbilical pain and bloody stools. These symptoms were mainly attributed
  to SCA at the referring hospital, and she was managed for chronic tropical diarrhoea
  without a remarkable clinical response. This case illustrates the concurrent presentation
  of SCA and ulcerative colitis which led to the missed and delayed diagnosis of ulcerative
  colitis.'
