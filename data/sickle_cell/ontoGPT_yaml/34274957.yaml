input_text: "Matched related hematopoietic cell transplant for sickle cell disease
  with alemtuzumab: the Texas Children's Hospital experience. Serotherapeutic agents
  facilitate engraftment and prevent graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) following hematopoietic
  stem cell transplant. Anti-thymocyte globulin is generally added to conditioning
  chemotherapy for matched related donor transplant (MRD-HCT) for sickle cell disease
  (SCD). Alemtuzumab, however, is appealing due to its broad lymphocyte killing that
  may achieve very low rejection and GVHD rates. To assess the impact of alemtuzumab
  in MRD-HCT for SCD, we retrospectively reviewed transplant-related outcomes and
  markers of immunity in 38 consecutive patients at Texas Children's Hospital having
  received myeloablative conditioning with alemtuzumab. Median follow-up was 4.8 years
  (range: 0.2-17). All patients engrafted. Donor chimerism was mixed in 47.1% of patients
  at >=2-years. Donor chimerism <50% was uncommon (n = 2). One patient with low myeloid
  chimerism (19%) had sickle-related hemolysis at 10-years. Incidence of acute GVHD
  grade II-IV (5.3%) and extensive chronic GVHD (2.8%) was very low. Five-year event-free
  survival (EFS) and composite chronic GVHD-EFS were excellent at 94.7% (95% CI: 80.3,
  98.6) and 89.2% (95% CI: 73.7, 95.8), respectively. Infections did not contribute
  to mortality although cytomegalovirus reactivation occurred commonly in the first
  3 months after transplant. Our data suggest potential for alemtuzumab in myeloablative
  transplant for children with SCD although further evaluation in older patients and
  with unrelated donors is warranted."
