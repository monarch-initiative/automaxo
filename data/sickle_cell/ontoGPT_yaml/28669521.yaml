input_text: 'Management of delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction in sickle cell disease:
  Prevention, diagnosis, treatment. Transfusion remains a key treatment of sickle
  cell disease complications. However, delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction, the
  most serious complication of transfusion, may be life-threatening if hyperhemolysis
  develops. This syndrome is generally underdiagnosed because its biological and clinical
  features resemble those of vaso-occlusive crisis, and red blood cell antibodies
  are frequently absent. Further transfusions may aggravate the symptoms, leading
  to severe multiple organ failure and death. It is therefore essential to prevent,
  diagnose and treat this syndrome efficiently. Prevention is based principally on
  the attenuation of allo-immunization through the provision of extended-matched RBCs
  or the use of rituximab. However, such treatment may be insufficient. Early diagnosis
  might make it possible to implement specific treatments in some cases, thereby avoiding
  the need for secondary transfusion. Diagnosis is dependent on the knowledge of the
  medical staff. Finally, many treatments, including steroids, immunoglobulins, erythropoietin
  and eculizumab, have been used to improve outcome. Improvements in our knowledge
  of the specific features of DHTR in SCD should facilitate management of this syndrome.'
