input_text: 'Newborn screening for sickle cell anemia in Antalya, Turkiye.BACKGROUND:
  In a screening study conducted on adults, the prevalence of sickle cell traits in
  Antalya was found to be 0.24%. Since no screening studies have been conducted in
  the neonatal period in our region, the exact incidence has not been determined.
  In this study, we aim to report our experience of neonatal screening for sickle
  cell disease in Antalya, Turkiye. METHODS: During a 14-month period, 2562 heel prick
  blood samples, taken on filter paper from Akdeniz University Hospital, Antalya Education
  and Research Hospital and Antalya Ataturk State Hospital and four other healthcare
  centers, were studied using the high pressure liquid chromatography method. Blood
  samples were studied using the `Sickle Cell Short Program` test method on a Bio
  Rad Variant device. RESULTS: In the study, no patients with sickle cell disease
  were identified. Four newborns who were sickle cell carriers (0.15%) and two newborns
  who were Hemoglobin D carriers (0.08 %), were found. CONCLUSION: Considering the
  efficiency and cost calculations made as a result of the data obtained from our
  study, it was concluded that sickle cell screening would not be effective in newborns.
  It seems more effective and economical to screen the children of parents, who are
  found to be at risk for Hemoglobin S carriage as a result of premarital tests.'
