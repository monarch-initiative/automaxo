input_text: 'Process and procedural adjustments to improve CD34+ collection efficiency
  of hematopoietic progenitor cell collections in sickle cell disease.BACKGROUND:
  Adequate CD34+ collection efficiency (CE) is critical to achieve target CD34+ cell
  doses in hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) collections. Autologous HPC collection
  in sickle cell disease (SCD) is associated with unstable collection interfaces and
  low CD34+ CEs. We hypothesized that variables specific to SCD, activation of blood
  cells and elevated viscosity, might contribute to these issues and made adjustments
  to the collection process and procedure to address our hypothesis. STUDY DESIGN
  AND METHODS: In two patients with SCD undergoing autologous HPC collection on our
  clinical trial (NCT02193191), we therefore implemented adjustments to the process
  and procedure in the following areas: proximity of RBC exchange to HPC collection,
  the type of anticoagulation, and the packing factor setting. RESULTS: There was
  no collection interface instability. Our CD34+ CE1s were high at 70% and 51%, and
  granulocyte CE, platelet CE, and product granulocyte % were remarkably low. Product
  hematocrits were not as high as previously reported to be required to obtain adequate
  CEs. Interestingly, one HPC product showed a hemoglobin S (HbS) of 91% at the same
  time that the peripheral blood (PB) showed a HbS of 22%. DISCUSSION: Adjustments
  to the HPC collection process and procedure were associated with adequate CD34+
  CEs and low granulocyte and platelet contamination in HPC products from SCD patients.
  Given the discrepancy in the percentage of sickle RBCs in the product versus the
  PB, we hypothesize that CD34+ cells and RBCs may aggregate. Our interventions and
  hypothesis should be further investigated in larger studies.'
