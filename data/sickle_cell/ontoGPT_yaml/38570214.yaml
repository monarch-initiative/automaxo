input_text: Prevention of potential delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction in two
  sickle cell patients using intravenous immunoglobulins and steroids before and after
  red blood cell exchange with antigen positive units and review literature. Emergent
  Red Blood Cell (RBC) exchange is indicated in sickle cell disease (SCD) patients
  with severe acute chest syndrome. However, fully matched RBC units may not be available
  for patients with multiple RBC antibodies. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and
  steroids were reported for preventing potential delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction
  (HTR) in simple transfusion of antigen-positive RBCs. We investigated the efficacy
  and safety of IVIG and steroids in two SCD patients presented with acute chest syndrome
  receiving RBC exchange with multiple incompatible units. The first patient had multiple
  historical alloantibodies, including anti-Jsb, although none of them were reactive.
  IVIG (1 g/kg) was given before and after RBC exchange with methylprednisolone (500
  mg IV) one hour before exchange. Her sickle hemoglobin (HbS) was reduced from 89.4%
  to 17.4% after the exchange with five Jsb-positive units. The patient improved clinically
  without acute or delayed hemolysis. The second patient had reactive anti-Jsb on
  two different admissions 18 months apart. Only one of the sixteen units used in
  the exchanges was Jsb negative. He received the same IVIG regimen during both admissions
  but 100 mg IV hydrocortisone instead of methylprednisolone. His HbS was reduced
  from 63.4% to 22.4% after the first exchange. Significant clinical improvements
  were achieved after both exchanges. No delayed HTR was observed. Our experience
  of these two patients suggested that IVIG and steroids may be used in preventing
  potential delayed HTR in some SCD patients with rare antibodies receiving large
  amounts of antigen-positive RBC products.
