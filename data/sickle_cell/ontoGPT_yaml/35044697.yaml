input_text: 'Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is more prevalent in Duffy-null
  red blood cell transfusion in sickle cell disease. BACKGROUND: Resistance to malaria
  infection may be conferred by erythrocyte genetic variations including glucose-6-phosphate
  dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency and lack of Duffy antigens. In red blood cell (RBC)
  transfusion, G6PD deficiency may shorten transfusion survival. Because Duffy-null
  units are commonly transfused in sickle cell disease (SCD) due to antigen matching
  protocols, we examined whether Duffy-null donor RBC units have a higher prevalence
  of G6PD deficiency. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pediatric patients with SCD on chronic
  transfusion therapy were followed prospectively for multiple transfusions. RBC unit
  segments were collected to measure G6PD activity and RBC genotyping. The decline
  in donor hemoglobin (DeltaHbA) following transfusion was assessed from immediate
  posttransfusion estimates and HbA measurements approximately 1 month later. RESULTS:
  Of 564 evaluable RBC units, 59 (10.5%) were G6PD deficient (23 severe, 36 moderate
  deficiency); 202 (37.6%) units were Duffy-null. G6PD deficiency occurred in 40 (19.8%)
  Duffy-null units versus 15 (4.5%) Duffy-positive units (p < .0001). In univariate
  analysis, the fraction of Duffy-null RBC units per transfusion was associated with
  greater decline in HbA (p = .038); however, in multivariate analysis, severe G6PD
  deficiency (p = .0238) but not Duffy-null RBC (p = .0139) were associated with DeltaHbA.
  CONCLUSION: Selection of Duffy-null RBC units may result in shorter in vivo survival
  of transfused RBCs due to a higher likelihood of transfusing units from G6PD deficient
  donors.'
