input_text: Evaluation of Mono- and Bi-Functional GLOBE-Based Vectors for Therapy
  of beta-Thalassemia by HBBAS3 Gene Addition and Mutation-Specific RNA Interference.
  Therapy via the gene addition of the anti-sickling betaAS3-globin transgene is potentially
  curative for all beta-hemoglobinopathies and therefore of particular clinical and
  commercial interest. This study investigates GLOBE-based lentiviral vectors (LVs)
  for betaAS3-globin addition and evaluates strategies for an increased beta-like
  globin expression without vector dose escalation. First, we report the development
  of a GLOBE-derived LV, GLV2-betaAS3, which, compared to its parental vector, adds
  anti-sickling action and a transcription-enhancing 848-bp transcription terminator
  element, retains high vector titers and allows for superior beta-like globin expression
  in primary patient-derived hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Second,
  prompted by our previous correction of HBBIVSI-110(G>A) thalassemia based on RNApol(III)-driven
  shRNAs in mono- and combination therapy, we analyzed a series of novel LVs for the
  RNApol(II)-driven constitutive or late-erythroid expression of HBBIVSI-110(G>A)-specific
  miRNA30-embedded shRNAs (shRNAmiR). This included bifunctional LVs, allowing for
  concurrent betaAS3-globin expression. LVs were initially compared for their ability
  to achieve high beta-like globin expression in HBBIVSI-110(G>A)-transgenic cells,
  before the evaluation of shortlisted candidate LVs in HBBIVSI-110(G>A)-homozygous
  HSPCs. The latter revealed that beta-globin promoter-driven designs for monotherapy
  with HBBIVSI-110(G>A)-specific shRNAmiRs only marginally increased beta-globin levels
  compared to untransduced cells, whereas bifunctional LVs combining miR30-shRNA with
  betaAS3-globin expression showed disease correction similar to that achieved by
  the parental GLV2-betaAS3 vector. Our results establish the feasibility of high
  titers for LVs containing the full HBB transcription terminator, emphasize the importance
  of the HBB terminator for the high-level expression of HBB-like transgenes, qualify
  the therapeutic utility of late-erythroid HBBIVSI-110(G>A)-specific miR30-shRNA
  expression and highlight the exceptional potential of GLV2-betaAS3 for the treatment
  of severe beta-hemoglobinopathies.
