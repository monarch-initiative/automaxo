input_text: How we manage iron overload in sickle cell patients. Blood transfusion
  plays a prominent role in the management of patients with sickle cell disease (SCD),
  but causes significant iron overload. As transfusions are used to treat the severe
  complications of SCD, it remains difficult to distinguish whether organ damage is
  a consequence of iron overload or is due to the complications treated by transfusion.
  Better management has resulted in increased survival, but prolonged exposure to
  iron puts SCD patients at greater risk for iron-related complications that should
  be treated. The success of chelation therapy is dominated by patient adherence to
  prescribed treatment; thus, adjustment of drug regimens to increase adherence to
  treatment is critical. This review will discuss the current biology of iron homeostasis
  in patients with SCD and how this informs our clinical approach to treatment. We
  will present the clinical approach to treatment of iron overload at our centre using
  serial assessment of organ iron by magnetic resonance imaging.
