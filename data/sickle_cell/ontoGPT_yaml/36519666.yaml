input_text: 'Reconsidering sickle cell trait testing of red blood cell units allocated
  to children with sickle cell disease. BACKGROUND: Sickle cell trait (SCT) testing
  of red blood cell (RBC) units is sometimes performed to identify and divert units
  containing hemoglobin S (HbS). Recipients strategically guarded against this exposure
  include fetuses, neonates, and children with sickle cell disease (SCD). The clinical
  necessity of this practice is unclear. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A one-year audit
  (2018) was performed at a pediatric tertiary care hospital that tests for SCT in
  RBC units prescribed to children with SCD and neonates. The impact of incorporating
  varying numbers of SCT RBC units in a single-unit top-up, partial-manual red cell
  exchange, and automated erythrocytapheresis was modeled in four typical-parameter
  age scenarios (2, 5, 10, and 18 years) sharing a high baseline HbS. Additionally,
  a survey assessing SCT testing practices was administered to Canadian pediatric
  hospital transfusion laboratories serving hemoglobinopathy programs. RESULTS: Of
  2268 donor RBC units tested, one was positive for SCT (0.04% [95% CI: 0.01%-0.24%]),
  at a cost of $19,384.56 CAD. The impact of SCT unit incorporation on lost HbS reduction
  was modest (Delta1%-3% [automated erythrocytapheresis] and Delta4%-15% [top-up/partial
  manual exchange]). The survey (with all 13 sites responding) showed variable SCT
  testing practice; four (31%) do not test, four (31%) test for children with SCD,
  and six (46%) test for neonates. CONCLUSION: RBC SCT testing may be more costly
  than beneficial or necessary in children with SCD. As of 2019, our transfusion service
  has ceased SCT testing for this population. Further research in the fetal/neonatal
  populations is needed to overturn this entrenched practice.'
