input_text: 'Reevaluation of the medical necessity of washed red blood cell transfusion
  in chronically transfused adults. BACKGROUND: Washing red blood cell (RBC) units
  mitigates severe allergic transfusion reactions. However, washing reduces the time
  to expiration and the effective dose. Automated washing is time- and labor-intensive.
  A shortage of cell processor tubing sets prompted review of medical necessity for
  washed RBC for patients previously thought to require washing. STUDY DESIGN AND
  METHODS: A single-center, retrospective study investigated discontinuing wash RBC
  protocols in chronically transfused adults. In select patients with prior requirements
  for washing, due to a history of allergic transfusion reactions, trials of unwashed
  transfusions were performed. Patient demographic, clinical, laboratory, and transfusion
  data were compiled. The per-unit washing cost was the sum of the tubing set, saline,
  and technical labor costs. RESULTS: Fifteen patients (median age 34 years interquartile
  range [IQR] 23-53 years, 46.7% female) were evaluated. These patients had been transfused
  with a median of 531 washed RBC units (IQR 244-1066) per patient over 12 years (IQR
  5-18 years), most commonly for recurrent, non-severe allergic reactions. There were
  no transfusion reactions with unwashed RBCs aside from one patient with one episode
  of pruritus and another with recurrent pruritus, which was typical even with washed
  RBC. We decreased the mean number of washed RBC units per month by 72.9% (104 +-
  10 vs. 28.2 +- 25.2; p < .0001) and saved US $100.25 per RBC unit. CONCLUSION: Washing
  of RBCs may be safely reconsidered in chronically transfused patients without a
  history of anaphylaxis. Washing should be implemented judiciously due to potential
  lack of necessity and logistical/operational challenges.'
