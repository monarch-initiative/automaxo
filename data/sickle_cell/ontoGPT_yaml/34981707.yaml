input_text: 'Liver Transplant in Hemoglobin SC Disease and Autoimmune Hepatitis: A
  Case Report. Although liver transplant is a life-saving measure for individuals
  with end-stage liver disease, the perioperative management may be challenging in
  individuals with concomitant sickle cell disease. We report a case of a 50-year-old
  man with sickle cell disease genotype SC (HbSC) and cirrhosis secondary to autoimmune
  hepatitis who underwent liver transplant. His postoperative course included upper
  extremity deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, stroke via a patent foramen ovale
  after a line removal, and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. Fortunately,
  he is alive with a functioning graft at 10 months after liver transplant. This case
  highlights the feasibility of liver transplant in sickle cell disease given the
  support of meticulous multidisciplinary care and the unique aspects of autoimmune
  hepatitis and sickle cell disease for liver transplant consideration.'
