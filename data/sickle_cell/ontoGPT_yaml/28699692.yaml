input_text: 'Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor administration among hemoglobin
  S trait donors: A single center experience from the Eastern Mediterranean region.
  BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Assessment of Hemoglobin S trait donors has gained importance
  together with the increased allogeneic peripheral stem cell transplant activity
  for sickle cell disease in the regions where the disease is prevalent. Outcomes
  of Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) administration are obscure for
  hemoglobin S trait donors. This study aims at investigating the incidence of hemoglobin
  S carrier status and outcomes of G-CSF administration among donors who live in Eastern
  Mediterranean region. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The cross-sectional, single-center cohort
  study was performed with 147 donors between January 2013 and March 2017. Prevalence
  of hemoglobin S trait was estimated and subjects with or without Hemogobin S trait
  were compared with regard to stem cell characteristics, early and late clinical
  outcomes after G-CSF administration. RESULTS: Eleven out of 147 donors (7.48%) were
  found as hemoglobin S trait. G-CSF administration was successfully completed and
  yielded good harvesting results in hemoglobin S trait donors. No statistically significant
  difference was found between groups with regard to early and late side effects,
  stem cell characteristics. Blood pressures and QTc values were within normal ranges
  in both groups. Groups were similar with regard to CD34 values. CONCLUSION: G-CSF
  seems safe in hemoglobin S trait donors. Their being eligible as donors would increase
  the chance of the patients for allogeneic stem cell transplantation in high prevalence
  regions. Further studies are required to reveal the safety profile of G-SCF in hemoglobin
  S carriers in different regions.'
