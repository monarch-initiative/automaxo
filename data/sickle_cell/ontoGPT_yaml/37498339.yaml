input_text: 'The use of extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) in treating osteonecrosis
  of the femoral head (AVNFH): a retrospective study. PURPOSE: As most of the cases
  of avascular necrosis (AVN) in Saudi Arabia is seen in young population and as literature
  showed good effect of extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) in reducing pain
  and oedema in avascular necrosis and delaying the need of surgical intervention.
  Our purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of ESWT in reducing pain,
  improving range of motion (ROM) and delaying the surgical intervention in patient
  with AVN of femoral head and compare our results to published literature. MATERIAL
  AND METHODS: We have treated 24 patients, 13 males and 11 females with a mean age
  of 29 years (range 14-48) with 34 hips affected. There were 14 unilateral and ten
  bilateral lesions. In our series 11 out of 24 patients (45.8%) were due to sickle
  cell disease. Other causes included idiopathic in five patients (20.8%), corticosteroids
  use and systemic lupus erythematous in three patients each (12.5% each) and post-traumatic
  AVN in two patients (8.3%). Extracorporeal shock wave therapy was implanted in FICAT
  stage I, II and III. All patients had two sessions of extracorporeal shock wave
  therapy, four to six weeks apart, each with 4000 impulses divided into four points.
  Radiological and MRI assessment were performed at regular time intervals with a
  minimum follow-up of two years. Clinical assessment was based on Visual Analog Scale
  and Harris Hip Score (HHS). The end point outcome measurement was the need for any
  operative intervention. RESULTS: Operative intervention was necessary in eight out
  of 34 hips (23.5%), within an average of 2.5 years (range 1 to 5 years). A hip salvage
  was achieved in 76.5%. Function was improved with the Harris Hip Score from a mean
  of 54.6 to 80.4 (P value using paired t test <= 0.05). Pain assessed with Visual
  Analog Scale improved from 5.73 to 2.75 (P value using paired t test <= 0.05). CONCLUSION:
  We do recommend the use of ESWT in treating AVN of bone whether of femoral head
  or other sites prior to the collapse of the articular surface. Further studies are
  needed to compare using two or more sessions as well as using four or six points
  for ESWT.'
