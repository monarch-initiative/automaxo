input_text: "Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) for pain management
  in sickle cell disease. BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD), one of the most common
  inherited disorders, is associated with vaso-occlusive pain episodes and haemolysis
  leading to recurrent morbidity, hospital admissions and work or school absenteeism.
  The crises are conventionally treated with opioids, non-opioids and other adjuvants
  with the risk of developing complications, addictions and drug-seeking behaviour.
  Different non-pharmacological treatments, such as transcutaneous electrical nerve
  stimulation (TENS) have been used for managing pain in other painful conditions.
  Hence, the efficacy of TENS for managing pain in SCD needs to be reviewed. OBJECTIVES:
  To assess the benefits and harms of TENS for managing pain in people with SCD who
  experience pain crises or chronic pain (or both). SEARCH METHODS: We searched the
  Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Register,
  comprising of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches
  and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings.
  We also searched online trial registries and the reference lists of relevant articles
  and reviews. Date of the last search: 26 Febraury 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included
  randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs, where TENS was evaluated for
  managing pain in people with SCD. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors
  independently assessed the eligibility of the trials identified by the literature
  searches according to the inclusion criteria. Two review authors then independently
  extracted data, assessed for risk of bias using the Cochrane standard tool and rated
  the quality of evidence using the GRADE guidelines. MAIN RESULTS: One double-blind
  cross-over RCT with 22 participants with SCD (aged 12 to 27 years) was eligible
  for inclusion. Following stratification into four pain crises severity grades, participants
  were then randomised to receive TENS or placebo (sham TENS). The trial was concluded
  after 60 treatment episodes (30 treatment episodes of each treatment group). There
  is a lack of clarity regarding the trial design and the analysis of the cross-over
  data. If a participant was allocated to TENS treatment for an episode of pain and
  subsequently returned with a further episode of a similar degree of pain, they would
  then receive the sham TENS treatment (cross-over design). For those experiencing
  a pain episode of a different severity, it is not clear whether they were re-randomised
  or given the alternate treatment. Reporting and analysis was based on the total
  number pain events and not on the number of participants. It is unclear how many
  participants were crossed over from the TENS group to the sham TENS group and vice
  versa. The trial had a high risk of bias regarding random sequence generation and
  allocation concealment; an unclear risk regarding the blinding of participants and
  personnel; and a low risk regarding the blinding of the outcome assessors and selective
  outcome reporting. The trial was small and of very low quality; furthermore, given
  the issue with trial design we were unable to quantitatively analyse the data. Therefore,
  we present only a narrative summary and caution is advised in interpreting the results.
  In relation to our pre-defined primary outcomes, the included trial did not report
  pain relief at two to four weeks post intervention. The trial authors reported that
  no difference was found in the changes in pain ratings (recorded at one hour and
  four hours post intervention) between the TENS and the placebo groups. In relation
  to our secondary outcomes, the analgesic usage during the trial also did not show
  any difference between groups. Given the quality of the evidence, we are uncertain
  whether TENS improves overall satisfaction as compared to sham TENS. The ability
  to cope with activities of daily living was not evaluated. Regarding adverse events,
  although one case of itching was reported in the TENS group, the site and nature
  of itching was not clearly stated; hence it cannot be clearly attributed to TENS.
  Also, two participants receiving 'sham' TENS reported a worsening of pain with the
  intervention. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Since we have only included one small and very
  low-quality trial, with a high risk of bias across several domains, we are unable
  to conclude whether TENS is harmful or beneficial for managing pain in people with
  SCD. There is a need for a well-designed, adequately-powered, RCT to evaluate the
  role of TENS in managing pain in people with SCD."
