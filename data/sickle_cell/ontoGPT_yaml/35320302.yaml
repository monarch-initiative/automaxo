input_text: "Perspectives of individuals with sickle cell disease on barriers to care.
  INTRODUCTION: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited hemoglobinopathy that predominantly
  affects African Americans in the United States. The disease is associated with complications
  leading to high healthcare utilization rates, including emergency department (ED)
  visits and hospitalizations. Optimal SCD care requires a multidisciplinary approach
  involving SCD specialists to ensure preventive care, minimize complications and
  prevent unnecessary ED visits and hospitalizations. However, most individuals with
  SCD receive sub-optimal care or are unaffiliated with care (have not seen an SCD
  specialist). We aimed to identify barriers to care from the perspective of individuals
  with SCD in a multi-state sample. METHODS: We performed a multiple methods study
  consisting of surveys and interviews in three comprehensive SCD centers from March
  to June 2018. Interviews were transcribed and coded, exploring themes around barriers
  to care. Survey questions on the specific themes identified in the interviews were
  analyzed using summary statistics. RESULTS: We administered surveys to 208 individuals
  and conducted 44 in-depth interviews. Barriers to care were identified and classified
  according to ecological level (i.e., individual, family/interpersonal, provider,
  and socio-environmental/organizational level). Individual-level barriers included
  lack of knowledge in self-management and disease severity. Family/interpersonal
  level barriers were inadequate caregiver support and competing life demands. Provider
  level barriers were limited provider knowledge, provider inexperience, poor provider-patient
  relationship, being treated differently, and the provider's lack of appreciation
  of the patient's SCD knowledge. Socio-environmental/organizational level barriers
  included limited transportation, lack of insurance, administrative barriers, poor
  care coordination, and reduced access to care due to limited clinic availability,
  services provided or clinic refusal to provide SCD care. CONCLUSION: Participants
  reported several multilevel barriers to SCD care. Strategies tailored towards reducing
  these barriers are warranted. Our findings may also inform interventions aiming
  to locate and link unaffiliated individuals to care."
