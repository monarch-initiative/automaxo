input_text: 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation in Sickle Cell Disease: A Multidimentional
  Review. While exagamglogene autotemcel (Casgevy) and lovotibeglogene autotemcel
  (Lyfgenia) have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as the
  first cell-based gene therapies for the treatment of patients 12 years of age and
  older with sickle cell disease (SCD), this treatment is not universally accessible.
  Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) has the potential to eradicate
  the symptoms of patients with SCD, but a significant obstacle in HSCT for SCD is
  the availability of suitable donors, particularly human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched
  related donors. Furthermore, individuals with SCD face an elevated risk of complications
  during stem cell transplantation due to SCD-related tissue damage, endothelial activation,
  and inflammation. Therefore, it is imperative to consider optimal conditioning regimens
  and investigate HSCT from alternative donors. This review encompasses information
  on the use of HSCT in patients with SCD, including the indications for HSCT, conditioning
  regimens, alternative donors, and posttransplant outcomes.'
