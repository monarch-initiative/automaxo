input_text: "Blood transfusion for preventing primary and secondary stroke in people
  with sickle cell disease. BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease is one of the commonest
  severe monogenic disorders in the world, due to the inheritance of two abnormal
  haemoglobin (beta globin) genes. Sickle cell disease can cause severe pain, significant
  end-organ damage, pulmonary complications, and premature death. Stroke affects around
  10% of children with sickle cell anaemia (HbSS). Chronic blood transfusions may
  reduce the risk of vaso-occlusion and stroke by diluting the proportion of sickled
  cells in the circulation. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published
  in 2002, and last updated in 2017. OBJECTIVES: To assess risks and benefits of chronic
  blood transfusion regimens in people with sickle cell disease for primary and secondary
  stroke prevention (excluding silent cerebral infarcts). SEARCH METHODS: We searched
  for relevant trials in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974),
  the Transfusion Evidence Library (from 1980), and ongoing trial databases; all searches
  current to 8 October 2019. We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic
  Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 19 September 2019. SELECTION
  CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials comparing red blood cell transfusions as
  prophylaxis for stroke in people with sickle cell disease to alternative or standard
  treatment. There were no restrictions by outcomes examined, language or publication
  status. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility
  and the risk of bias and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: We included five trials (660
  participants) published between 1998 and 2016. Four of these trials were terminated
  early. The vast majority of participants had the haemoglobin (Hb)SS form of sickle
  cell disease. Three trials compared regular red cell transfusions to standard care
  in primary prevention of stroke: two in children with no previous long-term transfusions;
  and one in children and adolescents on long-term transfusion. Two trials compared
  the drug hydroxyurea (hydroxycarbamide) and phlebotomy to long-term transfusions
  and iron chelation therapy: one in primary prevention (children); and one in secondary
  prevention (children and adolescents). The quality of the evidence was very low
  to moderate across different outcomes according to GRADE methodology. This was due
  to the trials being at a high risk of bias due to lack of blinding, indirectness
  and imprecise outcome estimates. Red cell transfusions versus standard care Children
  with no previous long-term transfusions Long-term transfusions probably reduce the
  incidence of clinical stroke in children with a higher risk of stroke (abnormal
  transcranial doppler velocities or previous history of silent cerebral infarct),
  risk ratio 0.12 (95% confidence interval 0.03 to 0.49) (two trials, 326 participants),
  moderate quality evidence. Long-term transfusions may: reduce the incidence of other
  sickle cell disease-related complications (acute chest syndrome, risk ratio 0.24
  (95% confidence interval 0.12 to 0.48)) (two trials, 326 participants); increase
  quality of life (difference estimate -0.54, 95% confidence interval -0.92 to -0.17)
  (one trial, 166 participants); but make little or no difference to IQ scores (least
  square mean: 1.7, standard error 95% confidence interval -1.1 to 4.4) (one trial,
  166 participants), low quality evidence. We are very uncertain whether long-term
  transfusions: reduce the risk of transient ischaemic attacks, Peto odds ratio 0.13
  (95% confidence interval 0.01 to 2.11) (two trials, 323 participants); have any
  effect on all-cause mortality, no deaths reported (two trials, 326 participants);
  or increase the risk of alloimmunisation, risk ratio 3.16 (95% confidence interval
  0.18 to 57.17) (one trial, 121 participants), very low quality evidence. Children
  and adolescents with previous long-term transfusions (one trial, 79 participants)
  We are very uncertain whether continuing long-term transfusions reduces the incidence
  of: stroke, risk ratio 0.22 (95% confidence interval 0.01 to 4.35); or all-cause
  mortality, Peto odds ratio 8.00 (95% confidence interval 0.16 to 404.12), very low
  quality evidence. Several review outcomes were only reported in one trial arm (sickle
  cell disease-related complications, alloimmunisation, transient ischaemic attacks).
  The trial did not report neurological impairment, or quality of life. Hydroxyurea
  and phlebotomy versus red cell transfusions and chelation Neither trial reported
  on neurological impairment, alloimmunisation, or quality of life. Primary prevention,
  children (one trial, 121 participants) Switching to hydroxyurea and phlebotomy may
  have little or no effect on liver iron concentrations, mean difference -1.80 mg
  Fe/g dry-weight liver (95% confidence interval -5.16 to 1.56), low quality evidence.
  We are very uncertain whether switching to hydroxyurea and phlebotomy has any effect
  on: risk of stroke (no strokes); all-cause mortality (no deaths); transient ischaemic
  attacks, risk ratio 1.02 (95% confidence interval 0.21 to 4.84); or other sickle
  cell disease-related complications (acute chest syndrome, risk ratio 2.03 (95% confidence
  interval 0.39 to 10.69)), very low quality evidence. Secondary prevention, children
  and adolescents (one trial, 133 participants) Switching to hydroxyurea and phlebotomy
  may: increase the risk of sickle cell disease-related serious adverse events, risk
  ratio 3.10 (95% confidence interval 1.42 to 6.75); but have little or no effect
  on median liver iron concentrations (hydroxyurea, 17.3 mg Fe/g dry-weight liver
  (interquartile range 10.0 to 30.6)); transfusion 17.3 mg Fe/g dry-weight liver (interquartile
  range 8.8 to 30.7), low quality evidence. We are very uncertain whether switching
  to hydroxyurea and phlebotomy: increases the risk of stroke, risk ratio 14.78 (95%
  confidence interval 0.86 to 253.66); or has any effect on all-cause mortality, Peto
  odds ratio 0.98 (95% confidence interval 0.06 to 15.92); or transient ischaemic
  attacks, risk ratio 0.66 (95% confidence interval 0.25 to 1.74), very low quality
  evidence. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence for managing adults, or children
  who do not have HbSS sickle cell disease. In children who are at higher risk of
  stroke and have not had previous long-term transfusions, there is moderate quality
  evidence that long-term red cell transfusions reduce the risk of stroke, and low
  quality evidence they also reduce the risk of other sickle cell disease-related
  complications. In primary and secondary prevention of stroke there is low quality
  evidence that switching to hydroxyurea with phlebotomy has little or no effect on
  the liver iron concentration. In secondary prevention of stroke there is low-quality
  evidence that switching to hydroxyurea with phlebotomy increases the risk of sickle
  cell disease-related events. All other evidence in this review is of very low quality."
