input_text: 'Acupuncture as an Adjunctive Treatment for Pain in Hospitalized Children
  With Sickle Cell Disease.CONTEXT: Acute episodes of pain associated with sickle
  cell disease (SCD) account for over 100,000 hospitalizations and expenses of nearly
  one billion dollars annually in the U.S. New treatment approaches are needed as
  the current opioid based therapy is often inadequate in controlling pain, resulting
  in prolonged inpatient stays, and high rates of readmission. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate
  acceptability of acupuncture as an adjunctive therapy and explore the impact of
  acupuncture on pain related outcomes in a population of youth with SCD hospitalized
  for management of acute pain. METHODS: This IRB approved single center study recruited
  youth with SCD (9-20 years) who were hospitalized for management of acute pain into
  either the acupuncture group or controls. Both groups also received standard pain
  management therapies. RESULTS: Participants in the acupuncture (n = 19) and control
  (n = 10) group were comparable in clinical characteristics. Acupuncture had an acceptability
  rate of over 66% and was tolerated well without any side effects. Acupuncture was
  associated with reduction in pain scores (6.84-5.51; P < 0.0001). Acupuncture group
  demonstrated a trend toward lower length of stay and readmission rates, but these
  were not statistically significant. Opioid use was not different between the groups.
  Treatment Evaluation Inventory survey showed high rates of satisfaction with acupuncture.
  CONCLUSION: Acupuncture was broadly accepted and well-tolerated in our study population.
  Acupuncture treatment was associated with a statistically significant and clinically
  meaningful reduction in pain scores immediately following the treatments, and a
  trend towards a reduction in length of stay and readmission for pain.'
