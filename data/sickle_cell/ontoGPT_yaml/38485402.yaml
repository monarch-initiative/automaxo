input_text: "[The transition of adolescents with sickle cell disease: an interdisciplinary
  exchange].With the rising incidence of sickle cell disease, this chronic pathology
  is becoming the most common genetic disease in France. Advances in care have led
  to a marked improvement in life expectancy. Caregivers in pediatric facilities are
  therefore increasingly confronted with the question of the transition to adulthood
  of the adolescents they have been following since birth. As nurses working in Robert-Debre's
  transfusion and curative medicine unit, in 2022, adolescents accounted for 57 %
  of sickle cell patients enrolled in our transfusion exchange program. Adolescence
  is a period of major change, and the repercussions of the disease are all the more
  pronounced. This raises the issue of transferring them to the adult sector."
