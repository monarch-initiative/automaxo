input_text: The hope, hype and obstacles surrounding cell therapy. Cell therapy offers
  hope, but it also presents challenges, most particularly the limited ability of
  human organs and tissues to regenerate. Since many diseases are associated with
  irreversible pathophysiological or traumatic changes, stem cells and their derivatives
  are unable to secure healing. Although regenerative medicine offers chances for
  improvements in many diseases, such as type one diabetes and Parkinson's disease,
  it cannot eliminate the primary cause of many of them. While successes can be expected
  for diseases such as sickle cell disease, this is not the case for hereditary diseases
  with varied mutation types or for ciliopathies, which start in embryogenesis. In
  this complicated medical environment, synthetic biology offers some solutions, but
  their implementation will take many years. Still, positive examples such as CAR-T
  therapy offer hope.
