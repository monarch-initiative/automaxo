input_text: 'Adverse pregnancy, fetal and neonatal outcomes in women with sickle cell
  disease in a Middle Eastern country.BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease in pregnancy
  is associated with high maternal and fetal mortality. However, studies reporting
  pregnancy, fetal, and neonatal outcomes in women with sickle cell disease are extremely
  limited. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of the study are to determine whether women
  with sickle cell disease have a greater risk of adverse pregnancy, fetal, and neonatal
  outcomes than women without sickle cell disease and identify the predictors of adverse
  pregnancy, fetal, and neonatal outcomes in women with sickle cell disease. DESIGN:
  A retrospective pair-matched case-control study was conducted to compare 171 pregnant
  women with sickle cell disease to 171 pregnant women without sickle cell disease
  in Muscat, Sultanate of Oman. METHODS: All pregnant Omani women with sickle cell
  disease who delivered between January 2015 and August 2021 at Sultan Qaboos University
  Hospital and Royal Hospital, who were either primipara or multipara and who had
  a gestational age of 24-42 weeks, were included as patients, whereas women who had
  no sickle cell disease or any comorbidity during pregnancy, who delivered within
  the same timeframe and at the same hospitals, were recruited as controls. The data
  were retrieved from electronic medical records and delivery registry books between
  January 2015 and August 2021. RESULTS: Women with sickle cell disease who had severe
  anemia had increased odds of (chi2 = 58.56, p < 0.001) having adverse pregnancy
  outcomes. Women with sickle cell disease had 21.97% higher odds of delivering a
  baby with intrauterine growth retardation (chi2 = 17.80, unadjusted odds ratio =
  2.91-166.13, p < 0.001). Newborns born to women with sickle cell disease had 3.93%
  greater odds of being admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (chi2 = 16.80,
  unadjusted odds ratio = 1.97-7.84, p < 0.001). In addition, the children born to
  women with sickle cell disease had 10.90% higher odds of being born with low birth
  weight (chi2 = 56.92, unadjusted odds ratio = 5.36-22.16, p < 0.001). Hemoglobin
  level (odds ratio = 0.17, p < 0.001, 95% confidence interval = 0.10-3.0), past medical
  history (odds ratio = 7.95, p < 0.001, 95% confidence interval = 2.39-26.43), past
  surgical history (odds ratio = 17.69, p < 0.001, 95% confidence interval = 3.41-91.76),
  and preterm delivery (odds ratio = 9.48, p = 0.005, 95% confidence interval = 1.95-46.23)
  were identified as predictors of adverse pregnancy, fetal, and neonatal outcomes
  in women with sickle cell disease. CONCLUSION: As pregnant women with sickle cell
  disease are at increased risk for pregnancy, fetal, and neonatal adverse outcomes;
  improved antenatal surveillance and management may improve the outcomes.'
