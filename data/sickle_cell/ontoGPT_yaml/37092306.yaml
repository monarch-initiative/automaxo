input_text: 'Revisiting the benefits of isovolemic hemodilution red cell exchange
  for sickle cell disease. BACKGROUND: Isovolemic hemodilution red cell exchange (IHD-RCE)
  is a modified form of the standard red cell exchange (STD-RCE), intended to reduce
  red cell requirements in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). This retrospective
  crossover analysis of nine patients aims to add to the limited existing literature
  on IHD-RCE and address the equipoise regarding whether the benefits of (a) decreased
  RBC usage per exchange and (b) increased interprocedure interval (via lower fraction
  of cells remaining, FCR) can be observed at the same time, in the same patient.
  METHODS: At a single center, we identified 37 patients with SCD undergoing chronic
  RCE between 2014 and 2021. We excluded those patients who did not have at least
  six consecutive procedures of each type (STD- and IHD-RCE), arriving at nine patients
  for analysis. RESULTS: When using greater decreases in hematocrit than previously
  published, we did not find that IHD-RCE resulted in any clinically apparent adverse
  events. We did find greater decreases in diastolic blood pressure and increases
  in heart rate in some patients, as compared to STD-RCE. After correcting for total
  blood volume, seven of the nine patients had significantly reduced red cell requirements
  with each IHD-RCE. Because the pattern of achieving a lower FCR than programmed
  was seen to an equal extent with both IHD-RCE and STD-RCE, none of the nine patients
  showed any statistical difference in actual FCR between procedure types. DISCUSSION:
  Our data do not support the observation of both IHD-RCE benefits, decreased red
  cell usage per exchange and lower FCR/increased interprocedure interval, simultaneously.'
