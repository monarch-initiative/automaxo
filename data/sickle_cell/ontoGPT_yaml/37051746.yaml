input_text: 'Parental perspective on the risk of infertility and fertility preservation
  options for children and adolescents with sickle cell disease considering hematopoietic
  stem cell transplantation. BACKGROUND: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
  (HCT) performed in children from human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical related
  donors is associated with very high survival rates and disease-free survival. Patients
  are exposed to gonadotoxic alkylating agents or irradiation in the HCT conditioning
  regimen. Consequently, infertility is a major long-term complication of HCT for
  sickle cell disease (SCD). We sought to understand how caregivers perceive the risk
  of infertility from HCT, how they perceive the options for fertility preservation,
  and how this risk perception impacted their decision-making to pursue HCT. PROCEDURES:
  We conducted qualitative interviews with primary caregivers after a consultation
  for HCT for SCD. Data were analyzed using descriptive qualitative analysis. RESULTS:
  We interviewed 19 primary caregivers who had attended a consultation with an HCT
  physician (female, age 25-59 [median 39] years). Eleven participants reported that
  their child had an available HLA-matched donor. Analysis revealed that (i) mothers
  were worried about death and graft-versus-host disease from HCT, more than about
  the risk of infertility; (ii) parents have a realistic understanding of the risk
  of infertility after HCT and take it into consideration in decision-making; (iii)
  parents report multiple barriers to fertility preservation. CONCLUSION: For parents
  actively considering HCT for their child with SCD, the risk of infertility while
  important was not a barrier to pursuing HCT. Inconvenience and invasiveness of fertility
  preservation procedures are some of the barriers to pursuing fertility preservation
  for their child. Future research must aim at addressing these barriers to fertility
  preservation.'
