input_text: "Preconception care counselling among women with sickle cell anaemia in
  the south of Iran: a qualitative study based on social marketing model. Pregnancy
  in women afflicted with sickle cell anaemia has certain adverse effects. The present
  research aimed to promote the quality of preconception care counselling programs.
  To do this, Hormozgan Province recruited 25 diseased women and five key informants.
  To acquire the necessary information, in-depth semi-structured interviews were undertaken.
  Graneheim's directions for guided content analysis were followed while analysing
  the data. The results were reported in four categories based on the social marketing
  constructs. Provision of sickle cell services and preconception care counselling
  were suggested. The participants preferred to be interviewed in comprehensive healthcare
  centres in their neighbourhood. The high cost of the lab and medical services was
  raised as an issue. Face-to-face communication together with other care services
  was suggested. Providing consultation services in nearby places as in the neighbourhood,
  including local comprehensive care centres, face-to-face interventions, and mass
  media, can effectively promote preconception care counselling participation.IMPACT
  STATEMENTWhat is already known on this subject? The high rate of maternal mortality
  in women afflicted with sickle cell disease in the south of Iran has attracted growing
  attention to preconception care counselling in these women. It seems that the social
  marketing model, due to its audience-based nature, is effective in the acceptance
  of participatory behaviour in preconception care counselling. To the best of the
  present researchers' knowledge, there is no similar research in this respect in
  Iran.What do the results of this study add? Participants' discourse analysis has
  led to the recognition of the social marketing constituent elements in participation
  in Preconception care counselling. In their accounts, the participants drew attention
  to 'Provision of sickle cell services' and 'Provision of Preconception care counseling
  for sickle cell disease' in their accounts. The participants also mentioned personal,
  organisational, and sociocultural barriers to the rate of participation. The optimal
  place was determined for the consultation, and the means of communication were also
  decided on for implementing the program.What are the implications of these findings
  for clinical practice and/or further research? Policy-makers and programmers can
  use the present findings to guide the design and implementation of interventional
  programs to promote participation in Preconception care counselling for women who
  have sickle cell disease."
