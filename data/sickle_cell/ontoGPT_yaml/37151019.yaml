input_text: 'Self-management for sickle cell disease among patients and parents: A
  qualitative study. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore self-management practices
  among patients and parents of children with sickle cell disease (SCD). METHODS:
  The qualitative descriptive design was employed. The study involved 19 participants
  comprising adult SCD patients >=16 years, and nine parents of SCD children <= 15
  years. Purposive sampling was conducted to select participants from a teaching hospital
  and SCD association. Data was collected using one-on-one interviews, transcribed
  verbatim, and analysed using qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Self-management
  was reported through four categories including preventive health, self-monitoring,
  self-diagnosis, and self-treatment. Hydration, nutrition, activity limitation, avoidance
  of cold temperatures, and supportive medications were the most common preventive
  health actions. Regarding self-monitoring and self-diagnosis, the parents emphasized
  objective indicators such as changes in urine and eye colour compared to the adults
  who utilize subjective indicators such as feeling unwell and easy fatigue. Pharmacological
  and non-pharmacological measures were reported by both groups for treating painful
  episodes, fever, leg ulcers, priapism, and unspecified symptoms. DISCUSSION: The
  participants in this study practice several self-management actions with some differences
  in application between adults and children. Tailored self-management services may
  be helpful for adults and children when developing services for SCD patients.'
