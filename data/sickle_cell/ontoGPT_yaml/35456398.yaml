input_text: Vignette-Based Reflections to Inform Genetic Testing Policies in Living
  Kidney Donors. Family history of kidney disease increases risk of end-stage kidney
  disease (ESKD) in donors. Pre-donation genetic testing is recommended in evaluation
  guidelines and regulatory policy. Collaborating across several institutions, we
  describe cases to illustrate the utility as well as practical issues in incorporating
  genetic testing in transplant protocols. Case 1 is from 2009, before pervasive genetic
  testing. A healthy 27-year-old Caucasian male had an uneventful donor evaluation
  for his mother, who had early onset ESKD of unclear cause. He participated in paired-exchange
  kidney donation, but developed progressive kidney disease and gout over the next
  10 years. A uromodulin gene mutation (NM_003361.3(UMOD):c.377 G>A p.C126Y) was detected
  and kidney biopsy showed tubulointerstitial kidney disease. The patient subsequently
  required kidney transplantation himself. Case 2 was a 36-year-old African American
  female who had an uneventful kidney donor evaluation. She underwent gene panel-based
  testing to rule out ApolipoproteinL1 risk variants, for which was negative. Incidentally,
  a sickle-cell trait (NM_000518.5(HBB):c.20A>T p.Glu7Val) was noted, and she was
  declined for kidney donation. This led to significant patient anguish. Case 3 was
  a 26-year-old Caucasian female who underwent panel-based testing because the potential
  recipient, her cousin, carried a variant of uncertain significance in the hepatocyte
  nuclear factor-1-beta (HNF1B) gene. While the potential donor did not harbor this
  variant, she was found to have a likely pathogenic variant in complement factor
  I (NM_000204.4(CFI):c.1311dup:p.Asp438Argfs*8), precluding kidney donation. Our
  cases emphasize that while genetic testing can be invaluable in donor evaluation,
  transplant centers should utilize detailed informed consent, develop care pathways
  for secondary genetic findings, and share experience to develop best practices around
  genetic testing in donors.
