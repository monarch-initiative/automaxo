input_text: 'Sickle Cell Trait and SARS-CoV-2-Induced Rhabdomyolysis: A Case Report.BACKGROUND
  Rhabdomyolysis is a syndrome characterized by muscle necrosis and the subsequent
  release of intracellular muscle constituents into the bloodstream. Although the
  specific cause is frequently evident from the history or from the immediate events,
  such as a trauma, extraordinary physical exertion, or a recent infection, sometimes
  there are hidden risk factors that have to be identified. For instance, individuals
  with sickle cell trait (SCT) have been reported to be at increased risk for rare
  conditions, including rhabdomyolysis. Moreover, there have been a few case reports
  of SARS-CoV-2 infection-related rhabdomyolysis. CASE REPORT We present a case of
  a patient affected by unknown SCT and admitted with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, who suffered
  non-traumatic non-exertional rhabdomyolysis leading to acute kidney injury (AKI),
  requiring acute hemodialysis (HD). The patients underwent 13 dialysis session, of
  which 12 were carried out using an HFR-Supra H dialyzer. He underwent kidney biopsy,
  where rhabdomyolysis injury was ascertained. No viral traces were found on kidney
  biopsy samples. The muscle biopsy showed the presence of an "open nucleolus" in
  the muscle cell, which was consistent with virus-infected cells. After 40 days in
  the hospital, his serum creatinine was 1.62 mg/dL and CPK and Myoglobin were 188
  U/L and 168 ng/mL, respectively; therefore, the patient was discharged. CONCLUSIONS
  SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in severe rhabdomyolysis with AKI requiring acute
  HD. Since SARS-CoV-2 infection can trigger sickle-related complications like rhabdomyolysis,
  the presence of SCT needs to be ascertained in African patients.'
