input_text: 'Increased non-typhoidal Salmonella hospitalizations in transfusion-naive
  thalassemia children: a nationwide population-based cohort study.INTRODUCTION: Although
  non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) infection usually causes self-limited enterocolitis,
  several risk factors have been found to predispose individuals to more severe NTS
  infections. However, few studies have discussed the association between NTS infection
  and pediatric thalassemia populations. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A nationwide population-based
  retrospective cohort study was conducted using medical records of the selected children
  from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. Immunocompromised individuals
  or patients with a history of transfusion or splenectomy were excluded. One thalassemia
  patient was matched with four non-thalassemia patients based on their year of birth,
  sex, and urbanization level. RESULTS: In this cohort, 912 patients with thalassemia
  and 3648 comparison cohort were analyzed. The mean age of NTS hospitalization was
  2.0 +- 1.4 in thalassemia cohort and 2.6 +- 2.4 in non-thalassemia cohort. Transfusion-naive
  thalassemia children were proved to have a higher rate of NTS hospitalization (6.90
  vs 4.11 per 1000 person-year; p = 0.0004) than the non-thalassemia cohort, with
  an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.68 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.26-2.24).
  CONCLUSION: Our research shows that transfusion-naive thalassemia is associated
  with an increased risk of NTS hospitalization. Further prospective study comparing
  the incidence and severity of NTS infection among children with and without thalassemia
  is needed. IMPACT: Pediatric transfusion-naive thalassemia patients have an 1.68-fold
  increased risk for hospitalization due to non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) infection.
  This is the first nationwide population-based cohort study based on an extremely
  large database that shows pediatric transfusion-naive thalassemia patients have
  an increased risk for NTS hospitalizations. Besides the previously known risk factors
  such as extremes of age, sickle cell disease, or immunosuppressing conditions, clinicians
  must also take thalassemia as a possible risk factor for more severe NTS disease.'
