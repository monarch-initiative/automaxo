  Pain Related to Vaso-occlusive Sickle Cell Crises in Children: A Prospective Multicenter
  Clinical Study. BACKGROUND: The management of neuropathic pain and pain related
  to bone vaso-occlusive crises in sickle cell disease remains challenging in children.
  Lidocaine 5% patches are recommended in adults for neuropathic pain treatment, but
  they are not recommended in children. The purpose of this study was to assess the
  efficacy and tolerance of lidocaine 5% patches in pediatric inpatients. METHODS:
  This prospective, multicenter, single-arm, phase II study aimed to assess the use
  of lidocaine 5% patches in 6- to 21-year-old pediatric patients suffering from neuropathic
  pain or superficial bone vaso-occlusive crises. Patches were applied on the painful
  area for 12 hours a day. The primary endpoint was the proportion of inpatients with
  significant pain relief defined as a decrease of at least 2 points on the visual
  analog pain scale (VAS) measured at 12 hours after patch placement over at least
  2 consecutive days. RESULTS: The 12-hour VAS score decreased by at least 2 points
  over 2 consecutive days in 48.6% of patients 95% unilateral confidence interval
  (33.8%). Only 7.7% of patients experienced grade 1 or grade 2 toxicities. CONCLUSION:
  Although lidocaine 5% patches decreased the pain's intensity in nearly half of the
  enrolled patients with an excellent tolerance, the efficacy endpoint was not reached.
  Further studies should consider a more refined selection of the experimental population
  to assess the efficacy of lidocaine 5% patches in the pediatric population."
