input_text: Diverse Approaches to Gene Therapy of Sickle Cell Disease. Sickle cell
  disease (SCD) results from a single base pair change in the sixth codon of the beta-globin
  chain of hemoglobin, which promotes aggregation of deoxyhemoglobin, increasing rigidity
  of red blood cells and causing vaso-occlusive and hemolytic complications. Allogeneic
  transplant of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) can eliminate SCD manifestations but
  is limited by absence of well-matched donors and immune complications. Gene therapy
  with transplantation of autologous HSCs that are gene-modified may provide similar
  benefits without the immune complications. Much progress has been made, and patients
  are realizing significant clinical improvements in multiple trials using different
  approaches with lentiviral vector-mediated gene addition to inhibit hemoglobin aggregation.
  Gene editing approaches are under development to provide additional therapeutic
  opportunities. Gene therapy for SCD has advanced from an attractive concept to clinical
  reality.
