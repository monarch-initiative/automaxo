input_text: 'Influenza immunization coverage of children with sickle cell disease.
  OBJECTIVES: To assess receipt of annual flu immunization among children living with
  sickle cell disease (SCD). METHODS: Receipt of flu immunization (2014-2019) by SCD
  status was assessed among all Michigan children <18 years of age using the statewide
  immunization registry. Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds of annual
  flu immunization by SCD status and age. RESULTS: Annual flu immunization coverage
  was higher among children with SCD (46.9%; n = 751) than without (23.2%; n = 2,012,846).
  The annual adjusted odds of flu immunization for those with SCD were 2.8 (95% CI:
  2.5-3.1) times higher than for those without SCD; there were no significant differences
  by age among children with SCD. Among those without SCD, adolescents aged 13-17
  were 2.2 (95% CI: 2.2-2.2) times less likely to receive annual flu immunization
  than children 6-35 months. CONCLUSIONS: Children with SCD had higher annual flu
  immunization rates than those without SCD, but >50% remain unimmunized.'
