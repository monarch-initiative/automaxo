input_text: "Integrative holistic approaches for children, adolescents, and young
  adults with sickle cell disease: A single center experience.CONTEXT: Painful vaso-occlusive
  crises (VOCs) associated with sickle cell disease (SCD) are the most common cause
  of morbidity, hospitalizations, and poor quality of life. Additional symptoms such
  as sleep disturbances, fatigue, and stress are also common. Non-traditional approaches
  are often used by families, but concerns remain that patients may forgo standard
  of care effective therapies in favor of dangerous unproven alternatives. OBJECTIVES:
  To describe a single center experience related to a multidisciplinary integrative
  medicine clinic within the division of hematology dedicated to children and young
  adults with SCD. METHODS: The Sickle Cell Integrative Clinic at Children's National
  Hospital services patients with SCD. The main goal of this clinic is to provide
  access to non-pharmacologic interventions, and to manage patients' symptoms in a
  holistic manner along with standard of care management of SCD. This IRB approved
  study evaluated experiences of both patients and parents who attended this clinic.
  RESULTS: Thirty-seven unique patients attended this clinic over 2 years and 31 participated
  in the study. After attending the SCD integrative clinic, the majority of patients
  reported integrative therapies to be an acceptable way of treating pain and believed
  these to be effective. Overall, the vast majority (88 %) of patients reported having
  a positive experience with the therapies offered in the clinic. None of the patients
  experienced any adverse events related to integrative therapies provided in the
  clinic. CONCLUSION: Our experience suggests that encouraging conversations and offering
  safe and potentially effective integrative therapies alongside conventional SCD
  therapies under medical guidance allows patients to have an open discussion about
  their beliefs and treatment goals, improves patient satisfaction and can improve
  outcomes."
