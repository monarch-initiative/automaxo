input_text: In vitro assessment of the anti-sickling properties of Buchholzia coriacea
  and Mucuna pruriens seed extracts. Sickle cell disease is a group of diseases inherited
  through the gene and it affects the haemoglobin in the red blood cell. This study
  investigated the methanol seed extract of Buchholzia coriacea for possible in vitro
  anti-sickling effects and also determined the effect of Mucuna pruriens seed extract
  on the solubility and oxygen-binding rate of sickle cell haemoglobin. Sickle cell
  blood was collected from sickle cell disease patients with subsequent addition of
  2% sodium metabisulphite to cause more sickling. Varying concentrations of the seed
  extracts (50%, 25%, 12.5% and 6.25%) were added to the pre-treated blood for these
  in vitro assays. The results showed that the extract of Buchholzia coriacea significantly
  (P < 0.05) inhibited sickling at all concentrations with the highest percentage
  inhibition of 73.3 +- 5.8, reversed sickled erythrocytes at all concentrations with
  the highest percentage reversal of 83.3 +- 5.8 and significantly (P < 0.05) inhibited
  polymerisation at all concentrations used in comparison to the parallel control.
  The extract of Mucuna pruriens seed significantly (P < 0.05) increased the solubility
  of sickle haemoglobin at 50%, 25%, 12.5% and 6.25% concentrations, increased Fe2+/Fe3+
  ratio from 1.7 (control) to 12.2 (50% concentration) and reduced osmotic fragility
  (at 12.5% and 6.25% concentrations) when compared with parallel control. The results
  indicate the feasibility of the seed extracts as promising agents in the management
  of sickle cell disease.
