input_text: "Key role of pediatricians and disease for influenza vaccination in children
  with high-risk chronic diseases. Annual influenza vaccination is recommended for
  children with chronic diseases. Studies on influenza vaccines, following controversies
  related to the 2009 H1N1 influenza, are scarce in Europe. Our aim was to evaluate
  the influenza vaccination coverage in such children in a French tertiary hospital.
  Secondary objectives were the evaluation of the influenza vaccination coverage trend
  and the identification of factors influencing the vaccination status. A prospective
  and descriptive study by questionnaire was performed at the end of 2017 in 402 French
  hospital outpatients with various underlying chronic diseases eligible to the influenza
  vaccination. The 2016-2017 vaccination coverage was 46.5%. Figures of 75% or greater
  were only found in patients with cystic fibrosis and sickle cell disease. CART analysis
  identified vaccination in the previous year, medical recommendation for vaccination,
  and maternal influenza vaccination as a child's decisive factors for being vaccinated.Conclusion:
  Influenza vaccination coverage remains insufficient in children receiving hospital
  follow-up for chronic diseases. Its implementation clearly depends on pediatricians'
  recommendation to vaccinate and on the type of chronic disease. What is Known: \
  \  Despite health policy recommendations, the rate of annual influenza vaccination
  in children with chronic diseases is low What is New:   Influenza vaccination coverage
  depends on the type of chronic disease and on the pediatricians' counseling to vaccine."
