input_text: 'Screening for autosomal recessive and X-linked conditions during pregnancy
  and preconception: a practice resource of the American College of Medical Genetics
  and Genomics (ACMG).Carrier screening began 50 years ago with screening for conditions
  that have a high prevalence in defined racial/ethnic groups (e.g., Tay-Sachs disease
  in the Ashkenazi Jewish population; sickle cell disease in Black individuals). Cystic
  fibrosis was the first medical condition for which panethnic screening was recommended,
  followed by spinal muscular atrophy. Next-generation sequencing allows low cost
  and high throughput identification of sequence variants across many genes simultaneously.
  Since the phrase "expanded carrier screening" is nonspecific, there is a need to
  define carrier screening processes in a way that will allow equitable opportunity
  for patients to learn their reproductive risks using next-generation sequencing
  technology. An improved understanding of this risk allows patients to make informed
  reproductive decisions. Reproductive decision making is the established metric for
  clinical utility of population-based carrier screening. Furthermore, standardization
  of the screening approach will facilitate testing consistency. This practice resource
  reviews the current status of carrier screening, provides answers to some of the
  emerging questions, and recommends a consistent and equitable approach for offering
  carrier screening to all individuals during pregnancy or preconception.'
