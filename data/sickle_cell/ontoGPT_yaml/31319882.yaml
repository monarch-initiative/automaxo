input_text: 'Prevention of Morbidity in Sickle Cell Disease (POMS2a)-overnight auto-adjusting
  continuous positive airway pressure compared with nocturnal oxygen therapy: a randomised
  crossover pilot study examining patient preference and safety in adults and children.
  DESIGN: This randomised crossover trial compared nocturnal auto-adjusting continuous
  positive airway pressure (APAP) and nocturnal oxygen therapy (NOT) in adults and
  children with sickle cell anaemia, with patient acceptability as the primary outcome.
  Secondary outcomes included pulmonary physiology (adults), safety, and daily pain
  during interventions and washout documented using tablet technology. METHODS: Inclusion
  criteria were age > 8 years and the ability to use an iPad to collect daily pain
  data. Trial participation was 4 weeks; week 1 involved baseline data collection
  and week 3 was a washout between interventions, which were administered for 7 days
  each during weeks 2 and 4 in a randomised order. Qualitative interviews were transcribed
  verbatim and analysed for content using a funnelling technique, starting generally
  and then gaining more detailed information on the experience of both interventions.
  Safety data included routine haematology and median pain days between each period.
  Missing pain day values were replaced using multiple imputation. RESULTS: Ten adults
  (three female, median age 30.2 years, range 18-51.5 years) and eleven children (five
  female, median age 12 years, range 8.7-16.9 years) enrolled. Nine adults and seven
  children completed interviews. Qualitative data revealed that the APAP machine was
  smaller, easier to handle, and less noisy. Of 16 participants, 10 preferred APAP
  (62.5%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 38.6-81.5%). Haemoglobin decreased from baseline
  on APAP and NOT (mean difference -3.2 g/L (95% CI -6.0 to -0.2 g/L) and -2.5 g/L
  (95% CI -4.6 to 0.3 g/L), respectively), but there was no significant difference
  between interventions (NOT versus APAP, 1.1 (-1.2 to 3.6)). Pulmonary function changed
  little. Compared with baseline, there were significant decreases in the median number
  of pain days (1.58 for APAP and 1.71 for NOT) but no significant difference comparing
  washout with baseline. After adjustment for carry-over and period effects, there
  was a non-significant median difference of 0.143 (95% CI -0.116 to 0.401) days additional
  pain with APAP compared with NOT. CONCLUSION: In view of the point estimate of patient
  preference for APAP, and no difference in haematology or pulmonary function or evidence
  that pain was worse during or in washout after APAP, it was decided to proceed with
  a Phase II trial of 6 months APAP versus standard care with further safety monitoring
  for bone marrow suppression and pain. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN46078697 . Registered
  on 18 July 2014.'
