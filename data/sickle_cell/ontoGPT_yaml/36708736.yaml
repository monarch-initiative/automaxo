input_text: "Expecting more: the case for incorporating fertility services into comprehensive
  sickle cell disease care. Assisted reproductive technologies (ART) are not yet systematically
  available to people with sickle cell disease or their parents. Fertility care for
  these groups requires addressing sickle cell disease-associated infertility risks,
  fertility preservation options, pregnancy possibilities and outcomes, and, when
  needed, infertility treatment. People with a chance of having a child with sickle
  cell disease can use in-vitro fertilisation with preimplantation genetic testing
  to conceive a child unaffected by sickle cell disease. Also, parents of children
  with sickle cell disease can use this technology to identify embryos to become potential
  future matched sibling donors for stem cell transplant. In the USA, disparities
  in fertility care for the sickle cell disease community are especially stark. Universal
  screening of newborn babies' identifies sickle cell disease and sickle cell trait,
  guidelines direct preconception genetic carrier screening, and standard-of-care
  fertility preserving options exist. However, potentially transformative treatments
  and cures for patients with sickle cell disease are not used due to iatrogenic infertility
  concerns. In diversely resourced care settings, obstacles to providing fertility
  care to people affected by sickle cell disease persist. In this Viewpoint, we contend
  that fertility care should be incorporated into the comprehensive care model for
  sickle cell disease, supporting alignment of treatment goals with reproductive life
  plans and delivering on the promise of individualised high-quality care for people
  with sickle cell disease and their families. We consider the obligation to provide
  fertility care in light of medical evidence, with acknowledgment of formidable obstacles
  to optimising care, and powerful historical and ethical considerations."
