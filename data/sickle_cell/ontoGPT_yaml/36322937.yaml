input_text: 'Hydroxyurea for secondary stroke prevention in children with sickle cell
  anemia in Nigeria: a randomized controlled trial.We tested the hypothesis that fixed
  oral moderate-dose hydroxyurea (20 mg/kg per day) for initial treatment of secondary
  stroke prevention results in an 80% relative risk reduction of stroke or death when
  compared with fixed oral low-dose hydroxyurea (10 mg/kg per day) in a phase 3 double-blind,
  parallel-group, randomized controlled trial in children with sickle cell anemia
  (SCA) living in Nigeria. A total of 101 participants were randomly allocated to
  low-dose (n = 49) and moderate-dose (n = 52) hydroxyurea treatment groups. The median
  participant follow-up was 1.6 years (interquartile range, 1.0-2.3), with a planned
  minimum follow-up of 3.0 years. A total of 6 recurrent strokes and 2 deaths vs 5
  recurrent strokes and 3 deaths occurred in the low- and moderate-dose groups, respectively.
  The incidence rate ratio (IRR) of the primary outcome measure of stroke or death
  in the low- and moderate-dose hydroxyurea treatment groups was 0.98 (95% confidence
  interval [CI], 0.32-3.00; P = .97). The trial was stopped early owing to no clinical
  difference in the incidence rates of the primary outcome measure. The incidence
  rates of recurrent strokes were 7.1 and 6.0 per 100 person-years in the low- and
  moderate-dose groups, respectively, (IRR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.30-4.88; P = .74). As
  a measure of adherence to the oral hydroxyurea therapy, the median percent of returned
  pills was 3.0% and 2.6% in the low- and moderate-dose groups, respectively. No participant
  had hydroxyurea therapy stopped for myelosuppression. For children with SCA in low-income
  settings without access to regular blood transfusion therapy, initial low-dose hydroxyurea
  is a minimum known efficacious dose for secondary stroke prevention.'
