input_text: 'Hydroxyurea for secondary stroke prevention in children with sickle cell
  anemia in Nigeria: a randomized controlled trial. We tested the hypothesis that
  fixed oral moderate-dose hydroxyurea (20 mg/kg per day) for initial treatment of
  secondary stroke prevention results in an 80% relative risk reduction of stroke
  or death when compared with fixed oral low-dose hydroxyurea (10 mg/kg per day) in
  a phase 3 double-blind, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial in children
  with sickle cell anemia (SCA) living in Nigeria. A total of 101 participants were
  randomly allocated to low-dose (n = 49) and moderate-dose (n = 52) hydroxyurea treatment
  groups. The median participant follow-up was 1.6 years (interquartile range, 1.0-2.3),
  with a planned minimum follow-up of 3.0 years. A total of 6 recurrent strokes and
  2 deaths vs 5 recurrent strokes and 3 deaths occurred in the low- and moderate-dose
  groups, respectively. The incidence rate ratio (IRR) of the primary outcome measure
  of stroke or death in the low- and moderate-dose hydroxyurea treatment groups was
  0.98 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.32-3.00; P = .97). The trial was stopped early
  owing to no clinical difference in the incidence rates of the primary outcome measure.
  The incidence rates of recurrent strokes were 7.1 and 6.0 per 100 person-years in
  the low- and moderate-dose groups, respectively, (IRR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.30-4.88;
  P = .74). As a measure of adherence to the oral hydroxyurea therapy, the median
  percent of returned pills was 3.0% and 2.6% in the low- and moderate-dose groups,
  respectively. No participant had hydroxyurea therapy stopped for myelosuppression.
  For children with SCA in low-income settings without access to regular blood transfusion
  therapy, initial low-dose hydroxyurea is a minimum known efficacious dose for secondary
  stroke prevention.'
