input_text: Early Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cells (eMDSCs) Are Associated With High
  Donor Myeloid Chimerism Following Haploidentical HSCT for Sickle Cell Disease.Haploidentical
  hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (haplo-HSCT) is a widely available curative
  option for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Our original non-myeloablative
  haplo-HSCT trial employing post-transplant (PT) cyclophosphamide had a low incidence
  of GVHD but had high rejection rates. Here, we aimed to evaluate immune reconstitution
  following haplo-HSCT and identify cytokines and cells associated with graft rejection/engraftment.
  50 cytokines and 10 immune cell subsets were screened using multiplex-ELISA and
  flow cytometry, respectively, at baseline and PT-Days 30, 60, 100, and 180. We observed
  the most significant differences in cytokine levels between the engrafted and rejected
  groups at PT-Day 60, corresponding with clinical findings of secondary graft rejection.
  Of the 44 cytokines evaluated, plasma concentrations of 19 cytokines were different
  between the two groups at PT-Day 60. Factor analysis suggested two independent factors.
  The first factor (IL-17A, IL-10, IL-7, G-CSF, IL-2, MIP-1a, VEGF, and TGFb1 contributed
  significantly) was strongly associated with engraftment with OR = 2.7 (95%CI of
  1.4 to 5.4), whereas the second factor (GROa and IL-18 contributed significantly)
  was not significantly associated with engraftment. Sufficient donor myeloid chimerism
  (DMC) is critical for the success of HSCT; here, we evaluated immune cells among
  high (H) DMC (DMC>=20%) and low (L) DMC (DMC<20%) groups along with engrafted and
  rejected groups. We found that early myeloid-derived suppressor cell (eMDSC) frequencies
  were elevated in engrafted patients and patients with HDMC at PT-Day 30 (P< 0.04
  & P< 0.003, respectively). 9 of 20 patients were evaluated for the source of eMDSCs.
  The HDMC group had high mixed chimeric eMDSCs as compared to the LDMC group (P<
  0.00001). We found a positive correlation between the frequencies of eMDSCs and
  Tregs at PT-Day 100 (r=0.72, P <0.0007); eMDSCs at BSL and Tregs at PT-Day 100 (r=0.63,
  P <0.004). Of 10 immune regulatory cells and 50 cytokines, we observed mixed chimeric
  eMDSCs and IL-17A, IL-10, IL-7, G-CSF, IL-2, MIP-1a, VEGF, TGFb1 as potential hits
  which could serve as prognostic markers in predicting allograft outcome towards
  engraftment following haploidentical HSCT employing post-transplant cyclophosphamide.
  The current findings need to be replicated and further explored in a larger cohort.
