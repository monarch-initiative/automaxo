input_text: 'Emergency department visits and hospitalizations for pediatric vaso-occlusive
  pain events during the COVID-19 pandemic. The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19)
  pandemic altered all aspects of life, including healthcare. During the pandemic,
  social distancing led to decreased transmission of typical viral illnesses, leading
  to a decrease in these pediatric admissions. Studies have shown that pediatric emergency
  department (ED) visits and hospitalizations decreased during the pandemic, which
  may have led to some unmet healthcare needs and delays in treatment. Little is known
  about the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on ED visits and hospitalizations specifically
  for pediatric sickle cell pain. A retrospective review across hospitals in the Northwell
  Health system was conducted to compare the ED visits and hospitalizations for pediatric
  patients with sickle cell pain during 2020 (the year of the pandemic), the following
  year (2021), and the 2 years prior to the pandemic (2018, 2019). The average length
  of stay for patients hospitalized with vaso-occlusive events was also compared between
  these years. Total 511 patient encounters for patients seen and discharged home
  from the ED and 985 hospitalization encounters were included over the 4-year timespan.
  ED visits per year decreased significantly in 2020 compared with the 2 years prior
  (p < .001): 91 visits in 2020, 162 visits in 2019, and 143 visits in 2018. The number
  of ED visits for pediatric vaso-occlusive events trended upward in 2021 to 115.
  Hospitalizations also decreased in 2020 compared to the 2 years prior (n = 202 vs
  196; p < .001), compared with 298 in 2019 and 289 in 2018. The number of patients
  hospitalized remained stable in 2021 (n = 202 vs 196). There was a statistically
  significant increase in the median length of stay in 2020 compared to years prior
  (p = .002): median (interquartile range [IQR]): 4.0 days (2-6 days) in 2020 compared
  to 3.0 days (2-5 days) in 2018 and 2019. ED encounters and hospitalizations for
  pediatric patients with sickle cell disease pain decreased during the pandemic;
  however, admitted patients had a longer median length of stay.'
