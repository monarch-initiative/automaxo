input_text: "An innovative intervention for the prevention of vaso-occlusive episodes
  in sickle cell disease. OBJECTIVES: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is characterized by
  a mutation in the beta-globin gene resulting in abnormal hemoglobin S (HgbS). The
  significant sequela of SCD include anemia and recurrent vaso-occlusive episodes
  (VOEs) which may effectuate patients to receive chronic blood transfusions. Current
  pharmacotherapy options for SCD include hydroxyurea, voxelotor, Lglutamine, and
  crizanlizumab. Simple and exchange transfusions are often utilized as prophylaxis
  to prevent emergency department (ED)/urgent care (UC) visits or hospitalizations
  from VOEs by reducing the level of sickled red blood cells (RBCs). In addition,
  the treatment of VOEs involves intravenous (IV) hydration and pain management. Studies
  have demonstrated that sickle cell infusion centers (SCIC) decrease hospital admissions
  for VOEs, and IV hydration and pain medications are the key components of management
  employed. Thus, we hypothesized that implementing a structured infusion protocol
  in the outpatient setting would reduce the incidence of VOEs. METHODS: Here, we
  discuss two patients with SCD who were trialed on scheduled outpatient IV hydration
  and opioids with the goal of decreasing the frequency of VOEs in the setting of
  the current blood product shortage and the patients' refusal to receive exchange
  transfusions. RESULTS: Overall, the two patients had opposing outcomes- one demonstrated
  reduced frequency of VOEs, whereas the other had mixed results due to noncompliance
  to scheduled outpatient sessions. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: The use of outpatient SCICs
  may be an effective intervention for prevention of VOEs in patients with SCD, and
  further patient-centered research and quality improvement initiatives are needed
  to further quantify and understand the factors contributing to their efficacy."
