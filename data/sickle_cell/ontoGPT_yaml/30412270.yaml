input_text: "Multiple hemolytic transfusion reactions misinterpreted as severe vaso-occlusive
  crisis in a patient with sickle cell disease. BACKGROUND: Hemolytic transfusion
  reactions are a rare, yet serious complication of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion.
  Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) are at an increased risk for such reactions,
  because they are prone to make alloantibodies against transfused RBCs, complicating
  this integral part of their disease management. These reactions may be missed, and
  the patient's state may be attributed to vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC), with misguided
  therapy ensuing. CASE REPORT: Herein, we report the clinical course of a patient
  with complex SCD with a delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction, followed by multiple
  acute hemolytic transfusion reactions mistaken for severe VOC. These reactions were
  diagnosed on retrospective review of the patient's clinical course in consult with
  the transfusion medicine service. Optimal immunosuppressive therapy ensued and resulted
  in the stabilization of the anemia and hemolysis laboratory values. Despite these
  efforts, the patient died 2 months after admission. CONCLUSION: This case provides
  insight into some of the challenges of managing patients with SCD with multiple
  comorbidities. Hemolytic transfusion reactions can be difficult to diagnose and
  may be overlooked in patients with SCD with severe VOC."
