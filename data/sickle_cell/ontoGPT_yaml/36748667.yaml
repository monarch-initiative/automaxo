input_text: 'Successful therapeutic plasma exchange for a patient with sickle cell
  disease and fat embolism syndrome after a failure of a response to red cell exchange
  transfusion. BACKGROUND: Fat embolism syndrome (FES) is a rare complication, which
  was reported mostly with milder forms of heterozygous sickle cell disease (SCD).
  It may present in a catastrophic way with multi-organ failure, particularly involving
  the pulmonary and neurological systems. Diagnosis is often missed or delayed; and
  the standard recommended treatment is red cell exchange (RCE) transfusion, which
  has sub-optimal results, such as debilitating long-term neurological complications.
  Recently, few reports suggested that the addition of Therapeutic Plasma Exchange
  (TPE) might further improve the outcome. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 23-year-old woman with
  homozygote SCD was admitted with bony pains and vaso-occlusive crises. However,
  her course evolved to respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, decreased
  level of consciousness, skin rash, severe anemia and thrombocytopenia and a picture
  consistent with thrombotic microangiopathy. MRI of the brain showed scattered multi-focal
  ischemic foci and cytotoxic edema. The patient received RCE on the third day after
  admission without improvement. On the seventh day, TPE was instituted (2 L/day of
  fresh frozen plasma for 5 days), following which she regained her consciousness
  and showed an improvement in her laboratory abnormalities. On follow up, she had
  gradual full neurological recovery and resolution of the MRI findings within a few
  months. CONCLUSION: FES remains a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge, with significant
  morbidity and mortality. Success in the management of this reported case with the
  addition of TPE to RCE supports the notion that TPE may be a potentially helpful
  modality that deserves further research.'
