input_text: 'Fluid overload due to intravenous fluid therapy for vaso-occlusive crisis
  in sickle cell disease: incidence and risk factors. Intravenous fluid therapy (IV-FT)
  is routinely used in the treatment of vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs), as dehydration
  possibly promotes and sustains erythrocyte sickling. Patients with sickle cell disease
  (SCD) are at risk of developing diastolic dysfunction and fluid overload due to
  IV-FT. However, data on the adverse effects of IV-FT for VOC is sparse. We aimed
  to evaluate the incidence and risk factors of fluid overload due to IV-FT in patients
  with SCD. Consecutive hospitalisations for VOC treated with IV-FT between September
  2016 and September 2018 were retrospectively analysed. The median (interquartile
  range) age was 25 0 (18 3-33 8) years and 65% had a severe genotype (HbSS/HbSbeta0
  -thal). Fluid overload occurred in 21% of 100 patients. Hospital stay was longer
  in patients with fluid overload (6 0 vs. 4 0 days, P = 0 037). A positive history
  of fluid overload (P = 0 017), lactate dehydrogenase level (P = 0 011), and top-up
  transfusion during admission (P = 0 005) were independently associated with fluid
  overload occurrence. IV-FT was not reduced in 86% of patients despite a previous
  history of fluid overload. Fluid overload is frequently encountered during IV-FT
  for VOC. IV-FT is often not adjusted despite a positive history of fluid overload
  or when top-up transfusion is indicated, emphasising the need for more awareness
  of this complication and a personalised approach.'
