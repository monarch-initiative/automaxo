input_text: "Rates of Opioid Misuse Amongst Patients Receiving Pain Management for
  Sickle Cell Disease in An Urban Setting. Background and Objective: Sickle Cell Disease
  (SCD) is known to cause acute severe pain episodes known as vaso-occlusive crisis
  (VOC) mainly treated with opioid analgesics. Since the opioid epidemic there is
  an interest in determining the opioid misuse potential in these patients. Therefore,
  the primary objective of this study is to determine the rates of opioid misuse among
  patients with SCD by assessing the rate of unexpected drug screening results in
  a sickle cell disease clinic. Methods: This was a retrospective chart review study
  conducted at the outpatient sickle cell disease clinic. The primary independent
  variables were the prescribed opioid medications while the primary dependent variable
  was the collected opioid metabolite. Descriptive statistics, linear regression and
  multivariate logistic regression analysis were conducted using SPSS version 24.
  Results: A total of 100 participants were recruited from July 1, 2018, to June 30,
  2020 with 71 included in the analysis. The total mean of morphine milligram equivalents
  (MME) for all participants was 71.1+-104.9 with 71% of participants having a daily
  calculated MME of <90MME. The odds of misusing an opioid were 6.72 times higher
  (P<.02) if a participant used marijuana compared to a participant who didn't. In
  addition, the odds of misusing an opioid were 2.47 times higher (P<.04) if the patient
  was prescribed an opioid daily dose greater than 90 MME as opposed to a daily dose
  less than 90 MME. Conclusion: Participants who consumed greater than 90 MME's per
  day and utilized marijuana were more likely to misuse opioids."
