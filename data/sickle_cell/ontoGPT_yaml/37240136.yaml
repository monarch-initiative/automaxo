input_text: Are Genetic Modifiers the Answer to Different Responses to Hydroxyurea
  Treatment?-A Pharmacogenetic Study in Sickle Cell Anemia Angolan Children.Sickle
  cell anemia (SCA) is an inherited disease affecting the hemoglobin that is particularly
  common in sub-Saharan Africa. Although monogenic, phenotypes are markedly heterogeneous
  in terms of severity and life span. Hydroxyurea is still the most common treatment
  for these patients, and the response to treatment is highly variable and seems to
  be an inherited trait. Therefore, identifying the variants that might predict hydroxyurea
  response is important for identifying patients who will have a poorer or non-response
  to treatment, and the ones that are more prone to suffer from severe side effects.
  In the present pharmacogenetic study, we analyzed the exons of 77 genes described
  in the literature as potentially associated with hydroxyurea metabolism in Angolan
  children treated with hydroxyurea and evaluated the drug response considering fetal
  hemoglobin levels, other hematological and biochemical parameters, hemolysis, number
  of vaso-occlusive crises and hospitalizations. Thirty variants were identified in
  18 of those genes as possibly associated with drug response, five of them in gene
  DCHS2. Other polymorphisms in this gene were also associated with hematological,
  biochemical and clinical parameters. Further research examining the maximum tolerated
  dose and fixed dose with a larger sample size is necessary to corroborate these
  findings.
