input_text: "Interventions for preventing silent cerebral infarcts in people with
  sickle cell disease. BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the commonest
  severe monogenic disorders in the world, due to the inheritance of two abnormal
  haemoglobin (beta globin) genes. SCD can cause severe pain, significant end-organ
  damage, pulmonary complications, and premature death. Silent cerebral infarcts are
  the commonest neurological complication in children and probably adults with SCD.
  Silent cerebral infarcts also affect academic performance, increase cognitive deficits
  and may lower intelligence quotient. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of
  interventions to reduce or prevent silent cerebral infarcts in people with SCD.
  SEARCH METHODS: We searched for relevant trials in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE
  (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the Transfusion Evidence Library (from 1980), and
  ongoing trial databases; all searches current to 19 September 2016. We searched
  the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register: 06 October
  2016. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials comparing interventions to
  prevent silent cerebral infarcts in people with SCD. There were no restrictions
  by outcomes examined, language or publication status. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS:
  We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. MAIN RESULTS: We included five
  trials (660 children or adolescents) published between 1998 and 2016. Four of the
  five trials were terminated early. The vast majority of participants had the haemoglobin
  (Hb)SS form of SCD. One trial focused on preventing silent cerebral infarcts or
  stroke; three trials were for primary stroke prevention and one trial dealt with
  secondary stroke prevention.Three trials compared the use of regular long-term red
  blood cell transfusions to standard care. Two of these trials included children
  with no previous long-term transfusions: one in children with normal transcranial
  doppler (TCD) velocities; and one in children with abnormal TCD velocities. The
  third trial included children and adolescents on long-term transfusion.Two trials
  compared the drug hydroxyurea and phlebotomy to long-term transfusions and iron
  chelation therapy: one in primary prevention (children), and one in secondary prevention
  (children and adolescents).The quality of the evidence was moderate to very low
  across different outcomes according to GRADE methodology. This was due to trials
  being at high risk of bias because they were unblinded; indirectness (available
  evidence was only for children with HbSS); and imprecise outcome estimates. Long-term
  red blood cell transfusions versus standard care Children with no previous long-term
  transfusions and higher risk of stroke (abnormal TCD velocities or previous history
  of silent cerebral infarcts) Long-term red blood cell transfusions may reduce the
  incidence of silent cerebral infarcts in children with abnormal TCD velocities,
  risk ratio (RR) 0.11 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 to 0.86) (one trial, 124
  participants, low-quality evidence); but make little or no difference to the incidence
  of silent cerebral infarcts in children with previous silent cerebral infarcts on
  magnetic resonance imaging and normal or conditional TCDs, RR 0.70 (95% CI 0.23
  to 2.13) (one trial, 196 participants, low-quality evidence).No deaths were reported
  in either trial.Long-term red blood cell transfusions may reduce the incidence of:
  acute chest syndrome, RR 0.24 (95% CI 0.12 to 0.49) (two trials, 326 participants,
  low-quality evidence); and painful crisis, RR 0.63 (95% CI 0.42 to 0.95) (two trials,
  326 participants, low-quality evidence); and probably reduces the incidence of clinical
  stroke, RR 0.12 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.49) (two trials, 326 participants, moderate-quality
  evidence).Long-term red blood cell transfusions may improve quality of life in children
  with previous silent cerebral infarcts (difference estimate -0.54; 95% confidence
  interval -0.92 to -0.17; one trial; 166 participants), but may have no effect on
  cognitive function (least squares means: 1.7, 95% CI -1.1 to 4.4) (one trial, 166
  participants, low-quality evidence). Transfusions continued versus transfusions
  halted: children and adolescents with normalised TCD velocities (79 participants;
  one trial)Continuing red blood cell transfusions may reduce the incidence of silent
  cerebral infarcts, RR 0.29 (95% CI 0.09 to 0.97 (low-quality evidence).We are very
  uncertain whether continuing red blood cell transfusions has any effect on all-cause
  mortality, Peto odds ratio (OR) 8.00 (95% CI 0.16 to 404.12); or clinical stroke,
  RR 0.22 (95% CI 0.01 to 4.35) (very low-quality evidence).The trial did not report:
  comparative numbers for SCD-related adverse events; quality of life; or cognitive
  function. Hydroxyurea and phlebotomy versus transfusions and chelation Primary prevention,
  children (121 participants; one trial)We are very uncertain whether switching to
  hydroxyurea and phlebotomy has any effect on: silent cerebral infarcts (no infarcts);
  all-cause mortality (no deaths); risk of stroke (no strokes); or SCD-related complications,
  RR 1.52 (95% CI 0.58 to 4.02) (very low-quality evidence). Secondary prevention,
  children and adolescents with a history of stroke (133 participants; one trial)We
  are very uncertain whether switching to hydroxyurea and phlebotomy has any effect
  on: silent cerebral infarcts, Peto OR 7.28 (95% CI 0.14 to 366.91); all-cause mortality,
  Peto OR 1.02 (95%CI 0.06 to 16.41); or clinical stroke, RR 14.78 (95% CI 0.86 to
  253.66) (very low-quality evidence).Switching to hydroxyurea and phlebotomy may
  increase the risk of SCD-related complications, RR 3.10 (95% CI 1.42 to 6.75) (low-quality
  evidence).Neither trial reported on quality of life or cognitive function. AUTHORS'
  CONCLUSIONS: We identified no trials for preventing silent cerebral infarcts in
  adults, or in children who do not have HbSS SCD.Long-term red blood cell transfusions
  may reduce the incidence of silent cerebral infarcts in children with abnormal TCD
  velocities, but may have little or no effect on children with normal TCD velocities.
  In children who are at higher risk of stroke and have not had previous long-term
  transfusions, long-term red blood cell transfusions probably reduce the risk of
  stroke, and other SCD-related complications (acute chest syndrome and painful crises).In
  children and adolescents at high risk of stroke whose TCD velocities have normalised,
  continuing red blood cell transfusions may reduce the risk of silent cerebral infarcts.
  No treatment duration threshold has been established for stopping transfusions.Switching
  to hydroxyurea with phlebotomy may increase the risk of silent cerebral infarcts
  and SCD-related serious adverse events in secondary stroke prevention.All other
  evidence in this review is of very low-quality."
