input_text: 'Disparities in pediatric hospital use during transition to adult healthcare
  for young adults with childhood-onset chronic conditions. BACKGROUND: Young adults
  (YA) with childhood-onset chronic conditions-particularly YA with cystic fibrosis
  (CF), congenital heart disease (CHD), and sickle cell disease (SCD)-continue to
  have pediatric hospital admissions. Factors associated with this continued pediatric
  hospital use remain underexplored. OBJECTIVE: To determine if pediatric hospital
  use by YA differed (1) across condition and (2) within each condition by sociodemographic
  factors. METHODS: Conducted a cross-sectional analysis of admissions for YA 22-35
  years with CF, CHD, and SCD from 2016 to 2020 in the National Inpatient Sample.
  Admissions for YA with CF, CHD, and SCD were identified by international classification
  of diseases, 10th revision-clinical modification diagnosis codes. To determine if
  conditions or sociodemographic factors were associated with YA pediatric hospital
  use, we used multivariable logistic regression with separate models for the different
  objectives. RESULTS: YA with SCD had lower odds of pediatric hospital use compared
  to YA with CF. Relationships between sociodemographic factors and pediatric hospital
  use varied. Black YA with both CF and CHD had lower odds of pediatric hospital use
  than white YA with CF and CHD. For YA with SCD, despite 17,810 (6.5%) having rural
  residence, zero (0) had pediatric hospital use; whereas YA with CF living in a rural
  area had greater odds of pediatric hospital use compared to urban residents. CONCLUSION:
  YA with SCD used pediatric hospitals less than YA with either CF or CHD. Coupled
  with our findings that Black YA with CF and CHD had less pediatric hospital use,
  these data may reflect systematic racial differences within pediatric to adult healthcare
  transition programs.'
