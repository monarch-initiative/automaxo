input_text: 'CRISPR-Cas System: The Current and Emerging Translational Landscape.
  CRISPR-Cas technology has rapidly changed life science research and human medicine.
  The ability to add, remove, or edit human DNA sequences has transformative potential
  for treating congenital and acquired human diseases. The timely maturation of the
  cell and gene therapy ecosystem and its seamless integration with CRISPR-Cas technologies
  has enabled the development of therapies that could potentially cure not only monogenic
  diseases such as sickle cell anemia and muscular dystrophy, but also complex heterogenous
  diseases such as cancer and diabetes. Here, we review the current landscape of clinical
  trials involving the use of various CRISPR-Cas systems as therapeutics for human
  diseases, discuss challenges, and explore new CRISPR-Cas-based tools such as base
  editing, prime editing, CRISPR-based transcriptional regulation, CRISPR-based epigenome
  editing, and RNA editing, each promising new functionality and broadening therapeutic
  potential. Finally, we discuss how the CRISPR-Cas system is being used to understand
  the biology of human diseases through the generation of large animal disease models
  used for preclinical testing of emerging therapeutics.'
