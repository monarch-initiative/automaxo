input_text: "Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell Technology: A Paradigm Shift in Medical
  Science for Drug Screening and Disease Modeling. BACKGROUND: Induced Pluripotent
  Stem Cell (IPSC) Technology is the most advanced research as it offers an attractive
  alternative for establishing patient-specific IPSCs to recapitulate phenotypes of
  not only monogenic diseases (viz. Thalassaemia, Sickle cell anemia, Haemophilia,
  Tay-Sachs disease), but also late-onset polygenic diseases (viz. Parkinson's disease,
  Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia). Over the hindsight, numerous studies of the
  past and current scientists have led to the production, maturation and understanding
  of induced pluripotent stem cell technology and its use in basic and clinical research.
  METHODS: A systematic search of peer-reviewed scientific literature and clinical
  trials in public databases were carried out to summarize the evidence on the use
  of IPSC. RESULTS: Current review sheds light upon the use of patient-derived iPSC
  models in drug toxicity, screening and discovery which have been derived after referring
  to more than 200 articles in literature. Furthermore, their use as disease models
  was also studied signifying the versatility of iPSC lines. CONCLUSION: Through this
  review, we describe the advent of iPSC technology, where we comprehensively cover
  the generation of iPSCs and their characterization along with their prospective
  applications using IPSC banks in disease modeling and drug screening."
