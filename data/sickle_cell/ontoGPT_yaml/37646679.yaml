input_text: 'CRISPR-Cas9 Editing of the HBG1 and HBG2 Promoters to Treat Sickle Cell
  Disease.BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease is caused by a defect in the beta-globin
  subunit of adult hemoglobin. Sickle hemoglobin polymerizes under hypoxic conditions,
  producing deformed red cells that hemolyze and cause vaso-occlusion that results
  in progressive organ damage and early death. Elevated fetal hemoglobin levels in
  red cells protect against complications of sickle cell disease. OTQ923, a clustered
  regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9-edited CD34+ hematopoietic
  stem- and progenitor-cell (HSPC) product, has a targeted disruption of the HBG1
  and HBG2 (gamma-globin) gene promoters that increases fetal hemoglobin expression
  in red-cell progeny. METHODS: We performed a tiling CRISPR-Cas9 screen of the HBG1
  and HBG2 promoters by electroporating CD34+ cells obtained from healthy donors with
  Cas9 complexed with one of 72 guide RNAs, and we assessed the fraction of fetal
  hemoglobin-immunostaining erythroblasts (F cells) in erythroid-differentiated progeny.
  The gRNA resulting in the highest level of F cells (gRNA-68) was selected for clinical
  development. We enrolled participants with severe sickle cell disease in a multicenter,
  phase 1-2 clinical study to assess the safety and adverse-effect profile of OTQ923.
  RESULTS: In preclinical experiments, CD34+ HSPCs (obtained from healthy donors and
  persons with sickle cell disease) edited with CRISPR-Cas9 and gRNA-68 had sustained
  on-target editing with no off-target mutations and produced high levels of fetal
  hemoglobin after in vitro differentiation or xenotransplantation into immunodeficient
  mice. In the study, three participants received autologous OTQ923 after myeloablative
  conditioning and were followed for 6 to 18 months. At the end of the follow-up period,
  all the participants had engraftment and stable induction of fetal hemoglobin (fetal
  hemoglobin as a percentage of total hemoglobin, 19.0 to 26.8%), with fetal hemoglobin
  broadly distributed in red cells (F cells as a percentage of red cells, 69.7 to
  87.8%). Manifestations of sickle cell disease decreased during the follow-up period.
  CONCLUSIONS: CRISPR-Cas9 disruption of the HBG1 and HBG2 gene promoters was an effective
  strategy for induction of fetal hemoglobin. Infusion of autologous OTQ923 into three
  participants with severe sickle cell disease resulted in sustained induction of
  red-cell fetal hemoglobin and clinical improvement in disease severity. (Funded
