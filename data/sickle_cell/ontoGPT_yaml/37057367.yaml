input_text: 'Desire for biological parenthood and patient counseling on the risk of
  infertility among adolescents and adults with hemoglobinopathies. BACKGROUND: Both
  diagnosis and treatment of hemoglobinopathies have been associated with an increased
  risk of fertility impairment. German guidelines recommend annual monitoring of fertility
  parameters to enable early detection of fertility impairment and/or to offer fertility
  preservation (FP) when indicated. We explored the general desire for parenthood,
  the frequency of recalling fertility counseling and testing, and the utilization
  of FP in adolescents and adults with hemoglobinopathies. PROCEDURE: In a cross-sectional
  study, patients aged 12-50 years, treated in Germany, Austria, or Switzerland, were
  surveyed on fertility-related aspects. Medical data, including fertility testing
  results, were collected from patient records. RESULTS: Overall, 116/121 eligible
  patients, diagnosed with sickle cell disease (70.7%), thalassemia (27.6%), or other
  hemoglobinopathy (1.7%), participated in our study (57.8% female, median age 17.0
  years, range 12-50 years). All participants required treatment of the underlying
  hemoglobinopathy: 68.1% received hydroxyurea, 25.9% required regular blood transfusions,
  and 6.0% underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Most patients
  (82/108, 75.9%) stated a considerable to strong desire for (future) parenthood,
  independent of sex, education, diagnosis, or subjective health status. Fertility
  counseling was only recalled by 32/111 patients (28.8%) and least frequently by
  younger patients (12-16 years) or those treated with regular blood transfusions
  or hydroxyurea. While fertility testing was documented for 59.5% (69/116) in medical
  records, only 11.6% (13/112) recalled previous assessments. FP was only used by
  5.4% (6/111) of patients. CONCLUSION: Most patients with hemoglobinopathies wish
  to have biological children, yet only few recalled fertility counseling and testing.
  Adequate patient counseling should be offered to all patients at risk for infertility.'
