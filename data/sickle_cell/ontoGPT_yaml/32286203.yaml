input_text: 'Leg Ulcers in Sickle-Cell Disease: Treatment Update. Significance: Sickle-cell
  leg ulcers (SCLUs) are a severe, chronic, and recurrent complication of sickle-cell
  disease (SCD). There are no official recommendations for treatment. Recent Advances:
  Only a few studies with a high level of evidence have been conducted to evaluate
  treatment of SCLUs. However, several studies have been conducted with a high level
  of evidence to evaluate the efficacy of treatments in venous leg ulcers, and SCLUs
  could benefit from these treatments, especially when a venous incompetence or an
  edema is associated. Pathophysiology of SCLUs includes a vasculopathy related to
  chronic hemolysis and an endothelial dysfunction, which could be therapeutic approaches
  to SCLU treatment. Critical Issues: Therapeutic approaches to SCLUs can target SCD
  on the one hand and skin healing and associated aggravating factors on the other.
  A review of the literature found only case series and six randomized controlled
  trials; some offered encouraging results, but most had serious biases. Clinical
  trials specifically targeting SCLUs are difficult to realize because of the small
  number of affected patients, in comparison with patients with leg ulcers from other
  causes. Future Direction: Treating SCLUs remains a challenge. Data in the literature
  are currently insufficient to offer clear treatment guidelines because of several
  biases in controlled studies. New studies are under way to assess the efficacy of
  topical treatments and describe the microbiome of SCLUs. Prevention of SCLU recurrence
  should be assessed in future clinical trials because the high risk of recurrence
  is an unsolved critical issue.'
