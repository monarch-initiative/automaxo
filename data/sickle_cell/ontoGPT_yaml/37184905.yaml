input_text: "Developing an Implementation Blueprint for the NIH HEAL Initiative GRACE
  Trial: Perspectives on Acupuncture and Guided Relaxation for Chronic Sickle Cell
  Disease Pain.Objective: This study aimed to explore perspectives of people living
  with sickle cell disease (SCD) and SCD clinic providers and staff about the use
  of acupuncture and guided relaxation for treating chronic SCD pain. Data obtained
  were to inform an implementation blueprint for an effectiveness implementation clinical
  trial (GRACE Trial) testing whether acupuncture or guided relaxation reduces chronic
  pain when compared with usual care. Design: Qualitative research design. Methods:
  We conducted 33 semistructured interviews with people with SCD and SCD clinic providers
  and staff. Interviews were transcribed and coded. A deductive content analysis process
  was used to identify themes. Results: Four themes were identified: Receptivity to
  Acupuncture and Guided Relaxation, Limited Awareness, Complementary and Integrative
  Health (CIH) Therapy Preference, and Access Barriers. Both patients and clinic providers
  and staff were open to the use of acupuncture and guided relaxation for chronic
  pain treatment. After learning about these CIH therapies, some patients expressed
  a preference for one therapy over the other. They also discussed their ability to
  successfully engage with each therapy. There is a need to dispel misconceptions
  about the therapies by increasing understanding of how each therapy is implemented
  and functions to reduce pain. We identified several potential barriers that might
  affect the success of the trial and future health system integration, including
  time, transportation, and technology. Conclusion: This study is one of the first
  to present perspectives of both patients with SCD and clinic providers and staff
  on the use of acupuncture and guided relaxation for chronic SCD pain. Stakeholders'
  early input and perspectives highlighted that they welcome nonpharmacological CIH
  therapies. Implementation of a clinical trial and future health system integration
  will require the addressing misinformation and identifying strategies to overcome
  access barriers. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04906447."
