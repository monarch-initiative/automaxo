input_text: "MRI detection of brain abnormality in sickle cell disease.Introduction:
  Over the past decades, neuroimaging studies have clarified that a significant proportion
  of patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) have functionally significant brain abnormalities.
  Clinically, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences (T2, FLAIR, diffusion-weighted
  imaging) have been used by radiologists to diagnose chronic and acute cerebral infarction
  (both overt and clinically silent), while magnetic resonance angiography and venography
  have been used to diagnose arteriopathy and venous thrombosis. In research settings,
  imaging scientists are increasingly applying quantitative techniques to shine further
  light on underlying mechanisms.Areas covered: From a June 2020 PubMed search of
  'magnetic' or 'MRI' and 'sickle' over the previous 5 years, we selected manuscripts
  on T1-based morphometric analysis, diffusion tensor imaging, arterial spin labeling,
  T2-oximetry, quantitative susceptibility, and connectivity.Expert Opinion: Quantitative
  MRI techniques are identifying structural and hemodynamic biomarkers associated
  with risk of neurological and neurocognitive complications. A growing body of evidence
  suggests that these biomarkers are sensitive to change with treatments, such as
  blood transfusion and hydroxyurea, indicating that they may hold promise as endpoints
  in future randomized clinical trials of novel approaches including hemoglobin F
  upregulation, reduction of polymerization, and gene therapy. With further validation,
  such techniques may eventually also improve neurological and neurocognitive risk
  stratification in this vulnerable population."
