input_text: 'Evaluation of the efficacy and safety of deferiprone compared with deferasirox
  in paediatric patients with transfusion-dependent haemoglobinopathies (DEEP-2):
  a multicentre, randomised, open-label, non-inferiority, phase 3 trial. BACKGROUND:
  Transfusion-dependent haemoglobinopathies require lifelong iron chelation therapy
  with one of the three iron chelators (deferiprone, deferasirox, or deferoxamine).
  Deferasirox and deferiprone are the only two oral chelators used in adult patients
  with transfusion-dependent haemoglobinopathies. To our knowledge, there are no randomised
  clinical trials comparing deferiprone, a less expensive iron chelator, with deferasirox
  in paediatric patients. We aimed to show the non-inferiority of deferiprone versus
  deferasirox. METHODS: DEEP-2 was a phase 3, multicentre, randomised trial in paediatric
  patients (aged 1 month to 18 years) with transfusion-dependent haemoglobinopathies.
  The study was done in 21 research hospitals and universities in Italy, Egypt, Greece,
  Albania, Cyprus, Tunisia, and the UK. Participants were receiving at least 150 mL/kg
  per year of red blood cells for the past 2 years at the time of enrolment, and were
  receiving deferoxamine (<100 mg/kg per day) or deferasirox (<40 mg/kg per day; deferasirox
  is not registered for use in children aged <2 years so only deferoxamine was being
  used in these patients). Any previous chelation treatment was permitted with a 7-day
  washout period. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive orally administered
  daily deferiprone (75-100 mg/kg per day) or daily deferasirox (20-40 mg/kg per day)
  administered as dispersible tablets, both with dose adjustment for 12 months, stratified
  by age (<10 years and >=10 years) and balanced by country. The primary efficacy
  endpoint was based on predefined success criteria for changes in serum ferritin
  concentration (all patients) and cardiac MRI T2-star (T2*; patients aged >10 years)
  to show non-inferiority of deferiprone versus deferasirox in the per-protocol population,
  defined as all randomly assigned patients who received the study drugs and had available
  data for both variables at baseline and after 1 year of treatment, without major
  protocol violations. Non-inferiority was based on the two-sided 95% CI of the difference
  in the proportion of patients with treatment success between the two groups and
  was shown if the lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI was greater than -12 5%. Safety
  was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This
  study is registered with EudraCT, 2012-000353-31, and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01825512.
  FINDINGS: 435 patients were enrolled between March 17, 2014, and June 16, 2016,
  393 of whom were randomly assigned to a treatment group (194 to the deferiprone
  group; 199 to the deferasirox group). 352 (90%) of 390 patients had beta-thalassaemia
  major, 27 (7%) had sickle cell disease, five (1%) had thalassodrepanocytosis, and
  six (2%) had other haemoglobinopathies. Median follow-up was 379 days (IQR 294-392)
  for deferiprone and 381 days (350-392) for deferasirox. Non-inferiority of deferiprone
  versus deferasirox was established (treatment success in 69 [55 2%] of 125 patients
  assigned deferiprone with primary composite efficacy endpoint data available at
  baseline and 1 year vs 80 [54 8%] of 146 assigned deferasirox, difference 0 4%;
  95% CI -11 9 to 12 6). No significant difference between the groups was shown in
  the occurrence of serious and drug-related adverse events. Three (2%) cases of reversible
  agranulocytosis occurred in the 193 patients in the safety analysis in the deferiprone
  group and two (1%) cases of reversible renal and urinary disorders (one case of
  each) occurred in the 197 patients in the deferasirox group. Compliance was similar
  between treatment groups: 183 (95%) of 193 patients in the deferiprone group versus
  192 (97%) of 197 patients in the deferisirox group. INTERPRETATION: In paediatric
  patients with transfusion-dependent haemoglobinopathies, deferiprone was effective
  and safe in inducing control of iron overload during 12 months of treatment. Considering
  the need for availability of more chelation treatments in paediatric populations,
  deferiprone offers a valuable treatment option for this age group. FUNDING: EU Seventh
