input_text: Reduction in the Prevalence of Thrombotic Events in Sickle Cell Disease
  after Allogeneic Hematopoietic Transplantation. Thrombosis is a recognized complication
  in sickle cell disease (SCD). Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT)
  remains the sole curative option for patients with severe SCD phenotypes. Data describing
  the effects of allo-HCT on recurrent thrombotic events (venous and arterial events)
  are limited, however. We evaluated 31 patients with SCD who underwent allo-HCT with
  a median follow-up of 34.5 months (range, 13 to 115) post-transplantation. No patient
  continued anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy after allo-HCT. There was an absolute
  difference of 32% (95% confidence interval [CI], 12.3% to 32.2%; P = .002) in the
  prevalence of venous thromboembolic (VTE) events before and after allo-HSCT. In
  addition, there was an absolute difference of 38.5% (95% CI, 10.63 to 45.96; P =
  .006) in the number of ischemic cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) occurring before
  and after allo-HSCT. Patients with severe SCD who undergo allo-HCT are less likely
  to develop recurrent thrombotic events compared with a control cohort of patients
  matched for age and genotype (odds ratio, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.058 to 0.83; P = .025).
  Following curative therapy with allo-HCT, there is a reduction in recurrent arterial
  and venous thrombosis in patients with severe SCD phenotypes.
