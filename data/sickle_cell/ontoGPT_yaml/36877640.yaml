input_text: "Interventions for improving adherence to iron chelation therapy in people
  with sickle cell disease or thalassaemia. BACKGROUND: Regularly transfused people
  with sickle cell disease (SCD) and people with thalassaemia are at risk of iron
  overload. Iron overload can lead to iron toxicity in vulnerable organs such as the
  heart, liver and endocrine glands, which can be prevented and treated with iron-chelating
  agents. The intensive demands and uncomfortable side effects of therapy can have
  a negative impact on daily activities and wellbeing, which may affect adherence.
  OBJECTIVES: To identify and assess the effectiveness of different types of interventions
  (psychological and psychosocial, educational, medication interventions, or multi-component
  interventions) and interventions specific to different age groups, to improve adherence
  to iron chelation therapy compared to another listed intervention, or standard care
  in people with SCD or thalassaemia. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL (Cochrane
  Library), MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ProQuest Dissertations & Global
  Theses, Web of Science & Social Sciences Conference Proceedings Indexes and ongoing
  trial databases (13 December 2021). We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and
  Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register (1 August 2022). SELECTION
  CRITERIA: For trials comparing medications or medication changes, only randomised
  controlled trials (RCTs) were eligible for inclusion. For studies including psychological
  and psychosocial interventions, educational interventions, or multi-component interventions,
  non-randomised studies of interventions (NRSIs), controlled before-after studies,
  and interrupted time series studies with adherence as a primary outcome were also
  eligible for inclusion. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: For this update, two authors
  independently assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias, and extracted data. We
  assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. MAIN RESULTS: We included 19
  RCTs and one NRSI published between 1997 and 2021. One trial assessed medication
  management, one assessed an education intervention (NRSI) and 18 RCTs were of medication
  interventions. Medications assessed were subcutaneous deferoxamine, and two oral
  chelating agents, deferiprone and deferasirox. We rated the certainty of evidence
  as very low to low across all outcomes identified in this review. Four trials measured
  quality of life (QoL) with validated instruments, but provided no analysable data
  and reported no difference in QoL. We identified nine comparisons of interest. 1.
  Deferiprone versus deferoxamine We are uncertain whether or not deferiprone affects
  adherence to iron chelation therapy (four RCTs, unpooled, very low-certainty evidence),
  all-cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to
  1.21; 3 RCTs, 376 participants; very low-certainty evidence), or serious adverse
  events (SAEs) (RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.83 to 2.46; 1 RCT, 228 participants; very low-certainty
  evidence).  Adherence was reported as \"good\", \"high\" or \"excellent\" by all
  seven trials, though the data could not be analysed formally: adherence ranged from
  69% to 95% (deferiprone, mean 86.6%), and 71% to 93% (deferoxamine, mean 78.8%),
  based on five trials (474 participants) only. 2. Deferasirox versus deferoxamine
  We are uncertain whether or not deferasirox affects adherence to iron chelation
  therapy (three RCTs, unpooled, very low-certainty evidence), although medication
  adherence was high in all trials. We are uncertain whether or not there is any difference
  between the drug therapies in serious adverse events (SAEs) (SCD or thalassaemia)
  or all-cause mortality (thalassaemia). 3. Deferiprone versus deferasirox We are
  uncertain if there is a difference between oral deferiprone and deferasirox based
  on a single trial in children (average age 9 to 10 years) with any hereditary haemoglobinopathy
  in adherence, SAEs and all-cause mortality. 4. Deferasirox film-coated tablet (FCT)
  versus deferasirox dispersible tablet (DT) One RCT compared deferasirox in different
  tablet forms. There may be a preference for FCTs, shown through a trend for greater
  adherence (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.22; 1 RCT, 88 participants), although medication
  adherence was high in both groups (FCT 92.9%; DT 85.3%). We are uncertain if there
  is a benefit in chelation-related AEs with FCTs. We are uncertain if there is a
  difference in the incidence of SAEs, all-cause mortality or sustained adherence.
  5. Deferiprone and deferoxamine combined versus deferiprone alone We are uncertain
  if there is a difference in adherence, though reporting was usually narrative as
  triallists report it was \"excellent\" in both groups (three RCTs, unpooled). We
  are uncertain if there is a difference in the incidence of SAEs and all-cause mortality.\
  \  6. Deferiprone and deferoxamine combined versus deferoxamine alone We are uncertain
  if there is a difference in adherence (four RCTs), SAEs (none reported in the trial
  period) and all-cause mortality (no deaths reported in the trial period). There
  was high adherence in all trials. 7. Deferiprone and deferoxamine combined versus
  deferiprone and deferasirox combined There may be a difference in favour of deferiprone
  and deferasirox (combined) in rates of adherence (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.99)
  (one RCT), although it was high (> 80%) in both groups. We are uncertain if there
  is a difference in SAEs, and no deaths were reported in the trial, so we cannot
  draw conclusions based on these data (one RCT). 8. Medication management versus
  standard care We are uncertain if there is a difference in QoL (one RCT), and we
  could not assess adherence due to a lack of reporting in the control group. 9. Education
  versus standard care One quasi-experimental (NRSI) study could not be analysed due
  to the severe baseline confounding. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The medication comparisons
  included in this review had higher than average adherence rates not accounted for
  by differences in medication administration or side effects, though often follow-up
  was not good (high dropout over longer trials), with adherence based on a per protocol
  analysis. Participants may have been selected based on higher adherence to trial
  medications at baseline. Also, within the clinical trial context, there is increased
  attention and involvement of clinicians, thus high adherence rates may be an artefact
  of trial participation. Real-world, pragmatic trials in community and clinic settings
  are needed that examine both confirmed or unconfirmed adherence strategies that
  may increase adherence to iron chelation therapy. Due to lack of evidence this review
  cannot comment on intervention strategies for different age groups."
