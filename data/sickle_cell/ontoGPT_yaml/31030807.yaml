input_text: 'Sickle Cell Disease: Monitoring, Current Treatment, and Therapeutics
  Under Development. Screening and early detection of organ injury, as well as expanded
  use of red cell transfusion and hydroxyurea in children have changed best practices
  for clinical care in sickle cell disease. The current standard of care for children
  with sickle cell disease is discussed through a review of screening recommendations,
  disease monitoring, and approach to treatment. Novel pharmacologic agents under
  investigation in clinical trials are also reviewed.'
