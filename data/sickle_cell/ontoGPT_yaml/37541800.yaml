input_text: Global burden of transfusion in sickle cell disease. Sickle cell disease
  (SCD) is the most common hereditary hemoglobinopathy. The underlying pathophysiology
  of the red blood cell (RBC) leads to pan-systemic complications which manifest at
  an early age. While curative and disease-modifying treatments exist for SCD, a key
  intervention in the management and treatment of SCD is RBC transfusion, which can
  alleviate or prevent many complications. SCD patients often require chronic RBC
  transfusion therapy which can result in complications, such as iron overload, alloimmunization
  and infection. In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), SCD patients lack appropriate
  access to healthcare such as newborn screening, health education, prophylaxis for
  infection, and treatments to reduce both mortality and SCD-related adverse effects.
  Poor access to RBCs for transfusion, coupled with donated blood not meeting safety
  standards set by the World Health Organization, presents a significant barrier for
  patients requiring chronic transfusions in LMICs. Unmet needs associated with blood
  collection, blood component processing and recipient matching all pose a serious
  problem in many LMICs, although this varies depending on geographic location, political
  organizations and economy. This review aims to provide an overview of the global
  burden of SCD, focusing on the availability of current treatments and the burden
  of chronic RBC transfusions in patients with SCD.
