input_text: 'Serial prophylactic exchange blood transfusion in pregnant women with
  sickle cell disease (TAPS-2): statistical and qualitative analysis plan for a randomised
  controlled feasibility trial.BACKGROUND: There are significant knowledge gaps regarding
  the effectiveness of serial prophylactic exchange blood transfusion (SPEBT) for
  pregnant women with sickle cell disease (SCD). The protocol for the randomised feasibility
  trial assessing SPEBT versus usual care in women with SCD (TAPS2 trial) has previously
  been published. This publication outlines the statistical and qualitative analysis
  plan for the study. METHODS AND DESIGN: TAPS2 is a randomised two-arm phase 2 feasibility
  trial with a nested qualitative study and health economic evaluation. Up to 50 pregnant
  women with SCD and a singleton pregnancy will be recruited and individually randomised
  to either SPEBT approximately every 6-10 weeks until delivery (intervention arm)
  or to usual care (control arm). Information will be collected on a range of feasibility
  and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Due to the impact of COVID-19 on study recruitment,
  the initial study period of 24 months was extended to 48 months. Other protocol
  updates designed to mitigate the impact of COVID-19-related disruption included
  allowing for remote consent and conducting all qualitative interviews by telephone.
  The primary outcome for the trial is the overall recruitment rate. The number of
  women screened, eligible, consented, randomised and withdrawn will be summarised
  as a CONSORT flow diagram. Differences in clinical outcomes will additionally be
  presented as an initial assessment of efficacy and to inform sample size calculations
  for a future definitive trial. Qualitative interviews with trial participants and
  clinicians will be analysed using reflexive thematic analysis; data from interviews
  with participants who declined to participate in the trial will be extracted and
  incorporated into summary tables to report key findings. The health economic analysis
  plan is not covered by this update. CONCLUSION: The publication of this analysis
  plan is designed to aid transparency and to reduce the potential for reporting bias.
