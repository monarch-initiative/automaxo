input_text: 'A pilot study of the effect of rivaroxaban in sickle cell anemia.INTRODUCTION:
  The contribution of coagulation activation to the pathogenesis of sickle cell disease
  (SCD) remains incompletely defined. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban,
  an oral direct factor Xa inhibitor, in subjects with sickle cell anemia. MATERIALS
  AND METHODS: In this pilot, single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
  crossover study, eligible subjects with sickle cell anemia received rivaroxaban
  or placebo. The effect of rivaroxaban on coagulation activation, endothelial activation,
  inflammation, and microvascular blood flow was evaluated. RESULTS: Fourteen patients
  (HbSS - 14; females - 9) with mean age of 38 +- 10.6 years were randomized to receive
  rivaroxaban 20 mg daily or placebo for 4 weeks and, following a 2-week washout phase,
  were "crossed-over" to the treatment arm opposite to which they were initially assigned.
  Mean adherence to treatment with rivaroxaban, assessed by pill counts, was 85.6%
  in the first treatment period and 93.6% in the second period. Treatment with rivaroxaban
  resulted in a decrease from baseline of thrombin-antithrombin complex versus placebo
  (-34.4 ug/L [95% CI: -69.4, 0.53] vs. 0.35 ug/L [95% CI: -3.8, 4.5], p = .08), but
  the difference was not statistically significant. No significant differences were
  observed in changes from baseline of D-dimer, inflammatory, and endothelial activation
  markers or measures of microvascular blood flow. Rivaroxaban was well tolerated.
  CONCLUSIONS: Rivaroxaban was safe but did not significantly decrease coagulation
  activation, endothelial activation, or inflammation. Rivaroxaban did not improve
  microvascular blood flow. Adequately powered studies are required to further evaluate
  the efficacy of rivaroxaban in SCD. Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02072668.'
