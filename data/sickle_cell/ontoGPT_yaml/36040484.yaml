input_text: Normalization of cerebral hemodynamics after hematopoietic stem cell transplant
  in children with sickle cell disease. Children with sickle cell disease (SCD) demonstrate
  cerebral hemodynamic stress and are at high risk of strokes. We hypothesized that
  curative hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) normalizes cerebral hemodynamics
  in children with SCD compared with pre-transplant baseline. Whole-brain cerebral
  blood flow (CBF) and oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) were measured by magnetic
  resonance imaging 1 to 3 months before and 12 to 24 months after HSCT in 10 children
  with SCD. Three children had prior overt strokes, 5 children had prior silent strokes,
  and 1 child had abnormal transcranial Doppler ultrasound velocities. CBF and OEF
  of HSCT recipients were compared with non-SCD control participants and with SCD
  participants receiving chronic red blood cell transfusion therapy (CRTT) before
  and after a scheduled transfusion. Seven participants received matched sibling donor
  HSCT, and 3 participants received 8 out of 8 matched unrelated donor HSCT. All received
  reduced-intensity preparation and maintained engraftment, free of hemolytic anemia
  and SCD symptoms. Pre-transplant, CBF (93.5 mL/100 g/min) and OEF (36.8%) were elevated
  compared with non-SCD control participants, declining significantly 1 to 2 years
  after HSCT (CBF, 72.7 mL/100 g per minute; P = .004; OEF, 27.0%; P = .002), with
  post-HSCT CBF and OEF similar to non-SCD control participants. Furthermore, HSCT
  recipients demonstrated greater reduction in CBF (-19.4 mL/100 g/min) and OEF (-8.1%)
  after HSCT than children with SCD receiving CRTT after a scheduled transfusion (CBF,
  -0.9 mL/100 g/min; P = .024; OEF, -3.3%; P = .001). Curative HSCT normalizes whole-brain
  hemodynamics in children with SCD. This restoration of cerebral oxygen reserve may
  explain stroke protection after HSCT in this high-risk patient population.
