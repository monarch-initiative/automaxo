input_text: 'Catastrophic Delayed Hemolytic Transfusion Reaction in a Patient With
  Sickle Cell Disease Without Alloantibodies: Case Report and Review of Literature.
  While packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusion therapy is a mainstay in the treatment
  of certain patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and the standard of care for
  preoperative management, there are associated risks. Delayed hemolytic transfusion
  reaction (DHTR) is a risk of PRBC transfusion occurring 2 to 20 days from transfusion
  and typically presents with severe pain characteristic of vaso-occlusive crisis,
  fever, and hemolytic anemia. DHTRs are uncommon, occurring in only 4% to 11% of
  transfused patients with SCD, but may be catastrophic in nature with progression
  to multiorgan failure within hours. Here, we describe a case of a 20-year-old female
  with sickle cell SS disease who developed a severe DHTR 5 days following an elective
  preoperative PRBC transfusion, and rapidly progressed to multiorgan failure and
  death. This is the first reported case of a catastrophic DHTR in a patient with
  SCD without any detectable known or new alloantibodies.'
