input_text: 'Intravenous fluid therapy and hospital outcomes for vaso-occlusive episodes
  in children, adolescents, and young adults with sickle cell disease.BACKGROUND:
  While intravenous fluid (IVF) therapy in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD)
  admitted for a vaso-occlusive episode (VOE) can help reduce red blood cell sickling,
  clinical practice varies across institutions. We examined the relationship between
  IVF therapy and hospital length of stay (HLOS), as well as adverse events, such
  as acute chest syndrome (ACS), pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) transfer, and
  28-day re-admission. METHODS: This is a single-center retrospective analysis of
  SCD VOE hospitalizations between January 2015 and April 2020. Patients with SCD,
  age 0-30, with consecutive hospitalizations for VOE were included. For the first
  3 days of each admission, an "IVF ratio" was calculated by dividing actual IVF rate
  administered by weight-based maintenance IVF (mIVF) rate. RESULTS: A total of 617
  hospitalizations for 161 patients were included. Mean HLOS was 5.7 days, (SD 3.9),
  and mean IVF volume over the first 3 days of admission was 139.6 mL/kg/day (SD 57.8).
  Multivariate analysis showed that for each additional 0.5 times the mIVF rate, HLOS
  increased by 0.53 day (p < .001; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.609-0.989), but
  there was no significant association between IVF therapy and adverse events. History
  of chronic pain was associated with increased odds of re-admission (OR 6.4; 95%
  CI: 3.93-10.52). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the theoretical potential for IVF therapy
  to slow down the sickling process, our findings suggest that increased IVF therapy
  was associated with prolonged HLOS, which places a burden on patients, families,
  and the health system.'
