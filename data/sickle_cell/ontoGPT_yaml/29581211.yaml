input_text: 'Effects of vaccines in patients with sickle cell disease: a systematic
  review protocol. INTRODUCTION: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited haematological
  disorder caused by a single point mutation (Glub6Val) that promotes polymerisation
  of haemoglobin S and sickling of erythrocytes. Inflammation, haemolysis, microvascular
  obstruction and organ damage characterise the highly variable clinical expression
  of SCD. People with SCD are at increased risk of severe infections, hence the need
  for vaccination against common disease-causing organisms in this population. We
  aim to review the evidence on the efficacy and safety of vaccines in people with
  SCD. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The present systematic review will examine the current
  data as indexed in PubMed, CENTRAL, EMBASE and EBSCOHost. We will consult Strategic
  Advisory Group of Experts practice statements, conference abstracts, reference lists
  of relevant articles, WHO ICTRP trial registry and experts in the field. Two authors
  will independently screen search outputs, select studies, extract data and assess
  risk of bias; resolving discrepancies by discussion and consensus between the two
  authors or arbitration by a third author when necessary. We will perform a meta-analysis
  for clinically homogenous studies. Evidence from clinically diverse studies will
  be aggregated using narrative synthesis of the findings. In either case, we will
  use the GRADE approach to assess the strength of the available evidence. ETHICS
  AND DISSEMINATION: The study draws on data that are readily available in the public
  domain, hence no formal ethical review and approval is required. The findings of
  this review will be disseminated through conference presentations and a publication
  in a peer-reviewed journal. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42018084051.'
