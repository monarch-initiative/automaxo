input_text: Structures of ferroportin in complex with its specific inhibitor vamifeport.A
  central regulatory mechanism of iron homeostasis in humans involves ferroportin
  (FPN), the sole cellular iron exporter, and the peptide hormone hepcidin, which
  inhibits Fe2+ transport and induces internalization and degradation of FPN. Dysregulation
  of the FPN/hepcidin axis leads to diverse pathological conditions, and consequently,
  pharmacological compounds that inhibit FPN-mediated iron transport are of high clinical
  interest. Here, we describe the cryo-electron microscopy structures of human FPN
  in complex with synthetic nanobodies and vamifeport (VIT-2763), the first clinical-stage
  oral FPN inhibitor. Vamifeport competes with hepcidin for FPN binding and is currently
  in clinical development for beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease. The structures
  display two distinct conformations of FPN, representing outward-facing and occluded
  states of the transporter. The vamifeport site is located in the center of the protein,
  where the overlap with hepcidin interactions underlies the competitive relationship
  between the two molecules. The introduction of point mutations in the binding pocket
  of vamifeport reduces its affinity to FPN, emphasizing the relevance of the structural
  data. Together, our study reveals conformational rearrangements of FPN that are
  of potential relevance for transport, and it provides initial insight into the pharmacological
  targeting of this unique iron efflux transporter.
