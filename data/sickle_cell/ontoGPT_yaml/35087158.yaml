input_text: Machine learning-based approaches for identifying human blood cells harboring
  CRISPR-mediated fetal chromatin domain ablations.Two common hemoglobinopathies,
  sickle cell disease (SCD) and beta-thalassemia, arise from genetic mutations within
  the beta-globin gene. In this work, we identified a 500-bp motif (Fetal Chromatin
  Domain, FCD) upstream of human Upsilon-globin locus and showed that the removal
  of this motif using CRISPR technology reactivates the expression of Upsilon-globin.
  Next, we present two different cell morphology-based machine learning approaches
  that can be used identify human blood cells (KU-812) that harbor CRISPR-mediated
  FCD genetic modifications. Three candidate models from the first approach, which
  uses multilayer perceptron algorithm (MLP 20-26, MLP26-18, and MLP 30-26) and flow
  cytometry-derived cellular data, yielded 0.83 precision, 0.80 recall, 0.82 accuracy,
  and 0.90 area under the ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve when predicting
  the edited cells. In comparison, the candidate model from the second approach, which
  uses deep learning (T2D5) and DIC microscopy-derived imaging data, performed with
  less accuracy (0.80) and ROC AUC (0.87). We envision that equivalent machine learning-based
  models can complement currently available genotyping protocols for specific genetic
  modifications which result in morphological changes in human cells.
