input_text: "Opioid prescriptions among the World Trade Center Health Program population.BACKGROUND:
  The World Trade Center Health Program (Program) provides limited health care to
  those directly affected by the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Because of physical/mental
  trauma arising from the 9/11 attacks, Program members might be at high risk of opioid
  use. To prevent prescription opioid overuse, in 2018 the Program implemented various
  measures to improve opioid prescribing and expand access to non-opioid pain management
  among Program members. However, the characteristics of opioid prescriptions dispensed
  among this population has never been described. METHODS: Administrative and claims
  data from 07/01/2011 to 09/30/2022 were used to describe opioid prescriptions dispensed
  during 2013-2021. RESULTS: From 2013-2021, 108,285 members were Program-enrolled
  for >= 10 months, 4,053 (3.7%) had 22,938 outpatient opioid prescriptions, of which,
  62.1% were for cancer-related pain, 11.1% for hospice/end of life care, 4.8% for
  surgery pain, and 9.8% for acute/chronic pain. Among members with Program-paid diagnostic/treatment
  claims (n = 70,721), the proportion with opioid prescriptions for cancer/hospice/end
  of life care increased from 0.5% in 2013 to 1.6% in 2018 (p = 0.010), then decreased
  to 1.1% in 2021 (p = 0.070), and the proportion for non-cancer surgery/acute/chronic
  pain decreased from 0.6% in 2013 to 0.23% in 2021 (p = 0.0005). Among members prescribed
  opioids without cancer/hospice/sickle cell disease, the proportion who started with
  long-acting opioids or had opioid prescriptions from >= 4 prescribers were below
  6.5% annually; the proportion receiving a high-dose (>= 90 morphine milligram equivalents
  per day [MED]), or with concurrent opioids and benzodiazepines use, or who started
  opioids with MED >= 50 or with long duration (>= 7 days' supply) were above 10%
  annually, but decreased since 2017. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of outpatient opioid
  prescriptions paid by the Program was very low and prescriptions were primarily
  dispensed for cancer/hospice/end of life care. Although Program efforts to improve
  opioid prescribing coincided with improvements in outcomes, ongoing surveillance
  is needed."
