input_text: 'Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in pediatric patients with sickle
  cell anemia.INTRODUCTION: Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is a hemoglobinopathy presenting
  severe endothelial damage associated with increased prevalence of hypertension (HTN).
  Few studies have used ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) in pediatric patients
  with SCA. The aim of this study was to characterize the ABPM profile in children
  with SCA. METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted on all subjects
  <18 years of age with SCA who presented at a medical reference center in the city
  of Cartagena, Colombia. Anthropometric, clinical laboratory, treatment, and ABPM
  parameters, including ambulatory arterial stiffness index (AASI) were registered.
  RESULTS: The study included 79 patients, of these, 23 (29%) children had normal
  BP, 49 (62%) had abnormal BP and 7 (9%) had HTN. Mean age was 10.5 +- 3.6 years
  and 44 (56%) cases were male. Forty-eight (60%) patients had pre-HTN. Masked HTN
  was present in 6 (8%) patients. One (1%) had ambulatory HTN, and another one (1%)
  had white coat HTN. The HTA group exhibited significantly higher systolic BP and
  diastolic BP compared to the other groups in 24-hour BP readings, daytime BP, and
  night-time BP ABPM parameters (P < 0.05), except for daytime DBP (P = 0.08). Mean
  AASI was 0.4 +- 0.2. The HTN group had the highest AASI value compared to the other
  groups (P = 0.006). CONCLUSION: Significant alterations in ABPM parameters are frequently
  observed in pediatric patients with SCA. The incorporation of ABPM, along with the
  assessment of AASI, is recommended for a comprehensive evaluation of cardiovascular
  and renal risk in SCA patients.'
