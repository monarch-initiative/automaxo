input_text: 'Bone marrow transplantation for adolescents and young adults with sickle
  cell disease: Results of a prospective multicenter pilot study. We conducted a multicenter
  pilot investigation of the safety and feasibility of bone marrow transplantation
  (BMT) in adults with severe sickle cell disease (SCD) (NCT 01565616) using a reduced
  toxicity preparative regimen of busulfan (13.2 mg/kg), fludarabine (175 mg/m2 )
  and thymoglobulin (6 mg/kg) and cyclosporine or tacrolimus and methotrexate for
  graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. Twenty-two patients (median age 22 years;
  range 17-36) were enrolled at eight centers. Seventeen patients received marrow
  from an HLA-identical sibling donor and five patients received marrow from an 8/8
  HLA-allele matched unrelated donor. Before BMT, patients had stroke, acute chest
  syndrome, recurrent pain events, were receiving regular red blood cell transfusions,
  or had an elevated tricuspid regurgitant jet (TRJ) velocity, which fulfilled eligibility
  criteria. Four patients developed grades II-III acute GVHD (18%) and six developed
  chronic GVHD (27%) that was moderate in two and severe in one patient. One patient
  died of intracranial hemorrhage and one of GVHD. Nineteen patients had stable donor
  chimerism, 1-year post-transplant. One patient who developed secondary graft failure
  survives disease-free after a second BMT. The one-year overall survival and event-free
  survival (EFS) are 91% (95% CI 68%-98%) and 86% (95% CI, 63%-95%), respectively,
  and 3-year EFS is 82%. Statistically significant improvements in the pain interference
  and physical function domains of health-related quality of life were observed. The
  study satisfied the primary endpoint of 1-year EFS >=70%. This regimen is being
  studied in a prospective clinical trial comparing HLA-matched donor BMT with standard
  of care in adults with severe SCD (NCT02766465).'
