input_text: 'Prevalence of bone complications in young patients with sickle cell disease
  presenting low bone mineral density.PURPOSE: Bone fragility in sickle cell disease
  (SCD) has been previously reported even in young patients, but the clinical consequences
  and specific management remain unclear. The objective of this study was to assess
  the prevalence of bone fragility in sickle cell patients and to evaluate the potential
  risk factors and associated complications. METHODS: We conducted a single-center
  cross-sectional study. Bone mineral densitometry (BMD) at the lumbar spine and the
  hip, Vertebral Fracture Assessment (VFA) and biological measurements were performed
  in patients aged between 20 and 40 years. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-eight
  patients with sickle cell disease were included between June 2020 and December 2021.
  One hundred and one patients (73.2 %) were from Sub-Saharan Africa, 13 from North
  Africa (9.4 %), 11 from the Caribbean (7.9 %), 6 from the Indian Ocean. A Z-score
  < -2 was found in 43 patients (31.2 %) at the lumbar spine, in 4 patients (3 %)
  at the total hip, and in 5 patients (3.7 %) at the femoral neck. 59 patients (46.8
  %) had vertebral deformities. Fragility fractures were recorded in 9 patients (10.8
  %). Patients with low BMD had lower BMI (21.3 (19.0, 24.0) versus 24.0 (20.7, 26.1)
  Kg/m2, p = 0.003), lower osteonecrosis history (7 % versus 25.3 %, p = 0.011) and
  lower hemoglobin levels (9.0 (8.0, 10.0) versus 10.0 (9.0, 11.0) g/dL, p < 0.01).
  No association was found between history of fracture and low BMD. CONCLUSION: Young
  patients with SCD commonly have low BMD at the lumbar spine, but the prevalence
  of fragility fracture was low. Low BMD - specifically at the spine - may not be
  tantamount to bone fragility.'
