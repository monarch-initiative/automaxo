input_text: "Provider Attitudes, Preferences, and Practices Regarding Sexual and Reproductive
  Health for Adolescents and Young Adults With Sickle Cell Disease. PURPOSE: With
  improvements in life expectancy, adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with sickle
  cell disease (SCD) increasingly face sexual and reproductive health (SRH) concerns.
  As subspecialists often serve as primary care providers for those with chronic disease,
  this study examines pediatric SCD providers' practices and attitudes related to
  SRH of AYA women with SCD. METHODS: We developed an adapted survey to identify SCD
  provider attitudes and practices in addressing menses, sexual activity, contraception,
  and pregnancy for their female patients. We electronically distributed this survey
  to the American Society of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology SCD interest group. We
  used descriptive statistics to analyze results. RESULTS: A total of 78 pediatric
  SCD providers completed the survey. A majority (95%) rated SRH discussions as moderately
  important or higher, with 89% agreeing this care should be standardized. Most respondents
  reported discussing SRH, such as menses (78%), teratogenic medications (61%), and
  contraception (90%), with their female patients with SCD at least annually. Although
  most refer AYAs with SCD for birth control (83%), 39% endorsed a preferred method,
  with 33% of these favoring levonorgestrel intrauterine devices in this population
  and 40% injectable contraception. Approximately half of respondents (57%) reported
  that the use of combined hormonal contraceptives was unacceptable despite published
  guidelines that support potential benefits outweighing theoretical risk in AYAs
  with SCD. CONCLUSIONS: The range of SRH conversations and contraceptive recommendations
  for AYAs from pediatric SCD providers is broad. SCD providers and AYAs with SCD
  would benefit from improved evidence and educational resources related to contraception
  as well as coordinated SRH counseling."
