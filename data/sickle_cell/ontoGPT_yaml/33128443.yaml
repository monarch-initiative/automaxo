input_text: 'Emergence of gram-negative organisms as the cause of infections in patients
  with sickle cell disease. BACKGROUND: Patients with sickle cell disease are at higher
  risk of infections with encapsulated bacteria due to immature immune responses and
  functional asplenia. We aimed to study our patient population for the emergence
  of gram-negative organisms other than Salmonella as the cause of osteomyelitis and
  document a vast decrease in Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteremia rates. METHODS:
  We conducted a retrospective chart review of 158 patients with sickle cell disease
  registered at our hospital. Over a period of 13 years, every patient presenting
  to the emergency department (ED) with fever had their medical record reviewed for
  blood cultures, wound cultures, and magnetic resonance imaging results for osteomyelitis.
  RESULTS: The number of patients presenting to the ED with fever was 105, with 581
  febrile episodes and 893 blood cultures. Among those, no culture grew Streptococcus
  pneumoniae, 14 grew coagulase-negative staphylococci (1.5%), one grew Salmonella
  enterica Paratyphi B, and three grew Salmonella enterica group C (in the same patient).
  The total number of osteomyelitis episodes in patients with sickle cell disease
  presenting with fever and documented by imaging was nine (1.5%). In patients with
  osteomyelitis, organisms were isolated in four patients (44%), including Enterobacter
  cloacae, Bacteroides, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella enterica group C. CONCLUSIONS:
  Immunization against Streptococcus pneumoniae and the use of prophylactic penicillin
  has virtually eliminated pneumococcal bacteremia among our patients. We observed
  the emergence of gram-negative organisms other than Salmonella as the cause of osteomyelitis
  in patients with sickle cell disease.'
