input_text: 'Debate: Should the loss of disability adjusted life years (DALY) define
  the focus of Global Hematology?: The case for prioritizing capacity building in
  anemia management and blood transfusion.Setting priorities in healthcare is always
  contentious given the array of possible services at primary, secondary, and tertiary
  levels of care, not to mention potential public health interventions. The central
  goals in global policy have been reducing inequity within and between countries,
  protecting vulnerable groups (particularly women and children) and reducing the
  major communicable diseases which have historically been a major burden in lower-
  and middle-income countries. Here limited relative and absolute spending on healthcare
  have spurred a series of initiatives in Global Health over the last 50 years which
  have led to significant gains in measures of morbidity and mortality. Against this
  background there remains the continuing question of how to adapt current medical
  practice in higher income countries for training and planning of services in lower-
  and middle-income countries. Here, the historical development of Global Health is
  outlined, and lessons drawn from the surveys of the global burden of disease and
  health economic analysis to understand how we can apply these principles to define
  Global Hematology. It remains likely that in lower-income countries effort should
  be concentrated on developing laboratory services and blood transfusion, to allow
  safe and effective support for the assessment of treatment of anemia, sickle cell
  disease, maternal and child health and urgent surgery and obstetric services. However,
  the principles of Global Health, could also be used for hematological malignancies
  to develop a framework for Global Hematology for all settings.'
