input_text: 'Sickle Eye Project: a cross-sectional, non-interventional study of the
  prevalence of visual impairment due to sickle cell retinopathy and maculopathy in
  the UK.INTRODUCTION: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the most common genetic
  disorders in the UK, with over 15 000 people affected. Proliferative sickle cell
  retinopathy (SCR) is a well-described complication of SCD and can result in significant
  sight loss, although the prevalence in the UK is not currently known. There are
  currently no national screening guidelines for SCR, with wide variations in the
  management of the condition across the UK. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Sickle Eye
  Project is an epidemiological, cross-sectional, non-interventional study to determine
  the prevalence of visual impairment due to SCR and/or maculopathy in the UK. Haematologists
  in at least 16 geographically dispersed hospitals in the UK linked to participating
  eye clinics will offer study participation to consecutive patients meeting the inclusion
  criteria attending the sickle cell clinic. The following study procedures will be
  performed: (a) best corrected visual acuity with habitual correction and pinhole,
  (b) dilated slit lamp biomicroscopy and funduscopy, (c) optical coherence tomography
  (OCT), (d) OCT angiography where available, (e) ultrawide fundus photography, (f)
  National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire-25 and (g) acceptability of
  retinal screening questionnaire. The primary outcome is the proportion of people
  with SCD with visual impairment defined as logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution
  >=0.3 in at least one eye. Secondary outcomes include the prevalence of each stage
  of SCR and presence of maculopathy by age and genotype; correlation of stage of
  SCR and maculopathy to severity of SCD; the impact of SCR and presence of maculopathy
  on vision-related quality of life; and the acceptability to patients of routine
  retinal imaging for SCR and maculopathy. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval
  was obtained from the South Central-Oxford A Research Ethics Committee (REC 23/SC/0363).
  Findings will be reported through academic journals in ophthalmology and haematology.'
