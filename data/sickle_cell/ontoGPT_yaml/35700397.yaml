input_text: "Transitioning Adolescents With Sickle Cell Disease From Pediatric to
  Adult Care: Results From a New Survey of Health Care Professionals. Transition from
  pediatric to adult care for adolescents and young adults (AYA) with sickle cell
  disease (SCD) comes at a time when a range of biopsychosocial issues occur simultaneously.
  A new survey sought information from physicians who treat AYA with SCD about their
  practices in how they transition pediatric patients to adult care. An online survey
  to physicians who treat SCD was conducted using SurveyMonkey between November 2019
  and January 2020. Of 209 physicians who were contacted, 58 completed the survey;
  62.1% treated primarily pediatric patients and 37.9% treated adults. Patient education
  on transition was regarded as \"important\" or \"very important\" by 94.2% of the
  physicians. Patients' knowledge about their disease and their ability to navigate
  the health care system were identified as 2 primary barriers to transition (mean
  1.30 and 1.67 on a 3-point scale, respectively). Most physicians employ established
  models to facilitate the transition, including Got Transition (41.3%) and a biopsychosocial
  model (34.8%), with 34.8% using a mix of models and 23.9% not using an established
  model. Fewer than half (34.8%) rated their program as \"very successful\" or \"\
  successful.\" Transition protocols from pediatric to adult care should be re-examined
  to facilitate successful transition for AYA with SCD."
