input_text: "Gene therapy for sickle cell disease. BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease
  encompasses a group of genetic disorders characterized by the presence of at least
  one hemoglobin S (Hb S) allele, and a second abnormal allele that could allow abnormal
  haemoglobin polymerisation leading to a symptomatic disorder. Autosomal recessive
  disorders (such as sickle cell disease) are good candidates for gene therapy because
  a normal phenotype can be restored in diseased cells with only a single normal copy
  of the mutant gene. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review.
  OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this review are: - to determine whether gene therapy
  can improve survival and prevent symptoms and complications associated with sickle
  cell disease; - to examine the risks of gene therapy against the potential long-term
  gain for people with sickle cell disease. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane
  Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register,
  which comprises of references identified from comprehensive electronic database
  searches and searching relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings.
  We also searched online trial registries, Date of the most recent search of the
  Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 21 September 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA:
  All randomised or quasi-randomised clinical trials (including any relevant phase
  1, 2 or 3 trials) of gene therapy for all individuals with sickle cell disease,
  regardless of age or setting. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: No trials of gene therapy
  for sickle cell disease were found. MAIN RESULTS: No trials of gene therapy for
  sickle cell disease were reported. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: No randomised or quasi-randomised
  clinical trials of gene therapy for sickle cell disease were reported. Thus, no
  objective conclusions or recommendations in practice can be made on gene therapy
  for sickle cell disease. This systematic review has identified the need for well-designed,
  randomised controlled trials to assess the benefits and risks of gene therapy for
  sickle cell disease."
