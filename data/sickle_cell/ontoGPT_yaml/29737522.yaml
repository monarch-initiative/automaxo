input_text: "Interventions for improving adherence to iron chelation therapy in people
  with sickle cell disease or thalassaemia. BACKGROUND: Regularly transfused people
  with sickle cell disease (SCD) and people with thalassaemia (who are transfusion-dependent
  or non-transfusion-dependent) are at risk of iron overload. Iron overload can lead
  to iron toxicity in vulnerable organs such as the heart, liver and endocrine glands;
  which can be prevented and treated with iron chelating agents. The intensive demands
  and uncomfortable side effects of therapy can have a negative impact on daily activities
  and well-being, which may affect adherence. OBJECTIVES: To identify and assess the
  effectiveness of interventions (psychological and psychosocial, educational, medication
  interventions, or multi-component interventions) to improve adherence to iron chelation
  therapy in people with SCD or thalassaemia. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL
  (the Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Psychology and Behavioral
  Sciences Collection, Web of Science Science & Social Sciences Conference Proceedings
  Indexes and ongoing trial databases (01 February 2017). We searched the Cochrane
  Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register
  (12 December 2017). SELECTION CRITERIA: For trials comparing medications or medication
  changes, only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were eligible for inclusion.For
  studies including psychological and psychosocial interventions, educational Interventions,
  or multi-component interventions, non-RCTs, controlled before-after studies, and
  interrupted time series studies with adherence as a primary outcome were also eligible
  for inclusion. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Three authors independently assessed
  trial eligibility, risk of bias and extracted data. The quality of the evidence
  was assessed using GRADE. MAIN RESULTS: We included 16 RCTs (1525 participants)
  published between 1997 and 2017. Most participants had beta-thalassaemia major;
  195 had SCD and 88 had beta-thalassaemia intermedia. Mean age ranged from 11 to
  41 years. One trial was of medication management and 15 RCTs were of medication
  interventions. Medications assessed were subcutaneous deferoxamine, and two oral-chelating
  agents, deferiprone and deferasirox.We rated the quality of evidence as low to very
  low across all outcomes identified in this review.Three trials measured quality
  of life (QoL) with validated instruments, but provided no analysable data and reported
  no difference in QoL.Deferiprone versus deferoxamineWe are uncertain whether deferiprone
  increases adherence to iron chelation therapy (four trials, very low-quality evidence).
  Results could not be combined due to considerable heterogeneity (participants' age
  and different medication regimens). Medication adherence was high (deferiprone (85%
  to 94.9%); deferoxamine (71.6% to 93%)).We are uncertain whether deferiprone increases
  the risk of agranulocytosis, risk ratio (RR) 7.88 (99% confidence interval (CI)
  0.18 to 352.39); or has any effect on all-cause mortality, RR 0.44 (95% CI 0.12
  to 1.63) (one trial; 88 participants; very low-quality evidence).Deferasirox versus
  deferoxamineWe are uncertain whether deferasirox increases adherence to iron chelation
  therapy, mean difference (MD) -1.40 (95% CI -3.66 to 0.86) (one trial; 197 participants;
  very-low quality evidence). Medication adherence was high (deferasirox (99%); deferoxamine
  (100%)). We are uncertain whether deferasirox decreases the risk of thalassaemia-related
  serious adverse events (SAEs), RR 0.95 (95% CI 0.41 to 2.17); or all-cause mortality,
  RR 0.96 (95% CI 0.06 to 15.06) (two trials; 240 participants; very low-quality evidence).We
  are uncertain whether deferasirox decreases the risk of SCD-related pain crises,
  RR 1.05 (95% CI 0.68 to 1.62); or other SCD-related SAEs, RR 1.08 (95% CI 0.77 to
  1.51) (one trial; 195 participants; very low-quality evidence).Deferasirox film-coated
  tablet (FCT) versus deferasirox dispersible tablet (DT)Deferasirox FCT may make
  little or no difference to adherence, RR 1.10 (95% CI 0.99 to 1.22) (one trial;
  173 participants; low-quality evidence). Medication adherence was high (FCT (92.9%);
  DT (85.3%)).We are uncertain if deferasirox FCT increases the incidence of SAEs,
  RR 1.22 (95% CI 0.62 to 2.37); or all-cause mortality, RR 2.97 (95% CI 0.12 to 71.81)
  (one trial; 173 participants; very low-quality evidence).Deferiprone and deferoxamine
  combined versus deferiprone alone We are uncertain if deferiprone and deferoxamine
  combined increases adherence to iron chelation therapy (very low-quality evidence).
  Medication adherence was high (deferiprone 92.7% (range 37% to 100%) to 93.6% (range
  56% to 100%); deferoxamine 70.6% (range 25% to 100%).Combination therapy may make
  little or no difference to the risk of SAEs, RR 0.15 (95% CI 0.01 to 2.81) (one
  trial; 213 participants; low-quality evidence).We are uncertain if combination therapy
  decreases all-cause mortality, RR 0.77 (95% CI 0.18 to 3.35) (two trials; 237 participants;
  very low-quality evidence).Deferiprone and deferoxamine combined versus deferoxamine
  aloneDeferiprone and deferoxamine combined may have little or no effect on adherence
  to iron chelation therapy (four trials; 216 participants; low-quality evidence).
  Medication adherence was high (deferoxamine 91.4% to 96.1%; deferiprone: 82.4%)Deferiprone
  and deferoxamine combined, may have little or no difference in SAEs or mortality
  (low-quality evidence). No SAEs occurred in three trials and were not reported in
  one trial. No deaths occurred in two trials and were not reported in two trials.Deferiprone
  and deferoxamine combined versus deferiprone and deferasirox combinedDeferiprone
  and deferasirox combined may improve adherence to iron chelation therapy, RR 0.84
  (95% CI 0.72 to 0.99) (one trial; 96 participants; low-quality evidence). Medication
  adherence was high (deferiprone and deferoxamine: 80%; deferiprone and deferasirox:
  95%).We are uncertain if deferiprone and deferasirox decreases the incidence of
  SAEs, RR 1.00 (95% CI 0.06 to 15.53) (one trial; 96 participants; very low-quality
  evidence).There were no deaths in the trial (low-quality evidence).Medication management
  versus standard careWe are uncertain if medication management improves health-related
  QoL (one trial; 48 participants; very low-quality evidence). Adherence was only
  measured in one arm of the trial. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The medication comparisons
  included in this review had higher than average adherence rates not accounted for
  by differences in medication administration or side effects.Participants may have
  been selected based on higher adherence to trial medications at baseline. Also,
  within the clinical trial context, there is increased attention and involvement
  of clinicians, thus high adherence rates may be an artefact of trial participation.Real-world,
  pragmatic trials in community and clinic settings are needed that examine both confirmed
  or unconfirmed adherence strategies that may increase adherence to iron chelation
  therapy.Due to lack of evidence this review cannot comment on intervention strategies
  for different age groups."
