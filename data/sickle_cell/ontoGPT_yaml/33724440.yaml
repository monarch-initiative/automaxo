input_text: "Prophylactic antibiotics for preventing pneumococcal infection in children
  with sickle cell disease.BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of inherited
  disorders that result in haemoglobin abnormalities and other complications. Injury
  to the spleen, among other factors, contribute to persons with SCD being particularly
  susceptible to infection. Infants and very young children are especially vulnerable.
  The 'Co-operative Study of Sickle Cell Disease' observed an incidence rate for pneumococcal
  septicaemia of 10 per 100 person-years in children under the age of three years.
  Vaccines, including customary pneumococcal vaccines, may be of limited use in this
  age group. Therefore, prophylactic penicillin regimens may be advisable for this
  population. This is an update of a Cochrane Review which was first published in
  2002, and previously updated, most recently in 2017.  OBJECTIVES: To compare the
  effects of antibiotic prophylaxis against pneumococcus in children with SCD receiving
  antibiotic prophylaxis compared to those without in relation to: 1. incidence of
  Streptococcus pneumoniae infection; 2. mortality (as reported in the included studies);
  3. drug-related adverse events (as reported in the included studies) to the individual
  and the community; 4. the impact of discontinuing at various ages on incidence of
  infection and mortality. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis
  and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, which is comprised
  of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and also
  two clinical trials registries: ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Registry
  Platform (not in 2020 given access issues relating to Covid-19 pandemic). Additionally,
  we carried out hand searching of relevant journals and abstract books of conference
  proceedings. Date of the most recent search: 25 January 2021. SELECTION CRITERIA:
  All randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing prophylactic antibiotics
  to prevent pneumococcal infection in children with SCD with placebo, no treatment
  or a comparator drug. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The standard methodological
  procedures expected by Cochrane were used. Both authors independently extracted
  data and assessed trial quality. The authors used the GRADE criteria to assess the
  certainty of the evidence. MAIN RESULTS: Six trials were identified by the searches,
  of which three trials were eligible for inclusion. A total of 880 children, who
  were between three months to five years of age at randomization were included. The
  included studies were conducted in centres in the USA and in Kingston, Jamaica.
  In trials that investigated initiation of penicillin on risk of pneumococcal infection,
  the odds ratio was 0.37 (95% confidence interval 0.16 to 0.86) (two trials, 457
  children) (low-certainty evidence), while for withdrawal the odds ratio was 0.49
  (95% confidence interval 0.09 to 2.71) (one trial, 400 children) (low-certainty
  evidence). Adverse drug effects were rare and minor. Rates of pneumococcal infection
  were found to be relatively low in children over the age of five years. Overall,
  the certainty of the evidence for all outcomes was judged to be low. The results
  from the risk of bias assessment undertaken identified two domains in which the
  risk of bias was considered to be high, these were incomplete outcome data (attrition
  bias) (two trials) and allocation concealment (selection bias) (one trial). Domains
  considered to have a low risk of bias for all three trials were selective reporting
  (reporting bias) and blinding (performance and detection bias). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS:
  The evidence examined was determined to be of low certainty and suggests that prophylactic
  penicillin significantly reduces risk of pneumococcal infection in children with
  homozygous SCD, and is associated with minimal adverse reactions. Further research
  may help to determine the ideal age to safely withdraw penicillin."
