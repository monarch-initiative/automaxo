input_text: 'Widefield oct-angiography-based classification of sickle cell retinopathy.PURPOSE:
  To assess the capillary non-perfusion in different concentric sectors on widefield
  optical coherence tomography angiography (WF-OCTA) and to correlate the ratio of
  non-perfusion (RNP) to the severity of sickle cell retinopathy (SCR). METHODS: This
  retrospective, cross-sectional study included eyes of patients with various sickle
  cell disease (SCD) genotypes having undergone WF-OCTA and ultra-widefield color
  fundus photography (UWF-CFP). Eyes were grouped as no SCR, non-proliferative SCR
  or proliferative SCR. RNP was assessed on WF-OCTA montage in different field-of-view
  (FOV) sectors centered on the fovea: 0-10-degrees circle excluding the foveal avascular
  zone, the 10-30-degrees circle excluding the optic nerve, the 30-60-degrees circle,
  and the full 60-degrees circle. RESULTS: Forty-two eyes of twenty-eight patients
  were included. Within each SCR group, mean RNP of the FOV 30-60 sector was higher
  than all other sectors (p < 0.05). Mean RNP of all sectors were significatively
  different between no SCR group and proliferative SCR group (p < 0.05). To distinguish
  no SCR versus non-proliferative SCR FOV 30-60 had a good sensitivity and specificity
  of 41.67% and 93.33%, respectively (cutoff RNP > 22.72%, AUC = 0.75, 95% CI 0.56-0.94,
  p = 0.028). To differentiate non-proliferative versus proliferative SCR, FOV 0-10
  had good sensitivity and specificity of 33.33% and 91.67%, respectively (cutoff
  RNP > 18.09, AUC = 0.73, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.93, p = 0.041). To discern no SCR versus
  proliferative SCR, all sectors had optimal sensitivity and specificity (p < 0.05).
  CONCLUSION: WF OCTA-based RNP provides non-invasive diagnostic information regarding
  the presence and severity of SCR, and correlates with disease stage in certain FOV
  sectors.'
