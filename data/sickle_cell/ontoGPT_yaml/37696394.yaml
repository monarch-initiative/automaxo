input_text: "Longitudinal Assessment of Macular Thickness and Microvascular Changes
  in Children with Sickle Cell Disease.PURPOSE: To longitudinally assess macular thickness
  and microvascular changes in children with sickle cell disease (SCD). DESIGN: A
  retrospective consecutive series. SUBJECTS: Children with SCD aged 18 years old
  or less who had an ophthalmic exam at Boston Children's Hospital between January
  1998 and August 2022. METHODS: Qualitative and quantitative analyses of both optical
  coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography (OCTA) images were performed. MAIN
  OUTCOME MEASURES: Total retinal thickness measured on macular OCT, as well as superficial
  capillary plexus (SCP) and deep capillary plexus (DCP) vessel density (VD), and
  foveal avascular zone (FAZ) area measured on 6 x 6 mm OCTA scans. RESULTS: ICD-10
  code search identified 303 pediatric SCD patients who underwent ophthalmic exam
  during the study period. OCT and OCTA images were acquired on 104 (17.2%) and 60
  (9.9%) eyes at presentation and on 159 (26.2%) and 100 (16.5%) eyes at final visit.
  Overall, temporal retinal thinning was noted qualitatively in 35.6% of SCD patients
  at presentation and 39.6% at final visit. Of those patients with macular thinning,
  94.6% and 90.5% had peripheral sickle cell retinopathy (SCR) at presentation and
  final visit. On quantitative OCT analysis, HbSS eyes had a lower retinal thickness
  in the fovea and temporal parafovea compared with HbSC, P < 0.05. Eyes with peripheral
  SCR had a larger FAZ at presentation compared to eyes without peripheral SCR (P
  = 0.004), a lower DCP VD at final visit in the inferior temporal macula (P = 0.03),
  and a higher DCP VD at final visit in the superior nasal macula (P = 0.01). 80 eyes
  of 40 patients had OCT and 34 eyes of 20 patients had both OCT and OCTA images acquired
  at both initial and final visits. At final visit, retinal thickness decreased at
  the fovea, inferior perifovea, and temporal perifovea compared to presentation,
  P < 0.05. In parallel, VD DCP in the superonasal quadrant increased at final visit,
  P = 0.03. CONCLUSIONS: Macular retinal thinning was progressive and observed in
  eyes with and without peripheral SCR. Over time, there was a compensatory increase
  in DCP VD in the nasal macula on OCTA."
