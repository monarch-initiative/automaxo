input_text: 'Elastographic evaluation of the effect of sickle cell anemia on testicles:
  a prospective study.To quantitatively determine testicular tissue stiffness values
  using shear wave elastography (SWE) in males that have sickle cell anemia (SCA)
  and to evaluate the relationship between elastography results and semen analysis
  parameters and hormone levels. Fifty patients diagnosed with SCA and followed up
  in the hematology outpatient clinic were evaluated in the urology outpatient clinic
  as the study group. In addition, there were 88 patients without any SCA-related
  complaints in the control group. We compared these groups with respect to their
  values, spermiogram parameters, testicular volume, and SWE values. Among patients
  in the SCA group, 28% had impaired sperm parameters. When testicular elastography
  was assessed, the testicular volumes were materially lower in the SCA group in comparison
  to the control group [right testicular volume: 14.76 (12.77-18.12) and 19.68 (15.12-24.18),
  respectively, p < 0.001; left testicular volume: 14.11 (11.06-17.32) and 16.59 (13.38-20.13),
  respectively, p = 0.015]. Additionally, the left testis central stiffness and the
  left testis inferior stiffness were significantly higher in the SCA group (p < 0.001
  and p = 0.014, respectively). The age and hydroxyurea use had a worse effect on
  sperm parameters in patients with SCA (odds ratio: -0.161 and -1.914, standard deviation:
  0.071 and 0.921, and p = 0.024 and p = 0.038, respectively). We consider that the
  technique utilized in this study for SWE values is fast and can be adopted as a
  reliable diagnostic tool and follow-up practice in routine clinical practice to
  evaluate the acuteness of damage to the testicles in patients having SCA.'
