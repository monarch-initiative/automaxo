input_text: 'Case report: Successful treatment with plasma exchange in life-threatening
  hyperhemolytic syndrome unrelated to sickle cell disease. INTRODUCTION: Hyperhemolytic
  syndrome (HHS) is a severe form of delayed transfusion reaction primarily described
  in sickle cell anemia patients which is characterized by a hemoglobin decrease to
  pre-transfusion levels or lower, often with reticulocytopenia and no evidence of
  auto- or allo-antibodies. CASE PRESENTATION: We present two cases of severe HHS
  in patients without sickle cell anemia refractory to treatment with steroids, immunoglobulins,
  and rituximab. In one case, temporary relief was achieved with eculizumab. In both
  cases, plasma exchange resulted in a profound and immediate response allowing for
  splenectomy and resolution of hemolysis. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: We discuss the pathophysiology
  of HHS, its presentation and treatment and expand on the possible role of plasma
  exchange in this setting.'
