input_text: 'Clinical and epidemiological features and therapeutic options of avascular
  necrosis in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD): a cross-sectional study.BACKGROUND:
  Avascular necrosis (AVN) is a debilitating complication in sickle cell disease (SCD)
  patients, and its management is usually challenging. This study aims to evaluate
  the clinical and epidemiological features and therapeutic options of AVN in sickle
  cell patients in Qatar. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted
  on a 49 SCD patients who were diagnosed with AVN and attended the hematology clinic
  at the National Center for Cancer care & research, Hamad Medical Corporation, Qatar
  between Jan-2011 to Jan2021.  Results: Forty-nine adult patients with SCD who were
  diagnosed with AVN were studied. The median age of the study population is 32 years,
  and the median age at the first AVN diagnosis was 26 years (range: 11-44 yr.). 37
  (75.5%) patients suffered from multiple joints AVN while 12(24.5%) had single joint
  involvement. 31 (63.3%) patients had bilateral hip AVN and 18 (36.7%) had shoulder
  involvement. 30 patients (61%) were on Hydroxyurea treatment. Based on FICAT and
  Alert classification of AVN, 57 % of patients had stage III and above at first diagnosis.
  20 (40.8%) were managed with a conservative approach, 11 (22.4%) received hyperbaric
  oxygen with good response, 6(12.2%) underwent hip core decompression and 12(24.5%)
  underwent hip replacement surgery. CONCLUSION: In SCD patients, AVN occurred more
  during the 3rd and 4th decades of life. The majority of AVN represented with advanced
  stage and had multiple joint involvements. We recommend adopting a low threshold
  of joint imaging for early detection and prevention of further complications.'
