input_text: Managing patients with sickle cell disease in primary care. Sickle cell
  disease (SCD) is a group of disorders affecting the hemoglobin in erythrocytes.
  SCD is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and occurs most commonly
  among people of African ancestry. In 2014, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute
  updated its guidelines for the management of SCD. These guidelines were implemented
  to provide evidence-based recommendations to assist primary care clinicians in the
  proper management of patients with SCD. This article reviews the current practice
  guidelines for SCD, with attention to health maintenance and hydroxyurea.

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  subject_extension: <A chemical or drug mentioned in the relationship between the medical action and the symptom, for example, "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  object_extension: <An optional term describing some specific aspect of the object, e.g. "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  subject: <The medical action. For example: blood transfusion, radiation therapy, cardiac catheterization, pulse oximetry, otoscopy>
  predicate: <The relationship type between the medical action and the symptom, usually TREATS or PREVENTS.>
  object: <A sign or symptom associated with the disease and targeted by the medical action. For example, Low serum calcitriol, hypoplasia of the thymus, chronic cough, aortic stiffness, low pulse pressure>
  qualifier: <The primary disease the relationship is about, or specifically the disease the symptom is related to. For example, Beck-Fahrner syndrome, hereditary retinoblastoma, progeria, diabetes mellitus, infectious otitis media>
  subject_qualifier: <An optional qualifier or modifier for the subject of the statement, e.g. "high dose" or "intravenously administered">
