input_text: "Hydroxyurea (hydroxycarbamide) for sickle cell disease. BACKGROUND: Sickle
  cell disease (SCD) is one of the most common inherited diseases worldwide. It is
  associated with lifelong morbidity and a reduced life expectancy. Hydroxyurea (hydroxycarbamide),
  an oral chemotherapeutic drug, ameliorates some of the clinical problems of SCD,
  in particular that of pain, by raising fetal haemoglobin. This is an update of a
  previously published Cochrane Review. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of hydroxyurea
  therapy in people with SCD (all genotypes), of any age, regardless of setting. SEARCH
  METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies
  Register, comprising of references identified from comprehensive electronic database
  searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference
  proceedings. We also searched online trial registries.Date of the most recent search:
  16 January 2017. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled
  trials, of one month or longer, comparing hydroxyurea with placebo, standard therapy
  or other interventions for people with SCD. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Authors
  independently assessed studies for inclusion, carried out data extraction and assessed
  the risk of bias. MAIN RESULTS: Seventeen studies were identified in the searches;
  eight randomised controlled trials were included, recruiting 899 adults and children
  with SCD (haemoglobin SS (HbSS), haemoglobin SC (HbSC) or haemoglobin Sbetaothalassaemia
  (HbSbetaothal) genotypes). Studies lasted from six to 30 months.Four studies (577
  adults and children with HbSS or HbSbetaothal) compared hydroxyurea to placebo;
  three recruited individuals with only severe disease and one recruited individuals
  with all disease severities. There were statistically significant improvements in
  terms of pain alteration (using measures such as pain crisis frequency, duration,
  intensity, hospital admissions and opoid use), measures of fetal haemoglobin and
  neutrophil counts and fewer occurrences of acute chest syndrome and blood transfusions
  in the hydroxyurea groups. There were no consistent statistically significant differences
  in terms of quality of life and adverse events (including serious or life-threatening
  events). Seven deaths occurred during the studies, but the rates by treatment group
  were not statistically significantly different.Two studies (254 children with HbSS
  or HbSbetaothal also with risk of primary or secondary stroke) compared hydroxyurea
  and phlebotomy to transfusion and chelation; there were statistically significant
  improvements in terms of measures of fetal haemoglobin and neutrophil counts, but
  more occurrences of acute chest syndrome and infections in the hydroxyurea and phlebotomy
  group. There were no consistent statistically significant differences in terms of
  pain alteration and adverse events (including serious or life-threatening events).
  Two deaths occurred during the studies (one in a the hydroxyurea treatment arm and
  one in the control arm), but the rates by treatment group were not statistically
  significantly different. In the primary prevention study, no strokes occurred in
  either treatment group but in the secondary prevention study, seven strokes occurred
  in the hydroxyurea and phlebotomy group (none in the transfusion and chelation group)
  and the study was terminated early.The quality of the evidence for the above two
  comparisons was judged as moderate to low as the studies contributing to these comparisons
  were mostly large and well designed (and at low risk of bias); however evidence
  was limited and imprecise for some outcomes such as quality of life, deaths during
  the studies and adverse events and results are applicable only to individuals with
  HbSS and HbSbetaothal genotypes.Of the remaining two studies, one (22 children with
  HbSS or HbSbetaothal also at risk of stoke) compared hydroxyurea to observation;
  there were statistically significant improvements in terms of measures of fetal
  haemoglobin and neutrophil counts but no statistically significant differences in
  terms of adverse events (including serious or life-threatening events).The final
  study (44 adults and children with HbSC) compared treatment regimens with and without
  hydroxyurea - there was statistically significant improvement in terms of measures
  of fetal haemoglobin, but no statistically significant differences in terms of adverse
  events (including serious or life-threatening events). No participants died in either
  of these studies and other outcomes relevant to the review were not reported.The
  quality of the evidence for the above two comparisons was judged to be very low
  due to the limited number of participants, the lack of statistical power (as both
  studies were terminated early with approximately only 20% of their target sample
  size recruited) and the lack of applicability to all age groups and genotypes. AUTHORS'
  CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence to suggest that hydroxyurea is effective in decreasing
  the frequency of pain episodes and other acute complications in adults and children
  with sickle cell anaemia of HbSS or HbSbetaothal genotypes and in preventing life-threatening
  neurological events in those with sickle cell anaemia at risk of primary stroke
  by maintaining transcranial doppler velocities. However, there is still insufficient
  evidence on the long-term benefits of hydroxyurea, particularly in preventing chronic
  complications of SCD, recommending a standard dose or dose escalation to maximum
  tolerated dose. There is also insufficient evidence about the long-term risks of
  hydroxyurea, including its effects on fertility and reproduction. Evidence is also
  limited on the effects of hydroxyurea on individuals with HbSC genotype. Future
  studies should be designed to address such uncertainties."
