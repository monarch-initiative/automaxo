input_text: "Sickle cell disease children's gut colonization by extended-spectrum
  beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacterales: an antibiotic prophylaxis effect?Introduction.
  Sickle cell disease (SCD) children have a high susceptibility to pneumococcal infection.
  For this reason, they are routinely immunized with pneumococcal vaccines and use
  antibiotic prophylaxis (AP).Hypothesis/Gap Statement. Yet, little is known about
  SCD children's gut microbiota. If antibiotic-resistant Enterobacterales may colonize
  people on AP, we hypothesized that SCD children on AP are colonized by resistant
  enterobacteria species.Objective. To evaluate the effect of continuous AP on Enterobacterales
  gut colonization from children with SCD.Methodology. We analysed 30 faecal swabs
  from SCD children on AP and 21 swabs from children without the same condition. Enterobacterales
  was isolated on MacConkey agar plates and identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization
  time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) (bioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France).
  We performed the antibiogram by Vitek 2 system (bioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France),
  and the resistance genes were identified by multiplex PCR.Results. We found four
  different species with resistance to one or more different antibiotic types in the
  AP-SCD children's group: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii,
  and Citrobacter farmeri. Colonization by resistant E. coli was associated with AP
  (prevalence ratio 2.69, 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1.98-3.67, P<0.001). Strains
  producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) were identified only in SCD children,
  E. coli, 4/30 (13 %), and K. pneumoniae, 2/30 (7 %). The ESBL-producing Enterobacterales
  were associated with penicillin G benzathine use (95 % CI, 22.91-86.71, P<0.001).
  CTX-M-1 was the most prevalent among ESBL-producers (3/6, 50 %), followed by CTX-M-9
  (2/6, 33 %), and CTX-M-2 (1/6, 17 %).Conclusion. Resistant enterobacteria colonize
  SCD children on AP, and this therapy raises the chance of ESBL-producing Enterobacterales
  colonization. Future studies should focus on prophylactic vaccines as exclusive
  therapy against pneumococcal infections."
