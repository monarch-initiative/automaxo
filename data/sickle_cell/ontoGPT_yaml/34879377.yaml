input_text: 'Two Sides of a Coin: Case Report of Unilateral Synangiosis and Contralateral
  Stroke Highlighting Consequences of Disease Progression and Efficacy of Revascularization
  in Sickle Cell Disease-Associated Moyamoya Syndrome.Moyamoya syndrome increases
  the risk of stroke in sickle cell disease, but revascularization surgery can modify
  this risk. Collaborative management between hematology and neurosurgery offers effective
  strategies to reduce stroke risk in these patients. We describe a challenging case
  where a patient with sickle cell disease undergoing standard of care management
  as prescribed by the Stroke Prevention Trial in Sickle Cell Anemia and revascularization
  with pial synangiosis subsequently developed rapidly progressive disease in other
  cerebral vessels and suffered ischemic hemispheric stroke. This case not only demonstrates
  the success of management in accordance with the American Heart Association (AHA)
  and American Stroke Association (ASA) guidelines but also demonstrates critical
  areas where we lack understanding of disease progression.'
