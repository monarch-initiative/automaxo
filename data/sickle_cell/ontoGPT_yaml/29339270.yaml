input_text: Proceedings From the Fourth Haploidentical Stem Cell Transplantation Symposium
  (HAPLO2016), San Diego, California, December 1, 2016. The resurgence of haploidentical
  stem cell transplantation (HaploSCT) over the last decade is one of the most important
  advances in the field of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The modified
  platforms of T cell depletion either ex vivo (CD34+ cell selection, "megadoses"
  of purified CD34+ cells, or selective depletion of T cells) or newer platforms of
  in vivo depletion of T cells, with either post-transplantation high-dose cyclophosphamide
  or intensified immune suppression, have contributed to better outcomes, with survival
  similar to that in HLA-matched donor transplantation. Further efforts are underway
  to control viral reactivation using modified T cells, improve immunologic reconstitution,
  and decrease the relapse rate post-transplantation using donor-derived cellular
  therapy products, such as genetically modified donor lymphocytes and natural killer
  cells. Improvements in treatment-related mortality have allowed the extension of
  haploidentical donor transplants to patients with hemoglobinopathies, such as thalassemia
  and sickle cell disease, and the possible development of platforms for immunotherapy
  in solid tumors. Moreover, combining HSCT from a related donor with solid organ
  transplantation could allow early tapering of immunosuppression in recipients of
  solid organ transplants and hopefully prevent organ rejection in this setting. This
  symposium summarizes some of the most important recent advances in HaploSCT and
  provides a glimpse in the future of fast growing field.
