input_text: Identifying Barriers to HPV Vaccination for Patients With Sickle Cell
  Disease and Childhood Cancer Survivors.Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination prevents
  the development of HPV-associated malignancies. Adolescent and young adult survivors
  of childhood cancers and patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) are vulnerable
  patient populations who would significantly benefit from HPV vaccination. In this
  multimethod study, a retrospective chart review found a notable difference between
  the rate of HPV vaccinations and other age-appropriate vaccinations in 177 childhood
  cancer survivors and in 70 patients with SCD. We then sought to describe patient
  and caregiver beliefs regarding HPV vaccination, through semistructured interviews
  with 21 patients and 48 caregivers. Interviews were analyzed with a thematic content
  approach to understand attitudes regarding the HPV vaccination. Qualitative interviews
  noted that many caregivers and adolescents had baseline misconceptions regarding
  the HPV vaccination in general and in context with their chronic illness. It was
  found that a strong recommendation from a trusted subspecialty provider would create
  reassurance about vaccination and reduce misconceptions and concerns about side
  effects in the context of a chronic illness. Counseling from subspecialists could
  have a strong impact on understanding the HPV vaccine in the context of chronic
  illness. This would likely help overcome many of the barriers to vaccination that
  are encountered by patients with SCD or oncology survivors.
