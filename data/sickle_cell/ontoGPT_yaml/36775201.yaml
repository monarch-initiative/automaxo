input_text: 'Multicenter Long-Term Follow-Up of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation
  with Omidubicel: A Pooled Analysis of Five Prospective Clinical Trials. Omidubicel
  is an umbilical cord blood (UCB)-derived ex vivo-expanded cellular therapy product
  that has demonstrated faster engraftment and fewer infections compared with unmanipulated
  UCB in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. Although the early benefits
  of omidubicel have been established, long-term outcomes remain unknown. We report
  on a planned pooled analysis of 5 multicenter clinical trials including 105 patients
  with hematologic malignancies or sickle cell hemoglobinopathy who underwent omidubicel
  transplantation at 26 academic transplantation centers worldwide. With a median
  follow-up of 22 months (range, .3 to 122 months), the 3-year estimated overall survival
  and disease-free survival were 62.5% and 54.0%, respectively. With up to 10 years
  of follow-up, omidubicel showed durable trilineage hematopoiesis. Serial quantitative
  assessments of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD19+, CD116+CD56+, and CD123+ immune subsets revealed
  median counts remaining within normal ranges through up to 8 years of follow-up.
  Secondary graft failure occurred in 5 patients (5%) in the first year, with no late
  cases reported. One case of donor-derived myeloid neoplasm was reported at 40 months
  post-transplantation. This was also observed in a control arm patient who received
  only unmanipulated UCB. Overall, omidubicel demonstrated stable trilineage hematopoiesis,
  immune competence, and graft durability in extended follow-up.'
