input_text: 'Identifying and Treating Severe Bone Marrow Necrosis and Fat Embolism
  Syndrome in Pediatric Patients With Sickle Cell Disease: A Case Report. Fat embolism
  syndrome after bone marrow necrosis is an extremely rare complication in sickle
  cell disease associated with significant morbidity and mortality. A high index of
  suspicion is required for diagnosis. This case report will assist pediatric clinicians
  and hematologists to recognize this severe complication in patients with sickle
  cell disease and to promptly initiate treatment. Red flags include severe bone pain,
  respiratory distress, neurological impairment, decreasing platelet count, peripheral
  leukocyte left shift, elevated nucleated red blood cells, and significant elevation
  in plasma ferritin and lactate dehydrogenase. We report a pediatric patient who
  was diagnosed early, received urgent red cell exchange transfusion and plasma exchange,
  and ultimately survived this devastating complication.'
