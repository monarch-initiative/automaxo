input_text: "Contraception and reproductive planning from the perspective of women
  with sickle cell disease. OBJECTIVE: To understand the perceptions of women with
  sickle cell disease (SCD) about reproductive planning in a public health service.
  METHOD: This is a qualitative study conducted with 15 women with SCD attended at
  a public hospital in Recife, between August 2018 and May 2019. Bardin's content
  analysis technique was used. RESULTS: The women were between 25 and 38 years old,
  married, and had low education. After the analysis, four thematic categories emerged:
  information about contraception, use of contraceptive methods, feelings about pregnancy,
  and gynecological consultation. It was found that women with SCD are influenced
  by factors such as fear of complications during pregnancy, lack of information on
  reproductive planning, partners and health professional opinion, and difficulties
  in health service access. FINAL CONSIDERATIONS: The reports demonstrate that health
  workers need to improve the way through which information reaches the patient, to
  offer a more satisfactory professional practice."
