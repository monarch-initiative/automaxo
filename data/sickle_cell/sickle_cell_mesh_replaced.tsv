38103934		The promise of genetic therapies in diseaseD000755.
37956414		Digital PCR to Measure SARS-CoV-2 RNA, Variants, and Outcomes in Youth.BACKGROUND: The role of SARS-CoV-2 viral load in predicting contagiousness, disease severity, transmissibility, and clinical decision-making continues to be an area of great interest. However, most studies have been in adults and have evaluated SARS-CoV-2 loads using cycle thresholds (Ct) values, which are not standardized preventing consistent interpretation critical to understanding clinical impact and utility. Here, a quantitative SARS-CoV-2 reverse-transcription digital PCR (RT-dPCR) assay normalized to WHO International Units was applied to children at risk of severe disease diagnosed with diseaseD000086382 at St Jude Children's Research Hospital between March 28, 2020, and January 31, 2022. METHODS: Demographic and clinical information from children, adolescents and young adults treated at St Jude Children's Research Hospital were abstracted from medical records. Respiratory samples underwent SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantitation by RT-dPCR targeting N1 and N2 genes, with sequencing to determine the genetic lineage of infecting virus. RESULTS: Four hundred and sixty-two patients aged 0-24 years (median 11 years old) were included during the study period. Most patients were infected by the omicron variant (43.72%), followed by ancestral strain (22.29%), delta (13.20%) and alpha (2.16%). Viral load at presentation ranged from 2.49 to 9.14 log10 IU/ml, and higher viral RNA loads were associated with symptoms (OR 1.32: CI95% 1.16-1.49) and diseaseD012140 (OR 1.23: CI95% 1.07-1.41). Viral load did not differ by SARS-CoV-2 variant, vaccination status, age, or baseline diagnosis. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 RNA loads predict the presence of symptomatic and diseaseD012140. The use of standardized, quantitative methods is feasible, allows for replication, comparisons across institutions, and has the potential to facilitate consensus quantitative thresholds for risk stratification and treatment.
37939877		diseaseD000755 and pregnancy.Pregnancy is a particularly risky period in the life of patients with diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755). Physiological changes during pregnancy increase the risk of diseaseD013224 (diseaseD013224), diseaseD056586, diseaseD054556 events, and diseaseD007239. This concerns haemoglobin (Hb) S/C and S/diseaseD017086 patients as much than diseaseD018455/S or diseaseD018455/beta0-thalassaemia patients. diseaseD000755 also increases the risk of obstetrical complications, such as diseaseD011225, in utero diseaseD003643, diseaseD047928 mostly induced, and diseaseD005317. Thus, pregnancy should be planned and closely monitored by a multidisciplinary team involving obstetricians and diseaseD000755 specialists. Before pregnancy, the parents should also be informed about the risk of transmission of this diseaseD030342, and the father should therefore be prescribed haemoglobin electrophoresis. Treatments have to be revised when planning pregnancy: chemicalD006918 (chemicalD006918) should be stopped as soon as pregnancy is suspected or confirmed. Preventive blood transfusion is not systematic, but is recommended in the case of a pre-existing transfusion program prior to pregnancy, severe pre-existing diseaseD000092124, severe obstetric history, and severe or repeated crises during follow-up, especially in patients taking chemicalD006918 before. Despite the risks of diseaseC536271, systematic administration of corticosteroids for foetal lung maturation is not recommended due to the risk of maternal diseaseD002318. Although more frequent, due to obstetrical and maternal complications, caesarean section is not systematic, in the absence of maternal contraindications. It is advisable not to exceed the term of 39 weeks of diseaseC537962. Post-partum follow-up is recommended, particularly because of the risk of diseaseD013923.
37967611	Negative_Correlation|chemicalD006918|diseaseD006976	diseaseD006976 in diseaseD000755.diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755) is a complex diseaseD030342 that has long challenged both patients and healthcare professionals. One of its chronic and debilitating complications is diseaseD006976 (diseaseD006976). diseaseD000755-associated diseaseD006976 is often post-capillary, secondary to diseaseD006331. It can also sometimes be pre-capillary with multiple and often interrelated mechanisms including obstructive remodeling of the pulmonary vascular bed secondary to diseaseD006461, diseaseD014652, diseaseD013927, diseaseD000860, or associated risk factors like diseaseD006975. Screening symptomatic patients with echocardiographic signs of diseaseD006976 is crucial to determine those who should undergo right heart catheterization, the cornerstone exam to diagnose and categorize patients with diseaseD006976. The workup following the diagnosis relies on identifying the cause of diseaseD006976 to personalize treatment. Ongoing efforts are made to treat this complex condition, starting with treating the underlying disease with chemicalD006918 or chronic blood exchange transfusion. Robust data on the efficacy of ncbi5053-specific therapies are lacking in this specific population. Initiation of such therapies must be made by an expert center after a case-by-case assessment of the benefit-risk ratio according to the phenotype and the mechanisms involved in the development of diseaseD006976. Efforts are also poured into studying the interventional and medical therapies used on chronic diseaseD011655 for patients presenting with a diseaseD013927 form. The management of those patients requires a multidisciplinary approach, with conjoint efforts from diseaseD006976 and diseaseD000755 specialists.
38066873		Alloimmunization and hyperhemolysis in diseaseD000755.Alloimmunization against red blood cell antigens and delayed diseaseD006461 transfusion reaction (DHTR) are major barriers to transfusion in diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755). In diseaseD000755, DHTR is a potentially life-threatening. Blood group polymorphism in diseaseD000755 9606, who are of African ancestry and frequently exposed to antigens they do not carry; an diseaseD007249 clinical state; and occasional transfusion in acute situations are risk factors for alloimmunization and DHTR. In 9606 at risk, the transfusion indication must be balanced against the risk of developing DHTR. However, when transfusion is absolutely necessary, protocols combining the prevention of exposure to immunogenic antigens with immunosuppressive treatments must be implemented, and 9606 should be carefully monitored during posttransfusion follow-up. This close monitoring makes it possible to diagnose hyperhemolysis as soon as possible; to avoid retransfusion, which can exacerbate diseaseD006461; and to administer specific treatments, such as anticomplement therapy, in severe cases. Finally, in 9606 with severe disease, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation may be indicated. However, transfusion is also required in this context, and its management is complex because these risks must be taken into account.
38190311		An Updated Equitable Model of Readiness for Transition to Adult Care: Content Validation in Young People With diseaseD000755.IMPORTANCE: Despite elevated health risks during young adulthood, many adolescents and young adults with serious health care needs face barriers during the transfer to an adult specialty practitioner, and health disparities may occur during the transition. OBJECTIVE: To validate the content of an updated Social-Ecological Model of Adolescent and Young Adult Readiness for Transition to Promote Health Equity (SMART-E) in a group of adolescents and young adults with diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755) and their supports. DESIGN, SETTING, AND 9606: Health equity framework components were reviewed. Systems of power (eg, institutional and practitioner bias) and environments or networks (eg, peer or school support) were added as SMART-E preexisting factors, and health literacy was included within readiness factors. Adolescents and young adults aged 16 to 29 years with diseaseD000755, caregivers, and practitioners participated in this convergent, mixed-methods study within Children's Hospital of Philadelphia between January and August 2022. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Content validity was assessed through nominations of top 3 most important transition barriers prior to interviews and focus groups, ratings on importance of SMART-E factors (0-4 scale; ratings >2 support validity) after interviews and focus groups, nominations of 3 most important factors for transition and for health equity, and qualitative content analysis of interview transcripts. RESULTS: The study enrolled 10 pediatric adolescents and young adults (mean [SD] age, 18.6 [2.9] years; 4 female and 6 male), 10 transferred adolescents and young adults (mean [SD] age, 22.9 [2.1] years; 8 female and 2 male), 9 caregivers (mean [SD] age, 49.8 [8.7] years; 5 female and 4 male), and 9 practitioners (mean [SD] age, 45.6 [10.5] years; 8 female and 1 male). Quantitative ratings supported the content validity of SMART-E and met established criteria for validity. Systems of power was the most endorsed transition barrier (14 of 38 9606) reported prior to interviews and focus groups. After the interview, 9606 endorsed all SMART-E factors as important for transition, with new factors systems of power and environments and networks rated at a mean (SD) 2.8 (1.23) and 3.1 (0.90), respectively, on a 0 to 4 scale of importance. The most important factors for transition and equity varied by participant group, with all factors being endorsed, supporting the comprehensiveness of SMART-E. Qualitative data corroborated quantitative findings, further supporting validity, and minor modifications were made to definitions. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: SMART-E obtained initial content validation with inclusion of health equity factors for adolescents and young adults with diseaseD000755, caregivers, and practitioners. The model should be evaluated in other populations of adolescents and young adults with diseaseD002908.
37858508	Negative_Correlation|chemicalD006918|diseaseD000755	The evolving treatment landscape for children with diseaseD000755.diseaseD000755 is the most common diseaseD030342. Over the past 30 years, disease-related morbidity and mortality have improved in high-income countries due to advances in preventive care and treatments. Established disease-modifying therapies, such as chemicalD006918 (hydrocarbamide), are continuing to have an important role in the treatment of diseaseD000755, and newer agents also show promise. In the past 5 years, the US Food and Drug Administration approved three additional diseaseD000755-modifying medications, and new gene therapies have been developed as an alternative curative treatment to haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. In this Review, we discuss the current treatment landscape for paediatric diseaseD000755 and emerging innovations in care. We also review the need for close, long-term management for children receiving newer therapies and the importance of ongoing investment in people with diseaseD000755 in low-income and middle-income countries.
38037041		Opioid prescriptions among the World Trade Center Health Program population.BACKGROUND: The World Trade Center Health Program (Program) provides limited health care to those directly affected by the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Because of diseaseD000070617 arising from the 9/11 attacks, Program members might be at high risk of opioid use. To prevent prescription opioid overuse, in 2018 the Program implemented various measures to improve opioid prescribing and expand access to non-opioid diseaseD010146 management among Program members. However, the characteristics of opioid prescriptions dispensed among this population has never been described. METHODS: Administrative and claims data from 07/01/2011 to 09/30/2022 were used to describe opioid prescriptions dispensed during 2013-2021. RESULTS: From 2013-2021, 108,285 members were Program-enrolled for >= 10 months, 4,053 (3.7%) had 22,938 outpatient opioid prescriptions, of which, 62.1% were for diseaseD009369-related diseaseD010146, 11.1% for hospice/end of life care, 4.8% for surgery diseaseD010146, and 9.8% for diseaseD059787. Among members with Program-paid diagnostic/treatment claims (n = 70,721), the proportion with opioid prescriptions for diseaseD009369/hospice/end of life care increased from 0.5% in 2013 to 1.6% in 2018 (p = 0.010), then decreased to 1.1% in 2021 (p = 0.070), and the proportion for non-diseaseD009369 surgery/diseaseD059787 decreased from 0.6% in 2013 to 0.23% in 2021 (p = 0.0005). Among members prescribed opioids without diseaseD009369/hospice/diseaseD000755, the proportion who started with long-acting opioids or had opioid prescriptions from >= 4 prescribers were below 6.5% annually; the proportion receiving a high-dose (>= 90 chemicalD009020 milligram equivalents per day [MED]), or with concurrent opioids and chemicalD001569 use, or who started opioids with MED >= 50 or with long duration (>= 7 days' supply) were above 10% annually, but decreased since 2017. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of outpatient opioid prescriptions paid by the Program was very low and prescriptions were primarily dispensed for diseaseD009369/hospice/end of life care. Although Program efforts to improve opioid prescribing coincided with improvements in outcomes, ongoing surveillance is needed.
38224366		Enhancing diagnostic precision for diseaseD056586 in diseaseD000755: insights from dual-energy CT lung perfusion mapping.PURPOSE: diseaseD056586 (diseaseD056586) is secondary to occlusion of the pulmonary vasculature and a potentially life-threatening complication of diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755). Dual-energy CT (DECT) iodine perfusion map reconstructions can provide a method to visualize and quantify the extent of pulmonary microthrombi. METHODS: A total of 102 9606 with diseaseD000755 who underwent DECT CTPA with perfusion were retrospectively identified. The presence or absence of diseaseD003318, segmental perfusion defects, and diseaseD012120 was noted. The number of segmental perfusion defects between 9606 with and without diseaseD056586 was compared. Sub-analyses were performed to investigate robustness. RESULTS: Of the 102 9606, 68 were clinically determined to not have diseaseD056586 and 34 were determined to have diseaseD056586 by clinical criteria. Of the 9606 with diseaseD056586, 82.4% were found to have perfusion defects with a median of 2 perfusion defects per 9606. The presence of any or new perfusion defects was significantly associated with the diagnosis of diseaseD056586 (P = 0.005 and < 0.001, respectively). Excluding 9606 with diseaseD011655, 79% of 9606 with diseaseD056586 had old or new perfusion defects, and the specificity for new perfusion defects was 87%, higher than consolidation/ground glass opacities (80%). CONCLUSION: DECT iodine map has the capability to depict microthrombi as perfusion defects. The presence of segmental perfusion defects on dual-energy CT maps was found to be associated with diseaseD056586 with potential for improved specificity and reclassification.
38302120		Comprehensive Care in diseaseD000755.Despite advancements in diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755) management, individuals with diseaseD000755 continue to face greater degrees of mortality, disability, and health care barriers compared with their healthy peers. Comprehensive care includes essential elements such as newborn screening, key immunizations, penicillin prophylaxis, and consistent health screening for common complications. Pediatricians should be familiar with treatment options for diseaseD000755 to offer informed education to both 9606 and their families. By providing guided and comprehensive care, pediatricians have the potential to enhance both the quantity and quality of life for individuals living with diseaseD000755.

37948742		diseaseC537858 AND diseaseD000014 IN diseaseD000755.PURPOSE: The primary aim was to describe patterns of para macular involvement, not yet reported but that OCT-A can now detect in diseaseC536778 patients. The secondary aim was to search arguments concerning the physio pathogeny of para macular involvement. METHODS: This institutional cohort retrospective study was conducted in a Referral Center for diseaseD035583. Follow-up included an ophthalmological examination with optical coherent tomography and optical coherent tomography angiography. RESULTS: Hundred and thirty-two diseaseD000755 patients were included. Typical diseaseD000755 was observed in temporal area in 84 eyes (40.0 %) of SS patients and 8 eyes (14.8 %) of diseaseD006450 patients (p < 0.001). Enlargement of the foveal avascular zone was observed in 10 eyes whom 8 of SS patients. Two atypical parafoveal abnormalities were found in SS patients only. The first one consisted in macular thinning with normal vascularization in 15 eyes of 11 patients. The second atypical diseaseD008268 was large areas of loss of vascularization without retina thinning 10 eyes of six patients. Multivariate analysis did not show a statistically significant relation between the PSR stage and the different type of diseaseD000755 (p = 0.21). CONCLUSION: Those atypical diseaseD000755 may correspond to early forms preceding a typical SCM. This would point towards several physiopathogenic mechanisms. The first one included the existence of diseaseD007511 which can be related to diseaseD000740. Presence of diseaseD012173 without vascular involvement point out to a neurogenic mechanism.
38302121		Disease-Modifying Therapies for diseaseD000755-An Overview.diseaseD000755 refers to a group of diseaseD025861 in which hemoglobin polymerization leads to diseaseD006461 and diseaseD001157. This causes a myriad of complications during a 9606's life span, ranging from diseaseD000740, diseaseD007239, and diseaseD059787 to diseaseD020521 and diseaseD009102. Although there have been dramatic improvements in childhood survival thanks to improved supportive care with penicillin prophylaxis, immunizations, and improved transfusion practices, there was a dearth of disease-modifying therapies, with hydroxyurea being the only medication for >20 years. Here, we discuss the newer therapies for diseaseD000755 that have emerged in recent years. [Pediatr Ann. 2024;53(2):e52-e55.].

37939905	Cotreatment|chemicalD002047|chemicalD009270; Negative_Correlation|chemicalD009270|diseaseD009293; Negative_Correlation|chemicalD002047|diseaseD009293	Evaluation of diseaseD009293 treatment outcomes in patients receiving split daily versus once daily dosing of chemicalD002047-chemicalD009270.INTRODUCTION: In clinical practice, sublingual (SL) chemicalD002047-chemicalD009270 is prescribed as once daily or split daily dosing for the management of diseaseD009293 (diseaseD009293). Evidence is lacking that assesses how split daily chemicalD002047-chemicalD009270 affects diseaseD009293 outcomes. This study aims to evaluate how the dosing frequency of SL chemicalD002047-chemicalD009270 impacts therapy effectiveness when treating patients with diseaseD009293. METHODS: This retrospective analysis included adult outpatients prescribed treatment with SL chemicalD002047-chemicalD009270 for diseaseD009293 between July 1, 2016, and March 1, 2020. The study excluded patients with diseaseD000755, recent chemicalD008691 treatment, or pregnancy. We characterized study groups by dosing frequency, either once daily or split dosing. The study compared retention in treatment, medication adherence, adherence to treatment program, and hospital encounters between groups. RESULTS: The study screened eight-hundred and seven patients, and included 250 patients newly prescribed SL chemicalD002047-chemicalD009270. Fifty-seven patients (22.8 %) were prescribed once daily dosing and 193 patients (77.2 %) were prescribed split daily dosing. The study found no significant differences noted in 12-month rates of treatment retention (52.6 % vs. 45.6 %, p = .35). These outcomes remained similar when assessed at three and six months. Within a year of chemicalD002047-chemicalD009270 initiation, the study found no differences in the percentage of patients with hospitalizations (26.3 % vs. 38.3 %, p = .10), median number of hospitalizations (2 vs. 2), or proportion of days covered by a prescription >=80 % (93.3 % vs. 92.0 %, p = .82). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, patients receiving once daily chemicalD002047-chemicalD009270 had similar treatment outcomes to patients receiving split dosing. Further controlled studies are necessary to evaluate which patients are more likely to benefit from split dosing.
38308541		Adverse pregnancy, fetal and neonatal outcomes in 9606 with diseaseD000755 in a Middle Eastern country.BACKGROUND: diseaseD000755 in pregnancy is associated with high maternal and fetal mortality. However, studies reporting pregnancy, fetal, and neonatal outcomes in 9606 with diseaseD000755 are extremely limited. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of the study are to determine whether 9606 with diseaseD000755 have a greater risk of adverse pregnancy, fetal, and neonatal outcomes than 9606 without diseaseD000755 and identify the predictors of adverse pregnancy, fetal, and neonatal outcomes in 9606 with diseaseD000755. DESIGN: A retrospective pair-matched case-control study was conducted to compare 171 pregnant 9606 with diseaseD000755 to 171 pregnant 9606 without diseaseD000755 in Muscat, Sultanate of Oman. METHODS: All pregnant Omani 9606 with diseaseD000755 who delivered between January 2015 and August 2021 at Sultan Qaboos University Hospital and Royal Hospital, who were either primipara or multipara and who had a gestational age of 24-42 weeks, were included as 9606, whereas 9606 who had no diseaseD000755 or any comorbidity during pregnancy, who delivered within the same timeframe and at the same hospitals, were recruited as controls. The data were retrieved from electronic medical records and delivery registry books between January 2015 and August 2021. RESULTS: 9606 with diseaseD000755 who had severe diseaseD000740 had increased odds of (chi2 = 58.56, p < 0.001) having adverse pregnancy outcomes. 9606 with diseaseD000755 had 21.97% higher odds of delivering a baby with diseaseD005317 (chi2 = 17.80, unadjusted odds ratio = 2.91-166.13, p < 0.001). Newborns born to 9606 with diseaseD000755 had 3.93% greater odds of being admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (chi2 = 16.80, unadjusted odds ratio = 1.97-7.84, p < 0.001). In addition, the children born to 9606 with diseaseD000755 had 10.90% higher odds of being born with low birth weight (chi2 = 56.92, unadjusted odds ratio = 5.36-22.16, p < 0.001). Hemoglobin level (odds ratio = 0.17, p < 0.001, 95% confidence interval = 0.10-3.0), past medical history (odds ratio = 7.95, p < 0.001, 95% confidence interval = 2.39-26.43), past surgical history (odds ratio = 17.69, p < 0.001, 95% confidence interval = 3.41-91.76), and diseaseD047928 (odds ratio = 9.48, p = 0.005, 95% confidence interval = 1.95-46.23) were identified as predictors of adverse pregnancy, fetal, and neonatal outcomes in 9606 with diseaseD000755. CONCLUSION: As pregnant 9606 with diseaseD000755 are at increased risk for pregnancy, fetal, and neonatal adverse outcomes; improved antenatal surveillance and management may improve the outcomes.
37982216		diseaseD002544 in Iraqi Patients with diseaseD000755.Silent diseaseD007238 have been reported to be the most frequent diseaseD009461 in diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755) in several studies worldwide. However, no previous studies investigated this diseaseD009461 in Iraqi diseaseD000755 patients. To address this issue, a total of 52 patients with a median age of 20 years (range 10-46) and including 46.2% males were enrolled. Patients were clinically evaluated and their records were reviewed. They had full blood and reticulocyte counts, hemoglobin F estimation, serum lactic dehydrogenase and chemicalD001663 assayed, as well as brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to screen for diseaseD002544. Six out of the 52 patients (11.5%) had diseaseD002544, all of which were in the deep white matter, ranging from 6 to 10 mm in their largest diameters. There were no significant differences in age, sex, or sickle cell genotype between those with diseaseD002544 and those without it. Those with diseaseD002544 had lower median hemoglobin, higher reticulocytes and lower diseaseD010146 frequencies than those without it, yet again this was not significant. Follow up MRI in four out of the six silent diseaseD007238 patients showed no additional lesions and no increase in size of the original ones after six to eight months. In conclusion, it appears that the frequency of diseaseD002544 in Iraqi diseaseD000755 patients is lower than the bulk of the literature from other populations. Further studies to screen for genetic polymorphisms that may explain this lower rate may be informative.
38331925		Role of hydroxyurea therapy in the prevention of diseaseD000092124 in diseaseD000755: a systematic review and meta-analysis.BACKGROUND: Hydroxyurea is an affordable drug that reduces diseaseD013224 and transfusion requirements in diseaseD000755. However, its effectiveness in preventing chronic diseaseD000092124 is still unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the role of hydroxyurea in preventing organ morbidity. METHOD: We included original articles published in English from 1st January 1990 to 31st January 2023, reporting hydroxyurea therapy and diseaseD000092124 from PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, and CrossRef databases. A total of 45 studies with 4681 diseaseD000755 9606 were evaluated for diseaseD000092124. RESULTS: Our analysis showed that hydroxyurea intervention significantly lowered transcranial Doppler and tricuspid regurgitant velocity, with a standardized mean difference of - 1.03 (- 1.49; - 0.58); I 2 = 96% and - 1.37 (CI - 2.31, - 0.42); I 2 = 94%, respectively. Moreover, the pooled estimate for diseaseD000419 showed a beneficial effect post-hydroxyurea therapy by reducing the risk of diseaseD000419 by 58% (risk ratio of 0.42 (0.28; 0.63); I 2 = 28%). CONCLUSION: Our study found that a hydroxyurea dose above 20 mg/kg/day with a mean rise in HbF by 18.46% post-hydroxyurea therapy had a beneficial role in reducing transcranial doppler velocity, tricuspid regurgitant velocity, diseaseD000419, and diseaseD013158.

38429041		The Inequality of diseaseD010146 Control in 9606 With diseaseD010146 From diseaseD000755: A Case Report.Approximately 100,000 people in the United States are affected by diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755). diseaseD059787 and diseaseD059350 are common and are experienced by everyone with diseaseD000755. Children and adolescents who had diseaseD010146 from diseaseD000755 reported daily diseaseD010146, decreased function, missed school/workdays, and limited participation in recreational and social activities. This case report aims to highlight the lack of diversity, equity, and inclusion of diseaseD010146 control through the lens of a 9606 with diseaseD000755 to improve clinical practice.
37939876		Prevention of diseaseD013901 in children with diseaseD000755 in the real-world setting: What adult medicine physicians should know.diseaseD013901 represent one of the most detrimental manifestations of diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755), affecting many patients since infancy. They include overt diseaseD020521, silent diseaseD002544 and diseaseD019965. In fact, neurodevelopment can be impaired in children resulting in diseaseD003072 in adults with diseaseD000755. This review is meant to resume the most recent guidelines about the prevention of diseaseD000755 diseaseD013901 and to highlight the open challenges in their implementation. Transcranial Doppler, Magnetic Resonance Imaging/Angiography and neurocognitive test are useful screening tools. Chronic transfusion regimen, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and neurocognitive rehabilitation find indications in the context of primary and secondary prevention of diseaseD013901 of diseaseD000755. However, international guidelines are often difficult to bring into the real world due to the lack of appropriate instruments and trained personnel. Many challenges have still to be faced to guarantee the best possible neurocognitive function to each child affected by diseaseD000755.
37883315		Longer length peripheral catheters in diseaseD000755 treatment: a more efficient and cost-effective care pathway.Patients with diseaseD000755 require frequent venous access for red blood cell exchange transfusions to manage their condition. Such frequent access can lead to scar tissue formation, increased diseaseD010146 on insertion, and difficult vascular access for the patients. Previous attempts at achieving successful venous access for patients with difficult venous access has been made with central venous lines, usually femoral lines, which required a large amount of nursing input and resulted in diseaseD001007 and diseaseD010146 on insertion for patients. In this article, the author reports on a new pathway with a longer-length peripheral intravenous catheter that reduces the nursing time burden during line insertion, requires less equipment and, crucially, results in a less painful procedure for patients. The increased efficiency of the pathway resulted in a cost saving of $149 per insertion, and patient feedback revealed that the longer-length catheter was preferred over femoral lines.
37917573		diseaseD007238 in a Child with diseaseD000755: A Case of Misdiagnosed diseaseD002481.BACKGROUND diseaseD000755 is a rare complication of diseaseD000755 that closely mimics other conditions, such as diseaseD054517 and diseaseD010019. We report a case of diseaseD007238 masquerading as diseaseD002481 in a child with diseaseD000755. CASE REPORT A 4-year-old Saudi girl with diseaseD000755 presented to our hospital with diseaseD001157 characterized by bilateral lower limb diseaseD010146 and painless left diseaseD009916. On examination, she had diseaseD005141 with redness and mild diseaseC564553 (margin reflex distance 1 was 2 mm) without diseaseD005094. Magnetic resonance imaging with contrast showed bilateral sub-periosteal heterogeneous collections (2x0.8x2.1 cm in the superolateral wall of the left orbit and 1x0.6 cm in the inferolateral wall of the right orbit), with intermediate-to-high T1 signal intensity and high T2 signal, causing a mass effect on the adjacent superior and lateral rectus muscles. The patient was treated with systemic antibiotics and supportive treatment for diseaseD001157 under the care of the pediatric team and was discharged without complications. CONCLUSIONS The diagnosis of diseaseD000755 can be challenging, and an accurate diagnosis is essential to ensure appropriate management. Thus, we report the case of a 4-year-old child with painless diseaseD000755 masquerading as diseaseD002481.
37996648	Association|diseaseD000755|ncbi947; Association|diseaseD009369|ncbi7852	Motixafortide: First Approval.Motixafortide (APHEXDATM) is a selective ncbi7852 (ncbi7852) inhibitor being developed by BioLineRx under licence from Biokine Therapeutics for the mobilization of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and the treatment of various diseaseD009369.

38206762		Managing diseaseD000755 and related diseaseD008107 in pregnancy: results of an international Delphi panel.Data to guide evidence-based management of pregnant 9606 with diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755) is limited. This international Delphi panel aimed to identify consensus among multidisciplinary experts for diseaseD000755 management during pregnancy. The two-round Delphi process used questionnaires exploring seven topics (antenatal care, hydroxyurea use, transfusion, prevention of diseaseD008107, treatment of diseaseD008107, delivery and follow-up, and bottlenecks and knowledge gaps) developed by a steering committee. Thirteen panelists (hematologists, physiologists, obstetricians, maternal fetal medicine and transfusion medicine physicians) from the US, the UK, Turkey and France completed the first survey; 12 panelists completed the second round. Anonymized responses were collected and summarized by a contract research organization (Akkodis Belgium). Consensus/strong consensus was predefined as 75%-90% (9-10/12)/>90% ( 11/12) of panelists agreeing or disagreeing on a response to a predefined clinical scenario or statement. In several areas of diseaseD000755 management, consensus was achieved: experts recommended performing at least monthly multidisciplinary antenatal follow-up, administering prophylactic aspirin for diseaseD011225 prevention between gestational weeks 12-36, initiating prophylactic transfusion therapy in certain cases, or choosing automated red blood cell exchange over other transfusion methods in 9606 with diseaseD019190 or severe acute diseaseD056586. No consensus was reached on several topics including the prophylactic aspirin dose, indications for starting diseaseD007239 prophylaxis, routine use of prophylactic transfusions, or use of prophylactic transfusions for preventing fetal diseaseD008107. These recommendations could inform clinical care for pregnant diseaseD000755 9606 in the absence of large clinical trials involving this population; the identified knowledge gaps can orient future research.
38321797		Clinicopathologic Study of diseaseD000755: A Nigerian Experience.BACKGROUND: Improvements in diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755) care have resulted in the survival of many 9606 into adulthood, although this is accompanied by the increased incidence of diseaseC564816, including diseaseD051436 (diseaseD051436). OBJECTIVES: This study assessed the prevalence, pattern and predictors of diseaseD007674 in diseaseD000755 9606 and investigated the associated renal histopathologic changes. METHODS: We evaluated 105 9606 with diseaseD000755, for diseaseD011507, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and diseaseD005198. Renal biopsy was conducted on 22 9606 who qualified. Data were analysed using SPSS package version 23. RESULTS: Thirty-seven (35.2%) of the 105 9606 had diseaseD051436, as defined by an eGFR of 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 and/or diseaseD011507. The fractional excretion of potassium (FEK) was elevated in all 9606, whereas the fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) was elevated in 98.1%. Glomerular filtration rate was negatively correlated with irreversible percentage sickle cell count (r = -0.616, P = 0.0001), FEK (r = -0.448, P = 0.0001) and FENa (r = -0.336, P = 0.004). Age, irreversible percentage sickle cell count, haemoglobin levels and FENa were the major predictors of diseaseD051436. The histological pattern in the 22 9606 who had biopsies was consistent with diseaseD005921 11 (50%), diseaseD009402 6 (27.3%), diseaseD005923 3 (13.6%) and diseaseD009395 2 (9.1%). CONCLUSIONS: diseaseD051436 was prevalent in diseaseD000755 9606, and it was characterised by diseaseD005198 and diseaseD005921. The main predictors of diseaseD051436 were increased age, severity of diseaseD001157, worsening diseaseD000743 and diseaseD005198.
38418238		Sickle Eye Project: a cross-sectional, non-interventional study of the prevalence of diseaseD014786 due to diseaseD000755 and diseaseD008268 in the UK.INTRODUCTION: diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755) is one of the most common diseaseD030342 in the UK, with over 15 000 people affected. diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755) is a well-described complication of diseaseD000755 and can result in significant diseaseD016388, although the prevalence in the UK is not currently known. There are currently no national screening guidelines for diseaseD000755, with wide variations in the management of the condition across the UK. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Sickle Eye Project is an epidemiological, cross-sectional, non-interventional study to determine the prevalence of diseaseD014786 due to diseaseD000755 and/or diseaseD008268 in the UK. Haematologists in at least 16 geographically dispersed hospitals in the UK linked to participating eye clinics will offer study participation to consecutive 9606 meeting the inclusion criteria attending the diseaseD000755 clinic. The following study procedures will be performed: (a) best corrected visual acuity with habitual correction and pinhole, (b) dilated slit lamp biomicroscopy and funduscopy, (c) optical coherence tomography (OCT), (d) OCT angiography where available, (e) ultrawide fundus photography, (f) National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire-25 and (g) acceptability of retinal screening questionnaire. The primary outcome is the proportion of people with diseaseD000755 with diseaseD014786 defined as logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution >=0.3 in at least one eye. Secondary outcomes include the prevalence of each stage of diseaseD000755 and presence of diseaseD008268 by age and genotype; correlation of stage of diseaseD000755 and diseaseD008268 to severity of diseaseD000755; the impact of diseaseD000755 and presence of diseaseD008268 on vision-related quality of life; and the acceptability to 9606 of routine retinal imaging for diseaseD000755 and diseaseD008268. diseaseD009103: Ethical approval was obtained from the South Central-Oxford A Research Ethics Committee (REC 23/SC/0363). Findings will be reported through academic journals in ophthalmology and haematology.
37795523		Busulfan-fludarabine- or treosulfan-fludarabine-based conditioning before allogeneic HSCT from matched sibling donors in paediatric patients with diseaseD000755: A study on behalf of the EBMT diseaseD004194 and Inborn Errors Working Parties.How important is choice of conditioning regimen in allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755)? We compared HSCT outcomes by conditioning regimen in paediatric patients with diseaseD000755 from the EBMT registry. In 2010-2020, 251 patients aged <18 years underwent a first matched sibling donor (MSD) HSCT with conditioning based on busulfan-fludarabine (bu-flu; n = 89) or treosulfan-fludarabine (treo-flu; n = 162). In the bu-flu and treo-flu groups, 51.7% and 99.4% of patients, respectively, received chemicalD013852. Median follow-up was 2.7 years. Two-year overall survival (OS) was 98.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 90.9-99.8) with bu-flu and 99.3% (95% CI: 95.2-99.9) with treo-flu (p = 0.63). Grade III-IV acute diseaseD006086 (diseaseD006086) at 100 days was 2.4% (95% CI: 0.4-7.5) and 0.6% (0.1%-3.2%) for bu-flu and treo-flu respectively (p = 0.25). The 2-year incidence of extensive chronic diseaseD006086 was 1.5% (95% CI: 0.1-7.3) with bu-flu and 8.0% (95% CI: 4.1-13.3) with treo-flu (p = 0.057). These multinational data confirm the excellent curative capacity of MSD HSCT with myeloablative conditioning. Both conditioning regimens yielded excellent OS, low rates of acute and chronic diseaseD006086, and low rates of graft failure.

37803527		Natural history of blood pressure in diseaseD000755 pregnancy.In this retrospective cohort study of singleton pregnancies in people with diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755) delivered at two academic centres between 1990 and 2021, we collected demographic and diseaseD000755-related data, pregnancy outcomes, and the highest systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP) at seven time periods. We compared blood pressure values and trajectories in the composite cohort and in each genotype group to control values in a non-diseaseD000755 pregnancy dataset. There were 290 pregnancies among 197 patients with diseaseD000755. Sixteen per cent (n = 47) of pregnancies had a diseaseD046110 (diseaseD046110); the rates did not differ by genotype. The mean SBP and DBP were lower in the HbSS/HbSbeta0 group than in the non-diseaseD000755 control group at all timepoints. Mean SBP and DBP trajectories were similar between the HbSS/HbSbeta0 group and non-diseaseD000755 controls, whereas the mean SBP and DBP in the HbSC/HbSbeta+ group decreased between the first and second trimesters and plateaued between the second and third trimesters. There were no differences in blood pressure trajectory by haemoglobin >/< 10 gm/dL or by chronic transfusion status. Overall, pregnant people with diseaseD000755 have lower blood pressure than unaffected pregnant people, raising the possibility that diseaseD046110 are underdiagnosed, particularly in people with HbSS/HbSbeta0 .
37973947	Association|diseaseD009369|ncbi1788; Association|diseaseD000755|ncbi2146; Association|diseaseD009369|ncbi2146	Clonal selection of hematopoietic stem cells after gene therapy for diseaseD000755.Gene therapy (GT) provides a potentially curative treatment option for patients with diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755); however, the occurrence of diseaseD009369 in GT clinical trials has prompted concern, with several postulated mechanisms. Here, we used whole-genome sequencing to track hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from six patients with diseaseD000755 at pre- and post-GT time points to map the somatic mutation and clonal landscape of gene-modified and unmodified HSCs. Pre-GT, phylogenetic trees were highly polyclonal and mutation burdens per cell were elevated in some, but not all, patients. Post-GT, no clonal expansions were identified among gene-modified or unmodified cells; however, an increased frequency of potential driver mutations associated with diseaseD009369 or clonal hematopoiesis (ncbi1788- and ncbi2146-mutated clones in particular) was observed in both genetically modified and unmodified cells, suggesting positive selection of mutant clones during GT. This work sheds light on HSC clonal dynamics and the mutational landscape after GT in diseaseD000755, highlighting the enhanced fitness of some HSCs harboring pre-existing driver mutations. Future studies should define the long-term fate of mutant clones, including any contribution to expansions associated with diseaseD009369.
38285418		diseaseD011317 in a Young Adult With diseaseD000755.This article presents a case study focusing on diseaseD011317 in a 9606 with diseaseD000755, with repeated emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations. The 9606 was successfully identified and treated by the ED nurse practitioner (NP) with aspiration of the diseaseD061085. diseaseD011317 is a persistent penile erection that continues for an extended time. There is some argument about what that length of time is, but generally, the consensus is more than 4 hr beyond sexual stimulation or unrelated to sexual stimulation or sexual interest (Bivalacqua et al., 2022). diseaseD011317 is a fairly common but underrecognized complication of diseaseD000755. It represents a urological emergency in which timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment are vital to preserving penile tissue and sexual function. The diagnosis is made clinically with a comprehensive history, physical examination, and appropriate laboratory test values. Initial management can be conservative with hydration and analgesics or, if necessary, more invasive with needle aspiration to promote detumescence. Permanent tissue damage or diseaseD007172 can result if diseaseD011317 is unrecognized, untreated, or not treated immediately. The NP plays an integral role in treating and preventing permanent damage. 9606 education should focus on instructions for preventing diseaseD011317 and managing episodes at home.
38031035	Association|diseaseD000755|ncbi1471	ncbi1471-derived estimated glomerular filtration rate in children with diseaseD000755.BACKGROUND: diseaseD000755 is the most common diseaseD025861 in humans and constitutes a major public health burden. It is a multisystemic condition with long-term diseaseD007674. Early detection of diseaseD000755 and initiation of appropriate interventions are associated with improved survival and quality of life. This study aimed to compare the ncbi1471-derived estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of the study groups and also, to correlate the clinical features of diseaseD051436 (diseaseD051436) with decreased GFR in children with diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755). METHODS: This hospital-based cross-sectional analytic study recruited 86 diseaseD000755 subjects in steady-state and 86 age and sex-matched healthy HbAA controls aged 1-14 years who attended the Paediatric Haematology and Outpatient clinics of Federal Medical Centre Bida over six months. Data were collected using a semi-structured questionnaire, and participants' length/height, weight, and blood pressure were measured using standard procedures. Blood samples were drawn for serum ncbi1471 assay via the sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique. Filler's equation was used to calculate the glomerular filtration rate. RESULTS: There was a significant difference in the mean ncbi1471-derived GFR between the two groups, i.e. 116 +- 30mL/min/1.73m2 vs. 106 +- 24mL/min/1.73m2 for the diseaseD000755 and control groups, respectively (p = 0.017). The prevalence of supernormal GFR (i.e. GFR > 140mL/min/1.73m2) and decreased GFR (i.e. GFR < 90mL/min/1.73m2) was 19.8% and 22.1%, respectively, in children with diseaseD000755. There was no significant association between the age at diagnosis of diseaseD000755, blood transfusions, blood pressure, packed cell volume and presence of diseaseD010523 with decreased GFR in the study subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Supernormal GFR is common in children with diseaseD000755 and there is no significant association between clinical features of diseaseD051436 with decreased GFR. Regular evaluation of renal function is, however, recommended in children with diseaseD000755 for early detection and treatment of diseaseD007674 in order to halt the progression to diseaseD007676 (diseaseD007676).
37865180		Multi-component Strategy Improves HPV Vaccination Rates among Adolescents with diseaseD000755.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a vaccine strategy bundle to increase HPV vaccine initiation and completion in a specialty clinic setting. STUDY DESIGN: Our Hematology clinic utilized an implementation framework from October 1, 2018, to December 31, 2019, involving nurses, nursing coordinators, and clinicians in administering the HPV vaccination series to our adolescent diseaseD000755 sample of nearly 500 patients. The bundle included education for staff on the need for HPV vaccine administration, provider incentives, vaccines offered to patients in diseaseC536778 clinics, and verification of patients' charts of vaccine completion. RESULTS: Following the implementation of the bundle, the cumulative incidence of HPV vaccination initiation and completion improved from 28% to 46% and 7% to 49%, respectively. Both rates remained higher post-implementation as well. HPV vaccination series completion was associated with a decreased distance to the healthcare facility, lower state deprivation rank, and increased hospitalizations. CONCLUSION: Our clinic's implementation strategy successfully improved vaccine completion rates among adolescents with diseaseC536778 while continuing to educate staff, patients, and families on the importance of diseaseD009369 prevention among people living with diseaseC536778.
37832631		CRISPR-based precision medicine for diseaseD006402: Advancements, challenges, and prospects.The development of programmable nucleases to introduce defined alterations in genomic sequences has been a powerful tool for precision medicine. While several nucleases such as zinc-finger nucleases (ZFN), transcriptor activator-like effector nucleases (TALEN), and meganucleases have been explored, the advent of CRISPR/Cas9 technology has revolutionized the field of genome engineering. In addition to disease modeling, the CRISPR/Cas9 technology has contributed to safer and more effective treatment strategies for diseaseD006402 and personalized T-cell-based therapies. Here we discuss the applications of the CRISPR technology in the treatment of diseaseD006402, their efficacy, and ongoing clinical trials. We examine the obstacles to their successful use and the approaches investigated to overcome these challenges. Finally, we provide our perspectives to improve this genome editing tool for targeted therapies.
38010293		Defining curative endpoints for diseaseD000755 in the era of gene therapy and gene editing.A growing number of gene therapy- and gene editing-based treatments for patients with diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755) are entering clinical trials. These treatments, designed to target the underlying cause of diseaseD000755, have the potential to provide functional cures, which until now were possible only through allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. However, as these novel approaches advance from early- to late-stage clinical trials, it is essential to identify physiologically and clinically relevant endpoints that can demonstrate the achievement of a functional cure for diseaseD000755. Here, we present an overview of the pathophysiology of diseaseD000755 and current treatment options, review ongoing diseaseD000755 clinical trials using gene therapy or gene editing approaches, and identify the most relevant endpoints for demonstrating the attainment of a functional cure for diseaseD000755.
37952647	Association|chemicalC103828|diseaseD005355	Improvement in cardiac morphology demonstrated by CMR and echo after haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplant in adults with diseaseD000755.diseaseD006323 account for approximately 40% of diseaseD003643 in patients with diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755). Diffuse diseaseD005355, elevated tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity (TRV) and diseaseD019190 are all associated with early mortality. While HLA-matched sibling hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) offers a potential cure, fewer than 20% of patients have a suitable donor. Haploidentical HCT allows for an increased donor pool and has recently demonstrated improved safety and efficacy. Our group has reported improved cardiac morphology via echocardiography at one year after HCT. Herein, we describe the first use of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR), the gold standard for measuring volume, mass, and ventricular function, to evaluate changes in cardiac morphology post-HCT in adults with diseaseD000755. We analyzed baseline and 1-year data from 12 adults with diseaseD000755 who received nonmyeloablative haploidentical peripheral blood HCT at the NIH. Patients underwent non-contrast CMR at 3T, echocardiography, and laboratory studies. One year after HCT, patients showed marked improvement in cardiac chamber morphology by CMR, including left ventricular (LV) mass and volume (70.2 to 60.1 g/m2, p = 0.02; 114.5 to 90.6 mL/m2, p = 0.001). Furthermore, mean TRV normalized by 1 year, suggesting that HCT may offer a survival benefit. Fewer patients had pathologically prolonged native myocardial chemicalC103828 times, an indirect marker of diseaseD005355 at 1 year; these data showed a trend toward significance. In this small sample, CMR was very sensitive in detecting cardiac mass and volume changes after HCT and provided complementary information to echocardiography. Notably, post-HCT improvement in cardiac parameters can be attributed only in part to the resolution of diseaseD000740; further studies are required to determine the role of diseaseD005355 reversal, improved blood flow, and survival impact after HCT for diseaseD000755.

37929626		Safety of Ultrasound Contrast Agents in Pediatric Patients With diseaseD000755 and Trait.Ultrasound contrast agent (UCA) use is increasing. Recent isolated reports observed a rise in diseaseD010146-related adverse events with the intravenous administration of the UCA Definity in adults with diseaseD000755. To date, no studies have investigated the incidence of similar adverse events with UCA Lumason or Optison. We describe our experience regarding the safety of Lumason and Optison in children with diseaseD000755 and trait who underwent contrast-enhanced ultrasound exams in our department with intravenous, intravesical, and other intracavitary routes. No diseaseD010146-related or other adverse events were observed in this pediatric population with any route of UCA administration.
38161155		Management of Acute diseaseD000755 diseaseD010146.diseaseD010146 is a common complication of diseaseD000755. diseaseD000755 can often be effectively managed by pediatricians in 9606 and hospital settings. diseaseD059787 management should be initiated quickly. 9606 need to be evaluated for diseaseD000755 and other causes of diseaseD010146. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids are the mainstay of diseaseD010146 treatment, but additional therapies include hydration, local diseaseD010146 control, muscle relaxants, and nonpharmacologic approaches. Healthy lifestyle habits and good behavioral and mental health are important for preventing and coping with diseaseD000755 diseaseD010146. Disease-modifying therapies, such as hydroxyurea, can help prevent sickle hemoglobin polymerization and diseaseD059787 episodes. Because diseaseD000755 largely affects people who are racialized minorities in the United States, health-care providers need to be aware of how their own personal biases may affect care of these 9606.
38263886		Reversal of diseaseD020943 Post-Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant for diseaseD000755.diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755) is a chronic diseaseD006402 which causes progressive diseaseD020943 beginning in childhood. As a result, arterial diseaseD002544 is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in diseaseD000755, and diseaseD000755 is a leading cause of childhood diseaseD020521 worldwide. Allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) may be curative for individuals with diseaseD000755. Long-term outcomes and effects are currently being studied. In this report, we describe a child with diseaseD000755 who presented with arterial diseaseD002544 at 6 years of age and was found to have a severe form of diseaseD059345 by catheter-directed angiography. The 9606 initially underwent revascularization surgery by indirect superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery bypass, and 1 year later, he underwent curative HSCT. Approximately 3 years after HSCT, repeat catheter-directed angiography revealed a striking reversal of diseaseD059345. This article reveals a previously unrecognized and potentially beneficial effect of HSCT that may ameliorate diseaseD059345 and improve cerebrovascular health for children with diseaseD000755.
38409146		The Evaluation of Invasive Prenatal Diagnostic Tests in North Cyprus: A Retrospective Study.BACKGROUND: diseaseD030342 are still an important medical, social, and economic problem all over the world. In North Cyprus, in addition to other reasons, early prenatal diagnostic measures are undertaken to prevent births with diseaseD017086, a locally widespread diseaseD030342. AIM: This study aims to evaluate the results of prenatal invasive diagnostic tests performed in a private obstetrics clinic in Northern Cyprus and show the diagnosis process of diseaseD013789 and diseaseD002869. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study is a retrospective, descriptive study. Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) results and the amniocentesis tests performed between 1990 and 2022 are evaluated. diseaseD013789 and chromosome analysis of samples obtained by CVS and amniocentesis tests were performed. To diagnose diseaseD017086 and diseaseD000755, 239 CVS was performed. And to diagnose diseaseD002869, 396 CVS and amniocentesis were performed. RESULTS: The mean age of the 480 pregnant 9606 included in the study was 31.12 years (18-46) and 30% of them were older than 34 years. The most common indications for invasive prenatal diagnostic test (IPDT) were; mother/father diseaseD017086, advanced maternal age, high risk of ultrasonography erase findings, and the noninvasive screening test. The result of IPDT detected 7.3% diseaseD002869 and 69.5% diseaseD013789 and diseaseD000755. Of the 239 CVS performed to diagnose diseaseC567100 and diseaseD000755, 23.4% beta major, 42.3% diseaseD017086, and 2.1% alpha minor were diagnosed. Of the 396 CVS and amniocentesis performed to diagnose diseaseD025063; 2.8% of diseaseD004314 and 4.54% of other diseaseD002869 were diagnosed. CONCLUSION: IPDT is important in correctly diagnosing diseaseD000013 at the prenatal stage to help families decide at the right time.

ALIGN aimed to embed Individualized diseaseD010146 Plans in the electronic health record (E-IPP) and provide access to the plan for both adult patients with diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755) and emergency department providers when a person with diseaseD000755 comes to the emergency department in diseaseD013224. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with research teams from the 8 participating sites from the ALIGN study. Seventeen participants (principal investigators and study coordinators) shared their perspectives about the implementation of ALIGN in their sites. Data were analyzed in three phases using open coding steps adapted from grounded theory and qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: A total of seven overarching themes were identified: (1) the E-IPP structure (location and upkeep) and collaboration with the informatics team, (2) the role of ED champion, (3) the role of research coordinators, (4) research team communication, and communication between research team and clinical team, (5) challenges with the study protocol, (6) provider feedback: addressing over-utilizers, patient mistrust, and the positive feedback about the intervention, and (7) diseaseD000086382 and its effects on study implementation. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study contribute to learning how to implement E-IPPs for adult patients with diseaseD000755 in ED. The study findings highlight the importance of early engagement with different team members, a champion from the emergency department, study coordinators with different skills and enhancement of communication and trust among team members. Further recommendations are outlined for hospitals aiming to implement E-IPP for patients with diseaseD000755 in ED.
38050205		diseaseD003428 in diseaseD000755 patients: Prevention through multi-disciplinary approach: A review.diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755), a diseaseD025861 characterized by the presence of abnormal hemoglobin, poses a unique set of challenges for both patients and healthcare providers. One of the most pressing issues in the care of these individuals is the persistent threat of diseaseD003428, which are diseaseD007239 acquired during hospitalization. This abstract provides a concise overview of the ongoing challenge of diseaseD003428 in diseaseD000755 patients, highlighting the factors contributing to their vulnerability and the preventive measures in place. diseaseD000755 patients face increased susceptibility to diseaseD003428 due to their compromised immune systems, frequent hospitalizations, prolonged stays, and the need for invasive medical interventions. The emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens further complicates the management of these diseaseD007239. To address this challenge, healthcare facilities have implemented diseaseD007239 control protocols, vaccination strategies, and antimicrobial stewardship, emphasizing the importance of patient education. Recognizing the gravity of this issue and adopting comprehensive preventive measures is crucial to improving the quality of care and patient outcomes in this vulnerable population. Further research and ongoing efforts are essential to reducing the burden of diseaseD003428 in diseaseD000755 patients and enhancing their overall healthcare experience.
37933708		Impact of a hospital service for adults with chronic childhood-onset disease: A propensity weighted analysis.BACKGROUND: Young adults with diseaseD002908 (diseaseD002908) transitioning care from pediatrics to adult care are at high risk for readmission after hospital discharge. At our institution, we have implemented an inpatient service, the Med-Peds (MP) line, to improve transitions to adult care and reduce hospital utilization by young adults with diseaseD002908. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the effect of the MP line on length of stay (LOS) and 30-day readmission rates compared to other inpatient services. METHODS: This was an observational, retrospective cohort analysis of patients admitted to the MP line compared to other hospital service lines over a 2-year period. To avoid potential confounding by indication for admission to the MP line, propensity score weighting methods were used. RESULTS: The MP line cared for 302 patients with diseaseD002908 from June 2019 to July 2021. Compared to other service lines, there was a 33% reduction in relative risk of 30-day readmission (26.9% compared to 40.3%, risk ratio = 0.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.55-0.81). LOS was 10% longer for the MP line (event time ratio (ETR): 1.10 95% CI 1.0-1.21) with median LOS 4.8 versus 4.5 days. Patients with diseaseD000755 had less of a reduction in 30-day readmissions and longer LOS. CONCLUSION: Hospitalization for young adults with diseaseD002908 on a MP service line was associated with lower 30-day readmission rates and longer LOS than hospitalization on other services. Further research is needed to assess which components of the line most contribute to decreased utilization.
38066927		Gene therapy for diseaseD000755.diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755) is potentially curable after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or autologous HSCT after ex vivo genetic modification. Autologous HSCT with gene therapy has the potential to overcome many of the limitations of allogeneic HSCT that include the lack of suitable donors, diseaseD006086, the need for immune suppression, and the potential for graft rejection. Significant progress in gene therapy for diseaseD000755 has been made over the past several decades, now with a growing number of clinical trials investigating various gene addition and gene editing strategies. Available results from a small number of 9606, some with relatively short follow-up, are promising as a potentially curative strategy, with current efforts focused on continuing to improve the efficacy, durability, and safety of gene therapies for the cure of diseaseD000755.
37933199		Imaging of pediatric diseaseD012888: A review.diseaseD012888 in pediatric population are common findings on imaging and sometimes with heterogeneous manifestations, constituting a diagnostic challenge. Some diseaseD009059 can be misinterpreted for their aggressiveness, as with larger diseaseD009059 eroding cortical bone, containing soft tissue components, leading to excessive and, in some cases, invasive inappropriate etiological investigation. In this review, we present multiple several conditions that may present as diseaseD012888 or pseudolesions, organized by groups (anatomic variants, diseaseD002658, diseaseD014947, vascular issues, infectious conditions, and diseaseD009369 processes). Anatomic variants are common imaging findings that must be recognized by the neuroradiologist. disease163000 are rare conditions, such as diseaseD004476 and diseaseD020779, usually seen at earlier ages, the majority of which are benign findings. In case of diseaseD014947, cephalohematoma, growing diseaseD012887, and diseaseD013313 should be considered. diseaseD010019 tends to be locally aggressive and may mimic diseaseD009369, in which cases, the clinical history can be the key to diagnosis. Vascular (diseaseD000755) and diseaseD009369 (diseaseD001845, diseaseD004803, diseaseD009362) diseaseD009059 are relatively rare diseaseD009059 but should be considered in the differential diagnosis, in the presence of certain imaging findings. The main difficulty is the differentiation between the benign and malignant nature; therefore, the main objective of this pictorial essay is to review the main diseaseD012888 found in pediatric age, describing the main findings in different imaging modalities (CT and MRI), allowing the neuroradiologist greater confidence in establishing the differential diagnosis, through a systematic and simple characterization of the diseaseD009059.
37855191		Right diseaseD013927 removal with use of the ONO retrieval device.diseaseC538262 and specifically diseaseD059446 can be difficult to manage and carry a high mortality rate. Typically, surgical removal or mechanical thrombectomy can be performed though may not be suitable for all patients. We present a unique case of a diseaseD000755 patient with a large pedunculated right diseaseD013927 that was successfully extracted using the novel ONO Retrieval Device.
38130071		Reevaluation of the medical necessity of washed red blood cell transfusion in chronically transfused adults.BACKGROUND: Washing red blood cell (RBC) units mitigates severe diseaseD065227. However, washing reduces the time to expiration and the effective dose. Automated washing is time- and labor-intensive. A shortage of cell processor tubing sets prompted review of medical necessity for washed RBC for 9606 previously thought to require washing. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A single-center, retrospective study investigated discontinuing wash RBC protocols in chronically transfused adults. In select 9606 with prior requirements for washing, due to a history of diseaseD065227, trials of unwashed transfusions were performed. 9606 demographic, clinical, laboratory, and transfusion data were compiled. The per-unit washing cost was the sum of the tubing set, saline, and technical labor costs. RESULTS: Fifteen 9606 (median age 34 years interquartile range [IQR] 23-53 years, 46.7% female) were evaluated. These 9606 had been transfused with a median of 531 washed RBC units (IQR 244-1066) per 9606 over 12 years (IQR 5-18 years), most commonly for recurrent, non-severe allergic reactions. There were no transfusion reactions with unwashed RBCs aside from one 9606 with one episode of diseaseD011537 and another with recurrent diseaseD011537, which was typical even with washed RBC. We decreased the mean number of washed RBC units per month by 72.9% (104   10 vs. 28.2   25.2; p < .0001) and saved US $100.25 per RBC unit. CONCLUSION: Washing of RBCs may be safely reconsidered in chronically transfused 9606 without a history of diseaseD000707. Washing should be implemented judiciously due to potential lack of necessity and logistical/operational challenges.
38204310		Newborn screening for diseaseD000755 in Antalya, Turkiye.BACKGROUND: In a screening study conducted on adults, the prevalence of diseaseD000755 traits in Antalya was found to be 0.24%. Since no screening studies have been conducted in the neonatal period in our region, the exact incidence has not been determined. In this study, we aim to report our experience of neonatal screening for diseaseD000755 in Antalya, Turkiye. METHODS: During a 14-month period, 2562 heel prick blood samples, taken on filter paper from Akdeniz University Hospital, Antalya Education and Research Hospital and Antalya Ataturk State Hospital and four other healthcare centers, were studied using the high pressure liquid chromatography method. Blood samples were studied using the `diseaseD000755 Short Program` test method on a Bio Rad Variant device. RESULTS: In the study, no 9606 with diseaseD000755 were identified. Four newborns who were diseaseD000755 carriers (0.15%) and two newborns who were Hemoglobin D carriers (0.08 %), were found. CONCLUSION: Considering the efficiency and cost calculations made as a result of the data obtained from our study, it was concluded that diseaseD000755 screening would not be effective in newborns. It seems more effective and economical to screen the children of parents, who are found to be at risk for Hemoglobin S carriage as a result of premarital tests.
37914454		"SCULP" study: The benefits of skin graft pellets on the diseaseD010146 of diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755).BACKGROUND: diseaseD007871 associated with major diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755) are a chronic, painful complication, often treated by autologous skin graft. The analgesic effect of skin grafting in diseaseD000755 is poorly studied. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of skin grafting on the diseaseD010146 and healing of diseaseD000755. METHODS: Patients hospitalized for diseaseD000755 skin grafting were included in a retrospective and prospective observational cohort, between 2019 and 2023: 53 autologous pinch grafts were performed on a total of 35 SCLUs in 25 diseaseD000755 patients. The primary endpoint was the evaluation of the analgesic effect of the skin graft, measured by visual analog scale (VAS) and weekly cumulative analgesic consumption between day (D)0, D7 and D30. Wound healing was assessed by variation in wound areas between D0 and D30. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients with a median age range of 45.5years old were included, 68% were men, SS genotype was present in 96% of the cases. At D7, a significant decrease in VAS and consumption of analgesics of all classes was observed. At D30, only a significant decrease in VAS and consumption of mild opioids was present, as well as a significant reduction in wound surface area compared with D0. CONCLUSION: Pinch grafts have a significant early analgesic effect in the management of patients with diseaseD000755, and significantly notice reduction of wound surface area within one month.

This study investigates GLOBE-based lentiviral vectors (LVs) for b<sup>ncbi23047</sup>-globin addition and evaluates strategies for an increased b-like globin expression without vector dose escalation. First, we report the development of a GLOBE-derived LV, A628-C6V6, which, compared to its parental vector, adds anti-sickling action and a transcription-enhancing 848-bp transcription terminator element, retains high vector titers and allows for superior b-like globin expression in primary 9606-derived hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Second, prompted by our previous correction of <i>ncbi3043<sup>IVSIvariant#3043#c.-110G>A</sup></i> diseaseD013789 based on RNApol(III)-driven shRNAs in mono- and combination therapy, we analyzed a series of novel LVs for the RNApol(II)-driven constitutive or late-erythroid expression of <i>ncbi3043<sup>IVSIvariant#3043#c.-110G>A</sup></i>-specific miRNA30-embedded shRNAs (shRNAmiR). This included bifunctional LVs, allowing for concurrent b<sup>ncbi23047</sup>-globin expression. LVs were initially compared for their ability to achieve high b-like globin expression in <i>ncbi3043<sup>IVSIvariant#3043#c.-110G>A</sup></i>-transgenic cells, before the evaluation of shortlisted candidate LVs in <i>ncbi3043<sup>IVSIvariant#3043#c.-110G>A</sup></i>-homozygous HSPCs. The latter revealed that b-globin promoter-driven designs for monotherapy with <i>ncbi3043<sup>IVSIvariant#3043#c.-110G>A</sup></i>-specific shRNAmiRs only marginally increased b-globin levels compared to untransduced cells, whereas bifunctional LVs combining miR30-shRNA with b<sup>ncbi23047</sup>-globin expression showed disease correction similar to that achieved by the parental A628-C6V6 vector. Our results establish the feasibility of high titers for LVs containing the full <i>ncbi3043</i> transcription terminator, emphasize the importance of the <i>ncbi3043</i> terminator for the high-level expression of <i>ncbi3043</i>-like transgenes, qualify the therapeutic utility of late-erythroid <i>ncbi3043<sup>IVSIvariant#3043#c.-110G>A</sup></i>-specific miR30-shRNA expression and highlight the exceptional potential of A628-C6V6 for the treatment of severe diseaseD006453.
38066894		The range of haploidentical transplant protocols in diseaseD000755: all haplos are not created equally.The ideal curative therapy for diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755) must be applicable across all ages and include individuals with diseaseD020521 and preexisting diseaseD007674. Myeloablative, matched sibling donor hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) for children with diseaseD000755 has shown excellent outcomes over the past 3 decades but has been restricted due to the limited availability of a 9606 leukocyte antigen-matched sibling donor (10%-15%) and increased treatment-related diseaseD003643 in adults with myeloablative conditioning. To overcome these 2 significant barriers to curative therapy in diseaseD000755, related haploidentical HCT has become an active area of research. The use of related haploidentical donors (first- and second-degree relatives) increases the donor pool to at least 90% of those eligible across the life span. Importantly, most adults, even with diseaseD020521 or significant comorbidities, can tolerate the nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen without treatment-related diseaseD003643. Since 2013, at least 3 related haploidentical HCT strategies have emerged as potential curative therapies for diseaseD000755: (1) a nonmyeloablative, T-cell replete, bone marrow transplant with thiotepa and posttransplant cyclophosphamide with a goal of complete donor chimerism; (2) a nonmyeloablative, in vivo T-cell depletion, using peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) with a goal of stable mixed donor-recipient chimerism; and (3) a myeloablative, ex vivo T-cell depletion using PBSCs and advanced-technology graft manipulation, with a goal of complete donor chimerism. We review the similarities, differences, outcomes, and gaps in knowledge with these 3 haploidentical HCT approaches for diseaseD000755.
38069808		High hydroxyurea usage in diseaseD000755 regardless of 9606 demographics.Hydroxyurea is highly effective in diseaseD000755, but it is still underutilized. Reports of hydroxyurea utilization largely use Medicaid data, and socioeconomics is often cited as a barrier. To address whether 9606 demographics influenced the high hydroxyurea usage rate recently reported for the pediatric diseaseD000755 cell program of Northern Virginia, analysis of data from 2011 to 2021 revealed no statistical difference in hydroxyurea usage rate between Medicaid and non-Medicaid, African American and African, or age less than 13 and age greater than or equal to 13 years cohorts, demonstrating that hydroxyurea can be successfully implemented across demographic groups.
37905989		Preferences for potential benefits and risks for gene therapy in the treatment of diseaseD000755.Objective is to quantify benefit-risk tradeoffs pertaining to potential gene therapies among adults and parents/caregivers of children with diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755). A discrete-choice experiment (DCE) survey was developed in which respondents selected their preferred treatment alternatives in a series of experimentally-controlled pairs of hypothetical gene therapies and a "no gene therapy" option. Gene therapy alternatives were defined based on the chance of eliminating diseaseD000755 symptoms, expected increases in life expectancy they could offer, treatment-related risk of diseaseD003643 and potential increases in lifetime diseaseD009369 risk. Respondents made selections based on their current disease severity and in the context of expectations of worsened disease. Three clinical sites and one patient organization recruited 174 adult patients and 109 parents of children with diseaseD000755 to complete the survey. Adult and parent respondents were generally willing to choose gene therapies, but the adults required higher expected levels of efficacy (i.e., higher chance of eliminating symptoms) than parents to choose gene therapies that conferred mortality risks of 10% or more. When adults and parents of children with less severe symptoms were asked to consider scenarios of higher levels of disease severity, the risk tolerance increased, and the lowest acceptable level of efficacy for gene therapies with mortality risks dropped by more than 50%. Baseline diseaseD000755 symptoms are a major driver of gene therapy acceptability. Adults and parents of patients with milder symptoms may prefer other treatment options; however, an expectation of symptoms deterioration triggers strong reassessment of the acceptable benefit-risk balance of this novel technology.
37803115	Association|diseaseD000755|ncbi3565; Association|diseaseD000755|ncbi3596	New Insights into Clinical Management for diseaseD000755: Uncovering the Significant Pathways Affected by the Involvement of diseaseD000755.One of the severe monogenic conditions with the highest prevalence in the globe is diseaseD000755. Although the significance of chronic diseaseD000740, diseaseD006461, and diseaseD000090122 has been established, hemoglobin polymerization, which results in erythrocyte stiffness and diseaseD001157, is important to the pathophysiology of this disease. Clinical management is elementary, and there is scant reliable data for many treatments. The onset of diseaseD002561 and diseaseD003072 are two of the major issues associated with diseaseD000755 in children, and it is only now that researchers are beginning to understand how blood transfusions and chemicalD006918 can prevent these complications. When diseaseD001157 and diseaseD007249 occur repeatedly, the majority of organs are gradually damaged, including the brain, kidneys, lungs, bones, and cardiovascular system. This damage worsens with age. In our study, we focused on the specific pathways which are affected by the involvement of effected genes. Firstly, we retrieved the gene datasets from the publically available data source website DisGNET. Using literature-based genes, we identified 290 highly regulated genes that are directly associated with diseaseD000755. We subsequently performed a gene expression analysis and extracted a gene set using GEO2R analysis, which was then used to prune 290 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). After pruning we got 60 highly expressed genes. After identification of DEGs, we used these genes for pathway analysis. For the pathway analysis, we used Reactome software and we found that these DEGs are directly associated with 7 different pathways, which are ncbi351 signaling pathways, 15 antiviral mechanism, Oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) antiviral response, ncbi3552 signaling pathways, ncbi3565, ncbi3586 signaling pathway, and chemicalD001241 ADME pathway. After pathway analysis, we can exactly relate how diseaseD000755 alters the gene expression and how these genes affect the different pathways. Additionally, we performed gene ontology of 60 genes and identified the gene biological process, cellular component, and molecular functions as we mentioned in our results. With the help of our study data, there is a chance for pre-identification of diseaseD000755 person. Our gene result was used as a biomarker of diseaseD000755. In this paper, our result is the primary approach for diseaseD000755; with the help of this paper any researcher can get their primary data and use that for further research.
37919142		Haematopoietic stem cell health in diseaseD000755 and its implications for stem cell therapies and secondary diseaseD006402.Gene modification of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is a potentially curative approach to diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755) and offers hope for patients who are not eligible for allogeneic HSC transplantation. Current approaches require in vitro manipulation of healthy autologous HSC prior to their transplantation. However, the health and integrity of HSCs may be compromised by a variety of disease processes in diseaseD000755, and challenges have emerged in the clinical trials of gene therapy. There is also concern about increased susceptibility to diseaseD009369 during long-term follow up of patients, and this raises questions about genomic stability in the stem cell compartment. In this review, we evaluate the evidence for diseaseD009461 in diseaseD000755 and then discuss their potential causation. Finally, we suggest several questions which need to be addressed in order to progress with successful HSC manipulation for gene therapy in diseaseD000755.

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is currently the only curative treatment for patients with diseaseD000755. Whereas normalization of hemoglobin levels and diseaseD006461 markers has been reported after HSCT, its effects on cerebral perfusion and oxygenation in adult diseaseD000755 patients remain largely unexplored. This study investigated the effects of HSCT on cerebral blood flow (CBF), chemicalD010100 delivery, cerebrovascular reserve (CVR), chemicalD010100 extraction fraction (OEF), and cerebral metabolic rate of chemicalD010100 (CMRO2 ) in 17 adult diseaseD000755 patients (mean age: 25.0 +- 8.0, 6 females) before and after HSCT and 10 healthy ethnicity-matched controls (mean age: 28.0 +- 8.8, 6 females) using MRI. For the CVR assessment, perfusion scans were performed before and after chemicalD000086 as a vasodilatory stimulus. Following HSCT, gray and white matter (GM and WM) CBF decreased (p < .01), while GM and WM CVR increased (p < .01) compared with the baseline measures. OEF and CMRO2 also increased towards levels in healthy controls (p < .01). The normalization of cerebral perfusion and chemicalD010100 metabolism corresponded with a significant increase in hemoglobin levels and decreases in reticulocytes, total chemicalD001663, and LDH as markers of diseaseD006461 (p < .01). This study shows that HSCT results in the normalization of cerebral perfusion and chemicalD010100 metabolism, even in adult patients with diseaseD000755. Future follow-up MRI scans will determine whether the observed normalization of cerebral hemodynamics and chemicalD010100 metabolism prevents new silent diseaseD002544.
38237001		Perspectives of Adolescents and Young Adults With diseaseD000755 and Clinicians on Improving Transition Readiness With a Video Game Intervention.We aimed to learn the experiences of clinicians and adolescents and young adults with diseaseD000755 (AYA-diseaseC536778) with managing their disease at home and making medical decisions as they transition from pediatric to adult care, and their perceptions of a video game intervention to positively impact these skills. We conducted individual, semistructured interviews with 9606 (AYA-diseaseC536778 ages 15 to 26 years) and clinicians who provide care to AYA-diseaseC536778 at an urban, quaternary-care hospital. Interviews elicited 9606' and clinicians' experiences with AYA-diseaseC536778, barriers and facilitators to successful home management, and their perspectives on shared decision-making and a video game intervention. To identify themes, we conducted an inductive analysis until data saturation was reached. Participants (16 9606 and 21 clinicians) identified 4 main themes: (1) self-efficacy as a critical skill for a successful transition from pediatric to adult care, (2) the importance of 9606 engagement in making medical decisions, (3) multilevel determinants of optimal self-efficacy and 9606 engagement, and (4) support for a video game intervention which, by targeting potential determinants of AYA-diseaseC536778 achieving optimal self-efficacy and engagement in decision-making, may improve these important skills.
37800996		Outcomes and long-term effects of hematopoietic stem cell transplant in diseaseD000755.INTRODUCTION: Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is the only readily available curative option for diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755). Cure rates following human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched related donor HSCT with myeloablative or non-myeloablative conditioning are > 90%. Alternative donor sources, including haploidentical donor and autologous with gene therapy, expand donor options but are limited by inferior outcomes, limited data, and/or shorter follow-up and therefore remain experimental. AREAS COVERED: Outcomes are improving with time, with donor type and conditioning regimens having the greatest impact on long-term complications. Patients with stable donor engraftment do not experience diseaseD000755-related symptoms and have stabilization or improvement of end-organ pathology; however, the long-term effects of curative strategies remain to be fully established and have significant implications in a patient's decision to seek therapy. This review covers currently published literature on HSCT outcomes, including organ-specific outcomes implicated in diseaseD000755, as well as long-term effects. EXPERT OPINION: HSCT, both allogeneic and autologous gene therapy, in the diseaseD000755 population reverses the diseaseD000755 phenotype, prevents further organ diseaseD020263, can resolve prior diseaseD009102 in both pediatric and adult patients. Data support greater success with HSCT at a younger age, thus, curative therapies should be discussed early in the patient's life.
37951090	Positive_Correlation|chemicalD002118|diseaseD000755	chemicalD002118 flux alterations in erythrocytes from diseaseD000755 cell mice: The relevance of mean corpuscular volume.Red blood cells (RBC) from patients with diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755) have elevated chemicalD002118 levels at baseline, which are further elevated upon deoxygenation. Here we examined baseline chemicalD002118 levels and chemicalD002118 flux in RBCs from a mouse model of diseaseD000755 mice. We found that akin to humans with diseaseD000755, diseaseD000755 (HbSS) Townes mice, have higher baseline levels and increased chemicalD002118 flux in RBCs compared to control (HbAA) animals. As HbSS mice, unlike humans with diseaseD000755, have high mean corpuscular volume compared with HbAA, we highlight the importance of adjusting biochemical results to number of RBCs rather than hematocrit during the analysis and interpretation of the results. Our findings add to the face validity of humanized diseaseD000755 cell mice and support its use for studies of RBC chemicalD002118 flux in diseaseD000755.
38066905		Using disease-modifying therapies in diseaseD000755.As curative therapy using allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation as well as gene therapy and gene editing remains inaccessible to most 9606 with diseaseD000755, the availability of drug therapies that are safe, efficacious, and affordable is highly desirable. Increasing progress is being made in developing drug therapies based on our understanding of disease pathophysiology. Four drugs, hydroxyurea, L-glutamine, crizanlizumab, and voxelotor, are currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, with multiple others at various stages of testing. With the limited efficacy of individual agents, combinations of agents will likely be required for optimal outcomes.
37981193	Association|chemicalD014508|diseaseD017093	The liver in diseaseD000755.diseaseD017093 in diseaseC536778 patients is frequent but often misdiagnosed or underestimated, except in case of advanced diseaseD008107. Because of so far poorly recognized forms of chronic diseaseC536778-related diseaseD057772 that can silently evolved towards end stages or facilitate diseaseD065290, any persisting liver function tests abnormalities should be carefully investigated, following the above proposed algorithm. Work up and management must be considered multidisciplinary in relationship with a Hepatologist. Early diseaseC536778 should prompt revision of diseaseC536778 management to prevent further diseaseD017093 and decompensation, discussing transfusion exchanges and hydro chemicalD014508 when not yet initiated, and control for any cofactor of diseaseD017093. The role of HSCT in early diseaseC536778 also deserves evaluation. In advanced diseaseC536778, liver transplantation, which has been rarely performed so far, is the only therapeutic option associated with improved survival. It should definitely be discussed- either electively in case of decompensation in diseaseC536778 or diseaseD007565/recurrent diseaseD002761 in diseaseD002779, with excellent outcome, - or emergently in case of ALF or diseaseD065290 with more mitigate results. To improve knowledge and management of diseaseC536778, creation of national and international registries, as well as longitudinal observational cohorts are encouraged.
38296295		Protocol for an evaluation of the initiation of an integrated longitudinal 9606 care model for severe chronic diseaseD000073296 (PEN-Plus) at secondary care facilities (district hospitals) in 10 lower-income countries.INTRODUCTION: The Package of Essential Noncommunicable diseaseD004194 Interventions-Plus (PEN-Plus) is a strategy decentralising care for severe diseaseD000073296 (diseaseD000073296) including diseaseD003922, diseaseD012214 and diseaseD000755, to increase access to care. In the PEN-Plus model, mid-level clinicians in intermediary facilities in low and lower middle income countries are trained to provide integrated care for conditions where services traditionally were only available at tertiary referral facilities. For the upcoming phase of activities, 18 first-level hospitals in 9 countries and 1 state in India were selected for PEN-Plus expansion and will treat a variety of severe diseaseD000073296. Over 3 years, the countries and state are expected to: (1) establish PEN-Plus clinics in one or two district hospitals, (2) support these clinics to mature into training sites in preparation for national or state-level scale-up, and (3) work with the national or state-level stakeholders to describe, measure and advocate for PEN-Plus to support development of a national operational plan for scale-up. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Guided by Proctor outcomes for implementation research, we are conducting a mixed-method evaluation consisting of 10 components to understand outcomes in clinical implementation, training and policy development. Data will be collected through a mix of quantitative surveys, routine reporting, routine clinical data and qualitative interviews. diseaseD009103: This protocol has been considered exempt or covered by central and local institutional review boards. Findings will be disseminated throughout the project's course, including through quarterly M&E discussions, semiannual formative assessments, dashboard mapping of progress, quarterly newsletters, regular feedback loops with national stakeholders and publication in peer-reviewed journals.
38262104		Effect of voxelotor on 10090 bone marrow and peripheral blood with hematopoietic progenitor cell mobilization for gene therapy of diseaseD000755.In preparation for hematopoietic stem cell mobilization and collection, current ex vivo gene therapy protocols for diseaseD000755 require 9606 to undergo several months of chronic red cell transfusion. For health care equity, alternatives to red cell transfusion should be available. We examined whether treatment with GBT1118, the 10090 analog of voxelotor, could be a safe and feasible alternative to red cell transfusion. We found that 3 weeks of treatment with GBT1118 increased the percentage of bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells and upon plerixafor mobilization, the percentage of peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cells. Our data suggest that voxelotor should be further explored for its potential safety and utility as preparation for hematopoietic stem cell mobilization and collection.

SUMMARY: Early renal manifestations include diseaseD007511 with loss of urine concentrating ability and hyperfiltration. This can be followed by progressive damage characterized by persistent diseaseD000419 and a decline in the estimated glomerular filtration rate. The risk of diseaseD000755 is greater in those with the ncbi8542 G1 and G2 kidney risk variants and variants in ncbi3162 and lower in those that co-inherit diseaseD017085. Therapies to treat diseaseD000755-related diseaseD007674 focus on diseaseD000755 modifying therapies (e.g. chemicalD006918) or those adopted from the non-diseaseD000755 kidney literature (e.g. ncbi5972-angiotensin-chemicalD000450 system inhibitors), although data on their clinical efficacy are limited to small studies with short follow up periods. Kidney transplantation for diseaseD007676 improves survival compared to hemodialysis but is underutilized in this patient population. KEY MESSAGES: diseaseD007674 is a major contributor to early mortality and more research is needed to understand the pathophysiology and to develop targeted therapies to improve kidney health in diseaseD000755.
38113268		Barriers to 10566 Vaccination for 9606 With diseaseD000755 and Childhood diseaseD009369 Survivors: Comment.
38066847		Managing pregnancy in 9606 with diseaseD000755 from a transfusion perspective.Advances in the management of diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755) have made it possible for most female 9606 (whether homozygous or compound heterozygous) to reach childbearing age and become pregnant. However, even in the less symptomatic forms of diseaseD000755 a high risk of complications during pregnancy and the postpartum period can occur for both the mother (1% to 2% mortality) and the fetus. Coordinated care from the obstetrician and the diseaseD000755 expert is essential, together with the active participation of the 9606. diseaseD001157, such as diseaseD001157 and diseaseD056586, often increase in frequency when hydroxyurea treatment is interrupted. diseaseD007744, such as diseaseD011225, diseaseD005317, and diseaseD047928, are more common in 9606 with diseaseD000755. Recent meta-analysis-based studies support prophylactic transfusion. However, there have been no randomized trials assessing the benefits of prophylactic transfusion. Given the known risk of transfusion complications, including delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction and hyperhemolysis, transfusion is not systematically performed in pregnant 9606 with diseaseD000755. We describe here a case-by-case approach to the management of pregnancy in 9606 with diseaseD000755 based on the medical and transfusion history of each 9606.
37920880	Association|chemicalD001639|diseaseD058186	diseaseD058186 is more common in hospitalised children with diseaseD000755 in Africa.AIM: To document the prevalence, severity, hospital outcome and factors associated with diseaseD058186 (diseaseD058186) in hospitalised children with diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755). METHODS: In this prospective observational study involving children aged 0.5-17 years with diseaseD000755 requiring hospitalisation, we used serum chemicalD003404 level at 0 and 48 h of hospitalisation to determine the presence of diseaseD058186. RESULTS: The study involved 155 children with diseaseD000755 aged 0.5-17 years with a median (interquartile range) age of 7.8 (4.3-11.0) years. diseaseD058186 occurred in 27 (17.4%) children with 33.3% reaching stage 3. diseaseD006529 (81.5% vs. 55.4%; p = 0.015), diseaseD013163 (33.3% vs. 10.9%; p = 0.003), dipstick diseaseD011507 (22.2% vs. 5.4%; p = 0.004), and diseaseD006417 (29.6% vs. 3.1%; p = <0.001) were more common in those with diseaseD058186. In contrast, children with diseaseD058186 had lower haematocrit (16.9% vs. 22.2%; p = <0.001) and serum chemicalD001639 (16.7 vs. 19.1 mmoL/L; p = 0.010) compared with those without diseaseD058186. Those with diseaseD058186 had longer hospital stay (median [interquartile range]: 7 [4-12] days vs. 4 [3-6] days; p = 0.008). CONCLUSION: diseaseD058186 is common among hospitalised children with diseaseD058186 and is associated with longer hospital stay.

Compared to calcineurin inhibitors, chemicalD020123 has no diseaseD020258 or nephrotoxicity, but chemicalD020123 causes dose-dependent diseaseD013921, diseaseD007970, delayed wound healing, diseaseD006949, and diseaseD015228. Here we report a case of diseaseD010195 and diseaseD016883 in a patient with diseaseD000755 post haploidentical family donor HSCT which was managed conservatively without plasmapheresis. Based on our review of the literature, this is the first reported case of developing diseaseD010195 as an adverse effect of chemicalD020123-induced diseaseD015228 leading to diseaseD016883 in a recipient of HSCT.
38069073		Drug Selection and Posology, Optimal Therapies and Risk/Benefit Assessment in Medicine: The Paradigm of Iron-Chelating Drugs.The design of clinical protocols and the selection of drugs with appropriate posology are critical parameters for therapeutic outcomes. Optimal therapeutic protocols could ideally be designed in all diseases including for millions of 9606 affected by diseaseD019190 (diseaseD019190) diseaseD064420 based on personalised medicine parameters, as well as many variations and limitations. diseaseD019190 is an adverse prognostic factor for all diseases and especially for millions of chronically red-blood-cell-transfused 9606. Differences in iron chelation therapy posology cause disappointing results in diseaseD019636 at low doses, but lifesaving outcomes in diseaseD017086 (diseaseD017086) when using higher doses. In particular, the transformation of diseaseD017086 from a fatal to a chronic disease has been achieved using effective doses of oral deferiprone (L1), which improved compliance and cleared excess toxic iron from the heart associated with increased mortality in diseaseD017086. Furthermore, effective L1 and L1/deferoxamine combination posology resulted in the complete elimination of diseaseD019190 and the maintenance of normal iron store levels in diseaseD017086. The selection of effective chelation protocols has been monitored by MRI T2* diagnosis for diseaseD019190 levels in different organs. Millions of other iron-loaded 9606 with diseaseD000755, diseaseD009436 and haemopoietic stem cell transplantation, or non-iron-loaded categories with diseaseD019190 in different organs could also benefit from such chelation therapy advances. Drawbacks of chelation therapy include drug diseaseD064420 in some 9606 and also the wide use of suboptimal chelation protocols, resulting in ineffective therapies. Drug metabolic effects, and interactions with other metals, drugs and dietary molecules also affected iron chelation therapy. Drug selection and the identification of effective or optimal dose protocols are essential for positive therapeutic outcomes in the use of chelating drugs in diseaseD017086 and other iron-loaded and non-iron-loaded conditions, as well as general diseaseD000090463.
38049241		Les anemies aigues et la strategie transfusionnelle chez les drepanocytaires adultes: Acute diseaseD000740 transfusion strategy in adult diseaseD000755 patients.Worsening of diseaseD000740 is very common in diseaseD000755. It is important to investigate specific complications related to diseaseD000755 but also other causes of diseaseD000740 in general. Transfusions or exchange transfusions are major therapeutic options and are frequently used for acute complications of diseaseD000755 but also for primary and secondary prevention of some of the chronic complications. The transfusion strategy has been modified since the awareness of post-transfusion diseaseD006461 by taking into account the transfusion risk score. A strong collaboration between the patient's expert center, the Blood center and the patient's hospitalization unit is required to make decisions.   2023 Societe nationale francaise de medecine interne (SNFMI).

38000347		Generation of two isogenic diseaseD000755 induced pluripotent stem cell lines from testicular fibroblasts.Curative bone marrow transplantation (BMT) therapies for diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755) can cause diseaseD007246. The Fertility Preservation Program (FPP) in Pittsburgh cryopreserves testicular tissues for diseaseD000755 patients prior to BMT in anticipation that those tissues can be thawed in the future and matured to produce sperm. Here, we generated and validated two isogenic patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from testicular biopsy fibroblasts of a 12-year-old diseaseD000755 patient.
38167227		Successful Conservative Therapy for diseaseD007239 Penile Implants: A Case Series.BACKGROUND Traditionally, diseaseD010409 have been treated by removal followed by immediate or delayed replacement. The use of antibiotics in conservative therapy has recently attracted attention. CASE REPORT We report our experience with 4 cases of diseaseD007239 penile implants managed conservatively. Case 1 was a 41-year-old with diseaseD000755 who presented with low-grade diseaseD005334 and diseaseD019522 that started 1 month postoperatively and lasted for 3 weeks. He had left graft after fibrotic tissue excision with 14-mm collection in the left corpus cavernosum. He was managed with IV pipracillin/tazobactam and vancomycin for 13 days. Follow-up after 23 weeks showed complete wound healing. Case 2 was a 62-year-old with diseaseD003920 who had diseaseD019522 that started 41 days postoperatively and lasted for 1 week. He received 5 days of IV vancomycin and gentamycin. Follow-up after 4 weeks showed marked improvement of the wound. Case 3 was a 61-year-old with diseaseD003920 and diseaseD017202. He presented 30 days postoperatively with diseaseD005334, diseaseD019522 for 5 days. He received a total of 10 days of IV vancomycin and gentamycin. Follow-up 3 weeks after discharge showed complete wound healing. Case 4 was a 61-year-old with diseaseD003920 and diseaseD017202. He presented 1 month postoperatively with diseaseD005334 and diseaseD013492 for 1 week. He completed 10 days of IV vancomycin and gentamycin. Follow-up after 1 week showed marked wound healing. CONCLUSIONS Choosing 9606 with early superficial diseaseD007239 penile prosthesis for conservative management should be tailored to selected 9606 who does not have diseaseD007964, signs of diseaseD018805, high-grade diseaseD005334, or an exposed device.
38422317		Transfusion of packed red blood cells in adults with diseaseD000755 treated at an emergency hospital.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze the prescription of packed red blood cells performed by emergency physicians for adults with diseaseD000755. METHODS: Transfusions performed in adults with diseaseD000755 treated at an emergency service in Sao Bernardo do Campo, Sao Paulo Brazil, between January 2018 and January 2022 were evaluated. For data comparison, the chi-square2 test was used. The significance level adopted was 5%. RESULTS: A total of 114 transfusions were performed. The mean age was 41.8+-16.4 years, and pretransfusion hemoglobin was 6.1+-1.23 g/dL. Regarding the indication, the adequacy of transfusions performed in symptomatic individuals was significantly higher compared to asymptomatic individuals (100% vs. 3.9%, p<0.001). Symptomatic individuals received excessive volumes of packed red blood cells less frequently than asymptomatic individuals (17.5% vs. 56.9%, p<0.001). The filtered subtype, indicated for diseaseD000755, was prescribed in only a quarter of the 9606. However, non-indicated subtypes were frequently prescribed. CONCLUSION: This study found low adequacy in the indication and calculation of the transfusion volume of packed red blood cells in asymptomatic individuals. Few 9606 received filtered red blood cells, resulting in increased risks of transfusion reactions. On the contrary, non-indicated subtypes were prescribed in a quarter of transfusions, which resulted in higher costs and delay in receiving packed red blood cells.
38082534		Hoping for a normal life: Decision-making on hematopoietic stem cell transplantation by 9606 with a diseaseD006453 and their caregivers.BACKGROUND: To provide insight into the perspectives of children and young adults with transfusion-dependent diseaseD013789 and diseaseD000755 and their caregivers regarding the decision for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). PROCEDURE: A qualitative longitudinal multicenter study. Data collection consisted of 40 audio-recorded conversations between physicians and families and 77 interviews with 9606 and/or caregivers related to 27 unique cases, collected at different time points throughout the decision-making process. RESULTS: Conversations and interviews revealed "hoping for a normal life" as an overarching theme, consisting of four main topics: (i) "Building a frame of reference" refers to a process where 9606 or families try to obtain comprehensive information on HSCT and translate this to their situation to decide. (ii) "Balancing between loss and benefit" reports the process of considering the advantages and disadvantages of continuing with supportive care to treat their disease versus choosing HSCT. (iii) "Experiencing the impact of HSCT" describes the impactfull experience of the HSCT period by those who chose HSCT. (iv) "Balancing again" refers to reflecting on the decision made. CONCLUSIONS: The hope for a normal life guided the decision-making process, described as a constant balance between the impact of the disease and HSCT. A structured approach to explore 9606' and caregivers' perspectives on HSCT decision-making is needed, where specifically discussing the impact of the disease and hope for a normal life need to be integrated in the process.
38302122	Association|diseaseD006445|ncbi3043	Curative Therapies for diseaseD000755.diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755) is an diseaseD006453 that affects individuals worldwide. The mutation in the ncbi3043 gene leads to abnormal diseaseD006445 production, sickle hemoglobin, which polymerizes under stress leading to, among other end-organ manifestations, chronic diseaseD000743, debilitating diseaseD013224, and diseaseD020521. Unfortunately, chronic stress on end-organs impacts the life expectancy of 9606 with diseaseD000755, which in the United States averages 43 years, approximately 36 years less than people without the disease. Here, we review the progress made in curative interventions for those with diseaseD000755, namely allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation and gene therapy. These interventions continue to evolve as we better understand diseaseD000755 pathophysiology, use new diseaseD006086 prophylaxis regimens, expand stem cell donor options, and understand the genetic control of hemoglobin production. Although significant progress has been made, many gaps remain in the successful implementation of these interventions globally and for all 9606. [Pediatr Ann. 2024;53(2):e56-e61.].

In this case series of 17 patients (<21 years old) with diseaseD000755 who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, 16 (94.1%) experienced one or more diseaseD000168 after transplant, with the most common complications including acute or chronic diseaseD006086 (diseaseD006086) (34.1% of complications), diseaseD012871 of unknown origin (15.9% of complications), diseaseD007239 (15.9% of complications), and chemotherapy-related diseaseD005359 (11.4% of complications). Patients who developed acute or chronic diseaseD006086 were significantly older at the time of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. These findings highlight the need to closely monitor for diseaseD000168 in pediatric patients who undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for diseaseD000755 and underscore the importance of involving dermatology early on when diseaseD012871 occur, although further research with a larger multicenter study could help clarify the risk for diseaseD000168 and help identify potential ways to mitigate this risk.
37815822		Altered diseaseD010146 processing and sensitization in diseaseD000755: a scoping review of quantitative sensory testing findings.OBJECTIVES: Over 50% of adults living with diseaseD000755 have diseaseD059350, but the underlying mechanisms of diseaseD059350 in this population remain unclear. Quantitative sensory testing is an important measurement tool for understanding diseaseD010146 and sensory processing. This scoping review summarizes quantitative sensory testing methodologies used in sickle diseaseD002292 studies and the evidence for central sensitization in this population. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL to identify studies using quantitative sensory testing in individuals living with diseaseD000755. Search strategies were based on variations of the terms "diseaseD000755," and "quantitative sensory testing." Eligible studies were observational or experimental studies in human participants living with diseaseC536778 that reported findings and detailed methodology for at least one quantitative sensory testing modality. RESULTS: Our search yielded a total of 274 records; 27 of which are included in this scoping review. Of the 27 studies, 17 were original studies (with combined total of 516 adult and 298 pediatric participants) and 10 were secondary or subgroup analyses of these prior studies. Significant variation existed in quantitative sensory testing methodologies across studies, including testing locations, type and intensity of stimuli, and interpretation of findings. Of the identified studies, 22% (2/9 studies) reported diseaseD012678 in mechanical sensitivity and thresholds, 22% (2/9 studies) reported abnormal pressure diseaseD010146 thresholds, 46% (6/13 studies) reported diseaseD012678 in thermal diseaseD010146 thresholds and tolerance (cold and warm), and 50% (2/4 studies) reported abnormalities in temporal summation. CONCLUSION: Future studies should use standardized quantitative sensory testing protocols with consistent and operationalized definitions of sensitization to provide clear insight about diseaseD010146 processing and central sensitization in diseaseD000755.

38158354		Two-Dimensional Ultrasound Assessment of Long-Term Intra-Abdominal Organ Changes in Children with diseaseD000755 during Steady State: A Comparative Study.BACKGROUND: diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755) is a diseaseD025861 with global prevalence, including in Nigeria. Despite advancements in diseaseD000755 care management, understanding the long-term impact on organs during steady state has remained inconclusive. AIM: This study aimed to investigate the long-term changes in intra-abdominal organs of diseaseD000755 children compared with non-diseaseD000755 children during steady state using two-dimensional ultrasound assessment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 116 children (58 diseaseD000755 and 58 controls) were enrolled between June 2021 and July 2022. Clinico-demographic data were collected through an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Two-dimensional ultrasound was used to measure the liver, spleen, kidneys, and inferior vena cava in all subjects. Age-matched controls had AA or AS genotypes. RESULTS: Of the 58 9606 with diseaseD000755, 65.5% were males with an overall mean age of 8.1   3.4 years, while among the non-diseaseD000755 cohort (n = 58), 48.3% were males with an overall mean age of 8.7   3.9 years. There was no statistically significant difference in the age and gender distribution between the diseaseD000755 and non-diseaseD000755 cohorts (P = 0.390 and P = 0.091, respectively). diseaseD000755 subjects had a larger mean hepatic size than non-diseaseD000755 subjects (12.09 cm   2.23 vs. 11.67 cm   1.96; P = 0.276) but smaller mean splenic size (8.01 cm   1.89 vs. 8.19 cm   1.61; P = 0.577) and inferior vena cava diameter (1.16 cm   0.29 vs. 1.25 cm   0.33; P = 0.100). Left kidney length and breadth were significantly greater in diseaseD000755 9606 (8.91   1.16 vs. 8.27   1.30; P = 0.006 and 4.15   0.92 vs. 3.79   0.48; P = 0.008, respectively). CONCLUSION: This study highlights the utility of two-dimensional ultrasound assessment in monitoring intra-abdominal organ changes in diseaseD000755 children, suggesting its cost-effective benefits in monitoring health outcomes in diseaseD000755 9606.
37976795		Relative diseaseD000740 and perioperative diseaseD020521 in children with diseaseD009072.OBJECTIVES: Surgical revascularization for diseaseD009072 decreases long-term diseaseD020521 risk but carries a risk of perioperative diseaseD017202. We aimed to evaluate modifiable diseaseD020521 risk factors in children undergoing surgical revascularization for diseaseD009072. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this exploratory, single-center, retrospective cohort study, medical records of pediatric patients undergoing surgical revascularization for diseaseD009072 at our center between 2003 and 2021 were reviewed. Candidate modifiable risk factors were analyzed for association with perioperative diseaseD020521, defined as diseaseD002544 <=7 days after surgery. RESULTS: We analyzed 53 surgeries, consisting of 39 individual patients undergoing indirect surgical revascularization of 74 hemispheres. Perioperative diseaseD002544 occurred following five surgeries (9.4%). There were no instances of diseaseD000083302. Larger pre-to-postoperative decreases in hemoglobin (OR 3.90, p=0.017), hematocrit (OR 1.69, p=0.012) and blood urea nitrogen (OR 1.83, p=0.010) were associated with increased risk of perioperative diseaseD002544. Weight-adjusted intraoperative diseaseD016063 was not associated with risk of perioperative diseaseD002544 (OR 0.94, p=0.796). Among children with diseaseD000755, all of whom underwent exchange transfusion within one week prior to surgery, none experienced perioperative diseaseD020521. CONCLUSIONS: Decreases in hemoglobin, hematocrit, and blood urea nitrogen between the preoperative and postoperative periods are associated with increased risk of perioperative diseaseD020521. These novel findings suggest that dilutional diseaseD000740, possibly due to standardly administered hyperhydration, may increase the risk of perioperative diseaseD020521 in some children with diseaseD009072. Further work optimizing both mean arterial pressure and chemicalD010100-carrying capacity in these patients, including consideration of alternative blood transfusion thresholds, is necessary.
37979134		How We Treat diseaseD000755 in Pregnancy.50 years ago, people with diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755) were discouraged from becoming pregnant, but now most should be supported if they choose to pursue a pregnancy. They and their providers, however, should be aware of the physiological changes of pregnancy that aggravate diseaseD000755 and pregnancy's unique maternal and fetal challenges. Any maternal diseaseD005642 damage from a poorly perfused placenta has the potential for being superimposed on the diseaseD005642 damage of diseaseD000755. The immunological and mechanical changes of pregnancy contribute to an increased susceptibility to certain infections. Activation of the complement system and increased neutrophils may contribute to the increase in diseaseD013224 during pregnancy. There is an increased demand for red cell mass that is often not achievable without transfusion. Cardiac output increases by 45%. The anatomic and physiologic changes of pregnancy increase the risk of diseaseD007674. Pregnancy is a diseaseD019851 state which confers an increased risk of diseaseD013927. Maternal problems can arise from chronic underlying organ diseaseD006331 such as diseaseD007674 or diseaseD006976, from acute complications of diseaseD000755 such as acute diseaseD000740, diseaseD013224 and diseaseD056586, and/or from pregnancy-related complications such as diseaseD011225, diseaseD018805, severe diseaseD000740, diseaseD013923 and need for cesarean delivery. Fetal problems include alloimmunization, opioid exposure, diseaseD005317, diseaseD047928, and diseaseD050497. Prior to and during pregnancy, in addition to the assessment and care that every pregnant patient should receive, patients with diseaseD000755 should be evaluated and treated by a multidisciplinary team with respect to their unique maternal and fetal issues.
37820110		Implementation of Hospital-Based diseaseD000755 Newborn Screening and Follow-Up Programs in Haiti.One in 120 children are born with diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755) in Haiti. However, healthcare challenges include isolated newborn screening (NBS) activities and lack of transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) to assess diseaseD020521 risk. The implementation activities of the "Comparative Study of Children in Haiti and Miami with diseaseD000755 (CSHSCD) involved both NBS and TCD implementations in four Haitian clinical sites. We hypothesized that hospital-based diseaseD000755 NBS and follow-up programs would be feasible in Haiti. Traditional NBS laboratory method with dried blood samples was performed at two Port-au-Prince sites, and the traditional method plus point-of-care (POC) testing was utilized at the two north sites. The rate of clinical follow-up for newborns with diseaseD000755 as outcome for the NBS intervention was compared to the NBS method. The NBS programs identified diseaseD000755 in 0.77% of 8,224 newborns over a 24-month period. In the rural hospital assigned to the combination screening, 56% of newborns identified with POC returned for follow-up compared to 0% when POC was not available (p=0.044). Positive newborns and children <6 years of age with diseaseD000755 at the clinical sites were eligible for study follow-up. Accrual was successful: 165 participants (mean age 42 months, 53% males, 93% SS) were recruited and received oral chemicalD010406. TCD screening was hampered by poor internet and trained staff leaving Haiti, with only one active site conducting screening. Despite challenges, the implementation of NBS and diseaseD000755 programs in Haiti is feasible. We are in the process of understanding how to mitigate implementation limitations.
37833213		Concurrent diseaseD017562 Does Not Increase Splenectomy Morbidity in Patients With diseaseD000743: A Pediatric NSQIP Analysis.PURPOSE: Children undergoing splenectomy for diseaseD000743 often have diseaseD002769, which may or may not be symptomatic. It is unclear whether concurrent diseaseD017562 increases length of stay or morbidity after splenectomy. The purpose of this study was to compare morbidity among children undergoing laparoscopic splenectomy alone versus splenectomy with concurrent diseaseD017562 in patients with diseaseD000743. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated children with diseaseD000743 undergoing non-traumatic laparoscopic splenectomy in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program-Pediatric database (2012-2020). Outcomes were compared for patients undergoing splenectomy alone (n = 1010) versus splenectomy with diseaseD017562 (n = 371). Pearson's Chi-square and Student's t-tests were utilized as appropriate. Propensity score-matching was completed, controlling for eight demographic and clinical variables. RESULTS: 1381 patients were identified, 73.1% undergoing splenectomy alone and 26.9% splenectomy with diseaseD017562. Splenectomy with diseaseD017562 patients were older (10.9 years vs. 8.4 years, p < 0.01), more likely to have diseaseD013103 (56.1% vs. 40.8%, p < 0.01), less likely to have diseaseD000755 (12.1% vs. 33.5%, p < 0.01), more likely ASA class 1 or 2 (49.3% vs. 42.1%, p < 0.01), and had similar preoperative hematocrit levels (29.6 vs. 29.3, p = 0.33). The splenectomy with diseaseD017562 group was less likely to receive preoperative blood transfusions (13.5% vs. 25.4%, p < 0.01). There were 360 pairs selected on propensity score-matching, and splenectomy with diseaseD017562 was associated with increased operative time (182 min vs. 145 min, p < 0.01) and decreased occurrences of a postoperative transfusion (4.2% vs. 8.9%, p = 0.01). Length of stay after surgery (2.5 days vs. 2.3 days, p = 0.13), composite morbidity (3.9% vs. 3.4%, p = 0.69), and 30-day readmission rates (3.3% vs. 7.4%, p = 0.08) were all similar. CONCLUSIONS: Splenectomy with diseaseD017562 is associated with similar postoperative morbidity, length of stay and readmission rates compared to splenectomy alone. These data support the safety of concurrent diseaseD017562 with splenectomy for children with diseaseD002769 in the setting of diseaseD000743. TYPE OF STUDY: Retrospective Cohort Study. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III.

38015105		Intravenous fluid therapy and hospital outcomes for diseaseD001157 in children, adolescents, and young adults with diseaseD000755.BACKGROUND: While intravenous fluid (IVF) therapy in patients with diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755) admitted for a diseaseD001157 (diseaseD001157) can help reduce red blood cell sickling, clinical practice varies across institutions. We examined the relationship between IVF therapy and hospital length of stay (HLOS), as well as adverse events, such as diseaseD000208 diseaseD056586 (diseaseD056586), pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) transfer, and 28-day re-admission. METHODS: This is a single-center retrospective analysis of diseaseD000755 hospitalizations between January 2015 and April 2020. Patients with diseaseD000755, age 0-30, with consecutive hospitalizations for diseaseD001157 were included. For the first 3 days of each admission, an "IVF ratio" was calculated by dividing actual IVF rate administered by weight-based maintenance IVF (mIVF) rate. RESULTS: A total of 617 hospitalizations for 161 patients were included. Mean HLOS was 5.7 days, (SD 3.9), and mean IVF volume over the first 3 days of admission was 139.6 mL/kg/day (SD 57.8). Multivariate analysis showed that for each additional 0.5 times the mIVF rate, HLOS increased by 0.53 day (p < .001; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.609-0.989), but there was no significant association between IVF therapy and adverse events. History of diseaseD059350 was associated with increased odds of re-admission (OR 6.4; 95% CI: 3.93-10.52). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the theoretical potential for IVF therapy to slow down the sickling process, our findings suggest that increased IVF therapy was associated with prolonged HLOS, which places a burden on patients, families, and the health system.
37863704		Debate: Should the loss of disability adjusted life years (DALY) define the focus of Global Hematology?: The case for prioritizing capacity building in diseaseD000740 management and blood transfusion.Setting priorities in healthcare is always contentious given the array of possible services at primary, secondary, and tertiary levels of care, not to mention potential public health interventions. The central goals in global policy have been reducing inequity within and between countries, protecting vulnerable groups (particularly women and children) and reducing the major diseaseD003141 which have historically been a major burden in lower- and middle-income countries. Here limited relative and absolute spending on healthcare have spurred a series of initiatives in Global Health over the last 50 years which have led to significant gains in measures of morbidity and mortality. Against this background there remains the continuing question of how to adapt current medical practice in higher income countries for training and planning of services in lower- and middle-income countries. Here, the historical development of Global Health is outlined, and lessons drawn from the surveys of the global burden of disease and health economic analysis to understand how we can apply these principles to define Global Hematology. It remains likely that in lower-income countries effort should be concentrated on developing laboratory services and blood transfusion, to allow safe and effective support for the assessment of treatment of diseaseD000740, diseaseD000755, maternal and child health and urgent surgery and obstetric services. However, the principles of Global Health, could also be used for diseaseD019337 to develop a framework for Global Hematology for all settings.
37883803		Cerebral hemodynamic changes after haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplant in adults with diseaseD000755.Preliminary evidence from four adults with diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755) suggests that hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) improves cerebral hemodynamics. HSCT largely normalizes cerebral hemodynamics in children with diseaseD000755. We tested the hypothesis in adults with diseaseD000755 that cerebral blood flow (CBF), chemicalD010100 extraction fraction (OEF), and cerebral metabolic rate of chemicalD010100 (CMRO2) measured using MRI, normalized to healthy values, comparing measurements approximately one month before to 12-24 months following HSCT (n=11; age=33.3+-8.9 years; 389+-150 days post-HSCT) to age-, race- and sex-matched values from healthy adults without diseaseD012805 (n=28; age=30.2+-5.6 years). Prior to transplant, 7 patients had neurological indications for transplant (e.g., overt diseaseD020521) and 4 had non-neurological reasons for haploidentical bone marrow transplant (haploBMT). All received haploBMT from first-degree relatives (parent, sibling, or child donor) with reduced-intensity preparation and maintained engraftment. Pre-transplant, CBF was elevated (CBF=69.11 24.7 ml/100g/min) compared to controls (p = 0.004). Mean CBF declined significantly following haploBMT (post-transplant CBF=48.2+-13.9 ml/100g/min, p=0.003). OEF was not different from controls at baseline and did not change significantly following HaploBMT (pre-transplant: 43.1 6.7%; post-transplant: 39.6 7.0%, p=0.34). Post-transplant, CBF and OEF were not significantly different from controls (CBF=48.2 13.4 ml/100g/min; p=0.78, and OEF=39.6 7.0%; p>0.99). CMRO2 did not change significantly following haploBMT (pre-transplant=3.18 0.87 ml chemicalD010100/100g/min; post-transplant: 2.95 0.83; p=0.56). Major complications of haploBMT included one diseaseD007239-related diseaseD003643 and one severe chronic diseaseD006086. HaploBMT in adults with diseaseD000755 reduces CBF to control values and maintains OEF and CMRO2 on average at levels observed in healthy adult controls.
38265872		Sexual Maturation of Female Adolescent 9606 with diseaseD000755 in Lagos, Nigeria.BACKGROUND: diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755) has been shown to have adverse effects on growth and sexual development. Recent Nigerian studies have reported a declining trend in the age of sexual maturation and menarche in haemoglobin AA (HbAA) individuals. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the sexual maturation of female 9606 with diseaseD000755 aged 10 to 19 years seen at Lagos University Teaching Hospital Idi-Araba, Lagos and Sickle Cell Foundation. METHODS: It was a cross-sectional study involving 140 girls with diseaseD000755 (subjects) and an equal number of girls with HbAA (controls) who were matched for age and socio-economic class over a fivemonth period. The evaluation involved anthropometry, calculation of BMI and determination of breast and pubic hair development using Tanner staging. RESULTS: The mean BMI for the subjects was 17.2+-2.39 kg/m2and 20.2+-3.09 kg/m2 for the controls (p < 0.001). The mean age at onset of breast development (B2) was 13 +- 0.39 years in the subjects and 10.5 +- 0.51 years in the controls (p < 0.001). The corresponding mean age for pubic hair development (PH2) was also higher at 13.8 +- 0.59 years for the girls with diseaseD000755 and 10.4 +- 0.51 years for the controls (p <0.001), while menarche was achieved in the subjects at 14.7 +- 1.68 years and in the controls at 12.3 +- 1.33 years (p < 0.001). Upper socioeconomic class was associated with earlier menarche and faster transition from pre-pubertal stage to pubertal stage of sexual maturation in the controls but was not observed in the diseaseD000755 subjects. CONCLUSION: Sexual maturity in 9606 with diseaseD000755 lagged behind those of the HbAA controls.
38138299		diseaseD010146 Control for diseaseD000755 Crisis, a Novel Approach? A Retrospective Study.Background and Objectives: diseaseD010146 management poses a significant challenge for 9606 experiencing diseaseD001157 (diseaseD001157) in diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755). While opioid therapy is highly effective, its efficacy can be impeded by undesirable side effects. Local regional anesthesia (LRA), involving the deposition of a perineural anesthetic, provides a nociceptive blockade, local vasodilation and reduces the diseaseD007249 response. However, the effectiveness of this therapeutic approach for diseaseD001157 in diseaseD000755 9606 has been rarely reported up to now. The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a single-shot local regional anesthesia (LRA) in reducing diseaseD010146 and consequently enhancing the management of severe diseaseD001157 (diseaseD001157) in adults with diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755) unresponsive to conventional analgesic therapy. Materials and Methods: We first collected consecutive episodes of diseaseD001157 in critical care (ICU and emergency room) for six months in 2022 in a French University hospital with a large population of diseaseD000755 9606 in the West Indies population. We also performed a systematic review of the use of LRA in diseaseD000755. The primary outcome was defined using a numeric diseaseD010146 score (NPS) and/or percentage of change in opioid use. Results: We enrolled nine diseaseD000755 adults (28 years old, 4 females) for ten episodes of diseaseD001157 in whom LRA was used for diseaseD010146 management. Opioid reduction within the first 24 h post block was -75% (50 to 96%). Similarly, the NPS decreased from 9/10 pre-block to 0-1/10 post-block. Five studies, including one case series with three 9606 and four case reports, employed peripheral nerve blocks for regional anesthesia. In general, local regional anesthesia (LRA) exhibited a reduction in diseaseD010146 and symptoms, along with a decrease in opioid consumption post-procedure. Conclusions: LRA improves diseaseD010146 scores, reduces opioid consumption in diseaseD000755 9606 with refractory diseaseD010146, and may mitigate opioid-related side effects while facilitating the transition to oral analgesics. Furthermore, LRA is a safe and effective procedure.

This study aims to evaluate the clinical and epidemiological features and therapeutic options of diseaseD010020 in diseaseD000755 patients in Qatar. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on a 49 diseaseD000755 patients who were diagnosed with diseaseD010020 and attended the hematology clinic at the National Center for diseaseD009369 care & research, Hamad Medical Corporation, Qatar between Jan-2011 to Jan2021.  Results: Forty-nine adult patients with diseaseD000755 who were diagnosed with diseaseD010020 were studied. The median age of the study population is 32 years, and the median age at the first diseaseD010020 diagnosis was 26 years (range: 11-44 yr.). 37 (75.5%) patients suffered from multiple joints diseaseD010020 while 12(24.5%) had single joint involvement. 31 (63.3%) patients had bilateral hip diseaseD010020 and 18 (36.7%) had diseaseD000070599. 30 patients (61%) were on chemicalD006918 treatment. Based on FICAT and Alert classification of diseaseD010020, 57 % of patients had stage III and above at first diagnosis. 20 (40.8%) were managed with a conservative approach, 11 (22.4%) received hyperbaric chemicalD010100 with good response, 6(12.2%) underwent hip core decompression and 12(24.5%) underwent hip replacement surgery. CONCLUSION: In diseaseD000755 patients, diseaseD010020 occurred more during the 3rd and 4th decades of life. The majority of diseaseD010020 represented with advanced stage and had multiple joint involvements. We recommend adopting a low threshold of joint imaging for early detection and prevention of further complications.

Because this alkylating agent is increasingly utilized as conditioning prior to gene therapy in nonmalignant diseaseD006402, more precise characterization of chemicalD002066's potential contribution to subsequent malignant risk is warranted. PROCEDURE: We conducted a literature-based assessment of chemicalD002066 and subsequent late effects, with emphasis on diseaseD009369, identifying publications via PubMed searches, and selecting those reporting at least 3 years of follow-up. RESULTS: We identified eight pediatric and 13 adult publications describing long-term follow-up in 570 pediatric and 2076 adult hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients. diseaseD009369 were reported in 0.5% of pediatric HCT recipients, with no cases of diseaseD009190 (diseaseD009190) or diseaseD015470 (diseaseD015470). Fatal diseaseD009369 were reported in 0.8% of 1887 evaluable adult HCT recipients, and an overall incidence of diseaseD009369 of 4.8% was reported in a subset of 389 evaluable adult patients. We also reviewed long-term results from eight publications evaluating lentiviral- and human promotor-based HSC-targeted gene therapy in 215 patients with nonmalignant conditions, in which chemicalD002066/chemicalC018404 monotherapy or chemicalD002066/chemicalC024352 was the only conditioning. Two diseaseD009369 were reported in patients with diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755), one of which was potentially chemicalD002066-related. No additional diseaseD009369 were reported in 173 patients with follow-up of 5-12 years. CONCLUSION: The incidence of chemicalD002066-related diseaseD009369 is low, and likely to be substantially less than 1% in pediatric transplant recipients, especially those receiving chemicalD002066 monotherapy for nonmalignant conditions other than diseaseD000755.

38000628		Gene-addition/editing therapy in diseaseD000755.Gene therapy is an innovative strategy that offers potential cure for patients with diseaseD000755, and no appropriate donor for transplant consideration. While we await long term data from these clinical trials, we remain optimistic that gene therapy will become a standard of care for curative treatment in diseaseD000755. As gene therapy becomes a standard of treatment in diseaseD000755, we must also acknowledge the potential for financial burden to patients. We also must acknowledge the prevalence of diseaseD000755 in low-resource settings. Hopefully, as we learn more about gene therapy, we can assess ways to overcome the financial diseaseD064420 that comes with this therapy.

38069526		Euvolemic automated transfusion to treat severe diseaseD000740 in diseaseD000755 9606 at risk of diseaseD065227.BACKGROUND: Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion remains a major treatment for diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755). 9606 with diseaseD000755 have a high prevalence of diseaseD007674 and diseaseD004194, conferring risk of transfusion-associated diseaseD065227 (diseaseD065227). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We describe an approach, titled euvolemic automated transfusion (EAT), to transfuse diseaseD000755 9606 with severe diseaseD000740 who are at risk of diseaseD065227. In EAT, plasmapheresis is performed using donor RBCs, rather than albumin or plasma, as replacement fluid. Euvolemia is maintained. A retrospective analysis was conducted of 9606 with diseaseD000755 who underwent EAT at our institution over a 10-year period, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of EAT. RESULTS: Eleven diseaseD000755 9606 underwent 109 EAT procedures (1-59 procedures per 9606). The median age was 42 years (IQR = [30-49]) and 82% (n = 9) were female. Most (82%; n = 9) 9606 had severe chronic kidney disease and 55% (n = 6) had heart failure. One (9%) 9606 had a history of life-threatening diseaseD065227. Mean pre- and post-procedure Hct values were 19.8% (SD   1.6%) and 29.1% (SD   1.4%), respectively. The average Hct increment was 3.2% per RBC unit. Only two EAT-related complications were recorded during the 109 procedures: central line-associated diseaseD007239 and citrate diseaseD064420 (diseaseD009120). EAT used an average of two RBC units less than that projected for standard automated RBC exchange. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that EAT is safe and effective to treat 9606 with diseaseD000755 and severe diseaseD000740, who are at risk for diseaseD065227. EAT requires fewer RBC units compared to automated RBC exchange.
38066846		Logistics, risks, and benefits of automated red blood cell exchange for 9606 with diseaseD000755.Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions treat and prevent severe complications of diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755) and can be delivered as a simple or exchange transfusion. During an exchange, some of the 9606's abnormal hemoglobin (Hb) S (HbS) RBCs are removed. An apheresis device can accomplish an automated RBC exchange, simultaneously removing 9606's RBCs while returning other blood components along with normal RBCs. Automated RBC exchange is therefore an isovolemic transfusion that can efficiently decrease HbS RBCs while limiting iron loading and hyperviscosity. However, specialized equipment, trained personnel, appropriate vascular access, and increased RBC exposure are required compared to simple or manual RBC exchange. Therefore, risks and benefits must be balanced to make individualized decisions for 9606 with diseaseD000755 who require transfusion.
