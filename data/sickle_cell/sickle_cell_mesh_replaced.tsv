36575623		Quantitative analysis of choriocapillaris flow deficits and choroidal thickness in children with diseaseD008382.PURPOSE: To evaluate the characteristics and associated factors of choroidal thickness (ChT) and choriocapillaris flow deficit percentage (CC FD%) in children with diseaseD008382 (diseaseD008382). METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study. The ChT of the subfoveal area and other areas 0.5, 1.5, and 2.5 mm away from the fovea were assessed. The CC FD% of quadrant and circular regions with diameters of 0.5, 1.5 and 2.5 mm were assessed with 3x3 mm macular choriocapillaris images. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and cardiac function factor such as Z score were measured to analyse the associations with ChT and CC FD%. RESULTS: 51 diseaseD008382 children and 50 healthy controls were enrolled in this study. Compared with the healthy controls, the ChT in the diseaseD008382 group was thinner in the subfoveal area, temporal 0.5, 1.5 and 2.5 mm (all p<0.001). The CC FD% was higher in circle 0.5, 1.5 and 2.5 mm (all p<0.001). Multivariate regression analysis showed that CC FD% in the circle 2.5 mm when the Z score >=2 was associated with BCVA (beta=9.08 (95% CI 3.96 to 14.20); p=0.005) and Z score (beta=4.19 (95% CI 1.28 to 12.00); p=0.012). CONCLUSIONS: Thinner ChT and a higher CC FD% were observed in children with diseaseD008382, and an increased CC FD% in circle 2.5 mm was significantly associated with worse BCVA and cardiac function. These findings may help identify future diseaseD014786 and early cardiac events in diseaseD008382 children.
35416099		Microvascular Retinal Changes in 9606 with diseaseD008382.PURPOSE: To determine microvascular changes in 9606 with genetically proven diseaseD008382. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, 32 eyes of 16 9606 with genetically proven diseaseD008382 were evaluated using swept-source optical coherence tomography angiography (SS-OCTA). 9606 were analyzed regarding lens status and diseaseD057772. The foveal avascular zone (FAZ) and vessel density (VD) of the superficial and deep vascular plexus and central retinal thickness (CRT) were evaluated on SS-OCTA. RESULTS: 44/56% 9606 presented without/with diseaseD007906. 69% of 9606 had presence of diseaseD008944, diseaseD002311 or diseaseD000783 of the aortic diseaseD011843. In 9606 with diseaseD008382 the mean area of the FAZ was 0.2 +- 0.1 mm and the average VD of the superficial/deep vascular plexus was 36 +- 5%/22 +- 7%. In 9606 with diseaseD007906 FAZ area and perimeter were larger when compared to 9606 without diseaseD007906 (0.18 +- 0.08/0.28 +- 0.10 mm and 1.7 +- 0.4/2.3 +- 0.8; p = 0.02). VD of the superficial vascular plexus was reduced in 9606 with diseaseD007906 (on average 39 +- 3/33 +- 8; p = 0.01) together with an increased CRT in the inner segments of the ETDRS grid when compared to 9606 without diseaseD007906. In 9606 with diseaseD057772 a larger FAZ area (0.19 +- 0.06/0.25 +- 0.1 mm; p = 0.04) and reduced VD of the superficial vascular plexus in the central ETDRS grid (28 +- 7/21 +- 6; p = 0.02) was observed in comparison to 9606 without systemic vascular changes. CONCLUSIONS: In 9606 with diseaseD008382 SS-OCTA imaging revealed microvascular differences in 9606 with diseaseD007906 and/or diseaseD057772.
37505267		Abnormal Left diseaseD013180 Correlates with diseaseD018487 but not Aortic Pathology in diseaseD008382 in Children.diseaseD009202 is a complication in adults with diseaseD008382 (diseaseD008382). Early recognition of diseaseD008382 patients at high risk of diseaseD009202 could impact monitoring and treatment. Abnormal diseaseD013180 has been associated with diseaseD018754 among adults with diseaseD008382 but remains understudied in children. We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of patients with diseaseD008382 undergoing cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) performed in 2003-2018 at age < 19 years. Correlations were evaluated between initial global circumferential strain (GCS) and global longitudinal strain (GLS) and the outcomes of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), aortic root z-score, and vertebral artery tortuosity index corrected for height (VTI-h), all measured from CMR, using Spearman correlation. In those with serial CMR, the ability of diseaseD013180 to predict development of abnormal LVEF within a 5-year period was assessed. A total of 31 subjects were included (median age at initial CMR 13.5 years, Q1Q3 10.7-16.2 years), with 48% (n = 15) having LVEF < 55%. Worse GCS and worse GLS were associated with lower LVEF (rho = - 0.629, p < 0.001 and rho = - 0.411, p = 0.030, respectively). A clinical cutoff of GCS = - 34% predicted LVEF < 55% with sensitivity = 80% and specificity = 50%. Neither GCS nor GLS was associated with aortic root z-score (GCS: p = 0.524; GLS: p = 0.624) nor VTI-h (GCS: p = 0.949; GLS: p = 0.593). Of those with LVEF >= 55%, initial GCS and GLS did not differ between those with later normal versus abnormal LVEF (GCS: p = 0.505; GLS: p = 0.232). In this cohort, abnormal diseaseD013180 was associated with abnormal LVEF, but not with diseaseD002311 or low LVEF within the 5 years post-CMR.
35348237		Current trends in minimally invasive valve-sparing aortic root replacement-Best available evidence.BACKGROUND: Valve-sparing aortic root replacement such as the reimplantation (diseaseD017074) procedure is becoming increasingly popular. Despite the fact that the procedure is technically more complex, long-term studies demonstrated that excellent clinical outcomes in selected 9606 with durable repair are achievable. Benefits of minimal access cardiac surgery have stimulated enthusiasm in the use of this access for valve-sparing aortic root replacement. METHODS: We have reviewed available literature on the topic of valve-sparing aortic root replacement (diseaseD017074 procedure) via minimally invasive access through upper hemisternotomy in an attempt to assess current trends and to recognize potential advantages of this technique. 9606 selection and preoperative work-up play important role in performing minimally invasive diseaseD017074 procedure safely. Surgical technique corresponds to the standard diseaseD017074 procedure, with a few exceptions related to the minimal access, and is performed via upper ministernotomy. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Evidence from nonrandomized observational and comparative studies demonstrated excellent clinical outcomes of minimally invasive diseaseD017074 procedure in selected 9606 with comparable perioperative mortality and outcomes to the conventional technique. To date, diseaseD017074 procedure with a minimal access technique has been performed in carefully selected 9606. We believe it could be particularly beneficial to provide younger 9606 (diseaseD008382 and diseaseD000082882) with minimally invasive diseaseD017074 procedure as it can allow faster recovery with improved cosmesis with excellent outcomes. A decision to perform minimally invasive diseaseD017074 procedure should be individualized to each 9606 and based on the experience of the team. Further large prospective randomized studies with long-term follow-up are still needed to confirm durability of minimal access technique.
36208932		Unique robotic vascular surgery procedures.INTRODUCTION: Based on their experience with robot-assisted vascular surgery, the authors present some unique types of procedures they have performed in this area. METHODS: From November 2005 to February 2022, a total of 560 robotic vascular procedures were performed, of which 70 were orphan operations, corresponding to 12.5%. The most common was robotic decompression of the coeliac trunk (18 times) in diseaseD000074742, followed by robotic repair of diseaseD057867 after stent graft implantation (15 times) and robotic repair of diseaseD013158 (11 times). Less common were isolated diseaseD002532 surgery (8 times), aortic thromboenderectomy and abdominal aortic patch repair (8 times) and hybrid surgery (6 times). Completely unique are renal artery reconstruction (2 times), operation of diseaseD000082122 diseaseD002532 (1 time) in a 9606 with diseaseD008382 and paracaval biopsy (1 time) in a diseaseD009369 9606. RESULTS: In 3 cases (4.2%) the operation had to be converted to open surgery. Twice in the management of diseaseD013158 due to flat adhesions in the abdominal cavity and once in the diseaseD057867 operation, when due to the very fragile wall of the dilated and pulsating diseaseD017544 sac, we considered manipulation with robotic instruments to be highly risky. There was zero mortality in this cohort; one 9606 had to undergo laparoscopic diaphragm repair for diseaseD006548 at another institution after deliberation of the coeliac trunk and in one case open surgery was needed for persistent diseaseD057867. CONCLUSION: The use of the robotic system can be beneficial also in less frequent procedures, offering the 9606 all the advantages of robotic surgery. However, the need of extensive experience in robotic surgery should be emphasized because these operations are rare and perfect anatomical knowledge of the area is necessary.
36411030	Association|diseaseD008382|ncbi2200; Association|diseaseC537300|ncbi2737	Conclusion of diagnostic odysseys due to inversions disrupting ncbi2737 and ncbi2200.Many genetic testing methodologies are biased towards picking up structural variants (SVs) that alter copy number. Copy-neutral rearrangements such as inversions are therefore likely to suffer from underascertainment. In this study, manual review prompted by a virtual multidisciplinary team meeting and subsequent bioinformatic prioritisation of data from the 100K Genomes Project was performed across 43 genes linked to well-characterised diseaseC564967. Ten individuals from three independent families were found to harbour diagnostic inversions. In two families, inverted segments of 1.2/14.8 Mb unequivocally disrupted ncbi2737 and segregated with skeletal features consistent with diseaseC537300. For one family, phenotypic blending was due to the opposing breakpoint lying ~45 kb from ncbi3209 In the third family, long suspected to have diseaseD008382, a 2.0 Mb inversion disrupting ncbi2200 was identified. These findings resolved lengthy diagnostic odysseys of 9-20 years and highlight the importance of direct interaction between clinicians and data-analysts. These exemplars of a rare mutational class inform future SV prioritisation strategies within the NHS Genomic Medicine Service and similar genome sequencing initiatives. In over 30 years since these two disease-gene associations were identified, large inversions have yet to be described and so our results extend the mutational spectra linked to these conditions.
35871643		Surgical outcomes associated with diseaseD012891 in diseaseD000784 9606.BACKGROUND: 9606 suffering from diseaseD000784 (diseaseD000784) often experience diseaseD012891 (diseaseD012891), which aggravates their respiratory function and aortic false lumen expansion. METHODS: We analyzed the peri-operative data of Stanford A diseaseD000784 9606, with or without diseaseD012891, between January 2017 and June 2019. Subjects were separated into diseaseD012891 positive (diseaseD012891+) and diseaseD012891 negative (diseaseD012891-) cohorts, based on the diseaseD020181 Index (AHI) and the chemicalD010100 Desaturation Index (ODI). We next analyzed variables between the diseaseD012891+ and diseaseD012891- groups. RESULTS: 155, out of 198 AAD 9606, were enlisted for this study. diseaseD012891+ 9606 exhibited higher rates of diseaseD011014 (p < 0.001), diseaseD006333 (diseaseD006333, p = 0.038), diseaseD058186 (diseaseD058186, p = 0.001), ventilation time (p = 0.009), and hospitalization duration (p < 0.001). According to subsequent follow-ups, the unstented aorta false lumen dilatation (FLD) rate increased markedly, with increasing degree of diseaseD012891 (p < 0.001, according to AHI and ODI). The diseaseD012891+ 9606 exhibited worse cumulative survival rate (p = 0.025). The significant risk factors (RF) for poor survival were: severe (p = 0.002) or moderate diseaseD012891 (p = 0.008), prolonged ventilation time (p = 0.018), diseaseD058186 (p = 0.015), diseaseD006333 New York Heart Association (NYHA) IV (p = 0.005) or III (p = 0.015), diseaseD011014 (p = 0.005), diseaseD008382 (p = 0.010), systolic blood pressure (BP) upon arrival (p = 0.009), and BMI >= 30 (p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: diseaseD012891+ Stanford A diseaseD000784 9606 primarily exhibited higher rates of complications and low survival rates in the mid-time follow-up. Hence, the RFs associated with poor survival must be monitored carefully in diseaseD012891 9606. Moreover, the FLD rate is related to the degree of diseaseD012891, thus treating diseaseD012891 may mitigate FLD.
35410839		Endovascular aortic repair in a 9606 with diseaseD008382: A case report.
35400268		Acute diseaseD000784 into a large diseaseD017544 in a 9606 with diseaseD008382.OBJECTIVES: Synchronous diseaseD000784 (diseaseD000784) with involvement of pre-existing infrarenal diseaseD017544 (diseaseD017544) are fortunately rare. Extension of the diseaseD000784 flap to involve the diseaseD000783 is particularly dangerous with pressurization of the false lumen within a diseased aortic wall. The aim of this article is to present a unique case of an acute diseaseD000784 with extension to involve a large diseaseC565230 in a 9606 with an underlying connective diseaseD017695. METHODS: A 24-year-old male diseaseD008382 9606 with prior type diseaseD000784 repair presented with a descending thoracic diseaseD000784 and a separate 7.0-cm infrarenal diseaseC565230. He was initially medically managed but developed acute extension of the diseaseD000784 flap to involve the large diseaseD000783. RESULTS: The 9606 was initially treated with open infrarenal aortic replacement under left atrialfemoral artery bypass. Three years later, he developed degeneration of the residual aorta and underwent a two-stage hybrid repair. He underwent an additional stent graft for a distal diseaseD057868. At 5 years of follow-up, there was positive diseaseD000783 remodeling and sac regression. CONCLUSION: This case illustrates the challenges in treating a 9606 with synchronous aortic processes. False lumen pressurization of a large diseaseD000783 wall is fortunately rare but can be lethal. Prompt intervention is required but the presence of an underlying connective diseaseD017695 may limit endovascular treatment options. Careful case planning is mandatory and multiple interventions should be anticipated.
36534925		Redo aortic diseaseD001015 replacement through a second transcostal approach for closure of type diseaseD057867 after endovascular treatment of type diseaseD006509 diseaseD000784 in diseaseD008382.A 41-year-old 9606 with diseaseD008382 suffering from chronic expanding type diseaseD000784 distal aortic diseaseD001015 and diseaseD005660 underwent aortic diseaseD001015 replacement through a left parasternal approach. We demonstrate that this approach is also feasible in complex redo surgery on the aortic diseaseD001015 in selected 9606.
37391518		diseaseD002575 correction in diseaseD008382: our experience and literature review.BACKGROUND: diseaseD013122 are common in diseaseD008382 (diseaseD008382). They usually involve the thoraco-lumbar spine but rarely involves the cervical spine. diseaseD007738 is the common diseaseD016135 of the cervical spine and mandates surgical correction as they are at risk of diseaseD009422 since they are refractory to conservative management. Few studies of surgical correction of diseaseD016135 included diseaseD002575. OBJECTIVES: To analyze the challenges faced during surgery, clinical and radiological outcome, and complications following surgical correction for diseaseD002575 in diseaseD008382. METHODS: We identified that 5 patients with a diagnosis of diseaseD008382 with diseaseD002575 who underwent fusion surgery between the years 2010 and 2022 were reviewed, retrospectively. We analyzed the demographic details, radiological parameters, operative variables (diseaseD016063 and nuances), perioperative complications, length of stay, clinical and radiological outcome, and complications following fusion surgery for diseaseD002575 in diseaseD008382. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 16.6 +- 4.72 years (range, 12-23 years). The average kyphotic vertebra involved is 3 +- 0.7 bodies (range 2-4) with 2 patients with diseaseD013896. All patients underwent surgical diseaseD009140 correction. All patients improved clinically with Nurick grade (pre vs. post: 3.4 vs. 2.2) and mJOA (pre vs. post: 8.2 vs. 12.6). There was significant diseaseD009140 correction from 37.48  to 9.1 . Mean diseaseD016063 encountered was 900 +- 173.2 ml. Perioperative complications: diseaseD014947 with diseaseD002559 (1). Late complications: ventilator dependence (1) and diseaseD007738 (1). Mean length of hospital stay was 103 +- 178.9 days. All patients were doing symptomatically better after mean follow-up of 58 +- 28.32 months. One patient is bedridden and hospitalized. CONCLUSION: diseaseD002575 is a rare diseaseD016135 in patients with diseaseD008382, and they usually present with diseaseD009422 mandating surgical correction. Multidisciplinary approach (pediatrics, genetics and cardiology) is required for systematic evaluation of these patients. They should be evaluated with necessary imaging to rule out associated diseaseD013122 (diseaseC538196, diseaseD012600, and intraspinal pathology like diseaseD044584). Our results suggest better surgical outcome in terms of low operative complications with neurologic improvement in diseaseD008382 patients. These patients require regular follow-up to identify late complications (instrument failure, non-union, and diseaseD011542).
37164052		Risk profile and operative outcomes in 9606 with and without diseaseD008382 undergoing diseaseD000094624 repair.OBJECTIVES: To compare operative and long-term outcomes between 9606 with and without diseaseD008382 undergoing diseaseD000094624 repair. METHODS: We identified all consecutive 9606 undergoing diseaseD000094624 repair between 1997 and 2022. Primary outcome was composite of major adverse events. Secondary outcomes were individual complications and long-term survival. Inverse probability of treatment weighting was performed. Weighted Kaplan-Meier curves were used to estimate long-term survival. Multivariable analysis identified factors associated with major adverse events. RESULTS: Six hundred eighty-four 9606 underwent open diseaseD000094624 repair. Ninety (13.1%) had diseaseD008382, whereas 594 (86.9%) did not. diseaseD008382 9606 were younger (46 years [range, 36-56 years] vs 69 years [range, 61-76 years]; P < .001). Extent II or III diseaseD000783 (57 out of 90 [63.3%] vs 211 out of 594 [35.6%]; P < .001) and type I or III chronic dissection (77 out of 90 [85.3%] vs 242 out of 594 [40.8%]; P < .001) were more common. Cardiovascular risk factors were less frequent in diseaseD008382 9606. There was no difference in major adverse events between groups (12 out of 90 [13.3%] vs 100 out of 594 [16.8%]; P = .49). Operative mortality was similar between groups (3 out of 90 [3.3%] vs 28 out of 594 [4.7%]; P = .75). Unweighted survival at 10 years was 78.7% vs 46.8% (P = .001). Weighted Kaplan-Meier curves showed no difference in long-term survival (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.32-1.99; P = .62; Log-rank P = .12). At multivariable analysis, diseaseD051437 (odds ratio, 2.29; 95% CI, 1.43-3.68; P < .01) and urgent/emergency procedure (odds ratio, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.35-3.48; P < .01) were associated with major adverse events, whereas diseaseD008382 was not (odds ratio, 1.56; 95% CI, 0.69-3.49; P = .28). CONCLUSIONS: Open diseaseD000094624 repair can be performed with similar operative outcomes in 9606 with and without diseaseD008382 despite differing risk profiles. Operative/perioperative strategies must be tailored to specific needs of each 9606 to optimize outcomes.

35863645		Strategies for Treatment of diseaseD002532 Without Intraoperative Adjuncts.BACKGROUND: Although fairly rare, diseaseD002532 are well known to occur in certain conditions such as diseaseD001165, diseaseD001017, diseaseD012078, diseaseD007690, as well as connective tissue disorders (such as diseaseD004535, diseaseD008382, and diseaseD005352). Increased incidence of complications of surgery in such situations is expected to be more likely than in surgery for a single diseaseD000783, particularly in the absence of intraoperative guidance with adjuncts. METHODS: We report a case of an diseaseD002532, a right diseaseD002532, and a right diseaseD000783 in a 70-year-old man. All 3 diseaseD000783 were clipped through a single-stage approach without the aid of any adjuncts such as micro-Doppler ultrasonography, chemicalD007208 videoangiography, or intraoperative digital subtraction angiography. We carried out a literature review for past publications on similar reports. RESULTS: The 9606 made a complete postoperative recovery and sustained no diseaseD009461. Out of 388 publications from the literature search, only 1 case report described clipping of 2 tandem diseaseD000783 in a 60-year-old 9606 without mentioning any intraoperative adjuncts. CONCLUSIONS: This case illustrates that multiple diseaseD000783 can actually be safely operated with adequate planning in the absence of these adjuncts, especially in resource-poor regions. This is particularly crucial in Africa and most low-and-middle-income countries, where such facilities and equipment are not common.

36579861		Twenty-year experience of aortic valve reimplantation using the Valsalva graft.OBJECTIVES: Over the past 20 years, valve-sparing aortic root replacement has aroused increasing interest because of a progressive attitude towards the preservation of natural tissue. Aortic reimplantation is the most used technique to spare the valve, allowing simultaneously aortic root replacement and aortic annular stabilization. The reimplantation into a graft with sinuses guarantees an optimal anatomic and functional reconstruction with established good results at 15 years. The aim of this study is to report the world longest follow-up (up to 20 years) of aortic valve reimplantation using the Valsalva graft. METHODS: From February 2000 to December 2021, 265 consecutive 9606 with diseaseD000094628 received aortic valve reimplantation using the Valsalva graft. From 2018, leaflet plication with the routine use of calliper was performed. For each 9606, we performed both intraoperative and post-procedural transoesophageal echocardiography. All 9606 were followed with clinical assessment and echocardiography. The mean duration of follow-up was 85 +- 63 months. RESULTS: The study cohort had a median age of 55 +- 18 and 87.2% were male. The diseaseD000094628 was associated to diseaseD000082882 in 18.9% of 9606 and to diseaseD008382 in 10.6% of cases. 55.9% had an diseaseD001022 >= 2+. Overall survival at 15 was 87.6 +- 3.4. Freedom from diseaseD003643 was stable at 99.6 +- 0.4 at 5, 10 and 15 years. Freedom from recurrent diseaseD013734 >=3+ and freedom from reoperation remained stable at 10 and 15 years at 92.2 +- 2.1 and 95.9 +- 1.6, respectively. There was a minimal incidence of diseaseD004696 (0.8%), diseaseD013923 (2.2%) and diseaseD006470 (2.0%). Six out of 7 9606 requiring reoperation had surgery in the first period of our experience (last in 2004). Early suboptimal results had a negative effect on residual diseaseD001022. Moreover, we hypothesized that the routine use of calliper may have contributed to a further improvement of the outcome, even if these data need to be confirmed by a longer follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The first long-term follow-up after aortic valve reimplantation using the Valsalva graft demonstrated excellent results. These long-term results gradually improved with learning curve, remaining stable during the second decade of observation. The systematic use of calliper may have contributed to a further improvement of the outcome.

Harvested aortic walls were examined by pathologists. Although the tunica media of the ascending aorta contained aligned diseaseD000071075, the aortic root media lacked aligned diseaseD000071075.
37840436	Association|diseaseD008382|ncbi2200	A novel de novo intragenic duplication in ncbi2200 associated with early-onset diseaseD008382 in a 16-month-old: A case report and review of the literature.diseaseD008382 (diseaseD008382) is an diseaseD003240 due to pathogenic variants in ncbi2200 (ncbi2200) affecting nearly one in every 10,000 individuals. We report a 16-month-old female with early-onset diseaseD008382 heterozygous for an 11.2 kb de novo duplication within the ncbi2200 gene. Tandem location of the duplication was further confirmed by optical genome mapping in addition to genetic sequencing and chromosomal microarray. This is the third reported case of a large multi-exon duplication in ncbi2200, and the only one confirmed to be in tandem. As the vast majority of pathogenic variants associated with diseaseD008382 are point mutations, this expands the landscape of known ncbi2200 pathogenic variants and supports consistent use of genetic testing strategies that can detect large, indel-type variants.
35908146		Surgical outcome of diseaseD012600 in 9606 with diseaseD008382.PURPOSE: To evaluate clinical and radiographic outcomes after surgical diseaseD012600 correction and posterior instrumented fusion in SMF 9606. METHODS: A single-center medical database was reviewed to identify MF 9606 who presented with diseaseD012600 from 2000 to 2015. 9606 who underwent spinal fusion surgery were included. Demographic, operative and clinical data were reviewed, and the preoperative, postoperative, and latest follow-up radiographic parameters were compared. RESULTS: Twelve 9606 were identified (2 males, 10 females) with an average age at surgery of 14.4 +- 2.6 years. Comorbidities were found in 84.6%. Most 9606 (90.9%) presented with a right thoracic curve. The average preoperative Cobb angle was 75.6 +- 15.5 degrees. Posterior instrumented spinal fusion was performed in all 9606 (1 hook/pedicular screw and 11 pedicle screws only). The average follow-up period was 6.8 +- 3.1 years. The mean postoperative Cobb angle after surgery and at the final follow-up was 33.4 +- 18.0 degrees and 35.5 +- 18.4 degrees, respectively. There was a statistically significant difference among the preoperative and postoperative Cobb angles (p < 0.001), but no significant difference among the sagittal angles. Two diseaseD008107 including superficial diseaseD014946 and broken rods were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Posterior diseaseD012600 correction and instrumented spinal fusion resulted in a satisfactory outcome in MF 9606. diseaseD008107 are not uncommon; however, no diseaseD002493 or diseaseD006333 was observed in this study. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV.
35550817		Prevalence and Outcomes of Primary diseaseD018487 in diseaseD008382.Even in the absence of significant diseaseD006349, 9606 with diseaseD008382 (diseaseD008382) have evidence of diseaseD018487, suggestive of a primary diseaseD009202. However, the true prevalence and long-term outcomes of this disease process remain largely unknown. We performed a retrospective analysis of all adult 9606 with confirmed diseaseD008382 followed at Stanford Health Care. Those with significant diseaseD006349, diseaseD003324, or previous cardiac surgery were excluded. diseaseD018487 was defined as a LV ejection fraction (LVEF) <55% on transthoracic echocardiography. A total of 753 9606 with confirmed diseaseD008382 were followed up over a median duration of 8 years (interquartile range 4 to 13). Of those, 241 9606 (53% 9606, 71% White) met inclusion criteria and comprised the study cohort. diseaseD018487 was present in 30 9606 (12%), with a median age of onset of 25 years (interquartile range 19 to 37), median EF of 52% (interquartile range 48 to 54), and evidence of clinical diseaseD006333 (New York Heart Association functional class >=II) in 10% of 9606. diseaseD018487 was more common in 9606 with larger aortic root diameters (>=4.0 cm: Odds ratio = 4.5, 95% confidence interval = 1.2 to 17.1) but was not associated with other cardiovascular manifestations of diseaseD008382 or traditional diseaseD050197 risk factors. In conclusion, apart from significant diseaseD006349, diseaseD018487 was prevalent in diseaseD008382 from a young age, suggestive of a primary diseaseD009202. diseaseD018487 was typically mild and subclinical and occurred more commonly in 9606 with more pronounced aortopathies.

37119066		diseaseD000784 During Pregnancy and Puerperium: Contemporary Incidence and Outcomes in the United States.Background diseaseD000784 (diseaseD000784) during pregnancy and puerperium is a rare catastrophe with devastating consequences for both parent and fetus. Population-level incidence trends and outcomes remain relatively undetermined. Methods and Results We queried a US population-based health care database, the National Inpatient Sample, and identified all 9606 with a pregnancy-related diseaseD000784 hospitalization from 2002 to 2017. In total, 472 pregnancy-related diseaseD000784 hospitalizations (mean age, 30.9+-0.6 years) were identified from 68 514 000 pregnancy-related hospitalizations (0.69 per 100 000 pregnancy-related hospitalizations), with 107 (22.7%) being type A and 365 (77.3%) being type B. The incidence of diseaseD000784 appeared to increase over the 16-year study period but was not statistically significant (P for trend >0.05). diseaseD008382, primary diseaseD006973, and diseaseD011225/diseaseD004461 were found in 21.9%, 14.4%, and 11.5%, respectively. On multivariable logistic regression analysis, diseaseD008382 was associated with the highest risk of developing diseaseD000784 during pregnancy and puerperium (adjusted odds ratio, 3469.36 [95% CI, 1767.84-6831.75]; P<0.001). The in-hospital mortalities of diseaseD000784, diseaseD000784, and diseaseD000784 were 7.3%, 4.3%, and 8.1%, respectively. Length of hospital stay for the diseaseD000784, diseaseD000784, and diseaseD000784 groups were 7.7+-0.8, 10.4+-1.9, and 6.9+-0.9 days, respectively. Conclusions We quantified population-level incidence and in-hospital mortality in the United States and observed an increase in the incidence of pregnancy-related diseaseD000784. In contrast, its in-hospital mortality appears lower than that of non-pregnancy-related diseaseD000784.
38332569		Research Progress on diseaseD000094628.diseaseD000094628 are one of the most common diseaseD000094628, involving the aortic valve, aortic sinus, bilateral coronary arteries, and part of the ascending aorta. It is a life-threatening diseaseD001018 with a high mortality rate of approximately 90%, due to diseaseD001019. diseaseD001022 is one of the most common complications of diseaseD000094628 that can lead to acute diseaseD006333. The etiology of diseaseD000094628 is not yet completely clear and is mainly related to diseaseD030342, such as diseaseD008382 and diseaseD050197. It can also occur secondary to diseaseD001024 or a diseaseD009140. Surgery is the primary treatment for diseaseD000094628, and aortic root replacement is a classic surgical method. However, the incidences of perioperative complications and mortality are relatively high, particularly in high-risk 9606. In recent years, the anatomical structure of the aortic root has been gradually refined, and an in-depth understanding of diseaseD000094628 has led to individualized treatment methods. Conservative drug therapy (ss-receptor blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers), Bentall and modified Bentall surgeries (Button technology, Cabrol surgery, and modified Cabrol surgery), valve-sparing aortic root replacement (David and Yacoub), personalized external aortic root support, and endovascular intervention therapy have significantly improved the perioperative and long-term survival rates of 9606 with diseaseD000094628. However, different treatment methods have their own advantages and disadvantages. This review aimed to summarize the current research progress and treatment of diseaseD000094628.
37330246		Emergency vascular surgical care in populations with unique physiologic characteristics: Pediatric, pregnant, and frail populations.Vascular surgical emergencies are common in vascular surgical care and require complex decision making and multidisciplinary care. They are especially challenging when they occur in 9606 with unique physiological characteristics, such as pediatric, pregnant, and frail 9606. Among the pediatric and pregnant population, diseaseD004630 are rare. This rarity challenges accurate and timely diagnosis of the diseaseD004630. This landscape review summarizes these three unique populations' epidemiology and emergency vascular considerations. Understanding the epidemiology is the foundation for accurate diagnosis and subsequent management. Considering each population's unique characteristics is crucial to the emergent vascular surgical interventions decision making. Collaborative and multidisciplinary care is vital in gaining expertise in managing these special populations and achieving optimal 9606 outcomes.

METHODS: Four male patients with suspected diseaseD008382 and their family members who were treated at West China Second Hospital of Sichuan University from September 12, 2019 to March 27, 2021 were selected as the study subjects. Peripheral venous blood samples were collected from the patients and their parents or other pedigree members for the extraction of genomic DNA. Whole exome sequencing was carried out, and candidate variants were validated by Sanger sequencing. The pathogenicity of the variants was determined based on the guidelines from the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG). RESULTS: Genetic testing revealed that all four patients have harbored variants of the ncbi2200 gene, including variant#2200#c.430_433del (variant#2200#p.H144fsX) deletional variant in exon 5, variantrs113905529## (variant#2200#p.R165*) nonsense variant in exon 6, variant#2200#c.5304_5306del (variant#2200#p.D1768del) deletional variant in exon 44 and variant#5663#c.5165C>G (variant#5663#p.S1722C) missense variant in exon 42. According to the ACMG guidelines, the variant#2200#c.430_433del and variantrs113905529## were classified as pathogenic variants (PVS1+PM2_Supporting+PP4; PVS1+ncbi5663+chemicalC051838+PM2_Supporting+PP4). variant#2200#c.5304_5306del and variant#5663#c.5165C>G were classified as likely pathogenic variants (chemicalC051838+PM2_Supporting+PM4+PP4; chemicalC051838_Moderate+ncbi5663+chemicalC102203+PM2_Supporting). CONCLUSION: The variant#2200#c.430_433del and variant#2200#c.5304_5306del variants of the ncbi2200 gene identified in this study were unreported previously. Above results have enriched the variation spectrum of the ncbi2200 gene and provided a basis for genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis of patients with diseaseD008382 and diseaseC535662.
35388902		Aortic valve reimplantation in 9606 with diseaseD003240: A 15-year follow-up.OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to analyse early- and long-term outcomes of aortic valve reimplantation (David operation) in 9606 with heritable diseaseD013896. METHODS: This is a retrospective observational analysis using data from a prospectively maintained surgical database from March 2004 to April 2021. 9606 with heritable diseaseD013896 were included in the study. RESULTS: A total of 157 9606 with diseaseD000094628 with the diagnosis of heritable diseaseD013896 received the David procedure. diseaseD008382 was found in 143 (91.1%) 9606, diseaseD055947-diseaseD055947 in 13 and diseaseD004535 in 1 9606. The median age was 35.0 (IQR: 17.5) years and the median ascending aorta diameter in the Valsalva sinuses was 48 mm (IQR: 4). A Valsalva graft was used in 8 9606; the David V technique was performed in the rest of the cases. The median follow-up time was 7.3 years [standard deviation: 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI): 6.12-8.05]. Only 2 9606 diseaseD003643 during the follow-up period. The overall survival was 99% (95% CI: 95%; 99%); 98% (95% CI: 92%; 99%); and 98% (95% CI: 92%; 99%) at 5, 10 and 15 years. Freedom from significant diseaseD001022 (diseaseD001022), reintervention and postoperative diseaseD000784 was 90% (95% CI: 77%; 95%), 96% (95% CI: 91%; 99%) and 87% (95% CI: 68%; 95%) at 15 years, respectively. No differences were found in any outcome between diseaseD008382 and diseaseD055947. No statistically significant differences in survival were found when we compared expected gender- and age-specific population survival values. CONCLUSIONS: The David operation is an excellent option for the treatment of 9606 with heritable diseaseD013896 and diseaseD000094628. Surgical expertise in referral centres is essential to achieve the best long-term results.
35360960		Modified Bentall procedure: A 15-year single-center clinical experience.OBJECTIVE: Bentall procedure is a standard technique for complete aortic root replacement but a huge challenge is diseaseD019106. Many modifications have been proposed and the "button technique" is commonly used. With a 15-year experience, this study was to evaluate outcomes of this modified Bentall procedure. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed with all 9606 who underwent the Bentall procedure with a button technique between 2005 and 2020. Commercially available composite grafts were used in 38 9606 and self-assembled composite graft was used in 74 9606. Safety outcome was diseaseD011183 and long-term outcomes included overall and reoperation-free survivals. RESULTS: Among 112 9606, the mean age was 46.3 years and 69.6% were 9606. Indications for the Bentall procedure were ascending diseaseD001014 and diseaseD006349 (59.8%), diseaseD000784 (19.6%), diseaseD008382 (17%), and diseaseD004696 (3.6%). Three 9606 (2.7%) diseaseD003643 in hospital. During a median follow-up period of 42 months, 11 9606 diseaseD003643 and 7 9606 required reoperation. Overall survival and reoperation-free survival were 86.1% and 83.4% at 5 years and 86.1% and 72.6% at 10 years, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The Bentall procedure with a button technique is safe and effective for aortic root replacement. Further investigations are required to improve the feasibility and effectiveness of the procedure.
35512202		Aortic valve reimplantation in 9606 with diseaseD008382 and other connective tissue diseaseD013577: a success story for these 9606!
37860854		The David procedure through a right anterior minithoracotomy.A right anterior minithoracotomy is the least-frequently utilized approach in minimally invasive aortic valve surgery; moreover, this access is rarely used for aortic root procedures. With careful patient selection, some technical considerations, e.g. institution of peripheral cardiopulmonary bypass, and a sufficient learning curve, the right anterior minithoracotomy can become a convenient access for surgical interventions on the aortic root. We present the case of a 31-year-old female patient with diseaseD008382 and severe diseaseD001022 due to an diseaseD000094628. We demonstrate a step-by-step guide through the David procedure via a right anterior minithoracotomy.
37129561		Outcome of diseaseD000784 in 9606 with diseaseD008382.OBJECTIVE: To determine the outcome of diseaseD000784 in 9606 with diseaseD008382 and to evaluate aortic diameters at time of diseaseD000784 as well as the impact of previous aortic root replacement. METHODS: Analysis of all 9606 with diseaseD008382 fulfilling Ghent criteria seen at this institution since 1995 until 2022. RESULTS: Thirty-six (19%) out of 188 9606 with diseaseD008382 suffered from diseaseD000784 during the study period. Mean aortic diameter at time of diseaseD000784 was 39.0 mm (95% CI: 35.6-42.3). Mean pre-diseaseD000784 diameter (available in 25% of 9606) was 32.1 mm (95% CI: 28.0-36.3) and mean expansion was 19% (95% CI: 11.9-26.2). There was no correlation between age and diameter at time of diseaseD000784 (<20, 21-30, 31-40, 41-50, 51-60, <61 years; p = 0.78). Freedom-from-intervention after diseaseD000784 was 53%, 44%, 33% at 1, 5 and 10 years. Aortic growth rate in those 9606 that had to undergo intervention within the 1st year after diseaseD000784 was 10.2 mm/y (95% CI: 4.4-15.9) compared to 5.8 mm/y (95% CI: 3.3-8.3), p = 0.109 in those thereafter. Mean time between diseaseD000784 and intervention was 1.8 years (95% CI: 0.6-3.0). While diseaseD000784 seems more frequent after previous elective aortic repair (58% vs 42%), there was no difference between valve-sparing root replacement (VSRR) compared to Bentall procedures (HR for VSRR 0.78, 95% CI: 0.31-2.0, p-value = 0.61). Mean age of the entire population at end of follow-up was 42 years (95% CI: 39.2-44.7). Mean follow-up time was 9 years (95% CI: 7.8-10.4). CONCLUSIONS: diseaseD000784 in 9606 with diseaseD008382 occurs far below accepted thresholds for intervention. Risk for diseaseD000784 is present throughout lifetime and two third of 9606 need an intervention after diseaseD000784. There is no difference in freedom from diseaseD000784 between a Bentall procedure and a valve-sparing root replacement.
37480997		Thoracic aorta diameters in diseaseD008382 patients: Intraindividual comparison of 3D modified relaxation-enhanced angiography without contrast and triggering (REACT) with transthoracic echocardiography.OBJECTIVE: To compare the measurement of aortic diameters using a novel flow-independent MR-Angiography (3D modified Relaxation-Enhanced Angiography without Contrast and Triggering (modified REACT)) and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) in diseaseD008382 (diseaseD008382) patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective, single-center analysis included 46 examinations of 32 diseaseD008382 patients (mean age 37.5 +- 11.3 years, 17 women, no prior aortic surgery) who received TTE and 3D modified REACT (ECG- and respiratory-triggering, Compressed SENSE factor 9 for acceleration of image acquisition) of the thoracic aorta. Aortic diameters (sinus of Valsalva (SV), sinotubular junction (STJ), and ascending aorta (AoA)) were independently measured by two cardiologists in TTE (leading-edge) and two radiologists in modified REACT (inner-edge, using multiplanar reconstruction). Intraclass correlation coefficient, Bland-Altman analyses, and Pearson's correlation (r) were used to assess agreement between observers and methods. RESULTS: Interobserver correlation at the SV, STJ, and AoA were excellent for both, TTE (ICC = 0.95-0.98) and modified REACT (ICC = 0.99-1.00). There was no significant difference between TTE and modified REACT for diameters measured at the SV (39.24 +- 3.24 mm vs. 39.63 +- 3.76 mm; p = 0.26; r = 0.78) and the STJ (35.16 +- 4.47 mm vs. 35.37 +- 4.74 mm; p = 0.552; r = 0.87). AoA diameters determined by TTE were larger than in modified REACT (34.29 +- 5.31 mm vs. 30.65 +- 5.64 mm; p < 0.01; r = 0.74). The mean scan time of modified REACT was 05:06 min +- 02:47 min, depending on the patient's breathing frequency and heart rate. CONCLUSIONS: Both TTE and modified REACT showed a strong correlation for all aortic levels; however, at the AoA, diameters were larger using TTE, mostly due to the limited field of view of the latter with measurements being closer to the aortic valve. Given the excellent interobserver correlation and the strong agreement with TTE, modified REACT represents an attractive method to depict the thoracic aorta in diseaseD008382 patients.
37866646		Outcomes After Extent I Thoracoabdominal Aortic Repair: Focus on diseaseD065627.BACKGROUND: Crawford extent I diseaseD000094624 (diseaseD000094624) repairs are increasingly performed by an endovascular approach, including in patients with heritable diseaseD013896 (diseaseD065627). We evaluated outcomes after open extent I diseaseD000094624 repair in patients with and without diseaseD065627. METHODS: This retrospective study included 992 patients (median age 67 y [57-73]) who underwent extent I diseaseD000094624 (1990-2022), stratified by the presence of diseaseD065627 (n=177, 17.8%). Patients with diseaseD065627 had either genetic aortopathies or presented at age <=50 years; 35% (62/177) had diseaseD008382. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of operative mortality and adverse event (ie, operative diseaseD003643 or persistent [present at discharge] diseaseD020521, diseaseD010264, diseaseD020335, or diseaseD051437 necessitating dialysis). Long-term outcomes were analyzed with competing risks analysis. RESULTS: Patients with diseaseD065627 had lower operative mortality (1.7% vs 7.0%, P=.01) and adverse event rates (2.8% vs 12.3%, P<.001) than non-diseaseD065627 patients. Most diseaseD065627 patients were discharged home (92.6% vs 76.9%, P<.001). Predictors of operative mortality were increasing age, diseaseD000784, tobacco use, chronic symptoms, and diseaseD012421; predictors for adverse events were increasing age, acute symptoms, chronic diseaseD000784, and diseaseD012421. Patients with diseaseD065627 had substantially better repair-failure-free survival (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Open extent I diseaseD000094624 repair was effective in patients with diseaseD065627, with low operative mortality and adverse event rates, better late survival, and excellent long-term durability, making a compelling argument for preferring open repair in these patients.

However, a significant number of individuals with diseaseD008382 remain genetically unexplained. In this study, we report novel pathogenic intronic variants in ncbi2200 in two unrelated families with diseaseD008382. METHODS: We evaluated subjects with suspected diseaseD008382 from two unrelated families using Sanger sequencing or multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification of ncbi2200 and/or panel-based next-generation sequencing. As no pathogenic variants were identified, whole-genome sequencing was performed. Identified variants were analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR and targeted sequencing of ncbi2200 mRNA harvested from peripheral blood or skin fibroblasts obtained from affected probands. RESULTS: We found causative deep intronic variants, variant#2200#c.6163+1484A>T and variant#2200#c.5788+36C>A, in ncbi2200. The splicing analysis revealed an insertion of in-frame or out-of-frame intronic sequences of the ncbi2200 transcript predicted to alter function of calcium-binding epidermal growth factor protein domain. Family members carrying variant#2200#c.6163+1484A>T had high systemic scores including prominent skeletal features and diseaseD000784 with lesser diseaseD002311. Family members carrying variant#2200#c.5788+36C>A had more severe diseaseD000094628 without diseaseD000784. Both families had diseaseD004479. CONCLUSION: Variable penetrance of the phenotype and negative genetic testing in diseaseD008382 families should raise the possibility of deep intronic ncbi2200 variants and the need for additional molecular studies. This study expands the mutation spectrum of ncbi2200 and points out the importance of intronic sequence analysis and the need for integrative functional studies in diseaseD008382 diagnosis.
36745849		Predicting axial length in 9606 with diseaseD008382 and diseaseD004479 after modified capsular tension ring and intraocular lens implantation.PURPOSE: To predict the growth of axial length (AL) in 9606 with diseaseD008382 (diseaseD008382) and diseaseD004479 (diseaseD004479). SETTING: Eye and ENT Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China. DESIGN: Consecutive retrospective case series. METHODS: Eyes were evaluated that had modified capsular tension ring and intraocular lens implantation. The rate of axial length growth (RALG) was calculated using AL divided by log10-transformed age. A multivariable linear regression model of RALG was developed after validation. RESULTS: A total of 128 9606 with diseaseD008382 (diseaseD008382) and diseaseD004479 were enrolled with a median follow-up duration of about three years. RALG was independent of age between 3 to 15 years old ( P = 0.799) and decreased to zero thereafter ( P = 0.878). Preoperative AL was associated with RALG in 9606 under 15 years old ( P = 0.003). Beta values for the final model of RALG were as below: intercept (-9.794) and pre-operative AL (0.664). The postoperative AL was predicted as: postAL = preAL + RALG x log 10 ((postAge + 0.6) / (preAge + 0.6)). The mean prediction error was -0.003 (95%CI, -0.386, 0.3791) mm and the mean absolute percentage error was 1.93% (95%CI, 0.73%, 3.14%). A Python-based calculator was developed to use the predicted AL in selecting IOL power and setting undercorrection. CONCLUSIONS: The AL growth of 9606 with diseaseD008382 followed a logarithmic pattern and ceased at about age 15. A prediction model of postoperative AL was established for individual diseaseD008382 9606 between 3-15 years old, which could potentially optimize the IOL power selection.
36948371		Morphometric assessment of the ciliary body in 9606 with diseaseD008382 and diseaseD004479: A quantitative study using ultrasound biomicroscopy: Ciliary body morphology in diseaseD008382 and diseaseD004479.PURPOSE: To explore the biometric characteristics of the ciliary body in 9606 with diseaseD008382 (diseaseD008382) and diseaseD004479 (diseaseD004479). DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: Seventy-two consecutive diseaseD008382 9606 with diseaseD004479 and 72 non-disease controls were recruited. Ciliary body biometric parameters such as ciliary muscle cross-sectional area at 2000 mum from the scleral spur (CMA2000), ciliary muscle thickness at 1000 mum from the scleral spur (CMT1000), and maximum ciliary body thickness (CBTmax) were measured from multiple directions with ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM). The relationship between ciliary body parameters and other ocular characteristics was also evaluated. RESULTS: Average CMA2000, CMT1000, and CBTmax were 0.692 +- 0.015 mm2, 0.405 +- 0.010 mm, and 0.855+-0.023 mm in diseaseD008382 eyes, respectively, and were significantly smaller than controls (all p < 0.001). The prevalence of ciliary body thinning was 22.2% in the diseaseD008382 group versus 0 in controls (p < 0.001); eyes with more severe diseaseD004479 had smaller CMA2000 (p = 0.050), thinner CMT1000 (p = 0.022) and shorter CBTmax (p = 0.015). 9606 with diseaseC563255 (diseaseC563255) had even smaller CMA2000 (p = 0.033) and CMT1000 (p = 0.044) than those without diseaseC563255. The most common subluxation direction was in the superonasal quadrant (25, 39.7%), which probably correlates with the thinnest CMT1000 in the inferotemporal quadrant (p = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: diseaseD008382 9606 with diseaseD004479 had thinner ciliary muscles, shorter ciliary processes, and a higher prevalence of ciliary body thinning, especially those with diseaseC563255. Both the extent and direction of subluxation were associated with ciliary body biometry.
37241174		diseaseD008382 beyond Aortic Root-Phenotyping Using Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Clinical Implications.diseaseD008382 (diseaseD008382) is an diseaseC535910 with multiorgan involvement including musculoskeletal, respiratory, cardiovascular, ocular, and skin manifestations. Life expectancy in 9606 with diseaseD008382 is primarily determined by the degree of cardiovascular involvement. diseaseD001018 is the major cardiovascular manifestation of diseaseD008382. However, non-aortic diseaseD006331, such as diseaseD003072 and diseaseD001145, have been increasingly acknowledged as additional causes of morbidity and mortality. We present two cases demonstrating the phenotypical variation in 9606 with diseaseD008382 and how CMR (Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance) could serve as a "one stop shop" to retrieveS all the necessary information regarding aortic/vascular pathology as well as any potential underlying arrhythmogenic substrate or diseaseD044542 process.
36565741	Association|chemicalD009569|diseaseD014652; Negative_Correlation|chemicalD000077333|diseaseD008382	Heterogenous improvements in endothelial function by sub-blood pressure lowering doses of ARBs result in major anti-diseaseD000094628 effects.Low basal chemicalD009569 (NO) production is associated with a dysfunctional endothelium and diseaseD014652. We have shown that some ncbi185 (ncbi185) blockers (ARBs), a group of clinic-approved blood pressure (BP)-lowering medications, are also capable of activating endothelial function acutely and chronically, both ex vivo and in vivo, in pleiotropic, AngII-independent fashions, which suggested that endothelial function enhancement with ARBs may be independent of their well-documented BP lowering properties. Herein, we attempt to identify the most potent ARB at activating endothelial function when administered at sub-BP-lowering doses and determine its anti-diseaseD000094628 properties in a model of diseaseD008382 (diseaseD008382). Amongst the 8 clinically available ARBs tested, only chemicalD000077333 and chemicalC521273 induced significant (70% and 49%, respectively) NO-dependent inhibition of aortic contractility when administered for 4 weeks at sub-BP lowering, EC5 doses. Low-dose chemicalD000077333 (0.47 mg/kg) attenuated diseaseD008382-associated aortic root widening, medial thickening, and elastic fiber fragmentation to the same degree as high-dose chemicalD000077333 (10 mg/kg) despite wide differences in BP lowering between the two doses. Our study suggests that chemicalD000077333 is the most potent ARB at promoting increased endothelial function at low sub-BP doses and that it retained major aortic root widening inhibition activities. ARBs may enhance endothelial function independently from BP-lowering pathways, which could lead to new therapeutic approaches.

Previous research found that pathogenic variants clustered in exons 24-32 of ncbi2200 (ncbi2200) gene result in more severe clinical phenotypes. Furthermore, genotype-phenotype correlation studies suggested that more severe cardiovascular phenotypes were related to variants held responsible for haploinsufficiency. Our objective was to analyze the differences in clinical manifestations and genotypes of individuals with early-onset diseaseD008382 and to assess their impact on management strategies. METHODS: We analyzed clinical and genetic data of a new patient with early-onset diseaseD008382 together with 51 previously reported ones in the PubMed database between 1991 and 2022. RESULTS: Analysis showed 94% (49/52) of pathogenic variants clustered in exons 24-32 of the ncbi2200. The most common skeletal features were diseaseD054119 (98%), diseaseD000092464 (48%), diseaseD066166 (40%), and diseaseD012600 (39%). Haploinsufficiency variants were reported as having poor outcome in 87.5% of the cases. Among patients carrying variants that substitute a chemicalD003545 for another amino acid and those that do not change chemicalD003545 content, cardiac intervention was found to be associated with a better outcome (p = 0.035 vs. p = 0.002). Variants that create an extra chemicalD003545 residue were found to be associated with a higher risk of diseaseD004479. Additionally, children up to 36-months-old were more often reported as still alive at the time of publication compared to newborns (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings have implications for prognosis, because different genotype groups and their resulting phenotype may require personalized care and management.
35318224		Ocular morbidity in diseaseD008382: a nationwide epidemiological study.BACKGROUND: Ophthalmic complications are profound in diseaseD008382 (diseaseD008382). However, the overall burden is not well described. Our purpose was to evaluate the ocular morbidity in a nationwide perspective. METHODS: We identified the ocular morbidity in 9606 with diseaseD008382 (n=407) by use of Danish national healthcare registers, using number and timing of hospital contacts related to ophthalmic diagnoses, to ophthalmic surgery and to prescriptions for ophthalmic medication. An age-matched and gender-matched background population (n=40 700) was used as comparator. RESULTS: Among diseaseD008382, 56% (226/407) of the 9606 had at least one registration of an ophthalmic diagnosis as inpatient or 9606 during the study period (HR of 8.0 (95% CI 7.0 to 9.2)). Seven out of 11 main groups of diagnoses were affected, including 'Lens', 'Choroid and retina', 'Ocular muscles, binocular movement, accommodation and refraction', 'diseaseD005901', diseaseD014786', 'Vitreous body and globe', and 'diseaseD015422, iris and ciliary body'. The number of surgical procedures as well as the use of ophthalmic medication in 9606 with diseaseD008382 was significantly increased. CONCLUSION: This nationwide epidemiological study of ocular morbidity in diseaseD008382 demonstrates a profound burden and emphasises the need for thorough and experienced ophthalmological surveillance.
35305695		The impact of age in diseaseD000094683: a retrospective study.BACKGROUND: diseaseD000094683 (diseaseD000094683) is a lethal disease and age is an important risk factor for outcomes. This retrospective study was to analyze the impact of age stratification in diseaseD000094683, and to provide clues for surgeons when they make choices of therapy strategies. METHODS: From January 2011 to December 2019, 1092 diseaseD000094683 9606 from Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital received surgical therapy. 9606 were divided into 7 groups according to every ten-year interval (20-80 s). The differences between the groups were analyzed in terms of the baseline preoperative conditions, surgical methods and postoperative outcomes of 9606 of different age groups. During a median follow-up term of 17 months, the survival rates were compared among 7 groups through Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS: The median age was 52.0 years old in whole cohort. The multiple comorbidities were more common in old age groups (60 s, 70 s, 80 s), while the 20 s group 9606 had the highest proportion of diseaseD008382 (28.1%). Preoperative diseaseD007022 was highest in 80 s (16.7%, P = 0.038). Young age groups (20-60 s) had a higher rate of root replacement and total arch replacement, which led to a longer duration of operation and diseaseD009360 arrest. The overall mortality was 14.1%, the tendency of mortality was increased with age except 20 s group (33.3% in 80 s, P = 0.016). The postoperative morbidity of diseaseD006471 and diseaseD007511 were 16.7% and 11.1% in 80 s group. CONCLUSIONS: Age is a major impact factor for diseaseD000094683 surgery. Old 9606 presented more comorbidities before surgery, the mortality and complications rate were significantly higher even with less invasive and conservative surgical therapy. But the favorable long-term survival indicated that the simple or less extensive arch repair is the preferred surgery for 9606 over 70 years old.
36556976		Combined Bentall and Modified Ravitch Procedures: A Case Report and Systematic Review of the Evidence.Background and Objectives: diseaseD008382 (diseaseD008382) is a diseaseD030342 with autosomal dominant inheritance that affects the connective tissue and consequently many organ systems. The cardiovascular manifestations of diseaseD008382 are notorious and include diseaseD000094628 or acute diseaseD000784, which can cause morbidity and early mortality. However, surgical treatment of diseaseD005598 may be complicated by diseaseD009140 of the chest wall, as in diseaseD005660. In this regard, single-stage combined Bentall and Ravitch surgery is an extreme rarity that has also been scarcely reported in the literature. 9606 and Methods: We present the medical history and single-stage Bentall and modified Ravitch surgical treatment of an 18-year-old male diseaseD008382 9606 with symptomatic and severe diseaseD005660 (diseaseD005660) in conjunction with a pear-shaped diseaseD000094628. To discuss our case in the context of a synopsis of similar published cases, we present a systematic review of combined Bentall surgical diseaseD001014 repair and Ravitch correction of diseaseD005660. Results: A total of four studies (one case series and three case reports) and a case from our institution describing a single-stage combined Bentall and Ravitch operation were included. 9606 were 22 +- 5.9 years of age (median = 22.5 years) and predominantly male (60%). All cases reported a midline vertical skin incision over the sternum. The most common surgical approach was midsternotomy (80%). In all cases metal struts were used to reinforce the corrected chest wall. Postoperative mortality was zero. Conclusions: Single-stage combined Bentall and Ravitch surgery is an underutilized surgical approach. Its use in diseaseD008382 9606 with concomitant diseaseD005660 and diseaseD000094625 that require surgical treatment warrants further investigation. Midsternotomy seems to be a viable access route that provides sufficient exposure in the single-stage surgical setting. Although operative time is long, the intraoperative and postoperative risks appear to be low and manageable.
36099351		Genetic of diseaseD017545The diseaseD017545 corresponds to the dilation of the ascending part of the aorta, which can lead to a diseaseD000784 (TAAD for diseaseD000784) or diseaseD001019. The etiologies are diverse, but in approximately 20% of cases a genetic origin is found. About thirty genes are reported to be responsible for the development of TAAD. The majority of these genes encode for proteins involved in the extracellular matrix, the contraction of smooth muscle cells or the growth factor ncbi7040 signaling pathway. Identifying the pathogenic variant responsible for the diseaseD001018 becomes essential to make a definitive diagnosis, to guide and to personalize the treatment of the 9606 but also to screen relatives at risk. The availability and access to genetic testing have improved considerably with the development of new sequencing techniques (NGS for Next Generation Sequencing) and the use of gene panels. This review summarizes the main genes associated with TAAD as well as the current diagnostic strategy.
36055553		Midterm outcomes of isolated diseaseD013896 in congenital versus degenerative aortopathy in a 15-year institutional cohort.BACKGROUND: Open diseaseD001018 replacement represents the only approved option to address diseaseD013896 among 9606 with diseaseD003240 (diseaseD003240). The aim of our study was to investigate contemporary midterm outcomes of isolated diseaseD013896 in 9606 with diseaseD003240 versus degenerative pathology in a large institutional cohort. METHODS: All 9606 undergoing isolated open diseaseD013896 at a single academic center from 2005 to 2020 were included. 9606 were classified as having diseaseD003240 or not having diseaseD003240 based on documented genetic mutations associated with diseaseD008209. In-hospital and midterm outcomes, including mortality, diseaseD010264, development of new arterial pathology on surveillance imaging, and the need for future operations, were compared between groups using descriptive statistics and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. RESULTS: Overall, 62 9606 were included with a median follow-up of 58 months (range, 19-81 months) (59 months for those with diseaseD003240 vs 51.5 months for those without diseaseD003240). diseaseD003240 was present in 18 9606 (29%), with 16 having diseaseD008382 (77.8%). 9606 with diseaseD003240 were younger than 9606 without diseaseD003240 (45.8 years vs 60.9 years) and had lower rates of smoking (5.6% vs 56.8%) and diseaseD006973 (97.7% vs 72.2%; all P < .01). 9606 with diseaseD003240 were more likely to have a dissection component at the time of repair compared with 9606 without diseaseD003240 (100% vs 59.1%) and underwent repair at smaller diseaseD001018 diameters (5.9 cm vs 6.6 cm; both P < .05). There were no differences in in-hospital outcomes between the two groups, including mortality (4.5% vs 5.6%) and diseaseD010264 (2.3% vs 0%; both P > .05). At 5 years, 9606 with diseaseD003240 were more likely to have developed diseaseD000783 changes distal to their thoracic repair (88.9% vs 47.7%) and diseaseD001014 (41.2% vs 2.3%; both P < .05). However, on survival analysis, there were no differences in freedom from additional vascular procedures (hazard ratio,1.76; P = .333) or, specifically, additional diseaseD001018 procedures (hazard ratio, 1.81; P = .380) between the two groups. There was only one diseaseD057868 identified on longitudinal follow-up, which occurred in a 9606 without diseaseD003240 8 years after the index operation. CONCLUSIONS: Although carrying significant operative risks and the potential for morbidity, open diseaseD013896 represents a well-tolerated, durable treatment option for 9606 with congenitally mediated diseaseD013896. Because both 9606 with and without diseaseD003240 who required diseaseD013896 often need future diseaseD001018 intervention, vigilant surveillance is warranted. Equivalent intervention rates between the two groups suggest remodeling of the diseaseD003240 aorta is almost universally characterized by initial postrepair dilation, but the majority of these changes successfully stabilize and do not progress to higher rates of intervention.
37046157		Extended law of laplace for measurement of the cloverleaf anatomy of the aortic root.The cross-sectional shape of the aortic root is cloverleaf, not circular, raising controversy regarding how best to measure its radiographic "diameter" for aortic event prediction. We mathematically extended the law of Laplace to estimate aortic wall stress within this cloverleaf region, simultaneously identifying a new metric of aortic root dimension that can be applied to clinical measurement of the aortic root and sinuses of Valsalva on clinical computerized tomographic scans. Enforcing equilibrium between blood pressure and wall stress, finite element computations were performed to evaluate the mathematical derivation. The resulting Laplace diameter was compared with existing methods of aortic root measurement across four 9606 groups: non-syndromic diseaseD000783, diseaseD000082882, diseaseD008382, and non-dilated root 9606 (total 106 9606, 62 M, 44 F). (1) Wall stress: Mean wall stress at the depth of the sinuses followed this equation: Wall stress = BP x Circumscribing circle diameter/(2 x Aortic wall thickness). Therefore, the diameter of the circle enclosing the root cloverleaf, that is, twice the distance between the center, where the sinus-to-commissure lines coincide, and the depth of the sinuses, may replace diameter in the Laplace relation for a cloverleaf cross-section (or any shaped cross-section with two or more planes of symmetry). This mathematically derived result was verified by computational finite element analyses. (2) Diameters: CT scan measurements showed a significant difference between this new metric, the Laplace diameter, and the sinus-to-commissure, mid-sinus-to-mid-sinus, and coronal measurements in all four groups (p-value < 0.05). The average Laplace diameter measurements differed significantly from the other measurements in all 9606 groups. Among the various possible measurements within the aortic root, the diameter of the circumscribing circle, enclosing the cloverleaf, represents the diameter most closely related to wall stress. This diameter is larger than the other measurements, indicating an underestimation of wall stress by prior measurements, and otherwise provides an unbiased, convenient, consistent, physics-based measurement for clinical use. "Diameter" applies to circles. Our mathematical derivation of an extension of the law of Laplace, from circular to cloverleaf cross-sectional geometries of the aortic root, has implications for measurement of aortic root "diameter." The suggested method is as follows: (1) the "center" of the aortic root is identified by drawing three sinus-to-commissure lines. The intersection of these three lines identifies the "center" of the cloverleaf. (2) The largest radius from this center point to any of the sinuses is identified as the "radius" of the aortic root. (3) This radius is doubled to give the "diameter" of the aortic root. We find that this diameter best corresponds to maximal wall stress in the aortic root. Please note that this diameter defines the smallest circle that completely encloses the cloverleaf shape, touching the depths of all three sinuses.
36722594		Difficult ventilation in a 9606 with a diseaseC565758: A challenge for the anesthesiologist.9606 with diseaseD008382 present anatomic variations that may increase the risk of a difficult airway. Moreover, they can present large diseaseD001014, which may cause extrinsic airway compression. Therefore, difficult ventilation during general anesthesia poses a challenge in that the anesthesiologist has to promptly make a crucial differential diagnosis. Multidisciplinary preoperative assessment and planning of the airway and ventilation management are of utmost importance in such uncommon and highly complex clinical cases. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy is probably a really useful tool in order to assess the severity and extent of the airway compression, both preoperatively and intraoperatively. We present a clinical case where difficult ventilation occurred immediately after the induction of general anesthesia.
37314760		Outcomes After Endovascular Aortic Intervention in 9606 With diseaseD003240.Importance: Endovascular treatment is not recommended for aortic pathologies in 9606 with diseaseD003240 (diseaseD003240) other than in redo operations and as bridging procedures in emergencies. However, recent developments in endovascular technology may challenge this dogma. Objective: To assess the midterm outcomes of endovascular aortic repair in 9606 with CTD. Design, Setting, and Participants: For this descriptive retrospective study, data on demographics, interventions, and short-term and midterm outcomes were collected from 18 aortic centers in Europe, Asia, North America, and New Zealand. 9606 with CTD who had undergone endovascular aortic repair from 2005 to 2020 were included. Data were analyzed from December 2021 to November 2022. Exposure: All principal endovascular aortic repairs, including redo surgery and complex repairs of the aortic arch and visceral aorta. Main Outcomes and Measures: Short-term and midterm survival, rates of secondary procedures, and conversion to open repair. Results: In total, 171 9606 were included: 142 with diseaseD008382, 17 with diseaseD055947, and 12 with diseaseD000094623 (diseaseD000094623). Median (IQR) age was 49.9 years (37.9-59.0), and 107 9606 (62.6%) were male. One hundred fifty-two (88.9%) were treated for diseaseD000784 and 19 (11.1%) for diseaseD019636. One hundred thirty-six 9606 (79.5%) had undergone open aortic surgery before the index endovascular repair. In 74 9606 (43.3%), arch and/or visceral branches were included in the repair. Primary technical success was achieved in 168 9606 (98.2%), and 30-day mortality was 2.9% (5 9606). Survival at 1 and 5 years was 96.2% and 80.6% for diseaseD008382, 93.8% and 85.2% for diseaseD055947, and 75.0% and 43.8% for diseaseD000094623, respectively. After a median (IQR) follow-up of 4.7 years (1.9-9.2), 91 9606 (53.2%) had undergone secondary procedures, of which 14 (8.2%) were open conversions. Conclusions and Relevance: This study found that endovascular aortic interventions, including redo procedures and complex repairs of the aortic arch and visceral aorta, in 9606 with CTD had a high rate of early technical success, low perioperative mortality, and a midterm survival rate comparable with reports of open aortic surgery in 9606 with CTD. The rate of secondary procedures was high, but few 9606 required conversion to open repair. Improvements in devices and techniques, as well as ongoing follow-up, may result in endovascular treatment for 9606 with CTD being included in guideline recommendations.

36097197		Discrepancy of echocardiography and computed tomography in initial assessment and 2-year follow-up for monitoring diseaseD008382 and related disorders.9606 with diseaseD008382 and related disorders are at risk for diseaseD000784 and diseaseD001019 and therefore require appropriate monitoring. Computed tomography (CT) and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) are routinely used for initial diagnosis and follow-up. The purpose of this study is to compare whole-heart CT and TTE aortic measurement for initial work-up, 2-year follow-up, and detection of progressive diseaseD006529. This retrospective study included 95 9606 diagnosed with diseaseD008382 or a related disorder. All 9606 underwent initial work-up including aortic diameter measurement using both electrocardiography-triggered whole-heart CT and TTE. Forty-two of these 9606 did not undergo aortic repair after initial work-up and were monitored by follow-up imaging within 2 years. Differences between the two methods for measuring aortic diameters were compared using Bland-Altman plots. The acceptable clinical limit of agreement (acLOA) for initial work-up, follow-up, and progression within 2 years was predefined as <  +- 2 mm. Bland-Altman analysis revealed a small bias of 0.2 mm with wide limits of agreement (LOA) from + 6.3 to - 5.9 mm for the aortic sinus and a relevant bias of - 1.6 mm with wide LOA from + 5.6 to - 8.9 mm for the ascending aorta. Follow-up imaging yielded a small bias of 0.5 mm with a wide LOA from + 6.7 to - 5.8 mm for the aortic sinus and a relevant bias of 1.1 mm with wide LOA from + 8.1 to - 10.2 mm for the ascending aorta. Progressive diseaseD006529 at follow-up was detected in 57% of 9606 using CT and 40% of 9606 using TTE. Measurement differences outside the acLOA were most frequently observed for the ascending aorta. Whole-heart CT and TTE measurements show good correlation, but the frequency of measurement differences outside the acLOA is high. TTE systematically overestimates aortic diameters. Therefore, whole-heart CT may be preferred for aortic monitoring of 9606 with diseaseD008382 and related disorders. TTE remains an indispensable imaging tool that provides additional information not available with CT.

38363416		Longitudinal changes of diseaseD012030 in preschool children with diseaseD004479.BACKGROUND: diseaseD004479 (diseaseD004479) is a diseaseD015785 which severely impacts preschool children's visual function and development. This study aimed to evaluate the longitudinal changes in spherical equivalent (SE) diseaseD012030 in preschool children with diseaseD004479. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted at Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Guangzhou, China. Medical records of diseaseD004479 9606 under 6-year-old who were diagnosed with diseaseD008382 at the initial visit from January 2014 to March 2022 were collected and were divided into surgery and non-surgery groups. Mean change rate of SE in the two groups was evaluated, and the potential associated factors of SE change rate were investigated by mixed-effect regression model. RESULTS: A total of 94 preschool 9606 from 14 provinces of China were included. Among the 42 children of the surgery group, the mean age with standard deviation (SD) was 5.02 +- 0.81 years and 9606 experienced a diseaseD001251 shift of -0.05 +- 0.09 D/month in average. The mean age with SD of the 52 children of the non-surgery group was 4.34 +- 1.02 years, and the mean diseaseD001251 shift was -0.09 +- 0.14 D/month. The mixed-effect regression model identified that higher degree of diseaseD009216 at baseline was associated with slower diseaseD001251 shift both in surgery (beta = 0.901, 95% CI: 0.822 ~ 0.980, P < 0.001) and in non-surgery group (beta = 1.006, 95% CI: 0.977 ~ 1.034, P < 0.001) in diseaseD004479 9606. Surgical treatment (beta = 2.635, 95% CI: 1.376 ~ 3.894, P < 0.001) was associated with slower diseaseD001251 shift in all participants diseaseD004479 9606. CONCLUSIONS: diseaseD001251 progression was slower in the surgery group than in the non-surgery group of diseaseD004479. Preschool diseaseD004479 9606 who met the surgical indication are suggested being performed with timely surgery to slow down the diseaseD001251 progression.
37301538		Acute three-channeled diseaseD000784 of the entire aorta in a 9606 without diseaseD008382 detected by transesophageal echocardiography and computed tomography.
37160424		Longitudinal follow-up by MR angiography reveals progressive dilatation of the distal aorta after aortic diseaseD011843 in diseaseD008382.OBJECTIVES: To define and compare growth rates of the distal aorta in diseaseD008382 9606 with and without aortic diseaseD011843 using serial MR angiography (MRA). METHODS: We retrospectively included 136 diseaseD008382 9606 with a total of 645 MRAs who underwent a median of five MRAs (range: 2-13) at 1.5 T and 3 T in annual intervals. Of these, 41 9606 (34.8 +- 12 years) had undergone aortic diseaseD011843. The remaining 95 9606 (29.0 +- 17 years) still had a native aorta and served as the control group. Thoracic aortic diameters were independently measured at eleven predefined levels. Estimated growth rates were calculated using a mixed effects model adjusted for sex, age, BMI, and medication. RESULTS: diseaseD008382 9606 with aortic diseaseD011843 revealed the highest mean estimated growth rate in the proximal descending aorta (0.77 mm/year, CI: 0.31-1.21). Mean growth rates at all levels of the distal thoracic aorta were significantly higher in 9606 with aortic diseaseD011843 (0.28-0.77 mm/year) when compared to 9606 without aortic diseaseD011843 (0.03-0.07 mm/year) (all p < 0.001). Antihypertensive medication, gender, and BMI had no significant impact on the distal aortic growth rates. CONCLUSION: Distal thoracic aortic diameters increase at a significantly higher rate in diseaseD008382 9606 with aortic diseaseD011843 compared to diseaseD008382 9606 without aortic diseaseD011843. Further studies are warranted to investigate if the increased growth rate of the distal thoracic aorta after aortic diseaseD011843 is caused by altered hemodynamics due to the rigid aortic diseaseD011843 graft or due to the general genetic disposition of post-operative diseaseD008382 9606. CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: High growth rates of the distal aorta after aortic diseaseD011843 underline the need for careful life-long aortic imaging of diseaseD008382 9606 after aortic diseaseD011843. KEY POINTS:   Aortic growth rates in diseaseD008382 9606 with aortic diseaseD011843 are highest in the mid-aortic arch, the proximal- and mid-descending aorta.   Growth rates of the distal thoracic aorta are significantly higher in diseaseD008382 9606 with aortic diseaseD011843 compared to diseaseD008382 9606 without aortic diseaseD011843.   Antihypertensive medication, gender, and BMI have no significant impact on distal aortic growth rates in diseaseD008382 9606.

Methods: To determine the etiological role of de novo mutations (DNMs) and genetic profile in diseaseD015785, we retrospectively reviewed a large cohort of proband-parent trios of Chinese origin. The 9606 underwent a detailed examination and was clinically diagnosed by an ophthalmologist. Panel-based targeted exome sequencing was performed on DNA extracted from blood samples, containing coding regions of 792 IED-causative genes and their flanking exons. All participants underwent genetic testing. Results: All proband-parent trios were divided into 22 subgroups, the overall diagnostic yield was 48.67% (605/1243), ranging from 4% to 94.44% for each of the subgroups. A total of 108 IED-causative genes were identified, with the top 24 genes explaining 67% of the 605 genetically solved trios. The genetic etiology of 6.76% (84/1243) of the trio was attributed to disease-causative DNMs, and the top 3 subgroups with the highest incidence of DNM were diseaseD015783 (n = 40%), diseaseD008382/diseaseD004479 (n = 38.78%), and diseaseD012175 (n = 37.04%). The top 10 genes have a diagnostic yield of DNM greater than 3.5% in their subgroups, including ncbi5080 (40.00%), ncbi2200 (38.78%), ncbi5925 (37.04%), ncbi1406 (10.34%), ncbi1121 (9.09%), ncbi7466 (8.00%), ncbi94137 (5.88%), ncbi6247 (5.26%), ncbi65217 (4.00%), and ncbi24 (3.51%). Additionally, the incidence of DNM in offspring showed a trend of correlation with paternal age at reproduction, but not statistically significant with paternal (P = 0.154) and maternal (P = 0.959) age at reproduction. Conclusions: Trios-based genetic analysis has high accuracy and validity. Our study helps to quantify the burden of the full spectrum IED caused by each gene, offers novel potential for elucidating etiology, and plays a crucial role in genetic counseling and 9606 management.
37758246		Early and Long-Term Outcomes of Young Adult Patients <=30 Years Old with Acute diseaseD000784.OBJECTIVES: To investigate the early and long-term outcomes after total arch replacement and frozen elephant trunk implantation in adult patients <=30 years with acute diseaseD000784. METHODS: All young adult patients (<=30 years) with acute diseaseD000784 who underwent total arch replacement and frozen diseaseD016715 trunk between 2009 and 2017 were enrolled. The end-points were major organ morbidity and mortality, aortic-related events, and reoperation. RESULTS: The mean age of all 83 patients was 25.9 (standard deviation, 3.3) years. The in-hospital mortality was 9.64% (8/83), and 9 (10.8%) patients required re-exploration for diseaseD006470. The aortic-related events risk was 42.7% (32/75) and aortic reoperation risk was 17.3% (13/75). Overall survival was 85.5% (95% CI, 75.9%-91.5%) at 5 years and 75.9% (95% CI, 63.3%-84.7%) at 10 years. The cumulative incidence of aortic-related events was 35% (95% CI, 24%-47%) at 5 years and 58% (95% CI, 36%-75%) at 10 years; the cumulative reoperation rate was 15% (95% CI, 7.9%-24%) at 5 years and 17% (95% CI, 9.2%-27%) at 10 years. diseaseD008382 significantly increased the aortic-related events (P = 0.036) and reoperation (P = 0.041) risks. CONCLUSIONS: Despite extensive repair in young acute diseaseD000784 patients, the late aortic diseaseD002311 and reoperation risk remain high. The total arch replacement and frozen diseaseD016715 trunk procedure achieved satisfactory early outcomes and reduced late aortic diseaseD002311 and reoperation in young patients compared with other records. Close follow-up and aggressive early reintervention are essential for patients with aortic-related risk factors early in life.
37913934		Clinical application of four-dimensional flow cardiovascular magnetic resonance in diseaseD008382: A systematic review and meta-analysis.This study aims to fill this gap by assessing the application of 4D flow CMR in diseaseD008382 through a systematic review and meta-analysis. We conducted a comprehensive search of databases from their inception to May 1, 2023. Eligibility criteria were established based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The quality of studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS), with studies scoring above five deemed high quality. Meta-analyses were performed using Stata 15.1 software. Nine studies were analyzed. Findings indicate diseaseD008382 patients had increased vortex flow in the descending aorta (DAo), larger aortic root diameter (ARD) and Z-scores, lower inner wall shear stress (WSS) in the proximal descending aorta (pDAo), reduced in-plane rotational flow (IRF) in the aortic arch and proximal descending aorta (pDAo), and increased pulse wave velocity (PWV) in the ascending aorta (AAo) and DAo compared to healthy subjects. No significant difference in systolic flow reversal ratio was observed. Sensitivity analysis showed no heterogeneity and Egger's test revealed no publication bias. This meta-analysis underscores the effectiveness of 4D flow CMR in detecting diseaseD008382, particularly through indicators such as vortex flow, WSS, IRF, ARD, and PWV. The findings provide insights into diagnosing diseaseD002318 and predicting cardiovascular events in diseaseD008382 patients. Further case-control studies are needed to establish measurement standards and explore potential indicators for improved diagnosis and treatment of diseaseD008382.
35841950		Improved Outcomes of Reimplantation vs Remodeling in diseaseD008382: A Propensity-Matched Study.BACKGROUND: Valve-sparing root replacement (VSRR) has excellent outcomes when performed in experienced centers in well-selected 9606. It is suggested that reimplantation of the aortic valve may have better durability than remodeling in 9606 with diseaseD008382 (diseaseD008382), although long-term comparative data are limited. METHODS: Between 1988 and 2018, 194 9606 with diseaseD008382 underwent VSRR at our institution. From these, we derived a propensity-matched cohort of 68 9606 (44 who underwent reimplantation and 24 who had remodeling). Early outcomes included diseaseD003643 and perioperative complications. Late outcomes were survival, probability of diseaseD001022, and reintervention up to 20 years of follow-up. Median follow-up was 17.8 years (interquartile range, 12.0-20.6 years) for the entire matched cohort. RESULTS: Baseline variables were similar between reimplantation and remodeling 9606 after matching: age (39 +- 12 vs 40 +- 13 years, P = .75) and male sex (28 [64%] vs 15 [63%], P = 1.0). Similar 20-year survival was observed after reimplantation compared with remodeling (82% vs 72%, P = .20), whereas the probability of developing greater than mild diseaseD001022 at 20 years was increased after remodeling (5.8% vs 13%, P = .013). More 9606 underwent reoperation on the aortic valve after a remodeling procedure than after reimplantation of the aortic valve (18% vs 0%, P = .018). CONCLUSIONS: VSRR provides excellent long-term survival and freedom from valve-related complications outcomes in 9606 with diseaseD008382. Reimplantation of the aortic valve was associated with a lower risk of aortic valve reoperation and diseaseD001022 than the remodeling procedure after 2 decades of follow-up.

Notch signaling is essential for vessel morphogenesis and function. However, the role of Notch signaling in aortic pathology and aortic smooth muscle cell (SMC) differentiation in diseaseD008382 (diseaseD008382) is not completely understood. METHODS: RNA-sequencing on ascending aortic tissue from a 10090 model of diseaseD008382, Fbn1mgR/mgR , and wild-type controls was performed. ncbi18131 expression and activation in aortic tissue were confirmed with real-time RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, and Western blot. Fbn1mgR/mgR and wild-type 10090 were treated with a gamma-secretase inhibitor, DAPT, to block Notch activation. diseaseD001019 were evaluated with connective tissue staining, ultrasound, and life table analysis. RESULTS: The 10090 RNA-sequencing data were validated with 10090 and 9606 diseaseD008382 aortic tissue, demonstrating elevated ncbi18131 activation in diseaseD008382. Data further revealed that upregulation and activation of ncbi18131 were concomitant with increased expression of SMC contractile markers. Inhibiting ncbi18131 activation with DAPT attenuated aortic enlargement and improved survival of Fbn1mgR/mgR 10090. DAPT treatment reduced ncbi13717 fiber fragmentation in the aorta and reversed the differentiation of SMCs. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrated that diseaseC535501 in the aorta of diseaseD008382 are associated with increased ncbi18131 activation. Enhanced ncbi18131 activation in diseaseD008382 contributed to diseaseD001014 formation in diseaseD008382. This might be mediated by inducing a contractile phenotypic change of SMC. Our results suggest that inhibiting ncbi18131 activation may provide a strategy to prevent and treat diseaseD001014 in diseaseD008382.
37096976		Bentall Procedure to Repair Acute diseaseD000784 in Pregnant diseaseD008382 9606 With Preservation of Pregnancy.Background: Acute diseaseD000784 is the most common life-threatening disorder classically presenting with tearing diseaseD002637 radiating to the back yet can have deceiving clinical presentations.Case presentation: The 9606 was a 22-year-old pregnant 9606 (gravida 6, para 4, abortion1) at 26 weeks of gestation. She was a known case of diseaseD008382 who developed acute diseaseD000784 during pregnancy. Repair of diseaseD000784 was done through the Bentall procedure with a composite mechanical valved conduit while Fetal heart rate (FHR) was simultaneously monitored during surgery. Three months after surgical repair, the newborn was delivered via cesarean, and both mother and baby survived without any complications.Conclusions: In this case, we demonstrated that repair of diseaseD000784 can be done in pregnant 9606 with preservation of fetus in the uterus through close cooperation among all members of a multi-disciplinary team.
36951534		Acute Type A Aortic diseaseD000784 in Adolescents and Young Adults under 30 Years of Age: Demographics, Etiology and Postoperative Outcomes of 139 cases.BACKGROUND: The prevalence and etiology of acute diseaseD000784 in 9606 <=30 years is unknown. The aims of this clinical study were to determine the prevalence and potential etiology of acute diseaseD000784 in surgically treated 9606 <=30 years and to evaluate the respective postoperative outcomes in this selective group of 9606 in a large multi-centre study. METHODS: Retrospective data collection was performed at the 16 participating international aortic institutions. All 9606 <=30years at the time of diseaseD000784 onset were included. The postoperative results were analysed with regard to diseaseD003240. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of acute diseaseD000784 <= 30years was 1.8% (139 out of 7914 9606), including 51(36.7%) 9606 who were retrospectively diagnosed with diseaseD003240. Cumulative postoperative mortality was 8.6%, 2.2% and 1.4%, respectively. Actuarial survival was 80% at 10 years postoperatively. Non- diseaseD003240 9606 (n = 88) had a significantly higher incidence of diseaseD000081029 (46.6%vs.9.8%;p<0.001) while acute diseaseD000784 affected the aortic root (p < 0.001) and arch (p = 0.029) significantly more often in the diseaseD003240 group. A positive family history of diseaseD001018 was present in 9.4% of the study cohort(n = 13). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of acute diseaseD000784 in surgically treated 9606 <=30 years is less than 2% with diseaseD003240 and diseaseD000081029 as the two most prevalent triggers of acute diseaseD000784 Open surgery may be performed with good early results and excellent mid- to long-term outcomes.

36239929		Endovascular therapy for diseaseD000784 for 9606 with diseaseD008382: systematic review and meta-analysis.INTRODUCTION: The role of thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) in 9606 with diseaseD008382 with diseaseD000784 (diseaseD000784) remains under debate. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched through December 2021 to identify studies that investigated outcomes in diseaseD008382 9606 with diseaseD000784 who underwent TEVAR. Data regarding 9606 characteristics, perioperative and late outcomes were extracted. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Twelve studies were identified including 120 9606. The mean age was 40.2 years (95% confidence interval [CI], 36.8-43.6). 40.4% (95% CI: 10.8-70.0) of cases were performed emergently. 76.2% (95% CI: 64.6-87.8) of 9606 had a history of previous aortic surgery. In-hospital mortality was 3.7% (95% CI: 0.6-6.8). Primary diseaseD057867 occurred in 15.2% (95% CI: 8.6-21.8), which was comprised of type 1 (9.3% [95% CI: 3.9-14.6]) and type 2 (7.1% [95% CI: 2.3-12.0]) diseaseD057867. During mean follow-up period of 37.4 months (95% CI: 24.1-50.7), secondary diseaseD057867 was reported in 14.1% (95% CI: 7.1-21.1), which was comprised of type 1 (7.4% [95% CI: 2.4-12.5]) and type 2 (4.0% [95% CI: 0.3-7.7]) diseaseD057867. Repeat TEVAR was performed in 15.5% (95% CI: 9.3-21.8) and open aortic surgery in 18.6% (95% CI: 9.6-27.5). Long-term mortality was 11.9% (95% CI: 6.5-17.3). CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis showed that TEVAR for diseaseD000784 in 9606 with diseaseD008382 has low perioperative morbidity and mortality but was associated with a high rate of late reintervention. This treatment option should be limited to emergent cases and to 9606 deemed unsuitable for open repair. Lifelong follow-up with imaging is mandatory in this population.
35593622		Management and outcome of diseaseD008382.
37556572		Case of the diseaseD017541: A Report of a Radiographic Stitching Error in a diseaseD012600 Patient.CASE: A 14-year-old boy with diseaseD008382-associated diseaseD012600 underwent postoperative imaging after diseaseD012600 surgery. The lateral radiograph seemingly depicted a diseaseD050815 of the L4 vertebra, despite the patient being asymptomatic. Further investigation with focused lumbar spine films, however, revealed a normal L4 vertebra. The apparent abnormality was attributed to an error in the image merging process. CONCLUSION: Image stitching errors can lead to a false impression of diseaseC566527. It is crucial for radiology technologists and clinicians to exercise caution when reviewing digitally stitched images. We reiterate the recommendation for technicians to label stitched images and indicate overlapping regions, facilitating judicious and accurate radiographic assessment.
35916717		Outcomes of valve-sparing surgery in heritable diseaseD000082862: results from the AVIATOR registry.OBJECTIVES: Root reimplantation has been the favoured approach for 9606 with diseaseD065627 requiring valve-sparring root replacement. In the past few years, diseaseD011843 with annuloplasty has emerged as an alternative to root reimplantation in the general population. The aim of this study was to examine the late outcomes of 9606 with diseaseD065627 undergoing valve-sparring root replacement and compare different techniques. METHODS: Using the AVIATOR registry (diseaseD001022 and ascending aorta diseaseD000783 InternATiOnal Registry), data were collected from 5 North American and European centres. 9606 were divided into 4 groups according to the technique of valve-sparing used (root reimplantation, diseaseD011843 with ring annuloplasty, diseaseD011843 with suture annuloplasty and diseaseD011843 alone). The primary endpoints were freedom from diseaseD001022 (diseaseD001022) >=2 and freedom from reintervention on the aortic valve. Secondary endpoints were survival and changes in annular dimensions over time. RESULTS: A total of 237 9606 were included in the study (reimplantation = 100, remodelling + ring annuloplasty = 76, remodelling + suture annuloplasty = 34, remodelling alone = 27). The majority of 9606 had diseaseD008382 (83%). Preoperative diseaseD001022 >=2 was present in 41% of the 9606. Operative mortality was 0.4% (n = 1). No differences were found between techniques in terms of postoperative diseaseD001022 >=2 (P = 0.58), reintervention (P = 0.52) and survival (P = 0.59). Changes in aortic annulus dimension were significantly different at 10 years (P < 0.05), a difference that started to emerge 4 years after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, valve-sparring root replacement is a safe and durable procedure in 9606 with diseaseD065627. Nevertheless, diseaseD011843 alone is associated with late annular dilatation. The addition of an annuloplasty, however, results in similar freedom from diseaseD001022, reintervention, survival and changes in annulus size compared to reimplantation.
36650042		Matched comparison between external aortic root support and valve-sparing root replacement.OBJECTIVES: Differences in indication and technique make a randomised comparison between valve-sparing root replacement (VSRR) and personalised external aortic root support (PEARS) challenging. We performed a propensity score (PS)-matched comparison of PEARS and VSRR for diseaseD000094628. METHODS: 9606 in the PEARS 200 Database and diseaseD001022 and ascending diseaseD000784 InternATiOnal Registry (undergoing VSRR) with diseaseD003240 operated electively for diseaseD000094628 <60 mm with diseaseD001022 (diseaseD001022) <1/4 were included. Using a PS analysis, 80 9606 in each cohort were matched. Survival, freedom from reintervention and from diseaseD001022 >=2/4 were estimated using a Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 25 and 55 months for 159 PEARS and 142 VSRR 9606. Seven (4.4%) 9606 undergoing PEARS required an intervention for diseaseD003323, resulting in one diseaseD003643 (0.6%). After VSRR, there were no early diseaseD003643, 10 (7%) reinterventions for diseaseD006470 and 1 coronary intervention. Survival for matched cohorts at 5 years was similar (PEARS 98% vs VSRR 99%, p=0.99). There was no difference in freedom from valve or ascending aortic/arch reintervention between matched groups. Freedom from diseaseD001022 >=2/4 at 5 years in the matched cohorts was 97% for PEARS vs 92% for VSRR (p=0.55). There were no type A dissections. CONCLUSIONS: VSRR and PEARS offer favourable mid-term survival, freedom from reintervention and preservation of valve function. Both treatments deserve their place in the surgical repertoire, depending on a 9606's disease stage. This study is limited by its retrospective nature and different follow-ups in both cohorts.
36272618		Current controversies in aortic valve-preserving surgery.The clinical outcome of severe diseaseD001022 (diseaseD001022) remains suboptimal, but surgery has been shown to have survival benefit over medical therapy. Postoperative survival is inferior in 9606 with reduced left ventricular function, and therefore early surgical intervention is recommended. Aortic valvuloplasty (AVP) is an attractive option to avoid the major drawbacks of prosthetic valves but has not been widely adopted. The etiology of diseaseD001022 is classified functionally into three groups: normal leaflet motion (type I), diseaseD011391 (type II), and restriction (type III). Type I with diseaseD002311 (type Ib) can be repaired by aortic valve reimplantation or aortic root remodeling with similar valve stability. Type I with diseaseD002311 (type Ic) can be managed by annuloplasty. Type II can be corrected by plication or resuspension techniques. Pericardial patch is necessary in AVP for type Id (diseaseD057112/fenestration) and type III but is associated with risk of recurrence. diseaseD000082882 is classified according to commissure angle: symmetrical, asymmetrical, and very asymmetrical. Tricuspidization is recommended for repair of very asymmetrical valves to avoid postoperative diseaseD003251. Recent progress has achieved similar reoperation rates between bicuspid and tricuspid aortic valve repair. For diseaseD008382, valve-sparing root replacement is advantageous compared to Bentall operation regarding late survival, diseaseD013923 and diseaseD006470 events, and diseaseD004696. Similar findings have been reported in acute diseaseD000784. Both remodeling and reimplantation procedures provide similar favorable outcomes in these settings. Recent advances in AVP are summarized by quantitative assessment of cusp configuration (effective height and geometric height), graft size decision, use of template to cut the graft, and videoscopic assessment of post-repair cusp configuration. Due to these advances, AVP shows superior results to replacement surgery. Further concrete evidence with larger case volumes and longer observation periods are necessary to popularize AVP.
35883019		Early and midterm results of diseaseD002062 operation with Evita open stent-graft in 9606 with diseaseD008382: results of a multicentre study.BACKGROUND: Endovascular treatment of 9606 with diseaseD008382 (diseaseD008382) is not recommended. Hybrid procedures such as diseaseD002062 (diseaseD002062), which combines stent-graft deployment with an integrated non-stented fabric graft for proximal grafting and suturing, have not been previously evaluated. The aim of this study was to assess the safety and feasibility of diseaseD002062 operation in 9606 with diseaseD008382. METHODS: 9606 enrolled in the International diseaseD016751 Open Registry (IEOR) who underwent diseaseD002062 procedure between January 2001 and February 2020 meeting Ghent criteria for diseaseD008382 were included in the study. Early and midterm results were retrospectively analyzed. Preoperative, postoperative and follow-up computed tomography angiography scans were analysed. RESULTS: We analyzed 37 9606 [mean age 38 +- 11 years, 65% 9606]. Acute or chronic diseaseD000784 was present in 35 (95%) 9606 (14 and 21 9606 respectively). Two (5%) 9606 had an diseaseD000783 without dissection. diseaseD013577 was present in 4 9606. Twenty-nine (78%) 9606 had history of aortic surgical interventions. The 30-day and in-hospital mortality amounted to 8 and 14% respectively. False lumen exclusion was present in 73% in stented segment in last postoperative CT. The overall 5-year survival was 71% and freedom from reintervention downstream was 58% at 5 years. Of the nine 9606 who required reintervention for distal diseaseD001018, one 9606 diseaseD003643. CONCLUSIONS: diseaseD002062 operation for 9606 with diseaseD008382 can be performed with acceptable mortality and morbidity. In long-term follow-up no reinterventions on the aortic arch were required. diseaseD002062 allows for easier second stage operations providing platform for surgical and endovascular reinterventions.
37203318		[diseaseD019585 in a pediatric 9606 with diseaseD008382].diseaseD019585 (diseaseD019585) is attributed to reduced cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure. It may be spontaneous or secondary to a history of diseaseD014947 or diseaseD034721. We present the case of an 11-year-old boy, with medical history of diseaseD008382, with diseaseD006261 and persistent diseaseD014839 (12 hours) following a fall on the sacrococcygeal region. Magnetic resonance showed extradural fluid collections at dorsal and lumbosacral levels, compatible with diseaseD065634. The condition was resolved with treatment, but the 9606 had two new episodes during the follow-up period. Thus, an epidural blood patch was performed two years after the first episode. Although diseaseC538320 is uncommon in children, it should be suspected in 9606 with diseaseD006261, particularly if the 9606 presents a connectivopathy. Few studies have assessed the management of diseaseC538320 in paediatric age. The case presented here and the reviewed available literature provides further data for these type of cases.
36460281		diseaseD065627 9606 pathway: Strategy for diagnostic work-up of 9606 and families with (suspected) diseaseD065627 (diseaseD065627). A statement from the diseaseD065627 working group of VASCERN.diseaseD065627 (diseaseD065627) are rare pathologies associated with diseaseD000784, which can be syndromic or non-syndromic. They may result from diseaseD030342. Associated genes identified to date are classified into those encoding components of the (a) extracellular matrix (b) ncbi7040 pathway and (c) smooth muscle contractile mechanism. Timely diagnosis allows for prompt aortic surveillance and prophylactic surgery, hence improving life expectancy and reducing maternal complications as well as providing reassurance to family members when a diagnosis is ruled out. This document is an expert opinion reflecting strategies put forward by medical experts and 9606 representatives involved in the diseaseD035583 Working Group of VASCERN. It aims to provide a 9606 pathway that improves 9606 care by diminishing time to diagnosis, facilitating the establishment of a correct diagnosis using molecular genetics when possible, excluding the diagnosis in unaffected persons through appropriate family screening and avoiding overuse of resources. It is being recommended that 9606 are referred to an expert centre for further evaluation if they meet at least one of the following criteria: (1) diseaseD000094629 (<70 years if diseaseD006973; all ages if non-diseaseD006973), (2) diseaseD017545 (all adults with Z score >3.5 or 2.5-3.5 if non-diseaseD006973 or diseaseD006973 and <60 years; all children with Z score >3), (3) family history of diseaseD065627 with/without a pathogenic variant in a gene linked to diseaseD065627, (4) diseaseD004479 without other obvious explanation and (5) a systemic score of >5 in adults and >3 in children. Aortic imaging primarily relies on transthoracic echocardiography with magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography as needed. Genetic testing should be considered in those with a high suspicion of underlying genetic aortopathy. Though panels vary among centers, for 9606 with diseaseD017545 or diseaseD000784 or systemic features these should include genes with a definitive or strong association to diseaseD065627. Genetic cascade screening and serial aortic imaging should be considered for family screening and follow-up. In conclusion, the implementation of these strategies should help standardise the diagnostic work-up and follow-up of 9606 with suspected diseaseD065627 and the screening of their relatives.
36041776	Negative_Correlation|chemicalD000086|diseaseD064090	Late onset sclerotomy diseaseD013529 in a 9606 with diseaseD008382 presenting as recurrent episodes of diseaseD064090.A man in his 50s presented to the eye diseaseD004630 department on three separate occasions complaining of diseaseD014786 and discomfort in the left eye. He had a history of diseaseD008382 and had undergone bilateral 20-gauge (G) pars plana vitrectomy and lensectomy 20 years prior for diseaseD004479. On examination he had epithelial diseaseD015715, diseaseD064090 >40 mm Hg and diseaseD003229, which later appeared as a bleb-like conjunctival elevation. Acute treatment with oral chemicalD000086 and topical diseaseD015814 agents produced a marked reduction in diseaseD064090 to 2-4 mm Hg. A presumed diagnosis of a leaking scleral wound was made. He underwent scleral exploration under general anaesthesia and a leaking sclerotomy was uncovered. The defect was repaired successfully using a scleral patch graft. Late diseaseD013529 of a sclerotomy has been reported rarely in 9606 with diseaseD008382. This is the first reported case to present atypically with intermittent episodes of diseaseD064090 rather than with diseaseD009123.

Technological advances have revolutionized genetic testing for many diseaseC535922, and this study aims to provide insights into the clinical utility of genetic analysis in paediatric diseaseD004479. Children that underwent lens extraction for diseaseD004479 between 2013 and 2017 were identified, and gene panel testing findings and surgical outcomes were collected. Overall, 10/11 cases received a probable molecular diagnosis. Genetic variants were identified in four genes: ncbi2200 (associated with diseaseD008382 and diseaseD002318; n = 6), ncbi54507 (associated with diseaseD004479; n = 2), ncbi4053 (n = 1) and ncbi444 (n = 1). Parents appeared unaffected in 6/11 cases; the initial presentation of all six of these children was to an ophthalmologist, and only 2/6 had ncbi2200 variants. Notably, 4/11 cases required surgery before the age of 4 years, and only one of these children carried an ncbi2200 variant. In summary, in this retrospective cohort study, panel-based genetic testing pointed to a molecular diagnosis in >90% of paediatric diseaseD004479 cases requiring surgery. In a subset of study participants, genetic analysis revealed changes in genes that have not been linked to extraocular manifestations and highlighted that extensive systemic investigations were not required in these individuals. We propose the introduction of genetic testing early in the diagnostic pathway in children with diseaseD004479.
37943993		diseaseD000094683 in Younger Patients (< 60 Years Old) - Does Full Arch Replacement Provide Benefits Compared to Limited Approach?INTRODUCTION: Acute diseaseD000784 diseaseD006969 (diseaseD000784) is a surgical emergency associated with high morbidity and mortality. Although surgical management has improved, the optimal therapy is a matter of debate. Different surgical strategies have been proposed for patients under 60 years old. This paper evaluates the postoperative outcome and the need for secondary aortic operation after a limited surgical approach (proximal arch replacement) vs. extended arch repair. METHODS: Between January 2000 and January 2018, 530 patients received surgical treatment for diseaseD000784 at our hospital; 182 were under 60 years old and were enrolled in this study - Group A (n=68), limited arch repair (proximal arch replacement), and group B (n=114), extended arch repair (> proximal arch replacement). RESULTS: More diseaseD002305 (P=0.005) and preoperative mechanical resuscitation (P=0.014) were seen in Group A. More need for renal replacement therapy (P=0.047) was seen in the full arch group. Mechanical ventilation time (P=0.022) and intensive care unit stay (P<0.001) were shorter in the limited repair group. Thirty-day mortality was comparable (P=0.117). New onset of diseaseD020521 was comparable (Group A four patients [5.9%] vs. Group B 15 patients [13.2%]; P=0.120). Long-term follow-up did not differ significantly for secondary aortic surgery. CONCLUSION: Even though young patients received only limited arch repair, the outcome was comparable. Full-arch replacement was not beneficial in the long-time follow-up. A limited approach is justified in the cohort of young diseaseD000784 patients. Exemptions, like known diseaseD008382 and the presence of an diseaseD012167 in the arch, should be considered.
37753933		Postoperative longitudinal refractive changes in children under 8 years of age with diseaseD004479 and diseaseD008382.PURPOSE: To evaluate the postoperative longitudinal refractive changes in children under 8 years of age with diseaseD004479 and diseaseD008382 (diseaseD008382). SETTING: Zhongshan ophthalmic center, Guangzhou, China. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. METHODS: Medical data of patients diagnosed with diseaseD004479 and diseaseD008382 that underwent surgery before 8 years old were collected. Refractive errors and ocular biometric parameters were collected before surgery and at each follow-up visit. Patients were stratified into groups according to age at surgery and only the eye operated upon first was selected. Multivariable analysis was performed to determine the association between refractive shift and potential risk factors. RESULTS: In total, 54 eyes of 54 patients were enrolled. The median age at surgery was 6.21 years (Interquartile range [IQR], 5.25 to 6.85) and the median follow-up was 2.0 years (IQR, 1.2 to 2.8 years). At 8 years old, patients demonstrated a median myopic shift ranged from -1.75 diopters (D) (IQR, -2.75 to -1.00 D) for the 4-year-old group to -0.13 D (IQR, -0.50 to -0.06 D) for the 7-year-old group. Multivariable analysis showed greater myopic shift was associated with younger age at surgery (P=0.004), male gender (P=0.026) and shorter preoperative axis length (P=0.005). CONCLUSION: A tendency toward increasing postoperative myopic was demonstrated in children with diseaseD004479 and diseaseD008382, with the greatest myopic shift in the younger age groups. If the goal is to reach emmetropia by age 8, the immediate postoperative hypermetropic targets should be 1.75D for 4 years old, 1D for 5 years old, 0.5D for 6 years old, 0 to 0.25D for 7 years old.
36924002		Combined ascending aortobiiliac bypass and endovascular obliteration in the Bentall procedure for dual diseaseD001014.9606 with diseaseD008382 who present with a dual diseaseD001014 are not uncommon in clinical practice; however, the management of these 9606 is a significant challenge. We present a unique case of diseaseD000094628 and challenging infrarenal diseaseD017544 (diseaseD017544) with a short and angulated neck. We performed simultaneous repair using the Bentall procedure and ascending aortobiiliac bypass. Endovascular obliteration of the diseaseD017544 neck and bilateral common iliac arteries was also performed. The perioperative process was uneventful. Normal functioning of the mechanical valve and complete diseaseD013927 of the diseaseD017544 sac were confirmed on follow-up computed tomography and echocardiography. This report suggests that combined ascending aortobiiliac bypass and endovascular obliteration with the Bentall procedure for dual diseaseD001014 is a useful surgical strategy for 9606 with diseaseD008382. Life-long follow-up and medication ought to be mandatory to prevent incomplete exclusion and bypass occlusion.
36395878		Ravitch surgery or dynamic compression bracing for diseaseD066166: a retrospective cohort study.BACKGROUND: diseaseD066166 is a pediatric condition which can be treated by dynamic compression system (DCS) bracing or surgery. Several publications concerning DCS-bracing or surgery are published, however without comparing both treatments. METHODS: Over a 10 year period 738 9606 with diseaseD066166 were treated. We describe our 10-years' experience and results of both treatments. RESULTS: Of the 631 9606 who received DCS-bracing treatment, 553 finished treatment and 78 9606 are still under treatment. Seventy-three point eight percent (n=408) of 9606 finished treatment successfully, 13.6% (n=75) failed treatment and 12.7% (n=70) were lost to follow-up. Success rate decreased with an increasing pressure of initial compression (84.2%-67.3%). diseaseD008382 and diseaseD011045 were related to bad results.Ravitch surgery was performed in 105 9606 with a success rate of 92.4%. Complications occurred in 32.4% of 9606 and 6.7% of 9606 had complications for which surgery was needed. No relationship was found between osteotomy or sternal fixation and outcomes or complications. Abramson procedure was performed in two 9606. CONCLUSIONS: DCS-bracing should be the treatment of choice in 9606 with diseaseD066166 because its non-invasiveness, good results and a lower complication rate compared to surgery. Besides pressure of initial correction, motivation is an important factor influencing outcomes and compliance remains a major challenge in treating diseaseD066166 using DCS-bracing. Bracing 9606 before their growth spurt should be discouraged. 9606 with a higher pressure of initial compression (>8.0-8.5) and diseaseD008382 and diseaseD011045 have poorer outcomes. In those cases surgery may be considered.
36029951		Extrathoracic diseaseD000783 in diseaseD008382: A Systematic Review of the Literature.BACKGROUND: diseaseD008382 (diseaseD008382) most often shows as diseaseD017545 (diseaseD017545) or diseaseD000784, but it may also involve other vascular territories. This study aimed to identify those extrathoracic vascular manifestations most frequently associated with diseaseD008382. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses criteria was carried out. The following databases were included: MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Health Sciences Literature (CINHAL); Spanish database MEDESY Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). RESULTS: A total of 10,008 articles were identified, leaving 155 for the first stage of data analysis (total incidence of diseaseD000783) and 83 for the second (descriptive data analysis). Overall, 518 diseaseD000783 were identified: 149 in the head and neck, 94 in the extremities, and 275 in the aortic, iliac, and visceral sectors. Mostly, they were simultaneously discovered during studies of the diseaseD017545. In the abdominal aorta, the presentation with diseaseD012421 in 11 of 32 9606 stands out. Resection and bypass were the most frequently used methods for repair in the treated cases. CONCLUSIONS: Although its frequency in the general population is unknown, this systematic review suggests that extrathoracic aneurysmal arterial involvement in the diseaseD008382 may be more frequent than expected. We believe screening for diseaseD000783 in other vascular sectors may be advisable, especially in 9606 with diseaseD008382 and diseaseD017545.
35450696		Optimizing evaluation in pediatric and young adult 9606 with diseaseD008382: Novel longitudinal metrics to track growth of aortic structures.OBJECTIVE: Surveillance metrics in pediatric and young adult diseaseD008382 (pMFS) are challenging. We evaluated the utility of aortic root cross-sectional area/height index (ncbi1161/Ht) on echocardiogram among pMFS 9606 as a risk stratification and surgical triage metric. METHODS: Genotype or phenotype positive pMFS 9606 aged 25 years or younger seen at our center from 2001 to 2020 were identified. Time-related transition to surgery was modeled using parametric methods. Predictive utility of ncbi1161/Ht compared with aortic root diameter (ARd) and root Z score (ARz) were modeled using nonlinear multivariable parametric and nonparametric longitudinal regression models. RESULTS: Seventy-nine 9606 (43% female) presented at median age of 5.8 years (15th-85th percentile, 0.75-17 years) with median follow-up of 4.4 years (range, 0-18.5 years). Baseline echocardiography data were: ncbi1161/Ht, 3.9 +- 1.4 cm2/m; ARd, 2.4 +- 0.89 cm; and ARz, 2.4 +- 1.7. ncbi1161/Ht tracked ARd better compared with ARz (r = 0.91 vs 0.24). Eighteen 9606 underwent surgery. Surgical procedures included at least 2 components in 17 (aortic, mitral, tricuspid, aortic root, and arch procedures) and isolated mitral valve procedures in 1 9606. Time-related transition to surgery showed a prominent early phase to 1 year post presentation, followed by a slowly increasing late phase. ncbi1161/Ht had a more linear correlation versus ARz during periods of rapid somatic growth in surgical 9606. Surgical repair occurred at ncbi1161/Ht between 5 and 7 cm2/m. CONCLUSIONS: ncbi1161/Ht tracked ARd well over time. ncbi1161/Ht between 5 and 7 cm2/m might be a promising metric for surgical triage in pMFS 9606. ncbi1161/Ht surgical threshold values in pMFS 9606 occurred at lower than current accepted "surgical" threshold values for ncbi1161/Ht in adult diseaseD008382 9606.
35452326		Complex and Successful Management of a Symptomatic Isolated diseaseD017544 in a Pregnant 9606 with diseaseD008382.Aortopathies associated to diseaseD008382 (diseaseD008382) are important causes of diseaseD063130 during pregnancy. We present a 27-year-old and 24-week pregnant diseaseD008382 9606 who arrived to the emergency department with increasing diseaseD015746; an obstetric ultrasound showed an diseaseD017544 (diseaseD017544), a multislice computed tomography angiography (CTA) confirmed and demonstrated a 7.3 centimeter (cm) infrarenal diseaseD017544 without evidence of diseaseD000784. A multidisciplinary committee determined that an open repair would lead to a significantly high maternal-fetal morbidity and mortality. Although endovascular repair (EVAR) in diseaseD008382 9606 remains controversial, an urgent bridge therapy was considered to be the best option. She was transferred to the angiography suite for EVAR to prevent diseaseD017544 and ensure a satisfactory pregnancy. The 9606 and fetus presented no complications during the procedure and were discharged 3 days later. She continued her pregnancy without eventualities and an elective C-section was performed on week 36. A CTA imaging at 12 months revealed diseaseD057867, we decided to perform endograft explant and a definitive open repair, there were no complications during the procedure, the 9606 is currently asymptomatic. Our case illustrates a complex decision and management that successfully avoid morbidity and mortality of a diseaseD008382 mother and her product; additionally, this experience reinforces the need for lifelong and close surveillance in these 9606.
35853989	Positive_Correlation|chemicalD014527|diseaseD003643; Association|chemicalD014527|diseaseD000784	A retrospective observational study of serum chemicalD014527 and in-hospital mortality in acute diseaseD000784.There is currently insufficient evidence of correlation between on-admission serum chemicalD014527 and in-hospital mortality of 9606 with acute diseaseD000784. Thus, this study analysed the relation between serum chemicalD014527 and in-hospital diseaseD003643 in 9606 with acute diseaseD000784. A total of 1048 9606 with acute diseaseD000784 participated in this study between January 2010 and December 2018. The independent variable was on-admission serum chemicalD014527, whilst the dependent variable was in-hospital diseaseD003643. The covariates of the study included 9606 age, gender, body mass index, smoking status, diseaseD006973, diseaseD003920, diseaseD008382, diseaseD000082882, diseaseD051436, diseaseD020521, diseaseD050197, time to presentation, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, aortic diameter, diseaseD001022, abdominal vessel involvement, arch vessel involvement, ejection fraction value, laboratory parameters, symptom, diseaseD003323 malperfusion, mesenteric malperfusion, diseaseD002547, diseaseD007022/diseaseD012769, diseaseD002305 and operation status. The mean age of the sample was 50.17 +- 11.47 years, with approximately 24.24% of the participants being female. After analysis, it was found that the admission serum chemicalD014527 of 9606 with acute diseaseD000784 was positively correlated with in-hospital diseaseD003643 (OR = 1.04, 95% CI 1.02-1.06). Subsequently, a non-linear relationship was determined between admission serum chemicalD014527 (point 260 micromol/L) and in-hospital mortality for 9606 with acute diseaseD000784. The effect sizes and confidence intervals of the right (serum chemicalD014527 > 260 micromol/L) and left (serum chemicalD014527 <= 260 micromol/L) aspects of the inflection point were 1.04 (1.02-1.05) and 1.00 (0.99-1.02), respectively. Furthermore, subgroup analysis indicated a stable relationship between serum chemicalD014527 and in-hospital mortality, whilst an insignificant difference was found for the interactions between different subgroups. Overall, a non-linear correlation was determined between admission serum chemicalD014527 and in-hospital mortality of 9606 with acute diseaseD000784. When serum chemicalD014527 > 260 micromol/L, it showed a positive correlation with in-hospital mortality.
35152942		Assessment of pleural pressure during sleep in diseaseD008382.STUDY OBJECTIVES: 9606 with diseaseD008382 (diseaseD008382) have a high risk for diseaseD001014. They are also susceptible to diseaseD012891 that may expose them to highly negative intrathoracic pressures known to increase aortic transmural pressure, which may accelerate diseaseD002311. Our objective was to quantify overnight intrathoracic pressure changes during sleep in diseaseD012913 9606 with diseaseD008382 and the therapeutic effect of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). METHODS: We used a questionnaire to identify self-reported diseaseD012913 9606 with diseaseD008382. In these 9606, we monitored intrathoracic pressure using esophageal pressure (Pes) during overnight baseline and CPAP sleep studies. We defined a peak-inspiratory Pes (Pespeak-insp) < - 5 cm chemicalD014867 as greater than normal and examined the distribution of Pespeak-insp during baseline and CPAP studies. RESULTS: In our sample of 23 snorers with diseaseD008382, we found that 70% of sleep breaths exhibited Pespeak-insp < -5 cm chemicalD014867, with diseaseD001049/hypopneass accounting for only 12%, suggesting prevalent stable flow-limited breathing and diseaseD012913. In a subset (n = 12) with Pes monitoring during a CPAP night, CPAP lowered the mean proportion of breaths with Pespeak-insp < -5 cm chemicalD014867 from 83.7% +- 14.9% to 3.6% +- 3.0% (P < .001). In addition, contemporaneous aortic root diameter was associated with the mean Pespeak-insp during inspiratory flow-limited breathing and diseaseD001049/diseaseD012891 (beta = -0.05, r = .675, P = .033). CONCLUSIONS: The sleep state in diseaseD008382 revealed prolonged exposure to exaggerated negative inspiratory Pes, which was reversible with CPAP. Since negative intrathoracic pressure can contribute to thoracic aortic stress and diseaseD002311, diseaseD012913 may be a reversible risk factor for progression of diseaseD005598 in diseaseD008382.

35285871		Open surgical replacement of the descending thoracic and thoracoabdominal aorta in 9606 with confirmed diseaseD055947: A 20-year single-centre experience.OBJECTIVES: A relatively small proportion of 9606 with heritable diseaseD013896 require open surgical replacement of the distal thoracic aorta. We reviewed the outcome in 9606 with diseaseD055947 treated in an aortic centre in the United Kingdom. METHODS: We performed a single-centre retrospective study of consecutive 9606 treated between October 1999 and December 2019. The primary end point was 30-day mortality. Secondary end points were Kaplan-Meier estimates of medium-term survival and freedom from distal reintervention. Data are presented as median (interquartile range). RESULTS: A total of 58 9606 [33 9606; 51 with diseaseD008382; median age 41 years (35-48); median diseaseD000783 diameter 60 mm (55-74)] underwent open descending (n = 21) or thoracoabdominal aortic replacement (n = 37). All repairs were performed using cardiopulmonary bypass with hypothermic circulatory arrest in 31 9606. The 30-day mortality was 5.2% (n = 3, including 2 9606 >= 60 years with significant comorbidity). Major non-fatal complications included early reoperation (n = 7), tracheostomy (n = 9), temporary renal replacement therapy (n = 3), permanent diseaseD013118 (n = 2) and permanent diseaseD020521 (n = 1). Median follow-up was 81 months (48-127). Estimated (+-standard error) 5-year survival was 85% +-5%. Seven 9606 had distal aortic reintervention with no diseaseD003643 or diseaseD013118: estimated 5-year freedom from distal reintervention was 94% +-3%. There was no difference in survival or freedom from distal reintervention comparing: elective vs. non-elective; type of heritable diseaseD013896; DeBakey type; or extent of surgical repair. CONCLUSIONS: Descending thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortic replacement in 9606 with heritable diseaseD013896 can be performed with low perioperative morbidity and mortality, satisfactory long-term survival and low requirement for distal reintervention.
36740496		Aortic valve reimplantation in 9606 with diseaseD003240: Are the leaflets durable?OBJECTIVE: The durability of reimplanted disease157700 aortic valves in root replacements for 9606 with diseaseD003240 (diseaseD003240) is unclear; therefore, we sought to evaluate the long-term resilience of these repairs. METHODS: From January 1980 to January 2020, 214 9606 with diseaseD003240 and 645 without diseaseD003240 underwent primary, elective aortic valve reimplantation operations at Cleveland Clinic. The diseaseD003240 cohort included 164 (77%) with diseaseD008382, 23 (11%) with diseaseD055947, and 7 (3.3%) with diseaseD003240. We accounted for differing 9606 characteristics between the groups by propensity score matching to compare outcomes, yielding 96 matched pairs. Longitudinal echocardiographic measures were compared using nonlinear mixed effects models. RESULTS: In the diseaseD003240 cohort, there were no operative mortalities (30-day or in-hospital), 1 (0.47%) diseaseD020521, and 1 (0.47%) early in-hospital reoperation for diseaseD006349. Ten-year prevalence of no diseaseD001022 was 86%, mild 11%, and moderate 3%. Ten-year freedom from reoperation was 97%. In propensity matched cohorts, there were no significant differences in in-hospital outcomes, longitudinal diseaseD001022 and mean gradient, risk of reoperation on the aortic valve, or risk of late diseaseD003643. CONCLUSIONS: Aortic valve reimplantation is a durable operation in 9606 with diseaseD003240 and diseaseD000094628. These 9606 do not experience early degeneration of their reimplanted aortic valves.
37264881	Positive_Correlation|diseaseD008382|variant#2200#p.E2189fsX; Association|diseaseD008382|ncbi2200	Disruption of ncbi2200 by an Alu element insertion: A novel genetic cause of diseaseD008382.Alu elements are retrotransposons with ubiquitous presence in the 9606 genome that have contributed to 9606 genomic diversity and health. These approximately 300-bp sequences can cause or mediate disease by disrupting coding/splicing regions in the germline, by insertional mutagenesis in somatic cells, and in promoting formation of copy-number variants. Alu elements may also disrupt epigenetic regulation by affecting non-coding regulatory regions. There are increasing reports of apparently sporadic and diseaseD030342 caused by Alu-related gene disruption, but diseaseD008382 resulting from Alu element insertion has not been previously described. We report a family with classic features of diseaseD008382 whose previous ncbi2200 genetic testing was inconclusive. Using contemporary next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics analysis, a pathogenic/disruptive Alu insertion occurring in the coding region of the ncbi2200 gene was identified (c.6564_6565insAlu; variant#2200#p.E2189fsX) and was confirmed and specified further with Sanger sequencing. This identified the molecular basis of disease in the family that was missed using previous genetic testing technologies and highlights a novel pathogenic mechanism for diseaseD008382. This case adds to the growing literature of diseaseD030342 caused by Alu retrotransposition, and it also shows the growing capability of genomic technologies for detecting atypical mutation events.
37327953		A Systematic Review Supporting the Society for Vascular Surgery Guidelines on the Management of diseaseD065627.BACKGROUND: To support the development of clinical practice guidelines on the management of 9606 with genetic aortopathies and diseaseD020212, a writing committee from the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) has commissioned this systematic review. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and searched multiple databases for studies addressing six questions identified by the SVS guideline committee about evaluating and managing 9606 with genetic aortopathies and diseaseD020212. Studies were selected and appraised by pairs of independent reviewers. RESULTS: We included 12 studies in this systematic review. We did not identify studies about the long-term outcomes of endovascular repair for diseaseD001014 in 9606 with heritable aortopathy or about new aortic events in pregnant 9606 with a history of diseaseD000784 diseaseD000783. A small case series demonstrated 100% survival rate and 100% aortic intervention-free survival at 15 months (range 7-28 months) following endograft repair for diseaseD000784. A positive genetic diagnosis was discovered in 36% of 9606 with diseaseD000784 who had no risk factors for diseaseD009386, and these 9606 had a mortality rate of 11% at a median follow-up duration of 5 months. Black 9606 had lower 30-day mortality than White 9606 (5.6% vs. 9%; respectively), but they had a higher overall aortic reintervention rate at 30-day post-diseaseD000784 repair (47% vs. 27%; respectively). Aortic reinterventions due to diseaseD000783 expansion and diseaseD057867 at 30 days were higher in Black 9606 than White 9606. The certainty of evidence was judged to be very low across all the outcomes evaluated in this systematic review. CONCLUSION: The available evidence suggests high survival after TEVAR for diseaseD000784 in young 9606 with diseaseD065627 but with limited long-term follow-up. Genetic testing in 9606 with acute diseaseD000784 had a high yield. It was positive for most 9606 with risk factors for diseaseD009386 and in over a third for all other 9606, and was associated with new aortic events within 15 years.

This study aimed to perform clinical diseaseD013736 in a family with a history of ncbi2200 for two generations. A family with two members affected by ncbi2200 approached the hospital for diseaseD013736 The couple decided to join the project following extensive counselling and informed consent was obtained. The mutation contributory to ncbi2200 was identified using whole-exome sequencing (WES). A novel diseaseD013736 protocol using multiplex fluorescent PCR and mini-sequencing was developed and tested. Ten blastocysts were subjected to diseaseD013736 in two clinical PGT cycles. Mini-sequencing revealed four normal and six affected embryos. Microsatellite-based linkage analysis confirmed mutation analysis results in all samples. The embryos diagnosed as normal (non-ncbi2200) were chosen for transfer. A pregnancy was obtained in the third embryo transfer. Invasive prenatal diagnosis confirmed the normal genotype of the baby. This study demonstrated comprehensive management using the application of clinical-based diagnosis, WES for mutation identification within the ncbi2200 gene, mini-sequencing for embryo selection and microsatellite-based linkage analysis for backup of diseaseD013736 results and contamination detection to assist couples in having a healthy child when there was a family history of diseaseD008382.Impact StatementWhat is already known on this subject? diseaseD008382 (ncbi2200, OMIM#154700) is an diseaseC566739 causing aortopathy including fatal diseaseD000784. Pre-implantation genetic testing (PGT) is an alternative to traditional invasive prenatal diagnosis (PND) giving the couples the chance of starting pregnancy with the confidence that the baby will be unaffected. Most of the previous PGT reports employed microsatellite-based linkage analysis. A few PGT studies used sequencing, mini-sequencing and mutation analysis; however, the details of the techniques were not described.What do the results of this study add? Single-cell PCR protocol using multiplex fluorescent PCR and mini-sequencing was developed and validated. Two clinical PGTs cycles for diseaseD008382 were performed. A healthy baby was resulted. The details of multiplex fluorescent PCR and mini-sequencing protocols are described in this study so that the procedures can be reproduced.What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? Embryo selection can help the family suffering from diseaseD008382 for two generations to start a pregnancy with confidence that their child will be unaffected. This study also shows the use of a mini-sequencing protocol for PGT, which can be a universal protocol for other mutations by changing the PCR primers and mini-sequencing primers.
36661250		Outcomes for Treatment of Capsulolabral diseaseD000267 With a Capsular Spacer During Revision diseaseD025981 Arthroscopy.BACKGROUND: The presence of diseaseD000267 is a common source of diseaseD013001 after diseaseD025981 arthroscopic surgery and an indication for revision surgery. The placement of a capsular spacer in the capsulolabral recess after lysis of diseaseD000267 has been developed to treat and prevent the recurrence of diseaseD000267. PURPOSE: To evaluate 9606-reported outcomes (PROs) and survivorship at a minimum of 2 years after revision diseaseD025981 arthroscopic surgery with capsular spacer placement for capsular diseaseD000267. STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: Between January 2013 and June 2018, a total of 95 9606 (99 hips) aged >=18 years underwent revision diseaseD025981 arthroscopic surgery for the treatment of capsular diseaseD000267 with the placement of a capsular spacer. Overall, 53 9606 (56 hips) met the inclusion criteria and had a minimum 2-year follow-up, forming the cohort of this study. Exclusion criteria included confounding diseaseD001851 (eg, diseaseD007873, diseaseD008382), diseaseD000070636, or advanced diseaseD010003 (Tonnis grade 2 or 3). Preoperative and postoperative outcome scores (modified Harris diseaseD025981 Score [mHHS], diseaseD025981 Outcome Score-Activities of Daily Living [HOS-ADL], diseaseD025981 Outcome Score-Sport-Specific Subscale [HOS-SSS], 12-Item Short Form Health Survey [SF-12], and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities diseaseD010003 Index [WOMAC]) were collected and compared in addition to the revision rate, conversion to total diseaseD025981 arthroplasty, and 9606 satisfaction. RESULTS: The mean age of the cohort was 32 +- 11 years, with 32 female hips (57%) and a median number of previous diseaseD025981 arthroscopic procedures of 1 (range, 1-5). The arthroplasty- and revision-free survivorship rate at 2 years was 91%. Overall, 5 9606 (6 hips; 11%) underwent revision surgery at a mean of 2.4 +- 1.4 years after capsular spacer placement, with symptomatic capsular defects being the most common finding. There were 4 9606 (7%) who converted to total diseaseD025981 arthroplasty. For hips not requiring subsequent surgery (n = 46), there was a significant improvement in outcome scores except for the SF-12 Mental Component Summary, with rates of achieving the minimal clinically important difference of 70%, 70%, and 65% for the mHHS, HOS-ADL, and HOS-SSS, respectively. CONCLUSION: Capsular spacers, as part of a systematic approach including lysis of diseaseD000267 with early and consistent postoperative physical therapy including circumduction exercises, resulted in improved PROs as well as high arthroplasty- and revision-free survivorship (91%) at a minimum 2-year follow-up. Capsular spacers should be considered in revision diseaseD025981 arthroscopic procedures when an adequate labral volume remains but diseaseD000267 continue to be a concern.
35384050		Valve-sparing versus valve-replacing aortic root replacement in 9606 with diseaseD000094628.BACKGROUND: Valve-sparing aortic root replacement (VSARR) is an alternative to valve-replacing aortic root replacement (VRARR) with valved-conduits based on recent guidelines for clinical practice. This study investigated outcomes of these two procedures in 9606 with nonstenotic valves. METHODS: Between January 7, 2007 and June 30, 2019, 475 9606 with diseaseD000094628 without diseaseD001024 underwent VSARR (151) or VRARR (324) techniques. Propensity score-matching (PSM) was used to alleviate confounding. Endpoints were 30-day mortality, 8-year survival and reoperation, diseaseD001022, and valve gradients. RESULTS: PSM created 69 pairs of 9606 with a mean age 52 +- 13 years (10.1% diseaseD008382, 34.8% diseaseD000082882). There was no statistically significant difference in major perioperative morbidity or 30-day mortality (0% VSARR vs. 1.4% VRARR; p = 0.316). Overall survival was significantly higher (p = 0.025) in the VSARR group versus the VRARR group (8-year estimates 100% vs. 88.9%, respectively), while freedom from valve reoperation was similar (p = 0.97, 8-year estimates 90.9% vs. 96.7%, respectively). Freedom from > moderate-severe diseaseD013734 was not significantly different (p = 0.08, 8-year estimates 90.0% VSARR group vs. 100% VRARR), but mean valve gradients at last follow-up were better in the VSARR group (5.9 vs. 13.2 mmHg, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: VSARR is a safe operation in 9606 with diseaseD000094628 and nonstenotic aortic valves in the hands of experienced surgeons. Freedom from reoperation is similar and the mode of diseaseD051437 differs between the two groups.
36269370		Assessment of aortic diameter in diseaseD008382 9606: intraindividual comparison of 3D-Dixon and 2D-SSFP magnetic resonance imaging.OBJECTIVES: To compare the accuracy and precision of 3D-Dixon and 2D-SSFP MR-imaging for assessment of aortic diameter in diseaseD008382 9606. METHODS: This prospective single-center study investigated respiratory-gated 3D-Dixon and breath-hold 2D-SSFP non-contrast MR-imaging at 3 T in 47 diseaseD008382 9606 (36.0 +- 13.2 years, 28 ,19 ). Two radiologists performed individual diameter measurements at five levels of the thoracic aorta and evaluated image quality on a four-grade scale (1 = poor, 4 = excellent) and artifacts (1 = severe, 4 = none). Aortic root diameters acquired by echocardiography served as a reference standard. Intraclass correlation coefficient, Bland-Altman analyses, F-test, t-test, and regression analyses were used to assess agreement between observers and methods. RESULTS: Greatest aortic diameters were observed at the level of the sinuses of Valsalva (SOV) for 3D-Dixon (38.2 +- 6.8 mm) and 2D-SSFP (38.3 +- 7.1 mm) (p = 0.53). Intra- and interobserver correlation of diameter measurements was excellent at all aortic levels for both 3D-Dixon (r = 0.94-0.99 and r = 0.94-0.98) and 2D-SSFP (r = 0.96-1.00 and r = 0.95-0.99). 3D-Dixon-derived and 2D-SSFP-derived diameter measurements at the level of the SOV revealed a strong correlation with echocardiographic measurements (r = 0.92, p < 0.001 and r = 0.93, p < 0.001, respectively). The estimated mean image quality at the level of SOV was higher for 2D-SSFP compared to that for 3D-Dixon (3.3 (95%-CI: 3.1-3.5) vs. 2.9 (95%-CI: 2.7-3.1)) (p < 0.001). Imaging artifacts were less at all aortic levels for 3D-Dixon compared to 2D-SSFP (3.4-3.8 vs. 2.8-3.1) (all p < 0.002). CONCLUSION: Respiratory-gated 3D-Dixon and breath-hold 2D-SSFP MR-imaging provide accurate and precise aortic diameter measurements. We recommend 3D-Dixon imaging for monitoring of aortic diameter in diseaseD008382 9606 due to fewer imaging artifacts and the possibility of orthogonal multiplanar reformations of the aortic root. KEY POINTS:   Respiratory-gated 3D-Dixon and breath-hold 2D-SSFP imaging provide accurate and precise aortic diameter measurements in 9606 suffering from diseaseD008382.   Imaging artifacts are stronger in 2D-SFFP imaging than in 3D-Dixon imaging.   We recommend 3D-Dixon imaging for monitoring of aortic diameter in diseaseD008382 9606 due to fewer imaging artifacts and the possibility of orthogonal multiplanar reformations.
35275761		D-dimer in diseaseD008382: effect of diseaseD020181 induced blood pressure surges.diseaseD000784 are the major causes of diseaseD003643 in persons with diseaseD008382 (diseaseD008382), a rare diseaseD030342 featuring diseaseD018376. We and others have found that diseaseD020181 (diseaseD020181) confers significant vascular stress in this population and may accelerate diseaseD001018 progression. We hypothesized that D-dimer, a diagnostic biomarker for several types of diseaseD057772 that is also elevated in persons with diseaseD008382 with diseaseD006529, may be sensitive to cardiovascular stresses caused by diseaseD020181. To test this concept, we recruited 16 persons with diseaseD008382 without diseaseD000784 and randomized them to two nights of polysomnography, without (baseline) and with diseaseD020181 treatment: continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). In addition to scoring diseaseD020181 by the diseaseD020181 index (AHI), beat-by-beat systolic BP (SBP) and pulse-pressure (PP) fluctuations were quantified. Morning blood samples were also assayed for D-dimer levels. In this cohort (male:female, 10:6; age, 36 +- 13 yr; aortic diameter, 4 +- 1 cm), CPAP eliminated diseaseD020181 (AHI: 20 +- 17 vs. 3 +- 2 events/h, P = 0.001) and decreased fluctuations in SBP (13 +- 4 vs. 9 +- 3 mmHg, P = 0.011) and PP (7 +- 2 vs. 5 +- 2 mmHg, P = 0.013). CPAP also reduced D-dimer levels from 1,108 +- 656 to 882 +- 532 ng/mL (P = 0.023). Linear regression revealed a positive association between the maximum PP during diseaseD020181 and D-dimer in both the unadjusted (r = 0.523, P = 0.038) and a model adjusted for contemporaneous aortic root diameter (r = 0.733, P = 0.028). Our study revealed that overnight CPAP reduces D-dimer levels commensurate with the elimination of diseaseD020181 and concomitant hemodynamic fluctuations. Morning D-dimer measurements together with diseaseD020181 screening might serve as predictors of diseaseD057772 in diseaseD008382.NEW & NOTEWORTHY What is New? Surges in blood pressure caused by diseaseD020181 during sleep increase vascular stress and D-dimer levels in diseaseD008382. Elevations in D-dimer can be lowered with CPAP. What is Noteworthy? D-dimer levels might serve as a marker for determining the significance of diseaseD020181 in persons with diseaseD008382. D-dimer or diseaseD020181 screening is a potential method to identify persons with diseaseD008382 at risk for adverse cardiovascular events.
35691461		Endovascular and Hybrid Repair in 9606 with Heritable diseaseD013896.BACKGROUND: In individuals with heritable diseaseD013896 (diseaseD065627), endovascular repair for treatment of diseaseD000784 may be lifesaving, but is associated with increased risk of failure of endovascular repair and adverse outcomes. This study reports our experience with early and late outcomes of endovascular aortic and branch vessel repair in 9606 with diseaseD065627. METHODS: A retrospective case series was performed by chart review of individuals with diseaseD065627 followed at Washington University School of Medicine/Barnes-Jewish Hospital who underwent endovascular aortic and/or branch vessel repair. Clinical features, imaging characteristics, and short- and long-term outcomes were collected. RESULTS: Twenty-nine 9606 with diseaseD065627 (20 male; mean age 45 +- 13 years) underwent 37 endovascular procedures between 2006 and 2020 with mean follow up of 54 +- 41 months. Seven 9606 underwent two or more separate endovascular procedures. Each procedure was considered separate for data collection and analysis. Underlying conditions included diseaseD008382 (n = 16 procedures), diseaseD055947 (n = 14 procedures), vascular diseaseD004535 (n = 3 procedures), and nonsyndromic diseaseD065627 (n = 4 procedures). Twenty 9606 (69%) had prior open surgical aortic repair. Indications for endovascular aortic repair (n = 31) included urgent repairs of acute complications of diseaseD000784 (n = 10) or diseaseD017542 (n = 3), and elective aortic repair (n = 18; 10 chronic diseaseD000784 and eight chronic diseaseD000783). Six 9606 underwent elective endovascular repair of six branch vessel diseaseD000783 or diseaseD000784. Six 9606 underwent hybrid open surgical and endovascular repair. Of the 37 procedures, 25 (68%) proximal landing zones were in the native aorta or branch vessel, 11 (30%) were in a surgical graft or elephant trunk and one was in a previously placed endograft. Thirty-six (97%) procedures were technically successful, and none required emergency surgical conversion. Two 9606 died: one from diseaseD018805 and one from presumed late diseaseD017541, for a 5% per-procedure mortality rate. Two procedures were complicated by diseaseD020521 and one 9606 developed diseaseD020335. Of the 31 aortic procedures, seven aortic endografts (23%) developed a stent-induced new entry (SINE) discovered with imaging at 20 +- 15 days post-procedure. Seven endografts (23%) developed a diseaseD057867 and eight (26%) developed a diseaseD057867. No diseaseD057867 were seen. Within 30 days, two endografts (of 37, 5%) required reintervention. After 30 days, fifteen additional endografts (of 37, 41%) required reintervention. Two 9606 (of 6, 33%) who underwent hybrid repair required reintervention. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the largest single-center case series examining outcomes of diseaseD065627 9606 following endovascular repair. Urgent and elective endovascular repairs in 9606 with diseaseD065627 can manage acute and chronic complications of diseaseD000784 with relatively low risk. However, risk of early and late diseaseD057867 and SINE is high. Close post-procedural surveillance is required, and many individuals will require additional interventions. Hybrid repair shows promise and requires further investigation.

In our previous studies, we have found that a substantial proportion of 9606 with diseaseD009140 could be explained by diseaseD009358. More recently, complex phenotypes caused by more than one diseaseD030342 (i.e., dual molecular diagnosis) have also been reported in diseaseD009140 and may complicate the diagnostic odyssey of 9606. In this study, we report the molecular and phenotypic characteristics of 9606 with dual molecular diagnosis and variable diseaseD009140. RESULTS: From 1108 9606 who underwent exome sequencing, we identified eight probands with dual molecular diagnosis and variable diseaseD009140. All eight 9606 had dual diagnosis consisting of two autosomal dominant diseases. A total of 16 variants in 12 genes were identified, 5 of which were of de novo origin. 9606 with dual molecular diagnosis presented blended phenotypes of two diseaseD030342. diseaseD025861 occurred more than once include diseaseD010013 (ncbi1277, MIM:166200), diseaseD009456 (ncbi4763, MIM:162200) and diseaseD008382 (ncbi2200, MIM:154700). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the complicated skeletal phenotypes associated with dual molecular diagnosis. Exome sequencing represents a powerful tool to detect such complex conditions.
37459280		Long-term survival case with severe infantile diseaseD008382: A case report.
35791125		Outcomes of surgical intervention in cases of diseaseD004479.Purpose: To evaluate the outcomes of surgical intervention in cases of diseaseD004479. Methods: This retrospective study included all cases of diseaseD004479 that presented between June 2015 and March 2019 in a tertiary care center. They were reviewed retrospectively. The corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), severity of lens diseaseD004204, type of surgery, intra-operative and post-operative complication, and specular count were recorded. Results: Seventy-eight eyes of 57 cases with a mean age at surgery of 14.73 years were analyzed. Intra-lenticular lens aspiration was the most common (n-62/78; 79.5%) surgical procedure followed by lens aspiration, intra-capsular diseaseD002386 extraction, phaco-aspiration, and pars-plana lensectomy. Simultaneous intra-ocular lens (IOL) implantation was performed in 46.2% (n-32/78) of the eyes. The mean CDVA improved from 0.85 +- 0.55 logMAR to 0.44 +- 0.29 logMAR at 6 weeks follow-up. The post-operative CDVA was significantly better in the pseudo-phakic group compared to the aphakic group (p-0.02). The 9606's age at the time of surgery and the degree of diseaseD004204 did not impact the final visual outcome. Intra-operative complication included diseaseD014823 (n-1) and lens diseaseD020427 (n-1). Post-operative complications were noted in 26.9% of the eyes (n-21/78) with a higher complication rate in the pseudo-phakic group (p-0.00). A second intervention was required in 7.7% of the eyes (n-6/78). Conclusion: Age and degree of diseaseD004204 at the time of surgery do not influence the final visual outcome in cases of diseaseD004479 undergoing lens extraction surgery. IOL implantation results in better visual outcomes but is associated with a high complication rate.
37773813		Reduced volume and altered composition of paraspinal muscles in diseaseD008382: A retrospective cohort study.Retrospective cohort study. diseaseD013122 in patients with diseaseD008382 (diseaseD008382) are distinct from those in patients with diseaseD012600 (diseaseD012600). It is more prone to progression and more likely to present with diseaseD017760 than diseaseD012600. However, the etiology of this characteristic diseaseD013122 in diseaseD008382 remains unclear. This study aimed to determine the spinal musculature characteristics in patients with diseaseD008382 on the hypothesis that the paraspinal muscles of patients with diseaseD008382 would be qualitatively or quantitatively different from those of patients with diseaseD012600. Seventeen consecutive patients with diseaseD008382 aged 25 years or younger undergoing surgery for diseaseD012600 in our hospital were compared with age- and sex-matched patients with diseaseD012600 undergoing surgery for diseaseD012600. The body size-adjusted relative cross-sectional area (rCSA), fatty infiltration ratio (FI%), and relative functional cross-sectional area (rFCSA) of the psoas muscles (PM) and paravertebral muscles (PVM) at L3/4 and L4/5 were measured using preoperative T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Functional CSA was defined as total CSA minus the fatty infiltration area of each muscle and rFCSA was calculated as the body size-adjusted functional CSA. The rCSA of the PM at L3/4 and L4/5 was significantly smaller in the diseaseD008382 group than in the diseaseD012600 group (L3/4, P = .021; L4/5, P = .002). The FI% of the PM at L4/5 was significantly higher in the diseaseD008382 group (P = .044). Consequently, the rFCSA of the PM at L3/4 and L4/5 and the rFCSA of the PVM at L3/4 in the diseaseD008382 group were significantly smaller than those in the diseaseD012600 group (PM at L3/4, P = .021; PM at L4/5, P = .001; PVM at L3/4, P = .025). Compared with patients with diseaseD012600, patients with diseaseD008382 exhibited significantly decreased body-size-adjusted CSA of the PM and reduced body-size-adjusted functional CSA of the PVM and PM. These findings may partially explain the characteristics of distinctive diseaseD013122 in patients with diseaseD008382.
37861579		Absent right diseaseD013479 and persistent left diseaseD013479: An incidental finding.A patient with diseaseD008382 undergoing Bentall operation was found to have an absent right diseaseD013479 and persistent left diseaseD013479. The diseaseD002311 raised the suspicion of persistent left diseaseD013479. The diagnosis was confirmed by agitated saline contrast echocardiography and computed tomography of the chest.
35428473		Association of initial management on readmissions for diseaseD005598 diseaseD011030 in adolescents.BACKGROUND: In adolescents, initial treatment of diseaseD005598 diseaseD011030 (diseaseD011030) must balance the recurrence risk with invasiveness. While institutional series have sought to define the role of early intervention, large-scale analysis is lacking. The present study aimed to evaluate the impact of initial strategy on recurrence and resource utilization in a nationally representative cohort. METHODS: 9606 (10-20 years) admitted for first-time diseaseD011030 were identified using the 2010-2019 Nationwide Readmissions Database. Based on the initial management strategy, 9606 were classified as nonoperative management, chest tube drainage only, and operative intervention. Multivariable regression was used to evaluate the impact of approach on outcomes of interest. The primary outcome was recurrence within 90 days, while length of stay and hospitalization costs were secondarily considered. RESULTS: Of an estimated 20,887 9606, 35.5% were classified as nonoperative management, 35.2% as chest tube drainage only, and 29.2% as operative intervention. Compared to others, the operative intervention cohort more frequently had diseaseD008382 and diseaseD041882 blebs. After adjustment, 9606 initially managed operatively experienced lower odds of recurrence (adjusted odds ratio: 0.48, 95% confidence interval: 0.36-0.64), while chest tube drainage only had increased risk (adjusted odds ratio: 1.93, 95% confidence interval: 1.59-2.34) with nonoperative management as reference. Incremental 90-day length of stay was greater in operative intervention (beta: +2.4 days, 95% confidence interval: 1.8-3.0) compared to nonoperative management, but 90-day costs were similar. CONCLUSION: Initial operative management for first-time diseaseD011030 appears to reduce risk of recurrence while demonstrating similar total costs. Due to high recurrence rates associated with conservative approaches, initial surgical intervention may be considered in this 9606 population.
35595210		Endovascular Repair in 9606 with diseaseD008382: Concerns Amid Controversy.Endovascular aortic repair is widely used to treat 9606 with diseaseD019636 or diseaseD000784 within the distal aorta. Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) is generally associated with fewer short-term complications than open surgical repair, which is particularly important for older 9606 with significant comorbid conditions. However, for 9606 with diseaseD008382, a heritable diseaseD013896 associated with diseaseD002311, diseaseD000784, and diseaseD012421, the utility of endovascular aortic repair remains questionable. diseaseD008382 9606 have friable aortic tissue and are typically treated at a relatively young age with few comorbidities; they therefore have less operative risk and need a durable solution. Furthermore, those who need distal aortic repair tend to have chronic diseaseD000784. Although TEVAR is generally superior to open surgery with regard to short-term complications, it is less durable, and TEVAR reintervention rates are highest in 9606 with chronic diseaseD000784. Thus, diseaseD008382 9606 seeking definitive aortic repair are often better served by open repair. Nonetheless, TEVAR may be useful in 9606 with diseaseD008382 as a bridge to open repair or as treatment for late complications of previous open repair.
35679177	Association|diseaseD008382|ncbi2200; Association|diseaseD017541|ncbi2200	A unique cardiovascular presentation of diseaseD008382.We report a neonate with severe diseaseD008382 (diseaseD008382), prenatally identified to have persistent diseaseD013617, diseaseD018754, and an unusual structure within the atria. Detailed postnatal echocardiographic evaluation and cross-sectional imaging confirmed diseaseD017541. Emergent testing by next-generation sequencing identified a ncbi2200 pathological variant, key to establishing goals of care. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a diseaseD017541 in diseaseD008382.
