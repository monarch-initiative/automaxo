38308541		Adverse pregnancy, fetal and neonatal outcomes in 9606 with diseaseD000755 in a Middle Eastern country.BACKGROUND: diseaseD000755 in pregnancy is associated with high maternal and fetal mortality. However, studies reporting pregnancy, fetal, and neonatal outcomes in 9606 with diseaseD000755 are extremely limited. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of the study are to determine whether 9606 with diseaseD000755 have a greater risk of adverse pregnancy, fetal, and neonatal outcomes than 9606 without diseaseD000755 and identify the predictors of adverse pregnancy, fetal, and neonatal outcomes in 9606 with diseaseD000755. DESIGN: A retrospective pair-matched case-control study was conducted to compare 171 pregnant 9606 with diseaseD000755 to 171 pregnant 9606 without diseaseD000755 in Muscat, Sultanate of Oman. METHODS: All pregnant Omani 9606 with diseaseD000755 who delivered between January 2015 and August 2021 at Sultan Qaboos University Hospital and Royal Hospital, who were either primipara or multipara and who had a gestational age of 24-42 weeks, were included as 9606, whereas 9606 who had no diseaseD000755 or any comorbidity during pregnancy, who delivered within the same timeframe and at the same hospitals, were recruited as controls. The data were retrieved from electronic medical records and delivery registry books between January 2015 and August 2021. RESULTS: 9606 with diseaseD000755 who had severe diseaseD000740 had increased odds of (chi2 = 58.56, p < 0.001) having adverse pregnancy outcomes. 9606 with diseaseD000755 had 21.97% higher odds of delivering a baby with diseaseD005317 (chi2 = 17.80, unadjusted odds ratio = 2.91-166.13, p < 0.001). Newborns born to 9606 with diseaseD000755 had 3.93% greater odds of being admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (chi2 = 16.80, unadjusted odds ratio = 1.97-7.84, p < 0.001). In addition, the children born to 9606 with diseaseD000755 had 10.90% higher odds of being born with low birth weight (chi2 = 56.92, unadjusted odds ratio = 5.36-22.16, p < 0.001). Hemoglobin level (odds ratio = 0.17, p < 0.001, 95% confidence interval = 0.10-3.0), past medical history (odds ratio = 7.95, p < 0.001, 95% confidence interval = 2.39-26.43), past surgical history (odds ratio = 17.69, p < 0.001, 95% confidence interval = 3.41-91.76), and diseaseD047928 (odds ratio = 9.48, p = 0.005, 95% confidence interval = 1.95-46.23) were identified as predictors of adverse pregnancy, fetal, and neonatal outcomes in 9606 with diseaseD000755. CONCLUSION: As pregnant 9606 with diseaseD000755 are at increased risk for pregnancy, fetal, and neonatal adverse outcomes; improved antenatal surveillance and management may improve the outcomes.
38331925		Role of hydroxyurea therapy in the prevention of diseaseD000092124 in diseaseD000755: a systematic review and meta-analysis.BACKGROUND: Hydroxyurea is an affordable drug that reduces diseaseD013224 and transfusion requirements in diseaseD000755. However, its effectiveness in preventing chronic diseaseD000092124 is still unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the role of hydroxyurea in preventing organ morbidity. METHOD: We included original articles published in English from 1st January 1990 to 31st January 2023, reporting hydroxyurea therapy and diseaseD000092124 from PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, and CrossRef databases. A total of 45 studies with 4681 diseaseD000755 9606 were evaluated for diseaseD000092124. RESULTS: Our analysis showed that hydroxyurea intervention significantly lowered transcranial Doppler and tricuspid regurgitant velocity, with a standardized mean difference of - 1.03 (- 1.49; - 0.58); I 2 = 96% and - 1.37 (CI - 2.31, - 0.42); I 2 = 94%, respectively. Moreover, the pooled estimate for diseaseD000419 showed a beneficial effect post-hydroxyurea therapy by reducing the risk of diseaseD000419 by 58% (risk ratio of 0.42 (0.28; 0.63); I 2 = 28%). CONCLUSION: Our study found that a hydroxyurea dose above 20 mg/kg/day with a mean rise in HbF by 18.46% post-hydroxyurea therapy had a beneficial role in reducing transcranial doppler velocity, tricuspid regurgitant velocity, diseaseD000419, and diseaseD013158.

38429041		The Inequality of diseaseD010146 Control in 9606 With diseaseD010146 From diseaseD000755: A Case Report.Approximately 100,000 people in the United States are affected by diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755). diseaseD059787 and diseaseD059350 are common and are experienced by everyone with diseaseD000755. Children and adolescents who had diseaseD010146 from diseaseD000755 reported daily diseaseD010146, decreased function, missed school/workdays, and limited participation in recreational and social activities. This case report aims to highlight the lack of diversity, equity, and inclusion of diseaseD010146 control through the lens of a 9606 with diseaseD000755 to improve clinical practice.
38321797		Clinicopathologic Study of diseaseD000755: A Nigerian Experience.BACKGROUND: Improvements in diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755) care have resulted in the survival of many 9606 into adulthood, although this is accompanied by the increased incidence of diseaseC564816, including diseaseD051436 (diseaseD051436). OBJECTIVES: This study assessed the prevalence, pattern and predictors of diseaseD007674 in diseaseD000755 9606 and investigated the associated renal histopathologic changes. METHODS: We evaluated 105 9606 with diseaseD000755, for diseaseD011507, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and diseaseD005198. Renal biopsy was conducted on 22 9606 who qualified. Data were analysed using SPSS package version 23. RESULTS: Thirty-seven (35.2%) of the 105 9606 had diseaseD051436, as defined by an eGFR of 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 and/or diseaseD011507. The fractional excretion of potassium (FEK) was elevated in all 9606, whereas the fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) was elevated in 98.1%. Glomerular filtration rate was negatively correlated with irreversible percentage sickle cell count (r = -0.616, P = 0.0001), FEK (r = -0.448, P = 0.0001) and FENa (r = -0.336, P = 0.004). Age, irreversible percentage sickle cell count, haemoglobin levels and FENa were the major predictors of diseaseD051436. The histological pattern in the 22 9606 who had biopsies was consistent with diseaseD005921 11 (50%), diseaseD009402 6 (27.3%), diseaseD005923 3 (13.6%) and diseaseD009395 2 (9.1%). CONCLUSIONS: diseaseD051436 was prevalent in diseaseD000755 9606, and it was characterised by diseaseD005198 and diseaseD005921. The main predictors of diseaseD051436 were increased age, severity of diseaseD001157, worsening diseaseD000743 and diseaseD005198.
38418238		Sickle Eye Project: a cross-sectional, non-interventional study of the prevalence of diseaseD014786 due to diseaseD000755 and diseaseD008268 in the UK.INTRODUCTION: diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755) is one of the most common diseaseD030342 in the UK, with over 15 000 people affected. diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755) is a well-described complication of diseaseD000755 and can result in significant diseaseD016388, although the prevalence in the UK is not currently known. There are currently no national screening guidelines for diseaseD000755, with wide variations in the management of the condition across the UK. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Sickle Eye Project is an epidemiological, cross-sectional, non-interventional study to determine the prevalence of diseaseD014786 due to diseaseD000755 and/or diseaseD008268 in the UK. Haematologists in at least 16 geographically dispersed hospitals in the UK linked to participating eye clinics will offer study participation to consecutive 9606 meeting the inclusion criteria attending the diseaseD000755 clinic. The following study procedures will be performed: (a) best corrected visual acuity with habitual correction and pinhole, (b) dilated slit lamp biomicroscopy and funduscopy, (c) optical coherence tomography (OCT), (d) OCT angiography where available, (e) ultrawide fundus photography, (f) National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire-25 and (g) acceptability of retinal screening questionnaire. The primary outcome is the proportion of people with diseaseD000755 with diseaseD014786 defined as logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution >=0.3 in at least one eye. Secondary outcomes include the prevalence of each stage of diseaseD000755 and presence of diseaseD008268 by age and genotype; correlation of stage of diseaseD000755 and diseaseD008268 to severity of diseaseD000755; the impact of diseaseD000755 and presence of diseaseD008268 on vision-related quality of life; and the acceptability to 9606 of routine retinal imaging for diseaseD000755 and diseaseD008268. diseaseD009103: Ethical approval was obtained from the South Central-Oxford A Research Ethics Committee (REC 23/SC/0363). Findings will be reported through academic journals in ophthalmology and haematology.

38409146		The Evaluation of Invasive Prenatal Diagnostic Tests in North Cyprus: A Retrospective Study.BACKGROUND: diseaseD030342 are still an important medical, social, and economic problem all over the world. In North Cyprus, in addition to other reasons, early prenatal diagnostic measures are undertaken to prevent births with diseaseD017086, a locally widespread diseaseD030342. AIM: This study aims to evaluate the results of prenatal invasive diagnostic tests performed in a private obstetrics clinic in Northern Cyprus and show the diagnosis process of diseaseD013789 and diseaseD002869. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study is a retrospective, descriptive study. Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) results and the amniocentesis tests performed between 1990 and 2022 are evaluated. diseaseD013789 and chromosome analysis of samples obtained by CVS and amniocentesis tests were performed. To diagnose diseaseD017086 and diseaseD000755, 239 CVS was performed. And to diagnose diseaseD002869, 396 CVS and amniocentesis were performed. RESULTS: The mean age of the 480 pregnant 9606 included in the study was 31.12 years (18-46) and 30% of them were older than 34 years. The most common indications for invasive prenatal diagnostic test (IPDT) were; mother/father diseaseD017086, advanced maternal age, high risk of ultrasonography erase findings, and the noninvasive screening test. The result of IPDT detected 7.3% diseaseD002869 and 69.5% diseaseD013789 and diseaseD000755. Of the 239 CVS performed to diagnose diseaseC567100 and diseaseD000755, 23.4% beta major, 42.3% diseaseD017086, and 2.1% alpha minor were diagnosed. Of the 396 CVS and amniocentesis performed to diagnose diseaseD025063; 2.8% of diseaseD004314 and 4.54% of other diseaseD002869 were diagnosed. CONCLUSION: IPDT is important in correctly diagnosing diseaseD000013 at the prenatal stage to help families decide at the right time.
38422317		Transfusion of packed red blood cells in adults with diseaseD000755 treated at an emergency hospital.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze the prescription of packed red blood cells performed by emergency physicians for adults with diseaseD000755. METHODS: Transfusions performed in adults with diseaseD000755 treated at an emergency service in Sao Bernardo do Campo, Sao Paulo Brazil, between January 2018 and January 2022 were evaluated. For data comparison, the chi-square2 test was used. The significance level adopted was 5%. RESULTS: A total of 114 transfusions were performed. The mean age was 41.8+-16.4 years, and pretransfusion hemoglobin was 6.1+-1.23 g/dL. Regarding the indication, the adequacy of transfusions performed in symptomatic individuals was significantly higher compared to asymptomatic individuals (100% vs. 3.9%, p<0.001). Symptomatic individuals received excessive volumes of packed red blood cells less frequently than asymptomatic individuals (17.5% vs. 56.9%, p<0.001). The filtered subtype, indicated for diseaseD000755, was prescribed in only a quarter of the 9606. However, non-indicated subtypes were frequently prescribed. CONCLUSION: This study found low adequacy in the indication and calculation of the transfusion volume of packed red blood cells in asymptomatic individuals. Few 9606 received filtered red blood cells, resulting in increased risks of transfusion reactions. On the contrary, non-indicated subtypes were prescribed in a quarter of transfusions, which resulted in higher costs and delay in receiving packed red blood cells.
