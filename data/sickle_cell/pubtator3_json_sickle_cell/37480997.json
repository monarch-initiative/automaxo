            "text": "OBJECTIVE: To compare the measurement of aortic diameters using a novel flow-independent MR-Angiography (3D modified Relaxation-Enhanced Angiography without Contrast and Triggering (modified REACT)) and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) in Marfan syndrome (MFS) patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective, single-center analysis included 46 examinations of 32 MFS patients (mean age 37.5 +- 11.3 years, 17 women, no prior aortic surgery) who received TTE and 3D modified REACT (ECG- and respiratory-triggering, Compressed SENSE factor 9 for acceleration of image acquisition) of the thoracic aorta. Aortic diameters (sinus of Valsalva (SV), sinotubular junction (STJ), and ascending aorta (AoA)) were independently measured by two cardiologists in TTE (leading-edge) and two radiologists in modified REACT (inner-edge, using multiplanar reconstruction). Intraclass correlation coefficient, Bland-Altman analyses, and Pearson's correlation (r) were used to assess agreement between observers and methods. RESULTS: Interobserver correlation at the SV, STJ, and AoA were excellent for both, TTE (ICC = 0.95-0.98) and modified REACT (ICC = 0.99-1.00). There was no significant difference between TTE and modified REACT for diameters measured at the SV (39.24 +- 3.24 mm vs. 39.63 +- 3.76 mm; p = 0.26; r = 0.78) and the STJ (35.16 +- 4.47 mm vs. 35.37 +- 4.74 mm; p = 0.552; r = 0.87). AoA diameters determined by TTE were larger than in modified REACT (34.29 +- 5.31 mm vs. 30.65 +- 5.64 mm; p < 0.01; r = 0.74). The mean scan time of modified REACT was 05:06 min +- 02:47 min, depending on the patient's breathing frequency and heart rate. CONCLUSIONS: Both TTE and modified REACT showed a strong correlation for all aortic levels; however, at the AoA, diameters were larger using TTE, mostly due to the limited field of view of the latter with measurements being closer to the aortic valve. Given the excellent interobserver correlation and the strong agreement with TTE, modified REACT represents an attractive method to depict the thoracic aorta in MFS patients.",
