36575623		Quantitative analysis of choriocapillaris flow deficits and choroidal thickness in children with Marfan syndrome.PURPOSE: To evaluate the characteristics and associated factors of choroidal thickness (ChT) and choriocapillaris flow deficit percentage (CC FD%) in children with Marfan syndrome (MFS). METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study. The ChT of the subfoveal area and other areas 0.5, 1.5, and 2.5 mm away from the fovea were assessed. The CC FD% of quadrant and circular regions with diameters of 0.5, 1.5 and 2.5 mm were assessed with 3x3 mm macular choriocapillaris images. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and cardiac function factor such as Z score were measured to analyse the associations with ChT and CC FD%. RESULTS: 51 MFS children and 50 healthy controls were enrolled in this study. Compared with the healthy controls, the ChT in the MFS group was thinner in the subfoveal area, temporal 0.5, 1.5 and 2.5 mm (all p<0.001). The CC FD% was higher in circle 0.5, 1.5 and 2.5 mm (all p<0.001). Multivariate regression analysis showed that CC FD% in the circle 2.5 mm when the Z score >=2 was associated with BCVA (beta=9.08 (95% CI 3.96 to 14.20); p=0.005) and Z score (beta=4.19 (95% CI 1.28 to 12.00); p=0.012). CONCLUSIONS: Thinner ChT and a higher CC FD% were observed in children with MFS, and an increased CC FD% in circle 2.5 mm was significantly associated with worse BCVA and cardiac function. These findings may help identify future visual impairment and early cardiac events in MFS children.
35416099		Microvascular Retinal Changes in Patients with Marfan Syndrome.PURPOSE: To determine microvascular changes in patients with genetically proven Marfan syndrome. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, 32 eyes of 16 patients with genetically proven Marfan syndrome were evaluated using swept-source optical coherence tomography angiography (SS-OCTA). Patients were analyzed regarding lens status and systemic vascular disease. The foveal avascular zone (FAZ) and vessel density (VD) of the superficial and deep vascular plexus and central retinal thickness (CRT) were evaluated on SS-OCTA. RESULTS: 44/56% patients presented without/with subluxation of the lens. 69% of patients had presence of mitral valve insufficiency, aortic dilatation or aneurysm of the aortic root. In patients with Marfan syndrome the mean area of the FAZ was 0.2 +- 0.1 mm and the average VD of the superficial/deep vascular plexus was 36 +- 5%/22 +- 7%. In patients with subluxation of the lens FAZ area and perimeter were larger when compared to patients without subluxation of the lens (0.18 +- 0.08/0.28 +- 0.10 mm and 1.7 +- 0.4/2.3 +- 0.8; p = 0.02). VD of the superficial vascular plexus was reduced in patients with subluxation of the lens (on average 39 +- 3/33 +- 8; p = 0.01) together with an increased CRT in the inner segments of the ETDRS grid when compared to patients without subluxation of the lens. In patients with systemic vascular disease a larger FAZ area (0.19 +- 0.06/0.25 +- 0.1 mm; p = 0.04) and reduced VD of the superficial vascular plexus in the central ETDRS grid (28 +- 7/21 +- 6; p = 0.02) was observed in comparison to patients without systemic vascular changes. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with Marfan syndrome SS-OCTA imaging revealed microvascular differences in patients with lens subluxation and/or systemic vascular disease.
37505267		Abnormal Left Ventricular Strain Correlates with Left Ventricular Dysfunction but not Aortic Pathology in Marfan Syndrome in Children.Cardiomyopathy is a complication in adults with Marfan syndrome (MFS). Early recognition of MFS patients at high risk of cardiomyopathy could impact monitoring and treatment. Abnormal ventricular strain has been associated with impaired ventricular function among adults with MFS but remains understudied in children. We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of patients with MFS undergoing cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) performed in 2003-2018 at age < 19 years. Correlations were evaluated between initial global circumferential strain (GCS) and global longitudinal strain (GLS) and the outcomes of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), aortic root z-score, and vertebral artery tortuosity index corrected for height (VTI-h), all measured from CMR, using Spearman correlation. In those with serial CMR, the ability of ventricular strain to predict development of abnormal LVEF within a 5-year period was assessed. A total of 31 subjects were included (median age at initial CMR 13.5 years, Q1Q3 10.7-16.2 years), with 48% (n = 15) having LVEF < 55%. Worse GCS and worse GLS were associated with lower LVEF (rho = - 0.629, p < 0.001 and rho = - 0.411, p = 0.030, respectively). A clinical cutoff of GCS = - 34% predicted LVEF < 55% with sensitivity = 80% and specificity = 50%. Neither GCS nor GLS was associated with aortic root z-score (GCS: p = 0.524; GLS: p = 0.624) nor VTI-h (GCS: p = 0.949; GLS: p = 0.593). Of those with LVEF >= 55%, initial GCS and GLS did not differ between those with later normal versus abnormal LVEF (GCS: p = 0.505; GLS: p = 0.232). In this cohort, abnormal LV strain was associated with abnormal LVEF, but not with aortic dilation or low LVEF within the 5 years post-CMR.
35348237		Current trends in minimally invasive valve-sparing aortic root replacement-Best available evidence.BACKGROUND: Valve-sparing aortic root replacement such as the reimplantation (David) procedure is becoming increasingly popular. Despite the fact that the procedure is technically more complex, long-term studies demonstrated that excellent clinical outcomes in selected patients with durable repair are achievable. Benefits of minimal access cardiac surgery have stimulated enthusiasm in the use of this access for valve-sparing aortic root replacement. METHODS: We have reviewed available literature on the topic of valve-sparing aortic root replacement (David procedure) via minimally invasive access through upper hemisternotomy in an attempt to assess current trends and to recognize potential advantages of this technique. Patient selection and preoperative work-up play important role in performing minimally invasive David procedure safely. Surgical technique corresponds to the standard David procedure, with a few exceptions related to the minimal access, and is performed via upper ministernotomy. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Evidence from nonrandomized observational and comparative studies demonstrated excellent clinical outcomes of minimally invasive David procedure in selected patients with comparable perioperative mortality and outcomes to the conventional technique. To date, David procedure with a minimal access technique has been performed in carefully selected patients. We believe it could be particularly beneficial to provide younger patients (Marfan syndrome and bicuspid aortic valve) with minimally invasive David procedure as it can allow faster recovery with improved cosmesis with excellent outcomes. A decision to perform minimally invasive David procedure should be individualized to each patient and based on the experience of the team. Further large prospective randomized studies with long-term follow-up are still needed to confirm durability of minimal access technique.
36208932		Unique robotic vascular surgery procedures.INTRODUCTION: Based on their experience with robot-assisted vascular surgery, the authors present some unique types of procedures they have performed in this area. METHODS: From November 2005 to February 2022, a total of 560 robotic vascular procedures were performed, of which 70 were orphan operations, corresponding to 12.5%. The most common was robotic decompression of the coeliac trunk (18 times) in Dunbar syndrome, followed by robotic repair of type II endoleak after stent graft implantation (15 times) and robotic repair of splenic artery aneurysm (11 times). Less common were isolated pelvic artery aneurysm surgery (8 times), aortic thromboenderectomy and abdominal aortic patch repair (8 times) and hybrid surgery (6 times). Completely unique are renal artery reconstruction (2 times), operation of internal mammary artery aneurysm (1 time) in a patient with Marfan syndrome and paracaval biopsy (1 time) in a cancer patient. RESULTS: In 3 cases (4.2%) the operation had to be converted to open surgery. Twice in the management of splenic artery aneurysm due to flat adhesions in the abdominal cavity and once in the endoleak operation, when due to the very fragile wall of the dilated and pulsating abdominal aortic aneurysm sac, we considered manipulation with robotic instruments to be highly risky. There was zero mortality in this cohort; one patient had to undergo laparoscopic diaphragm repair for diaphragmatic hernia at another institution after deliberation of the coeliac trunk and in one case open surgery was needed for persistent endoleak. CONCLUSION: The use of the robotic system can be beneficial also in less frequent procedures, offering the patients all the advantages of robotic surgery. However, the need of extensive experience in robotic surgery should be emphasized because these operations are rare and perfect anatomical knowledge of the area is necessary.
36411030	associate|@DISEASE_Marfan_Syndrome|@GENE_FBN1 ;associate|@DISEASE_Greig_cephalopolysyndactyly_syndrome|@GENE_GLI3	Conclusion of diagnostic odysseys due to inversions disrupting GLI3 and FBN1.Many genetic testing methodologies are biased towards picking up structural variants (SVs) that alter copy number. Copy-neutral rearrangements such as inversions are therefore likely to suffer from underascertainment. In this study, manual review prompted by a virtual multidisciplinary team meeting and subsequent bioinformatic prioritisation of data from the 100K Genomes Project was performed across 43 genes linked to well-characterised skeletal disorders. Ten individuals from three independent families were found to harbour diagnostic inversions. In two families, inverted segments of 1.2/14.8 Mb unequivocally disrupted GLI3 and segregated with skeletal features consistent with Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome. For one family, phenotypic blending was due to the opposing breakpoint lying ~45 kb from HOXA13 In the third family, long suspected to have Marfan syndrome, a 2.0 Mb inversion disrupting FBN1 was identified. These findings resolved lengthy diagnostic odysseys of 9-20 years and highlight the importance of direct interaction between clinicians and data-analysts. These exemplars of a rare mutational class inform future SV prioritisation strategies within the NHS Genomic Medicine Service and similar genome sequencing initiatives. In over 30 years since these two disease-gene associations were identified, large inversions have yet to be described and so our results extend the mutational spectra linked to these conditions.
35871643		Surgical outcomes associated with sleep apnea syndrome in Stanford A aortic dissection patients.BACKGROUND: Patients suffering from aortic dissection (AD) often experience sleep apnea syndrome (SAS), which aggravates their respiratory function and aortic false lumen expansion. METHODS: We analyzed the peri-operative data of Stanford A AD patients, with or without SAS, between January 2017 and June 2019. Subjects were separated into SAS positive (SAS+) and SAS negative (SAS-) cohorts, based on the Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) and the Oxygen Desaturation Index (ODI). We next analyzed variables between the SAS+ and SAS- groups. RESULTS: 155, out of 198 AAD patients, were enlisted for this study. SAS+ patients exhibited higher rates of pneumonia (p < 0.001), heart failure (HF, p = 0.038), acute kidney injury (AKI, p = 0.001), ventilation time (p = 0.009), and hospitalization duration (p < 0.001). According to subsequent follow-ups, the unstented aorta false lumen dilatation (FLD) rate increased markedly, with increasing degree of SAS (p < 0.001, according to AHI and ODI). The SAS+ patients exhibited worse cumulative survival rate (p = 0.025). The significant risk factors (RF) for poor survival were: severe (p = 0.002) or moderate SAS (p = 0.008), prolonged ventilation time (p = 0.018), AKI (p = 0.015), HF New York Heart Association (NYHA) IV (p = 0.005) or III (p = 0.015), pneumonia (p = 0.005), Marfan syndrome (p = 0.010), systolic blood pressure (BP) upon arrival (p = 0.009), and BMI >= 30 (p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: SAS+ Stanford A AD patients primarily exhibited higher rates of complications and low survival rates in the mid-time follow-up. Hence, the RFs associated with poor survival must be monitored carefully in SAS patients. Moreover, the FLD rate is related to the degree of SAS, thus treating SAS may mitigate FLD.
35410839		Endovascular aortic repair in a patient with Marfan syndrome: A case report.
35400268		Acute dissection into a large abdominal aortic aneurysm in a patient with Marfan syndrome.OBJECTIVES: Synchronous aortic dissection (AD) with involvement of pre-existing infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are fortunately rare. Extension of the dissection flap to involve the aneurysm is particularly dangerous with pressurization of the false lumen within a diseased aortic wall. The aim of this article is to present a unique case of an acute AD with extension to involve a large AAA in a patient with an underlying connective tissue disorder. METHODS: A 24-year-old male Marfan syndrome patient with prior type A dissection repair presented with a descending thoracic AD and a separate 7.0-cm infrarenal AAA. He was initially medically managed but developed acute extension of the dissection flap to involve the large aneurysm. RESULTS: The patient was initially treated with open infrarenal aortic replacement under left atrialfemoral artery bypass. Three years later, he developed degeneration of the residual aorta and underwent a two-stage hybrid repair. He underwent an additional stent graft for a distal anastomotic leak. At 5 years of follow-up, there was positive aneurysm remodeling and sac regression. CONCLUSION: This case illustrates the challenges in treating a patient with synchronous aortic processes. False lumen pressurization of a large aneurysm wall is fortunately rare but can be lethal. Prompt intervention is required but the presence of an underlying connective tissue disorder may limit endovascular treatment options. Careful case planning is mandatory and multiple interventions should be anticipated.
36534925		Redo aortic arch replacement through a second transcostal approach for closure of type 1A endoleak after endovascular treatment of type B aortic dissection in Marfan syndrome.A 41-year-old woman with Marfan syndrome suffering from chronic expanding type A dissection of the distal aortic arch and pectus excavatum underwent aortic arch replacement through a left parasternal approach. We demonstrate that this approach is also feasible in complex redo surgery on the aortic arch in selected patients.
37391518		Cervical kyphosis correction in Marfan syndrome: our experience and literature review.BACKGROUND: Spinal deformities are common in Marfan syndrome (MFS). They usually involve the thoraco-lumbar spine but rarely involves the cervical spine. Kyphosis is the common spine deformity of the cervical spine and mandates surgical correction as they are at risk of neurological deterioration since they are refractory to conservative management. Few studies of surgical correction of spine deformity included cervical deformity. OBJECTIVES: To analyze the challenges faced during surgery, clinical and radiological outcome, and complications following surgical correction for cervical kyphosis in Marfan syndrome. METHODS: We identified that 5 patients with a diagnosis of MFS with cervical kyphosis who underwent fusion surgery between the years 2010 and 2022 were reviewed, retrospectively. We analyzed the demographic details, radiological parameters, operative variables (blood loss and nuances), perioperative complications, length of stay, clinical and radiological outcome, and complications following fusion surgery for cervical kyphosis in MFS. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 16.6 +- 4.72 years (range, 12-23 years). The average kyphotic vertebra involved is 3 +- 0.7 bodies (range 2-4) with 2 patients with thoracic deformity. All patients underwent surgical deformity correction. All patients improved clinically with Nurick grade (pre vs. post: 3.4 vs. 2.2) and mJOA (pre vs. post: 8.2 vs. 12.6). There was significant deformity correction from 37.48  to 9.1 . Mean blood loss encountered was 900 +- 173.2 ml. Perioperative complications: wound complication with CSF leak (1). Late complications: ventilator dependence (1) and junctional kyphosis (1). Mean length of hospital stay was 103 +- 178.9 days. All patients were doing symptomatically better after mean follow-up of 58 +- 28.32 months. One patient is bedridden and hospitalized. CONCLUSION: Cervical kyphosis is a rare spine deformity in patients with MFS, and they usually present with neurological deterioration mandating surgical correction. Multidisciplinary approach (pediatrics, genetics and cardiology) is required for systematic evaluation of these patients. They should be evaluated with necessary imaging to rule out associated spinal deformity (atlanto-axial subluxation, scoliosis, and intraspinal pathology like ductal ectasia). Our results suggest better surgical outcome in terms of low operative complications with neurologic improvement in MFS patients. These patients require regular follow-up to identify late complications (instrument failure, non-union, and pseudarthrosis).
38302121		Disease-Modifying Therapies for Sickle Cell Disease-An Overview.Sickle cell disease refers to a group of inherited blood disorders in which hemoglobin polymerization leads to hemolysis and vaso-occlusion. This causes a myriad of complications during a patient's life span, ranging from anemia, infections, and acute and chronic pain to stroke and multiorgan dysfunction. Although there have been dramatic improvements in childhood survival thanks to improved supportive care with penicillin prophylaxis, immunizations, and improved transfusion practices, there was a dearth of disease-modifying therapies, with hydroxyurea being the only medication for >20 years. Here, we discuss the newer therapies for sickle cell disease that have emerged in recent years. [Pediatr Ann. 2024;53(2):e52-e55.].
37164052		Risk profile and operative outcomes in patients with and without Marfan syndrome undergoing thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair.OBJECTIVES: To compare operative and long-term outcomes between patients with and without Marfan syndrome undergoing thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair. METHODS: We identified all consecutive patients undergoing thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair between 1997 and 2022. Primary outcome was composite of major adverse events. Secondary outcomes were individual complications and long-term survival. Inverse probability of treatment weighting was performed. Weighted Kaplan-Meier curves were used to estimate long-term survival. Multivariable analysis identified factors associated with major adverse events. RESULTS: Six hundred eighty-four patients underwent open thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair. Ninety (13.1%) had Marfan syndrome, whereas 594 (86.9%) did not. Marfan patients were younger (46 years [range, 36-56 years] vs 69 years [range, 61-76 years]; P < .001). Extent II or III aneurysms (57 out of 90 [63.3%] vs 211 out of 594 [35.6%]; P < .001) and type I or III chronic dissection (77 out of 90 [85.3%] vs 242 out of 594 [40.8%]; P < .001) were more common. Cardiovascular risk factors were less frequent in Marfan patients. There was no difference in major adverse events between groups (12 out of 90 [13.3%] vs 100 out of 594 [16.8%]; P = .49). Operative mortality was similar between groups (3 out of 90 [3.3%] vs 28 out of 594 [4.7%]; P = .75). Unweighted survival at 10 years was 78.7% vs 46.8% (P = .001). Weighted Kaplan-Meier curves showed no difference in long-term survival (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.32-1.99; P = .62; Log-rank P = .12). At multivariable analysis, renal insufficiency (odds ratio, 2.29; 95% CI, 1.43-3.68; P < .01) and urgent/emergency procedure (odds ratio, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.35-3.48; P < .01) were associated with major adverse events, whereas Marfan syndrome was not (odds ratio, 1.56; 95% CI, 0.69-3.49; P = .28). CONCLUSIONS: Open thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair can be performed with similar operative outcomes in patients with and without Marfan syndrome despite differing risk profiles. Operative/perioperative strategies must be tailored to specific needs of each patient to optimize outcomes.

35863645		Strategies for Treatment of Multiple Brain Aneurysms Without Intraoperative Adjuncts.BACKGROUND: Although fairly rare, multiple brain aneurysms are well known to occur in certain conditions such as arteriovenous malformations, coarctation of the aorta, renal artery stenosis, adult type 3 polycystic kidney disease, as well as connective tissue disorders (such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Marfan syndrome, and fibromuscular dysplasia). Increased incidence of complications of surgery in such situations is expected to be more likely than in surgery for a single aneurysm, particularly in the absence of intraoperative guidance with adjuncts. METHODS: We report a case of an anterior communicating artery aneurysm, a right middle cerebral artery aneurysm, and a right pericallosal aneurysm in a 70-year-old man. All 3 aneurysms were clipped through a single-stage approach without the aid of any adjuncts such as micro-Doppler ultrasonography, indocyanine green videoangiography, or intraoperative digital subtraction angiography. We carried out a literature review for past publications on similar reports. RESULTS: The patient made a complete postoperative recovery and sustained no neurologic deficits. Out of 388 publications from the literature search, only 1 case report described clipping of 2 tandem aneurysms in a 60-year-old woman without mentioning any intraoperative adjuncts. CONCLUSIONS: This case illustrates that multiple aneurysms can actually be safely operated with adequate planning in the absence of these adjuncts, especially in resource-poor regions. This is particularly crucial in Africa and most low-and-middle-income countries, where such facilities and equipment are not common.

36579861		Twenty-year experience of aortic valve reimplantation using the Valsalva graft.OBJECTIVES: Over the past 20 years, valve-sparing aortic root replacement has aroused increasing interest because of a progressive attitude towards the preservation of natural tissue. Aortic reimplantation is the most used technique to spare the valve, allowing simultaneously aortic root replacement and aortic annular stabilization. The reimplantation into a graft with sinuses guarantees an optimal anatomic and functional reconstruction with established good results at 15 years. The aim of this study is to report the world longest follow-up (up to 20 years) of aortic valve reimplantation using the Valsalva graft. METHODS: From February 2000 to December 2021, 265 consecutive patients with aortic root aneurysm received aortic valve reimplantation using the Valsalva graft. From 2018, leaflet plication with the routine use of calliper was performed. For each patient, we performed both intraoperative and post-procedural transoesophageal echocardiography. All patients were followed with clinical assessment and echocardiography. The mean duration of follow-up was 85 +- 63 months. RESULTS: The study cohort had a median age of 55 +- 18 and 87.2% were male. The aortic root aneurysm was associated to bicuspid aortic valve in 18.9% of patients and to Marfan syndrome in 10.6% of cases. 55.9% had an aortic regurgitation >= 2+. Overall survival at 15 was 87.6 +- 3.4. Freedom from cardiac death was stable at 99.6 +- 0.4 at 5, 10 and 15 years. Freedom from recurrent AR >=3+ and freedom from reoperation remained stable at 10 and 15 years at 92.2 +- 2.1 and 95.9 +- 1.6, respectively. There was a minimal incidence of infective endocarditis (0.8%), thromboembolism (2.2%) and haemorrhage (2.0%). Six out of 7 patients requiring reoperation had surgery in the first period of our experience (last in 2004). Early suboptimal results had a negative effect on residual aortic regurgitation. Moreover, we hypothesized that the routine use of calliper may have contributed to a further improvement of the outcome, even if these data need to be confirmed by a longer follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The first long-term follow-up after aortic valve reimplantation using the Valsalva graft demonstrated excellent results. These long-term results gradually improved with learning curve, remaining stable during the second decade of observation. The systematic use of calliper may have contributed to a further improvement of the outcome.
38308541		Adverse pregnancy, fetal and neonatal outcomes in women with sickle cell disease in a Middle Eastern country.BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease in pregnancy is associated with high maternal and fetal mortality. However, studies reporting pregnancy, fetal, and neonatal outcomes in women with sickle cell disease are extremely limited. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of the study are to determine whether women with sickle cell disease have a greater risk of adverse pregnancy, fetal, and neonatal outcomes than women without sickle cell disease and identify the predictors of adverse pregnancy, fetal, and neonatal outcomes in women with sickle cell disease. DESIGN: A retrospective pair-matched case-control study was conducted to compare 171 pregnant women with sickle cell disease to 171 pregnant women without sickle cell disease in Muscat, Sultanate of Oman. METHODS: All pregnant Omani women with sickle cell disease who delivered between January 2015 and August 2021 at Sultan Qaboos University Hospital and Royal Hospital, who were either primipara or multipara and who had a gestational age of 24-42 weeks, were included as patients, whereas women who had no sickle cell disease or any comorbidity during pregnancy, who delivered within the same timeframe and at the same hospitals, were recruited as controls. The data were retrieved from electronic medical records and delivery registry books between January 2015 and August 2021. RESULTS: Women with sickle cell disease who had severe anemia had increased odds of (chi2 = 58.56, p < 0.001) having adverse pregnancy outcomes. Women with sickle cell disease had 21.97% higher odds of delivering a baby with intrauterine growth retardation (chi2 = 17.80, unadjusted odds ratio = 2.91-166.13, p < 0.001). Newborns born to women with sickle cell disease had 3.93% greater odds of being admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (chi2 = 16.80, unadjusted odds ratio = 1.97-7.84, p < 0.001). In addition, the children born to women with sickle cell disease had 10.90% higher odds of being born with low birth weight (chi2 = 56.92, unadjusted odds ratio = 5.36-22.16, p < 0.001). Hemoglobin level (odds ratio = 0.17, p < 0.001, 95% confidence interval = 0.10-3.0), past medical history (odds ratio = 7.95, p < 0.001, 95% confidence interval = 2.39-26.43), past surgical history (odds ratio = 17.69, p < 0.001, 95% confidence interval = 3.41-91.76), and preterm delivery (odds ratio = 9.48, p = 0.005, 95% confidence interval = 1.95-46.23) were identified as predictors of adverse pregnancy, fetal, and neonatal outcomes in women with sickle cell disease. CONCLUSION: As pregnant women with sickle cell disease are at increased risk for pregnancy, fetal, and neonatal adverse outcomes; improved antenatal surveillance and management may improve the outcomes.
38331925		Role of hydroxyurea therapy in the prevention of organ damage in sickle cell disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.BACKGROUND: Hydroxyurea is an affordable drug that reduces vaso-occlusive crises and transfusion requirements in sickle cell disease. However, its effectiveness in preventing chronic organ damage is still unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the role of hydroxyurea in preventing organ morbidity. METHOD: We included original articles published in English from 1st January 1990 to 31st January 2023, reporting hydroxyurea therapy and organ damage from PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, and CrossRef databases. A total of 45 studies with 4681 sickle cell disease patients were evaluated for organ damage. RESULTS: Our analysis showed that hydroxyurea intervention significantly lowered transcranial Doppler and tricuspid regurgitant velocity, with a standardized mean difference of - 1.03 (- 1.49; - 0.58); I 2 = 96% and - 1.37 (CI - 2.31, - 0.42); I 2 = 94%, respectively. Moreover, the pooled estimate for albuminuria showed a beneficial effect post-hydroxyurea therapy by reducing the risk of albuminuria by 58% (risk ratio of 0.42 (0.28; 0.63); I 2 = 28%). CONCLUSION: Our study found that a hydroxyurea dose above 20 mg/kg/day with a mean rise in HbF by 18.46% post-hydroxyurea therapy had a beneficial role in reducing transcranial doppler velocity, tricuspid regurgitant velocity, albuminuria, and splenic abnormality.

35584950		Scattered Media Elastic Fibers from the Aortic Root to the Ascending Aorta in a 30-Year-Old Marfan Syndrome Patient.We present a case report of a 30-year-old Marfan syndrome patient who underwent a David procedure for severe aortic valve insufficiency and Valsalva aneurysm. Harvested aortic walls were examined by pathologists. Although the tunica media of the ascending aorta contained aligned elastic fibers, the aortic root media lacked aligned elastic fibers.
37840436	associate|@DISEASE_Marfan_Syndrome|@GENE_FBN1	A novel de novo intragenic duplication in FBN1 associated with early-onset Marfan syndrome in a 16-month-old: A case report and review of the literature.Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder due to pathogenic variants in Fibrillin-1 (FBN1) affecting nearly one in every 10,000 individuals. We report a 16-month-old female with early-onset MFS heterozygous for an 11.2 kb de novo duplication within the FBN1 gene. Tandem location of the duplication was further confirmed by optical genome mapping in addition to genetic sequencing and chromosomal microarray. This is the third reported case of a large multi-exon duplication in FBN1, and the only one confirmed to be in tandem. As the vast majority of pathogenic variants associated with MFS are point mutations, this expands the landscape of known FBN1 pathogenic variants and supports consistent use of genetic testing strategies that can detect large, indel-type variants.
35908146		Surgical outcome of scoliosis in patients with Marfan syndrome.PURPOSE: To evaluate clinical and radiographic outcomes after surgical scoliosis correction and posterior instrumented fusion in SMF patients. METHODS: A single-center medical database was reviewed to identify MF patients who presented with scoliosis from 2000 to 2015. Patients who underwent spinal fusion surgery were included. Demographic, operative and clinical data were reviewed, and the preoperative, postoperative, and latest follow-up radiographic parameters were compared. RESULTS: Twelve patients were identified (2 males, 10 females) with an average age at surgery of 14.4 +- 2.6 years. Comorbidities were found in 84.6%. Most patients (90.9%) presented with a right thoracic curve. The average preoperative Cobb angle was 75.6 +- 15.5 degrees. Posterior instrumented spinal fusion was performed in all patients (1 hook/pedicular screw and 11 pedicle screws only). The average follow-up period was 6.8 +- 3.1 years. The mean postoperative Cobb angle after surgery and at the final follow-up was 33.4 +- 18.0 degrees and 35.5 +- 18.4 degrees, respectively. There was a statistically significant difference among the preoperative and postoperative Cobb angles (p < 0.001), but no significant difference among the sagittal angles. Two perioperative complications including superficial wound infection and broken rods were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Posterior scoliosis correction and instrumented spinal fusion resulted in a satisfactory outcome in MF patients. Perioperative complications are not uncommon; however, no neurological complication or spinal decompensation was observed in this study. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV.
35550817		Prevalence and Outcomes of Primary Left Ventricular Dysfunction in Marfan Syndrome.Even in the absence of significant valvular disease, patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS) have evidence of impaired left ventricular (LV) performance, suggestive of a primary cardiomyopathy. However, the true prevalence and long-term outcomes of this disease process remain largely unknown. We performed a retrospective analysis of all adult patients with confirmed MFS followed at Stanford Health Care. Those with significant valvular regurgitation, coronary artery disease, or previous cardiac surgery were excluded. LV systolic dysfunction was defined as a LV ejection fraction (LVEF) <55% on transthoracic echocardiography. A total of 753 patients with confirmed MFS were followed up over a median duration of 8 years (interquartile range 4 to 13). Of those, 241 patients (53% women, 71% White) met inclusion criteria and comprised the study cohort. LV systolic dysfunction was present in 30 patients (12%), with a median age of onset of 25 years (interquartile range 19 to 37), median EF of 52% (interquartile range 48 to 54), and evidence of clinical heart failure (New York Heart Association functional class >=II) in 10% of patients. LV systolic dysfunction was more common in patients with larger aortic root diameters (>=4.0 cm: Odds ratio = 4.5, 95% confidence interval = 1.2 to 17.1) but was not associated with other cardiovascular manifestations of MFS or traditional atherosclerotic risk factors. In conclusion, apart from significant valvular pathology, LV systolic dysfunction was prevalent in MFS from a young age, suggestive of a primary cardiomyopathy. LV dysfunction was typically mild and subclinical and occurred more commonly in patients with more pronounced aortopathies.

37119066		Aortic Dissection During Pregnancy and Puerperium: Contemporary Incidence and Outcomes in the United States.Background Aortic dissection (AD) during pregnancy and puerperium is a rare catastrophe with devastating consequences for both parent and fetus. Population-level incidence trends and outcomes remain relatively undetermined. Methods and Results We queried a US population-based health care database, the National Inpatient Sample, and identified all patients with a pregnancy-related AD hospitalization from 2002 to 2017. In total, 472 pregnancy-related AD hospitalizations (mean age, 30.9+-0.6 years) were identified from 68 514 000 pregnancy-related hospitalizations (0.69 per 100 000 pregnancy-related hospitalizations), with 107 (22.7%) being type A and 365 (77.3%) being type B. The incidence of AD appeared to increase over the 16-year study period but was not statistically significant (P for trend >0.05). Marfan syndrome, primary hypertension, and preeclampsia/eclampsia were found in 21.9%, 14.4%, and 11.5%, respectively. On multivariable logistic regression analysis, Marfan syndrome was associated with the highest risk of developing AD during pregnancy and puerperium (adjusted odds ratio, 3469.36 [95% CI, 1767.84-6831.75]; P<0.001). The in-hospital mortalities of AD, type A AD, and type B AD were 7.3%, 4.3%, and 8.1%, respectively. Length of hospital stay for the AD, type A AD, and type B AD groups were 7.7+-0.8, 10.4+-1.9, and 6.9+-0.9 days, respectively. Conclusions We quantified population-level incidence and in-hospital mortality in the United States and observed an increase in the incidence of pregnancy-related AD. In contrast, its in-hospital mortality appears lower than that of non-pregnancy-related AD.
38332569		Research Progress on Aortic Root Aneurysms.Aortic root aneurysms are one of the most common aortic root diseases, involving the aortic valve, aortic sinus, bilateral coronary arteries, and part of the ascending aorta. It is a life-threatening aortic disease with a high mortality rate of approximately 90%, due to aortic aneurysm rupture. Aortic valve insufficiency is one of the most common complications of aortic root aneurysms that can lead to acute left heart failure. The etiology of aortic root aneurysms is not yet completely clear and is mainly related to genetic diseases, such as Marfan syndrome and atherosclerosis. It can also occur secondary to aortic valve stenosis or a bivalve deformity. Surgery is the primary treatment for aortic root aneurysms, and aortic root replacement is a classic surgical method. However, the incidences of perioperative complications and mortality are relatively high, particularly in high-risk patients. In recent years, the anatomical structure of the aortic root has been gradually refined, and an in-depth understanding of root aneurysms has led to individualized treatment methods. Conservative drug therapy (ss-receptor blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers), Bentall and modified Bentall surgeries (Button technology, Cabrol surgery, and modified Cabrol surgery), valve-sparing aortic root replacement (David and Yacoub), personalized external aortic root support, and endovascular intervention therapy have significantly improved the perioperative and long-term survival rates of patients with aortic root aneurysms. However, different treatment methods have their own advantages and disadvantages. This review aimed to summarize the current research progress and treatment of aortic root aneurysms.
37330246		Emergency vascular surgical care in populations with unique physiologic characteristics: Pediatric, pregnant, and frail populations.Vascular surgical emergencies are common in vascular surgical care and require complex decision making and multidisciplinary care. They are especially challenging when they occur in patients with unique physiological characteristics, such as pediatric, pregnant, and frail patients. Among the pediatric and pregnant population, vascular emergencies are rare. This rarity challenges accurate and timely diagnosis of the vascular emergency. This landscape review summarizes these three unique populations' epidemiology and emergency vascular considerations. Understanding the epidemiology is the foundation for accurate diagnosis and subsequent management. Considering each population's unique characteristics is crucial to the emergent vascular surgical interventions decision making. Collaborative and multidisciplinary care is vital in gaining expertise in managing these special populations and achieving optimal patient outcomes.

METHODS: Four male patients with suspected MFS and their family members who were treated at West China Second Hospital of Sichuan University from September 12, 2019 to March 27, 2021 were selected as the study subjects. Peripheral venous blood samples were collected from the patients and their parents or other pedigree members for the extraction of genomic DNA. Whole exome sequencing was carried out, and candidate variants were validated by Sanger sequencing. The pathogenicity of the variants was determined based on the guidelines from the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG). RESULTS: Genetic testing revealed that all four patients have harbored variants of the FBN1 gene, including c.430_433del (p.His144fs) deletional variant in exon 5, c.493C>T (p.Arg165*) nonsense variant in exon 6, c.5304_5306del (p.Asp1768del) deletional variant in exon 44 and c.5165C>G (p.Ser1722Cys) missense variant in exon 42. According to the ACMG guidelines, the c.430_433del and c.493C>T were classified as pathogenic variants (PVS1+PM2_Supporting+PP4; PVS1+PS1+PS2+PM2_Supporting+PP4). c.5304_5306del and c.5165C>G were classified as likely pathogenic variants (PS2+PM2_Supporting+PM4+PP4; PS2_Moderate+PS1+PM1+PM2_Supporting). CONCLUSION: The c.430_433del and c.5304_5306del variants of the FBN1 gene identified in this study were unreported previously. Above results have enriched the variation spectrum of the FBN1 gene and provided a basis for genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis of patients with MFS and acromicric dysplasia.
35388902		Aortic valve reimplantation in patients with connective tissue syndromes: A 15-year follow-up.OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to analyse early- and long-term outcomes of aortic valve reimplantation (David operation) in patients with heritable thoracic aortic disease. METHODS: This is a retrospective observational analysis using data from a prospectively maintained surgical database from March 2004 to April 2021. Patients with heritable thoracic aortic disease were included in the study. RESULTS: A total of 157 patients with aortic root aneurysm with the diagnosis of heritable thoracic aortic disease received the David procedure. Marfan syndrome was found in 143 (91.1%) patients, Loeys-Dietz in 13 and Ehler-Danlos in 1 patient. The median age was 35.0 (IQR: 17.5) years and the median ascending aorta diameter in the Valsalva sinuses was 48 mm (IQR: 4). A Valsalva graft was used in 8 patients; the David V technique was performed in the rest of the cases. The median follow-up time was 7.3 years [standard deviation: 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI): 6.12-8.05]. Only 2 patients died during the follow-up period. The overall survival was 99% (95% CI: 95%; 99%); 98% (95% CI: 92%; 99%); and 98% (95% CI: 92%; 99%) at 5, 10 and 15 years. Freedom from significant aortic regurgitation (AR> II), reintervention and postoperative type-B dissection was 90% (95% CI: 77%; 95%), 96% (95% CI: 91%; 99%) and 87% (95% CI: 68%; 95%) at 15 years, respectively. No differences were found in any outcome between Marfan syndrome and Loeys-Dietz syndrome. No statistically significant differences in survival were found when we compared expected gender- and age-specific population survival values. CONCLUSIONS: The David operation is an excellent option for the treatment of patients with heritable thoracic aortic disease and dilatated aortic root. Surgical expertise in referral centres is essential to achieve the best long-term results.
35360960		Modified Bentall procedure: A 15-year single-center clinical experience.OBJECTIVE: Bentall procedure is a standard technique for complete aortic root replacement but a huge challenge is postoperative bleeding. Many modifications have been proposed and the "button technique" is commonly used. With a 15-year experience, this study was to evaluate outcomes of this modified Bentall procedure. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed with all patients who underwent the Bentall procedure with a button technique between 2005 and 2020. Commercially available composite grafts were used in 38 patients and self-assembled composite graft was used in 74 patients. Safety outcome was postoperative complications and long-term outcomes included overall and reoperation-free survivals. RESULTS: Among 112 patients, the mean age was 46.3 years and 69.6% were men. Indications for the Bentall procedure were ascending aortic aneurysm and valve regurgitation (59.8%), aortic dissection (19.6%), Marfan syndrome (17%), and endocarditis (3.6%). Three patients (2.7%) died in hospital. During a median follow-up period of 42 months, 11 patients died and 7 patients required reoperation. Overall survival and reoperation-free survival were 86.1% and 83.4% at 5 years and 86.1% and 72.6% at 10 years, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The Bentall procedure with a button technique is safe and effective for aortic root replacement. Further investigations are required to improve the feasibility and effectiveness of the procedure.
35512202		Aortic valve reimplantation in patients with Marfan and other connective tissue syndromes: a success story for these patients!
37860854		The David procedure through a right anterior minithoracotomy.A right anterior minithoracotomy is the least-frequently utilized approach in minimally invasive aortic valve surgery; moreover, this access is rarely used for aortic root procedures. With careful patient selection, some technical considerations, e.g. institution of peripheral cardiopulmonary bypass, and a sufficient learning curve, the right anterior minithoracotomy can become a convenient access for surgical interventions on the aortic root. We present the case of a 31-year-old female patient with Marfan syndrome and severe aortic regurgitation due to an aortic root aneurysm. We demonstrate a step-by-step guide through the David procedure via a right anterior minithoracotomy.
37129561		Outcome of Stanford type B dissection in patients with Marfan syndrome.OBJECTIVE: To determine the outcome of Stanford type B aortic dissection in patients with Marfan syndrome and to evaluate aortic diameters at time of dissection as well as the impact of previous aortic root replacement. METHODS: Analysis of all patients with Marfan syndrome fulfilling Ghent criteria seen at this institution since 1995 until 2022. RESULTS: Thirty-six (19%) out of 188 patients with Marfan syndrome suffered from Stanford type B aortic dissection during the study period. Mean aortic diameter at time of dissection was 39.0 mm (95% CI: 35.6-42.3). Mean pre-dissection diameter (available in 25% of patients) was 32.1 mm (95% CI: 28.0-36.3) and mean expansion was 19% (95% CI: 11.9-26.2). There was no correlation between age and diameter at time of dissection (<20, 21-30, 31-40, 41-50, 51-60, <61 years; p = 0.78). Freedom-from-intervention after dissection was 53%, 44%, 33% at 1, 5 and 10 years. Aortic growth rate in those patients that had to undergo intervention within the 1st year after dissection was 10.2 mm/y (95% CI: 4.4-15.9) compared to 5.8 mm/y (95% CI: 3.3-8.3), p = 0.109 in those thereafter. Mean time between dissection and intervention was 1.8 years (95% CI: 0.6-3.0). While type B dissection seems more frequent after previous elective aortic repair (58% vs 42%), there was no difference between valve-sparing root replacement (VSRR) compared to Bentall procedures (HR for VSRR 0.78, 95% CI: 0.31-2.0, p-value = 0.61). Mean age of the entire population at end of follow-up was 42 years (95% CI: 39.2-44.7). Mean follow-up time was 9 years (95% CI: 7.8-10.4). CONCLUSIONS: Stanford type B dissection in patients with Marfan syndrome occurs far below accepted thresholds for intervention. Risk for type B dissection is present throughout lifetime and two third of patients need an intervention after dissection. There is no difference in freedom from type B dissection between a Bentall procedure and a valve-sparing root replacement.
37480997		Thoracic aorta diameters in Marfan patients: Intraindividual comparison of 3D modified relaxation-enhanced angiography without contrast and triggering (REACT) with transthoracic echocardiography.OBJECTIVE: To compare the measurement of aortic diameters using a novel flow-independent MR-Angiography (3D modified Relaxation-Enhanced Angiography without Contrast and Triggering (modified REACT)) and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) in Marfan syndrome (MFS) patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective, single-center analysis included 46 examinations of 32 MFS patients (mean age 37.5 +- 11.3 years, 17 women, no prior aortic surgery) who received TTE and 3D modified REACT (ECG- and respiratory-triggering, Compressed SENSE factor 9 for acceleration of image acquisition) of the thoracic aorta. Aortic diameters (sinus of Valsalva (SV), sinotubular junction (STJ), and ascending aorta (AoA)) were independently measured by two cardiologists in TTE (leading-edge) and two radiologists in modified REACT (inner-edge, using multiplanar reconstruction). Intraclass correlation coefficient, Bland-Altman analyses, and Pearson's correlation (r) were used to assess agreement between observers and methods. RESULTS: Interobserver correlation at the SV, STJ, and AoA were excellent for both, TTE (ICC = 0.95-0.98) and modified REACT (ICC = 0.99-1.00). There was no significant difference between TTE and modified REACT for diameters measured at the SV (39.24 +- 3.24 mm vs. 39.63 +- 3.76 mm; p = 0.26; r = 0.78) and the STJ (35.16 +- 4.47 mm vs. 35.37 +- 4.74 mm; p = 0.552; r = 0.87). AoA diameters determined by TTE were larger than in modified REACT (34.29 +- 5.31 mm vs. 30.65 +- 5.64 mm; p < 0.01; r = 0.74). The mean scan time of modified REACT was 05:06 min +- 02:47 min, depending on the patient's breathing frequency and heart rate. CONCLUSIONS: Both TTE and modified REACT showed a strong correlation for all aortic levels; however, at the AoA, diameters were larger using TTE, mostly due to the limited field of view of the latter with measurements being closer to the aortic valve. Given the excellent interobserver correlation and the strong agreement with TTE, modified REACT represents an attractive method to depict the thoracic aorta in MFS patients.
37866646		Outcomes After Extent I Thoracoabdominal Aortic Repair: Focus on Heritable Aortic Disease.BACKGROUND: Crawford extent I thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) repairs are increasingly performed by an endovascular approach, including in patients with heritable thoracic aortic disease (HTAD). We evaluated outcomes after open extent I TAAA repair in patients with and without HTAD. METHODS: This retrospective study included 992 patients (median age 67 y [57-73]) who underwent extent I TAAA (1990-2022), stratified by the presence of HTAD (n=177, 17.8%). Patients with HTAD had either genetic aortopathies or presented at age <=50 years; 35% (62/177) had Marfan syndrome. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of operative mortality and adverse event (ie, operative death or persistent [present at discharge] stroke, paraplegia, paraparesis, or renal failure necessitating dialysis). Long-term outcomes were analyzed with competing risks analysis. RESULTS: Patients with HTAD had lower operative mortality (1.7% vs 7.0%, P=.01) and adverse event rates (2.8% vs 12.3%, P<.001) than non-HTAD patients. Most HTAD patients were discharged home (92.6% vs 76.9%, P<.001). Predictors of operative mortality were increasing age, aortic dissection, tobacco use, chronic symptoms, and rupture; predictors for adverse events were increasing age, acute symptoms, chronic dissection, and rupture. Patients with HTAD had substantially better repair-failure-free survival (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Open extent I TAAA repair was effective in patients with HTAD, with low operative mortality and adverse event rates, better late survival, and excellent long-term durability, making a compelling argument for preferring open repair in these patients.

However, a significant number of individuals with MFS remain genetically unexplained. In this study, we report novel pathogenic intronic variants in FBN1 in two unrelated families with MFS. METHODS: We evaluated subjects with suspected MFS from two unrelated families using Sanger sequencing or multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification of FBN1 and/or panel-based next-generation sequencing. As no pathogenic variants were identified, whole-genome sequencing was performed. Identified variants were analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR and targeted sequencing of FBN1 mRNA harvested from peripheral blood or skin fibroblasts obtained from affected probands. RESULTS: We found causative deep intronic variants, c.6163+1484A>T and c.5788+36C>A, in FBN1. The splicing analysis revealed an insertion of in-frame or out-of-frame intronic sequences of the FBN1 transcript predicted to alter function of calcium-binding epidermal growth factor protein domain. Family members carrying c.6163+1484A>T had high systemic scores including prominent skeletal features and aortic dissection with lesser aortic dilatation. Family members carrying c.5788+36C>A had more severe aortic root dilatation without aortic dissection. Both families had ectopia lentis. CONCLUSION: Variable penetrance of the phenotype and negative genetic testing in MFS families should raise the possibility of deep intronic FBN1 variants and the need for additional molecular studies. This study expands the mutation spectrum of FBN1 and points out the importance of intronic sequence analysis and the need for integrative functional studies in MFS diagnosis.
36745849		Predicting axial length in patients with Marfan syndrome and ectopia lentis after modified capsular tension ring and intraocular lens implantation.PURPOSE: To predict the growth of axial length (AL) in patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS) and ectopia lentis (EL). SETTING: Eye and ENT Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China. DESIGN: Consecutive retrospective case series. METHODS: Eyes were evaluated that had modified capsular tension ring and intraocular lens implantation. The rate of axial length growth (RALG) was calculated using AL divided by log10-transformed age. A multivariable linear regression model of RALG was developed after validation. RESULTS: A total of 128 patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS) and EL were enrolled with a median follow-up duration of about three years. RALG was independent of age between 3 to 15 years old ( P = 0.799) and decreased to zero thereafter ( P = 0.878). Preoperative AL was associated with RALG in patients under 15 years old ( P = 0.003). Beta values for the final model of RALG were as below: intercept (-9.794) and pre-operative AL (0.664). The postoperative AL was predicted as: postAL = preAL + RALG x log 10 ((postAge + 0.6) / (preAge + 0.6)). The mean prediction error was -0.003 (95%CI, -0.386, 0.3791) mm and the mean absolute percentage error was 1.93% (95%CI, 0.73%, 3.14%). A Python-based calculator was developed to use the predicted AL in selecting IOL power and setting undercorrection. CONCLUSIONS: The AL growth of patients with MFS followed a logarithmic pattern and ceased at about age 15. A prediction model of postoperative AL was established for individual MFS patients between 3-15 years old, which could potentially optimize the IOL power selection.
36948371		Morphometric assessment of the ciliary body in patients with Marfan syndrome and ectopia lentis: A quantitative study using ultrasound biomicroscopy: Ciliary body morphology in Marfan syndrome and ectopia lentis.PURPOSE: To explore the biometric characteristics of the ciliary body in patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS) and ectopia lentis (EL). DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: Seventy-two consecutive MFS patients with EL and 72 non-disease controls were recruited. Ciliary body biometric parameters such as ciliary muscle cross-sectional area at 2000 mum from the scleral spur (CMA2000), ciliary muscle thickness at 1000 mum from the scleral spur (CMT1000), and maximum ciliary body thickness (CBTmax) were measured from multiple directions with ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM). The relationship between ciliary body parameters and other ocular characteristics was also evaluated. RESULTS: Average CMA2000, CMT1000, and CBTmax were 0.692 +- 0.015 mm2, 0.405 +- 0.010 mm, and 0.855+-0.023 mm in MFS eyes, respectively, and were significantly smaller than controls (all p < 0.001). The prevalence of ciliary body thinning was 22.2% in the MFS group versus 0 in controls (p < 0.001); eyes with more severe EL had smaller CMA2000 (p = 0.050), thinner CMT1000 (p = 0.022) and shorter CBTmax (p = 0.015). Patients with microspherophakia (MSP) had even smaller CMA2000 (p = 0.033) and CMT1000 (p = 0.044) than those without MSP. The most common subluxation direction was in the superonasal quadrant (25, 39.7%), which probably correlates with the thinnest CMT1000 in the inferotemporal quadrant (p = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: MFS patients with EL had thinner ciliary muscles, shorter ciliary processes, and a higher prevalence of ciliary body thinning, especially those with MSP. Both the extent and direction of subluxation were associated with ciliary body biometry.
37241174		Marfan Syndrome beyond Aortic Root-Phenotyping Using Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Clinical Implications.Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an inherited autosomal-dominant connective tissue disorder with multiorgan involvement including musculoskeletal, respiratory, cardiovascular, ocular, and skin manifestations. Life expectancy in patients with MFS is primarily determined by the degree of cardiovascular involvement. Aortic disease is the major cardiovascular manifestation of MFS. However, non-aortic cardiac diseases, such as impaired myocardial function and arrhythmia, have been increasingly acknowledged as additional causes of morbidity and mortality. We present two cases demonstrating the phenotypical variation in patients with MFS and how CMR (Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance) could serve as a "one stop shop" to retrieveS all the necessary information regarding aortic/vascular pathology as well as any potential underlying arrhythmogenic substrate or cardiomyopathic process.
36565741	associate|@CHEMICAL_Nitric_Oxide|@DISEASE_Vascular_Diseases ;treat|@CHEMICAL_Telmisartan|@DISEASE_Marfan_Syndrome	Heterogenous improvements in endothelial function by sub-blood pressure lowering doses of ARBs result in major anti-aortic root remodeling effects.Low basal nitric oxide (NO) production is associated with a dysfunctional endothelium and vascular diseases. We have shown that some angiotensin II (AngII) receptor type 1 (AT1R) blockers (ARBs), a group of clinic-approved blood pressure (BP)-lowering medications, are also capable of activating endothelial function acutely and chronically, both ex vivo and in vivo, in pleiotropic, AngII-independent fashions, which suggested that endothelial function enhancement with ARBs may be independent of their well-documented BP lowering properties. Herein, we attempt to identify the most potent ARB at activating endothelial function when administered at sub-BP-lowering doses and determine its anti-aortic root remodeling properties in a model of Marfan syndrome (MFS). Amongst the 8 clinically available ARBs tested, only telmisartan and azilsartan induced significant (70% and 49%, respectively) NO-dependent inhibition of aortic contractility when administered for 4 weeks at sub-BP lowering, EC5 doses. Low-dose telmisartan (0.47 mg/kg) attenuated MFS-associated aortic root widening, medial thickening, and elastic fiber fragmentation to the same degree as high-dose telmisartan (10 mg/kg) despite wide differences in BP lowering between the two doses. Our study suggests that telmisartan is the most potent ARB at promoting increased endothelial function at low sub-BP doses and that it retained major aortic root widening inhibition activities. ARBs may enhance endothelial function independently from BP-lowering pathways, which could lead to new therapeutic approaches.

Previous research found that pathogenic variants clustered in exons 24-32 of fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene result in more severe clinical phenotypes. Furthermore, genotype-phenotype correlation studies suggested that more severe cardiovascular phenotypes were related to variants held responsible for haploinsufficiency. Our objective was to analyze the differences in clinical manifestations and genotypes of individuals with early-onset Marfan syndrome and to assess their impact on management strategies. METHODS: We analyzed clinical and genetic data of a new patient with early-onset Marfan syndrome together with 51 previously reported ones in the PubMed database between 1991 and 2022. RESULTS: Analysis showed 94% (49/52) of pathogenic variants clustered in exons 24-32 of the FBN1. The most common skeletal features were arachnodactyly (98%), reduced elbow extension (48%), pectus deformity (40%), and scoliosis (39%). Haploinsufficiency variants were reported as having poor outcome in 87.5% of the cases. Among patients carrying variants that substitute a cysteine for another amino acid and those that do not change cysteine content, cardiac intervention was found to be associated with a better outcome (p = 0.035 vs. p = 0.002). Variants that create an extra cysteine residue were found to be associated with a higher risk of ectopia lentis. Additionally, children up to 36-months-old were more often reported as still alive at the time of publication compared to newborns (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings have implications for prognosis, because different genotype groups and their resulting phenotype may require personalized care and management.
35318224		Ocular morbidity in Marfan syndrome: a nationwide epidemiological study.BACKGROUND: Ophthalmic complications are profound in Marfan syndrome (MFS). However, the overall burden is not well described. Our purpose was to evaluate the ocular morbidity in a nationwide perspective. METHODS: We identified the ocular morbidity in patients with MFS (n=407) by use of Danish national healthcare registers, using number and timing of hospital contacts related to ophthalmic diagnoses, to ophthalmic surgery and to prescriptions for ophthalmic medication. An age-matched and gender-matched background population (n=40 700) was used as comparator. RESULTS: Among MFS, 56% (226/407) of the patients had at least one registration of an ophthalmic diagnosis as inpatient or outpatient during the study period (HR of 8.0 (95% CI 7.0 to 9.2)). Seven out of 11 main groups of diagnoses were affected, including 'Lens', 'Choroid and retina', 'Ocular muscles, binocular movement, accommodation and refraction', 'Glaucoma', Visual disturbances and blindness', 'Vitreous body and globe', and 'Sclera, cornea, iris and ciliary body'. The number of surgical procedures as well as the use of ophthalmic medication in patients with MFS was significantly increased. CONCLUSION: This nationwide epidemiological study of ocular morbidity in MFS demonstrates a profound burden and emphasises the need for thorough and experienced ophthalmological surveillance.
35305695		The impact of age in acute type A aortic dissection: a retrospective study.BACKGROUND: Acute type A aortic dissection (aTAAD) is a lethal disease and age is an important risk factor for outcomes. This retrospective study was to analyze the impact of age stratification in aTAAD, and to provide clues for surgeons when they make choices of therapy strategies. METHODS: From January 2011 to December 2019, 1092 aTAAD patients from Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital received surgical therapy. Patients were divided into 7 groups according to every ten-year interval (20-80 s). The differences between the groups were analyzed in terms of the baseline preoperative conditions, surgical methods and postoperative outcomes of patients of different age groups. During a median follow-up term of 17 months, the survival rates were compared among 7 groups through Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS: The median age was 52.0 years old in whole cohort. The multiple comorbidities were more common in old age groups (60 s, 70 s, 80 s), while the 20 s group patients had the highest proportion of Marfan syndrome (28.1%). Preoperative hypotension was highest in 80 s (16.7%, P = 0.038). Young age groups (20-60 s) had a higher rate of root replacement and total arch replacement, which led to a longer duration of operation and hypothermic circulation arrest. The overall mortality was 14.1%, the tendency of mortality was increased with age except 20 s group (33.3% in 80 s, P = 0.016). The postoperative morbidity of gastrointestinal bleeding and bowel ischemia were 16.7% and 11.1% in 80 s group. CONCLUSIONS: Age is a major impact factor for aTAAD surgery. Old patients presented more comorbidities before surgery, the mortality and complications rate were significantly higher even with less invasive and conservative surgical therapy. But the favorable long-term survival indicated that the simple or less extensive arch repair is the preferred surgery for patients over 70 years old.
36556976		Combined Bentall and Modified Ravitch Procedures: A Case Report and Systematic Review of the Evidence.Background and Objectives: Marfan syndrome (MS) is a genetic disorder with autosomal dominant inheritance that affects the connective tissue and consequently many organ systems. The cardiovascular manifestations of MS are notorious and include aortic root dilatation or acute aortic dissection, which can cause morbidity and early mortality. However, surgical treatment of aortic pathology may be complicated by musculoskeletal deformity of the chest wall, as in pectus excavatum. In this regard, single-stage combined Bentall and Ravitch surgery is an extreme rarity that has also been scarcely reported in the literature. Patients and Methods: We present the medical history and single-stage Bentall and modified Ravitch surgical treatment of an 18-year-old male MS patient with symptomatic and severe pectus excavatum (PEX) in conjunction with a pear-shaped aortic root aneurysm. To discuss our case in the context of a synopsis of similar published cases, we present a systematic review of combined Bentall surgical aortic aneurysm repair and Ravitch correction of PEX. Results: A total of four studies (one case series and three case reports) and a case from our institution describing a single-stage combined Bentall and Ravitch operation were included. Patients were 22 +- 5.9 years of age (median = 22.5 years) and predominantly male (60%). All cases reported a midline vertical skin incision over the sternum. The most common surgical approach was midsternotomy (80%). In all cases metal struts were used to reinforce the corrected chest wall. Postoperative mortality was zero. Conclusions: Single-stage combined Bentall and Ravitch surgery is an underutilized surgical approach. Its use in MS patients with concomitant PEX and ascending aortic aneurysm that require surgical treatment warrants further investigation. Midsternotomy seems to be a viable access route that provides sufficient exposure in the single-stage surgical setting. Although operative time is long, the intraoperative and postoperative risks appear to be low and manageable.
36099351		Genetic of thoracic aorta aneurysmThe thoracic aortic aneurysm corresponds to the dilation of the ascending part of the aorta, which can lead to a dissection (TAAD for Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm and Dissection) or aortic rupture. The etiologies are diverse, but in approximately 20% of cases a genetic origin is found. About thirty genes are reported to be responsible for the development of TAAD. The majority of these genes encode for proteins involved in the extracellular matrix, the contraction of smooth muscle cells or the growth factor TGF-beta signaling pathway. Identifying the pathogenic variant responsible for the aortic disease becomes essential to make a definitive diagnosis, to guide and to personalize the treatment of the patients but also to screen relatives at risk. The availability and access to genetic testing have improved considerably with the development of new sequencing techniques (NGS for Next Generation Sequencing) and the use of gene panels. This review summarizes the main genes associated with TAAD as well as the current diagnostic strategy.
36055553		Midterm outcomes of isolated thoracic aortic replacement in congenital versus degenerative aortopathy in a 15-year institutional cohort.BACKGROUND: Open aortic replacement represents the only approved option to address thoracic aortopathy among patients with connective tissue disorders (CTD). The aim of our study was to investigate contemporary midterm outcomes of isolated thoracic aortic replacement in patients with CTD versus degenerative pathology in a large institutional cohort. METHODS: All patients undergoing isolated open thoracic aortic replacement at a single academic center from 2005 to 2020 were included. Patients were classified as having CTD or not having CTD based on documented genetic mutations associated with congenital aortopathy. In-hospital and midterm outcomes, including mortality, paraplegia, development of new arterial pathology on surveillance imaging, and the need for future operations, were compared between groups using descriptive statistics and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. RESULTS: Overall, 62 patients were included with a median follow-up of 58 months (range, 19-81 months) (59 months for those with CTD vs 51.5 months for those without CTD). CTD was present in 18 patients (29%), with 16 having Marfan syndrome (77.8%). Patients with CTD were younger than patients without CTD (45.8 years vs 60.9 years) and had lower rates of smoking (5.6% vs 56.8%) and hypertension (97.7% vs 72.2%; all P < .01). Patients with CTD were more likely to have a dissection component at the time of repair compared with patients without CTD (100% vs 59.1%) and underwent repair at smaller aortic diameters (5.9 cm vs 6.6 cm; both P < .05). There were no differences in in-hospital outcomes between the two groups, including mortality (4.5% vs 5.6%) and paraplegia (2.3% vs 0%; both P > .05). At 5 years, patients with CTD were more likely to have developed aneurysmal changes distal to their thoracic repair (88.9% vs 47.7%) and extra-aortic arterial aneurysms (41.2% vs 2.3%; both P < .05). However, on survival analysis, there were no differences in freedom from additional vascular procedures (hazard ratio,1.76; P = .333) or, specifically, additional aortic procedures (hazard ratio, 1.81; P = .380) between the two groups. There was only one anastomotic complication identified on longitudinal follow-up, which occurred in a patient without CTD 8 years after the index operation. CONCLUSIONS: Although carrying significant operative risks and the potential for morbidity, open thoracic aortic replacement represents a well-tolerated, durable treatment option for patients with congenitally mediated thoracic aortic disease. Because both patients with and without CTD who required thoracic aortic replacement often need future aortic intervention, vigilant surveillance is warranted. Equivalent intervention rates between the two groups suggest remodeling of the CTD aorta is almost universally characterized by initial postrepair dilation, but the majority of these changes successfully stabilize and do not progress to higher rates of intervention.
37046157		Extended law of laplace for measurement of the cloverleaf anatomy of the aortic root.The cross-sectional shape of the aortic root is cloverleaf, not circular, raising controversy regarding how best to measure its radiographic "diameter" for aortic event prediction. We mathematically extended the law of Laplace to estimate aortic wall stress within this cloverleaf region, simultaneously identifying a new metric of aortic root dimension that can be applied to clinical measurement of the aortic root and sinuses of Valsalva on clinical computerized tomographic scans. Enforcing equilibrium between blood pressure and wall stress, finite element computations were performed to evaluate the mathematical derivation. The resulting Laplace diameter was compared with existing methods of aortic root measurement across four patient groups: non-syndromic aneurysm, bicuspid aortic valve, Marfan syndrome, and non-dilated root patients (total 106 patients, 62 M, 44 F). (1) Wall stress: Mean wall stress at the depth of the sinuses followed this equation: Wall stress = BP x Circumscribing circle diameter/(2 x Aortic wall thickness). Therefore, the diameter of the circle enclosing the root cloverleaf, that is, twice the distance between the center, where the sinus-to-commissure lines coincide, and the depth of the sinuses, may replace diameter in the Laplace relation for a cloverleaf cross-section (or any shaped cross-section with two or more planes of symmetry). This mathematically derived result was verified by computational finite element analyses. (2) Diameters: CT scan measurements showed a significant difference between this new metric, the Laplace diameter, and the sinus-to-commissure, mid-sinus-to-mid-sinus, and coronal measurements in all four groups (p-value < 0.05). The average Laplace diameter measurements differed significantly from the other measurements in all patient groups. Among the various possible measurements within the aortic root, the diameter of the circumscribing circle, enclosing the cloverleaf, represents the diameter most closely related to wall stress. This diameter is larger than the other measurements, indicating an underestimation of wall stress by prior measurements, and otherwise provides an unbiased, convenient, consistent, physics-based measurement for clinical use. "Diameter" applies to circles. Our mathematical derivation of an extension of the law of Laplace, from circular to cloverleaf cross-sectional geometries of the aortic root, has implications for measurement of aortic root "diameter." The suggested method is as follows: (1) the "center" of the aortic root is identified by drawing three sinus-to-commissure lines. The intersection of these three lines identifies the "center" of the cloverleaf. (2) The largest radius from this center point to any of the sinuses is identified as the "radius" of the aortic root. (3) This radius is doubled to give the "diameter" of the aortic root. We find that this diameter best corresponds to maximal wall stress in the aortic root. Please note that this diameter defines the smallest circle that completely encloses the cloverleaf shape, touching the depths of all three sinuses.
36722594		Difficult ventilation in a patient with a giant aortic aneurysm: A challenge for the anesthesiologist.Patients with Marfan syndrome present anatomic variations that may increase the risk of a difficult airway. Moreover, they can present large aortic aneurysms, which may cause extrinsic airway compression. Therefore, difficult ventilation during general anesthesia poses a challenge in that the anesthesiologist has to promptly make a crucial differential diagnosis. Multidisciplinary preoperative assessment and planning of the airway and ventilation management are of utmost importance in such uncommon and highly complex clinical cases. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy is probably a really useful tool in order to assess the severity and extent of the airway compression, both preoperatively and intraoperatively. We present a clinical case where difficult ventilation occurred immediately after the induction of general anesthesia.
37314760		Outcomes After Endovascular Aortic Intervention in Patients With Connective Tissue Disease.Importance: Endovascular treatment is not recommended for aortic pathologies in patients with connective tissue diseases (CTDs) other than in redo operations and as bridging procedures in emergencies. However, recent developments in endovascular technology may challenge this dogma. Objective: To assess the midterm outcomes of endovascular aortic repair in patients with CTD. Design, Setting, and Participants: For this descriptive retrospective study, data on demographics, interventions, and short-term and midterm outcomes were collected from 18 aortic centers in Europe, Asia, North America, and New Zealand. Patients with CTD who had undergone endovascular aortic repair from 2005 to 2020 were included. Data were analyzed from December 2021 to November 2022. Exposure: All principal endovascular aortic repairs, including redo surgery and complex repairs of the aortic arch and visceral aorta. Main Outcomes and Measures: Short-term and midterm survival, rates of secondary procedures, and conversion to open repair. Results: In total, 171 patients were included: 142 with Marfan syndrome, 17 with Loeys-Dietz syndrome, and 12 with vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS). Median (IQR) age was 49.9 years (37.9-59.0), and 107 patients (62.6%) were male. One hundred fifty-two (88.9%) were treated for aortic dissections and 19 (11.1%) for degenerative aneurysms. One hundred thirty-six patients (79.5%) had undergone open aortic surgery before the index endovascular repair. In 74 patients (43.3%), arch and/or visceral branches were included in the repair. Primary technical success was achieved in 168 patients (98.2%), and 30-day mortality was 2.9% (5 patients). Survival at 1 and 5 years was 96.2% and 80.6% for Marfan syndrome, 93.8% and 85.2% for Loeys-Dietz syndrome, and 75.0% and 43.8% for vEDS, respectively. After a median (IQR) follow-up of 4.7 years (1.9-9.2), 91 patients (53.2%) had undergone secondary procedures, of which 14 (8.2%) were open conversions. Conclusions and Relevance: This study found that endovascular aortic interventions, including redo procedures and complex repairs of the aortic arch and visceral aorta, in patients with CTD had a high rate of early technical success, low perioperative mortality, and a midterm survival rate comparable with reports of open aortic surgery in patients with CTD. The rate of secondary procedures was high, but few patients required conversion to open repair. Improvements in devices and techniques, as well as ongoing follow-up, may result in endovascular treatment for patients with CTD being included in guideline recommendations.

36097197		Discrepancy of echocardiography and computed tomography in initial assessment and 2-year follow-up for monitoring Marfan syndrome and related disorders.Patients with Marfan syndrome and related disorders are at risk for aortic dissection and aortic rupture and therefore require appropriate monitoring. Computed tomography (CT) and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) are routinely used for initial diagnosis and follow-up. The purpose of this study is to compare whole-heart CT and TTE aortic measurement for initial work-up, 2-year follow-up, and detection of progressive aortic enlargement. This retrospective study included 95 patients diagnosed with Marfan syndrome or a related disorder. All patients underwent initial work-up including aortic diameter measurement using both electrocardiography-triggered whole-heart CT and TTE. Forty-two of these patients did not undergo aortic repair after initial work-up and were monitored by follow-up imaging within 2 years. Differences between the two methods for measuring aortic diameters were compared using Bland-Altman plots. The acceptable clinical limit of agreement (acLOA) for initial work-up, follow-up, and progression within 2 years was predefined as <  +- 2 mm. Bland-Altman analysis revealed a small bias of 0.2 mm with wide limits of agreement (LOA) from + 6.3 to - 5.9 mm for the aortic sinus and a relevant bias of - 1.6 mm with wide LOA from + 5.6 to - 8.9 mm for the ascending aorta. Follow-up imaging yielded a small bias of 0.5 mm with a wide LOA from + 6.7 to - 5.8 mm for the aortic sinus and a relevant bias of 1.1 mm with wide LOA from + 8.1 to - 10.2 mm for the ascending aorta. Progressive aortic enlargement at follow-up was detected in 57% of patients using CT and 40% of patients using TTE. Measurement differences outside the acLOA were most frequently observed for the ascending aorta. Whole-heart CT and TTE measurements show good correlation, but the frequency of measurement differences outside the acLOA is high. TTE systematically overestimates aortic diameters. Therefore, whole-heart CT may be preferred for aortic monitoring of patients with Marfan syndrome and related disorders. TTE remains an indispensable imaging tool that provides additional information not available with CT.

38363416		Longitudinal changes of refractive error in preschool children with congenital ectopia lentis.BACKGROUND: Congenital ectopia lentis (CEL) is a hereditary eye disease which severely impacts preschool children's visual function and development. This study aimed to evaluate the longitudinal changes in spherical equivalent (SE) refractive error in preschool children with CEL. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted at Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Guangzhou, China. Medical records of CEL patients under 6-year-old who were diagnosed with Marfan syndrome at the initial visit from January 2014 to March 2022 were collected and were divided into surgery and non-surgery groups. Mean change rate of SE in the two groups was evaluated, and the potential associated factors of SE change rate were investigated by mixed-effect regression model. RESULTS: A total of 94 preschool patients from 14 provinces of China were included. Among the 42 children of the surgery group, the mean age with standard deviation (SD) was 5.02 +- 0.81 years and patients experienced a myopic shift of -0.05 +- 0.09 D/month in average. The mean age with SD of the 52 children of the non-surgery group was 4.34 +- 1.02 years, and the mean myopic shift was -0.09 +- 0.14 D/month. The mixed-effect regression model identified that higher degree of myopia at baseline was associated with slower myopic shift both in surgery (beta = 0.901, 95% CI: 0.822 ~ 0.980, P < 0.001) and in non-surgery group (beta = 1.006, 95% CI: 0.977 ~ 1.034, P < 0.001) in CEL patients. Surgical treatment (beta = 2.635, 95% CI: 1.376 ~ 3.894, P < 0.001) was associated with slower myopic shift in all participants CEL patients. CONCLUSIONS: Myopic progression was slower in the surgery group than in the non-surgery group of CEL. Preschool CEL patients who met the surgical indication are suggested being performed with timely surgery to slow down the myopic progression.

37160424		Longitudinal follow-up by MR angiography reveals progressive dilatation of the distal aorta after aortic root replacement in Marfan syndrome.OBJECTIVES: To define and compare growth rates of the distal aorta in Marfan patients with and without aortic root replacement using serial MR angiography (MRA). METHODS: We retrospectively included 136 Marfan patients with a total of 645 MRAs who underwent a median of five MRAs (range: 2-13) at 1.5 T and 3 T in annual intervals. Of these, 41 patients (34.8 +- 12 years) had undergone aortic root replacement. The remaining 95 patients (29.0 +- 17 years) still had a native aorta and served as the control group. Thoracic aortic diameters were independently measured at eleven predefined levels. Estimated growth rates were calculated using a mixed effects model adjusted for sex, age, BMI, and medication. RESULTS: Marfan patients with aortic root replacement revealed the highest mean estimated growth rate in the proximal descending aorta (0.77 mm/year, CI: 0.31-1.21). Mean growth rates at all levels of the distal thoracic aorta were significantly higher in patients with aortic root replacement (0.28-0.77 mm/year) when compared to patients without aortic root replacement (0.03-0.07 mm/year) (all p < 0.001). Antihypertensive medication, gender, and BMI had no significant impact on the distal aortic growth rates. CONCLUSION: Distal thoracic aortic diameters increase at a significantly higher rate in Marfan patients with aortic root replacement compared to Marfan patients without aortic root replacement. Further studies are warranted to investigate if the increased growth rate of the distal thoracic aorta after aortic root replacement is caused by altered hemodynamics due to the rigid aortic root graft or due to the general genetic disposition of post-operative Marfan patients. CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: High growth rates of the distal aorta after aortic root replacement underline the need for careful life-long aortic imaging of Marfan patients after aortic root replacement. KEY POINTS:   Aortic growth rates in Marfan patients with aortic root replacement are highest in the mid-aortic arch, the proximal- and mid-descending aorta.   Growth rates of the distal thoracic aorta are significantly higher in Marfan patients with aortic root replacement compared to Marfan patients without aortic root replacement.   Antihypertensive medication, gender, and BMI have no significant impact on distal aortic growth rates in Marfan patients.

Methods: To determine the etiological role of de novo mutations (DNMs) and genetic profile in IEDs, we retrospectively reviewed a large cohort of proband-parent trios of Chinese origin. The patients underwent a detailed examination and was clinically diagnosed by an ophthalmologist. Panel-based targeted exome sequencing was performed on DNA extracted from blood samples, containing coding regions of 792 IED-causative genes and their flanking exons. All participants underwent genetic testing. Results: All proband-parent trios were divided into 22 subgroups, the overall diagnostic yield was 48.67% (605/1243), ranging from 4% to 94.44% for each of the subgroups. A total of 108 IED-causative genes were identified, with the top 24 genes explaining 67% of the 605 genetically solved trios. The genetic etiology of 6.76% (84/1243) of the trio was attributed to disease-causative DNMs, and the top 3 subgroups with the highest incidence of DNM were aniridia (n = 40%), Marfan syndrome/ectopia lentis (n = 38.78%), and retinoblastoma (n = 37.04%). The top 10 genes have a diagnostic yield of DNM greater than 3.5% in their subgroups, including PAX6 (40.00%), FBN1 (38.78%), RB1 (37.04%), CRX (10.34%), CHM (9.09%), WFS1 (8.00%), RP1L1 (5.88%), RS1 (5.26%), PCDH15 (4.00%), and ABCA4 (3.51%). Additionally, the incidence of DNM in offspring showed a trend of correlation with paternal age at reproduction, but not statistically significant with paternal (P = 0.154) and maternal (P = 0.959) age at reproduction. Conclusions: Trios-based genetic analysis has high accuracy and validity. Our study helps to quantify the burden of the full spectrum IED caused by each gene, offers novel potential for elucidating etiology, and plays a crucial role in genetic counseling and patient management.
37758246		Early and Long-Term Outcomes of Young Adult Patients <=30 Years Old with Acute Type A Aortic Dissection.OBJECTIVES: To investigate the early and long-term outcomes after total arch replacement and frozen elephant trunk implantation in adult patients <=30 years with acute type A aortic dissection. METHODS: All young adult patients (<=30 years) with acute type A aortic dissection who underwent total arch replacement and frozen elephant trunk between 2009 and 2017 were enrolled. The end-points were major organ morbidity and mortality, aortic-related events, and reoperation. RESULTS: The mean age of all 83 patients was 25.9 (standard deviation, 3.3) years. The in-hospital mortality was 9.64% (8/83), and 9 (10.8%) patients required re-exploration for bleeding. The aortic-related events risk was 42.7% (32/75) and aortic reoperation risk was 17.3% (13/75). Overall survival was 85.5% (95% CI, 75.9%-91.5%) at 5 years and 75.9% (95% CI, 63.3%-84.7%) at 10 years. The cumulative incidence of aortic-related events was 35% (95% CI, 24%-47%) at 5 years and 58% (95% CI, 36%-75%) at 10 years; the cumulative reoperation rate was 15% (95% CI, 7.9%-24%) at 5 years and 17% (95% CI, 9.2%-27%) at 10 years. Marfan syndrome significantly increased the aortic-related events (P = 0.036) and reoperation (P = 0.041) risks. CONCLUSIONS: Despite extensive repair in young acute type A aortic dissection patients, the late aortic dilatation and reoperation risk remain high. The total arch replacement and frozen elephant trunk procedure achieved satisfactory early outcomes and reduced late aortic dilatation and reoperation in young patients compared with other records. Close follow-up and aggressive early reintervention are essential for patients with aortic-related risk factors early in life.
37913934		Clinical application of four-dimensional flow cardiovascular magnetic resonance in Marfan syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis.This study aims to fill this gap by assessing the application of 4D flow CMR in MFS through a systematic review and meta-analysis. We conducted a comprehensive search of databases from their inception to May 1, 2023. Eligibility criteria were established based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The quality of studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS), with studies scoring above five deemed high quality. Meta-analyses were performed using Stata 15.1 software. Nine studies were analyzed. Findings indicate MFS patients had increased vortex flow in the descending aorta (DAo), larger aortic root diameter (ARD) and Z-scores, lower inner wall shear stress (WSS) in the proximal descending aorta (pDAo), reduced in-plane rotational flow (IRF) in the aortic arch and proximal descending aorta (pDAo), and increased pulse wave velocity (PWV) in the ascending aorta (AAo) and DAo compared to healthy subjects. No significant difference in systolic flow reversal ratio was observed. Sensitivity analysis showed no heterogeneity and Egger's test revealed no publication bias. This meta-analysis underscores the effectiveness of 4D flow CMR in detecting MFS, particularly through indicators such as vortex flow, WSS, IRF, ARD, and PWV. The findings provide insights into diagnosing cardiovascular diseases and predicting cardiovascular events in MFS patients. Further case-control studies are needed to establish measurement standards and explore potential indicators for improved diagnosis and treatment of MFS.
35841950		Improved Outcomes of Reimplantation vs Remodeling in Marfan Syndrome: A Propensity-Matched Study.BACKGROUND: Valve-sparing root replacement (VSRR) has excellent outcomes when performed in experienced centers in well-selected patients. It is suggested that reimplantation of the aortic valve may have better durability than remodeling in patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS), although long-term comparative data are limited. METHODS: Between 1988 and 2018, 194 patients with MFS underwent VSRR at our institution. From these, we derived a propensity-matched cohort of 68 patients (44 who underwent reimplantation and 24 who had remodeling). Early outcomes included death and perioperative complications. Late outcomes were survival, probability of aortic insufficiency, and reintervention up to 20 years of follow-up. Median follow-up was 17.8 years (interquartile range, 12.0-20.6 years) for the entire matched cohort. RESULTS: Baseline variables were similar between reimplantation and remodeling patients after matching: age (39 +- 12 vs 40 +- 13 years, P = .75) and male sex (28 [64%] vs 15 [63%], P = 1.0). Similar 20-year survival was observed after reimplantation compared with remodeling (82% vs 72%, P = .20), whereas the probability of developing greater than mild aortic insufficiency at 20 years was increased after remodeling (5.8% vs 13%, P = .013). More patients underwent reoperation on the aortic valve after a remodeling procedure than after reimplantation of the aortic valve (18% vs 0%, P = .018). CONCLUSIONS: VSRR provides excellent long-term survival and freedom from valve-related complications outcomes in patients with MFS. Reimplantation of the aortic valve was associated with a lower risk of aortic valve reoperation and aortic insufficiency than the remodeling procedure after 2 decades of follow-up.

Notch signaling is essential for vessel morphogenesis and function. However, the role of Notch signaling in aortic pathology and aortic smooth muscle cell (SMC) differentiation in Marfan syndrome (MFS) is not completely understood. METHODS: RNA-sequencing on ascending aortic tissue from a mouse model of MFS, Fbn1mgR/mgR , and wild-type controls was performed. Notch 3 expression and activation in aortic tissue were confirmed with real-time RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, and Western blot. Fbn1mgR/mgR and wild-type mice were treated with a gamma-secretase inhibitor, DAPT, to block Notch activation. Aortic aneurysms and rupture were evaluated with connective tissue staining, ultrasound, and life table analysis. RESULTS: The murine RNA-sequencing data were validated with mouse and human MFS aortic tissue, demonstrating elevated Notch3 activation in MFS. Data further revealed that upregulation and activation of Notch3 were concomitant with increased expression of SMC contractile markers. Inhibiting Notch3 activation with DAPT attenuated aortic enlargement and improved survival of Fbn1mgR/mgR mice. DAPT treatment reduced elastin fiber fragmentation in the aorta and reversed the differentiation of SMCs. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrated that matrix abnormalities in the aorta of MFS are associated with increased Notch3 activation. Enhanced Notch3 activation in MFS contributed to aortic aneurysm formation in MFS. This might be mediated by inducing a contractile phenotypic change of SMC. Our results suggest that inhibiting Notch3 activation may provide a strategy to prevent and treat aortic aneurysms in MFS.
38296295		Protocol for an evaluation of the initiation of an integrated longitudinal outpatient care model for severe chronic non-communicable diseases (PEN-Plus) at secondary care facilities (district hospitals) in 10 lower-income countries.INTRODUCTION: The Package of Essential Noncommunicable Disease Interventions-Plus (PEN-Plus) is a strategy decentralising care for severe non-communicable diseases (NCDs) including type 1 diabetes, rheumatic heart disease and sickle cell disease, to increase access to care. In the PEN-Plus model, mid-level clinicians in intermediary facilities in low and lower middle income countries are trained to provide integrated care for conditions where services traditionally were only available at tertiary referral facilities. For the upcoming phase of activities, 18 first-level hospitals in 9 countries and 1 state in India were selected for PEN-Plus expansion and will treat a variety of severe NCDs. Over 3 years, the countries and state are expected to: (1) establish PEN-Plus clinics in one or two district hospitals, (2) support these clinics to mature into training sites in preparation for national or state-level scale-up, and (3) work with the national or state-level stakeholders to describe, measure and advocate for PEN-Plus to support development of a national operational plan for scale-up. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Guided by Proctor outcomes for implementation research, we are conducting a mixed-method evaluation consisting of 10 components to understand outcomes in clinical implementation, training and policy development. Data will be collected through a mix of quantitative surveys, routine reporting, routine clinical data and qualitative interviews. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This protocol has been considered exempt or covered by central and local institutional review boards. Findings will be disseminated throughout the project's course, including through quarterly M&E discussions, semiannual formative assessments, dashboard mapping of progress, quarterly newsletters, regular feedback loops with national stakeholders and publication in peer-reviewed journals.
37096976		Bentall Procedure to Repair Acute Type a Aortic Dissection in Pregnant Marfan Syndrome Woman With Preservation of Pregnancy.Background: Acute aortic dissection is the most common life-threatening disorder classically presenting with tearing chest pain radiating to the back yet can have deceiving clinical presentations.Case presentation: The patient was a 22-year-old pregnant woman (gravida 6, para 4, abortion1) at 26 weeks of gestation. She was a known case of Marfan syndrome who developed acute type A aortic dissection during pregnancy. Repair of aortic dissection was done through the Bentall procedure with a composite mechanical valved conduit while Fetal heart rate (FHR) was simultaneously monitored during surgery. Three months after surgical repair, the newborn was delivered via cesarean, and both mother and baby survived without any complications.Conclusions: In this case, we demonstrated that repair of type A aortic dissection can be done in pregnant women with preservation of fetus in the uterus through close cooperation among all members of a multi-disciplinary team.
36951534		Acute Type A Aortic Dissection in Adolescents and Young Adults under 30 Years of Age: Demographics, Etiology and Postoperative Outcomes of 139 cases.BACKGROUND: The prevalence and etiology of acute aortic dissection type A in patients <=30 years is unknown. The aims of this clinical study were to determine the prevalence and potential etiology of acute aortic dissection type A in surgically treated patients <=30 years and to evaluate the respective postoperative outcomes in this selective group of patients in a large multi-centre study. METHODS: Retrospective data collection was performed at the 16 participating international aortic institutions. All patients <=30years at the time of dissection onset were included. The postoperative results were analysed with regard to connective tissue disease. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of acute aortic dissection type A <= 30years was 1.8% (139 out of 7914 patients), including 51(36.7%) patients who were retrospectively diagnosed with connective tissue disease. Cumulative postoperative mortality was 8.6%, 2.2% and 1.4%, respectively. Actuarial survival was 80% at 10 years postoperatively. Non- connective tissue disease patients (n = 88) had a significantly higher incidence of arterial hypertension (46.6%vs.9.8%;p<0.001) while acute aortic dissection type A affected the aortic root (p < 0.001) and arch (p = 0.029) significantly more often in the connective tissue disease group. A positive family history of aortic disease was present in 9.4% of the study cohort(n = 13). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of acute aortic dissection type A in surgically treated patients <=30 years is less than 2% with connective tissue disease and arterial hypertension as the two most prevalent triggers of acute aortic dissection type A. Open surgery may be performed with good early results and excellent mid- to long-term outcomes.

36239929		Endovascular therapy for Stanford B aortic dissection for patients with Marfan Syndrome: systematic review and meta-analysis.INTRODUCTION: The role of thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) in patients with Marfan Syndrome with Stanford type B aortic dissection (TBAD) remains under debate. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched through December 2021 to identify studies that investigated outcomes in MFS patients with TBAD who underwent TEVAR. Data regarding patient characteristics, perioperative and late outcomes were extracted. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Twelve studies were identified including 120 patients. The mean age was 40.2 years (95% confidence interval [CI], 36.8-43.6). 40.4% (95% CI: 10.8-70.0) of cases were performed emergently. 76.2% (95% CI: 64.6-87.8) of patients had a history of previous aortic surgery. In-hospital mortality was 3.7% (95% CI: 0.6-6.8). Primary endoleak occurred in 15.2% (95% CI: 8.6-21.8), which was comprised of type 1 (9.3% [95% CI: 3.9-14.6]) and type 2 (7.1% [95% CI: 2.3-12.0]) endoleaks. During mean follow-up period of 37.4 months (95% CI: 24.1-50.7), secondary endoleak was reported in 14.1% (95% CI: 7.1-21.1), which was comprised of type 1 (7.4% [95% CI: 2.4-12.5]) and type 2 (4.0% [95% CI: 0.3-7.7]) endoleak. Repeat TEVAR was performed in 15.5% (95% CI: 9.3-21.8) and open aortic surgery in 18.6% (95% CI: 9.6-27.5). Long-term mortality was 11.9% (95% CI: 6.5-17.3). CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis showed that TEVAR for TBAD in patients with MFS has low perioperative morbidity and mortality but was associated with a high rate of late reintervention. This treatment option should be limited to emergent cases and to patients deemed unsuitable for open repair. Lifelong follow-up with imaging is mandatory in this population.

37556572		Case of the False Fracture: A Report of a Radiographic Stitching Error in a Scoliosis Patient.CASE: A 14-year-old boy with Marfan syndrome-associated scoliosis underwent postoperative imaging after scoliosis surgery. The lateral radiograph seemingly depicted a compression fracture of the L4 vertebra, despite the patient being asymptomatic. Further investigation with focused lumbar spine films, however, revealed a normal L4 vertebra. The apparent abnormality was attributed to an error in the image merging process. CONCLUSION: Image stitching errors can lead to a false impression of structural abnormalities. It is crucial for radiology technologists and clinicians to exercise caution when reviewing digitally stitched images. We reiterate the recommendation for technicians to label stitched images and indicate overlapping regions, facilitating judicious and accurate radiographic assessment.
35916717		Outcomes of valve-sparing surgery in heritable aortic disorders: results from the AVIATOR registry.OBJECTIVES: Root reimplantation has been the favoured approach for patients with heritable aortic disorder requiring valve-sparring root replacement. In the past few years, root remodelling with annuloplasty has emerged as an alternative to root reimplantation in the general population. The aim of this study was to examine the late outcomes of patients with heritable aortic disorder undergoing valve-sparring root replacement and compare different techniques. METHODS: Using the AVIATOR registry (Aortic Valve Insufficiency and ascending aorta Aneurysm InternATiOnal Registry), data were collected from 5 North American and European centres. Patients were divided into 4 groups according to the technique of valve-sparing used (root reimplantation, root remodelling with ring annuloplasty, root remodelling with suture annuloplasty and root remodelling alone). The primary endpoints were freedom from aortic regurgitation (AR) >=2 and freedom from reintervention on the aortic valve. Secondary endpoints were survival and changes in annular dimensions over time. RESULTS: A total of 237 patients were included in the study (reimplantation = 100, remodelling + ring annuloplasty = 76, remodelling + suture annuloplasty = 34, remodelling alone = 27). The majority of patients had Marfan syndrome (83%). Preoperative AR >=2 was present in 41% of the patients. Operative mortality was 0.4% (n = 1). No differences were found between techniques in terms of postoperative AR >=2 (P = 0.58), reintervention (P = 0.52) and survival (P = 0.59). Changes in aortic annulus dimension were significantly different at 10 years (P < 0.05), a difference that started to emerge 4 years after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, valve-sparring root replacement is a safe and durable procedure in patients with heritable aortic disorder. Nevertheless, root remodelling alone is associated with late annular dilatation. The addition of an annuloplasty, however, results in similar freedom from AR, reintervention, survival and changes in annulus size compared to reimplantation.
36650042		Matched comparison between external aortic root support and valve-sparing root replacement.OBJECTIVES: Differences in indication and technique make a randomised comparison between valve-sparing root replacement (VSRR) and personalised external aortic root support (PEARS) challenging. We performed a propensity score (PS)-matched comparison of PEARS and VSRR for syndromic root aneurysm. METHODS: Patients in the PEARS 200 Database and Aortic Valve Insufficiency and ascending aorta Aneurysm InternATiOnal Registry (undergoing VSRR) with connective tissue disease operated electively for root aneurysm <60 mm with aortic regurgitation (AR) <1/4 were included. Using a PS analysis, 80 patients in each cohort were matched. Survival, freedom from reintervention and from AR >=2/4 were estimated using a Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 25 and 55 months for 159 PEARS and 142 VSRR patients. Seven (4.4%) patients undergoing PEARS required an intervention for coronary injury or impingement, resulting in one death (0.6%). After VSRR, there were no early deaths, 10 (7%) reinterventions for bleeding and 1 coronary intervention. Survival for matched cohorts at 5 years was similar (PEARS 98% vs VSRR 99%, p=0.99). There was no difference in freedom from valve or ascending aortic/arch reintervention between matched groups. Freedom from AR >=2/4 at 5 years in the matched cohorts was 97% for PEARS vs 92% for VSRR (p=0.55). There were no type A dissections. CONCLUSIONS: VSRR and PEARS offer favourable mid-term survival, freedom from reintervention and preservation of valve function. Both treatments deserve their place in the surgical repertoire, depending on a patient's disease stage. This study is limited by its retrospective nature and different follow-ups in both cohorts.
36272618		Current controversies in aortic valve-preserving surgery.The clinical outcome of severe aortic regurgitation (AR) remains suboptimal, but surgery has been shown to have survival benefit over medical therapy. Postoperative survival is inferior in patients with reduced left ventricular function, and therefore early surgical intervention is recommended. Aortic valvuloplasty (AVP) is an attractive option to avoid the major drawbacks of prosthetic valves but has not been widely adopted. The etiology of AR is classified functionally into three groups: normal leaflet motion (type I), cusp prolapse (type II), and restriction (type III). Type I with dilatation of the sinus of Valsalva (type Ib) can be repaired by aortic valve reimplantation or aortic root remodeling with similar valve stability. Type I with dilatation of the aortic annulus (type Ic) can be managed by annuloplasty. Type II can be corrected by plication or resuspension techniques. Pericardial patch is necessary in AVP for type Id (perforation/fenestration) and type III but is associated with risk of recurrence. Bicuspid aortic valve is classified according to commissure angle: symmetrical, asymmetrical, and very asymmetrical. Tricuspidization is recommended for repair of very asymmetrical valves to avoid postoperative stenosis. Recent progress has achieved similar reoperation rates between bicuspid and tricuspid aortic valve repair. For Marfan syndrome, valve-sparing root replacement is advantageous compared to Bentall operation regarding late survival, thromboembolic and hemorrhagic events, and endocarditis. Similar findings have been reported in acute aortic dissection. Both remodeling and reimplantation procedures provide similar favorable outcomes in these settings. Recent advances in AVP are summarized by quantitative assessment of cusp configuration (effective height and geometric height), graft size decision, use of template to cut the graft, and videoscopic assessment of post-repair cusp configuration. Due to these advances, AVP shows superior results to replacement surgery. Further concrete evidence with larger case volumes and longer observation periods are necessary to popularize AVP.
35883019		Early and midterm results of frozen elephant trunk operation with Evita open stent-graft in patients with Marfan syndrome: results of a multicentre study.BACKGROUND: Endovascular treatment of patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS) is not recommended. Hybrid procedures such as frozen elephant trunk (FET), which combines stent-graft deployment with an integrated non-stented fabric graft for proximal grafting and suturing, have not been previously evaluated. The aim of this study was to assess the safety and feasibility of FET operation in patients with MFS. METHODS: Patients enrolled in the International E-vita Open Registry (IEOR) who underwent FET procedure between January 2001 and February 2020 meeting Ghent criteria for MFS were included in the study. Early and midterm results were retrospectively analyzed. Preoperative, postoperative and follow-up computed tomography angiography scans were analysed. RESULTS: We analyzed 37 patients [mean age 38 +- 11 years, 65% men]. Acute or chronic aortic dissection was present in 35 (95%) patients (14 and 21 patients respectively). Two (5%) patients had an aneurysm without dissection. Malperfusion syndrome was present in 4 patients. Twenty-nine (78%) patients had history of aortic surgical interventions. The 30-day and in-hospital mortality amounted to 8 and 14% respectively. False lumen exclusion was present in 73% in stented segment in last postoperative CT. The overall 5-year survival was 71% and freedom from reintervention downstream was 58% at 5 years. Of the nine patients who required reintervention for distal aortic disease, one patient died. CONCLUSIONS: FET operation for patients with MFS can be performed with acceptable mortality and morbidity. In long-term follow-up no reinterventions on the aortic arch were required. FET allows for easier second stage operations providing platform for surgical and endovascular reinterventions.
37203318		[Intracranial hypotension syndrome in a pediatric patient with Marfan syndrome].Intracranial hypotension syndrome (IHS) is attributed to reduced cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure. It may be spontaneous or secondary to a history of trauma or systemic disease. We present the case of an 11-year-old boy, with medical history of Marfan syndrome, with orthostatic headache and persistent vomiting (12 hours) following a fall on the sacrococcygeal region. Magnetic resonance showed extradural fluid collections at dorsal and lumbosacral levels, compatible with CSF leak. The condition was resolved with treatment, but the patient had two new episodes during the follow-up period. Thus, an epidural blood patch was performed two years after the first episode. Although HIS is uncommon in children, it should be suspected in patients with orthostatic headache, particularly if the patient presents a connectivopathy. Few studies have assessed the management of HIS in paediatric age. The case presented here and the reviewed available literature provides further data for these type of cases.
36460281		HTAD patient pathway: Strategy for diagnostic work-up of patients and families with (suspected) heritable thoracic aortic diseases (HTAD). A statement from the HTAD working group of VASCERN.Heritable thoracic aortic diseases (HTAD) are rare pathologies associated with thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissection, which can be syndromic or non-syndromic. They may result from genetic defects. Associated genes identified to date are classified into those encoding components of the (a) extracellular matrix (b) TGFbeta pathway and (c) smooth muscle contractile mechanism. Timely diagnosis allows for prompt aortic surveillance and prophylactic surgery, hence improving life expectancy and reducing maternal complications as well as providing reassurance to family members when a diagnosis is ruled out. This document is an expert opinion reflecting strategies put forward by medical experts and patient representatives involved in the HTAD Rare Disease Working Group of VASCERN. It aims to provide a patient pathway that improves patient care by diminishing time to diagnosis, facilitating the establishment of a correct diagnosis using molecular genetics when possible, excluding the diagnosis in unaffected persons through appropriate family screening and avoiding overuse of resources. It is being recommended that patients are referred to an expert centre for further evaluation if they meet at least one of the following criteria: (1) thoracic aortic dissection (<70 years if hypertensive; all ages if non-hypertensive), (2) thoracic aortic aneurysm (all adults with Z score >3.5 or 2.5-3.5 if non-hypertensive or hypertensive and <60 years; all children with Z score >3), (3) family history of HTAD with/without a pathogenic variant in a gene linked to HTAD, (4) ectopia lentis without other obvious explanation and (5) a systemic score of >5 in adults and >3 in children. Aortic imaging primarily relies on transthoracic echocardiography with magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography as needed. Genetic testing should be considered in those with a high suspicion of underlying genetic aortopathy. Though panels vary among centers, for patients with thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection or systemic features these should include genes with a definitive or strong association to HTAD. Genetic cascade screening and serial aortic imaging should be considered for family screening and follow-up. In conclusion, the implementation of these strategies should help standardise the diagnostic work-up and follow-up of patients with suspected HTAD and the screening of their relatives.
36041776	treat|@CHEMICAL_Acetazolamide|@DISEASE_Intraocular_Lymphoma	Late onset sclerotomy dehiscence in a patient with Marfan syndrome presenting as recurrent episodes of raised intraocular pressure.A man in his 50s presented to the eye emergency department on three separate occasions complaining of blurred vision and discomfort in the left eye. He had a history of Marfan syndrome and had undergone bilateral 20-gauge (G) pars plana vitrectomy and lensectomy 20 years prior for ectopia lentis. On examination he had epithelial corneal oedema, raised intraocular pressure >40 mm Hg and conjunctival chemosis, which later appeared as a bleb-like conjunctival elevation. Acute treatment with oral acetazolamide and topical ocular hypotensive agents produced a marked reduction in intraocular pressure to 2-4 mm Hg. A presumed diagnosis of a leaking scleral wound was made. He underwent scleral exploration under general anaesthesia and a leaking sclerotomy was uncovered. The defect was repaired successfully using a scleral patch graft. Late dehiscence of a sclerotomy has been reported rarely in patients with Marfan syndrome. This is the first reported case to present atypically with intermittent episodes of raised intraocular pressure rather than with hypotony.

Technological advances have revolutionized genetic testing for many ophthalmic disorders, and this study aims to provide insights into the clinical utility of genetic analysis in paediatric ectopia lentis. Children that underwent lens extraction for ectopia lentis between 2013 and 2017 were identified, and gene panel testing findings and surgical outcomes were collected. Overall, 10/11 cases received a probable molecular diagnosis. Genetic variants were identified in four genes: FBN1 (associated with Marfan syndrome and cardiovascular complications; n = 6), ADAMTSL4 (associated with non-syndromic ectopia lentis; n = 2), LTBP2 (n = 1) and ASPH (n = 1). Parents appeared unaffected in 6/11 cases; the initial presentation of all six of these children was to an ophthalmologist, and only 2/6 had FBN1 variants. Notably, 4/11 cases required surgery before the age of 4 years, and only one of these children carried an FBN1 variant. In summary, in this retrospective cohort study, panel-based genetic testing pointed to a molecular diagnosis in >90% of paediatric ectopia lentis cases requiring surgery. In a subset of study participants, genetic analysis revealed changes in genes that have not been linked to extraocular manifestations and highlighted that extensive systemic investigations were not required in these individuals. We propose the introduction of genetic testing early in the diagnostic pathway in children with ectopia lentis.
37943993		Acute Aortic Dissection Type A in Younger Patients (< 60 Years Old) - Does Full Arch Replacement Provide Benefits Compared to Limited Approach?INTRODUCTION: Acute aortic dissection Stanford type A (AADA) is a surgical emergency associated with high morbidity and mortality. Although surgical management has improved, the optimal therapy is a matter of debate. Different surgical strategies have been proposed for patients under 60 years old. This paper evaluates the postoperative outcome and the need for secondary aortic operation after a limited surgical approach (proximal arch replacement) vs. extended arch repair. METHODS: Between January 2000 and January 2018, 530 patients received surgical treatment for AADA at our hospital; 182 were under 60 years old and were enrolled in this study - Group A (n=68), limited arch repair (proximal arch replacement), and group B (n=114), extended arch repair (> proximal arch replacement). RESULTS: More pericardial tamponade (P=0.005) and preoperative mechanical resuscitation (P=0.014) were seen in Group A. More need for renal replacement therapy (P=0.047) was seen in the full arch group. Mechanical ventilation time (P=0.022) and intensive care unit stay (P<0.001) were shorter in the limited repair group. Thirty-day mortality was comparable (P=0.117). New onset of postoperative stroke was comparable (Group A four patients [5.9%] vs. Group B 15 patients [13.2%]; P=0.120). Long-term follow-up did not differ significantly for secondary aortic surgery. CONCLUSION: Even though young patients received only limited arch repair, the outcome was comparable. Full-arch replacement was not beneficial in the long-time follow-up. A limited approach is justified in the cohort of young AADA patients. Exemptions, like known Marfan syndrome and the presence of an intimal tear in the arch, should be considered.
37753933		Postoperative longitudinal refractive changes in children under 8 years of age with ectopia lentis and Marfan Syndrome.PURPOSE: To evaluate the postoperative longitudinal refractive changes in children under 8 years of age with ectopia lentis and Marfan Syndrome (MFS). SETTING: Zhongshan ophthalmic center, Guangzhou, China. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. METHODS: Medical data of patients diagnosed with ectopia lentis and MFS that underwent surgery before 8 years old were collected. Refractive errors and ocular biometric parameters were collected before surgery and at each follow-up visit. Patients were stratified into groups according to age at surgery and only the eye operated upon first was selected. Multivariable analysis was performed to determine the association between refractive shift and potential risk factors. RESULTS: In total, 54 eyes of 54 patients were enrolled. The median age at surgery was 6.21 years (Interquartile range [IQR], 5.25 to 6.85) and the median follow-up was 2.0 years (IQR, 1.2 to 2.8 years). At 8 years old, patients demonstrated a median myopic shift ranged from -1.75 diopters (D) (IQR, -2.75 to -1.00 D) for the 4-year-old group to -0.13 D (IQR, -0.50 to -0.06 D) for the 7-year-old group. Multivariable analysis showed greater myopic shift was associated with younger age at surgery (P=0.004), male gender (P=0.026) and shorter preoperative axis length (P=0.005). CONCLUSION: A tendency toward increasing postoperative myopic was demonstrated in children with ectopia lentis and MFS, with the greatest myopic shift in the younger age groups. If the goal is to reach emmetropia by age 8, the immediate postoperative hypermetropic targets should be 1.75D for 4 years old, 1D for 5 years old, 0.5D for 6 years old, 0 to 0.25D for 7 years old.
36924002		Combined ascending aortobiiliac bypass and endovascular obliteration in the Bentall procedure for dual aortic aneurysms.Patients with Marfan syndrome who present with a dual aortic aneurysm are not uncommon in clinical practice; however, the management of these patients is a significant challenge. We present a unique case of aortic root aneurysm and challenging infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with a short and angulated neck. We performed simultaneous repair using the Bentall procedure and ascending aortobiiliac bypass. Endovascular obliteration of the AAA neck and bilateral common iliac arteries was also performed. The perioperative process was uneventful. Normal functioning of the mechanical valve and complete thrombosis of the AAA sac were confirmed on follow-up computed tomography and echocardiography. This report suggests that combined ascending aortobiiliac bypass and endovascular obliteration with the Bentall procedure for dual aortic aneurysm is a useful surgical strategy for patients with Marfan syndrome. Life-long follow-up and medication ought to be mandatory to prevent incomplete exclusion and bypass occlusion.
36395878		Ravitch surgery or dynamic compression bracing for pectus carinatum: a retrospective cohort study.BACKGROUND: Pectus carinatum is a pediatric condition which can be treated by dynamic compression system (DCS) bracing or surgery. Several publications concerning DCS-bracing or surgery are published, however without comparing both treatments. METHODS: Over a 10 year period 738 patients with pectus carinatum were treated. We describe our 10-years' experience and results of both treatments. RESULTS: Of the 631 patients who received DCS-bracing treatment, 553 finished treatment and 78 patients are still under treatment. Seventy-three point eight percent (n=408) of patients finished treatment successfully, 13.6% (n=75) failed treatment and 12.7% (n=70) were lost to follow-up. Success rate decreased with an increasing pressure of initial compression (84.2%-67.3%). Marfan and Poland syndrome were related to bad results.Ravitch surgery was performed in 105 patients with a success rate of 92.4%. Complications occurred in 32.4% of patients and 6.7% of patients had complications for which surgery was needed. No relationship was found between osteotomy or sternal fixation and outcomes or complications. Abramson procedure was performed in two patients. CONCLUSIONS: DCS-bracing should be the treatment of choice in patients with pectus carinatum because its non-invasiveness, good results and a lower complication rate compared to surgery. Besides pressure of initial correction, motivation is an important factor influencing outcomes and compliance remains a major challenge in treating pectus carinatum using DCS-bracing. Bracing patients before their growth spurt should be discouraged. Patients with a higher pressure of initial compression (>8.0-8.5) and Marfan and Poland syndrome have poorer outcomes. In those cases surgery may be considered.
36029951		Extrathoracic Aneurysms in Marfan Syndrome: A Systematic Review of the Literature.BACKGROUND: Marfan syndrome (MS) most often shows as thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) or aortic dissection, but it may also involve other vascular territories. This study aimed to identify those extrathoracic vascular manifestations most frequently associated with MS. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses criteria was carried out. The following databases were included: MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Health Sciences Literature (CINHAL); Spanish database MEDESY Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). RESULTS: A total of 10,008 articles were identified, leaving 155 for the first stage of data analysis (total incidence of aneurysms) and 83 for the second (descriptive data analysis). Overall, 518 aneurysms were identified: 149 in the head and neck, 94 in the extremities, and 275 in the aortic, iliac, and visceral sectors. Mostly, they were simultaneously discovered during studies of the TAA. In the abdominal aorta, the presentation with rupture in 11 of 32 patients stands out. Resection and bypass were the most frequently used methods for repair in the treated cases. CONCLUSIONS: Although its frequency in the general population is unknown, this systematic review suggests that extrathoracic aneurysmal arterial involvement in the MS may be more frequent than expected. We believe screening for aneurysms in other vascular sectors may be advisable, especially in patients with MS and TAA.
35450696		Optimizing evaluation in pediatric and young adult patients with Marfan syndrome: Novel longitudinal metrics to track growth of aortic structures.OBJECTIVE: Surveillance metrics in pediatric and young adult Marfan syndrome (pMFS) are challenging. We evaluated the utility of aortic root cross-sectional area/height index (CSA/Ht) on echocardiogram among pMFS patients as a risk stratification and surgical triage metric. METHODS: Genotype or phenotype positive pMFS patients aged 25 years or younger seen at our center from 2001 to 2020 were identified. Time-related transition to surgery was modeled using parametric methods. Predictive utility of CSA/Ht compared with aortic root diameter (ARd) and root Z score (ARz) were modeled using nonlinear multivariable parametric and nonparametric longitudinal regression models. RESULTS: Seventy-nine patients (43% female) presented at median age of 5.8 years (15th-85th percentile, 0.75-17 years) with median follow-up of 4.4 years (range, 0-18.5 years). Baseline echocardiography data were: CSA/Ht, 3.9 +- 1.4 cm2/m; ARd, 2.4 +- 0.89 cm; and ARz, 2.4 +- 1.7. CSA/Ht tracked ARd better compared with ARz (r = 0.91 vs 0.24). Eighteen patients underwent surgery. Surgical procedures included at least 2 components in 17 (aortic, mitral, tricuspid, aortic root, and arch procedures) and isolated mitral valve procedures in 1 patient. Time-related transition to surgery showed a prominent early phase to 1 year post presentation, followed by a slowly increasing late phase. CSA/Ht had a more linear correlation versus ARz during periods of rapid somatic growth in surgical patients. Surgical repair occurred at CSA/Ht between 5 and 7 cm2/m. CONCLUSIONS: CSA/Ht tracked ARd well over time. CSA/Ht between 5 and 7 cm2/m might be a promising metric for surgical triage in pMFS patients. CSA/Ht surgical threshold values in pMFS patients occurred at lower than current accepted "surgical" threshold values for CSA/Ht in adult Marfan syndrome patients.
35452326		Complex and Successful Management of a Symptomatic Isolated Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in a Pregnant Woman with Marfan Syndrome.Aortopathies associated to Marfan syndrome (MFS) are important causes of maternal death during pregnancy. We present a 27-year-old and 24-week pregnant MFS woman who arrived to the emergency department with increasing abdominal pain; an obstetric ultrasound showed an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA), a multislice computed tomography angiography (CTA) confirmed and demonstrated a 7.3 centimeter (cm) infrarenal AAA without evidence of dissection. A multidisciplinary committee determined that an open repair would lead to a significantly high maternal-fetal morbidity and mortality. Although endovascular repair (EVAR) in MFS patients remains controversial, an urgent bridge therapy was considered to be the best option. She was transferred to the angiography suite for EVAR to prevent AAA rupture and ensure a satisfactory pregnancy. The patient and fetus presented no complications during the procedure and were discharged 3 days later. She continued her pregnancy without eventualities and an elective C-section was performed on week 36. A CTA imaging at 12 months revealed type 1A and 3 endoleaks, we decided to perform endograft explant and a definitive open repair, there were no complications during the procedure, the patient is currently asymptomatic. Our case illustrates a complex decision and management that successfully avoid morbidity and mortality of a MFS mother and her product; additionally, this experience reinforces the need for lifelong and close surveillance in these patients.
35853989	cause|@CHEMICAL_Uric_Acid|@DISEASE_Death ;associate|@CHEMICAL_Uric_Acid|@DISEASE_Aortic_Dissection	A retrospective observational study of serum uric acid and in-hospital mortality in acute type A aortic dissection.There is currently insufficient evidence of correlation between on-admission serum uric acid and in-hospital mortality of patients with acute type A aortic dissection. Thus, this study analysed the relation between serum uric acid and in-hospital deaths in patients with acute type A aortic dissection. A total of 1048 patients with acute type A aortic dissection participated in this study between January 2010 and December 2018. The independent variable was on-admission serum uric acid, whilst the dependent variable was in-hospital deaths. The covariates of the study included patient age, gender, body mass index, smoking status, hypertension, diabetes, Marfan syndrome, bicuspid aortic valve, chronic renal insufficiency, stroke, atherosclerosis, time to presentation, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, aortic diameter, aortic regurgitation, abdominal vessel involvement, arch vessel involvement, ejection fraction value, laboratory parameters, symptom, coronary malperfusion, mesenteric malperfusion, cerebral malperfusion, hypotension/shock, cardiac tamponade and operation status. The mean age of the sample was 50.17 +- 11.47 years, with approximately 24.24% of the participants being female. After analysis, it was found that the admission serum uric acid of patients with acute type A aortic dissection was positively correlated with in-hospital death (OR = 1.04, 95% CI 1.02-1.06). Subsequently, a non-linear relationship was determined between admission serum uric acid (point 260 micromol/L) and in-hospital mortality for patients with acute type A aortic dissection. The effect sizes and confidence intervals of the right (serum uric acid > 260 micromol/L) and left (serum uric acid <= 260 micromol/L) aspects of the inflection point were 1.04 (1.02-1.05) and 1.00 (0.99-1.02), respectively. Furthermore, subgroup analysis indicated a stable relationship between serum uric acid and in-hospital mortality, whilst an insignificant difference was found for the interactions between different subgroups. Overall, a non-linear correlation was determined between admission serum uric acid and in-hospital mortality of patients with acute type A aortic dissection. When serum uric acid > 260 micromol/L, it showed a positive correlation with in-hospital mortality.
38302122	associate|@DISEASE_Hemoglobin_C_Disease|@GENE_HBB	Curative Therapies for Sickle Cell Disease.Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an autosomal recessive hemoglobinopathy that affects individuals worldwide. The mutation in the beta-globin gene leads to abnormal hemoglobin production, sickle hemoglobin, which polymerizes under stress leading to, among other end-organ manifestations, chronic hemolytic anemia, debilitating vaso-occlusive crises, and stroke. Unfortunately, chronic stress on end-organs impacts the life expectancy of patients with SCD, which in the United States averages 43 years, approximately 36 years less than people without the disease. Here, we review the progress made in curative interventions for those with SCD, namely allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation and gene therapy. These interventions continue to evolve as we better understand SCD pathophysiology, use new graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis regimens, expand stem cell donor options, and understand the genetic control of hemoglobin production. Although significant progress has been made, many gaps remain in the successful implementation of these interventions globally and for all patients. [Pediatr Ann. 2024;53(2):e56-e61.].
35152942		Assessment of pleural pressure during sleep in Marfan syndrome.STUDY OBJECTIVES: Patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS) have a high risk for aortic aneurysms. They are also susceptible to sleep-disordered breathing that may expose them to highly negative intrathoracic pressures known to increase aortic transmural pressure, which may accelerate aortic dilatation. Our objective was to quantify overnight intrathoracic pressure changes during sleep in snoring patients with MFS and the therapeutic effect of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). METHODS: We used a questionnaire to identify self-reported snoring patients with MFS. In these patients, we monitored intrathoracic pressure using esophageal pressure (Pes) during overnight baseline and CPAP sleep studies. We defined a peak-inspiratory Pes (Pespeak-insp) < - 5 cm H2O as greater than normal and examined the distribution of Pespeak-insp during baseline and CPAP studies. RESULTS: In our sample of 23 snorers with MFS, we found that 70% of sleep breaths exhibited Pespeak-insp < -5 cm H2O, with apnea/hypopneass accounting for only 12%, suggesting prevalent stable flow-limited breathing and snoring. In a subset (n = 12) with Pes monitoring during a CPAP night, CPAP lowered the mean proportion of breaths with Pespeak-insp < -5 cm H2O from 83.7% +- 14.9% to 3.6% +- 3.0% (P < .001). In addition, contemporaneous aortic root diameter was associated with the mean Pespeak-insp during inspiratory flow-limited breathing and apneas/hypopneas (beta = -0.05, r = .675, P = .033). CONCLUSIONS: The sleep state in MFS revealed prolonged exposure to exaggerated negative inspiratory Pes, which was reversible with CPAP. Since negative intrathoracic pressure can contribute to thoracic aortic stress and aortic dilatation, snoring may be a reversible risk factor for progression of aortic pathology in MFS.

35285871		Open surgical replacement of the descending thoracic and thoracoabdominal aorta in patients with confirmed Marfan and Loeys-Dietz syndromes: A 20-year single-centre experience.OBJECTIVES: A relatively small proportion of patients with heritable thoracic aortic disease require open surgical replacement of the distal thoracic aorta. We reviewed the outcome in patients with Marfan and Loeys-Dietz syndromes treated in an aortic centre in the United Kingdom. METHODS: We performed a single-centre retrospective study of consecutive patients treated between October 1999 and December 2019. The primary end point was 30-day mortality. Secondary end points were Kaplan-Meier estimates of medium-term survival and freedom from distal reintervention. Data are presented as median (interquartile range). RESULTS: A total of 58 patients [33 men; 51 with Marfan syndrome; median age 41 years (35-48); median aneurysm diameter 60 mm (55-74)] underwent open descending (n = 21) or thoracoabdominal aortic replacement (n = 37). All repairs were performed using cardiopulmonary bypass with hypothermic circulatory arrest in 31 patients. The 30-day mortality was 5.2% (n = 3, including 2 patients >= 60 years with significant comorbidity). Major non-fatal complications included early reoperation (n = 7), tracheostomy (n = 9), temporary renal replacement therapy (n = 3), permanent spinal cord deficit (n = 2) and permanent stroke (n = 1). Median follow-up was 81 months (48-127). Estimated (+-standard error) 5-year survival was 85% +-5%. Seven patients had distal aortic reintervention with no deaths or spinal cord deficit: estimated 5-year freedom from distal reintervention was 94% +-3%. There was no difference in survival or freedom from distal reintervention comparing: elective vs. non-elective; type of heritable thoracic aortic disease; DeBakey type; or extent of surgical repair. CONCLUSIONS: Descending thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortic replacement in patients with heritable thoracic aortic disease can be performed with low perioperative morbidity and mortality, satisfactory long-term survival and low requirement for distal reintervention.
36740496		Aortic valve reimplantation in patients with connective tissue disorders: Are the leaflets durable?OBJECTIVE: The durability of reimplanted myxomatous aortic valves in root replacements for patients with connective tissue disorders (CTD) is unclear; therefore, we sought to evaluate the long-term resilience of these repairs. METHODS: From January 1980 to January 2020, 214 patients with CTD and 645 without CTD underwent primary, elective aortic valve reimplantation operations at Cleveland Clinic. The CTD cohort included 164 (77%) with Marfan, 23 (11%) with Loeys-Dietz, and 7 (3.3%) with Ehlers-Danlos CTD. We accounted for differing patient characteristics between the groups by propensity score matching to compare outcomes, yielding 96 matched pairs. Longitudinal echocardiographic measures were compared using nonlinear mixed effects models. RESULTS: In the CTD cohort, there were no operative mortalities (30-day or in-hospital), 1 (0.47%) stroke, and 1 (0.47%) early in-hospital reoperation for valve dysfunction. Ten-year prevalence of no aortic regurgitation was 86%, mild 11%, and moderate 3%. Ten-year freedom from reoperation was 97%. In propensity matched cohorts, there were no significant differences in in-hospital outcomes, longitudinal aortic regurgitation and mean gradient, risk of reoperation on the aortic valve, or risk of late death. CONCLUSIONS: Aortic valve reimplantation is a durable operation in patients with CTD and root aneurysms. These patients do not experience early degeneration of their reimplanted aortic valves.

These approximately 300-bp sequences can cause or mediate disease by disrupting coding/splicing regions in the germline, by insertional mutagenesis in somatic cells, and in promoting formation of copy-number variants. Alu elements may also disrupt epigenetic regulation by affecting non-coding regulatory regions. There are increasing reports of apparently sporadic and inherited genetic disorders caused by Alu-related gene disruption, but Marfan syndrome resulting from Alu element insertion has not been previously described. We report a family with classic features of Marfan syndrome whose previous FBN1 genetic testing was inconclusive. Using contemporary next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics analysis, a pathogenic/disruptive Alu insertion occurring in the coding region of the FBN1 gene was identified (c.6564_6565insAlu; p. Glu2189fs) and was confirmed and specified further with Sanger sequencing. This identified the molecular basis of disease in the family that was missed using previous genetic testing technologies and highlights a novel pathogenic mechanism for Marfan syndrome. This case adds to the growing literature of Mendelian diseases caused by Alu retrotransposition, and it also shows the growing capability of genomic technologies for detecting atypical mutation events.
37327953		A Systematic Review Supporting the Society for Vascular Surgery Guidelines on the Management of Heritable Aortopathies.BACKGROUND: To support the development of clinical practice guidelines on the management of patients with genetic aortopathies and arteriopathies, a writing committee from the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) has commissioned this systematic review. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and searched multiple databases for studies addressing six questions identified by the SVS guideline committee about evaluating and managing patients with genetic aortopathies and arteriopathies. Studies were selected and appraised by pairs of independent reviewers. RESULTS: We included 12 studies in this systematic review. We did not identify studies about the long-term outcomes of endovascular repair for aortic aneurysm in patients with heritable aortopathy or about new aortic events in pregnant women with a history of aortic dissection or aneurysm. A small case series demonstrated 100% survival rate and 100% aortic intervention-free survival at 15 months (range 7-28 months) following endograft repair for type B aortic dissection. A positive genetic diagnosis was discovered in 36% of patients with aortic aneurysms and dissections who had no risk factors for hereditary aortopathies, and these patients had a mortality rate of 11% at a median follow-up duration of 5 months. Black patients had lower 30-day mortality than White patients (5.6% vs. 9%; respectively), but they had a higher overall aortic reintervention rate at 30-day post-aortic dissection repair (47% vs. 27%; respectively). Aortic reinterventions due to aneurysmal expansion and endoleak at 30 days were higher in Black patients than White patients. The certainty of evidence was judged to be very low across all the outcomes evaluated in this systematic review. CONCLUSION: The available evidence suggests high survival after TEVAR for type B aortic dissection in young patients with heritable aortopathies but with limited long-term follow-up. Genetic testing in patients with acute aortic aneurysms and dissections had a high yield. It was positive for most patients with risk factors for hereditary aortopathies and in over a third for all other patients, and was associated with new aortic events within 15 years.

This study aimed to perform clinical PGT-M in a family with a history of MFS1 for two generations. A family with two members affected by MFS1 approached the hospital for PGT-M. The couple decided to join the project following extensive counselling and informed consent was obtained. The mutation contributory to MFS1 was identified using whole-exome sequencing (WES). A novel PGT-M protocol using multiplex fluorescent PCR and mini-sequencing was developed and tested. Ten blastocysts were subjected to PGT-M in two clinical PGT cycles. Mini-sequencing revealed four normal and six affected embryos. Microsatellite-based linkage analysis confirmed mutation analysis results in all samples. The embryos diagnosed as normal (non-MFS1) were chosen for transfer. A pregnancy was obtained in the third embryo transfer. Invasive prenatal diagnosis confirmed the normal genotype of the baby. This study demonstrated comprehensive management using the application of clinical-based diagnosis, WES for mutation identification within the MFS1 gene, mini-sequencing for embryo selection and microsatellite-based linkage analysis for backup of PGT-M results and contamination detection to assist couples in having a healthy child when there was a family history of Marfan syndrome.Impact StatementWhat is already known on this subject? Marfan syndrome (MFS1, OMIM#154700) is an autosomal dominant condition causing aortopathy including fatal aortic dissection. Pre-implantation genetic testing (PGT) is an alternative to traditional invasive prenatal diagnosis (PND) giving the couples the chance of starting pregnancy with the confidence that the baby will be unaffected. Most of the previous PGT reports employed microsatellite-based linkage analysis. A few PGT studies used sequencing, mini-sequencing and mutation analysis; however, the details of the techniques were not described.What do the results of this study add? Single-cell PCR protocol using multiplex fluorescent PCR and mini-sequencing was developed and validated. Two clinical PGTs cycles for Marfan syndrome were performed. A healthy baby was resulted. The details of multiplex fluorescent PCR and mini-sequencing protocols are described in this study so that the procedures can be reproduced.What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? Embryo selection can help the family suffering from Marfan syndrome for two generations to start a pregnancy with confidence that their child will be unaffected. This study also shows the use of a mini-sequencing protocol for PGT, which can be a universal protocol for other mutations by changing the PCR primers and mini-sequencing primers.
36661250		Outcomes for Treatment of Capsulolabral Adhesions With a Capsular Spacer During Revision Hip Arthroscopy.BACKGROUND: The presence of adhesions is a common source of pain and dysfunction after hip arthroscopic surgery and an indication for revision surgery. The placement of a capsular spacer in the capsulolabral recess after lysis of adhesions has been developed to treat and prevent the recurrence of adhesions. PURPOSE: To evaluate patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and survivorship at a minimum of 2 years after revision hip arthroscopic surgery with capsular spacer placement for capsular adhesions. STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: Between January 2013 and June 2018, a total of 95 patients (99 hips) aged >=18 years underwent revision hip arthroscopic surgery for the treatment of capsular adhesions with the placement of a capsular spacer. Overall, 53 patients (56 hips) met the inclusion criteria and had a minimum 2-year follow-up, forming the cohort of this study. Exclusion criteria included confounding metabolic bone diseases (eg, Legg-Calve-Perthes disease, Marfan syndrome), labral deficiency, or advanced osteoarthritis (Tonnis grade 2 or 3). Preoperative and postoperative outcome scores (modified Harris Hip Score [mHHS], Hip Outcome Score-Activities of Daily Living [HOS-ADL], Hip Outcome Score-Sport-Specific Subscale [HOS-SSS], 12-Item Short Form Health Survey [SF-12], and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index [WOMAC]) were collected and compared in addition to the revision rate, conversion to total hip arthroplasty, and patient satisfaction. RESULTS: The mean age of the cohort was 32 +- 11 years, with 32 female hips (57%) and a median number of previous hip arthroscopic procedures of 1 (range, 1-5). The arthroplasty- and revision-free survivorship rate at 2 years was 91%. Overall, 5 patients (6 hips; 11%) underwent revision surgery at a mean of 2.4 +- 1.4 years after capsular spacer placement, with symptomatic capsular defects being the most common finding. There were 4 patients (7%) who converted to total hip arthroplasty. For hips not requiring subsequent surgery (n = 46), there was a significant improvement in outcome scores except for the SF-12 Mental Component Summary, with rates of achieving the minimal clinically important difference of 70%, 70%, and 65% for the mHHS, HOS-ADL, and HOS-SSS, respectively. CONCLUSION: Capsular spacers, as part of a systematic approach including lysis of adhesions with early and consistent postoperative physical therapy including circumduction exercises, resulted in improved PROs as well as high arthroplasty- and revision-free survivorship (91%) at a minimum 2-year follow-up. Capsular spacers should be considered in revision hip arthroscopic procedures when an adequate labral volume remains but adhesions continue to be a concern.
35384050		Valve-sparing versus valve-replacing aortic root replacement in patients with aortic root aneurysm.BACKGROUND: Valve-sparing aortic root replacement (VSARR) is an alternative to valve-replacing aortic root replacement (VRARR) with valved-conduits based on recent guidelines for clinical practice. This study investigated outcomes of these two procedures in patients with nonstenotic valves. METHODS: Between January 7, 2007 and June 30, 2019, 475 patients with aortic root aneurysm without aortic stenosis underwent VSARR (151) or VRARR (324) techniques. Propensity score-matching (PSM) was used to alleviate confounding. Endpoints were 30-day mortality, 8-year survival and reoperation, aortic regurgitation, and valve gradients. RESULTS: PSM created 69 pairs of patients with a mean age 52 +- 13 years (10.1% Marfan syndrome, 34.8% bicuspid aortic valve). There was no statistically significant difference in major perioperative morbidity or 30-day mortality (0% VSARR vs. 1.4% VRARR; p = 0.316). Overall survival was significantly higher (p = 0.025) in the VSARR group versus the VRARR group (8-year estimates 100% vs. 88.9%, respectively), while freedom from valve reoperation was similar (p = 0.97, 8-year estimates 90.9% vs. 96.7%, respectively). Freedom from > moderate-severe AR was not significantly different (p = 0.08, 8-year estimates 90.0% VSARR group vs. 100% VRARR), but mean valve gradients at last follow-up were better in the VSARR group (5.9 vs. 13.2 mmHg, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: VSARR is a safe operation in patients with aortic root aneurysm and nonstenotic aortic valves in the hands of experienced surgeons. Freedom from reoperation is similar and the mode of aortic valve failure differs between the two groups.
36269370		Assessment of aortic diameter in Marfan patients: intraindividual comparison of 3D-Dixon and 2D-SSFP magnetic resonance imaging.OBJECTIVES: To compare the accuracy and precision of 3D-Dixon and 2D-SSFP MR-imaging for assessment of aortic diameter in Marfan patients. METHODS: This prospective single-center study investigated respiratory-gated 3D-Dixon and breath-hold 2D-SSFP non-contrast MR-imaging at 3 T in 47 Marfan patients (36.0 +- 13.2 years, 28 ,19 ). Two radiologists performed individual diameter measurements at five levels of the thoracic aorta and evaluated image quality on a four-grade scale (1 = poor, 4 = excellent) and artifacts (1 = severe, 4 = none). Aortic root diameters acquired by echocardiography served as a reference standard. Intraclass correlation coefficient, Bland-Altman analyses, F-test, t-test, and regression analyses were used to assess agreement between observers and methods. RESULTS: Greatest aortic diameters were observed at the level of the sinuses of Valsalva (SOV) for 3D-Dixon (38.2 +- 6.8 mm) and 2D-SSFP (38.3 +- 7.1 mm) (p = 0.53). Intra- and interobserver correlation of diameter measurements was excellent at all aortic levels for both 3D-Dixon (r = 0.94-0.99 and r = 0.94-0.98) and 2D-SSFP (r = 0.96-1.00 and r = 0.95-0.99). 3D-Dixon-derived and 2D-SSFP-derived diameter measurements at the level of the SOV revealed a strong correlation with echocardiographic measurements (r = 0.92, p < 0.001 and r = 0.93, p < 0.001, respectively). The estimated mean image quality at the level of SOV was higher for 2D-SSFP compared to that for 3D-Dixon (3.3 (95%-CI: 3.1-3.5) vs. 2.9 (95%-CI: 2.7-3.1)) (p < 0.001). Imaging artifacts were less at all aortic levels for 3D-Dixon compared to 2D-SSFP (3.4-3.8 vs. 2.8-3.1) (all p < 0.002). CONCLUSION: Respiratory-gated 3D-Dixon and breath-hold 2D-SSFP MR-imaging provide accurate and precise aortic diameter measurements. We recommend 3D-Dixon imaging for monitoring of aortic diameter in Marfan patients due to fewer imaging artifacts and the possibility of orthogonal multiplanar reformations of the aortic root. KEY POINTS:   Respiratory-gated 3D-Dixon and breath-hold 2D-SSFP imaging provide accurate and precise aortic diameter measurements in patients suffering from Marfan syndrome.   Imaging artifacts are stronger in 2D-SFFP imaging than in 3D-Dixon imaging.   We recommend 3D-Dixon imaging for monitoring of aortic diameter in Marfan patients due to fewer imaging artifacts and the possibility of orthogonal multiplanar reformations.
35275761		D-dimer in Marfan syndrome: effect of obstructive sleep apnea induced blood pressure surges.Aortic dissection and rupture are the major causes of premature death in persons with Marfan syndrome (MFS), a rare genetic disorder featuring cardiovascular, skeletal, and ocular impairments. We and others have found that obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) confers significant vascular stress in this population and may accelerate aortic disease progression. We hypothesized that D-dimer, a diagnostic biomarker for several types of vascular injury that is also elevated in persons with MFS with aortic enlargement, may be sensitive to cardiovascular stresses caused by OSA. To test this concept, we recruited 16 persons with MFS without aortic dissection and randomized them to two nights of polysomnography, without (baseline) and with OSA treatment: continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). In addition to scoring OSA by the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), beat-by-beat systolic BP (SBP) and pulse-pressure (PP) fluctuations were quantified. Morning blood samples were also assayed for D-dimer levels. In this cohort (male:female, 10:6; age, 36 +- 13 yr; aortic diameter, 4 +- 1 cm), CPAP eliminated OSA (AHI: 20 +- 17 vs. 3 +- 2 events/h, P = 0.001) and decreased fluctuations in SBP (13 +- 4 vs. 9 +- 3 mmHg, P = 0.011) and PP (7 +- 2 vs. 5 +- 2 mmHg, P = 0.013). CPAP also reduced D-dimer levels from 1,108 +- 656 to 882 +- 532 ng/mL (P = 0.023). Linear regression revealed a positive association between the maximum PP during OSA and D-dimer in both the unadjusted (r = 0.523, P = 0.038) and a model adjusted for contemporaneous aortic root diameter (r = 0.733, P = 0.028). Our study revealed that overnight CPAP reduces D-dimer levels commensurate with the elimination of OSA and concomitant hemodynamic fluctuations. Morning D-dimer measurements together with OSA screening might serve as predictors of vascular injury in MFS.NEW & NOTEWORTHY What is New? Surges in blood pressure caused by obstructive sleep apnea during sleep increase vascular stress and D-dimer levels in Marfan syndrome. Elevations in D-dimer can be lowered with CPAP. What is Noteworthy? D-dimer levels might serve as a marker for determining the significance of obstructive sleep apnea in persons with Marfan syndrome. D-dimer or obstructive sleep apnea screening is a potential method to identify persons with Marfan syndrome at risk for adverse cardiovascular events.
35691461		Endovascular and Hybrid Repair in Patients with Heritable Thoracic Aortic Disease.BACKGROUND: In individuals with heritable thoracic aortic disease (HTAD), endovascular repair for treatment of aortic aneurysm and dissection may be lifesaving, but is associated with increased risk of failure of endovascular repair and adverse outcomes. This study reports our experience with early and late outcomes of endovascular aortic and branch vessel repair in patients with HTAD. METHODS: A retrospective case series was performed by chart review of individuals with HTAD followed at Washington University School of Medicine/Barnes-Jewish Hospital who underwent endovascular aortic and/or branch vessel repair. Clinical features, imaging characteristics, and short- and long-term outcomes were collected. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients with HTAD (20 male; mean age 45 +- 13 years) underwent 37 endovascular procedures between 2006 and 2020 with mean follow up of 54 +- 41 months. Seven patients underwent two or more separate endovascular procedures. Each procedure was considered separate for data collection and analysis. Underlying conditions included Marfan syndrome (n = 16 procedures), Loeys-Dietz syndrome (n = 14 procedures), vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (n = 3 procedures), and nonsyndromic HTAD (n = 4 procedures). Twenty patients (69%) had prior open surgical aortic repair. Indications for endovascular aortic repair (n = 31) included urgent repairs of acute complications of aortic dissection (n = 10) or aneurysm rupture (n = 3), and elective aortic repair (n = 18; 10 chronic dissections and eight chronic aneurysms). Six patients underwent elective endovascular repair of six branch vessel aneurysms or dissections. Six patients underwent hybrid open surgical and endovascular repair. Of the 37 procedures, 25 (68%) proximal landing zones were in the native aorta or branch vessel, 11 (30%) were in a surgical graft or elephant trunk and one was in a previously placed endograft. Thirty-six (97%) procedures were technically successful, and none required emergency surgical conversion. Two patients died: one from sepsis and one from presumed late pseudoaneurysm rupture, for a 5% per-procedure mortality rate. Two procedures were complicated by stroke and one patient developed paraparesis. Of the 31 aortic procedures, seven aortic endografts (23%) developed a stent-induced new entry (SINE) discovered with imaging at 20 +- 15 days post-procedure. Seven endografts (23%) developed a Type I endoleak and eight (26%) developed a Type II endoleak. No Type III endoleaks were seen. Within 30 days, two endografts (of 37, 5%) required reintervention. After 30 days, fifteen additional endografts (of 37, 41%) required reintervention. Two patients (of 6, 33%) who underwent hybrid repair required reintervention. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the largest single-center case series examining outcomes of HTAD patients following endovascular repair. Urgent and elective endovascular repairs in patients with HTAD can manage acute and chronic complications of aortic aneurysm and dissection with relatively low risk. However, risk of early and late endoleaks and SINE is high. Close post-procedural surveillance is required, and many individuals will require additional interventions. Hybrid repair shows promise and requires further investigation.

In our previous studies, we have found that a substantial proportion of patients with skeletal deformity could be explained by monogenic disorders. More recently, complex phenotypes caused by more than one genetic defect (i.e., dual molecular diagnosis) have also been reported in skeletal deformities and may complicate the diagnostic odyssey of patients. In this study, we report the molecular and phenotypic characteristics of patients with dual molecular diagnosis and variable skeletal deformities. RESULTS: From 1108 patients who underwent exome sequencing, we identified eight probands with dual molecular diagnosis and variable skeletal deformities. All eight patients had dual diagnosis consisting of two autosomal dominant diseases. A total of 16 variants in 12 genes were identified, 5 of which were of de novo origin. Patients with dual molecular diagnosis presented blended phenotypes of two genetic diseases. Mendelian disorders occurred more than once include Osteogenesis Imperfecta Type I (COL1A1, MIM:166200), Neurofibromatosis, Type I (NF1, MIM:162200) and Marfan Syndrome (FBN1, MIM:154700). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the complicated skeletal phenotypes associated with dual molecular diagnosis. Exome sequencing represents a powerful tool to detect such complex conditions.

Methods: This retrospective study included all cases of ectopia lentis that presented between June 2015 and March 2019 in a tertiary care center. They were reviewed retrospectively. The corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), severity of lens subluxation, type of surgery, intra-operative and post-operative complication, and specular count were recorded. Results: Seventy-eight eyes of 57 cases with a mean age at surgery of 14.73 years were analyzed. Intra-lenticular lens aspiration was the most common (n-62/78; 79.5%) surgical procedure followed by lens aspiration, intra-capsular cataract extraction, phaco-aspiration, and pars-plana lensectomy. Simultaneous intra-ocular lens (IOL) implantation was performed in 46.2% (n-32/78) of the eyes. The mean CDVA improved from 0.85 +- 0.55 logMAR to 0.44 +- 0.29 logMAR at 6 weeks follow-up. The post-operative CDVA was significantly better in the pseudo-phakic group compared to the aphakic group (p-0.02). The patient's age at the time of surgery and the degree of subluxation did not impact the final visual outcome. Intra-operative complication included vitreous hemorrhage (n-1) and lens matter drop (n-1). Post-operative complications were noted in 26.9% of the eyes (n-21/78) with a higher complication rate in the pseudo-phakic group (p-0.00). A second intervention was required in 7.7% of the eyes (n-6/78). Conclusion: Age and degree of subluxation at the time of surgery do not influence the final visual outcome in cases of ectopia lentis undergoing lens extraction surgery. IOL implantation results in better visual outcomes but is associated with a high complication rate.
37773813		Reduced volume and altered composition of paraspinal muscles in Marfan syndrome: A retrospective cohort study.Retrospective cohort study. Spinal deformities in patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS) are distinct from those in patients with idiopathic scoliosis (IS). It is more prone to progression and more likely to present with sagittal malalignment than IS. However, the etiology of this characteristic spinal deformity in MFS remains unclear. This study aimed to determine the spinal musculature characteristics in patients with MFS on the hypothesis that the paraspinal muscles of patients with MFS would be qualitatively or quantitatively different from those of patients with IS. Seventeen consecutive patients with MFS aged 25 years or younger undergoing surgery for scoliosis in our hospital were compared with age- and sex-matched patients with IS undergoing surgery for scoliosis. The body size-adjusted relative cross-sectional area (rCSA), fatty infiltration ratio (FI%), and relative functional cross-sectional area (rFCSA) of the psoas muscles (PM) and paravertebral muscles (PVM) at L3/4 and L4/5 were measured using preoperative T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Functional CSA was defined as total CSA minus the fatty infiltration area of each muscle and rFCSA was calculated as the body size-adjusted functional CSA. The rCSA of the PM at L3/4 and L4/5 was significantly smaller in the MFS group than in the IS group (L3/4, P = .021; L4/5, P = .002). The FI% of the PM at L4/5 was significantly higher in the MFS group (P = .044). Consequently, the rFCSA of the PM at L3/4 and L4/5 and the rFCSA of the PVM at L3/4 in the MFS group were significantly smaller than those in the IS group (PM at L3/4, P = .021; PM at L4/5, P = .001; PVM at L3/4, P = .025). Compared with patients with IS, patients with MFS exhibited significantly decreased body-size-adjusted CSA of the PM and reduced body-size-adjusted functional CSA of the PVM and PM. These findings may partially explain the characteristics of distinctive spinal deformities in patients with MFS.
37861579		Absent right superior vena cava and persistent left superior vena cava: An incidental finding.A patient with Marfan syndrome undergoing Bentall operation was found to have an absent right superior vena cava and persistent left superior vena cava. The dilation of coronary sinus raised the suspicion of persistent left superior vena cava. The diagnosis was confirmed by agitated saline contrast echocardiography and computed tomography of the chest.
35428473		Association of initial management on readmissions for spontaneous pneumothorax in adolescents.BACKGROUND: In adolescents, initial treatment of spontaneous pneumothorax (PTX) must balance the recurrence risk with invasiveness. While institutional series have sought to define the role of early intervention, large-scale analysis is lacking. The present study aimed to evaluate the impact of initial strategy on recurrence and resource utilization in a nationally representative cohort. METHODS: Patients (10-20 years) admitted for first-time pneumothorax were identified using the 2010-2019 Nationwide Readmissions Database. Based on the initial management strategy, patients were classified as nonoperative management, chest tube drainage only, and operative intervention. Multivariable regression was used to evaluate the impact of approach on outcomes of interest. The primary outcome was recurrence within 90 days, while length of stay and hospitalization costs were secondarily considered. RESULTS: Of an estimated 20,887 patients, 35.5% were classified as nonoperative management, 35.2% as chest tube drainage only, and 29.2% as operative intervention. Compared to others, the operative intervention cohort more frequently had Marfan syndrome and emphysematous blebs. After adjustment, patients initially managed operatively experienced lower odds of recurrence (adjusted odds ratio: 0.48, 95% confidence interval: 0.36-0.64), while chest tube drainage only had increased risk (adjusted odds ratio: 1.93, 95% confidence interval: 1.59-2.34) with nonoperative management as reference. Incremental 90-day length of stay was greater in operative intervention (beta: +2.4 days, 95% confidence interval: 1.8-3.0) compared to nonoperative management, but 90-day costs were similar. CONCLUSION: Initial operative management for first-time pneumothorax appears to reduce risk of recurrence while demonstrating similar total costs. Due to high recurrence rates associated with conservative approaches, initial surgical intervention may be considered in this patient population.
35595210		Endovascular Repair in Patients with Marfan Syndrome: Concerns Amid Controversy.Endovascular aortic repair is widely used to treat patients with degenerative aneurysms or aortic dissection within the distal aorta. Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) is generally associated with fewer short-term complications than open surgical repair, which is particularly important for older patients with significant comorbid conditions. However, for patients with Marfan syndrome, a heritable thoracic aortic disease associated with aortic dilatation, dissection, and rupture, the utility of endovascular aortic repair remains questionable. Marfan patients have friable aortic tissue and are typically treated at a relatively young age with few comorbidities; they therefore have less operative risk and need a durable solution. Furthermore, those who need distal aortic repair tend to have chronic aortic dissection. Although TEVAR is generally superior to open surgery with regard to short-term complications, it is less durable, and TEVAR reintervention rates are highest in patients with chronic aortic dissection. Thus, Marfan patients seeking definitive aortic repair are often better served by open repair. Nonetheless, TEVAR may be useful in patients with Marfan syndrome as a bridge to open repair or as treatment for late complications of previous open repair.
35679177	associate|@DISEASE_Marfan_Syndrome|@GENE_FBN1 ;associate|@DISEASE_Aneurysm_False|@GENE_FBN1	A unique cardiovascular presentation of Marfan syndrome.We report a neonate with severe Marfan syndrome (MS), prenatally identified to have persistent atrial tachycardia, biventricular dysfunction, and an unusual structure within the atria. Detailed postnatal echocardiographic evaluation and cross-sectional imaging confirmed congenital pseudoaneurysm of the mitral-aortic intervalvular fibrosa. Emergent testing by next-generation sequencing identified a FBN1 pathological variant, key to establishing goals of care. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a congenital pseudoaneurysm of the mitral-aortic intervalvular fibrosa in MS.
