37374344		Autonomic and Vascular Responses during Reactive Hyperemia in Healthy Individuals and Patients with Sickle Cell Anemia.Background and Objectives: To compare autonomic and vascular responses during reactive hyperemia (RH) between healthy individuals and patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA). Materials and Methods: Eighteen healthy subjects and 24 SCA patients were subjected to arterial occlusion for 3 min at the lower right limb level. The pulse rate variability (PRV) and pulse wave amplitude were measured through photoplethysmography using the Angiodin  PD 3000 device, which was placed on the first finger of the lower right limb 2 min before (Basal) and 2 min after the occlusion. Pulse peak intervals were analyzed using time-frequency (wavelet transform) methods for high-frequency (HF: 0.15-0.4) and low-frequency (LF: 0.04-0.15) bands, and the LF/HF ratio was calculated. Results: The pulse wave amplitude was higher in healthy subjects compared to SCA patients, at both baseline and post-occlusion (p < 0.05). Time-frequency analysis showed that the LF/HF peak in response to the post-occlusion RH test was reached earlier in healthy subjects compared to SCA patients. Conclusions: Vasodilatory function, as measured by PPG, was lower in SCA patients compared to healthy subjects. Moreover, a cardiovascular autonomic imbalance was present in SCA patients with high sympathetic and low parasympathetic activity in the basal state and a poor response of the sympathetic nervous system to RH. Early cardiovascular sympathetic activation (10 s) and vasodilatory function in response to RH were impaired in SCA patients.
37541800		Global burden of transfusion in sickle cell disease.Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common hereditary hemoglobinopathy. The underlying pathophysiology of the red blood cell (RBC) leads to pan-systemic complications which manifest at an early age. While curative and disease-modifying treatments exist for SCD, a key intervention in the management and treatment of SCD is RBC transfusion, which can alleviate or prevent many complications. SCD patients often require chronic RBC transfusion therapy which can result in complications, such as iron overload, alloimmunization and infection. In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), SCD patients lack appropriate access to healthcare such as newborn screening, health education, prophylaxis for infection, and treatments to reduce both mortality and SCD-related adverse effects. Poor access to RBCs for transfusion, coupled with donated blood not meeting safety standards set by the World Health Organization, presents a significant barrier for patients requiring chronic transfusions in LMICs. Unmet needs associated with blood collection, blood component processing and recipient matching all pose a serious problem in many LMICs, although this varies depending on geographic location, political organizations and economy. This review aims to provide an overview of the global burden of SCD, focusing on the availability of current treatments and the burden of chronic RBC transfusions in patients with SCD.
35929611		The effect of intensity of conditioning regimen on the outcome of HSCT in children with sickle cell disease.BACKGROUND: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) provides a cure for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). This study describes the effect of conditioning regimen intensity on HSCT outcomes among children younger than 14 years with SCD. METHODS: Transplants from HLA-matched related donors (MRD) and unrelated donors (MUD) using either myeloablative conditioning (MAC) regimens or reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens were considered. Event-free survival (EFS) was the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS) and occurrence of GVHD. RESULTS: 48 SCD patients underwent HSCT, 45 (93.8%) patients had MRD, 1 (2.1%) had 9/10 related donor, and 2 (4.1%) had MUD. The median age at transplant was 8.6 years (range, 3.1-13.8). Conditioning regimens were myeloablative (MAC) in 41 (85.4%) patients and of reduced intensity in 7 (14.6%) patients. EFS at 2 years was 100% among MAC group compared to 29% in the RIC group (p < .001). The median follow-up was 43.4 months (range 26.8-134). All events in the RIC group were secondary graft failure. However, OS was 100% in both groups at 2 years. Acute GVHD II-IV was diagnosed in 2 (4.1%) patients. Chronic GVHD occurred in 2 (4.1%) patients. GVHD did not occur in patients who underwent MUD HSCT. CONCLUSIONS: MAC in children with SCD is well tolerated and associated with an excellent outcome for HLA-matched HSCT in SCD. There was a high rate of secondary graft failure with the use of RIC. Future studies are needed to optimize RIC regimens in HSCT of children with SCD.
37023225	associate|@CHEMICAL_Oxygen|@DISEASE_Status_Asthmaticus	Managing Sickle Cell Disease in Patients for Whom Blood Transfusion Is Not an Option.Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is a hereditary blood disorder affecting beta hemoglobin. This disorder causes sickle-shaped red blood cells with decreased oxygen-carrying capacity resulting in vaso-occlusive crises. These crises are often treated with analgesics, antibiotics, IV fluids, supplementary oxygen, and allogeneic blood transfusion. This treatment regimen becomes complicated when caring for SCD patients for whom blood transfusion is not an option. Blood transfusion may not be an option due to the patient's religious, personal, or medical concerns and in scenarios where blood is not available for transfusion. Some examples include the patient being a Jehovah's Witness, blood-borne pathogens concerns, or prior history of multiple alloantibodies and severe transfusion reactions. The number of patients in these categories is growing. The patients and their autonomy should be respected during treatment. This review focuses on the currently available modalities to best manage this subgroup of SCD patients without blood transfusion, including new professional guidelines and new therapies to reduce the severity of SCD as approved by the Food and Drug Administration since 2017.
36790450		A Qualitative Systematic Review of Pediatric Patient and Caregiver Perspectives on Pain Management for Vaso-Occlusive Episodes in the Emergency Department.OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this study is to describe the experiences of pediatric patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and their caregivers who have presented to the emergency department (ED) for management of vaso-occlusive pain events. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative systematic review. The search protocol was developed to identify both published and unpublished literature that met inclusion/exclusion criteria. Included articles were primary hospital-based research with study populations that included (but were not limited to) pediatric patients aged 21 years or younger and qualitative or mixed-method analysis. RESULTS: Four themes were identified: (1) patients and caregivers perceive the ED as the last resort; (2) health care professionals in the ED lacked knowledge about SCD but rejected patients' and caregiver's attempts to share experience or advocate for their needs; (3) patients' accounts of pain are doubted because they do not always have "typical" signs of pain; and (4) caregivers identify racism as a reason for suboptimal care in the ED. CONCLUSIONS: There are multiple opportunities to improve management for vaso-occlusive pain events in the ED, including education of health care providers about SCD and complications, partnership between patients/caregivers and providers, and efforts to reduce the impact of systemic racism on health care delivery.
35605629		Post-discharge morbidity and mortality in children admitted with severe anaemia and other health conditions in malaria-endemic settings in Africa: a systematic review and meta-analysis.BACKGROUND: Severe anaemia is associated with high in-hospital mortality among young children. In malaria-endemic areas, surviving children also remain at increased risk of mortality for several months after hospital discharge. We aimed to compare the risks of morbidity and mortality among children discharged from hospital after recovery from severe anaemia versus other health conditions in malaria-endemic settings in Africa. METHODS: Following PRISMA guidelines, we searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central from inception to Nov 30, 2021, without language restrictions, for prospective or retrospective cohort studies and randomised controlled trials that followed up children younger than 15 years for defined periods after hospital discharge in malaria-endemic countries in Africa. We excluded the intervention groups in trials and studies or subgroups involving children with sickle cell anaemia, malignancies, or surgery or trauma, or those reporting follow-up data that were combined with the in-hospital period. Two independent reviewers extracted the data and assessed the quality and risk of bias using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale or the Cochrane Collaboration's tool. The coprimary outcomes were all-cause death and all-cause readmissions 6 months after discharge. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42017079282. FINDINGS: Of 2930 articles identified in our search, 27 studies were included. For children who were recently discharged following hospital admission with severe anaemia, all-cause mortality by 6 months was higher than during the in-hospital period (n=5 studies; Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio 1 72, 95% CI 1 22-2 44; p=0 0020; I2=51 5%) and more than two times higher than children previously admitted without severe anaemia (n=4 studies; relative risk [RR] 2 69, 95% CI 1 59-4 53; p<0 0001; I2=69 2%). Readmissions within 6 months of discharge were also more common in children admitted with severe anaemia than in children admitted with other conditions (n=1 study; RR 3 05, 1 12-8 35; p<0 0001). Children admitted with severe acute malnutrition (regardless of severe anaemia) also had a higher 6-month mortality after discharge than those admitted for other reasons (n=2 studies; RR=3 12, 2 02-4 68; p<0 0001; I2=54 7%). Other predictors of mortality after discharge included discharge against medical advice, HIV, bacteraemia, and hypoxia. INTERPRETATION: In malaria-endemic settings in Africa, children admitted to hospital with severe anaemia and severe acute malnutrition are at increased risk of mortality in the first 6 months after discharge compared with children admitted with other health conditions. Improved strategies are needed for the management of these high-risk groups during the period after discharge. FUNDING: Research Council of Norway and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Young patients with SCD have elevated effective renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rates, which decrease to normal ranges in young adulthood and subnormal levels with advancing age. The pathophysiology of SCD-related nephropathy is multifactorial - oxidative stress, hyperfiltration and glomerular hypertension are all contributing factors. Albuminuria, which is an early clinical manifestation of glomerular damage, is common in individuals with SCD. Kidney function declines more rapidly in individuals with SCD than in those with sickle cell trait or in healthy individuals. Multiple genetic modifiers, including APOL1, HMOX1, HBA1 and HBA2 variants are also implicated in the development and progression of SCD-related nephropathy. Chronic kidney disease and rapid decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate are associated with increased mortality in adults with SCD. Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors are the standard of care treatment for albuminuria in SCD, despite a lack of controlled studies demonstrating their long-term efficacy. Multiple studies of novel therapeutic agents are ongoing, and patients with SCD and kidney failure should be evaluated for kidney transplantation. Given the high prevalence and severe consequences of kidney disease, additional studies are needed to elucidate the pathophysiology, natural history and treatment of SCD-related nephropathy.
33979369		Cardiovascular benefits of a home-based exercise program in patients with sickle cell disease.BACKGROUND: Physical inactivity is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The benefits of exercise in patients with chronic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, are well established. For patients with sickle cell disease, medical recommendation was to avoid physical exercise for fear of triggering painful crises or increasing the impairment of the cardiopulmonary function. Only recently, studies have shown safety in exercise programs for this population. Despite that, there is no report that assess the effects of physical exercise on cardiac parameters in patients with sickle cell disease. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the impact of regular physical exercise (a home-based program) on cardiovascular function in patients with sickle cell disease. DESIGN: A quasi-randomized prospective controlled trial. SETTING: During the years 2015 and 2016, we started recruiting among adult patients treated at a Brazilian Center for Patients with Sickle Cell Disease to participate in a study involving a home exercise program. The experimental (exercise) and control groups were submitted to clinical evaluation and cardiovascular tests before and after the intervention. Analysis of variance was applied to compare groups, considering time and group factors. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-seven adult outpatients with a sickle cell disease diagnosis. INTERVENTIONS: Exercise group (N = 14): a regular home-based aerobic exercise program, three to five times per week not exceeding give times per week, for eight weeks; no prescription for the control group (N = 13). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Echocardiographic and treadmill test parameters. RESULTS: The exercise group showed significant improvement in cardiovascular tests, demonstrated by increased distance traveled on a treadmill (p<0.01), increased ejection fraction (p < 0.01) and improvement of diastolic function assessed by mitral tissue Doppler E' wave on echocardiography (p = 0.04). None of the patients presented a sickle cell crisis or worsening of symptoms during the exercise program. CONCLUSION: The selected home-based exercise program is safe, feasible, and promotes a favorable impact on functional capacity and cardiovascular function in sickle cell disease patients.

This study tested the hypothesis that elevated cerebral blood flow and oxygen extraction fraction are associated with lower executive function in individuals with sickle cell anemia. METHODS: Three-Tesla brain magnetic resonance imaging was performed, including anatomic, gray matter cerebral blood flow, and global oxygen extraction fraction imaging. Executive function was measured using the working memory index from an age-appropriate Wechsler battery and tasks from the National Institutes of Health Toolbox Cognition Battery. Bivariate and multivariate models were examined (significance: P<0.05). RESULTS: Fifty-four participants (age range=6-31 years) with sickle cell anemia were enrolled. Hematocrit was positively related to fluid cognition, cerebral blood flow was inversely related to working memory and inhibitory control, and oxygen extraction fraction was inversely related to processing speed. Associations remained significant in multivariate analyses controlling for age, income, and infarcts. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated cerebral blood flow and oxygen extraction fraction, markers of hemodynamic impairment, are associated with deficits in executive function in individuals with sickle cell anemia.

Unfortunately, myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia development have been higher than expected after graft rejection following nonmyeloablative conditioning and lentivirus-based gene therapy employing myeloablative busulfan for SCD. Somatic mutations discovered in 2 of 76 patients who rejected their grafts were identified at baseline at much lower levels. While a whole-genome sequencing analysis reported no difference between patients with SCD and controls, a study including whole-exome sequencing revealed a higher prevalence of clonal hematopoiesis in individuals with SCD compared with controls. Genetic risk factors for myeloid malignancy development after curative therapy for SCD are currently being explored. Once discovered, decisions could be made about whether gene therapy may be feasible vs allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant, which results in full donor chimerism. In the meantime, care should be taken to perform a benefit/risk assessment to help patients identify the best curative approach for them. Long-term follow-up is necessary to monitor for myeloid malignancies and other adverse effects of curative therapies for SCD.
33631786		Ineffective erythropoiesis in sickle cell disease: new insights and future implications.PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a hemolytic anemia caused by a point mutation in the beta globin gene leading to the expression of an abnormal hemoglobin (HbS) that polymerizes under hypoxic conditions driving red cell sickling. Circulating red cells have been extensively characterized in SCD, as their destruction and removal from peripheral blood are the major contributors to anemia. However, few reports showed cellular abnormalities during erythropoiesis in SCD, suggesting that anemia could also be influenced by defects of central origin. RECENT FINDINGS: El Hoss et al. demonstrated ineffective erythropoiesis (IE) in SCD and deciphered the molecular mechanism underlying cell death during the hemoglobin synthesis phase of terminal differentiation. They showed that HbS polymerization induces apoptosis of differentiating erythroblasts and that fetal hemoglobin rescues these cells through its antipolymerization function. SUMMARY: IE is the major cause of anemia in beta-thalassemia patients, and it is generally surmised that it contributes little to anemia of SCD. Recent reports demonstrate the occurrence of IE in SCD patients and show important alterations in the hematopoietic and erythroid niches, both in SCD patients and in the humanized Townes SCD mouse model. This implies that therapeutic strategies initially designed to improve red cell survival in the circulation of SCD patients would also positively impact erythropoiesis and bone marrow cellularity.
37083638		Adolescents and Young Adults with Sickle Cell Disease: Nociplastic Pain and Pain Catastrophizing as Predictors of Pain Interference and Opioid Consumption.OBJECTIVES: Some patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) have features of nociplastic pain. While research suggests that many patients with nociplastic pain consume more opioids due to opioid non-responsiveness, little is known about the impact of nociplastic pain and pain catastrophizing on opioid consumption and pain interference among adolescents and young adults (AYA) with SCD. The purpose of this study was to (1) characterize nociplastic pain and pain catastrophizing among AYA with SCD, and (2) determine whether these characterizations are associated with subsequent opioid consumption and pain interference one-month after characterization. METHODS: Participants completed surveys characterizing nociplastic pain and catastrophizing at a routine clinic visit (baseline). Thereafter, participants received weekly text messages which included pain interference and opioid consumption surveys. Multi-predictor two-part models were used to evaluate the predictive relationships between baseline characterizations and subsequent pain interference, and opioid consumption. RESULTS: Forty-eight AYA aged 14-35 completed baseline measures. Twenty-five percent of participants had scores suggestive of nociplastic pain. Greater nociplastic pain features significantly increased the odds of consuming opioids (OR 1.2) and having greater interference from pain (OR 1.46). Regression analyses found that greater baseline nociplastic pain characteristics were significantly associated with opioid consumption (beta 0.13) and pain interference (beta 0.061); whereas higher pain catastrophizing scores predicted less opioid consumption (beta -0.03) and less pain interference (beta -0.0007). DISCUSSION: In this sample of AYA with SCD, features of nociplastic pain predicted higher subsequent opioid consumption and pain interference. Being aware of nociplastic pain features in patients with SCD may better guide individualized pain management.
34843453		Integrating deep learning with microfluidics for biophysical classification of sickle red blood cells adhered to laminin.Sickle cell disease, a genetic disorder affecting a sizeable global demographic, manifests in sickle red blood cells (sRBCs) with altered shape and biomechanics. sRBCs show heightened adhesive interactions with inflamed endothelium, triggering painful vascular occlusion events. Numerous studies employ microfluidic-assay-based monitoring tools to quantify characteristics of adhered sRBCs from high resolution channel images. The current image analysis workflow relies on detailed morphological characterization and cell counting by a specially trained worker. This is time and labor intensive, and prone to user bias artifacts. Here we establish a morphology based classification scheme to identify two naturally arising sRBC subpopulations-deformable and non-deformable sRBCs-utilizing novel visual markers that link to underlying cell biomechanical properties and hold promise for clinically relevant insights. We then set up a standardized, reproducible, and fully automated image analysis workflow designed to carry out this classification. This relies on a two part deep neural network architecture that works in tandem for segmentation of channel images and classification of adhered cells into subtypes. Network training utilized an extensive data set of images generated by the SCD BioChip, a microfluidic assay which injects clinical whole blood samples into protein-functionalized microchannels, mimicking physiological conditions in the microvasculature. Here we carried out the assay with the sub-endothelial protein laminin. The machine learning approach segmented the resulting channel images with 99.1+-0.3% mean IoU on the validation set across 5 k-folds, classified detected sRBCs with 96.0+-0.3% mean accuracy on the validation set across 5 k-folds, and matched trained personnel in overall characterization of whole channel images with R2 = 0.992, 0.987 and 0.834 for total, deformable and non-deformable sRBC counts respectively. Average analysis time per channel image was also improved by two orders of magnitude (~ 2 minutes vs ~ 2-3 hours) over manual characterization. Finally, the network results show an order of magnitude less variance in counts on repeat trials than humans. This kind of standardization is a prerequisite for the viability of any diagnostic technology, making our system suitable for affordable and high throughput disease monitoring.

Many studies have reported AHSP as a potential biomarker of various diseases. AHSP gene expression has been studied in detail, but little is known about AHSP protein levels in RBCs. We investigated the AHSP concentration of RBC lysates from control subjects (n = 10) and patients with sickle cell anaemia (SCA) with (n = 10) and without (n = 12) hydroxycarbamide (HC) treatment, to evaluate the clinical relevance of AHSP in SCA. We developed a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method, with which we were able, for the first time, to determine the mean AHSP concentration in control RBC lysates (0 82 microg/ml). The AHSP concentration (2 23 microg/ml) was significantly higher in untreated patients with the SS genotype than in controls. The AHSP concentration decreased significantly on HC treatment (1 50 microg/ml) but remained significantly higher than that in controls. A strong positive correlation was observed between the AHSP concentration and the alpha-haemoglobin pool with the three groups of subjects pooled into a single group. Our present findings indicate that AHSP concentration can be considered a candidate biomarker for monitoring HC responses in patients with SCA and suggest a role for AHSP in various RBC diseases.

A total of 101 participants were randomly allocated to low-dose (n = 49) and moderate-dose (n = 52) hydroxyurea treatment groups. The median participant follow-up was 1.6 years (interquartile range, 1.0-2.3), with a planned minimum follow-up of 3.0 years. A total of 6 recurrent strokes and 2 deaths vs 5 recurrent strokes and 3 deaths occurred in the low- and moderate-dose groups, respectively. The incidence rate ratio (IRR) of the primary outcome measure of stroke or death in the low- and moderate-dose hydroxyurea treatment groups was 0.98 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.32-3.00; P = .97). The trial was stopped early owing to no clinical difference in the incidence rates of the primary outcome measure. The incidence rates of recurrent strokes were 7.1 and 6.0 per 100 person-years in the low- and moderate-dose groups, respectively, (IRR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.30-4.88; P = .74). As a measure of adherence to the oral hydroxyurea therapy, the median percent of returned pills was 3.0% and 2.6% in the low- and moderate-dose groups, respectively. No participant had hydroxyurea therapy stopped for myelosuppression. For children with SCA in low-income settings without access to regular blood transfusion therapy, initial low-dose hydroxyurea is a minimum known efficacious dose for secondary stroke prevention.

35811388	treat|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell	Ten-year longitudinal analysis of hydroxyurea implementation in a pediatric sickle cell program.Hydroxyurea (HU) has proven benefit in sickle cell anemia (SCA), but HU is still underutilized. The Pediatric Sickle Cell Program of Northern Virginia prescribes HU regardless of symptoms to all SCA patients age >= 9 months and prospectively tracks outcomes. HU is dosed to maximum tolerated dosing (MTD), targeting 30% Hgb F. Longitudinal data from 2009 to 2019 encompassing 1222 HU-eligible and 950 HU-exposure patient-years were analyzed in 2-year intervals for hemoglobin (Hgb), fetal hemoglobin (Hgb F), hospitalizations, transfusions, and treat-and-release ED visits. Comparing HU-eligible patients in the interval prior to HU implementation (2009-2011) to the last interval analyzed after HU implementation (2017-2019), HU usage increased from 33% to 93%, average Hgb increased from 8.3 +- 0.98 to 9.8 +- 1.3 g/dl (p < .0001), average Hgb F rose from 13 +- 8.7% to 26 +- 9.9% (p < .0001), hospitalizations decreased from 0.71 (95% CI 0.54-0.91) to 0.2 (95% CI 0.13-0.28) admissions/person-year, sporadic transfusions decreased from 0.4 (95% CI 0.27-0.55) to 0.05 (95% CI 0.02-0.12) transfusions/person-year. Treat-and-release ED visit rates remained unchanged, varying between 0.49 (95% CI 0.36-0.64) and 0.64 (95% CI 0.48-0.83) visits/person-year. By the last interval, 72% of patients had Hgb >= 9 g/dl, 42% had Hgb F >= 30%, 79% experienced no hospitalizations, and 94% received no transfusions. Uniform HU prescription for SCA patients with close monitoring to achieve high Hgb F resulted in significant improvements in laboratory and clinical outcomes within 2 years, which continued to improve over the next 6 years. Rigorous HU implementation in a pediatric sickle cell population is feasible, effective, and sustainable.

Fifty patients diagnosed with SCA and followed up in the hematology outpatient clinic were evaluated in the urology outpatient clinic as the study group. In addition, there were 88 patients without any SCA-related complaints in the control group. We compared these groups with respect to their values, spermiogram parameters, testicular volume, and SWE values. Among patients in the SCA group, 28% had impaired sperm parameters. When testicular elastography was assessed, the testicular volumes were materially lower in the SCA group in comparison to the control group [right testicular volume: 14.76 (12.77-18.12) and 19.68 (15.12-24.18), respectively, p < 0.001; left testicular volume: 14.11 (11.06-17.32) and 16.59 (13.38-20.13), respectively, p = 0.015]. Additionally, the left testis central stiffness and the left testis inferior stiffness were significantly higher in the SCA group (p < 0.001 and p = 0.014, respectively). The age and hydroxyurea use had a worse effect on sperm parameters in patients with SCA (odds ratio: -0.161 and -1.914, standard deviation: 0.071 and 0.921, and p = 0.024 and p = 0.038, respectively). We consider that the technique utilized in this study for SWE values is fast and can be adopted as a reliable diagnostic tool and follow-up practice in routine clinical practice to evaluate the acuteness of damage to the testicles in patients having SCA.
35068085		Benefit of pulmonary subspecialty care for children with sickle cell disease and asthma.OBJECTIVE: Asthma is a recognized comorbidity in children with sickle cell disease (SCD). It increases the risk of acute chest syndrome (ACS), vaso-occlusive episodes, and early mortality. We aim to determine whether evaluation and management of children with SCD and asthma by a pulmonologist reduce rate of asthma exacerbation and ACS. METHODS: The study included 192 patients with SCD (0-21 years) followed at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Hematology between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2018, with a diagnosis of asthma, wheeze, or cough. Patients were placed in two groups: those evaluated by a pulmonologist (SCD-A-P) and those not (SCD-A). Rates of emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations for asthma exacerbation and ACS were compared between groups and over time. RESULTS: SCD-A-P patients (n = 70) were predominantly SCD type SS with lower hemoglobin and hematocrit compared to SCD-A patients (n = 122). SCD-A-P started with a higher average rate of hospital visits for asthma exacerbation and ACS per year (2.69 [1.02-4.37]) compared to SCD-A (0.43 [0.24-0.63]), (p < 0.001). For SCD-A-P patients with at least one hospital visit (n = 48), the average rate decreased from 3.93 (1.57-6.29) to 0.85 (0.48-1.23) following pulmonary consultation (p = 0.014) and was comparable to the SCD-A rate by study end. CONCLUSION: SCD-A-P was mainly SCD type SS and had higher ED/hospitalization rates for asthma exacerbation and ACS compared to SCD-A, but the rates significantly decreased following pulmonology consultation. These findings support the pulmonologist's role in the multidisciplinary care of SCD patients and highlight the need for evidence-based asthma guidelines for children with SCD.
37956414		Digital PCR to Measure SARS-CoV-2 RNA, Variants, and Outcomes in Youth.BACKGROUND: The role of SARS-CoV-2 viral load in predicting contagiousness, disease severity, transmissibility, and clinical decision-making continues to be an area of great interest. However, most studies have been in adults and have evaluated SARS-CoV-2 loads using cycle thresholds (Ct) values, which are not standardized preventing consistent interpretation critical to understanding clinical impact and utility. Here, a quantitative SARS-CoV-2 reverse-transcription digital PCR (RT-dPCR) assay normalized to WHO International Units was applied to children at risk of severe disease diagnosed with COVID-19 at St Jude Children's Research Hospital between March 28, 2020, and January 31, 2022. METHODS: Demographic and clinical information from children, adolescents and young adults treated at St Jude Children's Research Hospital were abstracted from medical records. Respiratory samples underwent SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantitation by RT-dPCR targeting N1 and N2 genes, with sequencing to determine the genetic lineage of infecting virus. RESULTS: Four hundred and sixty-two patients aged 0-24 years (median 11 years old) were included during the study period. Most patients were infected by the omicron variant (43.72%), followed by ancestral strain (22.29%), delta (13.20%) and alpha (2.16%). Viral load at presentation ranged from 2.49 to 9.14 log10 IU/ml, and higher viral RNA loads were associated with symptoms (OR 1.32: CI95% 1.16-1.49) and respiratory disease (OR 1.23: CI95% 1.07-1.41). Viral load did not differ by SARS-CoV-2 variant, vaccination status, age, or baseline diagnosis. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 RNA loads predict the presence of symptomatic and respiratory diseases. The use of standardized, quantitative methods is feasible, allows for replication, comparisons across institutions, and has the potential to facilitate consensus quantitative thresholds for risk stratification and treatment.

In the present retrospective study, we compared serum samples from transfusion-dependent patients with beta-thalassaemia major and intermedia, hereditary spherocytosis and sickle cell disease (SCD). Haemolysis, transfusions and ineffective erythropoiesis contribute to haem and iron overload in haemolytic patients. In all cohorts we observed increased systemic haem and iron levels associated with scavenger depletion and toxic 'free' species formation. Endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress and inflammation markers were significantly increased compared to healthy donors. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, oxidative stress markers remained significantly associated with both haem- and iron-related parameters, while soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (sVCAM-1), soluble endothelial selectin (sE-selectin) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) showed the strongest association with haem-related parameters and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (sICAM-1), sVCAM-1, interleukin 6 (IL-6) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) with iron-related parameters. While hereditary spherocytosis was associated with the highest IL-6 and TNFalpha levels, beta-thalassaemia major showed limited inflammation compared to SCD. The sVCAM1 increase was significantly lower in patients with SCD receiving exchange compared to simple transfusions. The present results support the involvement of free haem/iron species in the pathogenesis of vascular dysfunction and sterile inflammation in haemolytic diseases, irrespective of the underlying haemolytic mechanism, and highlight the potential therapeutic benefit of iron/haem scavenging therapies in these conditions.
36400545		Allogeneic Transplant and Gene Therapy: Evolving Toward a Cure.Curative therapies for sickle cell disease (SCD) include allogeneic human leukocyte antigen (HLA)- matched sibling and haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT), gene therapy, and gene editing. However, comparative trial data that might facilitate selecting one curative therapy over another are unavailable. New strategies to decrease graft rejection and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) risks are needed to expand haploidentical HCT. Myeloablative gene therapy and gene editing also has limitations. Herein, we review recent studies on curative therapies for SCD in the past 5 years.
38477912		Consequence of RBC Deformability On Heat Sink Effect of Blood in a Three Dimensional Bifurcated Vessel.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to analyze the effect of RBC shape and deformation on blood heat transfer of a tumor patient suffering from blood disorders when being treated with hyperthermia procedure. METHODS: Euler-Euler multiphase method along with granular model is used in this study to simulate blood flow in a bifurcated vessel. Kinetic theory is used to include particle nature of RBCs during blood flow in the current model. RESULTS: An increase of 0.25 K in blood temperature is noticed during a cardiac cycle for diseased patient compared to normal patient. These results indicate that blood disorders can alter the heat sink effect and blood heat transfer in a bifurcated vessel, which also affects the efficacy and efficiency of tumor treatment procedure. Hence, blood disorder (where the morphology of RBC is altered) of a patient needs to be taken into consideration when thermal therapy is being used for tumor treatment. CONCLUSION: Both spatial and transient Nusselt number of a normal patient is higher compared to a blood diseased patient which indicates a higher heat transfer in case of normal patient compared to the later, when treated with similar ablation procedure. So for a tumor patient suffering from blood disorder, modification in hyperthermia procedure needs to be done compared to a normal patient for complete infected cell necrosis and minimal destruction of healthy tissues.
36935257		The sick(le) brain and spine: neuroimaging findings in paediatric patients with sickle cell disease.Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an autosomal recessive haemoglobinopathy, which manifests as multisystem ischaemia and infarction, as well as haemolytic anaemia. The morphological changes of red blood cells (RBCs) that promote ischaemia/infarction as the main multi-systemic manifestation, with associated vasculopathy, may also lead to haemorrhage and fat embolisation. Bone infarctions, whether of the skull or spine, are relatively common with subsequent increased infectious susceptibility. We present a broad spectrum of brain and spine imaging findings of SCD from a level III paediatric hospital in Lisbon, between 2010 and 2022. Our aim is to highlight brain and spine imaging findings from a serial review of multiple patients with SCD and respective neuroimaging characterisation.
36992422	associate|@DISEASE_beta_Thalassemia|@GENE_HBB ;associate|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell|@GENE_HBB	Gene Therapy for beta-Hemoglobinopathies: From Discovery to Clinical Trials.Investigations to understand the function and control of the globin genes have led to some of the most exciting molecular discoveries and biomedical breakthroughs of the 20th and 21st centuries. Extensive characterization of the globin gene locus, accompanied by pioneering work on the utilization of viruses as human gene delivery tools in human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HPSCs), has led to transformative and successful therapies via autologous hematopoietic stem-cell transplant with gene therapy (HSCT-GT). Due to the advanced understanding of the beta-globin gene cluster, the first diseases considered for autologous HSCT-GT were two prevalent beta-hemoglobinopathies: sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia, both affecting functional beta-globin chains and leading to substantial morbidity. Both conditions are suitable for allogeneic HSCT; however, this therapy comes with serious risks and is most effective using an HLA-matched family donor (which is not available for most patients) to obtain optimal therapeutic and safe benefits. Transplants from unrelated or haplo-identical donors carry higher risks, although they are progressively improving. Conversely, HSCT-GT utilizes the patient's own HSPCs, broadening access to more patients. Several gene therapy clinical trials have been reported to have achieved significant disease improvement, and more are underway. Based on the safety and the therapeutic success of autologous HSCT-GT, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2022 approved an HSCT-GT for beta-thalassemia (Zynteglo ). This review illuminates the beta-globin gene research journey, adversities faced, and achievements reached; it highlights important molecular and genetic findings of the beta-globin locus, describes the predominant globin vectors, and concludes by describing promising results from clinical trials for both sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia.
34002408		Screening for new red blood cell alloantibodies after transfusion in patients with sickle cell disease.BACKGROUND: Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) are frequent recipients of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions and are at risk for RBC alloimmunization. RBC alloimmunization is diagnosed by identifying RBC alloantibodies as part of pre-transfusion testing, but this testing fails to detect alloantibodies that have evanesced. It may be beneficial to screen for new RBC alloantibody development after transfusion before possible antibody evanescence. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Our institution started a new initiative for episodically transfused patients with SCD to obtain at least one antibody screen 2-6 months after transfusion as part of their clinical care. A database was created to prospectively track all transfused patients for 1 year and their post-transfusion antibody screen results. Patients received prophylactically CEK-matched RBC units. RESULTS: During the study year, 138 patients with SCD received a total of 242 RBC transfusions. Patients with a history of an RBC alloantibody (n = 13, 9.4%) had previously received more RBC units than non alloimmunized patients (median 11 vs. 2 RBC units, p = .0002). A total of 337 post-transfusion antibody screens were obtained in 127 patients (92.0%) with 110 patients (79.7%) having at least one antibody screen 2-6 months post-transfusion. With this prospective testing, two new RBC alloantibodies (anti-C and -M) were identified in two patients. CONCLUSION: It is feasible to test for new RBC alloantibody development in most episodically transfused patients with SCD as part of their routine care. The yield of this screening appears low with CEK matching, but it could still provide important information for individual patients.
37039215		Impact of COVID-19 infection among indian sickle cell disease patients.Background: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the most common hemoglobinopathy disorders and is widely prevalent in India, especially in the tribal population. SCD patients are prone to develop recurrent respiratory infections and related complications owing to the microvascular occlusion and impaired immunological response. Objectives: We aimed to determine the prevalence and impact of COVID-19 in SCD patients from India. Methodology: We conducted a cross-sectional study in Chandrapur district of Maharashtra, India, between August and October 2021. After taking informed consent, details of 300 SCD patients' demographic data, history of COVID-19 testing, infection, symptoms related to COVID-19 in the past 1 year, hospitalization, complications, mortality, COVID-19 vaccination, and side effects were recorded. Results: We found that 93 (31%) of SCD patients had influenza-like symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic with symptoms of fever (81.72%), cough (35.48%), sore throat (18.27%), headache (15.05%), and breathlessness (7.52%). A total of 13 (4.33%) SCD among 300 SCD were tested as COVID positive. Majority of them were mild cases and the 1st dose of COVID-19 vaccine was received by 47 (29.37%) of SCD patients and 10 (6.02%) of the patient had received second dose of vaccine. Conclusion: Low incidence of COVID-19 and milder disease spectrum in our study cohort suggests that there is no increased risk of COVID-19 mortality and morbidity in SCD patients compared to general population. However, the reason for low COVID vaccination in our study could be due to the fear of complications of COVID vaccine.

Limited access to magnetic resonance imaging and angiography (MRI-MRA) in sub-Saharan Africa impedes detection of clinically unapparent cerebrovascular injury. Blood-based brain biomarkers of cerebral infarcts have been identified in non-SCA adults. Using plasma samples from a well-characterized cross-sectional sample of Ugandan children with SCA, we explored relationships between biomarker levels and MRI-detected cerebral infarcts and transcranial Doppler (TCD) arterial velocity. Testing was performed using a 4-plex panel of brain injury biomarkers, including neurofilament light chain (NfL), a central nervous system neuron-specific protein. Mean biomarker levels from the SCA group (n = 81) were similar to those from non-SCA sibling controls (n = 54). Within the SCA group, NfL levels were significantly higher in those with MRI-detected infarcts compared to no infarcts, and higher with elevated TCD velocity versus normal velocity. Elevated NfL remained strongly associated with MRI-detected infarcts after adjusting for sex and age. All non-SCA controls and SCA participants lacking MRI-detected infarcts had low NfL levels. These data suggest potential utility of plasma-based NfL levels to identify children with SCA cerebrovascular injury. Replication and prospective studies are needed to confirm these novel findings and the clinical utility of NfL versus MRI imaging.
34981707		Liver Transplant in Hemoglobin SC Disease and Autoimmune Hepatitis: A Case Report.Although liver transplant is a life-saving measure for individuals with end-stage liver disease, the perioperative management may be challenging in individuals with concomitant sickle cell disease. We report a case of a 50-year-old man with sickle cell disease genotype SC (HbSC) and cirrhosis secondary to autoimmune hepatitis who underwent liver transplant. His postoperative course included upper extremity deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, stroke via a patent foramen ovale after a line removal, and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. Fortunately, he is alive with a functioning graft at 10 months after liver transplant. This case highlights the feasibility of liver transplant in sickle cell disease given the support of meticulous multidisciplinary care and the unique aspects of autoimmune hepatitis and sickle cell disease for liver transplant consideration.
33836889		A Qualitative Analysis of State Medicaid Coverage Benefits for Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (alloHCT) for Patients with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD).Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common inherited hemoglobin disorder, affecting approximately 100,000 people in the United States. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT), also known as bone marrow transplant (BMT), is currently the only established curative option for SCD. However, alloHCT is an optional benefit under Medicaid. This study of alloHCT coverage for patients with SCD aims to understand the scope of state Medicaid coverage benefits and BMT financial coordinators' experience working with their state Medicaid programs. States estimated to have more than 50 newborns diagnosed with SCD in 2016 and at least one active BMT Clinical Trials Network (1503 [STRIDE 2], NCT02766465) transplant center (TC) were eligible to participate in this study. Qualitative, semi-structured interviews 30 to 60 minutes in length were conducted with BMT financial coordinators via telephone between May and October 2019. A total of 10 BMT financial coordinators from 10 TCs representing eight states (Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Michigan, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Virginia) participated in the semi-structured interviews. Coordinators in all of the included states reported that alloHCT in children with SCD with a human leukocyte antigen-matched sibling donor was covered by their state Medicaid programs. However, only two states (Florida and Texas) had legislative policies mandating coverage of routine medical costs for patients in clinical trials. TCs in two states (Illinois and Pennsylvania) reported accepting out-of-state Medicaid insurance, but only one state (Michigan) covered both travel and lodging for the patient and one caregiver. Four themes emerged when coordinators were asked about their perspectives and experiences working with their corresponding state Medicaid programs: (1) state Medicaid eligibility criteria based on disability were perceived as being restrictive, and Medicaid reimbursement rates were reported to be low; (2) Medicaid fee-for-service plans were perceived as being more comprehensive and easier to navigate compared to comprehensive managed care (CMC) plans; (3) there is a need to address caregiver and financial assistance beyond the health care costs; and (4) completing the insurance authorization process leading up to alloHCT is critical, including peer-to-peer reviews. There is limited legislative policy to help ensure access to clinical trials and provide out-of-state benefits and travel and lodging for Medicaid enrollees with SCD. These data provide insight into potential areas that could influence changes in policy to enhance access to curative therapy for SCD.
34343995	associate|@CHEMICAL_Creatinine|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell	Sickle Cell Disease and the Kidney: Pathophysiology and Novel Biomarkers.Clinical Background: Renal involvement in sickle cell disease (SCD), called sickle cell nephropathy (SCN), includes several renal manifestations, such as renal acidification defect, distal nephron dysfunction, renal papillary necrosis, and proteinuria related to glomerular injury, leading to end-stage renal disease. Epidemiology: Many patients with SCD have a defect in urinary concentration, a problem caused by the destruction of the renal medulla that initiates in childhood. The presence of proteinuria in SCD is age-related and starts as microalbuminuria in adolescence and progresses to macroalbuminuria. Proteinuria is responsible for the progression to chronic kidney disease in some patients with SCD with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decreased due to interactions between various processes involving the vascular, glomerular, tubular, and interstitial compartments of the kidney. Challenges: Renal complications are hardly identifiable in the early stages, as serum creatinine increases only in the final stages of SCN. Subnormal GFR and elevated serum creatinine levels develop only when there is significant proteinuria. Prevention and Treatment: The identification of biomarkers of early, non-invasive kidney injury, and their inclusion in clinical practice will contribute to the identification of the mechanisms involved in the development of renal syndromes, facilitating the development of more effective strategies in the prevention and treatment of SCD.
35400264		Strategies to increase access to basic sickle cell disease care in low- and middle-income countries.INTRODUCTION: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common hemoglobinopathy in the world. Over 90% of those born with SCD live in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), yet individuals in these settings have much poorer outcomes compared to those in high-income countries. AREAS COVERED: This manuscript provides an in-depth review of the cornerstones of basic SCD care, the barriers to implementing these in LMICs, and strategies to increase access in these regions. Publications in English language, peer-reviewed, and edited from 2000 to 2021 were identified on PubMed. Google search was used for gray literature. EXPERT OPINION: Outcomes for patients with SCD in high-income countries have improved over the last few decades due to the implementation of universal newborn screening programs and use of routine antimicrobial prophylaxis, increase in therapeutic and curative options, and the adoption of specific measures to decrease risk of stroke. This success has not translated to LMICs due to several reasons including resource constraints. A combination of several strategies is needed to increase access to basic SCD care for patients in these settings.

35696755		The association between sleep disturbances and neurocognitive function in pediatric sickle cell disease.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Youth with sickle cell disease (SCD) without neurological complications continue to be at increased risk of neurocognitive difficulties. Nocturnal hypoxemia is associated with neurocognitive outcomes and has been identified as a chronic complication in youth with SCD. The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between sleep disturbances and neurocognitive functioning in youth with SCD, while taking into account demographic and socioeconomic factors. METHODS: Youth with SCD were identified through retrospective chart review who underwent a standardized polysomnography (PSG) and completed a neuropsychological testing battery to assess cognitive skills, including verbal comprehension, working memory, processing speed, and cognitive flexibility. Questionnaires were also collected to assess parent-reported concerns with their youth's executive and adaptive skills. RESULTS: Twenty-seven youth with SCD, ages 6-17, were identified who completed both a PSG and neuropsychological testing. Results demonstrated that verbal comprehension decreased by 2.37 standard points for every unit decrease in mean nocturnal oxygen saturation (SpO2) (p = 0.031). Working memory was also found to decrease by 1.46 standard points for each 1% increase in time spent under 90% oxygen saturation (pTST SpO2 < 90%) (p = 0.030). Sleep parameters did not significantly predict other cognitive scores or parent-reported executive or behavioral ratings. CONCLUSION: Our study found that sleep disturbance, mean nocturnal SpO2 and pTST SpO2 < 90%, significantly affected verbal comprehension and working memory performance, respectively. Overall, these findings have the potential to identify sleep needs in youth with SCD to promote sleep-targeted interventions as a modifiable factor to reduce neurocognitive deficits.
34042406		Towards manufactured red blood cells for the treatment of inherited anemia.Patients with inherited anemia and hemoglobinopathies (such as sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia) are treated with red blood cell (RBC) transfusions to alleviate their symptoms. Some of these patients may have rare blood group types or go on to develop alloimmune reactions, which can make it difficult to source compatible blood in the donor population. Laboratory-grown RBC represent a particularly attractive alternative which could satisfy an unmet clinical need. The challenge, however, is to produce - from a limited number of stem cells - the 2x1012 RBC required for a standard adult therapeutic dose. Encouraging progress has been made in RBC production from adult stem cells under good manufacturing practice. In 2011, the Douay group conducted a successful proof-of-principle mini-transfusion of autologous manufactured RBC in a single volunteer. In the UK, a trial is planned to assess whether manufactured RBC are equivalent to RBC produced naturally in donors, by testing an allogeneic mini-dose of laboratory-grown manufactured RBC in multiple volunteers. This review discusses recent progress in the erythroid culture field as well as opportunities for further scaling up of manufactured RBC production for transfusion practice.

36472656		Glomerular hyperfiltration: part 2-clinical significance in children.Glomerular hyperfiltration (GHF) is a phenomenon that can occur in various clinical conditions affecting the kidneys such as sickle cell disease, diabetes mellitus, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, and solitary functioning kidney. Yet, the pathophysiological mechanisms vary from one disease to another and are not well understood. More so, it has been demonstrated that GHF may occur at the single-nephron in some clinical conditions while in others at the whole-kidney level. In this review, we explore the pathophysiological mechanisms of GHF in relation to various clinical conditions in the pediatric population. In addition, we discuss the role and mechanism of action of important factors such as gender, low birth weight, and race in the pathogenesis of GHF. Finally, in this current review, we further highlight the consequences of GHF in the progression of kidney disease.
36120980		Rates of Opioid Misuse Amongst Patients Receiving Pain Management for Sickle Cell Disease in An Urban Setting.Background and Objective: Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is known to cause acute severe pain episodes known as vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) mainly treated with opioid analgesics. Since the opioid epidemic there is an interest in determining the opioid misuse potential in these patients. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to determine the rates of opioid misuse among patients with SCD by assessing the rate of unexpected drug screening results in a sickle cell disease clinic. Methods: This was a retrospective chart review study conducted at the outpatient sickle cell disease clinic. The primary independent variables were the prescribed opioid medications while the primary dependent variable was the collected opioid metabolite. Descriptive statistics, linear regression and multivariate logistic regression analysis were conducted using SPSS version 24. Results: A total of 100 participants were recruited from July 1, 2018, to June 30, 2020 with 71 included in the analysis. The total mean of morphine milligram equivalents (MME) for all participants was 71.1+-104.9 with 71% of participants having a daily calculated MME of <90MME. The odds of misusing an opioid were 6.72 times higher (P<.02) if a participant used marijuana compared to a participant who didn't. In addition, the odds of misusing an opioid were 2.47 times higher (P<.04) if the patient was prescribed an opioid daily dose greater than 90 MME as opposed to a daily dose less than 90 MME. Conclusion: Participants who consumed greater than 90 MME's per day and utilized marijuana were more likely to misuse opioids.
33740499		Classification of red blood cell aggregation using empirical wavelet transform analysis of ultrasonic radiofrequency echo signals.Grading red blood cell (RBC) aggregation is important for the early diagnosis and prevention of related diseases such as ischemic cardio-cerebrovascular disease, type II diabetes, deep vein thrombosis, and sickle cell disease. In this study, a machine learning technique based on an adaptive analysis of ultrasonic radiofrequency (RF) echo signals in blood is proposed, and its feasibility for classifying RBC aggregation is explored. Using an adaptive empirical wavelet transform (EWT) analysis, the ultrasonic RF signals are decomposed into a series of empirical mode functions (EMFs); then, dominant empirical mode functions (DEMFs) are selected from the series. Six statistical characteristics, including the mean, variance, median, kurtosis, root mean square (RMS), and skewness are calculated for the locally normalized DEMFs, aiming to form primary feature vectors. Random forest (RDF) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers are trained with the given feature vectors to obtain prediction models for RBC classification. Ultrasonic RF echo signals are acquired from five groups of six types of porcine blood samples with average numbers of aggregated RBCs of 1.04, 1.20, 1.83, 2.31, 2.72, and 4.28, respectively, to test the classification performance of the proposed method. The best subset with regard to the variance, kurtosis, and RMS is determined according to the maximum accuracy based on the RDF and SVM classifiers. The classification accuracies are 84.03 +- 3.13% for the RDF classifier, and 85.88 +- 2.99% for the SVM classifier. The mean classification accuracy of the SVM classifier is 1.85% better than that of the RDF classifier. In conclusion, the machine learning method is useful for the discrimination of varying degrees of RBC aggregation, and has potential for use in characterizing and monitoring the RBC aggregation in vessels.

37651253		Brucellosis in a Sickle Cell Patient with Hyposplenia.Sickle cell disease patients are prone to infection and overwhelming sepsis because an immunedeficient state arises from asplenia (autosplenectomy/surgical splenectomy) and functional hyposplenism. The common pathogen encountered in sepsis with asplenic/hyposplenism patients is encapsulated organism, gram-negative bacilli, but in developing countries like India, there are many possibilities of infection by an uncommon organism that make it difficult to diagnose. Here, we have described a case of sickle cell disease presented with persistent fever and later, found to have an atrophic spleen with involvement of respiratory system and osteoarticular system. After extensive workup, he was diagnosed to be brucellosis. So, unusual infectious causes be kept as a differential diagnosis in a susceptible host while dealing with persistent symptoms. Uncommon infections like Brucella need to be studied in hyposplenism patients as data are lacking.
37219613		Widefield oct-angiography-based classification of sickle cell retinopathy.PURPOSE: To assess the capillary non-perfusion in different concentric sectors on widefield optical coherence tomography angiography (WF-OCTA) and to correlate the ratio of non-perfusion (RNP) to the severity of sickle cell retinopathy (SCR). METHODS: This retrospective, cross-sectional study included eyes of patients with various sickle cell disease (SCD) genotypes having undergone WF-OCTA and ultra-widefield color fundus photography (UWF-CFP). Eyes were grouped as no SCR, non-proliferative SCR or proliferative SCR. RNP was assessed on WF-OCTA montage in different field-of-view (FOV) sectors centered on the fovea: 0-10-degrees circle excluding the foveal avascular zone, the 10-30-degrees circle excluding the optic nerve, the 30-60-degrees circle, and the full 60-degrees circle. RESULTS: Forty-two eyes of twenty-eight patients were included. Within each SCR group, mean RNP of the FOV 30-60 sector was higher than all other sectors (p < 0.05). Mean RNP of all sectors were significatively different between no SCR group and proliferative SCR group (p < 0.05). To distinguish no SCR versus non-proliferative SCR FOV 30-60 had a good sensitivity and specificity of 41.67% and 93.33%, respectively (cutoff RNP > 22.72%, AUC = 0.75, 95% CI 0.56-0.94, p = 0.028). To differentiate non-proliferative versus proliferative SCR, FOV 0-10 had good sensitivity and specificity of 33.33% and 91.67%, respectively (cutoff RNP > 18.09, AUC = 0.73, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.93, p = 0.041). To discern no SCR versus proliferative SCR, all sectors had optimal sensitivity and specificity (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: WF OCTA-based RNP provides non-invasive diagnostic information regarding the presence and severity of SCR, and correlates with disease stage in certain FOV sectors.

35973707		Inpatient palliative care use by patients with sickle cell disease: a retrospective cross-sectional study.OBJECTIVE: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a highly morbid condition notable for recurrent hospitalisations due to vaso-occlusive crises and complications of end organ damage. Little is known about the use of inpatient palliative care services in adult patients with SCD. This study aims to evaluate inpatient palliative care use during SCD-related hospitalisations overall and during terminal hospitalisations. We hypothesise that use of palliative care is low in SCD hospitalisations. DESIGN: A retrospective cross-sectional study using data from the National Inpatient Sample from 2008 to 2017 was conducted. SETTING: US hospitals from 47 states and the District of Columbia. PARTICIPANTS: Patients >18 years old hospitalised with a primary or secondary International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) or ICD-10-CM diagnosis of SCD were included. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Palliative care service use (documented by ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes V66.7 and Z51.5). RESULTS: 987 555 SCD-related hospitalisations were identified, of which 4442 (0.45%) received palliative care service. Palliative care service use increased at a rate of 9.2% per year (95% CI 5.6 to 12.9). NH-black and Hispanic patients were 33% and 53% less likely to have palliative care services compared with NH-white patients (OR 0.67; 95% CI 0.45 to 0.99 and OR 0.47; 95% CI 0.26 to 0.84). Female patients (OR 0.40; 95% CI 0.21 to 0.76), Medicaid use (OR 0.40; 95% CI 0.21 to 0.78), rural (OR 0.47; 95% CI 0.28 to 0.79) and urban non-teaching hospitals (OR 0.61; 95% CI 0.47 to 0.80) each had a lower likelihood of palliative care services use. CONCLUSION: Use of palliative care during SCD-related hospitalisations is increasing but remains low. Disparities associated with race and gender exist for use of palliative care services during SCD-related hospitalisation. Further studies are needed to guide evidence-based palliative care interventions for more comprehensive and equitable care of adult patients with SCD.

The significant sequela of SCD include anemia and recurrent vaso-occlusive episodes (VOEs) which may effectuate patients to receive chronic blood transfusions. Current pharmacotherapy options for SCD include hydroxyurea, voxelotor, Lglutamine, and crizanlizumab. Simple and exchange transfusions are often utilized as prophylaxis to prevent emergency department (ED)/urgent care (UC) visits or hospitalizations from VOEs by reducing the level of sickled red blood cells (RBCs). In addition, the treatment of VOEs involves intravenous (IV) hydration and pain management. Studies have demonstrated that sickle cell infusion centers (SCIC) decrease hospital admissions for VOEs, and IV hydration and pain medications are the key components of management employed. Thus, we hypothesized that implementing a structured infusion protocol in the outpatient setting would reduce the incidence of VOEs. METHODS: Here, we discuss two patients with SCD who were trialed on scheduled outpatient IV hydration and opioids with the goal of decreasing the frequency of VOEs in the setting of the current blood product shortage and the patients' refusal to receive exchange transfusions. RESULTS: Overall, the two patients had opposing outcomes- one demonstrated reduced frequency of VOEs, whereas the other had mixed results due to noncompliance to scheduled outpatient sessions. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: The use of outpatient SCICs may be an effective intervention for prevention of VOEs in patients with SCD, and further patient-centered research and quality improvement initiatives are needed to further quantify and understand the factors contributing to their efficacy.
36259419		Spleen size in homozygous sickle cell disease: trends in a birth cohort using ultrasound.OBJECTIVES: To provide ultrasound baselines for spleen length in homozygous sickle cell disease (HbSS) and in normal controls with a HbAA genotype. METHODS: The Jamaican cohort study identified 311 babies with HbSS and 246 matched HbAA controls during the screening of 100,000 consecutive deliveries in Kingston, Jamaica from 1973 to 1981. Ultrasonography commenced in 1988 when the youngest patients were aged 6 years at which time deaths, emigrations and default had reduced the numbers to 206 HbSS and 89 controls. It continued annually until 2000. RESULTS: The spleen was visualized in all HbAA controls but in only 1103/2138 (52%) scans in HbSS. Where available, mean splenic lengths were significantly lower in HbSS (77-103 mm in males, 70-83 mm in females) compared to normal controls (89-101 mm in males, 86-95 mm in females). Assessed by statistical modelling after adjusting for body height, the splenic ratio (splenic length/body height) declined over the age range 12-20 years in HbSS, consistent with progressive splenic fibrosis. Genetic factors known to inhibit sickling, alpha thalassemia and fetal hemoglobin level (HbF) significantly reduced the decline in splenic ratio. Clinical splenomegaly was an insensitive measure of splenic enlargement as only 50% of patients aged 18 years and above with spleens measuring >=150 mm on ultrasonography had palpable spleens. CONCLUSIONS: An age-related decline in splenic length occurred in HbSS and occurred more slowly with genetic factors known to inhibit sickling. The standards provided may be of value in assessing minor degrees of subclinical acute splenic sequestration. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: These are the first standards available for splenic length in HbSS. They may be useful in detecting red cell sequestration, not apparent from clinical splenomegaly and also provide a model for identifying factors inhibiting vaso-occlusion.
34353203		High Systolic Blood Pressure, Anterior Segment Changes and Visual Impairment Independently Predict Sickle Cell Retinopathy.Sickle cell disease is often complicated by retinopathy, which can be proliferative or non proliferative. Proliferative sickle cell retinopathy potentially leads to blindness. There is a paucity of data on sickle cell disease-related retinopathy from Africa, where the disease is most prevalent. We aimed to determine the clinical, ophthalmic, and laboratory predictors of sickle cell retinopathy in an African population. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 262 participants, aged 13 years and above, with sickle cell disease. Demographic and clinical data were collected using a structured questionnaire and standard physical examinations. Vitreo-retinal specialists performed eye examinations on all the participants. Hematological and biochemical assessments were conducted using standard methods. A multivariate stepwise forward logistic regression was performed to determine the predictors of retinopathy. The median age of the participants was 20 years (interquartile range: 17-25 years). Most of the participants had a homozygous Hb S (HBB: c.20A>T) genotype (96.9%), with 3.1% who carried a Hb S/Hb C (HBB: c.19G>A) genotype. The prevalence of non proliferative sickle cell retinopathy was 24.4%. Only 1.9% had proliferative sickle cell retinopathy (PSCR). Elevated systolic blood pressure (BP) [odds ratio (OR): 6.85, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 1.05-44.45, p = 0.059], moderate visual impairment (OR: 5.2, 95% CI: 1.39-19.63, p = 0.015), and anterior segment changes (OR: 2.21, 95% CI: 1.19-4.13, p = 0.012) were independently predictive of retinopathy. This study provides new insight into predictors of retinopathy in sickle cell disease, with implications on early screening and prevention.
34389516		Transition Navigator Intervention Improves Transition Readiness to Adult Care for Youth With Sickle Cell Disease.OBJECTIVE: Adolescents and young adults (AYA) with sickle cell disease (SCD) experience high rates of acute care utilization and increased morbidity. At this high-risk time, they also face the need to transition from pediatric to adult services, which, if poorly coordinated, adds to heightened morbidity and acute care utilization. The study objective was to characterize the feasibility, acceptability, and short-term efficacy of a protocolized transition navigator (TN) intervention in AYA with SCD. METHODS: We developed a protocolized TN intervention that used ecological assessment and motivational interviewing to assess transition readiness, identify goals, and remove barriers to transition, and to provide disease and pain management education and skills to AYAs with SCD. RESULTS: Ninety-three percent (56/60) of enrolled individuals completed the intervention. Participation in the TN program was associated with significant improvement in mean transition readiness scores (3.58-4.15, P < .0001), disease knowledge scale (8.91-10.13, P < .0001), Adolescent Medication Barriers Scale (40.05-35.39, P = .003) and confidence in both disease (22.5-23.96, P = .048) and pain management (25.07-26.61, P = .003) for youth with SCD. CONCLUSION: The TN intervention was acceptable to youth with SCD, feasible to implement at an urban academic medical center, and addressed barriers to transition identified by the youth. Longer-term assessment is needed to determine if the TN intervention improved successful transfer to and retention in adult care.
37939877		Sickle cell disease and pregnancy.Pregnancy is a particularly risky period in the life of patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Physiological changes during pregnancy increase the risk of vaso-occlusive crises (VOC), acute chest syndrome, venous thromboembolic events, and infections. This concerns haemoglobin (Hb) S/C and S/beta+-thalassaemia patients as much than S/S or S/beta0-thalassaemia patients. SCD also increases the risk of obstetrical complications, such as preeclampsia, in utero foetal death, preterm delivery mostly induced, and intrauterine growth restriction. Thus, pregnancy should be planned and closely monitored by a multidisciplinary team involving obstetricians and sickle cell disease specialists. Before pregnancy, the parents should also be informed about the risk of transmission of this autosomal recessive disease, and the father should therefore be prescribed haemoglobin electrophoresis. Treatments have to be revised when planning pregnancy: hydroxyurea (HU) should be stopped as soon as pregnancy is suspected or confirmed. Preventive blood transfusion is not systematic, but is recommended in the case of a pre-existing transfusion program prior to pregnancy, severe pre-existing organ damage, severe obstetric history, and severe or repeated crises during follow-up, especially in patients taking HU before. Despite the risks of prematurity, systematic administration of corticosteroids for foetal lung maturation is not recommended due to the risk of maternal vaso-occlusive event. Although more frequent, due to obstetrical and maternal complications, caesarean section is not systematic, in the absence of maternal contraindications. It is advisable not to exceed the term of 39 weeks of amenorrhoea. Post-partum follow-up is recommended, particularly because of the risk of thromboembolism.

We evaluated the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban, an oral direct factor Xa inhibitor, in subjects with sickle cell anemia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this pilot, single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, eligible subjects with sickle cell anemia received rivaroxaban or placebo. The effect of rivaroxaban on coagulation activation, endothelial activation, inflammation, and microvascular blood flow was evaluated. RESULTS: Fourteen patients (HbSS - 14; females - 9) with mean age of 38 +- 10.6 years were randomized to receive rivaroxaban 20 mg daily or placebo for 4 weeks and, following a 2-week washout phase, were "crossed-over" to the treatment arm opposite to which they were initially assigned. Mean adherence to treatment with rivaroxaban, assessed by pill counts, was 85.6% in the first treatment period and 93.6% in the second period. Treatment with rivaroxaban resulted in a decrease from baseline of thrombin-antithrombin complex versus placebo (-34.4 ug/L [95% CI: -69.4, 0.53] vs. 0.35 ug/L [95% CI: -3.8, 4.5], p = .08), but the difference was not statistically significant. No significant differences were observed in changes from baseline of D-dimer, inflammatory, and endothelial activation markers or measures of microvascular blood flow. Rivaroxaban was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Rivaroxaban was safe but did not significantly decrease coagulation activation, endothelial activation, or inflammation. Rivaroxaban did not improve microvascular blood flow. Adequately powered studies are required to further evaluate the efficacy of rivaroxaban in SCD. Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02072668.

The coexistence of published cases of TTP and sickle cell hemoglobinopathies is rare.Results: Despite the initial treatment with plasma exchange and glucocorticoids, our patient relapsed and also required caplacizumab which resulted in successful remission.Discussion: We conclude by reviewing the cases of TTP in patients with sickle cell hemoglobinopathies and review how vaso-occlusive crises with multiorgan injury can mimic TTP.Conclusion: Ours is the first published case of aTTP with confirmed ADAMTS13 autoantibodies in a patient with a sickle cell hemoglobinopathy and contributes to the literature on the successful use of caplacizumab in clinical practice.
36191299		Subanesthetic ketamine: the way forward for pain management in sickle cell disease patients?INTRODUCTION: Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) present recurrent episodes of acute pain, the hallmark of the disease, and some will also develop chronic pain. Currently, the treatment of SCD acute pain only targets its symptoms, rather than underlying mechanisms, and is directed by expert and consensus guidelines. AREAS COVERED: While opioids remain the mainstay of therapy for acute pain and are also used to treat SCD-related chronic pain, in some patients, opioids are ineffective or are associated with severe undesirable side effects. In those instances, clinicians caring for patients with SCD face an unmet need for effective non-opioid analgesics. Recently, the use of subanesthetic ketamine has been explored as a strategy to meet this need. While definitive evidence of its efficacy is lacking, some information exists suggesting that subanesthetic ketamine improves pain control and may have opioid-sparing effects in SCD-related acute pain. However, ketamine can also yield undesirable psychotomimetic and cardiovascular effects. EXPERT OPINION: After weighing potential risks and benefits, in the absence of better alternatives and in settings where it can be administered safely, ketamine may be a reasonable option for patients with SCD-related acute refractory pain.
35775350	treat|@CHEMICAL_Phenylephrine|@DISEASE_Acute_Disease	Platelet volume parameters as a tool in the evaluation of acute ischemic priapism in patients with sickle cell anemia.OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the predictive value of platelet volume indices (PVIs), such as mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet distribution width (PDW), and plateletcrit (PCT), as prognostic parameters of detumescence in acute ischemic priapism (IP) patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA) in steady-state who received intracavernosal injections of phenylephrine with aspiration and saline irrigation. METHODS: Fifty-six SCA patients with acute IP and 54 healthy male control subjects were included in the research. Priapism was diagnosed by penile Doppler ultrasound and corporal blood gas tests before intervention. Measurements of PVIs (MPV, PDW, and PCT) and TLC were ordered for all participants. Additionally, the duration of priapism was recorded. The area under the curves was calculated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) regression analysis. RESULTS: The detumescence rate was 71.4% after the intervention. Compared to the control group, priapic SCA patients showed significantly higher PLT (p = 0.011), MPV (p = 0.002), PDW (p = 0.032), PCT values (p = 0.022), and TLC (p = 0.027). Higher MPV, PDW, and PCT values were observed in unsuccessful detumescence patients compared to the resolution group (p < 0.05). Statistically significant cutoff values for persistent priapism were measured by ROC as PLT: >= 254x103/muL; MPV: >= 13.2 fL; PDW: >= 15.6 fL; PCT: >= 24%; and TLC >= 8.5x103/L. Priapism duration of <= 17.9 hours was significantly related to detumescence rate (p = 0.000). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that priapism duration and higher MPV are prognostic parameters for detumescence in SCA. CONCLUSIONS: The higher MPV and duration of priapism can be used as parameters for evaluating detumescence outcomes in steady-state SCA with acute IP.

We evaluated the cost of treating SCD-related acute complications and the potential cost-savings of hydroxyurea in a specialized hematology center in Brazil. METHODS: The costs (US dollars) of emergency department (ED) and hospitalizations from SCD-related complications between 01.01.2018 and 06.30.2018 were ascertained using absorption and micro-costing approaches. The reasons for acute hospital visits were grouped as: 1) vaso-occlusive (VOC) pain, 2) infection, 3) anemia exacerbation, and 4) chronic organ damage complications. Hydroxyurea adherence was estimated by medication possession ratio (MPR) during the study period. RESULTS: In total, 1144 patients, median age 17 years (range 0-70), 903 (78.9%) with HbSS/HbSbeta0-thalassemia, 441 (38.5%) prescribed hydroxyurea, visited the ED, of whom 381 (33%) were admitted. VOC accounted for 64% of all ED visits and 60% of all admissions. Anemia exacerbation was the most expensive reason for ED visit ($321.87/visit), while chronic organ damage carried the highest admission cost ($2176.40/visit). Compared with other genotypes, individuals with HbSS/HbSbeta0-thalassemia were admitted more often (79% versus 21%, p < 0.0001), and their admission costs were higher ($1677.18 versus $1224.47/visit, p = 0.0001). Antibiotics and analgesics accounted for 43% and 42% of the total ED costs, respectively, while housing accounted for 46% of the total admission costs. Costs of ED visits not resulting in admissions were lower among HbSS/HbSbeta0-thalassemia individuals with hydroxyurea MPR >=65% compared with visits by patients with MPR <65% ($98.16/visit versus $182.46/visit, p = 0.0007). No difference in admission costs were observed relative to hydroxyurea use. DISCUSSION: In a LMIC hematology-specialized center, VOCs accounted for most acute visits from patients with SCD, but costs were highest due to anemia exacerbation. Analgesics, antibiotics, and housing drove most expenses. Hydroxyurea may reduce ED costs among individuals with HbSS/HbSbeta0-thalassemia but is dependent on adherence level.
34983921		Delayed Hemolytic Transfusion Reaction in Sickle Cell Disease: A Case Series.BACKGROUND Transfusion therapy has a well-established role in the management of several sickle cell disease (SCD)-related complications. Nevertheless, the benefits of transfusion must outweigh the possible risks, including iron overload, infections, and transfusion reactions. Alloimmunization is the underlying etiology of most delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions (DHTR). DHTR is often underestimated and underdiagnosed in sickle cell disease patients as it mimics a vaso-occlusive crisis in presentation. Alloimmunization to RBC antigens can be a serious complication of transfusion, which is of particular interest in individuals with SCD, as the occurrence rate is higher in this population. This complication represents a secondary immunological phenomenon that typically arises after the emergence of an alloantibody to which the patient had been previously sensitized to. CASE REPORT Here, we report 2 cases of delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction (DHTR) in which the patients showed evidence of alloimmunization from previous blood transfusions. The patients were managed with a variety of medications, including supportive treatments, utilization of immunosuppressive agents, and enhancement of erythropoiesis. Both patients had evidence of clinical and laboratory improvement following the management. CONCLUSIONS DHTR is considered one of the most deleterious complications of transfusion in SCD patients. The diagnosis and management of DHTR is very challenging, especially because it can present differently in this population. A high index of clinical suspicion is needed in addition to the laboratory criteria.
37399057		Sickle cell disease and coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) infection: a single-center experience.PURPOSE: Sickle cell disease (SCD) has been found to be associated with an increased risk of hospitalization and death from coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). We sought to study clinical outcomes in patients with SCD and a diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of adult patients (>18 years) with SCD who were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection between 1 March 2020 and 31 March 2021. Data on baseline characteristics and overall outcomes were collected and analyzed using SAS 9.4 for Windows. RESULTS: A total of 51 patients with SCD were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection in the study period, out of which 39.3% were diagnosed and managed in the outpatient setting/emergency room (ER) and 60.3% in the inpatient setting. Disease-modifying therapy such as hydroxyurea did not impact inpatient vs outpatient/ER management (P > 0.05). Only 5.71% (n = 2) required intensive care unit admission and were mechanically ventilated and 3.9% (2 patients) died of complications of COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSION: We identified a lower mortality (3.9%) rate among patients in our cohort in comparison to previous studies and a higher burden of inpatient hospitalizations as compared to outpatient/ER management. Further prospective data are needed to validate these findings. Key messages What is already known on this topic COVID-19 has been shown to have a disproportionately unfavorable impact on African Americans, including longer hospital stays, higher rates of ventilator dependence, and a higher overall mortality rate. Limited data also suggest that sickle cell disease (SCD) is associated with an increased risk of hospitalization and death from COVID-19. What this study adds Our analysis did not show a higher mortality due to COVID-19 in patients with SCD. However, we identified a high burden of inpatient hospitalizations in this population. COVID-19-related outcomes did not improve with the use of disease-modifying therapies. How this study might affect research, practice, or policy These results will aid in decision making for triage of patients with COVID-19 and SCD and ensure the most appropriate use of healthcare resources. Our analysis underscores the need for more robust data to identify patients at higher risk of severe disease and/or mortality, necessitating inpatient hospitalization and aggressive management.
36350716	treat|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell	Creating an Automated Contemporaneous Cohort in Sickle Cell Anemia to Predict Survival After Disease-Modifying Therapy.For participants receiving experimental gene therapy or gene editing clinical trials, the FDA requires contemporaneous controls to compare clinical outcomes. However, developing a contemporaneous cohort of rare diseases is costly and requires multiple person-hours. In a single referral center for sickle cell disease, we tested the hypothesis that we could create an automated contemporaneous cohort of children and adults with sickle cell anemia (SCA) to predict mortality. Data were obtained between 1/1/2004 and 4/30/2021. We identified 419 individuals with SCA with consistent medical care (i.e., followed continuously for >0.5 years with no visit gaps >=3.0 years). The median age was 10.2 years (IQR 1.0 - 24.0 years), with a median follow-up of 7.4 years (IQR 3.6-13.5 years) and 47 deaths. A total of 98% (274 of 277) of the children remained alive at 18 years of age, and 34.3% (94 of 274) of those children were followed into adulthood. For adults, the median age of survival was 49.3 years of age. Treatment groups were mutually exclusive and in a hierarchical order: hematopoietic stem cell transplant (n=22)>regular blood transfusion for at least two years (n=56)>hydroxyurea for at least one year (n=243)>no disease-modifying therapy (n=98). Compared to those receiving no disease-modifying treatment, those treated with hydroxyurea therapy had significantly lower hazard of mortality (hazard ratio=0.38, p=0.016), but no statistical difference for those receiving regular blood transfusions compared to no disease-modifying therapy (hazard ratio=0.71, p=0.440). An automated contemporaneous SCA cohort can be generated to estimate mortality in children and adults with SCA.

35104199		Lung Clearance Index May Detect Early Peripheral Lung Disease in Sickle Cell Anemia.Rationale: Chronic lung injury is common in sickle cell anemia (SCA) and worsens outcomes. Sensitive lung function tests might predict reversible disease that might benefit from therapeutic interventions. Objectives: To evaluate whether lung clearance index (LCI) (measuring global ventilation inhomogeneity), intraacinar ventilation inhomogeneity (Sacin), and conductive ventilation inhomogeneity (Scond) are more frequently abnormal than lung volumes in young people with SCA. Methods: Nitrogen multiple-breath washout, spirometry, and body plethysmography were cross-sectionally evaluated at steady state in subjects with SCA (hemoglobin SS) and healthy control subjects aged 8-21 years from London, United Kingdom. Results: Thirty-five patients (51% boys, mean +- SD age, 16.4 +- 3.5 yr) and 31 control subjects (48% boys; 16.2 +- 3.2 yr) were tested. There were significant differences between the study and control groups in mean LCI (mean difference, 0.42 units; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.22 to 0.63; P = 0.0001), Sacin (mean difference, 0.014 units; 95% CI, 0.001 to 0.026; P = 0.04), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) (mean difference, -0.79 z-scores; 95% CI, -1.28 to -0.30; P = 0.002), forced vital capacity (FVC) (mean difference, -0.80 z-scores; 95% CI, -1.28 to -0.31, P = 0.002), and total lung capacity (mean difference, -0.76 z-scores; 95% CI, -1.25 to -0.29, P = 0.002), but not in Scond and FEV1-to-FVC ratio. Whereas 29% (10 of 35) of patients had LCI > 95th percentile of control subjects, 23% (8 of 35) had abnormal FEV1 (<5th percentile of the reference population). Conclusions: LCI detected slightly more abnormalities than lung volumes in young people with SCA. Significant differences from control subjects in LCI and Sacin but not in Scond and FEV1-to-FVC ratio suggest that the lung function changes were most likely owing to patchy peripheral lung disease.
36541848		Delayed haemolytic transfusion reaction in paediatric patients with sickle cell disease: A retrospective study in a French national reference centre.Delayed haemolytic transfusion reaction (DHTR) is a life-threatening haemolytic anaemia following red blood cell transfusion in patients with sickle cell disease, with only scarce data in children. We retrospectively analysed 41 cases of DHTR in children treated between 2006 and 2020 in a French university hospital. DHTR manifested at a median age of 10.5 years, symptoms occurred a median of 8 days after transfusion performed for an acute event (63%), before surgery (20%) or in a chronic transfusion programme (17%). In all, 93% of patients had painful crisis. Profound anaemia (median 49 g/L), low reticulocyte count (median 140 x109 /L) and increased lactate dehydrogenase (median 2239 IU/L) were observed. Antibody screening was positive in 51% of patients, and more frequent when there was a history of alloimmunisation. Although no deaths were reported, significant complications occurred in 51% of patients: acute chest syndrome (12 patients), cholestasis (five patients), stroke (two patients) and kidney failure (two patients). A further transfusion was required in 23 patients and corticosteroids were used in 21 to reduce the risk of additional haemolysis. In all, 13 patients subsequently received further transfusions with recurrence of DHTR in only two. The study affords a better overview of DHTR and highlights the need to establish guidelines for its management in children.
36052816	associate|@CHEMICAL_Oxygen|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell	An evaluation of cardiopulmonary endurance and muscular strength in adults living with sickle cell disease.There have been limited investigations into exercise in sickle cell disease (SCD). In the general population, health is reflected in general physical fitness. It is unclear if the same associations are seen in people with SCD. Here, we report a cross-sectional assessment of two important measures of physical fitness, muscle strength and cardiorespiratory endurance, in adults with SCD. A total of 29 adults with SCD (aged 24-62 years; 72% female) completed cardiopulmonary and muscular strength testing using a cycle ergometer and an isokinetic dynamometer. Adults with SCD had lower median values for cardiorespiratory endurance (the median [interquartile range, IQR] peak oxygen uptake [VO2 ] 16.1 [6.3] vs. 42.65 [11.3] ml/kg/min, p < 0.001) and knee strength (median [IQR] flexor torque 26.91[22.5] vs. 55.6 [22.7] Nm, p < 0.001) compared to controls and predicted values. Interestingly, there was a very positive association between muscular strength and peak VO2 values for adults with SCD (r = 0.53, p = 0.003) suggesting these values may be useful in determining cardiopulmonary health.
36579749	treat|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell	Trends in blood transfusion, hydroxyurea use, and iron overload among children with sickle cell disease enrolled in Medicaid, 2004-2019.BACKGROUND: There have been significant changes in clinical guidelines for sickle cell disease (SCD) over the past two decades, including updated indications for hydroxyurea, transfusions, and iron overload management. In practice however, there are few studies that examine SCD care utilization over time. METHODS: We conducted a serial cross-sectional cohort study of pediatric SCD patients from 2004 to 2019 using Georgia Medicaid claims data. For each year, we reported receipt of any transfusion, chronic transfusion, or three or more filled hydroxyurea prescriptions. For children receiving chronic transfusion (six or more annual transfusions), we evaluated iron overload diagnosis, monitoring, and chelation use. Among children with sickle cell anemia (SCA), we examined rates of transfusions and hydroxyurea use. The Cochran-Armitage test was used to assess trend. RESULTS: There were 5316 unique children 2-18 years old with SCD enrolled in Georgia Medicaid from 2004 to 2019. Children receiving any transfusion increased from 2004 to 2010, then stabilized. In SCA patients, chronic transfusions initially increased from 2004 to 2010, then stabilized from 2010 to 2019. For chronically transfused children, monitoring of iron burden and filled chelator prescriptions both increased significantly. Hydroxyurea use in SCA patients increased from 12% to 37%, with increases noted within each age group, most notably from 21% to 60% in the 13-18-year-old cohort. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated changes in SCD care utilization over time, including increased hydroxyurea use, changes in transfusion rates, and increased attention to iron overload management. While trends in clinical management do follow updates in treatment guidelines, there is still delayed and suboptimal uptake of guideline recommendations in pediatric SCD patients.

A widely used conditioning backbone is busulfan, fludarabine, and rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (rATG). Thiotepa has improved engraftment when added to this regimen, however the minimum effective dose (MED) of thiotepa to achieve engraftment while minimizing toxicities has not been well established. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this prospective feasibility study was to determine the MED of thiotepa (5mg/kg) in combination with reduced-dose busulfan, fludarabine or cyclophosphamide, and rATG required to achieve engraftment in >90% of HSCT recipients for non-malignant disorders with acceptable toxicity. RESULTS: Six patients who received fully matched HSCT were enrolled. Patient diagnoses included Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (n = 1), CD40L deficiency (n = 1), sickle cell disease (n = 2), autoinflammatory syndrome (n = 1), and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (n = 1). All six patients achieved engraftment prior to Day +42 and five patients had stable full donor engraftment. Two of the six patients (33%) developed acute GVHD and/or chronic GHVD, both of whom had sickle cell disease. At a median follow-up of 2.25 years post-transplant, all patients were alive without evidence of disease recurrence. None of the patients experienced grade 4 or 5 toxicities. Three out of six patients (50%) developed grade 3 adverse events. Neurocognitive functioning of children under 10 years of age was not adversely affected by this regimen. CONCLUSION: This approach shows acceptable toxicity and reliable engraftment in children with non-malignant disorders receiving related or unrelated HLA-matched transplants.
36109730		Blood pressure in children with sickle cell disease is higher than in the general pediatric population.BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease that may be due to a variety of possible risk factors, including abnormal blood pressure. Blood pressure (BP) of children and adolescents with SCD has been reported to be lower compared to the BP of the general pediatric population. METHODS: To confirm this prior observation, we compared reference BP values for children with SCD with reference BP values of the general pediatric population. We hypothesized that children with SCD do not have lower BPs than children without SCD. RESULTS: Systolic BP differed for both males and females, over the different age groups between pediatric subjects with and without SCD. Systolic BP was higher in children with SCD, in both obese and non-obese populations. Diastolic BP did not differ between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis demonstrated that systolic BP values are indeed higher in children with SCD than in the general pediatric population. This finding is consistent with the most recent literature showing abnormal BP patterns in the SCD pediatric population utilizing 24-hour BP monitoring devices. This is an important step for recognizing abnormal BP as a risk factor for cardio- and neurovascular events in SCD.

37399450		Early Diagnosis of Sickle Cell Disease at Birth Hospitals and Vaccination Centers in Angola Using Point-of-Care Tests.Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a life-threatening blood disorder affecting >300,000 infants annually, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa. Most infants do not have access to an early diagnosis and die early from treatable complications of SCD. Universal NBS is not yet available in any African country for a variety of reasons, including lack of laboratory capacity, difficulty in tracking affected infants, and the relatively short stay of mothers and newborns at maternity hospitals. Several point-of-care (POC) tests for SCD have been recently developed and validated, but the two most well-established tests (Sickle SCAN and HemoTypeSC) have not been rigorously compared to one another. In this study, we aimed to evaluate and compare these two POC tests to screen infants <=6 months of age in Luanda, Angola. Challenging the traditional NBS paradigm, we performed testing not only at maternity centers, but also at vaccination centers across Luanda. We enrolled 2,000 babies and performed 1,000 tests with each POC test. Both tests demonstrated diagnostic accuracy, with 98.3% of Sickle SCAN results and 95.3% of HemoTypeSC results aligning with the gold standard isoelectric focusing hemoglobin pattern. When the result was provided at the POC, 92% of infants were linked to SCD care compared to 56% in the pilot Angolan NBS program, which used centralized laboratory testing. This study demonstrates the real-world feasibility and accuracy of POC tests to screen infants for SCD in Angola. This study also suggests that including vaccination centers may improve the capture rate for early infant SCD screening programs.

37967611	treat|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Hypertension_Pulmonary	Pulmonary Hypertension in Sickle Cell Disease.Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a complex genetic disorder that has long challenged both patients and healthcare professionals. One of its chronic and debilitating complications is pulmonary hypertension (PH). SCD-associated PH is often post-capillary, secondary to left heart disease. It can also sometimes be pre-capillary with multiple and often interrelated mechanisms including obstructive remodeling of the pulmonary vascular bed secondary to hemolysis, endothelial dysfunction, thrombosis, hypoxia, or associated risk factors like portal hypertension. Screening symptomatic patients with echocardiographic signs of PH is crucial to determine those who should undergo right heart catheterization, the cornerstone exam to diagnose and categorize patients with PH. The workup following the diagnosis relies on identifying the cause of PH to personalize treatment. Ongoing efforts are made to treat this complex condition, starting with treating the underlying disease with hydroxyurea or chronic blood exchange transfusion. Robust data on the efficacy of PAH-specific therapies are lacking in this specific population. Initiation of such therapies must be made by an expert center after a case-by-case assessment of the benefit-risk ratio according to the phenotype and the mechanisms involved in the development of PH. Efforts are also poured into studying the interventional and medical therapies used on chronic thromboembolic PH for patients presenting with a thrombotic form. The management of those patients requires a multidisciplinary approach, with conjoint efforts from PH and SCD specialists.

34773444		Measuring transition readiness in adolescents and young adults with sickle cell disease using the transition readiness assessment questionnaire.BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Adolescents and young adults (AYA) with sickle cell disease (SCD) face challenges related to the disease and its treatment. The Transition Readiness Assessment Questionnaire (TRAQ) is a self-report tool for assessing transition readiness for youth with special health care needs (YSHCN), including SCD. This study uses the TRAQ to understand transition readiness in patients with SCD treated at the Boston Medical Center and evaluates associations between TRAQ scores and transition outcomes (e.g., emergency department reliance [EDr] and emergency department utilization [EDu]). METHODS: We reviewed electronic medical records of AYA with SCD who completed the TRAQ in the pediatric hematology clinic between January 1, 2019, and March 1, 2020, and categorized healthcare encounters to calculate EDu and EDr.  We used t tests and ANOVA models to analyze mean TRAQ scores, sex, age, genotype, EDu, and EDr. RESULTS: The sample was 45 AYA patients with SCD between 13 and 22 years old. The mean TRAQ score for the overall patient sample was 3.67. Mean TRAQ scores did not significantly vary by sex or genotype but did significantly increase with age. TRAQ scores did not correlate to EDu or EDr. CONCLUSIONS: AYA patients with SCD have low transition readiness. The age of 18 may not be the most reliable attribute of readiness, though older patients do have higher readiness. The relationship between TRAQ scores, EDr, and EDu is not clear and requires further evaluation.

35093595		Sickle cell disease and COVID-19 in pregnant women.INTRODUCTION: The effect of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on pregnancy outcome in women with sickle cell disease (SCD) is unknown. OBJECTIVES: To analyze the severity of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant women with SCD and its impact on pregnancy. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included SCD pregnant women tested positive for COVID-19 between March 2020 - February 2021. The primary endpoint was the severity of the COVID-19 infection. Secondary endpoints were pregnancy complications and fetal outcomes. RESULTS: During the study period among 82 pregnant women with SCD, 8 have presented symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 and were tested positive. A common mild clinical presentation was observed in 6 women (75%), one woman was asymptomatic and one required oxygen. The latter was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit and a cesarean section was performed in the context of an ongoing vaso-occlusive crisis and acute chest syndrome together with incidental preeclampsia. Labor was induced in another patient who developed a vaso-occlusive crisis after COVID-19 remission. Fetal outcomes were good with an average Apgar score of 10 and normal umbilical blood pH at birth. Two newborns were small-for-gestational-age as expected on the ultrasound follow-up before occurrence of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 infection in our population of pregnant women with SCD had typical presentation and rarely triggered a sickle cell crisis or other complications. Fetal outcomes were good and did not seem to be directly influenced by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Further studies are required to confirm these observations as compared to the population of women with SCD without COVID-19 infection.
35696734		Longitudinal study of glomerular hyperfiltration in adults with sickle cell anemia: a multicenter pooled analysis.Glomerular hyperfiltration is common in young sickle cell anemia patients and precedes development of overt kidney disease. In this multicenter pooled cohort, we characterized hyperfiltration and its decline to normal range in adult patients. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated using the creatinine-based 2009 CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) equation omitting race adjustment and the 2021 CKD-EPI equation. Using CKD-EPI-2009, 506 patients had baseline estimated GFR (eGFR) >=90 mL/min per 1.73 m2, median age of 24 (interquartile range [IQR], 19-34) years and 5.17 years of follow-up. The prevalence of hyperfiltration (eGFR >=140 and >=130 mL/min per 1.73 m2 for men and women, respectively) was 38.3%. Using CKD-EPI-2009, baseline hyperfiltration was less likely with older age (odds ratio [OR], 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73-0.83; P < .0001), male sex (OR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.18-0.58; P = .0002), and higher weight (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.94-0.99; P = .001). Using CKD-EPI-2021, hyperfiltration was similarly less likely with older age (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.70-0.81; P < .0001), male sex (OR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.13-0.44; P < .0001), and higher weight (OR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.95-0.99; P = .004). In patients with baseline hyperfiltration, eGFR declined to normal values at a median age of 26.2 years. Using CKD-EPI-2009, this decline was associated with male sex (HR, 2.20; 95% CI, 1.26-3.87; P = .006), systolic blood pressure (hazard ratio [HR], 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01-1.04; P = .01), and hydroxyurea use (HR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.002-3.03; P = .05). Using CKD-EPI-2021, decline of eGFR to normal was only associated with male sex (HR, 3.39; 95% CI, 2.01-5.69; P < .0001). Decline to normal eGFR range from hyperfiltration occurs earlier in males, those on hydroxyurea, and with higher systolic blood pressure.
37184905		Developing an Implementation Blueprint for the NIH HEAL Initiative GRACE Trial: Perspectives on Acupuncture and Guided Relaxation for Chronic Sickle Cell Disease Pain.Objective: This study aimed to explore perspectives of people living with sickle cell disease (SCD) and SCD clinic providers and staff about the use of acupuncture and guided relaxation for treating chronic SCD pain. Data obtained were to inform an implementation blueprint for an effectiveness implementation clinical trial (GRACE Trial) testing whether acupuncture or guided relaxation reduces chronic pain when compared with usual care. Design: Qualitative research design. Methods: We conducted 33 semistructured interviews with people with SCD and SCD clinic providers and staff. Interviews were transcribed and coded. A deductive content analysis process was used to identify themes. Results: Four themes were identified: Receptivity to Acupuncture and Guided Relaxation, Limited Awareness, Complementary and Integrative Health (CIH) Therapy Preference, and Access Barriers. Both patients and clinic providers and staff were open to the use of acupuncture and guided relaxation for chronic pain treatment. After learning about these CIH therapies, some patients expressed a preference for one therapy over the other. They also discussed their ability to successfully engage with each therapy. There is a need to dispel misconceptions about the therapies by increasing understanding of how each therapy is implemented and functions to reduce pain. We identified several potential barriers that might affect the success of the trial and future health system integration, including time, transportation, and technology. Conclusion: This study is one of the first to present perspectives of both patients with SCD and clinic providers and staff on the use of acupuncture and guided relaxation for chronic SCD pain. Stakeholders' early input and perspectives highlighted that they welcome nonpharmacological CIH therapies. Implementation of a clinical trial and future health system integration will require the addressing misinformation and identifying strategies to overcome access barriers.

34348300		Assessment of Renal Function Status in Steady-State Sickle Cell Anaemic Children Using Urine Human Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin and Albumin:Creatinine Ratio.INTRODUCTION: Sickle cell anaemia is characterized by defective haemoglobin synthesis and is associated with both endocrine and metabolic alterations. The effects of this clinical condition on kidney function are multifactorial and often begin early in childhood. This study aims to assess renal function in children with sickle cell anaemia using urine albumin:creatinine ratio (ACR) and urine human neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL). METHODS: This case-control study was conducted on 200 children aged 5-15 years in 2 tertiary hospitals in South West Nigeria: 150 were of haemoglobin S genotype and 50 were of haemoglobin A genotype. Serum urea, creatinine, urine albumin, and NGAL were assayed by known standard methods. eGFR, urine ACR, and urine NGAL/creatinine ratio (urine NCR) were calculated. RESULTS: The weight, height, BMI, systolic blood pressure, plasma urea, plasma creatinine, and spot urine creatinine of the HbS genotype children were significantly lower compared to that of the HbA genotype children. The eGFR, spot urine albumin, and urine ACR were significantly higher in the HbS group compared to the HbA group. There was no significant difference in the spot urine NGAL and urine NCR between the 2 groups, though both were higher in the HbS group compared to the HbA group. CONCLUSIONS: Kidney injury probably starts early in childhood in sickle cell individuals as indicated by the higher urine ACR detected in them. We infer that urine NGAL and uNCR are not sensitive markers of kidney disease especially in young sickle cell individuals possibly because of the hyperfiltration present at this age.
38066873		Alloimmunization and hyperhemolysis in sickle cell disease.Alloimmunization against red blood cell antigens and delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction (DHTR) are major barriers to transfusion in sickle cell disease (SCD). In SCD, DHTR is a potentially life-threatening. Blood group polymorphism in SCD patients, who are of African ancestry and frequently exposed to antigens they do not carry; an inflammatory clinical state; and occasional transfusion in acute situations are risk factors for alloimmunization and DHTR. In patients at risk, the transfusion indication must be balanced against the risk of developing DHTR. However, when transfusion is absolutely necessary, protocols combining the prevention of exposure to immunogenic antigens with immunosuppressive treatments must be implemented, and patients should be carefully monitored during posttransfusion follow-up. This close monitoring makes it possible to diagnose hyperhemolysis as soon as possible; to avoid retransfusion, which can exacerbate hemolysis; and to administer specific treatments, such as anticomplement therapy, in severe cases. Finally, in patients with severe disease, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation may be indicated. However, transfusion is also required in this context, and its management is complex because these risks must be taken into account.
35260809		A population-based analysis of predictors of penile surgical intervention among inpatients with acute priapism.While consensus exists regarding risk factors for priapism, predictors of operative intervention are less well established. We assessed patient and hospital-level predictors associated with penile surgical intervention (PSI) for patients admitted with acute priapism, as well as length of stay (LOS) and total hospital charges using the National Inpatient Sample (2010-2015). Inpatients with acute priapism were stratified by PSI, defined as penile shunts, incisions, and placement of penile prostheses, exclusive of irrigation procedures. Survey-weighted logistic regression models were utilized to assess predictors of PSI. Negative binomial regression and generalized linear models with logarithmic transformation were used to compare PSI to LOS and total hospital charges, respectively. Among 14,529 weighted hospitalizations, 4,953 underwent PSI. Non-Medicare insurances, substance abuse, and >=3 Elixhauser comorbidities had increased odds of PSI. Conversely, Black patients, sickle cell disease, alcohol abuse, neurologic diseases, malignancies, and teaching hospitals had lower odds. PSI coincided with shorter median LOS (adjusted IRR: 0.62; p < 0.001) and lower ratio of the mean hospital charges (adjusted Ratio: 0.49; p < 0.001). Additional subgroup analysis revealed penile incisions and shunts primarily associated with reduced LOS (adjusted IRR: 0.66; p < 0.001) and total hospital charges (adjusted Ratio: 0.49; p < 0.001). Further work is required to understand predictors of poor outcomes in these populations.

Serum insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) was low in SCD subjects and SCD mice. To determine if decreased IGF1 associated with low bone mass in SCD is due to reduced SCFA production by gut microbiota, we performed reciprocal fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) between healthy control (Ctrl) and SCD mice. uCT and histomorphometry analysis of femur showed decreased bone volume/total volume (BV/TV), trabecular number (Tb.N), osteoblast surface/bone surface (Ob.S/BS), mineralizing surface/ bone surface (MS/BS), inter-label thickness (Ir.L.Th) in SCD mice were significantly improved after receiving Ctrl feces. Bone formation genes Alp, Col1, Runx2, and Dmp1 from SCD mice were significantly decreased and were rescued after FMT from Ctrl feces. Transplantation of Ctrl feces increased the butyrate, valerate, and propionate levels in cecal content of SCD mice. Decreased G-coupled protein receptors 41 and 43 (GPR41 and GPR43) mRNA in tibia and lower IGF1 in bone and serum of SCD mice were partially restored after FMT from Ctrl feces. These data indicate that the healthy gut microbiota of Ctrl mice is protective for SCD bone loss through regulating IGF1 in response to impaired bacterial metabolites SCFAs.
38190311		An Updated Equitable Model of Readiness for Transition to Adult Care: Content Validation in Young People With Sickle Cell Disease.IMPORTANCE: Despite elevated health risks during young adulthood, many adolescents and young adults with serious health care needs face barriers during the transfer to an adult specialty practitioner, and health disparities may occur during the transition. OBJECTIVE: To validate the content of an updated Social-Ecological Model of Adolescent and Young Adult Readiness for Transition to Promote Health Equity (SMART-E) in a group of adolescents and young adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) and their supports. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Health equity framework components were reviewed. Systems of power (eg, institutional and practitioner bias) and environments or networks (eg, peer or school support) were added as SMART-E preexisting factors, and health literacy was included within readiness factors. Adolescents and young adults aged 16 to 29 years with SCD, caregivers, and practitioners participated in this convergent, mixed-methods study within Children's Hospital of Philadelphia between January and August 2022. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Content validity was assessed through nominations of top 3 most important transition barriers prior to interviews and focus groups, ratings on importance of SMART-E factors (0-4 scale; ratings >2 support validity) after interviews and focus groups, nominations of 3 most important factors for transition and for health equity, and qualitative content analysis of interview transcripts. RESULTS: The study enrolled 10 pediatric adolescents and young adults (mean [SD] age, 18.6 [2.9] years; 4 female and 6 male), 10 transferred adolescents and young adults (mean [SD] age, 22.9 [2.1] years; 8 female and 2 male), 9 caregivers (mean [SD] age, 49.8 [8.7] years; 5 female and 4 male), and 9 practitioners (mean [SD] age, 45.6 [10.5] years; 8 female and 1 male). Quantitative ratings supported the content validity of SMART-E and met established criteria for validity. Systems of power was the most endorsed transition barrier (14 of 38 participants) reported prior to interviews and focus groups. After the interview, participants endorsed all SMART-E factors as important for transition, with new factors systems of power and environments and networks rated at a mean (SD) 2.8 (1.23) and 3.1 (0.90), respectively, on a 0 to 4 scale of importance. The most important factors for transition and equity varied by participant group, with all factors being endorsed, supporting the comprehensiveness of SMART-E. Qualitative data corroborated quantitative findings, further supporting validity, and minor modifications were made to definitions. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: SMART-E obtained initial content validation with inclusion of health equity factors for adolescents and young adults with SCD, caregivers, and practitioners. The model should be evaluated in other populations of adolescents and young adults with chronic disease.
37190012		CRISPR-Cas System: The Current and Emerging Translational Landscape.CRISPR-Cas technology has rapidly changed life science research and human medicine. The ability to add, remove, or edit human DNA sequences has transformative potential for treating congenital and acquired human diseases. The timely maturation of the cell and gene therapy ecosystem and its seamless integration with CRISPR-Cas technologies has enabled the development of therapies that could potentially cure not only monogenic diseases such as sickle cell anemia and muscular dystrophy, but also complex heterogenous diseases such as cancer and diabetes. Here, we review the current landscape of clinical trials involving the use of various CRISPR-Cas systems as therapeutics for human diseases, discuss challenges, and explore new CRISPR-Cas-based tools such as base editing, prime editing, CRISPR-based transcriptional regulation, CRISPR-based epigenome editing, and RNA editing, each promising new functionality and broadening therapeutic potential. Finally, we discuss how the CRISPR-Cas system is being used to understand the biology of human diseases through the generation of large animal disease models used for preclinical testing of emerging therapeutics.

38036693		Total hip replacement among sickle cell patients in a low-income country-Yemen.PURPOSE: Sickle cell patients presented with progressive hip pain and limitation of daily activities, as evidenced by low preoperative hip scores and failed conservative therapy. Management of femoral head avascular necrosis (AVN) using total hip replacement (THR) in sickle cell disease (SCD) is widespread in developed countries, but it is still in its initiation stage in developing countries. The outcome of using cementless THR among SCD patients is still unknown with lack of published studies from regional countries. This study aimed to evaluate the outcome of using cementless primary THR among patients with sickle cell disease with end-stage hip avascular necrosis in Yemen. METHODS: Thirty cementless primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) were performed for AVN of the femoral head in 27 sickle cell patients, at Al.-Thawra Modern General Hospital-Sana'a, Yemen, from January 2018 to December 2022. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 27 +- five years (ranged 18-37 years) with a male to female ratio was 3:1. Steinberg staging for hip AVN was stage IV, one patient (3%); stage VI, thirteen patients (45%); and stage V, sixteen patients (51%). THR was on right side 14 (52%), left side 10 (37%), and bilateral 3 (11%). The implant used was ceramic on polyethylene acetabular liner. All patients showed improvement in Harris hip score from preoperative mean hip score was 25 +- 8 points to postoperative mean hip score was 88 +- 6 points at the last follow-up. Mean of the length of stay in hospital was 12.7 +- eight days (ranged from 4 to 32 days); the mean operating time was 107 +- 23 min. Three cases had superficial wound infection; four patients had five intraoperative fractures; two cases had pulmonary complications; one case had abdominal crisis. All patients had postoperative leg length discrepancy less than 2 cm. None had deep infection, nerve injury, wound hematoma, aseptic loosing, dislocation, DVT, heterotopic ossification, or death. CONCLUSION: THR in SCD has a good outcome using cementless THA with a low rate of complication in Yemen, a developing country.

There is a huge variation in the phenotypic expressions of SCD and VOC owing to genetic and environmental factors. This study aimed to characterize the whole blood gene expression profile using Microarray technology in Bahraini patients with SCD determining the differentially expressed genes in steady-state (n = 10) and during VOC (n = 10) in comparison to healthy controls (n = 8). Additionally, the study intended to identify potential genetic marker associated with hemolysis. The analysis identified 2073 and 3363 genes that were dysregulated during steady-state and VOC, respectively, compared to healthy controls. Moreover, 1078 genes were differentially expressed during VOC compared to steady state. The PLSCR4 gene was almost 6-fold up-regulated in microarray, 4-fold in polymerase chain reaction, and a mean protein concentration of 0.856 ng/ml was observed in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay during VOC compared to steady-state (0.238 ng/ml) (p < 0.01). Amongst these genes, PLSCR4 is involved in erythrocyte membrane deformity thus, predisposing to hemolysis, adhesion, and thrombosis. In conclusion, PLSCR4 may serve as a potential biomarker for VOC and future large-scale validation are recommended.

34350622	treat|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell ;cause|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Learning_Disabilities	Patient-reported neurocognitive symptoms influence instrumental activities of daily living in sickle cell disease.Individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD) experience neurocognitive decline, low medication adherence, increased unemployment, and difficulty with instrumental activities of daily living (IADL). The relationship between self-perceived cognitive difficulties and IADLs, including employment, school enrollment, independence, engagement in leisure activities, and medication adherence is unknown. We hypothesized that self-reported difficulties across neurocognitive areas would predict lower IADL skills. Adolescent and adult participants of the multi-site Sickle Cell Disease Implementation Consortium (SCDIC) (n = 2436) completed patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures of attention, executive functioning, processing speed, learning, and comprehension. Cognitive symptoms were analyzed as predictors in multivariable modeling. Outcome variables included 1) an IADL composite that consisted of employment, participation in school, reliance on others, and leisure pursuits, and 2) hydroxyurea adherence. Participants reported cognitive difficulty across areas of attention (55%), executive functioning (51%), processing speed (57%), and reading comprehension (65%). Executive dysfunction (p < 0.001) and sometimes or often experiencing learning difficulties (p < 0.001 and p = 0.04) and poor comprehension (p = 0.000 and p = 0.001), controlled for age (p < 0.001), pain (p < 0.001), and hydroxyurea use (p = 0.001), were associated with poor IADL skills. Executive functioning difficulties (p = 0.021), controlled for age (p = 0.013 for ages 25-34), genotype (p = 0.001), and hemoglobin (p = 0.004), predicted hydroxyurea non-adherence. Analysis of PRO measures indicated that cognitive dysfunction is prevalent in adolescents and adults with SCD. Cognitive dysfunction translated into clinically meaningful outcomes. PRO of cognitive symptoms can be used as an important adjunct clinical tool to monitor symptoms that impact functional skills, including engagement in societal activities and medication adherence.
37858508	treat|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell	The evolving treatment landscape for children with sickle cell disease.Sickle cell disease is the most common inherited pathological haemoglobinopathy. Over the past 30 years, disease-related morbidity and mortality have improved in high-income countries due to advances in preventive care and treatments. Established disease-modifying therapies, such as hydroxyurea (hydrocarbamide), are continuing to have an important role in the treatment of sickle cell disease, and newer agents also show promise. In the past 5 years, the US Food and Drug Administration approved three additional sickle cell disease-modifying medications, and new gene therapies have been developed as an alternative curative treatment to haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. In this Review, we discuss the current treatment landscape for paediatric sickle cell disease and emerging innovations in care. We also review the need for close, long-term management for children receiving newer therapies and the importance of ongoing investment in people with sickle cell disease in low-income and middle-income countries.
38348535		Pain screening in youth with sickle cell disease: A quality improvement study.BACKGROUND: Youth with sickle cell disease (SCD) face several challenges as they age, including increased pain frequency, duration, and interference. The purpose of this study was to (i) determine the feasibility of routine pain screening; (ii) identify and describe various clinical pain presentations; and (iii) understand preferences/resources related to engaging in integrative health and medicine (IHM) modalities within an outpatient pediatric SCD clinic. METHODS: During routine outpatient visits, patients aged 8-18 completed measures of pain frequency, duration, and chronic pain risk (Pediatric Pain Screening Tool [PPST]). Participants screening positive for (i) persistent or chronic pain or (ii) medium or high risk for persistent symptoms and disability on the PPST were asked to complete measures of pain interference, pain catastrophizing, and interest in/resources for engaging in IHM modalities. RESULTS: Between March 2022 and May 2023, 104/141 (73.8%) patients who attended at least one outpatient visit were screened. Of these 104 (mean age 12.46, 53.8% female, 63.5% HbSS), 34 (32.7%) reported persistent or chronic pain, and 48 (46.2%) reported medium or high risk for persistent symptoms and disability. Patients completing subsequent pain screening measures reported a mean pain interference T-score of 53.2 +- 8.8 and a mean pain catastrophizing total score of 24.3 +- 10.2. Patients expressed highest interest in music (55.6%) and art therapy (51.9%) and preferred in-person (81.5%) over virtual programming (22.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive pain screening is feasible within pediatric SCD care. Classifying patients by PPST risk may provide a means of triaging patients to appropriate services to address pain-related psychosocial factors.

Despite displaying characteristics of vascular dysfunction, SCD patients tend to present relatively lower systemic blood pressure (BP), via an unknown mechanism. We investigated associations between BP and renin-angiotensin-system (RAS) components in SCD and determined whether an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE; often used to slow SCD glomerulopathy) further modulates BP and RAS components in a murine model of SCD. METHODS: BP was compared in human subjects and mice with/without SCD. Plasma angiotensin II, ACE and renin were measured by immunoassay. BP was reevaluated after treating mice with enalapril (25 mg/kg, 5x/week) for 5 weeks; plasma and organs were stored for angiotensin II and ACE activity measurement, and quantitative real-time PCR. RESULTS: Diastolic BP and systolic BP were significantly lower in patients and mice with SCD, respectively, compared to controls. Reduced BP was associated with increased plasma renin and markers of kidney damage (mice) in SCD, as well as significantly decreased plasma ACE concentrations and ACE enzyme activity. As expected, enalapril administration lowered BP, plasma angiotensin II and organ ACE activity in control mice. In contrast, enalapril did not further reduce BP or organ ACE activity in SCD mice; however, plasma angiotensin II and renin levels were found to be significantly higher in enalapril-treated SCD mice than those of treated control mice. CONCLUSION: Relative hypotension was confirmed in a murine model of SCD, in association with decreased ACE concentrations in both human and murine disease. Given that ACE inhibition has an accepted role in decreasing BP, further studies should investigate mechanisms by which ACE depletion, via both Ang II-dependent and alternative pathways, could contribute to reduce BP in SCD and understand how ACE inhibition confers Ang II-independent benefits on kidney function in SCD.

Patients are at increased risk of venous thromboembolism. There are no guidelines for the management of venous thromboembolism in sickle cell disease specifically in terms of the anticoagulant of choice. PATIENT CONCERNS: Here, we report a case of a 30-year-old lady with past medical history of sickle cell disease who came with chest pain and shortness of breath. DIAGNOSIS: We found that she has bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE). INTERVENTION: She was started on rivaroxaban. OUTCOME: The patient was followed for 18 months, she did not suffer from recurrence of PE, and she did not develop any complications related to rivaroxaban. CONCLUSION: We concluded that rivaroxaban is effective in treating PE in sicklers and also it is safe.
34252204		Impact of universal irradiation on chronic transfusion for sickle cell disease.BACKGROUND: Irradiation of blood products prevents transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease, but most patients do not require this modification which could have an adverse impact on transfusion outcomes. We hypothesized that irradiation may increase transfusion requirements for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) receiving chronic transfusion. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Our pediatric hospital implemented a new policy of universal blood product irradiation in May 2018. We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients with SCD receiving chronic red blood cell (RBC) transfusion throughout the year before and after institution of this policy. The primary outcome was the change in RBC transfusion volume per patient weight transfused during the pre- vs. post- universal irradiation period. Secondary outcomes were the change in median pretransfusion laboratory values. RESULTS: Among 17 patients, 8 (47%) received more RBCs the year before irradiation and 9 (53%) received more the year after irradiation. Implementation of universal irradiation did not significantly increase transfusion volumes needed to clinically manage this population (median change +1.7 ml/kg/year, p = .54). Additionally, there were no significant changes in absolute reticulocyte count, hemoglobin, hemoglobin S%, white blood cell count, lactate dehydrogenase, total bilirubin, serum potassium, and ferritin during the two time periods. CONCLUSION: In a cohort of patients with SCD receiving simple chronic transfusion, irradiation did not impact transfusion requirements or pertinent pretransfusion laboratory values. Irradiation does not appear to have clinically significant consequences for SCD chronic transfusion management.
34236515	associate|@CHEMICAL_Iron|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell ;cause|@CHEMICAL_Iron|@DISEASE_Learning_Disabilities	Hidden brain iron content in sickle cell disease: impact on neurocognitive functions.Children with sickle cell disease (SCD) are at a high risk for neurocognitive impairment. We aim to quantitatively measure cerebral tissue R2* to investigate the brain iron deposition in children and young adults with SCD in comparison to beta thalassemia major (BTM) and healthy controls and evaluate its impact on neurocognitive functions in patients with SCD. Thirty-two SCD, fifteen BTM, and eleven controls were recruited. Multi-echo fast-gradient echo sequence brain MRI was performed, and brain R2* values of both caudate and thalamic regions were calculated. SCD patients were examined for the neurocognitive functions. SCD had high iron overload 0.30 +- 0.12 mg/kg/day. 68.9% of SCD had under-threshold IQ, 12.5% had moderate to severe anxiety, and 60.8% had depression. There were no differences between SCD, BTM, and controls in brain MRI except that left thalamus R2* higher in BTM than both SCD and controls (p = 0.032). Mean right caudate R2* was higher in female than male (p = 0.044). No significant association between brain R2* and LIC or heart R2* values in SCD. Left caudate R2* directly correlate with age and HbS%, and negatively correlate with HbA% while right thalamus R2* negatively correlate with transfusion index and among SCD patients.Conclusion: Neurocognitive dysfunction in SCD could not be explained solely by brain iron overload. What is Known:   Children with sickle cell disease are at great risk of brain damage due to their irregularly shaped red blood cells that can interrupt blood flow to the brain.   There are a number of factors that have negative brain effects that result in learning difficulties, and this not only due to increase brain iron content. What is New:   Assessment of quantitative brain iron content using MRI R2* in children and young adults with SCD in comparison to beta thalassemia major and healthy controls.   Impact of brain iron content on neurocognitive functions of children and young adults with SCD.
34023973		Impact of a submaximal mono-articular exercise on the skeletal muscle function of patients with sickle cell disease.PURPOSE: Sickle cell disease (SCD) patients exhibit a limited exercise tolerance commonly attributed to anaemia, as well as hemorheological and cardio-respiratory abnormalities, but the functional status of skeletal muscle at exercise is unknown. Moreover, the effect of SCD genotype on exercise tolerance and skeletal muscle function has been poorly investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate skeletal muscle function and fatigue during a submaximal exercise in SCD patients. METHODS: Nineteen healthy individuals (AA), 28 patients with sickle cell anaemia (SS) and 18 with sickle cell-haemoglobin C disease (SC) performed repeated knee extensions exercise (FAT). Maximal isometric torque (Tmax) was measured before and after the FAT to quantify muscle fatigability. Electromyographic activity and oxygenation by near-infrared spectroscopy of the Vastus Lateralis were recorded. RESULTS: FAT caused a reduction in Tmax in SS (- 17.0 +- 12.1%, p < 0.001) and SC (- 21.5 +- 14.5%, p < 0.05) but not in AA (+ 0.58 +- 29.9%). Root-mean-squared value of EMG signal (RMS) decreased only in SS after FAT, while the median power frequency (MPF) was unchanged in all groups. Oxygenation kinetics were determined in SS and AA and were not different. CONCLUSION: These results show skeletal muscle dysfunction during exercise in SCD patients, and suggest different fatigue aetiology between SS and SC. The changes in EMG signal and oxygenation kinetics during exercise suggest that the greater skeletal muscle fatigue occurring in SCD patients would be rather due to intramuscular alterations modifications than decreased tissue oxygenation. Moreover, SS patients exhibit greater muscle fatigability than SC.
36519666		Reconsidering sickle cell trait testing of red blood cell units allocated to children with sickle cell disease.BACKGROUND: Sickle cell trait (SCT) testing of red blood cell (RBC) units is sometimes performed to identify and divert units containing hemoglobin S (HbS). Recipients strategically guarded against this exposure include fetuses, neonates, and children with sickle cell disease (SCD). The clinical necessity of this practice is unclear. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A one-year audit (2018) was performed at a pediatric tertiary care hospital that tests for SCT in RBC units prescribed to children with SCD and neonates. The impact of incorporating varying numbers of SCT RBC units in a single-unit top-up, partial-manual red cell exchange, and automated erythrocytapheresis was modeled in four typical-parameter age scenarios (2, 5, 10, and 18 years) sharing a high baseline HbS. Additionally, a survey assessing SCT testing practices was administered to Canadian pediatric hospital transfusion laboratories serving hemoglobinopathy programs. RESULTS: Of 2268 donor RBC units tested, one was positive for SCT (0.04% [95% CI: 0.01%-0.24%]), at a cost of $19,384.56 CAD. The impact of SCT unit incorporation on lost HbS reduction was modest (Delta1%-3% [automated erythrocytapheresis] and Delta4%-15% [top-up/partial manual exchange]). The survey (with all 13 sites responding) showed variable SCT testing practice; four (31%) do not test, four (31%) test for children with SCD, and six (46%) test for neonates. CONCLUSION: RBC SCT testing may be more costly than beneficial or necessary in children with SCD. As of 2019, our transfusion service has ceased SCT testing for this population. Further research in the fetal/neonatal populations is needed to overturn this entrenched practice.
33742492		Sickle cell disease and ventricular myocardial strain: A systematic review.Cardiac disease is the primary cause of death in sickle cell disease (SCD). Cardiac abnormalities begin in childhood and progress throughout life. Right and left ventricular (RV, LV) myocardial strain are early markers of systolic dysfunction but are not well investigated among individuals with SCD. The objectives of this review were to (1) identify all published studies that have evaluated ventricular myocardial strain, (2) summarize their values, and (3) compare findings with those obtained from controls. From search results of four electronic databases-Medline, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science-42 potential articles were identified, of which 18 articles and 17 studies met eligibility criteria for inclusion. The evaluated studies demonstrate that RV and LV myocardial strain are generally abnormal in individuals with SCD compared with controls, despite having normal ejection/shortening fraction. Myocardial strain has been inconsistently evaluated in this population and should be considered any time an echocardiogram is performed.
33982194	associate|@CHEMICAL_Creatinine|@DISEASE_Glycosuria_Renal	Utility of measuring serum creatinine to detect renal compromise in ED patients receiving IV contrast-enhanced CT scan.OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study are to determine the efficacy of a roster of clinical factors in identifying risk for renal insufficiency in emergency department (ED) patients requiring intravenous contrast-enhanced CT scan (IVCE-CT) and to help mitigate potential for developing contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN). METHODS: A review was conducted of consecutive ED patients who received IVCE-CT during a 4-month period in our urban ED. The values of ED serum creatinine (SCr) performed were tabulated. The medical records of all patients with an elevated SCr (> 1.4 mg/dL) were reviewed to determine and correlate the presence of clinical risk factors for underlying renal insufficiency. RESULTS: During the 4-month study period, there were 2260 consecutive cases who received IVCE-CT; of these, 2250 (99.6%) had concomitant measurement of SCr. Elevated SCr occurred in 141 patients (6.2%); of these, 75 had a SCr > 2 mg/dL. In all, 139/141 (98.6%) with an elevated SCr had an underlying chronic or acute medical condition identified by medical record review which potentially compromised renal function, including chronic renal disease, diabetes mellitus, HIV infection, cancer, hypertension, congestive heart failure, sepsis/septic shock, chronic alcoholism, and sickle cell disease. Two patients with no identified risk factor each had (mildly) elevated SCr; both had a normal SCr measured post-CT scan. The total cost of performing serum basic metabolic panel to measure SCr in all patients during the 4-month study period was $94,500. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated SCr is rarely present in ED patients without recognized risk factors who receive IVCE-CT scan. The vast majority with underlying renal insufficiency are readily identified by a review of the patient's medical history and/or clinical findings. Routine SCr measurement on all ED patients regardless of risk stratification prior to IVCE imaging is neither time nor cost-effective.
35700397		Transitioning Adolescents With Sickle Cell Disease From Pediatric to Adult Care: Results From a New Survey of Health Care Professionals.Transition from pediatric to adult care for adolescents and young adults (AYA) with sickle cell disease (SCD) comes at a time when a range of biopsychosocial issues occur simultaneously. A new survey sought information from physicians who treat AYA with SCD about their practices in how they transition pediatric patients to adult care. An online survey to physicians who treat SCD was conducted using SurveyMonkey between November 2019 and January 2020. Of 209 physicians who were contacted, 58 completed the survey; 62.1% treated primarily pediatric patients and 37.9% treated adults. Patient education on transition was regarded as "important" or "very important" by 94.2% of the physicians. Patients' knowledge about their disease and their ability to navigate the health care system were identified as 2 primary barriers to transition (mean 1.30 and 1.67 on a 3-point scale, respectively). Most physicians employ established models to facilitate the transition, including Got Transition (41.3%) and a biopsychosocial model (34.8%), with 34.8% using a mix of models and 23.9% not using an established model. Fewer than half (34.8%) rated their program as "very successful" or "successful." Transition protocols from pediatric to adult care should be re-examined to facilitate successful transition for AYA with SCD.

This study aims to describe the results of treosulfan-based conditioning regimens in children, focusing on toxicity and outcomes when used to treat both malignant and non-malignant diseases. METHODS: Retrospective observational study on pediatric patients treated in Spain with treosulfan-based conditioning regimens before hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), based on data collection from electronic clinical records. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty treosulfan-based conditioning HSCTs to treat non-malignant diseases (n=117) or malignant diseases (n=43) in 158 children and adolescents are reported. Median age at HSCT was 5.1 years (IQR: 2-10). The most frequent diagnoses were primary immunodeficiency (n=42; 36%) and sickle cell disease (n=42; 36%) in the non-malignant cohort and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n=15; 35%) in the malignant cohort. Engraftment occurred in 97% of the patients. There was a longer median time to neutrophil engraftment (17 vs. 14 days; p=0.008) and platelet engraftment (20 vs. 15 days; p=0.002) in the non-malignant cohort. The 1-year cumulative incidence of VOD was 7.98 (95%CI [4.6-13.6]), with no significant differences between cohorts. The 1-year cumulative incidence of grade III-IV aGvHD was higher in the malignant cohort (18% vs. 3.2%; p=0.011). Overall, cGvHD was more frequently observed in the malignant cohort for both total incidence (9 vs. 3%; p<0.001) and 2-year cumulative incidence of total cGvHD (16 vs. 1.9%; p<0.001). The 2-year cumulative TRM was 15%, with no differences between cohorts. 5-year Overall Survival was 80% (95%CI [72-86]) and was higher in the non-malignant cohort (87 vs. 61%; p=0.01). The 2-year cumulative incidence of relapse in the malignant cohort was 25%. 5-year cumulative GRFS rate was 60% (95%CI [51-70]) and was higher in the non-malignant cohort (72 vs. 22%; p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The treosulfan-based radiation-free conditioning regimen is feasible, achieving a high engraftment rate and 5-year overall survival. A treosulfan-based conditioning regimen is an emerging option for the first HSCT in non-malignant diseases.
35617049		Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in hospitalized sickle cell disease and sickle cell trait patients.INTRODUCTION: Sickle trait (Hb SA) or sickle disease (Hb SS) carries increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Hb SS patients are young and lack common comorbid conditions that qualify them for VTE prophylaxis (VTEP). METHODS: Retrospective, multicenter analysis of Hb SS/Hb SA adult patients between January 2013 and December 2018. RESULTS: There were 803 Hb SA (525 patients) and 1020 Hb SS admissions (262 patients). VTEP use was similar between Hb SA and controls (42% vs. 46%; p-value = .06) and Hb SS and controls (45% vs. 42%; p-value = .13). Hb SS/Hb SA patients more frequently received more than half of prescribed doses of VTEP. In multivariate analysis, increasing age and longer hospitalizations were positive predictors. Odds of VTEP use varied with treatment site for Hb SS patients, whereas comorbid conditions, admission hemoglobin and platelet count were not predictive. By contrast, in Hb SA patients, comorbid conditions, higher admission hemoglobin, and higher admission platelet counts raised the odds of VTEP being offered. CONCLUSIONS: VTEP is underused in Hb SS/Hb SA patients. There may be a trend toward offering more VTEP in Hb SS disease, but not in Hb SA patients, where VTEP prescribing is driven by comorbid conditions rather than genotype. Patient compliance does not appear to play a major role, but intercenter variability suggests provider education may improve VTEP use.
33779756		Feasibility of Medical Student Mentors to Improve Transition in Sickle Cell Disease.OBJECTIVE: Advances in medical care have resulted in nearly 95% of all children with sickle cell disease (SCD) living to adulthood. There is a lack of effective transition programming, contributing to high rates of mortality and morbidity among adolescents and young adults (AYAs) during the transition from pediatric to adult healthcare. This nonrandomized study evaluated the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary outcomes of a novel medical student mentor intervention to improve transition outcomes for AYA with SCD. METHODS: Eligible participants were ages 18-25 years, either preparing for transition or had transferred to adult care within the past year. Twenty-four AYA with SCD (Mage = 20.3, SD = 2.6) enrolled in the program and were matched with a medical student mentor. Feasibility and acceptability of the intervention was assessed through enrollment rates, reasons for refusal, retention rates, engagement with the intervention, satisfaction, and reasons for drop-out. Dependent t-tests were used to evaluate the preliminary effects of the intervention on patient transition readiness, health-related quality of life, self-efficacy, SCD knowledge, medication adherence, and health literacy. RESULTS: Participants (N = 24) demonstrated adequate retention (75.0%), adherence to the intervention (M = 5.3 of 6 sessions), and satisfaction with the intervention components. Participants demonstrated significant improvements in transition readiness (p = .001), self-efficacy (p = .002), medication adherence (p = .02), and health literacy (p = .05). CONCLUSIONS: A medical student mentor intervention to facilitate transition from pediatric to adult care for AYA with SCD is both feasible and acceptable to patients and medical students. Preliminary results suggest benefits for patients, warranting a larger efficacy study.
37498339		The use of extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) in treating osteonecrosis of the femoral head (AVNFH): a retrospective study.PURPOSE: As most of the cases of avascular necrosis (AVN) in Saudi Arabia is seen in young population and as literature showed good effect of extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) in reducing pain and oedema in avascular necrosis and delaying the need of surgical intervention. Our purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of ESWT in reducing pain, improving range of motion (ROM) and delaying the surgical intervention in patient with AVN of femoral head and compare our results to published literature. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We have treated 24 patients, 13 males and 11 females with a mean age of 29 years (range 14-48) with 34 hips affected. There were 14 unilateral and ten bilateral lesions. In our series 11 out of 24 patients (45.8%) were due to sickle cell disease. Other causes included idiopathic in five patients (20.8%), corticosteroids use and systemic lupus erythematous in three patients each (12.5% each) and post-traumatic AVN in two patients (8.3%). Extracorporeal shock wave therapy was implanted in FICAT stage I, II and III. All patients had two sessions of extracorporeal shock wave therapy, four to six weeks apart, each with 4000 impulses divided into four points. Radiological and MRI assessment were performed at regular time intervals with a minimum follow-up of two years. Clinical assessment was based on Visual Analog Scale and Harris Hip Score (HHS). The end point outcome measurement was the need for any operative intervention. RESULTS: Operative intervention was necessary in eight out of 34 hips (23.5%), within an average of 2.5 years (range 1 to 5 years). A hip salvage was achieved in 76.5%. Function was improved with the Harris Hip Score from a mean of 54.6 to 80.4 (P value using paired t test <= 0.05). Pain assessed with Visual Analog Scale improved from 5.73 to 2.75 (P value using paired t test <= 0.05). CONCLUSION: We do recommend the use of ESWT in treating AVN of bone whether of femoral head or other sites prior to the collapse of the articular surface. Further studies are needed to compare using two or more sessions as well as using four or six points for ESWT.
38037041		Opioid prescriptions among the World Trade Center Health Program population.BACKGROUND: The World Trade Center Health Program (Program) provides limited health care to those directly affected by the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Because of physical/mental trauma arising from the 9/11 attacks, Program members might be at high risk of opioid use. To prevent prescription opioid overuse, in 2018 the Program implemented various measures to improve opioid prescribing and expand access to non-opioid pain management among Program members. However, the characteristics of opioid prescriptions dispensed among this population has never been described. METHODS: Administrative and claims data from 07/01/2011 to 09/30/2022 were used to describe opioid prescriptions dispensed during 2013-2021. RESULTS: From 2013-2021, 108,285 members were Program-enrolled for >= 10 months, 4,053 (3.7%) had 22,938 outpatient opioid prescriptions, of which, 62.1% were for cancer-related pain, 11.1% for hospice/end of life care, 4.8% for surgery pain, and 9.8% for acute/chronic pain. Among members with Program-paid diagnostic/treatment claims (n = 70,721), the proportion with opioid prescriptions for cancer/hospice/end of life care increased from 0.5% in 2013 to 1.6% in 2018 (p = 0.010), then decreased to 1.1% in 2021 (p = 0.070), and the proportion for non-cancer surgery/acute/chronic pain decreased from 0.6% in 2013 to 0.23% in 2021 (p = 0.0005). Among members prescribed opioids without cancer/hospice/sickle cell disease, the proportion who started with long-acting opioids or had opioid prescriptions from >= 4 prescribers were below 6.5% annually; the proportion receiving a high-dose (>= 90 morphine milligram equivalents per day [MED]), or with concurrent opioids and benzodiazepines use, or who started opioids with MED >= 50 or with long duration (>= 7 days' supply) were above 10% annually, but decreased since 2017. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of outpatient opioid prescriptions paid by the Program was very low and prescriptions were primarily dispensed for cancer/hospice/end of life care. Although Program efforts to improve opioid prescribing coincided with improvements in outcomes, ongoing surveillance is needed.
35181561		Reduction in the Prevalence of Thrombotic Events in Sickle Cell Disease after Allogeneic Hematopoietic Transplantation.Thrombosis is a recognized complication in sickle cell disease (SCD). Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) remains the sole curative option for patients with severe SCD phenotypes. Data describing the effects of allo-HCT on recurrent thrombotic events (venous and arterial events) are limited, however. We evaluated 31 patients with SCD who underwent allo-HCT with a median follow-up of 34.5 months (range, 13 to 115) post-transplantation. No patient continued anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy after allo-HCT. There was an absolute difference of 32% (95% confidence interval [CI], 12.3% to 32.2%; P = .002) in the prevalence of venous thromboembolic (VTE) events before and after allo-HSCT. In addition, there was an absolute difference of 38.5% (95% CI, 10.63 to 45.96; P = .006) in the number of ischemic cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) occurring before and after allo-HSCT. Patients with severe SCD who undergo allo-HCT are less likely to develop recurrent thrombotic events compared with a control cohort of patients matched for age and genotype (odds ratio, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.058 to 0.83; P = .025). Following curative therapy with allo-HCT, there is a reduction in recurrent arterial and venous thrombosis in patients with severe SCD phenotypes.
34592567		Evaluation of sex disparities in opioid use among ED patients with sickle cell disease, 2006-2015.BACKGROUND: Acute pain from a vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) is a leading reason patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) visit the emergency department (ED). Prior studies suggest that women and men receive disparate ED treatment for acute pain in EDs. We aim to determine sex differences in analgesic use among patients with SCD presenting to the ED. METHODS: This cross-sectional study uses data from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS), 2006-2015. We identified ED patients with a primary diagnosis of SCD. Among patients with SCD, we evaluated sex differences in the use of opioid analgesia using logistic regression (adjusting for patient and visit characteristics). Analyses accounted for survey design and weighting. RESULTS: When evaluating the effect of sex on any opioid medication use in this population, though not significant, the odds that male patients were prescribed opioids was 1.5 (95% CI 0.8-2.8) times that of female patients after adjusting for age, the reason for visit, region, insurance status, and pain score. There was no significant difference in pain scores between male patients, 8.1 (95% CI 7.55-8.68) compared to female patients, 7.4 (95% CI 6.7-8.12). CONCLUSIONS: In this nationally representative sample of ED visits among patients with SCD, there was no conclusive evidence of sex disparities in opioid prescribing. Though there is evidence of a trend signaling that male patients with SCD were more likely than female patients to be prescribed an opioid.
37318395		A systematic review of clinical trials for gene therapies for beta-hemoglobinopathy around the world.BACKGROUND AIMS: Amidst the success of cell therapy for the treatment of onco-hematological diseases, the first recently Food and Drug Administration-approved gene therapy product for patients with transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia (TDT) indicates the feasibility of gene therapy as curative for genetic hematologic disorders. This work analyzed the current-world scenario of clinical trials involving gene therapy for beta-hemoglobinopathies. METHODS: Eighteen trials for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and 24 for patients with TDT were analyzed. RESULTS: Most are phase 1 and 2 trials, funded by the industry and are currently recruiting volunteers. Treatment strategies for both diseases are fetal hemoglobin induction (52.4%); addition of wild-type or therapeutic beta-globin gene (38.1%) and correction of mutations (9,5%). Gene editing (52.4%) and gene addition (40.5%) are the two most used techniques. The United States and France are the countries with the greatest number of clinical trials centers for SCD, with 83.1% and 4.2%, respectively. The United States (41.1%), China (26%) and Italy (6.8%) lead TDT trials centers. CONCLUSIONS: Geographic trial concentration indicates the high costs of this technology, logistical issues and social challenges that need to be overcome for gene therapy to reach low- and middle-income countries where SCD and TDT are prevalent and where they most impact the patient's health.
33852506		Peripartum considerations in sickle cell disease.PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Pregnancy exacerbates sickle cell disease (SCD) and is associated with increased frequency and severity of complications resulting in high levels of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. We review recent recommendations for managing SCD in pregnancy. RECENT FINDINGS: An updated pathobiological model of SCD now attributes the clinical picture to a vicious cycle of four major cellular disturbances. Management decisions should be guided by an understanding of this upgraded model. Red cell transfusions are a key therapeutic intervention used in managing several acute and chronic complications. Transfusion however has significant drawbacks. The American Society of Hematology recently published transfusion guidelines to support care providers. SUMMARY: Patients should be managed by a multidisciplinary and experienced team. The perioperative episode is a recognized period of disease exacerbation and informed anesthetic management can contribute to improved patient outcomes.
38224366		Enhancing diagnostic precision for acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease: insights from dual-energy CT lung perfusion mapping.PURPOSE: Acute chest syndrome (ACS) is secondary to occlusion of the pulmonary vasculature and a potentially life-threatening complication of sickle cell disease (SCD). Dual-energy CT (DECT) iodine perfusion map reconstructions can provide a method to visualize and quantify the extent of pulmonary microthrombi. METHODS: A total of 102 patients with sickle cell disease who underwent DECT CTPA with perfusion were retrospectively identified. The presence or absence of airspace opacities, segmental perfusion defects, and acute or chronic pulmonary emboli was noted. The number of segmental perfusion defects between patients with and without acute chest syndrome was compared. Sub-analyses were performed to investigate robustness. RESULTS: Of the 102 patients, 68 were clinically determined to not have ACS and 34 were determined to have ACS by clinical criteria. Of the patients with ACS, 82.4% were found to have perfusion defects with a median of 2 perfusion defects per patient. The presence of any or new perfusion defects was significantly associated with the diagnosis of ACS (P = 0.005 and < 0.001, respectively). Excluding patients with pulmonary embolism, 79% of patients with ACS had old or new perfusion defects, and the specificity for new perfusion defects was 87%, higher than consolidation/ground glass opacities (80%). CONCLUSION: DECT iodine map has the capability to depict microthrombi as perfusion defects. The presence of segmental perfusion defects on dual-energy CT maps was found to be associated with ACS with potential for improved specificity and reclassification.
35082243		Identifying and Treating Severe Bone Marrow Necrosis and Fat Embolism Syndrome in Pediatric Patients With Sickle Cell Disease: A Case Report.Fat embolism syndrome after bone marrow necrosis is an extremely rare complication in sickle cell disease associated with significant morbidity and mortality. A high index of suspicion is required for diagnosis. This case report will assist pediatric clinicians and hematologists to recognize this severe complication in patients with sickle cell disease and to promptly initiate treatment. Red flags include severe bone pain, respiratory distress, neurological impairment, decreasing platelet count, peripheral leukocyte left shift, elevated nucleated red blood cells, and significant elevation in plasma ferritin and lactate dehydrogenase. We report a pediatric patient who was diagnosed early, received urgent red cell exchange transfusion and plasma exchange, and ultimately survived this devastating complication.
34986133		Development and Validation of Pediatric Opioid Analgesia Self-Instruction System (PedOASIS): An Opioid Knowledge Tool for Pediatric Clinicians.BACKGROUND: Acute pain is common in children and young adults with cancer and sickle cell disease. Current training curricula fail to adequately impart skills for pain management. We sought to develop and validate an education and assessment tool to address the safe effective use of opioids for pain management by pediatrics trainees. METHODS: The first version of the tool contained 10 case-based, multiple-choice questions. It was pilot tested within a medium-sized pediatric residency program using preintervention and postintervention surveys to assess residents' knowledge and comfort related to prescribing opioids. Content validation was performed through an expert panel of physicians. Internal reliability was tested by administering the tool to learners and practitioners with varying levels of training. RESULTS: Comfort with choosing and converting between opioids increased significantly in pilot testing (P=0.005). Mean objective knowledge scores increased from 51% to 85.9% (P<0.001). The revised tool showed internal reliability within each group (Cronbach alpha 0.71 to 0.78) and significant differences in mean scores between groups (F ratio=9.45, P=0.0002). CONCLUSIONS: This tool demonstrates validity and internal reliability. Its use was associated with short-term educational gains and it garnered overall favorable feedback from users. Further testing is needed to assess the duration of these gains.
36661087		Hospital and ICU Admission Risk Associated With Comorbidities Among Children With COVID-19 Ancestral Strains.A large proportion of children have been affected by COVID-19; we evaluated the association between comorbidities and hospitalization/ICU (intensive care unit) admission among 4097 children under age 21 years with symptomatic COVID-19 (not just polymerase chain reaction [PCR]-positive or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children associated with COVID-19 [MIS-C]) from 2 large health systems from March 2020 to September 2021. Significant comorbidities and demographic factors identified by univariable analysis were included in a multivariable logistic regression compared with children ages 6 to 11 without comorbidities. In all, 475 children (11.6%) were hospitalized, of whom 25.5% required ICU admission. Children under 1 year had high hospitalization risk, but low risk of ICU admission. Presence of at least 1 comorbidity was associated with hospitalization and ICU admission (odds ratio [OR] > 4). Asthma, obesity, chronic kidney disease, sickle cell disease, bone marrow transplantation, and neurologic disorders were associated with hospitalization (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] > 2). Malignancy, intellectual disability, and prematurity were associated with ICU admission (AOR > 4). Comorbidities are significantly associated with hospitalization/ICU admission among children with COVID-19.
36379441		Optimal predelivery hemoglobin to reduce transfusion and adverse perinatal outcomes.BACKGROUND: Maternal anemia has been associated with poor obstetrical outcomes; however, the optimal hemoglobin level for reducing blood transfusion at delivery has not been well-defined. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to measure the association of maternal anemia immediately before delivery with peripartum transfusion and other adverse perinatal outcomes. We also sought to identify the optimal hemoglobin level for predicting transfusion. STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective cohort study of patients who had hemoglobin or hematocrit collected before delivery of live, nonanomalous neonates at >=23 weeks' gestation at a single center (2013-2018). Patients were excluded if they had sickle cell disease or were receiving anticoagulation. Patients were categorized as having anemia or no anemia on the basis of predelivery hemoglobin or hematocrit levels using criteria set by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. The primary outcome was transfusion of >=1 unit of packed red blood cells during the delivery admission. Secondary outcomes included select adverse perinatal outcomes. Bivariable analyses compared baseline characteristics and outcomes between the anemia and no-anemia groups. Multivariable logistic regression estimated the association between anemia and outcomes. The hemoglobin cutoff optimizing sensitivity and specificity for transfusion was identified by the Liu method. RESULTS: Of the 18,357 patients included in the analysis, 5444 (30%) had predelivery anemia (mean hemoglobin, 10.0+-0.8 g/dL) vs 12,913 (70%) who did not (mean hemoglobin, 12.3+-1.1 g/dL). Patients with anemia were more likely to be non-Hispanic Black and publicly insured and less likely to be nulliparous. Anemia was associated with 5-fold higher odds of packed red blood cell transfusion (6.0% vs 1.3%; adjusted odds ratio, 5.23 [95% confidence interval, 4.09-6.69]) compared with no anemia. For each 1 g/dL increase in predelivery hemoglobin, the odds of transfusion were 56% lower (adjusted odds ratio, 0.44 [confidence interval, 0.40-0.48]). The optimal hemoglobin for prediction of transfusion was 10.6 g/dL (sensitivity: 80%, specificity: 86%). There was no association between anemia and composite maternal or neonatal morbidity after adjustment for covariates, but anemia was associated with higher odds of postpartum readmission (adjusted odds ratio, 1.35 [1.11-1.64]). CONCLUSION: Maternal anemia before delivery was associated with 5-fold higher odds of packed red blood cell transfusion and postpartum readmission, but not other perinatal morbidity. Optimizing predelivery hemoglobin, particularly >=10.6 g/dL, may reduce peripartum transfusion.

33626864	treat|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Chronic_Disease ;treat|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Organizing_Pneumonia	Chronic organ injuries in children with sickle cell disease.Median life expectancy of patients with sickle cell disease has increased to up to 55 years but there are still frequent cases of premature death, mostly in patients with pre-existing organ failure such as pulmonary hypertension, kidney injury, and cerebral vasculopathy. Most organ injuries remain asymptomatic for a long time and can only be detected through early systematic screening. Protocols combining assessment of velocities on transcranial Doppler and regular transfusions in patients with abnormal velocities have been demonstrated to dramatically reduce the risk of stroke. In contrast, no consensus has been reached on systematic screening or therapy for silent cerebral infarcts. The prognostic significance of increased tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity on echocardiography has not yet been identified in children, whereas increased albuminuria is a good predictor of kidney injury. Finally, screening for hip and eye disorder is recommended; however, different countries adopt different screening strategies. Hydroxyurea is probably of potential benefit in preventing chronic organ damage but this requires further study in order to be fully demonstrated. Efficacy and safety of the other new drugs available are also under investigation.
37185695		Pediatric brain aneurysms: a review of 1458 brain MR angiograms.PURPOSE: To evaluate clinical and imaging characteristics of pediatric brain aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of 1458 MR angiograms of pediatric patients (<=18 years old) obtained between 2006 and 2021 was performed. A non-infundibular arterial luminal outpouching larger than 1mm in size was identified as an "Intracranial aneurysm." Patient demographics, clinical presentations, and predisposing risk factors, including family history and underlying medical conditions, were reviewed. MRA images were analyzed for aneurysm location, number, maximum diameter, and interval changes on follow-up. RESULTS: Forty-nine (3.3%) patients (30 females, 19 males) with 64 intracranial aneurysms were identified with an average age of 13.71 +- 3.67 years. Eleven (22.4%) patients had multiple aneurysms. An underlying systemic illness was observed in 81.6% (40/49) cases, with sickle cell disease as the most frequent (25/49, 51%) diagnosis. A first-degree family history of intracranial aneurysms was recognized in 36/1458 (2.5%) patients. However, no intracranial aneurysm was found in this group. While 02/49 (4%) patients presented with acute SAH, headache was the most common (16/49, 32.7%) symptom at presentation in unruptured cases. The majority (47/64, 73.4%) of the aneurysms were located in the anterior circulation, with the ICA ophthalmic segment being most frequently (24/47, 51%) involved. Most (54/64, 84.4%) aneurysms were smaller than 4mm in size at the time of diagnosis. At least one follow-up MRA was obtained in 72.3% (34/47) of the unruptured aneurysms cohort. There was no change in the aneurysm size and morphology in 31/34 (91.2 %) patients over an average imaging follow-up of 39.6 months. Three (6%) patients demonstrated an interval increase in the aneurysm size. SAH patients (n=2) and two unruptured aneurysm patients with an interval increase in size were successfully treated with endovascular techniques. CONCLUSION: Female predominance with a higher frequency of small and unruptured intracranial aneurysms was recognized in our cohort. A higher incidence of an underlying systemic illness, especially sickle cell disease, was also noted. Most intracranial aneurysms in children appear to remain stable. However, there seems to be the risk of an aneurysm size increase which warrants regular clinical and imaging follow-up.
35077595	associate|@CHEMICAL_Acetazolamide|@CHEMICAL_Oxygen ;associate|@CHEMICAL_Oxygen|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell	Comparative Analysis of Blood T2 Values Measured by T2 -TRIR and TRUST.BACKGROUND: Venous blood oxygenation (Yv), which can be derived from venous blood T2 (T2 b), combined with oxygen-extraction fraction (OEF) and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen, is considered indicative for tissue viability and brain functioning and frequently assessed in patients with sickle cell disease. Recently, T2 -Prepared-Blood-Relaxation-Imaging-with-Inversion-Recovery (T2 -TRIR) was introduced allowing for simultaneous measurements of blood T2 and T1 (T1 b), potentially improving Yv estimation by overcoming the need to estimate hematocrit. PURPOSE: To optimize and compare T2 -TRIR with T2 -relaxation-under-spin-tagging (TRUST) sequence. STUDY TYPE: Prospective. POPULATION: A total of 12 healthy volunteers (six female, 27 +- 3 years old) and 7 patients with sickle cell disease (five female, 32 +- 12 years old). FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 3 T; turbo field echo planar imaging (TFEPI), echo planar imaging (EPI), and fast field echo (FFE). ASSESSMENT: T2 b, Yv, and OEF from TRUST and T2 -TRIR were compared and T2 -TRIR-derived T1 b was assessed. Within- and between-session repeatability was quantified in the controls, whereas sensitivity to hemodynamic changes after acetazolamide (ACZ) administration was assessed in the patients. STATISTICAL TESTS: Shapiro-Wilk, one-sample and paired-sample t-test, repeated measures ANOVA, mixed linear model, Bland-Altman analysis and correlation analysis. Sidak multiple-comparison correction was performed. Significance level was 0.05. RESULTS: In controls, T2 b from T2 -TRIR (70 +- 11 msec) was higher compared to TRUST (60 +- 8 msec). In patients, T2 b values were lower pre- compared to post-ACZ administration (TRUST: 80 +- 15 msec and 106 +- 23 msec and T2 -TRIR: 95 +- 21 msec and 125 +- 36 msec). Consequently, Yv and OEF were lower and higher pre- compared to post-ACZ administration (TRUST Yv: 68% +- 7% and 77% +- 8%, T2 -TRIR Yv: 74% +- 8% and 80% +- 6%, TRUST OEF: 30% +- 7% and 21% +- 8%, and T2 -TRIR OEF: 25% +- 8% and 18% +- 6%). DATA CONCLUSION: TRUST and T2 -TRIR are reproducible, but T2 -TRIR-derived T2 b values are significantly higher compared to TRUST, resulting in higher Yv and lower OEF estimates. This bias might be considered when evaluating cerebral oxygen homeostasis. EVIDENCE LEVEL: 2 TECHNICAL EFFICACY: Stage 2.
36782158	negative_correlate|@CHEMICAL_methyl_beta_cyclodextrin|@CHEMICAL_Cholesterol ;associate|@CHEMICAL_methyl_beta_cyclodextrin|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell	Atomic force microscopy reveals involvement of the cell envelope in biomechanical properties of sickle erythrocytes.BACKGROUND: Intracellular hemoglobin polymerization has been supposed to be the major determinant for the elevated rigidity/stiffness of sickle erythrocytes from sickle cell anemia (SCA) patients. However, the contribution of the cell envelope remains unclear. RESULTS: In this study, using atomic force microscopy (AFM), we compared the normal and sickled erythrocyte surfaces for stiffness and topography. AFM detected that sickle cells had a rougher surface and were stiffer than normal erythrocytes and that sickle cell ghosts had a rougher surface (for both outer and inner surfaces) and were thicker than normal ghosts, the latter implying a higher membrane-associated hemoglobin content/layer in the sickle cell envelope. Compared to healthy subjects, the SCA patients had lower plasma lipoprotein levels. AFM further revealed that a mild concentration of methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MbetaCD, a putative cholesterol-depleting reagent) could induce an increase in roughness of erythrocytes/ghosts and a decrease in thickness of ghosts for both normal and sickle cells, implying that MbetaCD can alter the cell envelope from outside (cholesterol in the plasma membrane) to inside (membrane-associated hemoglobin). More importantly, MbetaCD also caused a more significant decrease in stiffness of sickle cells than that of normal erythrocytes. CONCLUSIONS: The data reveal that besides the cytosolic hemoglobin fibers, the cell envelope containing the membrane-associated hemoglobin also is involved in the biomechanical properties (e.g., stiffness and shape maintenance) of sickle erythrocytes.
35094801		Health State Utilities for Sickle Cell Disease: A Catalog Prepared From a Systematic Review.OBJECTIVES: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a complex, chronic condition that impairs health-related quality of life of affected individuals and their caregivers. As curative therapies emerge, comprehensive cost-effectiveness models will inform their value. These models will require descriptions of health states and their corresponding utility values that accurately reflect health-related quality of life over the disease trajectory. The objectives of this systematic review were to develop a catalog of health state utility (HSU) values for SCD, identify research gaps, and provide future directions for preference elicitation. METHODS: Records were identified through searches of PubMed and Embase, Tufts Medical Center Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry, reference lists of relevant articles, and consultation with SCD experts (2008-2020). We removed duplicate records and excluded ineligible studies. For included studies, we summarized the study characteristics, methods used for eliciting HSUs, and HSU values. RESULTS: Five studies empirically elicited utilities using indirect methods (EQ-5D) (n = 3) and Short Form-6 Dimension (n = 2); these represent health states associated with general SCD (n = 1), SCD complications (n = 2), and SCD treatments (n = 3). Additionally, we extracted HSUs from 7 quality-adjusted life-years-based outcome research studies. The HSU among patients with general SCD without specifying complications ranged from 0.64 to 0.887. Only 36% of the HSUs used in the quality-adjusted life-year-based outcomes research studies were derived from individuals with SCD. No study estimated HSUs in caregivers. CONCLUSIONS: There is a dearth of literature of HSUs for use in SCD models. Future empirical studies should elicit a comprehensive set of HSUs from individuals with SCD and their caregivers.
38302120		Comprehensive Care in Sickle Cell Disease.Despite advancements in sickle cell disease (SCD) management, individuals with SCD continue to face greater degrees of mortality, disability, and health care barriers compared with their healthy peers. Comprehensive care includes essential elements such as newborn screening, key immunizations, penicillin prophylaxis, and consistent health screening for common complications. Pediatricians should be familiar with treatment options for SCD to offer informed education to both patients and their families. By providing guided and comprehensive care, pediatricians have the potential to enhance both the quantity and quality of life for individuals living with SCD. [Pediatr Ann. 2024;53(2):e43-e46.].
34732575	treat|@CHEMICAL_Polylactic_Acid_Polyglycolic_Acid_Copolymer|@DISEASE_X_Linked_Combined_Immunodeficiency_Diseases ;associate|@CHEMICAL_Polylactic_Acid_Polyglycolic_Acid_Copolymer|@CHEMICAL_Peptide_Nucleic_Acids	Peptide nucleic acid-dependent artifact can lead to false-positive triplex gene editing signals.Triplex gene editing relies on binding a stable peptide nucleic acid (PNA) sequence to a chromosomal target, which alters the helical structure of DNA to stimulate site-specific recombination with a single-strand DNA (ssDNA) donor template and elicits gene correction. Here, we assessed whether the codelivery of PNA and donor template encapsulated in Poly Lactic-co-Glycolic Acid (PLGA)-based nanoparticles can correct sickle cell disease and x-linked severe combined immunodeficiency. However, through this process we have identified a false-positive PCR artifact due to the intrinsic capability of PNAs to aggregate with ssDNA donor templates. Here, we show that the combination of PNA and donor templates but not either agent alone results in different degrees of aggregation that result in varying but highly reproducible levels of false-positive signal. We have identified this phenomenon in vitro and confirmed that the PNA sequences producing the highest supposed correction in vitro are not active in vivo in both disease models, which highlights the importance of interrogating and eliminating carryover of ssDNA donor templates in assessing various gene editing technologies such as PNA-mediated gene editing.
34931750		Point-of-care lung ultrasound is more reliable than chest X-ray for ruling out acute chest syndrome in sickle cell pediatric patients: A prospective study.BACKGROUND: Acute chest syndrome (ACS) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in sickle cell patients, and it is often challenging to establish its diagnosis. PROCEDURE: This was a prospective observational study conducted in a pediatric emergency (PEM) department. We aimed to investigate the performance characteristics of point-of-care lung ultrasound (LUS) for diagnosing ACS in sickle cell children. LUS by trained PEM physicians was performed and interpreted as either positive or negative for consolidation. LUS results were compared to chest X-ray (CXR) and discharge diagnosis as reference standards. RESULTS: Four PEM physicians performed the LUS studies in 79 suspected ACS cases. The median age was 8 years (range 1-17 years). Fourteen cases (18%) received a diagnosis of ACS based on CXR and 21 (26.5%) had ACS discharge diagnosis. Comparing to CXR interpretation as the reference standard, LUS had a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI: 77%-100%), specificity of 68% (95% CI: 56%-79%), positive predictive value of 40% (95% CI: 24%-56%), and negative predictive value of 100% (95% CI: 92%-100%). Overall LUS accuracy was 73.42% (95% CI: 62%-83%). Using discharge diagnosis as the endpoint for both CXR and LUS, LUS had significantly higher sensitivity (100% vs. 62%, p = .0047) and lower specificity (76% vs.100%, p = .0002). LUS also had lower positive (60% vs.100%, p < .0001) and higher negative (100% vs.77%, p = .0025) predictive values. The overall accuracy was similar for both tests (82% vs. 88%, p = .2593). CONCLUSION: The high negative predictive value, with narrow CIs, makes LUS an excellent ruling-out tool for ACS.
34294508	treat|@CHEMICAL_Levonorgestrel|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell	Provider Attitudes, Preferences, and Practices Regarding Sexual and Reproductive Health for Adolescents and Young Adults With Sickle Cell Disease.PURPOSE: With improvements in life expectancy, adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with sickle cell disease (SCD) increasingly face sexual and reproductive health (SRH) concerns. As subspecialists often serve as primary care providers for those with chronic disease, this study examines pediatric SCD providers' practices and attitudes related to SRH of AYA women with SCD. METHODS: We developed an adapted survey to identify SCD provider attitudes and practices in addressing menses, sexual activity, contraception, and pregnancy for their female patients. We electronically distributed this survey to the American Society of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology SCD interest group. We used descriptive statistics to analyze results. RESULTS: A total of 78 pediatric SCD providers completed the survey. A majority (95%) rated SRH discussions as moderately important or higher, with 89% agreeing this care should be standardized. Most respondents reported discussing SRH, such as menses (78%), teratogenic medications (61%), and contraception (90%), with their female patients with SCD at least annually. Although most refer AYAs with SCD for birth control (83%), 39% endorsed a preferred method, with 33% of these favoring levonorgestrel intrauterine devices in this population and 40% injectable contraception. Approximately half of respondents (57%) reported that the use of combined hormonal contraceptives was unacceptable despite published guidelines that support potential benefits outweighing theoretical risk in AYAs with SCD. CONCLUSIONS: The range of SRH conversations and contraceptive recommendations for AYAs from pediatric SCD providers is broad. SCD providers and AYAs with SCD would benefit from improved evidence and educational resources related to contraception as well as coordinated SRH counseling.
34881428		Perinatal outcomes in women with sickle cell disease: a matched cohort study from London, UK.There are limited data on contemporary outcomes for women with sickle cell disease (SCD) in pregnancy. We conducted a single-site matched cohort study, comparing 131 pregnancies to women with SCD between 2007 and 2017 to a comparison group of 1310 pregnancies unaffected by SCD. Restricting our analysis to singleton pregnancies that reached 24 weeks of gestation, we used conditional Poisson regression to estimate adjusted risk ratios (aRRs) for perinatal outcomes. Infants born to mothers with SCD were more likely to be small for gestational age [aRR 1 69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1 13-2 48], preterm (aRR 2 62, 95% CI 1 82-3 78) and require Neonatal Unit (NNU) admission (aRR 3 59, 95% CI 2 18-5 90). Pregnant women with SCD were at higher risk of pre-eclampsia/eclampsia (aRR 3 53, 95% CI 2 00-6 24), more likely to receive induction of labour (aRR 2 50, 95% CI 1 82-1 76) and caesarean birth (aRR 1 44, 95% CI 1 18-1 76). In analysis stratified by genotype, the risk of adverse outcomes was highest in haemoglobin SS (HbSS) pregnancies (n = 80). There was no strong evidence that haemoglobin SC (HbSC) pregnancies (n = 46) were at higher risk of preterm birth, caesarean delivery, or NNU admission. Pre-eclampsia/eclampsia was more frequently observed in HbSC pregnancies. Despite improvements in the care of pregnant women with SCD, the increased risk of adverse perinatal outcomes remains.
36261305		A Novel Measure of Pain Location in Adults with Sickle Cell Disease.BACKGROUND: Pain intensity remains a primary focus clinically for sickle cell disease pain assessment despite the fact that pain quality and pain location and distribution are critical for clinical diagnosis and treatment of its etiology. However, in part because of measurement issues, scant evidence is available about pain location or its relationship to intensity and quality in adults with SCD. AIM: Our study aim was to examine sickle cell disease pain location for relationships with pain quality and intensity measured in outpatient and inpatient settings. METHODS: We used an existing longitudinal dataset prospectively collected with the valid and reliable tablet-based PAINReportIt(R). Adults with sickle cell disease (n = 99) reported pain location, intensity, and quality during a routine outpatient clinic visit and again during a subsequent hospitalization. From their digital body outline drawings and using the ImageJ software, we computed the pain-affected body surface area. With Pearson's correlations and paired t tests, we examined relationships between pain-affected body surface area and other pain variables across outpatient and inpatient visits. RESULTS: The mean pain-affected body surface area was 14.4% +- 15.0% of the total body surface area for outpatient visits (min-max: 0.0%-90.2%) and 13.5% +- 14.7% (min-max: 0.0%-73.0%) for inpatient stay. Pain-affected body surface area was positively correlated with pain quality scores for both visits but not significantly correlated with pain intensity at either visit. Compared with the outpatient visit, mean pain intensity for inpatient stay was higher (p < .001); pain quality (p = .12) and pain-affected body surface area (p = .60) did not differ significantly between visits. CONCLUSIONS: Unknown is the explanation for pain-affected body surface area association with SCD pain quality but not pain intensity at outpatient and inpatient visits. Additional research is warranted to explore these findings and examine the clinical utility of pain-affected body surface area for chronic sickle cell disease pain and acute sickle cell disease crisis pain.
36705266	treat|@CHEMICAL_Polysaccharides|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell	Immunological efficacy of pneumococcal vaccination including the 13-valent pneumococcal vaccine in adult patients with sickle-cell disease: results of the randomized DREVAC controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Patients with sickle-cell disease (SCD) are at high risk for invasive pneumococcal diseases. The immunological efficacy of 13-valent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine (PCV13) followed by a 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) is poorly documented in adults with SCD. METHODS: This was a randomized open-labelled phase 2 study of the immunogenicity of PCV13 at week (W)0, followed by PPSV23 at W4, compared to PPSV23 alone at W4 in adult patients with SCD. The proportion of responders (four-fold increase of serotype-specific IgG antibodies) to at least 10-shared serotypes was assessed at W8. Secondary endpoints were: i) geometrical mean titers (GMTs), ii) responders to 0-1, 2-5, 6-9, and 10-12 serotypes, iii) pneumococcal opsonophagocytic (OPA) activity, and iv) response durability at W24 and W96. RESULTS: In total, 128 patients were randomized in the PCV13/PPSV23 (n=63) or PPSV23-alone groups (n=65). At W8, 24.56% and 8.20% of patients from the PCV13/PPSV23 and PPSV23 groups, respectively, reached the primary endpoint (p=0.016). These numbers were 36.2% and 8.7% for OPA responders (p=0.002). A combined PCV13/PPSV23 strategy improved the breadth of responses to 0-1, 2-5, 6-9, and 10-12 serotypes with 15.8%, 35%, 24.6%, and 24.6% versus 52.5%, 31%, 8%, and 8% in the PPSV23 group. At W96, GMTs were significantly higher in the PCV13/PPSV23 than in the PPSV23 alone group for five serotypes (4, 14, 19A, 19F, 23F). CONCLUSIONS: A PCV13/PPSV23 regimen improved the breadth and magnitude of antibody responses against a large range of pneumococcal serotypes in adults with SCD. The sustainability of the immune response requires recall strategies.Clinical Trial Registration: NCT02274415.
35180761	treat|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Liver_Diseases ;treat|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell	Introduction of Hydroxyurea Therapy to a Cohort of Sickle Cell Patients in Northern Haiti.Although the prevalence of sickle cell anemia is high in Haiti, treatment with hydroxyurea (HU) is uncommon. HU therapy was started at a hospital in Northern Haiti for children and young adults who had presented with complications of their disease. The patients were followed in clinic for their response to therapy and the principal outcome was hospitalization for complications. There was a 70% decrease in the rate of hospitalization in the cohort with no significant complications or deaths during the study period. Treatment with HU is a proven therapy that reduces the morbidity associated with sickle cell anemia and efforts should be made to assure access and affordability in regions with a high prevalence.

35810055	associate|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell|@GENE_HBB ;treat|@CHEMICAL_Oxygen|@DISEASE_Acute_Chest_Syndrome	[Acute chest syndrome in adult sickle cell patients].Sickle cell disease is a frequent genetic condition, due to a mutation of the beta-globin gene, leading to the production of an abnormal S hemoglobin and characterized by multiple vaso-occlusive events. The acute chest syndrome is a severe complication associated with a significant disability and mortality. It is defined by the association of one or more clinical respiratory manifestations and a new infiltrate on lung imaging. Its pathophysiology is complex and implies vaso-occlusive phenomena (pulmonary vascular thrombosis, fat embolism), infection, and alveolar hypoventilation. S/S or S/beta0-thalassemia genotype, a history of vaso-occlusive crisis or acute chest syndrome, a low F hemoglobin level (<5%), a high steady-state hemoglobin level (> 10 g/dL), or a high steady-state leukocytosis (>10 G/L) are the main risk factors. Febrile chest pain, dyspnea, sometimes cough with expectorations are its main clinical manifestations, and bi-basal crackles are found at auscultation. Inferior alveolar opacities with or without pleural effusions are identified on chest X-ray or CT-scan. Management of the acute chest syndrome should be prompt and implies, besides the recognition of severity signs, a multimodal analgesia, oxygen supplementation, sometimes a parenteral antibiotic treatment and the frequent use of blood transfusions especially in the most severe cases. Prevention is important and includes a regular monitoring of hospitalized patients and the use of incentive spirometry.
37948742		ATYPICAL FOVEAL AND PARFOVEAL ABNORMALITIES IN SICKLE CELL DISEASE.PURPOSE: The primary aim was to describe patterns of para macular involvement, not yet reported but that OCT-A can now detect in SCD patients. The secondary aim was to search arguments concerning the physio pathogeny of para macular involvement. METHODS: This institutional cohort retrospective study was conducted in a Referral Center for Ophthalmological Rare Diseases. Follow-up included an ophthalmological examination with optical coherent tomography and optical coherent tomography angiography. RESULTS: Hundred and thirty-two sickle cell patients were included. Typical sickle cell maculopathy was observed in temporal area in 84 eyes (40.0 %) of SS patients and 8 eyes (14.8 %) of SC patients (p < 0.001). Enlargement of the foveal avascular zone was observed in 10 eyes whom 8 of SS patients. Two atypical parafoveal abnormalities were found in SS patients only. The first one consisted in macular thinning with normal vascularization in 15 eyes of 11 patients. The second atypical maculopathy was large areas of loss of vascularization without retina thinning 10 eyes of six patients. Multivariate analysis did not show a statistically significant relation between the PSR stage and the different type of sickle cell maculopathy (p = 0.21). CONCLUSION: Those atypical sickle cell maculopathy may correspond to early forms preceding a typical SCM. This would point towards several physiopathogenic mechanisms. The first one included the existence of ischemia which can be related to anemia. Presence of retinal thinning without vascular involvement point out to a neurogenic mechanism.
35659126	cause|@CHEMICAL_Iron|@DISEASE_Iron_Overload ;cause|@CHEMICAL_Iron|@DISEASE_Liver_Cirrhosis	Liver Transplantation After Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant for the Treatment of Sickle Cell Disease: A Case Report.Sickle cell anemia is the most common of the hemoglobinopathies, in which the abnormal hemoglobin formed in deoxygenation states undergoes a polymerization process with consequent erythrocyte deformation and vaso-occlusive events. The need for multiple blood transfusions, prolonged ineffective erythropoiesis, hemolysis, and increased iron absorption can cause iron overload in the liver, leading to liver fibrosis. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is currently the only treatment with a curative potential for this disease and can establish normal complete or partial donor-derived erythropoiesis and stabilize or restore function in affected organs, preventing further deterioration of function. However, it does not reverse preexisting liver fibrosis and siderosis. One of the possible complications of patients who undergo HSCT is chronic liver disease, which has a multifactorial cause, with iron overload being an important factor. In the long term, the prevalence of chronic liver disease in HSCT patients, including cirrhosis and its complications, can be significant. Solid organ transplantation after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation for end-organ failure remains a very rare event. It may offer a valuable treatment strategy in selected recipients, although it is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. We report the case of a patient with sickle cell anemia who underwent HSCT and developed severe liver dysfunction requiring liver transplantation 13 years after the procedure. We found no previous report in the literature of orthotopic liver transplant after HCT for the treatment of sickle cell disease.
37420139		Clinical significance of mutational variants in beta and alpha genes in patients with hemoglobinopathies from two large Greek centers: a complex interplay between genotype and phenotype.Hemoglobinopathies affect patients in the wider Mediterranean area consisting of 4 distinct subgroups: beta thalassemia major (TM), beta thalassemia intermedia (TI), sickle cell disease (SCD) and hemoglobin H disease (alpha thalassemia). The clinical spectrum varies from mild to severe. Complex interactions between genes and environmental factors form the clinical manifestations. There is an unmet need to clarify these multifactorial mechanisms. This is the first Greek study describing mutational alleles (HBB and HBA1/HBA2 gene variants) in 217 patients with hemoglobinopathies of two large centers in Greece (Larissa and Athens) and associating particular genotypes or gene variants with clinical manifestations (transfusion frequency, complications). Thus, the complex interplay between corresponding genotypes and phenotypes was investigated. Our results are in accordance with previous national studies with limited variations, due to regional prevalence of specific gene variants, as expected. It is also a description of the prevalence of hemoglobinopathies in the Greek population. The type and prevalence of beta and alpha globin gene variants differ significantly among countries. We also confirm the well-known observation of many studies that in our beta thalassemic or SCD patients, co-inheritance of variants in the alpha globin genes, leading to absence or reduction of alpha globin synthesis were associated with milder clinical course, whereas the inheritance of additional alpha genes (triplication) led to a more severe clinical phenotype. In cases in whom the genotype and phenotype did not correlate, factors like the function or modification of possible regulatory genes or additional nutritional-environmental effects should be investigated. KEY MESSAGES:   This is the first Greek study, fully molecularly defining the beta and alpha mutational alleles in 217 patients with hemoglobinopathies of two large centers in Greece and correlating particular genotypes or gene variants with clinical manifestations (transfusion frequency, complications).   In the beta thalassemic or SCD patients of our cohort, co-inheritance of variants in the alpha globin genes, leading to absence or reduction of alpha globin synthesis were associated with milder clinical course (confirmation of a well-known previous observation).   The inheritance of additional alpha genes (triplication) led to a more severe clinical phenotype (confirmation of a well known previous observation).   The function or modification of possible regulatory genes should be investigated in cases in whom the genotype and phenotype did not correlate.
33632759		Mortality and Access to Kidney Transplantation in Patients with Sickle Cell Disease-Associated Kidney Failure.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Patients with sickle cell disease-associated kidney failure have high mortality, which might be lowered by kidney transplantation. However, because they show higher post-transplant mortality compared with patients with other kidney failure etiologies, kidney transplantation remains controversial in this population, potentially limiting their chance of receiving transplantation. We aimed to quantify the decrease in mortality associated with transplantation in this population and determine the chance of receiving transplantation with sickle cell disease as the cause of kidney failure as compared with other etiologies of kidney failure. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Using a national registry, we studied all adults with kidney failure who began maintenance dialysis or were added to the kidney transplant waiting list in 1998-2017. To quantify the decrease in mortality associated with transplantation, we measured the absolute risk difference and hazard ratio for mortality in matched pairs of transplant recipients versus waitlisted candidates in the sickle cell and control groups. To compare the chance of receiving transplantation, we estimated hazard ratios for receiving transplantation in the sickle cell and control groups, treating death as a competing risk. RESULTS: Compared with their matched waitlisted candidates, 189 transplant recipients with sickle cell disease and 220,251 control recipients showed significantly lower mortality. The absolute risk difference at 10 years post-transplant was 20.3 (98.75% confidence interval, 0.9 to 39.8) and 19.8 (98.75% confidence interval, 19.2 to 20.4) percentage points in the sickle cell and control groups, respectively. The hazard ratio was also similar in the sickle cell (0.57; 95% confidence interval, 0.36 to 0.91) and control (0.54; 95% confidence interval, 0.53 to 0.55) groups (interaction P=0.8). Nonetheless, the sickle cell group was less likely to receive transplantation than the controls (subdistribution hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% confidence interval, 0.61 to 0.87). Similar disparities were found among waitlisted candidates (subdistribution hazard ratio, 0.62; 95% confidence interval, 0.53 to 0.72). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with sickle cell disease-associated kidney failure exhibited similar decreases in mortality associated with kidney transplantation as compared with those with other kidney failure etiologies. Nonetheless, the sickle cell population was less likely to receive transplantation, even after waitlist registration.
35927947	treat|@CHEMICAL_Alemtuzumab|@DISEASE_Graft_vs_Host_Disease ;treat|@CHEMICAL_Sirolimus|@DISEASE_Graft_vs_Host_Disease	Pulmonary function in children and adolescents with sickle cell disease after nonmyeloablative hematopoietic cell transplantation.BACKGROUND: Pulmonary complications are common in sickle cell disease (SCD). The use of standard myeloablative conditioning regimens may increase the risk of lung injury. We report serial pulmonary function testing (PFT) outcomes in children with SCD who underwent a matched-sibling donor hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) using nonmyeloablative (NMA) protocol. METHODS: This is a retrospective chart review describing pulmonary outcomes in pediatric patients post HCT. The conditioning regimen consisted of alemtuzumab and a single fraction of 300 cGy of total body irradiation (TBI), and sirolimus for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. Serial PFT testing was performed pre and post HCT. The evaluated pulmonary measures included: forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1 ), FEV1 /FVC, and forced expiratory flow (FEF25-75 ). RESULTS: Twelve subjects were included in the analysis. All had HbSS genotype, and five of the 12 patients had one or more episodes of acute chest syndrome prior to HCT. Serial PFT measures were completed per patient. No patient was diagnosed with chronic GVHD of any organ post HCT. The baseline median FVC, FEV1 , FEV1 /FVC, and FEF25-75 were within the normal range and remained relatively unchanged post HCT. A linear mixed effects model, adjusting for gender and time from HCT, suggested no significant relationship between HCT and PFT parameters, including FVC, FEV1 , and FEV1 /FVC. Interestingly, the FEF25-75 results exhibited a shift in the means post HCT (pre-HCT 86.2% predicted and post-HCT 93.05% predicted, p-value = .018). CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that HCT in children with SCD may prevent the anticipated decline in pulmonary function over time.
34263922		Fluid overload due to intravenous fluid therapy for vaso-occlusive crisis in sickle cell disease: incidence and risk factors.Intravenous fluid therapy (IV-FT) is routinely used in the treatment of vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs), as dehydration possibly promotes and sustains erythrocyte sickling. Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) are at risk of developing diastolic dysfunction and fluid overload due to IV-FT. However, data on the adverse effects of IV-FT for VOC is sparse. We aimed to evaluate the incidence and risk factors of fluid overload due to IV-FT in patients with SCD. Consecutive hospitalisations for VOC treated with IV-FT between September 2016 and September 2018 were retrospectively analysed. The median (interquartile range) age was 25 0 (18 3-33 8) years and 65% had a severe genotype (HbSS/HbSbeta0 -thal). Fluid overload occurred in 21% of 100 patients. Hospital stay was longer in patients with fluid overload (6 0 vs. 4 0 days, P = 0 037). A positive history of fluid overload (P = 0 017), lactate dehydrogenase level (P = 0 011), and top-up transfusion during admission (P = 0 005) were independently associated with fluid overload occurrence. IV-FT was not reduced in 86% of patients despite a previous history of fluid overload. Fluid overload is frequently encountered during IV-FT for VOC. IV-FT is often not adjusted despite a positive history of fluid overload or when top-up transfusion is indicated, emphasising the need for more awareness of this complication and a personalised approach.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 156 SCD subjects. Serum Creatinine (mg/dl) and Urea (mg/dl) as well as Microalbuminuria (mg/l) level were measured by using Biosystems kit (Biosystems, Barcelona, Spain) and Mindary BA88A semi-automated biochemistry analyzer. Glomerular filtration rate and body mass index were calculated by equations. Blood DNA extraction was achieved by using the modified G-DEX IIb Genomic DNA Extraction Kit protocol. The PCR was done for the detection of the APOL1 G2 rs60910145 alleles by using allele-specific PCR and primers. RESULTS: The CC allele was more frequent in study cases (66.7%) than TT allele. The frequency of a mutated allele (CC) was insignificantly higher in males (67.8%) than in females (65.2%) and in rural (70.9%) than urban areas. It is also higher in Shankhab compared to other tribes and subjects 26-37 years compared to other, P 0.05. Interstingly, the subjects who carry the CC allele showed a significantly higher level of Microalbuminuria, Creatinine, BMI, and Urea compared to those carry TT allele. Moreover, GFR is also higher in subjects who carry CC than TT allele but it is not significant. CONCULSION: Altogether, the study findings highlighted the link of normal and mutated APOL1 G2 rs60910145 alleles with SCD and displayed the significant value of mutated APOL1 allele in the prediction of early nephropathy in SCD patients.
36441603		Impact of magnetic resonance angiography parameters on stroke prevention therapy in pediatric patients with sickle cell anemia.BACKGROUND: Degree of cerebrovascular stenosis in pediatric patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA) informs need for chronic transfusion therapy, which has significant risks. Flow artifact, intrinsic to magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), is dependent on technical parameters and can lead to overinterpretation of stenosis. The primary objective of this study was to document any change in stroke prevention therapy that could be attributed to the implementation of a standardized MRA scanning protocol for patients with SCA. METHODS: A standardized MRA scanning protocol with an echo time of less than 5 ms was implemented at Montefiore Medical Center (MMC), NY in May 2016. Retrospective chart review identified 21 pediatric patients with SCA, with an MRA head both pre- and post-May 2016. Arterial stenosis on MRA, machine parameters, and treatment plans were compared pre- and post-implementation. RESULTS: Ten of the 21 patients met inclusion criteria. Previously seen stenosis was re-classified to a lower degree in six of the 10 patients, leading to discontinuation of transfusions in five patients. No patients required escalation of therapy to chronic transfusions. CONCLUSION: Optimizing flow artifact by decreasing echo time to less than 5 ms can improve accurate interpretation of cerebrovascular disease, and ensure appropriate treatment plans are in place for stroke prevention. This is especially important for implementing "TCD With Transfusions Changing to Hydroxyurea (TWiTCH)" clinical trial results in the real-world setting.
37169288	associate|@DISEASE_Ovarian_Diseases|@GENE_AMH ;cause|@CHEMICAL_Cyclophosphamide|@DISEASE_Gonadal_Disorders	Female Reproductive Health Outcomes after Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation for Sickle Cell Disease: Is Reduced Intensity Better Than Myeloablative Conditioning?Curative therapy for sickle cell disease (SCD) through hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is associated with a high level of risk for treatment-related gonadal dysfunction and future infertility. Both the myeloablative conditioning (MAC) and reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens used for SCD HCT are considered to carry a high risk for ovarian damage. Cyclophosphamide equivalent doses (CEDs) are thought to correlate with the degree of gonadal damage in pediatric oncology patients. We aimed to evaluate ovarian outcomes previously reported from our center, characterize the conditioning regimens as MAC or RIC, and calculate the CED for each regimen. The ovarian outcomes diminished ovarian reserve (DOR), as determined by an anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) below the normal limits for age and assay or <5%, and premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), defined as a follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level >40 mIU/ML, are presented by conditioning regimen from 3 clinical studies from our center (2 published and 1 presented as an abstract in 2022). The studies were not mutually exclusive of patients. CEDs were calculated for each regimen. The CED ranged from 3388 to 9705 mg/m2 for MAC regimens and from 5600 to 18,750 mg/m2 for RIC regimens. DOR was observed in all regimens; however, in one study 2 patients had normal AMH levels after a fludarabine/melphalan regimen, and 1 patient had a normal AMH level after a fludarabine/melphalan/thiotepa regimen. Rates of POI were more variable and ranged from 40% to 100% after MAC regimens and from 0 to 100% after RIC regimens. Female patients with SCD who undergo HCT have very high rates of DOR after both MAC HCT and RIC HCT. Two of the 3 RIC regimens evaluated had higher CEDs than were seen in any of the MAC regimens evaluated. Rates of POI were more variable but may increase with time from transplantation. All SCD patients need to be counseled about the risk of infertility and provided information about fertility preservation.

34116933		Taking therapeutic apheresis services to patients in South Africa: An eight year review of SANBS mobile therapeutic apheresis service, 2013-2020.INTRODUCTION: A 20 year review of health and health care presents the multiple challenges faced by South Africans. Health and poverty is highlighted with 45% of population living on approximately US$ 2 per day and 10 million living on less than US$ 1 per day. Widening disparities in health care provision between public and private sector hospital services exist. The South African population includes the largest number of people living with HIV infection/AIDS of any country in the world, with a 70% estimate of 7.5 million people living with HIV on antiretroviral therapy. The South African National Blood Service provides a mixed model therapeutic apheresis service including mobile service and fixed-site therapeutic apheresis and an apheresis collection of hematopoietic stem cell (HPC-A) service. Therapeutic apheresis modalities offered by SANBS include plasmapheresis, red cell exchange, leukocyte and platelet reduction. In addition, collection of plasma, thrombocytes, mononuclear cells including CD34+ cells (HPCs) and granulocytes by apheresis for plasma and cellular therapies, and customised apheresis products for research purposes is offered. An operational database for the period 2013 to 2020 was reviewed to characterise the SANBS's mixed therapeutic apheresis service and HPC-A service from 2013 to 2020 in terms of patient numbers, patient demographics, patient procedures, therapeutic apheresis indication or diagnosis, therapeutic apheresis modality, hospital service type, and the American Society for Apheresis (ASFA) category of diagnosis. METHODS: A retrospective review of therapeutic apheresis patients referred to SANBS characterising patient numbers, patient demographics, patient procedures, therapeutic apheresis indication or diagnosis, therapeutic apheresis modality (Linz, 2017), hospital service type, and the ASFA category of diagnosis (Padmanabhan et al., 2019) for the period 01 January 2013 to 31 December 2020 was completed. Data is obtained from a SANBS operational routinely utilised to record patient procedure data. Patient procedure data is manually recorded by apheresis nurses and indexed on to the operational database, with both processes audited. The review period is a convenience sample. Storage of the database and access of the operational database is in compliance with the Protection of Personal Information Act (Government Gazette, 2013). Therapeutic apheresis modalities analysed include Plasmapheresis, Red Cell Exchange, Leukopheresis, Thrombocytapheresis, Lymphocyte collection, Granulocyte collection, Haematopoietic stem cell collection by apheresis and customised apheresis products for research purposes. Customised apheresis products for research purposes is excluded from this review. Descriptive statistics is used. RESULTS: For the review period, 2,485 unique patients with 120 unique indications as recorded by referring clinicians received 13,518 procedures involving 7 therapeutic apheresis modalities at 78 hospitals (21 public sector and 57 private sector) and at 3 SANBS blood donor centres in 7 provinces of South Africa. The age range of patients serviced is 4 months to 90 years (median = 39.5 years) (figure 1), 91% by procedure count was for patients 21 years of age or older, 62% were female, with 10,783 (79.6%) procedures performed in public sector hospitals. In all patients, the most common indications was plasmapheresis for thrombotic thromobocytopaenic purpura (52.5% of cumulative procedures), HPC-A for multiple myeloma (7.86%) and Antibody-mediated kidney transplant rejection (4.90%). Plasmapheresis was the most common therapeutic apheresis modality used (82.5% of cumulative procedures) followed by HPC-A (13.7%) and leukoreduction (3.39%). A range of indications for plasmapheresis (n = 65) and HPC-A (n = 41) were observed. Red cell exchange procedures was performed for patients with severe malaria and sickle cell disease indications. For leukoreduction indications, all patients were adults managed in public sector facilities and all were symptomatic. The most common indications were Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia, Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia and Multiple Myeloma. A pooled, total white cell count average of 457 x 109/L (range 141-689 x 109/L) prior to first procedure. Despite complex challenges for a national mixed model service, successful patient outcomes in emergent indications such as TTP (Louw et al., 2018; Swart et al., 2019) and engraftment post HPC-A in HSCT in multiple centres (Glatt, personal communication) are reported. CONCLUSION: The review confirms that apheresis medicine is increasingly used in South Africa in patients in both public and private sector, with the most common modalities being plasmapheresis, HPC-A and leukoreduction. Patients with HIV-associated TTP is the most commonly referred patient in both paediatric and adult patients and this is anticipated to continue. A growing HSCT transplant network capacity in South Africa is augmented through the mixed model mobile and fixed-site therapeutic apheresis services, including a mobile HPC-A service. The increasing number of HPC-A is a trend towards increasing numbers of patients support to HSCT for both adults and paediatric patients in private and public sector hospitals.
36219461		Influenza Vaccination Receipt in Pediatric Patients With Cancer or Sickle Cell Disease.BACKGROUND: Influenza causes greater morbidity in children with cancer or sickle cell disease (SCD). Literature on influenza vaccination receipt for these populations is limited in low-vaccination states. Outpatient interventions improve vaccine receipt but isolated inpatient interventions remain unstudied. PROCEDURE: We reviewed influenza vaccine receipt of children with cancer or SCD treated at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta during three influenza seasons. We implemented a clinical decision support intervention during an influenza season and compared influenza vaccine receipt preintervention and postintervention among admitted children. RESULTS: The oncology cohort (N=1548, 60% to 62%) and the SCD cohort (N=2549, 61% to 65%) had similar-to-higher vaccination receipt to the United States (58% to 64%, P =0.01 to 0.79) and Georgia (51% to 56%, P <0.01). The intervention did not significantly improve vaccination receipt for admitted children with cancer (40% vs. 56%, P =0.05 to 0.88) or SCD (44% vs. 56%, P =0.01). Regression modeling also found no significant increase in vaccine receipt (hematologic malignancy: 0.8 [0.73 to 0.98], solid tumor: 0.9 [0.80 to 1.90], central nervous system tumor: 0.9 [0.71 to 1.14], SCD: 0.9 [0.85 to 0.99]). CONCLUSIONS: Children with cancer and SCD have similar-to-greater influenza vaccination receipt compared with Georgia and the United States. An inpatient intervention did not significantly improve influenza vaccine receipt in these patient cohorts. Future studies are needed to identify alternative approaches to improving vaccine receipt in these cohorts.
34268729		Biomarkers of clinical severity in treated and untreated sickle cell disease: a comparison by genotypes of a single center cohort and African Americans in the NHANES study.Haemolysis and vaso-occlusion underlie multi-organ system complications in sickle cell disease (SCD). We assessed real-world biomarkers in University of Illinois adult SCD patients, categorised as severe (HbSS/Sbeta0 -thalassaemia; n = 342) or mild (HbSC/Sbeta+ -thalassaemia; n = 100) genotypes and stratified according to treatment. African-American controls from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were matched with each genotype category. Most measures of haemolysis, anaemia, inflammation and function of kidneys, liver and lungs differed markedly in untreated severe genotype patients compared to NHANES controls. These same biomarkers were significantly closer to the NHANES control range in untreated mild versus severe genotype patients, but they were not improved in severe genotype patients receiving treatment with hydroxycarbamide or blood transfusions, except that haemoglobin and HbF were higher with hydroxycarbamide. Systolic blood pressures did not differ among the SCD and NHANES groups, but diastolic pressures were higher in mild genotype patients. Ferritin in severe genotype patients on chronic transfusions was 50-fold higher than NHANES controls. The cross-sectional real-world biomarkers of patients on hydroxycarbamide or transfusions were not markedly improved compared to untreated patients. This may be due partly to poor compliance or more severe disease. Our findings highlight the need for more effective treatments.
35180760		Peripheral Blood Smear Detection of Asymptomatic Central Line Infection in a Patient With Sickle Cell Disease.Sickle cell disease is a lifelong disorder which may be managed by chronic red cell transfusion including exchange transfusion. Chronic indwelling vascular catheters including ports offer convenient and reliable access for red cell exchange but confer risk of complications including infection and thrombosis. Detection of these complications is essential for preserving vascular access and relies on both clinical and laboratory observation. Here we describe a case of asymptomatic port infection detected by manual screening of a peripheral blood smear.
36708005	treat|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell	Childhood cancer and hematological disorders negatively affect spermatogonial quantity at diagnosis: a retrospective study of a male fertility preservation cohort.STUDY QUESTION: What is the impact of cancer or hematological disorders on germ cells in pediatric male patients? SUMMARY ANSWER: Spermatogonial quantity is reduced in testes of prepubertal boys diagnosed with cancer or severe hematological disorder compared to healthy controls and this reduction is disease and age dependent: patients with central nervous system cancer (CNS tumors) and hematological disorders, as well as boys <7 years are the most affected. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Fertility preservation in pediatric male patients is considered based on the gonadotoxicity of selected treatments. Although treatment effects on germ cells have been extensively investigated, limited data are available on the effect of the disease on the prepubertal male gonad. Of the few studies investigating the effects of cancer or hematologic disorders on testicular function and germ cell quantity in prepuberty, the results are inconsistent. However, recent studies suggested impairments before the initiation of known gonadotoxic therapy. Understanding which diseases and at what age affect the germ cell pool in pediatric patients before treatment is critical to optimize strategies and counseling for fertility preservation. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This multicenter retrospective cohort study included 101 boys aged <14 years with extra-cerebral cancer (solid tumors), CNS tumors, leukemia/lymphoma (blood cancer), or non-malignant hematological disorders, who were admitted for a fertility preservation programme between 2002 and 2018. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: In addition to clinical data, we analyzed measurements of testicular volume and performed histological staining on testicular biopsies obtained before treatment, at cryopreservation, to evaluate number of spermatogonia per tubular cross-section, tubular fertility index, and the most advanced germ cell type prior to chemo-/radiotherapy. The controls were data simulations with summary statistics from original studies reporting healthy prepubertal boys' testes characteristics. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Prepubertal patients with childhood cancer or hematological disorders were more likely to have significantly reduced spermatogonial quantity compared to healthy controls (48.5% versus 31.0% prevalence, respectively). The prevalence of patients with reduced spermatogonial quantity was highest in the CNS tumor (56.7%) and the hematological disorder (55.6%) groups, including patients with hydroxyurea pre-treated sickle cell disease (58.3%) and patients not exposed to hydroxyurea (50%). Disease also adversely impacted spermatogonial distribution and differentiation. Irrespective of disease, we observed the highest spermatogonial quantity reduction in patients <7 years of age. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: For ethical reasons, we could not collect spermatogonial quantity data in healthy prepubertal boys as controls and thus deployed statistical simulation on data from literature. Also, our results should be interpreted considering low patient numbers per (sub)group. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Cancers, especially CNS tumors, and severe hematological disorders can affect spermatogonial quantity in prepubertal boys before treatment. Consequently, these patients may have a higher risk of depleted spermatogonia following therapies, resulting in persistent infertility. Therefore, patient counseling prior to disease treatment and timing of fertility preservation should not only be based on treatment regimes, but also on diagnoses and age.

33796176		[Epidemiological and clinical profile of children with Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) at the Center for the Treatment of Epidemics and Infection Prevention (CTEIP) of the University Hospital of Donka in Conakry].COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is genetically similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus. In pediatrics, it has a benign clinical course. Since the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic in Guinea, whose epicenter was Conakry, pediatric cases have been reported at the CTEIP in Donka. The purpose of this study was to determine their epidemiological profile. We conducted a descriptive cross-sectional study of children aged 0-16 years admitted to the CTEIP, Donka, over a period of four months. Out of 7308 patients, coming predominantly from 5 communes of Conakry and hospitalized in the CTEPI, 189 were aged between 0 and 16 years (2 .59%). The majority of patients were within the age-group 0-4-years (38.62%) with a sex-ratio (F/M) of 1.52; 62.96% were students, 70% of children lived in Conakry, 28.57% of mothers were traders and contact persons (39.68%); 37.57% of fathers were civil servants, 2.65% of children had a history of sickle cell disease and 1.59% had allergic rhinitis. Asymptomatic patients accounted for 52.38% of cases and diagnosed patients were 74.6%. Symptoms included fever, rhinorrhea, headache, cough, abdominal pain, sneezing, diarrhea, physical asthenia. The incidence of COVID-19 among children hospitalized in the CTEIP of Donka is low. Children aged 5 years and older are more affected and nearly 50% are asymptomatic. Common symptoms are fever, headache, rhinorrhea, cough, abdominal pain, sneezing, diarrhea, physical asthenia.

STUDY DESIGN: We analyzed the relationship between presence of comorbidities and need for hospitalization within 28 days of COVID-19 diagnosis for adolescents aged 12-17 years listed in the Pediatric COVID-19 US registry, a multicenter retrospective cohort of US pediatric patients with COVID-19. Comorbidities assessed included obesity, chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes, immunosuppressive disease or treatment, sickle cell disease (SCD), heart disease, neurologic disease/neurodevelopmental disorders, and pulmonary disease (excluding patients with mild asthma). We used multivariable logistic regression to determine race/ethnicity-adjusted associations between comorbidities and hospitalization. RESULTS: A total of 1877 patients met our inclusion criteria, of whom 284 (15%) were hospitalized within 28 days of their COVID-19 diagnosis. In a race/ethnicity-adjusted model, the following comorbidities were independently associated with increased odds of hospitalization: SCD (aOR, 6.9; 95% CI, 3.0-15.9), immunocompromising condition (aOR, 6.4; 95% CI, 3.8-10.8), obesity (aOR, 3.2; 95% CI, 2.1-4.9), diabetes (aOR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.4-6.2), neurologic disease (aOR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.8-4.3), and pulmonary disease (excluding mild asthma) (aOR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.2-3.1). Heart disease and CKD were not independently associated with hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: SCD, immunocompromising conditions, obesity, diabetes, neurologic disease, and pulmonary disease (excluding mild asthma) were associated with hospitalization for symptomatic COVID-19. Adolescents with acute COVID-19 and these comorbidities should be prioritized for consideration of therapy to avert hospitalization.
35522596		Haemoglobin S testing using HEA BeadChip  technology: Lifeblood comparison with clinical diagnosis.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Red cell antigen genotyping is commonly performed on patients requiring chronic transfusion support, such as sickle cell disease and thalassaemia. The Immucor HEA BeadChip  test, in addition to assessing red cell antigen expression, can also detect the haemoglobin S (HbS) mutation. Our aim was to compare HbS results using HEA BeadChip  performed at the Australian Red Cross Lifeblood with conventional haemoglobin studies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with thalassaemia and sickle cell trait (SCT) or disease (SCD) referred for red cell genotyping between 2017 and 2019 were assessed. The HbS result obtained from HEA BeadChip  was compared with that obtained from high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) performed by the referring pathology provider. RESULTS: One-hundred and nineteen cases had comparable HPLC and HEA BeadChip  results. On HEA BeadChip  testing, 40 cases showed a negative HbS result, 31 cases showed HbS+ and 47 cases showed HbS++. There was one case with 'low signal' result. Of the negative HbS cases, there was none with SCT. The HbS+ group comprised a mixture of SCT and SCD due to compound heterozygosity for HbS and beta-thalassaemia mutations. The HbS++ group comprised predominantly SCD due to homozygosity for HbS. CONCLUSION: HEA BeadChip  is an accurate screening test for the detection of HbS. There were no false positives or false negatives. The identification of donors with the HbS mutation through the targeted genotyping programme would enable early intervention, improved donor management and reduced wastage.
38302121		Disease-Modifying Therapies for Sickle Cell Disease-An Overview.Sickle cell disease refers to a group of inherited blood disorders in which hemoglobin polymerization leads to hemolysis and vaso-occlusion. This causes a myriad of complications during a patient's life span, ranging from anemia, infections, and acute and chronic pain to stroke and multiorgan dysfunction. Although there have been dramatic improvements in childhood survival thanks to improved supportive care with penicillin prophylaxis, immunizations, and improved transfusion practices, there was a dearth of disease-modifying therapies, with hydroxyurea being the only medication for >20 years. Here, we discuss the newer therapies for sickle cell disease that have emerged in recent years. [Pediatr Ann. 2024;53(2):e52-e55.].
35916466	associate|@DISEASE_Cystic_Fibrosis|@GENE_CFTR ;associate|@DISEASE_Muscular_Atrophy_Spinal|@GENE_CFTR	Genetic counseling and carrier screening in candidates for gamete donation at a Portuguese center.OBJECTIVE: Genetic counseling and carrier screening are part of the gamete donation process by healthy individuals. We aim to review the findings of genetic counseling and carrier screening of a cohort of candidates at our public gametes bank. METHODS: Thirty-four male and 64 female candidates had genetic counseling with a medical geneticist before donation. Of these, one female candidate voluntarily dropped-out. Thirty-four males and 63 females performed karyotype and screening for the more common pathogenic variants for CFTR-related cystic fibrosis and spinal muscular atrophy (SMN1) in the Portuguese population. In addition, all females also performed Fragile X expansion screening (FMR1). Thirty candidates with known or assumed African ancestry performed hemoglobinopathies screening. RESULTS: Six candidates were definitely or temporarily withheld from the donation process given their family or personal history that required further investigation. Of 97 candidates tested, 16.5% presented anomalous laboratory results (16/97): ten candidates were carriers for an autosomal recessive disorder - cystic fibrosis (5/97), sickle cell anemia (3/30), and spinal muscular atrophy (2/97). One female was an FMR1 pre-mutation carrier (1/63). One female candidate presented with triple X mosaicism: 47,XXX[2]/46,XX[50]. Two candidates presented with chromosomal instability of unknown origin. In one candidate, a mosaic for the Philadelphia chromosome was detected, revealing the diagnosis of chronic myeloid leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: From a cohort of 97 candidates, 21.7% had a family/personal history or an anomalous laboratory result that required additional genetic counseling, stressing the importance of performing pre-donation genetic counseling in this population.
34418575		Alteration of grey matter volume is associated with pain and quality of life in children with sickle cell disease.Pain is the most common symptom experienced by patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and is associated with poor quality of life. We investigated the association between grey matter volume (GMV) and the frequency of pain crises in the preceding 12 months and SCD-specific quality of life (QOL) assessed by the PedsQLTM SCD module in 38 pediatric patients with SCD. Using voxel-based morphometry methodology, high-resolution T1 structural scans were preprocessed using SPM and further analyzed in SPSS. The whole brain multiple regression analysis identified that perigenual anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) GMV was negatively associated with the frequency of pain crises (r = -0.656, P = 0.003). A two-group t-test analysis showed that the subgroup having pain crisis/crises in the past year also showed significantly lower GMV at left supratemporal gyrus than the group without any pain crisis (p=0.024). The further 21 pain-related regions of interest (ROI) analyses identified a negative correlation between pregenual ACC (r = -0.551, P = 0.001), subgenual ACC (r = -0.540, P = 0.001) and the frequency of pain crises. Additionally, the subgroup with poorer QOL displayed significantly reduced GMV in the parahippocampus (left: P = 0.047; right: P = 0.024). The correlations between the cerebral structural alterations and the accentuated pain experience and QOL suggests a possible role of central mechanisms in SCD pain.
33650125		Long-term tolerability of phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors in pulmonary hypertension of sickle cell disease.OBJECTIVES: Sickle cell disease-related pulmonary hypertension (SCD-PH) is a complex disorder with multifactorial contributory mechanisms. Previous trials have evaluated the efficacy of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) therapies in SCD-PH with mixed results. We hypothesized that a subset of patients with right heart catheterization (RHC) confirmed disease may benefit from PAH therapy. METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of patients with SCD-PH diagnosed by RHC who were treated with phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor (PDE5-I) therapy for >=4 months between 2008 and 2019 at two institutions. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients were included in the analysis. The median age (IQR) upon PDE5-I initiation was 47.5 years (35-51.5 years); 58% were female and twenty-nine (81%) had HbSS disease. Of these, 53% of patients had a history of acute chest syndrome, 42% had a history of venous thromboembolism, and 38% had imaging consistent with chronic thromboembolic PH. Patients were treated for a median duration of 25 months (IQR 13-60 months). Use of PDE5-I was associated with a significant improvement in symptoms as assessed by NYHA Class (P = .002). CONCLUSIONS: In SCD patients with PH defined by RHC, PDE5-I therapy was tolerated long-term and may improve physical activity.

36509124		Diagnostic Test Accuracy of Lung Ultrasound for Acute Chest Syndrome in Sickle Cell Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.BACKGROUND: Acute chest syndrome (ACS) is a leading cause of death in patients with sickle cell disease. Lung ultrasound (LUS) is emerging as a point-of-care method to diagnose ACS, allowing for more rapid diagnosis in the ED setting and sparing patients from ionizing radiation exposure. RESEARCH QUESTION: What is the diagnostic accuracy of LUS for ACS diagnosis, using the current reference standard of chest radiography? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed for this systematic review and meta-analysis. Embase, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were used to compile all relevant studies. Two reviewers screened the studies for inclusion in this review. Cases of discrepancy were resolved by a third reviewer. Meta-analyses were conducted using both metadta and midas STATA software packages to retrieve summary receiver operating characteristic curves, sensitivities, and specificities. Three reviewers scored the studies with QUADAS-2 for risk of bias assessment. RESULTS: From a total of 713 unique studies retrieved, six studies were included in the final quantitative synthesis. Of these, five studies were in pediatric EDs. Two studies were conference abstracts and not published manuscripts. Data were available for 625 possible ACS cases (97% of cases in patients aged <= 21 years) and 95 confirmed ACS diagnoses (pretest probability of 15.2%). The summary sensitivity was 0.92 (95% CI, 0.68-0.98) and the summary specificity was 0.89 (95% CI, 0.69-0.97) with an area under the curve of the summary receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.96 (95% CI, 0.94-0.97). INTERPRETATION: LUS has excellent sensitivity and very good specificity for ACS diagnosis and may serve as an initial point-of-care test to facilitate rapid treatment of ACS and spare pediatric patients from ionizing radiation; however, further research is warranted to improve the generalizability to the adult sickle cell disease population.
35485039		[Self-management of pain crisis in patients with sickle cell disease].Introduction : Sickle cell disease, while it is the most common genetic disease in France, is little known to caregivers and the general public.Context : Only a few studies have examined the daily lives of people suffering from this disease.Objectives : The purpose of this project was to describe the specific strategies helping adult patients to manage the symptoms of their disease.Method : To reach this objective, a qualitative study was conducted among eight homozygous (SS) people over 30 years old living in the Ile-de-France region of France. The semi-structured interviews took place at the patients' homes, selected from several regional competence centers and on social media. An inductive methodology and a thematic analysis were used to draw the conclusions of this research.Results : They show that pain and suffering are patients' main complaints. Patients suffering from sickle cell disease seek numerous effective self-care strategies to manage their long-term pain : preventive measures and drugs, as well as complementary and alternative medicine.Discussion : A sociological approach shows us the considerable work that patients undertake to manage symptoms daily.Conclusion : The findings support interventions that would increase the feeling of control over the disease through better self-awareness and appropriate physical activity.

Given its high prevalence globally, whether sickle cell trait (SCT) is a risk factor for neurological injury has been of interest; however, data have been limited. We hypothesized that young, healthy adults with SCT would show normal cerebrovascular structure and hemodynamic function. METHODS: As a case-control study, young adults with (N=25, cases) and without SCT (N=24, controls) underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging to quantify brain volume, microstructural integrity (fractional anisotropy), silent cerebral infarcts (SCI), intracranial stenosis, and aneurysms. Pseudocontinuous arterial spin labeling and asymmetric spin echo sequences measured cerebral blood flow and oxygen extraction fraction, respectively, from which cerebral metabolic oxygen demand was calculated. Imaging metrics were compared between SCT cases and controls. SCI volume was correlated with baseline characteristics. RESULTS: Compared with controls, adults with SCT demonstrated similar normalized brain volumes (SCT 0.80 versus control 0.81, P=0.41), white matter fractional anisotropy (SCT 0.41 versus control 0.43, P=0.37), cerebral blood flow (SCT 62.04 versus control, 61.16 mL/min/100 g, P=0.67), oxygen extraction fraction (SCT 0.27 versus control 0.27, P=0.31), and cerebral metabolic oxygen demand (SCT 2.71 versus control 2.70 mL/min/100 g, P=0.96). One per cohort had an intracranial aneurysm. None had intracranial stenosis. The SCT cases and controls showed similar prevalence and volume of SCIs; however, in the subset of participants with SCIs, the SCT cases had greater SCI volume versus controls (0.29 versus 0.07 mL, P=0.008). Of baseline characteristics, creatinine was mildly elevated in the SCT cohort (0.9 versus 0.8 mg/dL, P=0.053) and correlated with SCI volume (rho=0.49, P=0.032). In the SCT cohort, SCI distribution was similar to that of young adults with sickle cell anemia. CONCLUSIONS: Adults with SCT showed normal cerebrovascular structure and hemodynamic function. These findings suggest that healthy individuals with SCT are unlikely to be at increased risk for early or accelerated ischemic brain injury.
34417053		Influenza immunization coverage of children with sickle cell disease.OBJECTIVES: To assess receipt of annual flu immunization among children living with sickle cell disease (SCD). METHODS: Receipt of flu immunization (2014-2019) by SCD status was assessed among all Michigan children <18 years of age using the statewide immunization registry. Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds of annual flu immunization by SCD status and age. RESULTS: Annual flu immunization coverage was higher among children with SCD (46.9%; n = 751) than without (23.2%; n = 2,012,846). The annual adjusted odds of flu immunization for those with SCD were 2.8 (95% CI: 2.5-3.1) times higher than for those without SCD; there were no significant differences by age among children with SCD. Among those without SCD, adolescents aged 13-17 were 2.2 (95% CI: 2.2-2.2) times less likely to receive annual flu immunization than children 6-35 months. CONCLUSIONS: Children with SCD had higher annual flu immunization rates than those without SCD, but >50% remain unimmunized.

34628962		Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant for Sickle Cell Disease: PATIENT SELEction and Timing Based on Sickle Cell-Related Multiple Chronic Conditions.Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is the only cure for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Although most SCD patients experience progressive end-organ damage and shortened lifespans, not all patients follow the same disease course, tempo, or outcome. Therefore, the dilemma facing physicians is weighing the selection of patients and timing for the procedure against donor type and transplant-related mortality and morbidity that go up with increasing age. On the other hand, the dilemma facing the patients and families is how acceptable HSCT that carries some mortality risks to them. We have analyzed the chronic conditions due to SCD in 449 patients to determine whether SCD-related multiple chronic conditions (MCC) can be risk-stratified to identify the group of patients predicted to not only have shortened lifespans but also functional limitation and poor quality of life so that these at-risk patients can be offered HSCT early and before MCC develops. We identified that the age of onset of the first SCD-related chronic conditions strongly predicted for the risks for disease-related MCC. SCD patients who suffered their first disease-related chronic condition before age 30 years developed MCC at a rate of 19.1 times faster than those at a later age. These patients are therefore high-risk patients and should be offered HSCT early in the course of their disease before multiple organ damage intervenes, even if matched-related donors are not available. This patient selection and timing approach provides a forum for an easy-to-understand and real-time discussion, including the choice of donor type, with SCD patients and families when considering HSCT.
36866433	treat|@CHEMICAL_eculizumab|@DISEASE_Syndrome ;treat|@CHEMICAL_Rituximab|@DISEASE_Syndrome	Case report: Successful treatment with plasma exchange in life-threatening hyperhemolytic syndrome unrelated to sickle cell disease.INTRODUCTION: Hyperhemolytic syndrome (HHS) is a severe form of delayed transfusion reaction primarily described in sickle cell anemia patients which is characterized by a hemoglobin decrease to pre-transfusion levels or lower, often with reticulocytopenia and no evidence of auto- or allo-antibodies. CASE PRESENTATION: We present two cases of severe HHS in patients without sickle cell anemia refractory to treatment with steroids, immunoglobulins, and rituximab. In one case, temporary relief was achieved with eculizumab. In both cases, plasma exchange resulted in a profound and immediate response allowing for splenectomy and resolution of hemolysis. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: We discuss the pathophysiology of HHS, its presentation and treatment and expand on the possible role of plasma exchange in this setting.
35013786		Current applications for measuring pediatric intima-media thickness.Intima-media thickness is a known subclinical radiologic marker of the early manifestations of atherosclerotic disease. It is the thickness of the vessel wall, most often the carotid artery. Intima-media thickness is measured on conventional US manually or automatically. Other measurement techniques include radiofrequency US. Because there is variation in its measurement, especially in children, several recommendations have been set to increase the measurement's validity and comparability among studies. Despite these recommendations, several pitfalls should be avoided, and quality control should be performed to avoid erroneous interpretation. This article summarizes current literature in relation to the clinical applications for intima-media thickness measurement in children with known risk factors such as obesity, liver steatosis, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, hypertension, systemic inflammatory diseases, cancer survival, kidney and liver transplant, and sickle cell disease or beta thalassemia major. Most potential indications for intima-media thickness measurement remain in the research domain and should be interpreted combined with other markers. The objective of diagnosing an increased intima-media thickness is to start a multidisciplinary treatment approach to prevent disease progression and its sequelae in adulthood.
34550643	treat|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell	How I approach disease-modifying therapy in children with sickle cell disease in an era of novel therapies.Finally,after decades of stagnation, the therapeutic landscape for sickle cell disease (SCD) is changing with an increasing number of novel therapeutics. Hydroxyurea remains the primary disease-modifying therapy and, when started early in life with maintenance of an optimal dose, can reduce many SCD-related complications. To complement hydroxyurea, there are a growing number of pharmacologic options with additional efforts focused on the development and optimization of curative therapies. Here, we review current treatment options and provide recommendations as to how to approach the treatment of children and adolescents within this evolving therapeutic landscape to allow for full and healthy lives.
33974583		Maintenance of a High Influenza Vaccination Rate and Improvement in Health Outcomes in a Pediatric Sickle Cell Disease Clinic.BACKGROUND: Children with sickle cell disease (SCD) are at high-risk of complications from influenza and should receive an influenza vaccination seasonally. Despite this recommendation, vaccination rates remain suboptimal. Boston Medical Center (BMC) previously achieved high influenza vaccination rates among its pediatric patients with SCD. The purpose of this study was to determine whether this high vaccination rate has been maintained and whether it has influenced outcome measures. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted in the hematology clinic at an urban, academic medical center. Fisher's exact test and the independent samples t test were used to determine if there were any significant differences in characteristics between patients with influenza and patients without influenza, as well as between vaccinated and unvaccinated patients. Influenza vaccination rate, influenza-related hospitalization rate, and influenza-positive rate were collected and compared with reported rates. RESULTS: Data from 124 pediatric patients with SCD were examined. The influenza vaccination rate for pediatric patients with SCD at BMC (90.32%) was higher than previous studies that were not conducted at BMC, while BMC's influenza-related hospitalization rate (0) and influenza-positive rate (4.84%) were lower than other studies. Subjects who contracted influenza were younger than those who did not (4.67 vs. 10.03 y, P=0.005). CONCLUSIONS: BMC has maintained a high influenza vaccination rate among pediatric patients with SCD. BMC's vaccination strategy has been successful at improving outcome measures including rates of influenza and influenza hospitalizations without requiring additional staff. Such efforts should be replicated at other centers.

35723675		Effects of pregnancy on cardiac structure and function in women with sickle cell anemia: a longitudinal comparative study.BACKGROUND: Sickle cell anemia is the commonest hemoglobinopathy in pregnant Nigerian women, and cardiac manifestations are a significant feature of the disease especially in pregnancy. Pregnant women with sickle cell anemia are at high risk of morbidity and mortality and cardiac dysfunction in them increases this risk and may compromise their post-partum health. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cardiac size and function in women with sickle cell anemia (HbSS) during late pregnancy and postpartum. METHODOLOGY: This was a longitudinal comparative study in which 40 women, consisting of 20 pregnant HBSS and 20 pregnant HBAA women controls, were recruited. Echocardiography was performed in the third trimester of pregnancy and 6 weeks postpartum. RESULTS: There was a decrease in the mean left atrial diameter (p < .001), left ventricular diameter in diastole (p = .041), and left ventricular mass (p = .004) of HBSS women in the postpartum period compared to their antepartum state. In contrast, there was no significant difference in most cardiac dimensions of pregnant vs postpartum HBAA women. There was no significant change in cardiac function in the pregnant vs postpartum states in both study groups. There were significant differences in cardiac size but not function when comparing HBSS and HBAA women in pregnancy and postpartum. CONCLUSION: Changes in cardiac size of sickle cell women in pregnancy does not appear to affect cardiac function during pregnancy and in the puerperium, suggesting that the increased size may purely be a response to their chronic anemic state. Studies following women up for longer periods including those with co-morbidities are recommended.

35405207	cause|@CHEMICAL_Creatinine|@DISEASE_Acute_Kidney_Injury ;associate|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell|@GENE_APOL1	Black and White Adults With CKD Hospitalized With Acute Kidney Injury: Findings From the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study.RATIONALE & OBJECTIVE: Few studies have investigated racial disparities in acute kidney injury (AKI), in contrast to the extensive literature on racial differences in the risk of kidney failure. We sought to study potential differences in risk in the setting of chronic kidney disease (CKD). STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: We studied 2,720 self-identified Black or White participants with CKD enrolled in the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study from July 1, 2013, to December 31, 2017. EXPOSURE: Self-reported race (Black vs White). OUTCOME: Hospitalized AKI (>=50% increase from nadir to peak serum creatinine). ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Cox regression models adjusting for demographics (age and sex), prehospitalization clinical risk factors (diabetes, blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, estimated glomerular filtration rate, proteinuria, receipt of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers), and socioeconomic status (insurance status and education level). In a subset of participants with genotype data, we adjusted for apolipoprotein L1 gene (APOL1) high-risk status and sickle cell trait. RESULTS: Black participants (n = 1,266) were younger but had a higher burden of prehospitalization clinical risk factors. The incidence rate of first AKI hospitalization among Black participants was 6.3 (95% CI, 5.5-7.2) per 100 person-years versus 5.3 (95% CI, 4.6-6.1) per 100 person-years among White participants. In an unadjusted Cox regression model, Black participants were at a modestly increased risk of incident AKI (HR, 1.22 [95% CI, 1.01-1.48]) compared with White participants. However, this risk was attenuated and no longer significant after adjusting for prehospitalization clinical risk factors (adjusted HR, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.83-1.25]). There were only 11 AKI hospitalizations among individuals with high-risk APOL1 risk status and 14 AKI hospitalizations among individuals with sickle cell trait. LIMITATIONS: Participants were limited to research volunteers and potentially not fully representative of all CKD patients. CONCLUSIONS: In this multicenter prospective cohort of CKD patients, racial disparities in AKI incidence were modest and were explained by differences in prehospitalization clinical risk factors.

35222587		Prevalence of sickle cell trait and its association to renal dysfunction among blood donors at University of Medical Sciences Teaching Hospital, Ondo, Nigeria.INTRODUCTION: Prospective blood donors are routinely screened for blood borne infections but medical illnesses and haemoglobin genotype are overlooked despite a high prevalence of haemoglobin AS among Nigerian donors. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of haemoglobin AS and its association to renal function, if any. METHOD: Apparently healthy donors were studied between February and December 2018. Their haemoglobin genotype and, estimated glomerular filtration rates were determined. RESULTS: There were 96 males (94.1%) and 6 (5.9%) females with mean age of 26.7+-4.5 years (range 19-44 years) and mean eGFR of 103.97+-19.00ml/min/1.73m2. Eighty one (79.4%) and 21 (20.6%) subjects had haemoglobin AA and AS genotypes respectively. The mean eGFR for subjects with haemoglobin AA and AS were 105.2+-18.6ml/min/1.73m2 and 99.9 +- 21.2ml/min/1.73m2 respectively (p value = 0.270). Eighty one (79.4%), 20 (19.6%) and 1 (1.0%) subjects had renal function at >90ml/min/1.73m2, 60-89ml/min/1.73m2 and 30-59ml/min/m2 respectively. There was no significant difference in the mean eGFR between subjects with haemoglobin AA and AS (mean difference 5.3, p = 0.265, 95%CI = -4.07 to 14.60). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of sickle cell trait among Nigerian blood donors is high. There is no significant difference in the renal function status of blood donors with SCT and normal haemoglobin genotype.
37051746		Parental perspective on the risk of infertility and fertility preservation options for children and adolescents with sickle cell disease considering hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.BACKGROUND: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) performed in children from human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical related donors is associated with very high survival rates and disease-free survival. Patients are exposed to gonadotoxic alkylating agents or irradiation in the HCT conditioning regimen. Consequently, infertility is a major long-term complication of HCT for sickle cell disease (SCD). We sought to understand how caregivers perceive the risk of infertility from HCT, how they perceive the options for fertility preservation, and how this risk perception impacted their decision-making to pursue HCT. PROCEDURES: We conducted qualitative interviews with primary caregivers after a consultation for HCT for SCD. Data were analyzed using descriptive qualitative analysis. RESULTS: We interviewed 19 primary caregivers who had attended a consultation with an HCT physician (female, age 25-59 [median 39] years). Eleven participants reported that their child had an available HLA-matched donor. Analysis revealed that (i) mothers were worried about death and graft-versus-host disease from HCT, more than about the risk of infertility; (ii) parents have a realistic understanding of the risk of infertility after HCT and take it into consideration in decision-making; (iii) parents report multiple barriers to fertility preservation. CONCLUSION: For parents actively considering HCT for their child with SCD, the risk of infertility while important was not a barrier to pursuing HCT. Inconvenience and invasiveness of fertility preservation procedures are some of the barriers to pursuing fertility preservation for their child. Future research must aim at addressing these barriers to fertility preservation.
34079130	associate|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell|@GENE_HBB	Base editing of haematopoietic stem cells rescues sickle cell disease in mice.Sickle cell disease (SCD) is caused by a mutation in the beta-globin gene HBB1. We used a custom adenine base editor (ABE8e-NRCH)2,3 to convert the SCD allele (HBBS) into Makassar beta-globin (HBBG), a non-pathogenic variant4,5. Ex vivo delivery of mRNA encoding the base editor with a targeting guide RNA into haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) from patients with SCD resulted in 80% conversion of HBBS to HBBG. Sixteen weeks after transplantation of edited human HSPCs into immunodeficient mice, the frequency of HBBG was 68% and hypoxia-induced sickling of bone marrow reticulocytes had decreased fivefold, indicating durable gene editing. To assess the physiological effects of HBBS base editing, we delivered ABE8e-NRCH and guide RNA into HSPCs from a humanized SCD mouse6 and then transplanted these cells into irradiated mice. After sixteen weeks, Makassar beta-globin represented 79% of beta-globin protein in blood, and hypoxia-induced sickling was reduced threefold. Mice that received base-edited HSPCs showed near-normal haematological parameters and reduced splenic pathology compared to mice that received unedited cells. Secondary transplantation of edited bone marrow confirmed that the gene editing was durable in long-term haematopoietic stem cells and showed that HBBS-to-HBBG editing of 20% or more is sufficient for phenotypic rescue. Base editing of human HSPCs avoided the p53 activation and larger deletions that have been observed following Cas9 nuclease treatment. These findings point towards a one-time autologous treatment for SCD that eliminates pathogenic HBBS, generates benign HBBG, and minimizes the undesired consequences of double-strand DNA breaks.

The patient had a history of dactylitis 3 times in his first year of life and febrile episodes twice at the consult. His 4-year-old sister was found to be human leukocyte antigen (HLA) identical. The patient was started on hydroxyurea (HU) at 2.5 years of age. His parents again sought consultation when he was 5 years old because of concerns about his medical condition. At the time, the patient had experienced 2 vaso-occlusive pain episodes (VOEs) requiring hospitalization during the previous 2 years. He had also experienced intermittent pain crises requiring rest at home for 2 to 3 days. The child has not attended school in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The family is considering HCT but is ambivalent about it because of potential toxicity. In case 2, an 8-year-old female child is 3 years out from HCT for SCD from her HLA-identical sibling. Before HCT, despite receiving HU, she had experienced >5 VOEs requiring hospitalization and 2 episodes of acute chest syndromes in the previous 3 years. She had also been missing almost 50 days of school days each year. After HCT, she is now attending school regularly and participating in all normal age-appropriate activities. The parents believe that HCT has been transformative in their child's life.
35260961		Pragmatic Clinical Trial to Improve Patient Experience Among Adults During Transitions from Hospital to Home: the PArTNER study.INTRODUCTION: Minority-serving hospitals (MSHs) need evidence-based strategies tailored to the populations they serve to improve patient-centered outcomes after hospitalization. METHODS: We conducted a pragmatic randomized clinical trial (RCT) from October 2014 to January 2017 at a MSH comparing the effectiveness of a stakeholder-supported Navigator intervention vs. Usual care on post-hospital patient experience, outcomes, and healthcare utilization. Community health workers and peer coaches delivered the intervention which included (1) in-hospital visits to assess barriers to health/healthcare and to develop a personalized Discharge Patient Education Tool (DPET); (2) a home visit to review the DPET; and (3) telephone-based peer coaching. The co-primary outcomes were between-group comparisons of 30-day changes in Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) measures of anxiety and informational support (minimum important difference is 2 to 5 units change); a p-value <0.025 was considered significant using intention-to-treat analysis. Secondary outcomes included death, ED visits, or readmissions and measures of emotional, social, and physical health at 30 and 60 days. RESULTS: We enrolled 1029 adults hospitalized with heart failure (28%), pneumonia (22%), MI (10%), COPD (11%), or sickle cell disease (29%). Over 80% were non-Hispanic Black. Overall, there were no significant between-group differences in the 30-day change in anxiety (adjusted difference: -1.6, 97.5% CI -3.3 to 0.1, p=0.03), informational support (adjusted difference: -0.01, 97.5% CI -2.0 to 1.9, p=0.99), or any secondary outcomes. Exploratory analyses suggested the Navigator intervention improved anxiety among participants with COPD, a primary care provider, a hospitalization in the past 12 months, or higher baseline anxiety; among participants without health insurance, the intervention improved informational support (all p-values <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In this pragmatic RCT at a MSH, the Navigator intervention did not improve post-hospital anxiety, informational support, or other outcomes compared to Usual care. Benefits observed in participant subgroups should be confirmed in future studies. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT02114515.
37273202		Association of Sickle Cell Disease With Racial Disparities and Severe Maternal Morbidities in Black Individuals.Importance: Little is known about the association between sickle cell disease (SCD) and severe maternal morbidity (SMM). Objective: To examine the association of SCD with racial disparities in SMM and with SMM among Black individuals. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study was a retrospective population-based investigation of individuals with and without SCD in 5 states (California [2008-2018], Michigan [2008-2020], Missouri [2008-2014], Pennsylvania [2008-2014], and South Carolina [2008-2020]) delivering a fetal death or live birth. Data were analyzed between July and December 2022. Exposure: Sickle cell disease identified during the delivery admission by using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision and Tenth Revision codes. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes were SMM including and excluding blood transfusions during the delivery hospitalization. Modified Poisson regression was used to estimate risk ratios (RRs) adjusted for birth year, state, insurance type, education, maternal age, Adequacy of Prenatal Care Utilization Index, and obstetric comorbidity index. Results: From a sample of 8 693 616 patients (mean [SD] age, 28.5 [6.1] years), 956 951 were Black individuals (11.0%), of whom 3586 (0.37%) had SCD. Black individuals with SCD vs Black individuals without SCD were more likely to have Medicaid insurance (70.2% vs 64.6%), to have a cesarean delivery (44.6% vs 34.0%), and to reside in South Carolina (25.2% vs 21.5%). Sickle cell disease accounted for 8.9% and for 14.3% of the Black-White disparity in SMM and nontransfusion SMM, respectively. Among Black individuals, SCD complicated 0.37% of the pregnancies but contributed to 4.3% of the SMM cases and to 6.9% of the nontransfusion SMM cases. Among Black individuals with SCD compared with those without, the crude RRs of SMM and nontransfusion SMM during the delivery hospitalization were 11.9 (95% CI, 11.3-12.5) and 19.8 (95% CI, 18.5-21.2), respectively, while the adjusted RRs were 3.8 (95% CI, 3.3-4.5) and 6.5 (95% CI, 5.3-8.0), respectively. The SMM indicators that incurred the highest adjusted RRs included air and thrombotic embolism (4.8; 95% CI, 2.9-7.8), puerperal cerebrovascular disorders (4.7; 95% CI, 3.0-7.4), and blood transfusion (3.7; 95% CI, 3.2-4.3). Conclusions and Relevance: In this retrospective cohort study, SCD was found to be an important contributor to racial disparities in SMM and was associated with an elevated risk of SMM among Black individuals. Efforts from the research community, policy makers, and funding agencies are needed to advance care among individuals with SCD.
34200975		Cell and Gene Therapy for Anemia: Hematopoietic Stem Cells and Gene Editing.Hereditary anemia has various manifestations, such as sickle cell disease (SCD), Fanconi anemia, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PDD), and thalassemia. The available management strategies for these disorders are still unsatisfactory and do not eliminate the main causes. As genetic aberrations are the main causes of all forms of hereditary anemia, the optimal approach involves repairing the defective gene, possibly through the transplantation of normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from a normal matching donor or through gene therapy approaches (either in vivo or ex vivo) to correct the patient's HSCs. To clearly illustrate the importance of cell and gene therapy in hereditary anemia, this paper provides a review of the genetic aberration, epidemiology, clinical features, current management, and cell and gene therapy endeavors related to SCD, thalassemia, Fanconi anemia, and G6PDD. Moreover, we expound the future research direction of HSC derivation from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), strategies to edit HSCs, gene therapy risk mitigation, and their clinical perspectives. In conclusion, gene-corrected hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has promising outcomes for SCD, Fanconi anemia, and thalassemia, and it may overcome the limitation of the source of allogenic bone marrow transplantation.
37671902		Acute chest syndrome in children with sickle cell disease: Data from a national AIEOP cohort identify priority areas of intervention in a hub-and-spoke system.Acute chest syndrome (ACS) is a frequent cause of hospitalization in sickle cell disease (SCD). Despite advances in acute care, many settings still lack knowledge about ACS best practices. After the AIEOP Guidelines were published in 2012, suggesting standardized management in Italy, a retrospective study was performed to assess the diagnostic and therapeutic pathways of ACS in children. From 2013 to 2018, 208 ACS episodes were presented by 122/583 kids in 11 centres. 73 were male, mean age 10.9 years, 85% African, 92% HbSS or Sbeta . In our hub-and-spoke system, a good adherence to Guidelines was documented, but discrepancies between reference centres and general hospitals were noted. Improvement is needed for timely transfer to reference centres, use of incentive spirometry, oxygen therapy and pain management.
36264096		The Consortium on Newborn Screening in Africa for sickle cell disease: study rationale and methodology.Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a common condition within sub-Saharan Africa and associated with high under-5 mortality (U5M). The American Society of Hematology instituted the Consortium on Newborn Screening in Africa (CONSA) for SCD, a 7-country network of sites to implement standardized newborn hemoglobinopathy screening and early intervention for children with SCD in sub-Saharan Africa. CONSA's overall hypothesis is that early infant SCD screening and entry into standardized, continuous care will reduce U5M compared with historical estimates in the region. Primary trial objectives are to determine the population-based birth incidence of SCD and effectiveness of early standardized care for preventing early mortality consortium-wide at each country's site(s). Secondary objectives are to establish universal screening and early interventions for SCD within clinical networks of CONSA partners and assess trial implementation. Outcomes will be evaluated from data collected using a shared patient registry. Standardized trial procedures will be implemented among designated birth populations in 7 African countries whose programs met eligibility criteria. Treatment protocol includes administering antibacterial and antimalarial prophylaxis and standard childhood vaccinations against infections commonly affecting children with SCD. Infants with a positive screen and confirmation of SCD within the catchment areas defined by each consortium partner will be enrolled in the clinical intervention protocol and followed regularly until age of 5 years. Effectiveness of these early interventions, along with culturally appropriate family education and counseling, will be evaluated by comparing U5M in the enrolled cohort to estimated preprogram data. Here, we describe the methodology planned for this trial.
34705847		Profile of Medicaid enrollees with sickle cell disease: A high need, high cost population.Sickle cell disease is a progressively debilitating genetic condition that affects red blood cells and can result in a variety of serious medical complications, reduced life expectancy, and diminished quality of life. Medicaid nationwide covered 66 percent of sickle cell disease hospitalizations in 2004 and 58 percent of emergency department visits for the disease between 1999 and 2007. Using Medicaid data from four states with large populations that account for more than one-third of Medicaid program enrollment, we examined the characteristics of those with sickle cell disease. We found instances of mortality rates more than nine times the age-adjusted population average (in Texas, a mortality rate for Medicaid enrollees with SCD of 1.11 percent compared to 0.12 percent overall); rates of disability-related eligibility-which is associated with long-term Medicaid enrollment-of up to 69 percent; and half or more of affected enrollees having (all-cause) hospital stays, emergency department visits, and opioid prescription fills. With gene therapies on the horizon that will spur discussions of treatment coverage, costs, and outcomes for people with sickle cell disease, it is important for relevant stakeholders to understand the affected populations.
37072548		Advances in the Diagnosis and Treatment of Pediatric Arterial Ischemic Stroke.Though rare, stroke in infants and children is an important cause of mortality and chronic morbidity in the pediatric population. Neuroimaging advances and implementation of pediatric stroke care protocols have led to the ability to rapidly diagnose stroke and in many cases determine the stroke etiology. Though data on efficacy of hyperacute therapies, such as intravenous thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy, in pediatric stroke are limited, feasibility and safety data are mounting and support careful consideration of these treatments for childhood stroke. Recent therapeutic advances allow for targeted stroke prevention efforts in high-risk conditions, such as moyamoya, sickle cell disease, cardiac disease, and genetic disorders. Despite these exciting advances, important knowledge gaps persist, including optimal dosing and type of thrombolytic agents, inclusion criteria for mechanical thrombectomy, the role of immunomodulatory therapies for focal cerebral arteriopathy, optimal long-term antithrombotic strategies, the role of patent foramen ovale closure in pediatric stroke, and optimal rehabilitation strategies after stroke of the developing brain.
36947020		TCD screening and spending among children with sickle cell anemia.OBJECTIVES: National guidelines recommend that children with sickle cell anemia receive annual transcranial Doppler (TCD) screening to assess stroke risk. Our objectives were to estimate the rate of TCD screening among privately insured children with sickle cell anemia, estimate out-of-pocket spending for TCD screening, and evaluate the association between TCD screening and enrollment in high-deductible health plans (HDHPs). STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional. METHODS: Using the 2009-2017 IBM MarketScan Commercial Database, we identified children aged 2 to 15 years who met a validated claims-based definition of sickle cell anemia. We calculated the proportion of children receiving annual TCD screening and out-of-pocket spending per TCD screen. Using logistic regression with generalized estimating equations, we modeled the receipt of annual TCD screening as a function of HDHP enrollment, controlling for demographics and year. RESULTS: The 2519 children in the analysis accounted for 7197 person-years of enrollment; 14% of person-years were from HDHP enrollees. During 2009-2017, the proportion of children receiving TCD screening ranged from 40% to 44%. Median out-of-pocket spending for TCD screening was $20 overall and $65 among HDHP enrollees. Out-of-pocket spending exceeded $100 for 27% of all screens and 42% of screens among HDHP enrollees. HDHP enrollment was not associated with TCD screening (adjusted odds ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.85-1.15). CONCLUSIONS: Among privately insured children with sickle cell anemia, fewer than half received annual TCD screening. Out-of-pocket spending exceeded $100 for 27% of TCD screens. Although HDHP enrollment was not associated with TCD screening, additional studies are needed to assess whether cost sharing might deter this screening.
35791853		Barriers and Facilitators to Chronic Red Cell Transfusion Therapy in Pediatric Sickle Cell Anemia.Background: Chronic red cell transfusion (CRCT) therapy is one of a few effective disease-modifying therapies for children with sickle cell anemia (SCA). CRCT is recommended for primary and secondary stroke prevention for at-risk children with SCA and is sometimes used for other disease-related complications. However, CRCT can be resource- and time-intensive for patients/families, providers, and organizations. This study was conducted to provide a comprehensive, multilevel examination of barriers and facilitators to transfusion therapy in children with SCA from health care provider and caregiver perspectives. Methods: A qualitative descriptive approach was used to conduct key informant interviews in a sample of 26 caregivers and 25 providers across the United States. Interviews were analyzed using directed content analysis with the Multilevel Ecological Model of Health as an initial coding framework and the constant comparison method. Results: Ten barrier themes and 10 facilitator themes emerged across all ecological levels. Themes most commonly occurred on the patient and organizational levels. Key barriers themes included Logistical Challenges, Obtaining and Maintaining Venous Access, Alloantibodies/Alloimmunization and Reactions, and Iron Overload and Adherence to Chelation Therapy. Key facilitator themes included Nursing and Non-nursing Staff Support, Positive Child/Family Experiences, Logistical Help and Social Resources, Blood Bank and Access to Blood, and Transfusion-Specific Resources. Discussion: The comprehensive understanding of multilevel barriers and facilitators to transfusion therapy, including the role of nursing, in children with SCA can inform strategies to improve CRCT for patients/families and providers and can also be applied by organizations seeking to implement transfusion services for SCA.
35244950	cause|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Constriction_Pathologic ;treat|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell	Accuracy of transcranial Doppler in detecting intracranial stenosis in patients with sickle cell anemia when compared to magnetic resonance angiography.BACKGROUND: Stroke, the most devastating consequence of sickle cell anemia (SCA), is associated with endothelial damage and intracranial artery stenosis. We aimed to assess transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound accuracy in detecting intracranial stenosis when compared to magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). METHODS: Children with SCA and at least one TCD and MRA within 1 month were identified from a retrospectively collected database. Sensitivity and specificity were obtained to assess the overall accuracy of TCD mean flow velocity (mFV) >=200 cm/s in detecting vessel stenosis of >=50%. Multivariate analysis identified independent factors associated with MRA stenosis. RESULTS: Among 157 patients in the database, 64 had a TCD and MRA within 1 month (age 11.8 +- 5.3 years, 56% female, 20% with cerebral infarcts on MRI, 8 or 13% had mFV >=200 cm/s and 20% or 21%, had intracranial stenosis >=50% on MRA). TCD mFV >=200 cm/s had a high specificity (95%) but low sensitivity (29%) to detecting intracranial stenosis. As a continuous variable, TCD mFV of 137.5 cm/s had maximal specificity (77%) and sensitivity (72%). After adjustment for age, hemoglobin level, transfusion status, hydroxyurea treatment, and vessel, for every increase in cm/sec on TCD, there was a 2% increase in the odds of >=50% stenosis on MRA (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our study reports TCD mFV is a positive predictor of MRA stenosis in SCA, independent of patient characteristics, including hemoglobin. A mFV >=200 cm/s is highly specific but less sensitive in detecting stenosis >=50%. Lower mFV cut points may be needed for the early detection of intracranial stenosis.
33723587		Pain-Related Injustice Appraisals in Youth with Sickle Cell Disease: A Preliminary Investigation.OBJECTIVES: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder that affects approximately 100,000 Americans, the majority of whom are African American. SCD-related pain often has deleterious effects on functioning and quality of life. The inherited nature of SCD, SCD-related stigma, and serious physical and functional impact of SCD-related pain create a situation ripe for individuals to appraise their SCD-related pain as unfair or unjust. The aim of this preliminary investigation is to explore the extent to which pediatric patients with SCD appraise their pain as unjust and how these appraisals relate to functioning. METHODS: Participants were youth with SCD (N = 30, mean age = 11.3, 57% boys) who attended a hematology clinic visit. Patients were invited to complete paper-based questionnaires assessing pain-related injustice appraisals, pain catastrophizing, pain and hurt, functional disability, depression, anxiety, and peer relationships. RESULTS: Results of hierarchical regressions indicate that pain-related injustice significantly predicted functional disability, depression, and anxiety after controlling for patient pain and catastrophizing. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that pain-related injustice appraisals are an important contributor to the pain experience of youth with SCD. Early identification and remediation of pain-related injustice appraisals could have long-term functional benefits for youth with SCD.
35997659		Identifying Chronic Pain Subgroups in Pediatric Sickle Cell Disease: A Cluster-Analytic Approach.OBJECTIVES: Youth with sickle cell disease (SCD) and chronic pain, defined in this study as pain on most days for 3 months, experience variability in daily pain and physical and psychosocial functioning. This study aimed to (1) empirically derive chronic pain subgroups based on pain characteristics among youth with chronic SCD pain; and (2) investigate derived subgroups for differences in sociodemographics, clinical characteristics, and psychosocial and functional outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Youth with chronic SCD pain (n=62, Mage =13.9, SD=2.5, 10 to 18 y; 58% female, 60% HbSS) completed a battery of questionnaires. Clinical characteristics (eg, medications, treatments) and health care utilization were abstracted from electronic medical records. Hierarchical cluster analysis informed the number of clusters at the patient level. k-means cluster analysis used multidimensional pain assessment to identify and assign patients to clusters. RESULTS: Cluster 1 (n=35; Moderate Frequency, Moderate Pain) demonstrated significantly lower worst pain intensity, number of pain days per month, number of body sites affected by pain, and pain quality ratings. Cluster 2 (n=27; Almost Daily, High Pain) reported high ratings of worst pain intensity, almost daily to daily pain, greater number of body sites affected by pain, and higher ratings of pain quality (all P 's <0.05). There were no differences between subgroups by sociodemographics, clinical characteristics, or health care utilization. The Almost Daily, High Pain subgroup reported significantly higher pain interference, depressive symptoms, and pain catastrophizing than the Moderate Frequency, Moderate Pain subgroup. DISCUSSION: Identifying chronic SCD pain subgroups may inform tailored assessment and intervention to mitigate poor pain and functional outcomes.
37742907	treat|@CHEMICAL_Buprenorphine|@DISEASE_Chronic_Pain ;treat|@CHEMICAL_Buprenorphine|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell	"Buprenorphine, It Works so Differently": Adults with Sickle Cell Disease Describe Transitioning to Buprenorphine for Treatment of Chronic Pain.A growing body of literature describes the use of buprenorphine for the treatment of chronic pain in people with sickle cell disease. The experiences of people with sickle cell disease who have tried buprenorphine are not yet reported. This qualitative descriptive study was conducted to explore perspectives on buprenorphine for chronic pain in sickle cell disease. We interviewed 13 participants with sickle cell disease who had been prescribed buprenorphine and had a clinic visit between December 1, 2020 and April, 2022 in our Sickle Cell Center for Adults. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis. Eleven out of 13 participants were taking buprenorphine at the time of the interview, with mean treatment duration of 33 months (SD 18, range 7 to 78 months). Five major themes were identified: 1) dissatisfaction with full agonist opioids; 2) navigating uncertainty with autonomy in deciding to try buprenorphine; 3) functional and relational changes after starting buprenorphine, 4) enduring systemic barriers to pain treatment, and 5) trusting treatment relationships are necessary when approaching patients about buprenorphine. The experience of adulthood living with sickle cell disease before and after starting buprenorphine is qualitatively different with significant improvements in social functioning. PERSPECTIVE: This study examined the experience of adults with sickle cell disease and chronic pain transitioning from full agonist opioids to buprenorphine. It is the first qualitative study of buprenorphine in people with sickle cell disease, contributing to a small but growing literature about buprenorphine and sickle cell disease.
38246166		A new frontier: FDA approvals for gene therapy in sickle cell disease.
34035408		Cost-effectiveness of a hypothetical cell or gene therapy cure for sickle cell disease.Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of inherited genetic conditions associated with lifelong complications and increased healthcare resource utilization. Standard treatment for SCD in the US varies based on stage of the disease and observed clinical severity. In this study, we aim to evaluate the potential cost-effectiveness of a durable cell or gene therapy cure for sickle cell disease from the US healthcare sector perspective. We developed a lifetime Markov model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a hypothetical single-administration durable treatment (DT) for SCD provided at birth, relative to standard of care (SOC). We informed model inputs including direct healthcare costs, health state utility weights, transition probabilities, and mortality rates using a retrospective database analysis of commercially insured individuals and the medical literature. Our primary outcome of interest was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of DT versus SOC evaluated at a base case willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $150,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). We tested the robustness of our base case findings through scenario, deterministic sensitivity (DSA), and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA). In the base case analysis, treatment with DT was cost-effective with an ICER of $140,877/QALY relative to SOC for a hypothetical cohort involving 47% females. Both males (ICER of $135,574/QALY) and females (ICER of $146,511/QALY) were similarly cost-effective to treat. In univariate DSA the base case ICER was most sensitive to the costs of treating males, DT treatment cost, and the discount rate. In PSA, DT was cost-effective in 32.7%, 66.0%, and 92.6% of 10,000 simulations at WTP values of $100,000, $150,000, and $200,000 per QALY, respectively. A scenario analysis showed cost-effectiveness of DT is highly contingent on assumed lifetime durability of the cure. A hypothetical cell or gene therapy cure for SCD is likely to be cost-effective from the US healthcare sector perspective. Large upfront costs of a single administration cure are offset by significant downstream gains in health for patients treated early in life. We find cost-effectiveness outcomes do not vary substantially by gender; however, several model parameters including assumed durability and upfront cost of DT are likely to influence cost-effectiveness findings.

Sickle cell disease, the most common genetic disease in France, is still burdened with morbidity and early mortality before the age of 50. When the first-line treatment, hydroxyurea, is insufficient or in the case of organic damage(s) (in particular cerebral vasculopathy), a therapeutic intensification must be considered. New molecules are now available, such as voxelotor and crizanlizumab, but only hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation can cure the disease. Allogeneic HSC transplantation during childhood with a sibling donor is the reference but it is now possible to perform this procedure in adults with a reduced pre-transplant conditioning. Gene therapy, which consists of an autograft of genetically modified HSCs, has obtained promising results but has not yet demonstrated a complete cure of the disease (protocols underway). The toxicity of myeloablative conditioning (used in pediatrics or for gene therapy), particularly the sterility induced, and the risk of graft-versushost disease (for allogeneic transplantation) are limiting factors of these treatments.

Evidence is lacking that assesses how split daily buprenorphine-naloxone affects OUD outcomes. This study aims to evaluate how the dosing frequency of SL buprenorphine-naloxone impacts therapy effectiveness when treating patients with OUD. METHODS: This retrospective analysis included adult outpatients prescribed treatment with SL buprenorphine-naloxone for OUD between July 1, 2016, and March 1, 2020. The study excluded patients with sickle cell disease, recent methadone treatment, or pregnancy. We characterized study groups by dosing frequency, either once daily or split dosing. The study compared retention in treatment, medication adherence, adherence to treatment program, and hospital encounters between groups. RESULTS: The study screened eight-hundred and seven patients, and included 250 patients newly prescribed SL buprenorphine-naloxone. Fifty-seven patients (22.8 %) were prescribed once daily dosing and 193 patients (77.2 %) were prescribed split daily dosing. The study found no significant differences noted in 12-month rates of treatment retention (52.6 % vs. 45.6 %, p = .35). These outcomes remained similar when assessed at three and six months. Within a year of buprenorphine-naloxone initiation, the study found no differences in the percentage of patients with hospitalizations (26.3 % vs. 38.3 %, p = .10), median number of hospitalizations (2 vs. 2), or proportion of days covered by a prescription >=80 % (93.3 % vs. 92.0 %, p = .82). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, patients receiving once daily buprenorphine-naloxone had similar treatment outcomes to patients receiving split dosing. Further controlled studies are necessary to evaluate which patients are more likely to benefit from split dosing.
34669783		Comparative metavirome analysis in polytransfused patients.Due to the high transfusion volume, polytransfused patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and beta-thalassemia are constantly exposed to parenterally transmitted infections. Currently, we have little information about the virome of such patients and how the virological composition might be influenced by the hemotherapy procedures that these patients receive. The objective of this study was to compare the viral diversity between these two groups with respect to the viral abundance and how it might be affected by the specific conditions of these groups. We sequenced by next-generation sequencing (NGS) and compared the virome of 30 patients with beta-thalassemia major, 45 with SCD, and 16 blood donors from the Blood Center of Ribeirao Preto, Brazil. Predominantly, commensal viruses including Torque teno virus (TTV) genotypes and human pegiviris-1 (HPgV-1) were identified in each group. Strikingly, while HPgV-1 reads were dominant in the SCD group, thalassemic patients showed high TTV abundance, expressed both in viral reads and genotypes. We speculated that the commensal virome of polytransfused patients might be influenced by the transfusion frequency and disease characteristics and that commensal viruses might be used as important genetic biomarkers for these hematological disturbances. Nevertheless, more specific studies are necessary to confirm a relationship between blood virome and transfusion treatment.
33827305		Central macular thickness in patients with sickle cell disease and no signs of retinopathy: a cross-sectional study of Jordanian patients.OBJECTIVES: To measure central macular thickness in Jordanian patients with sickle cell disease who did not have retinopathy and compare the findings with age- and sex-matched controls using spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SDOCT). METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, participants underwent visual acuity testing, slit-lamp bio-microscopy, dilated ophthalmoscopy, and SDOCT imaging to measure central macular thickness. Macular quadrant measurements and thickness difference indexes (TDIs) were compared between groups. RESULTS: Twenty eyes with sickle cell disease and 20 control eyes were enrolled. The median visual acuity in both groups was 20/20. The mean macular thickness was significantly lower in eyes with sickle cell disease than in matched controls (mean difference, 22.15 +- 6.44 microm). Peripheral quadrants were all significantly thinner in eyes with sickle cell disease, especially in superior and temporal quadrants. TDIs were lower in eyes with sickle cell disease than in control eyes. CONCLUSIONS: Eyes with sickle cell disease that had no clinical evidence of retinopathy exhibited significantly lower central macular thickness in all quadrants, compared with eyes in age- and sex-matched controls. SDOCT is a non-invasive imaging modality that can detect preclinical changes in eyes with sickle cell disease and can be used to screen and monitor the disease process.
38308541		Adverse pregnancy, fetal and neonatal outcomes in women with sickle cell disease in a Middle Eastern country.BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease in pregnancy is associated with high maternal and fetal mortality. However, studies reporting pregnancy, fetal, and neonatal outcomes in women with sickle cell disease are extremely limited. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of the study are to determine whether women with sickle cell disease have a greater risk of adverse pregnancy, fetal, and neonatal outcomes than women without sickle cell disease and identify the predictors of adverse pregnancy, fetal, and neonatal outcomes in women with sickle cell disease. DESIGN: A retrospective pair-matched case-control study was conducted to compare 171 pregnant women with sickle cell disease to 171 pregnant women without sickle cell disease in Muscat, Sultanate of Oman. METHODS: All pregnant Omani women with sickle cell disease who delivered between January 2015 and August 2021 at Sultan Qaboos University Hospital and Royal Hospital, who were either primipara or multipara and who had a gestational age of 24-42 weeks, were included as patients, whereas women who had no sickle cell disease or any comorbidity during pregnancy, who delivered within the same timeframe and at the same hospitals, were recruited as controls. The data were retrieved from electronic medical records and delivery registry books between January 2015 and August 2021. RESULTS: Women with sickle cell disease who had severe anemia had increased odds of (chi2 = 58.56, p < 0.001) having adverse pregnancy outcomes. Women with sickle cell disease had 21.97% higher odds of delivering a baby with intrauterine growth retardation (chi2 = 17.80, unadjusted odds ratio = 2.91-166.13, p < 0.001). Newborns born to women with sickle cell disease had 3.93% greater odds of being admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (chi2 = 16.80, unadjusted odds ratio = 1.97-7.84, p < 0.001). In addition, the children born to women with sickle cell disease had 10.90% higher odds of being born with low birth weight (chi2 = 56.92, unadjusted odds ratio = 5.36-22.16, p < 0.001). Hemoglobin level (odds ratio = 0.17, p < 0.001, 95% confidence interval = 0.10-3.0), past medical history (odds ratio = 7.95, p < 0.001, 95% confidence interval = 2.39-26.43), past surgical history (odds ratio = 17.69, p < 0.001, 95% confidence interval = 3.41-91.76), and preterm delivery (odds ratio = 9.48, p = 0.005, 95% confidence interval = 1.95-46.23) were identified as predictors of adverse pregnancy, fetal, and neonatal outcomes in women with sickle cell disease. CONCLUSION: As pregnant women with sickle cell disease are at increased risk for pregnancy, fetal, and neonatal adverse outcomes; improved antenatal surveillance and management may improve the outcomes.
37083273		COVID-19 Infection and Outcomes in Newborn Screening Cohorts of Sickle Cell Trait and Sickle Cell Disease in Michigan and Georgia.The sickle cell mutation increases morbidity in those with sickle cell disease (SCD) and potentially sickle cell trait, impacting pulmonary, coagulation, renal, and other systems that are implicated in COVID-19 severity. There are no population-based registries for hemoglobinopathies, and they are not tracked in COVID-19 testing. We used COVID-19 test data from 2 states linked to newborn screening data to estimate COVID outcomes in people with SCD or trait compared with normal hemoglobin. We linked historical newborn screening data to COVID-19 tests, hospitalization, and mortality data and modeled the odds of hospitalization and mortality. Georgia's cohort aged 0 to 12 years; Michigan's, 0 to 33 years. Over 8% of those in Michigan were linked to positive COVID-19 results, and 4% in Georgia. Those with SCD showed significantly higher rates of COVID-19 hospitalization than the normal hemoglobin Black cohort, and Michigan had higher rates of mortality as well. Outcomes among those with the trait did not differ significantly from the normal hemoglobin Black group. People with SCD are at increased risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization and mortality and are encouraged to be vaccinated and avoid infection. Persons with the trait were not at higher risk of COVID-related severe outcomes.
34668604		Evaluation of Hepatic Iron Overload Using a Contemporary 0.55 T MRI System.BACKGROUND: MRI T2* and R2* mapping have gained clinical acceptance for noninvasive assessment of iron overload. Lower field MRI may offer increased measurement dynamic range in patients with high iron concentration and may potentially increase MRI accessibility, but it is compromised by lower signal-to-noise ratio that reduces measurement precision. PURPOSE: To characterize a high-performance 0.55 T MRI system for evaluating patients with liver iron overload. STUDY TYPE: Prospective. POPULATION: Forty patients with known or suspected iron overload (sickle cell anemia [n = 5], ss-thalassemia [n = 3], and hereditary spherocytosis [n = 2]) and a liver iron phantom. FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: A breath-held multiecho gradient echo sequence at 0.55 T and 1.5 T. ASSESSMENT: Patients were imaged with T2*/R2* mapping 0.55 T and 1.5 T within 24 hours, and 16 patients returned for follow-up exams within 6-16 months, resulting in 56 paired studies. Liver T2* and R2* measurements and standard deviations were compared between 0.55 T and 1.5 T and used to validate a predictive model between field strengths. The model was then used to classify iron overload at 0.55 T. STATISTICAL TESTS: Linear regression and Bland-Altman analysis were used for comparisons, and measurement precision was assessed using the coefficient of variation. A P-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: R2* was significantly lower at 0.55 T in our cohort (488 +- 449 s-1 at 1.5 T vs. 178 +- 155 s-1 at 0.55 T, n = 56 studies) and in the patients with severe iron overload (937 +- 369 s-1 at 1.5 T vs. 339 +- 127 s-1 at 0.55 T, n = 23 studies). The coefficient of variation indicated reduced precision at 0.55 T (3.5 +- 2.2% at 1.5 T vs 6.9 +- 3.9% at 0.55 T). The predictive model accurately predicted 1.5 T R2* from 0.55 T R2* (Bland Altman bias = -6.6 +- 20.5%). Using this model, iron overload at 0.55 T was classified as: severe R2* > 185 s-1 , moderate 81 s-1  < R2* < 185 s-1 , and mild 45 s-1  < R2* < 91 s-1 . DATA CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that 0.55 T provides T2* and R2* maps that can be used for the assessment of liver iron overload in patients. EVIDENCE LEVEL: 2 TECHNICAL EFFICACY: Stage 2.
36018254		Simple open-heart surgery protocol for sickle-cell disease patients: a retrospective cohort study comparing patients undergoing mitral valve surgery.OBJECTIVES: Sickle-cell disease (SCD) patients are considered to be at high risk from open-heart surgery. This study assessed the role of a simple sickling-prevention protocol. METHODS: Perioperative non-specific and SCD-specific morbidity and 30-day mortality are investigated in a retrospective cohort study on patients undergoing isolated mitral valve surgery. Patients with and without SCD were compared. In the SCD cohort, a bundle of interventions was applied to limit the risk of sickling: 'on-demand' transfusions to keep haemoglobin levels of around 7-8 g/dl, cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) with higher blood flow and perfusion temperature, close monitoring of acid-base balance and oxygenation. RESULTS: Twenty patients with and 40 patients without SCD were included. At baseline, only preoperative haemoglobin levels differed between cohorts (8.1 vs 11.8 g/dl, P < 0.001). Solely SCD patients received preoperative transfusions (45.0%). Intraoperative transfusions were significantly larger in SCD patients during CPB (priming: 300 vs 200 ml; entire length: 600 vs 300 ml and 20 vs 10 ml/kg). SCD patients had higher perfusion temperatures during CPB (34.7 vs 33.0 C, P = 0.01) with consequently higher pharyngeal temperature, both during cooling (34.1 vs 32.3 C, P = 0.02) and rewarming (36.5 vs 36.2 C, P = 0.02). No mortality occurred, and non-SCD-specific complications were comparable between groups, but one SCD patient suffered from perioperative cerebrovascular accident with seizures, and another had evident haemolysis. CONCLUSIONS: SCD patients may undergo open-heart surgery for mitral valve procedures with an acceptable risk profile. Simple but thoughtful perioperative management, embracing 'on-demand' transfusions and less-aggressive CPB cooling is feasible and probably efficacious.
34472094		Which adults with sickle cell disease need an evaluation for pulmonary embolism?Individuals living with sickle cell disease (SCD) are at an increased risk of venous thrombo-embolism (VTE) including pulmonary embolisms (PEs). There is a high mortality associated with PE in individuals with SCD. It can be difficult to diagnose PE since presenting symptoms of PE often mimic those of other forms of vaso-occlusive crisis in SCD. Currently, there are no validated models for predicting PEs in patients with sickle cell disease, which often leads to frequent CT scans and exposure to harmful radiation and intravenous contrast. The aim of this study was to evaluate different host variables and potential clinical biomarkers of patients with SCD including those used in the Wells score to assess predictability for PE in order to create a more accurate diagnostic algorithm to predict PE. A retrospective chart review was performed on 349 patients with SCD who underwent testing for a PE with a CT scan of the chest. Forward and backward stepwise model selection was performed to obtain a parsimonious model of the predictors of PEs. The incidence of PE in this population was 9 7%. Of the factors evaluated for this study, the Wells score was the only one with clinical significance. A Wells score greater than 4 had a sensitivity and specificity of 72 5% and 70 1%, respectively, and a score greater than 6 had a sensitivity and specificity of 50% and 87%, respectively. The Wells score is an acceptable clinical tool which may prove useful in individuals with SCD to predict who is most likely to have a PE and therefore should undergo a CT scan. A prospective study is needed to further confirm these findings.

34854548		Trends in quality of care among children with sickle cell anemia.INTRODUCTION: For decades, it has been recommended that children with sickle cell anemia (SCA) receive antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent serious infections and undergo transcranial Doppler (TCD) screening to identify those at highest risk of overt stroke. We assessed recent temporal trends in antibiotic prophylaxis prescription fills and TCD screening among children with SCA using validated quality measures. PROCEDURE: Using validated claims-based definitions, we identified children with SCA who were enrolled in Michigan or New York State (NYS) Medicaid programs (2011-2018). Among recommended age groups, two outcomes were assessed yearly: (a) filling of >=300 days of antibiotics, and (b) receipt of greater than or equal to one TCD. The proportion of children with each outcome was calculated by state. Temporal trends in each preventive service were assessed using generalized linear models. RESULTS: A total of 1784 children were eligible for antibiotic prophylaxis (Michigan: 384; NYS: 1400), contributing 3322 person-years. Annual rates of filling >=300 days of antibiotics ranged from 16% to 22% and were similar by state. There was no change in rates of antibiotic filling over time in Michigan (p-value: .10), but there was a decrease in NYS (p-value: .02). A total of 3439 children with SCA were eligible for TCD screening (Michigan: 710; NYS: 2729), contributing 10,012 person-years. Annual rates of TCD screening ranged from 39% to 45%, were similar by state, and did not change over time (p-values >.05). CONCLUSIONS: Most children with SCA do not receive recommended antibiotic prophylaxis and/or TCD screening. New, sustainable, and coordinated interventions across preventive services are urgently needed.
37982216		Silent Cerebral Infarcts in Iraqi Patients with Sickle Cell Disease.Silent ischemic infarcts have been reported to be the most frequent neurological abnormalities in sickle cell disease (SCD) in several studies worldwide. However, no previous studies investigated this neurological disorder in Iraqi SCD patients. To address this issue, a total of 52 patients with a median age of 20 years (range 10-46) and including 46.2% males were enrolled. Patients were clinically evaluated and their records were reviewed. They had full blood and reticulocyte counts, hemoglobin F estimation, serum lactic dehydrogenase and bilirubin assayed, as well as brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to screen for silent cerebral infarcts. Six out of the 52 patients (11.5%) had silent cerebral infarcts, all of which were in the deep white matter, ranging from 6 to 10 mm in their largest diameters. There were no significant differences in age, sex, or sickle cell genotype between those with silent cerebral infarcts and those without it. Those with silent cerebral infarcts had lower median hemoglobin, higher reticulocytes and lower pain frequencies than those without it, yet again this was not significant. Follow up MRI in four out of the six silent infarct patients showed no additional lesions and no increase in size of the original ones after six to eight months. In conclusion, it appears that the frequency of silent cerebral infarcts in Iraqi SCD patients is lower than the bulk of the literature from other populations. Further studies to screen for genetic polymorphisms that may explain this lower rate may be informative.

A previous phase 3 trial of poloxamer 188 reported shortened duration of painful vaso-occlusive episodes in SCD, particularly in children and participants treated with hydroxyurea. Objective: To reassess the efficacy of poloxamer 188 for vaso-occlusive episodes. Design, Setting, and Participants: Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, international trial conducted from May 2013 to February 2016 that included 66 hospitals in 12 countries and 60 cities; 388 individuals with SCD (hemoglobin SS, SC, S-beta0 thalassemia, or S-beta+ thalassemia disease) aged 4 to 65 years with acute moderate to severe pain typical of painful vaso-occlusive episodes requiring hospitalization were included. Interventions: A 1-hour 100-mg/kg loading dose of poloxamer 188 intravenously followed by a 12-hour to 48-hour 30-mg/kg/h continuous infusion (n = 194) or placebo (n = 194). Main Outcomes and Measures: Time in hours from randomization to the last dose of parenteral opioids among all participants and among those younger than 16 years as a separate subgroup. Results: Of 437 participants assessed for eligibility, 388 were randomized (mean age, 15.2 years; 176 [45.4%] female), the primary outcome was available for 384 (99.0%), 15-day follow-up contacts were available for 357 (92.0%), and 30-day follow-up contacts were available for 368 (94.8%). There was no significant difference between the groups for the mean time to last dose of parenteral opioids (81.8 h for the poloxamer 188 group vs 77.8 h for the placebo group; difference, 4.0 h [95% CI, -7.8 to 15.7]; geometric mean ratio, 1.2 [95% CI, 1.0-1.5]; P = .09). Based on a significant interaction of age and treatment (P = .01), there was a treatment difference in time from randomization to last administration of parenteral opioids for participants younger than 16 years (88.7 h in the poloxamer 188 group vs 71.9 h in the placebo group; difference, 16.8 h [95% CI, 1.7-32.0]; geometric mean ratio, 1.4 [95% CI, 1.1-1.8]; P = .008). Adverse events that were more common in the poloxamer 188 group than the placebo group included hyperbilirubinemia (12.7% vs 5.2%); those more common in the placebo group included hypoxia (12.0% vs 5.3%). Conclusions and Relevance: Among children and adults with SCD, poloxamer 188 did not significantly shorten time to last dose of parenteral opioids during vaso-occlusive episodes. These findings do not support the use of poloxamer 188 for vaso-occlusive episodes. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01737814.
34470050	stimulate|@DISEASE_Malaria|@GENE_ANGPT2	Decreased parasite burden and altered host response in children with sickle cell anemia and severe anemia with malaria.Plasmodium falciparum malaria causes morbidity and mortality in African children with sickle cell anemia (SCA), but comparisons of host responses to P falciparum between children with SCA (homozygous sickle cell disease/hemoglobin SS [HbSS]) and normal hemoglobin genotype/hemoglobin AA (HbAA) are limited. We assessed parasite biomass and plasma markers of inflammation and endothelial activation in children with HbAA (n = 208) or HbSS (n = 22) who presented with severe anemia and P falciparum parasitemia to Mulago Hospital in Kampala, Uganda. Genotyping was performed at study completion. No child had known SCA at enrollment. Children with HbSS did not differ from children with HbAA in peripheral parasite density, but had significantly lower sequestered parasite biomass. Children with HbSS had greater leukocytosis but significantly lower concentrations of several plasma inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). In contrast, children with HbSS had threefold greater concentrations of angiopoietin-2 (Angpt-2), a marker of endothelial dysregulation associated with mortality in severe malaria. Lower TNF-alpha concentrations were associated with increased risk of postdischarge mortality or readmission, whereas higher Angpt-2 concentrations were associated with increased risk of recurrent clinical malaria. Children with SCA have decreased parasite sequestration and inflammation but increased endothelial dysregulation during severe anemia with P falciparum parasitemia, which may ameliorate acute infectious complications but predispose to harmful long-term sequelae.

This role of hemopexin is critical in hemolytic pathophysiology. In this review, we outline the current research regarding how the dynamic activity of hemopexin is implicated in sickle cell disease, which is characterized by a pathological aggregation of red blood cells and excessive hemolysis. This pathophysiology leads to symptoms such as acute kidney injury, vaso-occlusion, ischemic stroke, pain crises, and pulmonary hypertension exacerbated by the presence of free heme and hemoglobin. This review includes in vivo studies in mouse, rat, and guinea pig models of sickle cell disease, as well as studies in human samples. In summary, the current research indicates that hemopexin is likely protective against these symptoms and that rectifying depleted hemopexin in patients with sickle cell disease could improve or prevent the symptoms. The data compiled in this review suggest that further preclinical and clinical research should be conducted to uncover pathways of hemopexin in pathological states to evaluate its potential clinical function as both a biomarker and therapy for sickle cell disease and related hemoglobinopathies.
33668588	stimulate|@DISEASE_Hypoxia|@GENE_EPO	Mechanisms of Bone Impairment in Sickle Bone Disease.Sickle bone disease (SBD) is a chronic and invalidating complication of Sickle cell disease (SCD), a multisystem autosomal recessive genetic disorder affecting millions of people worldwide. Mechanisms involved in SBD are not completely known, especially in pediatric age. Among the hypothesized pathogenetic mechanisms underlying SBD are bone marrow compensatory hyperplasia and bone ischemic damage, both secondary to vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC), which leads to cell sickling, thus worsening local hypoxia with a negative impact on osteoblast recruitment. Furthermore, the hypoxia is a strong activator of erythropoietin, which in turn stimulates osteoclast precursors and induces bone loss. Hemolysis and iron overload due to a chronic transfusion regimen could also contribute to the onset of bone complications. Vitamin D deficiency, which is frequently seen in SCD subjects, may worsen SBD by increasing the resorptive state that is responsible for low bone mineral density, acute/chronic bone pain, and high fracture risk. An imbalance between osteoblasts and osteoclasts, with a relative decrease of osteoblast recruitment and activity, is a further possible mechanism responsible for the impairment of bone health in SCD. Moreover, delayed pubertal growth spurt and low peak bone mass may explain the high incidence of fracture in SCD adolescents. The aim of this review was to focus on the pathogenesis of SBD, updating the studies on biochemical, instrumental, and biological markers of bone metabolism. We also evaluated the growth development and endocrine complications in subjects affected with SCD.

Our objective was to assess the use and impact of intranasal fentanyl for the treatment of children with SCD-VOE on discharge from the emergency department in a multicenter study. We conducted a cross-sectional study at 20 academic pediatric emergency departments in the United States and Canada. We used logistic regression to test bivariable and multivariable associations between the outcome of discharge from the emergency department and candidate variables theoretically associated with discharge. The study included 400 patients; 215 (54%) were female. The median age was 14.6 (interquartile range 9.8, 17.6) years. Nineteen percent (n = 75) received intranasal fentanyl in the emergency department. Children who received intranasal fentanyl had nearly nine-fold greater adjusted odds of discharge from the emergency department compared to those who did not (adjusted odds ratio 8.99, 95% CI 2.81-30.56, p < .001). The rapid onset of action and ease of delivery without intravenous access offered by intranasal fentanyl make it a feasible initial parenteral analgesic in the treatment of children with SCD presenting with VOE in the acute-care setting. Further study is needed to determine potential causality of the association between intranasal fentanyl and discharge from the emergency department observed in this multicenter study.
34001792		Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in a Pediatric Patient With Sickle Cell Disease and COVID-19: A Case Report.To this day, there are limited data about the effects and management of coronavirus disease infection in pediatric patients with sickle cell disease.

35139577		Main Complications during Pregnancy and Recommendations for Adequate Antenatal Care in Sickle Cell Disease: A Literature Review.Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common monogenic disease worldwide, with a variable prevalence in each continent. A single nucleotide substitution leads to an amino-acid change in the beta-globin chain, altering the normal structure ofhemoglobin, which is then called hemoglobin S inherited in homozygosity (HbSS) or double heterozygosity (HbSC, HbSbeta), and leads to chronic hemolysis, vaso-occlusion, inflammation, and endothelium activation. Pregnant women with SCD are at a higher risk of developing maternal and perinatal complications. We performed a narrative review of the literature considering SCD and pregnancy, the main clinical and obstetrical complications, the specific antenatal care, and the follow-up for maternal and fetal surveillance. Pregnant women with SCD are at a higher risk of developing clinical and obstetric complications such as pain episodes, pulmonary complications, infections, thromboembolic events, preeclampsia, and maternal death. Their newborns are also at an increased risk of developing neonatal complications: fetal growth restriction, preterm birth, stillbirth. Severe complications can occur in patients of any genotype. We concluded that SCD is a high-risk condition that increases maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. A multidisciplinary approach during pregnancy and the postpartum period is key to adequately diagnose and treat complications.
34294525		Treatment and outcomes of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with Sickle cell disease: a population-based study in the U.S.BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a rare hemoglobinopathy which can result in chronic liver disease and cirrhosis. Patients with SCD have an increased risk of hematologic malignancy, but the prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in this population is unknown. Herein, the association of SCD with HCC was examined using registry data. METHODS: The SEER-Medicare database was queried to identify patients diagnosed with HCC between 2000 and 2015, and further stratified by SCD status. Propensity matching was performed to examine cancer-related survival and treatment outcomes. RESULTS: Overall 56,934 patients with HCC were identified, including 81 patients with SCD. Patients with SCD more frequently had cirrhosis [48.1% (39/81) vs 23.5% (13,377/56,853), p < 0.01] yet presented with smaller tumors [<5 cm: 51.9% (42/81) vs 38.5% (21,898/56,853), p = 0.01]. After propensity matching, SCD was not associated with attenuated survival (aHR 0.73 95%CI 0.52-1.01). When stratified by treatment, patients with SCD had equivalent outcomes to chemotherapy (p = 0.65), TACE/TARE (p = 0.35), resection (p = 0.15) and transplantation (p = 0.67) when compared to non-SCD patients. CONCLUSION: This study confirms that a subset of patients with SCD will develop HCC. Importantly, therapeutic options for HCC should not be limited by pre-existing SCD, and similar survival should be expected when compared to non-SCD patients.

Hydroxyurea, a disease-modifying therapy for sickle cell anemia, has been used for several decades. Longitudinal assessment of echocardiographic abnormalities in children and young adults with sickle cell anemia receiving hydroxyurea therapy is lacking. The goal of this retrospective study was to determine the prevalence of echocardiographic abnormalities in children and young adults with sickle cell anemia and to examine the effects of hydroxyurea on reverse cardiac remodeling. We reviewed the records of patients with sickle cell anemia who underwent routine cardiac screening at Cohen Children's Medical Center between 2010 and 2017, followed by retrospective longitudinal analysis of echocardiograms performed on patients receiving treatment with hydroxyurea. Data on a total of 100 patients with sickle cell anemia were analyzed; 60 (60%) were being treated with hydroxyurea. Twenty-five (41.6%) of the patients on hydroxyurea had been treated for <1 year; these patients had a significantly greater prevalence of left ventricular dilation compared with those who had been on treatment for >1 year. Serial echocardiograms of patients receiving hydroxyurea were then analyzed. Left ventricular dilation and hypertrophy improved significantly with hydroxyurea treatment. In addition, the left ventricular volume and mass correlated negatively with duration of treatment with hydroxyurea. Our study provides evidence that prolonged hydroxyurea therapy may lead to reverse cardiac remodeling. Future studies should attempt to follow up this patient cohort for a longer duration.

37023228	treat|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell	Proinflammatory state promotes red blood cell alloimmunization in pediatric patients with sickle cell disease.We examined risk factors for RBC alloimmunization in pediatric patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), focusing on recipients' inflammatory state at the time of transfusion and anti-inflammatory role of hydroxyurea (HU). Among 471 participants, 55 (11.70%) participants were alloimmunized and formed 59 alloantibodies and 17 autoantibodies with an alloimmunization rate of 0.36 alloantibodies per 100 units. Analysis of 27 participants who formed alloantibodies with specificities showed 23.8% (30/126) of units transfused during a proinflammatory event resulted in alloantibody formation compared to 2.8% (27/952) of units transfused at steady state. Therefore, transfusion during proinflammatory events increased the risk for alloimmunization (odds ratio [OR]: 4.22; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.64-10.85; p = 0.003). Further analysis of all the 471 participants showed alloimmunization of episodically transfused patients who received transfusion mostly during proinflammatory events was not reduced by HU therapy (OR: 6.52; 95% CI: 0.85-49.77; p = 0.071), HU therapy duration (OR: 1.13; 95% CI: 0.997-1.28; p = 0.056) or HU dose (OR: 1.06; 95% CI: 0.96-1.16; p = 0.242). The analysis also identified high transfusion burden (OR: 1.02; 95% CI: 1.003-1.04; p = 0.020) and HbSS and HbSbeta0-thalassemia genotypes (OR: 11.22, 95% CI: 1.51-83.38, p = 0.018) as additional risk factors for alloimmunization. In conclusion, the inflammatory state of transfusion recipients affects the risk of RBC alloimmunization, which is not modified by HU therapy. Judicious use of transfusion during proinflammatory events is critical for preventing alloimmunization.
36762634	treat|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Stroke	Stroke in the young.PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to review recent findings regarding stroke epidemiology, etiologies, and treatment in children and young adults. RECENT FINDINGS: Incidence in young adults is increasing, and incidence, recurrence, and survival is worse in patients with cryptogenic stroke and in developing countries. Careful consideration of patent foramen ovale closure is now recommended in young adults with cryptogenic stroke. Thrombectomy has recently been extended to carefully selected children with acute ischemic stroke, and two recent publications strongly suggest that it can be beneficial for children. Sickle cell is also an important global contributor to stroke burden, but hydroxyurea can be a cost effective medication for stroke prevention in children. Recent advances in genetic testing and treatments may improve outcomes for patients with monogenic causes of stroke, such as deficiency of adenosine deaminase 2, hemophilia, and Fabry's disease. SUMMARY: Stroke in children and young adults is a morbid disease responsible for enormous indirect societal costs and a high burden of years with disability per affected patient. Recent advances have improved access to care for children with large vessel occlusion and adults with rare causes of stroke. Future research may bring effective treatments for other monogenic causes of stroke as well as increasing access to hyperacute therapies for young stroke patients.

METHODS: Control participants and patients with SCD underwent brain MRI to quantify cerebral blood flow (CBF), oxygen extraction fraction (OEF), mean diffusivity (MD), and fractional anisotropy (FA) within normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) and infarcts on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery. Multivariable linear regression examined the patient- and voxel-based associations between hemodynamic and metabolic stress (defined as elevated CBF and OEF, respectively), white matter microstructure, and infarct location. RESULTS: Of 83 control participants and patients with SCD, adults with SCD demonstrated increased CBF (50.9 vs 38.8 mL/min/100 g, p < 0.001), increased OEF (0.35 vs 0.25, p < 0.001), increased MD (0.76 vs 0.72 x 10-3 mm2s-1, p = 0.005), and decreased FA (0.40 vs 0.42, p = 0.021) within NAWM compared to controls. In multivariable analysis, increased OEF (beta = 0.19, p = 0.035), but not CBF (beta = 0.00, p = 0.340), independently predicted increased MD in the SCD cohort; neither were predictors in controls. On voxel-wise regression, the SCD cohort demonstrated widespread OEF elevation, encompassing deep white matter regions of elevated MD and reduced FA, which spatially extended beyond high-density infarct locations from the SCD cohort. CONCLUSION: Elevated OEF, a putative index of cerebral oxygen metabolic stress, may provide a metric of ischemic vulnerability that could enable individualization of therapeutic strategies in SCD. The patient- and tissue-based relationships between elevated OEF, elevated MD, and cerebral infarcts suggest that oxygen metabolic stress may underlie microstructural injury prior to the development of cerebral infarcts in SCD.
36040484		Normalization of cerebral hemodynamics after hematopoietic stem cell transplant in children with sickle cell disease.Children with sickle cell disease (SCD) demonstrate cerebral hemodynamic stress and are at high risk of strokes. We hypothesized that curative hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) normalizes cerebral hemodynamics in children with SCD compared with pre-transplant baseline. Whole-brain cerebral blood flow (CBF) and oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) were measured by magnetic resonance imaging 1 to 3 months before and 12 to 24 months after HSCT in 10 children with SCD. Three children had prior overt strokes, 5 children had prior silent strokes, and 1 child had abnormal transcranial Doppler ultrasound velocities. CBF and OEF of HSCT recipients were compared with non-SCD control participants and with SCD participants receiving chronic red blood cell transfusion therapy (CRTT) before and after a scheduled transfusion. Seven participants received matched sibling donor HSCT, and 3 participants received 8 out of 8 matched unrelated donor HSCT. All received reduced-intensity preparation and maintained engraftment, free of hemolytic anemia and SCD symptoms. Pre-transplant, CBF (93.5 mL/100 g/min) and OEF (36.8%) were elevated compared with non-SCD control participants, declining significantly 1 to 2 years after HSCT (CBF, 72.7 mL/100 g per minute; P = .004; OEF, 27.0%; P = .002), with post-HSCT CBF and OEF similar to non-SCD control participants. Furthermore, HSCT recipients demonstrated greater reduction in CBF (-19.4 mL/100 g/min) and OEF (-8.1%) after HSCT than children with SCD receiving CRTT after a scheduled transfusion (CBF, -0.9 mL/100 g/min; P = .024; OEF, -3.3%; P = .001). Curative HSCT normalizes whole-brain hemodynamics in children with SCD. This restoration of cerebral oxygen reserve may explain stroke protection after HSCT in this high-risk patient population.
33775851		An extensive review to facilitate understanding of CRISPR technology as a gene editing possibility for enhanced therapeutic applications.CRISPR are the sequences in bacterial and archaeal genome which provide resistance against viral infections. They might be the natural part of bacterial genomes for providing protection against viruses like bacteriophages but science has successfully achieved their use in the benefit of man-kind by using them for the treatment of deadly diseases like cancer, AIDS or genetic disorders like sickle cell disease and Leber congenital amaurosis. CRISPR system is majorly divided into two classes i.e class I and class II, of which the class II CRISPR/Cas9 system performs site specific cleavage of DNA with a guide RNA Cas12 (Cpf1). With the new emerging discoveries it is being found that CRISPR not only works on double stranded DNA but can also be useful to induce any sort of site specific cleavage in RNA too by Cas13 earlier known as C2c2, which is a protein found in CRISPR system and has ability to cure viral infections in plants. CRISPR is being used in the field of gene manipulation and various animals models are available to serve this purpose with short lifespan, rapid reproducibility and lower maintenance cost. Many successful studies and experiments performed using CRISPR, reveals their potency and utility to bring revolution in the areas which were previously believed to be out of scope of science and medicine.
34101983		SNAP: Supportive noninvasive ventilation for acute chest syndrome prevention in children with sickle cell disease.BACKGROUND: Acute chest syndrome (ACS) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among children with sickle cell disease (SCD). Preventing hypoxemia by optimizing lung aeration during sleep remains a challenge. OBJECTIVES: To explore safety, feasibility, and tolerability of noninvasive, bi-level positive airway pressure ventilation (BiPAP) as preventative, supportive care for hospitalized, medically stable children with SCD on a general pediatric inpatient unit. METHODS: Retrospective chart review of patients <=22 years of age with SCD admitted to the general pediatric inpatient unit from February 1, 2017 to March 1, 2020 for whom BiPAP was recommended as supportive care. Hospitalizations were excluded if patients were admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), required BiPAP for respiratory failure, or used BiPAP at home for obstructive sleep apnea. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients had 53 hospitalizations in which BiPAP was recommended. Fifty-two (98%) hospitalizations included acute SCD pain. Indications for BiPAP included prior ACS (94%), chest or back pain (79%), and/or oxygen desaturation (66%). On 17 occasions, patients already had mild to moderate ACS but were stable when BiPAP was recommended. BiPAP was used successfully during 75% of hospitalizations for a median of two nights. There were no adverse effects associated with BiPAP. PICU transfer for respiratory support occurred during three hospitalizations. In 26 hospitalizations of children at risk for ACS who tolerated BiPAP, 23 (88%) did not develop ACS. CONCLUSIONS: BiPAP is safe, feasible, and well tolerated as supportive care for hospitalized children with SCD. Next steps include an intervention trial to further assess the efficacy of BiPAP on ACS prevention.
33938598		Association of alpha-thalassemia and Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase deficiency with transcranial Doppler ultrasonography in Nigerian children with sickle cell anemia.BACKGROUND: Stroke is a devastating complication of sickle cell anemia (SCA) and can be predicted through abnormally high cerebral blood flow velocity using transcranial Doppler Ultrasonography (TCD). The evidence on the role of alpha-thalassemia and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency in the development of stroke in children with SCA is conflicting. Thus, this study investigated the association of alpha-thalassemia and G6PD(A- ) variant with abnormal TCD velocities among Nigerian children with SCA. METHODS: One hundred and forty-one children with SCA were recruited: 72 children presented with normal TCD (defined as the time-averaged mean of the maximum velocity: < 170 cm/s) and 69 children with abnormal TCD (TAMMV >= 200 cm/s). Alpha-thalassemia (the alpha-3.7 globin gene deletion) was determined by multiplex gap-PCR, while G6PD polymorphisms (202G > A and 376A > G) were genotyped using restriction fragment length polymorphism-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The frequency of alpha-thalassemia trait in the children with normal TCD was higher than those with abnormal TCD: 38/72 (52.8%) [alpha-/ alpha alpha: 41.7%, alpha -/ alpha -: 11.1%] versus 21/69 (30.4%) [alpha-/ alpha alpha: 27.5%, alpha -/ alpha -: 2.9%], and the odds of abnormal TCD were reduced in the presence of the alpha-thalassemia trait [Odds Ratio: 0.39, 95% confidence interval: 0.20-0.78, p = 0.007]. However, the frequencies of G6PDA- variant in children with abnormal and normal TCD were similar (11.6% vs. 15.3%, p = 0.522). CONCLUSION: Our study reveals the protective role of alpha-thalassemia against the risk of abnormal TCD in Nigerian children with SCA.
33647341		Characterization of microvascular disease in pediatric sickle cell disease using nailfold capillaroscopy.Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a disorder with repetitive vaso-occlusive crises resulting in microvascular obstruction and tissue ischemia that may lead to multi-organ ischemia and dysfunction. Nailfold videocapillaroscopy (NFC) is an imaging technique utilized in clinical rheumatology to visualize capillaries located near the fingertip. To characterize NFC abnormalities in the setting of pediatric SCD, we performed NFC using a video capillaroscope on 8 digits in 44 stable SCD patients and 65 age matched healthy controls. Mean capillary number was lower (6.4 +- 1.3 vs 7.5 +- 1.8, p = 0.001) in the SCD group compared to controls. The percentage of dilated capillaries was similar (7.1 +- 8.3 vs. 5.9 +- 8.2, p = 0.4). The large majority of capillaries visualized in the SCD and control groups were normal capillary types per the EULAR definition, with a similar percentage of normal, nonspecific capillary morphologies and abnormal types. Regarding normal capillary sub-types, the SCD group and controls exhibited similar percentages of stereotype hairpin shapes, and tortuous or once or twice crossing type capillaries. On multivariate analyses, mean capillary number was independently associated with SCD after adjusting for age, body mass index, systolic blood pressure and gender. In conclusion, pediatric SCD is associated with lower capillary number but similar percentage of dilated capillaries and morphology on NFC. In our SCD cohort, capillary number was unrelated to our available markers of disease severity, including history of sickle crises, previous hospitalization for crises or Hemoglobin F levels.
38331925		Role of hydroxyurea therapy in the prevention of organ damage in sickle cell disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.BACKGROUND: Hydroxyurea is an affordable drug that reduces vaso-occlusive crises and transfusion requirements in sickle cell disease. However, its effectiveness in preventing chronic organ damage is still unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the role of hydroxyurea in preventing organ morbidity. METHOD: We included original articles published in English from 1st January 1990 to 31st January 2023, reporting hydroxyurea therapy and organ damage from PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, and CrossRef databases. A total of 45 studies with 4681 sickle cell disease patients were evaluated for organ damage. RESULTS: Our analysis showed that hydroxyurea intervention significantly lowered transcranial Doppler and tricuspid regurgitant velocity, with a standardized mean difference of - 1.03 (- 1.49; - 0.58); I 2 = 96% and - 1.37 (CI - 2.31, - 0.42); I 2 = 94%, respectively. Moreover, the pooled estimate for albuminuria showed a beneficial effect post-hydroxyurea therapy by reducing the risk of albuminuria by 58% (risk ratio of 0.42 (0.28; 0.63); I 2 = 28%). CONCLUSION: Our study found that a hydroxyurea dose above 20 mg/kg/day with a mean rise in HbF by 18.46% post-hydroxyurea therapy had a beneficial role in reducing transcranial doppler velocity, tricuspid regurgitant velocity, albuminuria, and splenic abnormality.

33955552		Transfusion management of severe anaemia in African children: a consensus algorithm.The phase III Transfusion and Treatment of severe anaemia in African Children Trial (TRACT) found that conservative management of uncomplicated severe anaemia [haemoglobin (Hb) 40-60 g/l] was safe, and that transfusion volume (20 vs. 30 ml/kg whole blood equivalent) for children with severe anaemia (Hb <60 g/l) had strong but opposing effects on mortality, depending on fever status (>37 5 C). In 2020 a stakeholder meeting of paediatric and blood transfusion groups from Africa reviewed the results and additional analyses. Among all 3196 children receiving an initial transfusion there was no evidence that nutritional status, presence of shock, malaria parasite burden or sickle cell disease status influenced outcomes or modified the interaction with fever status on volume required. Fever status at the time of ordering blood was a reliable determinant of volume required for optimal outcome. Elevated heart and respiratory rates normalised irrespective of transfusion volume and without diuretics. By consensus, a transfusion management algorithm was developed, incorporating three additional measurements of Hb post-admission, alongside clinical monitoring. The proposed algorithm should help clinicians safely implement findings from TRACT. Further research should assess its implementation in routine clinical practice.

Affected children have chronic ill health and suffer premature death. Febrile illnesses such as malaria commonly precipitate acute crises in children with SCA. Thus, chemoprophylaxis for malaria is an important preventive strategy, but current regimes are either sub-optimally effective (e.g. monthly sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine, SP) or difficult to adhere to (e.g. daily proguanil). We propose dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) as the agent with the most potential to be used across Africa. METHODS: This will be a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group superiority trial of weekly single-day courses of DP compared to monthly single-day courses of SP in children with SCA. The study will be conducted in eastern (Uganda) and southern (Malawi) Africa using randomisation stratified by body weight and study centre. Participants will be randomised using an allocation of 1:1 to DP or SP. We will investigate the efficacy, safety, acceptability and uptake and cost-effectiveness of malaria chemoprevention with weekly courses of DP vs monthly SP in 548 to 824 children with SCA followed up for 12-18 months. We will also assess toxicity from cumulative DP dosing and the development of resistance. Participant recruitment commenced on 30 April 2021; follow-up is ongoing. DISCUSSION: At the end of this study, findings will be used to inform regional health policy. This manuscript is prepared from protocol version 2.1 dated 1 January 2022. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04844099 . Registered on 08 April 2021.
38429041		The Inequality of Pain Control in Patients With Pain From Sickle Cell Disease: A Case Report.Approximately 100,000 people in the United States are affected by Sickle Cell Disease (SCD). Acute pain and chronic pain are common and are experienced by everyone with SCD. Children and adolescents who had pain from SCD reported daily pain, decreased function, missed school/workdays, and limited participation in recreational and social activities. This case report aims to highlight the lack of diversity, equity, and inclusion of pain control through the lens of a patient with SCD to improve clinical practice.
37939876		Prevention of neurovascular complications in children with Sickle Cell Disease in the real-world setting: What adult medicine physicians should know.Neurovascular complications represent one of the most detrimental manifestations of Sickle Cell Disease (SCD), affecting many patients since infancy. They include overt stroke, silent cerebral infarcts and neurocognitive disorders. In fact, neurodevelopment can be impaired in children resulting in cognitive dysfunction in adults with SCD. This review is meant to resume the most recent guidelines about the prevention of SCD neurovascular complications and to highlight the open challenges in their implementation. Transcranial Doppler, Magnetic Resonance Imaging/Angiography and neurocognitive test are useful screening tools. Chronic transfusion regimen, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and neurocognitive rehabilitation find indications in the context of primary and secondary prevention of neurovascular complications of SCD. However, international guidelines are often difficult to bring into the real world due to the lack of appropriate instruments and trained personnel. Many challenges have still to be faced to guarantee the best possible neurocognitive function to each child affected by SCD.

However, the quantities of plerixafor-mobilized CD34+ cells vary between different SCD patients for unknown reasons. Twenty-three participants with SCD underwent plerixafor mobilization followed by apheresis, processing, and HSC enrichment under a phase 1 safety and efficacy study conducted at 2 institutions. Linear regression or Spearman's correlation test was used to assess the relationships between various hematologic and clinical parameters with total CD34+ cells/kg collected. Median CD34+ cells/kg after 2 or fewer mobilization and apheresis cycles was 4.0 x 106 (range, 1.5-12.0). Similar to what is observed generally, CD34+ yield correlated negatively with age (P < .001) and positively with baseline (P = .003) and preapheresis blood CD34+ cells/microL (P < .001), and baseline white blood cell (P = .01) and platelet counts (P = .03). Uniquely for SCD, CD34+ cell yields correlated positively with the number of days hydroxyurea was held (for up to 5 weeks, P = .01) and negatively with markers of disease severity, including hospitalization frequency within the preceding year (P = .01) and the number of medications taken for chronic pain (P = .002). Unique SCD-specific technical challenges in apheresis were also associated with reduced CD34+ cell collection efficiency and purification. Here, we describe factors that impact plerixafor mobilization success in patients with SCD, confirming known factors as described in other populations in addition to reporting previously unknown disease specific factors in patients with SCD. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT03226691.
37883315		Longer length peripheral catheters in sickle cell treatment: a more efficient and cost-effective care pathway.Patients with sickle cell disease require frequent venous access for red blood cell exchange transfusions to manage their condition. Such frequent access can lead to scar tissue formation, increased pain on insertion, and difficult vascular access for the patients. Previous attempts at achieving successful venous access for patients with difficult venous access has been made with central venous lines, usually femoral lines, which required a large amount of nursing input and resulted in anxiety and pain on insertion for patients. In this article, the author reports on a new pathway with a longer-length peripheral intravenous catheter that reduces the nursing time burden during line insertion, requires less equipment and, crucially, results in a less painful procedure for patients. The increased efficiency of the pathway resulted in a cost saving of $149 per insertion, and patient feedback revealed that the longer-length catheter was preferred over femoral lines.
36508693		Laser therapy for retinopathy in sickle cell disease.BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) includes a group of inherited haemoglobinopathies affecting multiple organs including the eyes. Some people with SCD develop ocular manifestations. Vision-threatening complications are mainly due to proliferative sickle retinopathy, which is characterised by proliferation of new blood vessels. Laser photocoagulation is widely applicable in proliferative retinopathies. It is important to evaluate the efficacy and safety of laser photocoagulation in the treatment of proliferative sickle retinopathy (PSR) to prevent sight-threatening complications. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of various techniques of laser photocoagulation therapy in SCD-related proliferative retinopathy. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. Date of last search: 4 July 2022. We also searched the following resources (26 June 2022): Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Literature Database (LILACS); WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platforms (ICTRP); and ClinicalTrials.gov. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials comparing laser photocoagulation to no treatment in children and adults with SCD. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed eligibility and risk of bias of the included trials; we extracted and analysed data, contacting trial authors for additional information. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE criteria. MAIN RESULTS: We included three trials (414 eyes of 339 children and adults) comparing the efficacy and safety of laser photocoagulation to no therapy in people with PSR. There were 160 males and 179 females ranging in age from 13 to 67 years. The trials used different laser photocoagulation techniques; one single-centre trial employed sectoral scatter laser photocoagulation using an argon laser; a two-centre trial employed feeder vessel coagulation using argon laser in one centre and xenon arc in the second centre; while a third trial employed focal scatter laser photocoagulation using argon laser. The mean follow-up periods were 21 to 32 months in one trial, 42 to 47 months in a second, and 48 months in the third. Two trials had a high risk of allocation bias due to the randomisation method for participants with bilateral disease; the third trial had an unclear risk of selection bias. One trial was at risk of reporting bias. Given the unit of analysis is the eye rather than the individual, we chose to report the data narratively. Using sectoral scatter laser photocoagulation, one trial (174 eyes) reported no difference between groups for complete regression of PSR: 30.2% in the laser group and 22.4% in the control group. The same trial also reported no difference between groups in the development of new PSR: 34.3% of lasered eyes and 41.3% of control eyes (very low-certainty evidence). The two-centre trial using feeder vessel coagulation, only presented data at follow-up for one centre (mean period of nine years) and reported the development of new sea fan in 48.0% in the treated and 45.0% in the control group; no statistical significance (P = 0.64). A third trial reported regression in 55% of the laser group versus 28.6% of controls and progression of PSR in 10.5% of treated versus 25.7% of control eyes. We graded the evidence for these two primary outcomes as very low-certainty evidence. The sectoral scatter laser photocoagulation trial reported visual loss in 3.0% of treated eyes (mean follow-up 47 months) versus 12.0% of controlled eyes (mean follow-up 42 months) (P = 0.019). The feeder vessel coagulation trial reported visual loss in 1.14% of the laser group and 7.5% of the control group (mean follow-up 26 months at one site and 32 months in another) (P = 0.07). The focal scatter laser photocoagulation trial (mean follow-up of four years) reported that 72/73 eyes had the same visual acuity, while visual loss was seen in only one eye from the control group. We graded the certainty of the evidence as very low. The sectoral scatter laser trial detected vitreous haemorrhage in 12.0% of the laser group and 25.3% of control with a mean follow-up of 42 (control) to 47 months (treated) (P <= 0.5). The two-centre feeder vessel coagulation trial observed vitreous haemorrhage in 3.4% treated eyes (mean follow-up 26 months) versus 27.5% control eyes (mean follow-up 32 months); one centre (mean follow-up nine years) reported vitreous haemorrhage in 1/25 eyes (4.0%) in the treatment group and 9/20 eyes (45.0%) in the control group (P = 0.002). The scatter laser photocoagulation trial reported that vitreous haemorrhage was not seen in the treated group compared to 6/35 (17.1%) eyes in the control group and appeared only in the grades B and (PSR) stage III) (P < 0.05). We graded evidence for this outcome as low-certainty. Regarding adverse effects, only one occurrence of retinal tear was reported. All three trials reported on retinal detachment, with no significance across the treatment and control groups (low-certainty evidence). One trial reported on choroidal neovascularization, with treatment with xenon arc found to be associated with a significantly higher risk, but visual loss related to this complication is uncommon with long-term follow-up of three years or more. The included trials did not report on other adverse effects or quality of life. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Our conclusions are based on the data from three trials (two of which were conducted over 30 years ago). Given the limited evidence available, which we assessed to be of low- or very low-certainty, we are uncertain whether laser therapy for sickle cell retinopathy improves the outcomes measured in this review. This treatment does not appear to have an effect on clinical outcomes such as regression of PSR and development of new incidences. No evidence is available assessing efficacy in relation to patient-important outcomes (such as quality of life or the loss of a driving licence).  Further research is needed to examine the safety of laser treatment compared to other interventions such as intravitreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) . Patient-important outcomes as well as cost-effectiveness should be addressed.
37606223		The impact of obstructive sleep apnea in children with sickle cell disease and asthma.INTRODUCTION: Asthma and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are chronic diseases that disproportionately affect children with sickle cell disease (SCD). The literature describes the negative impact that both conditions have on children with SCD separately; however, the effect of OSA on asthmatic children with OSA is less specific. We hypothesized that the presence of OSA in children with SCD and asthma is associated with specific hematologic markers, worse clinical outcomes, and greater healthcare utilization. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated children with both SCD and asthma who underwent polysomnography (PSG). We assessed their demographic information, PSG data, hematologic indices, and healthcare utilization based on the concurrent presence of OSA. RESULTS: Fifty-nine percent of the cohort had OSA with a lower oxygen saturation (SpO2 ) nadir (87% vs. 93%, p < 0.001) and a lower median daytime SpO2 (96.5% vs. 98.5%, p < 0.05); those with OSA were more likely to have the hemoglobin SS genotype (86% vs. 46.5%, p = 0.03). Additionally, those with OSA had a higher mean corpuscular volume (87 vs. 77.2 fL, p = 0.03) and reticulocyte count (10.1% vs. 5.5%, p < 0.01). There was no difference in asthma severity or healthcare utilization between those with OSA and those without OSA. DISCUSSION: Overall, children with SCD and asthma might be at increased risk for developing OSA, and screening for sleep-disordered breathing should be incorporated as part of their routine care.
37271570		Significant haemoglobinopathies: A guideline for screening and diagnosis: A British Society for Haematology Guideline: A British Society for Haematology Guideline.Antenatal screening/testing of pregnant women should be carried out according to the guidelines of the National Health Service (NHS) Sickle Cell and Thalassaemia Screening Programme. Newborn screening and, when necessary, follow-up testing and referral, should be carried out according to the guidelines of the NHS Sickle Cell and Thalassaemia Screening Programme. All babies under 1 year of age arriving in the United Kingdom should be offered screening for sickle cell disease (SCD). Preoperative screening for SCD should be carried out in patients from ethnic groups in which there is a significant prevalence of the condition. Emergency screening with a sickle solubility test must always be followed by definitive analysis. Laboratories performing antenatal screening should utilise methods that are capable of detecting significant variants and are capable of quantitating haemoglobins A2 and F at the cut-off points required by the national antenatal screening programme. The laboratory must ensure a provisional report is available for antenatal patients within three working days from sample receipt.

Currently, three technologies are the most promising: expression of transgenic globin genes via a lentiviral vector, controlled mutation of the beta-globin control cluster by transgenic CRISPR-based ribonucleoprotein, and suppression of BCL11a mRNA by shRNA. In this review, we discuss the mechanism of each technology and how they correct the SCD pathology at the molecular level. We conclude by discussing potential directions future therapy may take.
35590440		A rapid evidence assessment of sickle cell disease educational interventions.AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of educational interventions on the knowledge and attitude of healthcare professionals (HCPs) regarding sickle cell disease (SCD) pain management in the UK. BACKGROUND: Variations and inadequate pain management due toHCPs' lack of knowledge and negative attitude is still an ongoing global concern for SCD patients despite availability of effective treatment and evidence-based guidelines. Several international studies have implemented interventions aimed at improving knowledge, attitude, and pain management. No review on the effectiveness of these interventions was found. Also, no previous intervention done in the UK was found from the thorough search of research databases. However, there are estimated 240,000 genetic carriers with about 12,500-15,000 estimated people living with SCD in the UK. DESIGN: Rapid Evidence Assessment of existing evidence. METHODS: A rapid evidence assessment was conducted between March 2021-January 2022 following the PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Included papers must have an educational intervention about SCD or related symptom management where the learners were HCPs. Excluded papers were those not published in English or before 2010. The following databases were searched: CINAHL, MEDLINE, PubMed America and Europe, Scopus, PsycINFO and Web of Science. Data quality was assessed using the Mixed Methods Assessment Tool (MMAT) and analysed using a narrative approach. RESULTS: Ten studies were included in the final review. Overall, they reported improved outcomes in six main themes: knowledge, attitude, perception, adoption, satisfaction and efficiency. Five studies reported statistically significant improvement in at least one outcome, four studies reported positive improvement, and two studies reported no significant improvement in knowledge and attitude. These heterogeneous studies were implemented once, and all designs were prone to bias; this makes it difficult to state how effective interventions are for SCD. CONCLUSION: Current evidence of positive improvement in HCPs' knowledge and attitude is insufficient for generalisation and recommendation for adoption. However, we believe that implementing validated educational interventions remains essential for effective acute SCD pain management and patient-centred care. Further research is needed to find a suitable educational intervention that can be replicated. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Quality SCD education, timely crisis management and reduced patient stigma are crucial in reducing the risk of rapid clinical decompensation to avoid developing life-threatening complications. Understanding SCD can also support the building of therapeutic relationships between the patient and practitioner. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This review was not registered.
36036388		Feasibility of population-based screening of sickle cell disease through the primary health care system in tribal areas of India.OBJECTIVE: To describe the development and implementation of a population-based screening programme for sickle cell disease (SCD) implemented in 12 SCD-endemic and tribal-dominated primary/community health centres (PHCs/CHCs) across six districts of India. SETTING: India reports a huge burden of SCD, especially among indigenous (tribal) communities. However, there is no state-led SCD programme in many places, and systematic screening is absent. This situation necessitates developing a model of population screening. METHODS: This programme was meant to screen all people and was carried out in three tiers. The first tier was a symptomatic survey carried out by community health workers. Regular health workers then screened those referred by sickle cell solubility test at sub-health centres as the second tier. The third tier was confirmation by haemoglobin electrophoresis at PHCs/CHCs. Communities were mobilised and prepared to accept the screening. Capacity building of health facilities was ensured through training and supply of equipment and material. RESULTS: Initial observation based on six months' data revealed that out of the 110,754 tribal population of 12 PHCs/CHCs, 8418 (7.6%) were identified in the symptomatic survey. Subsequently, 9416 people, including the above 8418, underwent the solubility test, and 2607 (27.7%) were found to be positive. Of these, 1978 (78.9%) underwent electrophoresis. About 64.2% were found to be positive for sickle haemoglobin (233 (18.4%) SCD and 1036 (81.6%) SCD trait). CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates the feasibility of establishing a population-based screening programme in the primary health care system. It is easy to implement in tribal habitations as part of the proposed national SCD/haemoglobinopathies programme.

Opioids have been the gold standard for VOC treatment without significant improvement pain outcomes. To aid analgesia and combat opioid related adverse effects (ORAEs), some SCD clinicians have trialed infusions of sub-anesthetic ketamine along with opioids to treat VOCs. In this retrospective analysis, we compared adult SCD patients who received early vs late adjunctive sub-anesthetic ketamine infusions for VOCs. METHODS: We identified adult SCD patients (age 18-50 years) who presented to Duke University with a VOC and received sub-anesthetic ketamine infusions from July 2015 to June 2019. We assessed both daily opioid consumption (measured as oral morphine milligram equivalents (MME)) and self-reported 0-10 numeric pain ratings (NPR) at 1, 2, and 3 days after infusion initiation, as well as 1 day after discontinuation. RESULTS: A total of 56 patients were identified with a median age of 30 years. Compared to late administration, early infusion of sub-anesthetic ketamine was associated with a 24.5% (P = .0003) and 25.9% (P = .0006) reduction, respectively, in median NPR at 1 day and 2 days after infusion initiation but did not persist at 3 days following initiation of the infusion. A statistically significant reduction in MME was not observed. CONCLUSIONS: In a nonrandomized study of sickle cell patients with VOCs, early sub-anesthetic ketamine infusion led to greater reduction in subjective pain intensity than late initiation of the infusion. Randomized studies should further explore whether early vs late ketamine infusion improves management of acute SCD pain.
35721605	cause|@CHEMICAL_Creatinine|@DISEASE_Kidney_Diseases	Hyperkalemia and Metabolic Acidosis Occur at a Higher eGFR in Sickle Cell Disease.Background: People with sickle cell disease (SCD) have an elevated estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) compared with the general population, and this may alter the usual creatinine-based eGFR cutoffs for which physiologic evidence of kidney dysfunction is apparent. This study aimed to identify eGFR thresholds for hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis in patients with SCD. Methods: This was a cross-sectional analysis of 733 patients with severe (hemoglobin SS or Sbeta0-thalassemia) SCD genotype, 238 patients with moderate (hemoglobin SC or Sbeta+-thalassemia) SCD genotype, and 1333 age- and sex-matched African Americans from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The prevalence rates of hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis were compared by eGFR category. Cutoffs for hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis were determined using generalized additive models. Results: Hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis were more common in those with severe SCD genotype (13% and 21%, respectively) compared with the NHANES (0.3% and 5%, respectively); the prevalence rates in the moderate SCD genotype were intermediate for hyperkalemia (3%) and metabolic acidosis (11%). The proportion of patients with hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis progressively increased with lower eGFR category in both SCD genotype groups. The eGFR thresholds for hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis were higher in the severe (85 and 91 ml/min per 1.73 m2, respectively) and moderate (52 and 102 ml/min per 1.73 m2, respectively) SCD genotypes compared with the NHANES (34 and 46 ml/min per 1.73 m2). Conclusions: We demonstrate that hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis are more common and occur at higher eGFR values in patients with SCD compared with age- and sex-matched African Americans, including in eGFR ranges considered to be normal. Future studies using redefined creatinine-based eGFR thresholds for abnormal kidney function may identify high-risk patients for earlier intervention strategies and referral for specialized renal care in SCD.
34232977		Introduction to a review series on gene therapy and gene editing for sickle cell disease and hemophilia.
35244209		Autoimmune disease and sickle cell anaemia: 'Intersecting pathways and differential diagnosis'.Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited disorder, which occurs due to a single gene mutation. It has multisystemic manifestations, affecting millions of people worldwide. The effect of SCD on joints and musculature can overlap with clinical features of autoimmune disease (AD). It is therefore difficult for clinical haematologists and physicians treating SCD patients to discriminate between these two conditions clinically. A delay in diagnosis leads to untreated symptoms and treatment differs considerably. An accurate knowledge of clinical findings and laboratory results of AD and SCD can help physicians avoid this. In the review that follows, we examine the existing literature on SCD and AD, and describe the features that may distinguish SCD and autoimmune disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. We aim to guide clinical haematologists and physicians towards a more rapid diagnosis of AD in sickle cell anaemia patients, by correct interpretation of the clinical assessment and commonly available diagnostics.
34474658		Co-existing sickle cell anaemia and inflammatory bowel disease: case report and review of the literature.Sickle cell anaemia (SCA) is a chronic haemolytic anaemia associated with vaso-occlusive painful crises which may affect several systems including the gastro-intestinal system, resulting in abdominal pain. The concurrence of inflammatory bowel disease and haemoglobinopathy is rare. No previously reported concurrent cases of both SCA and ulcerative colitis (UC) in sub-Saharan Africa were found in the literature. A 16-year-old girl with concurrent SCA and UC is presented. She was admitted to University College Hospital, Ibadan with a 1-year history of recurrent peri-umbilical pain and bloody stools. These symptoms were mainly attributed to SCA at the referring hospital, and she was managed for chronic tropical diarrhoea without a remarkable clinical response. This case illustrates the concurrent presentation of SCA and ulcerative colitis which led to the missed and delayed diagnosis of ulcerative colitis.

34537158		Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine Special Statement: Beyond the scalpel: in utero fetal gene therapy and curative medicine.With the recent advances in gene editing with systems such as CRISPR-Cas9, precise genome editing in utero is on the horizon. Sickle cell disease is an excellent candidate for in utero fetal gene therapy, because the disease is monogenic, causes irreversible harm, and has life-limiting morbidity. Gene therapy has recently been proven to be effective in an adolescent patient. Several hurdles still impede the progress for fetal gene therapy in humans, including an incomplete understanding of the fetal immune system, unclear maternal immune responses to in utero gene therapy, risks of off-target effects from gene editing, gestational age constraints, and ethical questions surrounding fetal genetic intervention. However, none of these barriers appears insurmountable, and the journey to in utero gene therapy for sickle cell disease and other conditions should be well underway.
37743224		Effects of prophylactic red blood cell (RBC) transfusion with extended antigen matching on alloimmunization in patients with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD).BACKGROUND: RBC alloimmunization remains a significant problem for many patients with SCD. To reduce alloimmunization some strategies have been implemented to provide limited or extended antigen matched RBC transfusions to patients with SCD who need chronic transfusion support. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of prophylactic RBC transfusion with extended antigen matching on alloimmunization in patients with SCD. METHODS: This is a 20-year retrospective study of patients with SCD transfused with RBCS that were prospectively matched for D, C, c, E, e, K, Fya/Fyb, Jka/Jkb and S antigens. Our study included 95 patients, and none had antibodies documented before their first transfusion. Patients and donors were phenotyped and molecular typing was performed in all patients who had recent transfusions or a positive direct antiglobulin test to predict their antigen profile. Unexpected antibodies to the Rh system, meaning anti-Rh antibodies in patients whose serologic phenotype was Rh positive, were investigated by molecular genotyping for RH variant alleles. RESULTS: During this study-period, 12 (12.6%) were alloimmunized and 83 (87.4%) were not. Among the 12 patients who alloimmunized, 7 (58.3%) developed antibodies to Rh antigens and 5 (41.7%) produced antibodies to low prevalence antigens. All patients who developed Rh antibodies had RH variant alleles. Autoantibodies were found in 16 (16.8%) transfused patients. CONCLUSION: SCD patients benefit from receiving prophylactic RBC transfusions with extended antigen matching, as demonstrated by the reduction on the rates of alloimmunization and the lack of antibodies to K, FY, JK and S antigens, however, this strategy does not avoid alloimmunization to Rh and low-prevalence antigens.
35345916		Retinal atrophy and markers of systemic and cerebrovascular severity in homozygous sickle cell disease.INTRODUCTION: While paramacular retinal atrophy (PRA) is known to be found in 48% of eyes of adults and 42% of eyes of children with homozygous SCD (SS-SCD), the aim of this study is to assess the association between PRA and red blood cell (RBC) deformability, hematological markers and brain imaging abnormalities in SS-SCD. METHODS: This study is a subset of DREAM2, a prospective observational study performed between August 2015 and August 2016. Children (5-17 years) with SS-SCD and no history of large vessel vasculopathy, were included. Ophthalmological characteristics including visual acuity, fundus examination, OCT of central and temporal retina (with several retinal thickness measurements) were explored in relation with RBC deformability (ektacytometry), hematological and biochemical (hemolysis parameters), and neurological (cerebral oxygenation estimated by Near Infrared Spectroscopy, brain magnetic resonance imaging) investigations. RESULTS: 17 children (5 boys; mean age: 13 years) with complete ophthalmological investigations were included in the analysis; 8 exhibited PRA. RBC deformability was found to be significantly lower in children with PRA for measurements made at 1.69 Pa (0.16 a.u +- 0.02 vs 0.21 a.u +- 0.03, p = 0.02) and above, as well as cerebral oxygenation (59.25% +- 9.9 vs 71.53% +- 4.9, p = 0.02). A significant positive correlation was found between temporal retinal thickness and hemoglobin level (rho = 0.65, p = 0.007), hematocrit (rho = 0.53, p = 0.04) and RBC deformability at 3 Pa (rho = 0.75, p = 0.005) and above. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that PRA could be an early marker of systemic severity and cerebral oxygenation in SCD. Whether it could help predicting cerebral vasculopathy requires further investigations.
37074146		Epidemiological and clinical features, therapeutic strategies and outcomes in patients with hyperhaemolysis: A systematic review.Hyperhaemolysis syndrome (HHS), a severe form of delayed haemolytic transfusion reaction most commonly described in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), involves destruction of both donor and recipient red blood cells (RBCs). As the epidemiology and underlying pathophysiology have yet to be definitively elucidated, recognition can be challenging. We systematically reviewed PubMed and EMBASE to identify all cases of post-transfusion hyperhaemolysis and characterized the epidemiological, clinical and immunohaematological characteristics and treatments of HHS. We identified 51 patients (33 females and 18 males), including 31 patients with SCD (HbSS, HbSC and HbS/beta-thalassaemia). The median haemoglobin nadir (3.9 g/dL) occurred a median of 10 days post-transfusion. 32.6% and 45.7% of patients had a negative indirect anti-globulin test and a negative direct anti-globulin test, respectively. The most common therapies included corticosteroids and intravenous immune globulin. 66.0% of patients received >=1 supportive transfusion, which was associated with a longer median hospital stay/time to recovery (23 days vs. 15 days; p = 0.015) compared to no supportive transfusion. These findings illustrate that HHS that often results in marked anaemia 10 days post-transfusion is not restricted to patients with haemoglobinopathies, and additional transfused RBCs may be associated with a longer time-to-recovery.
37277324		A multimodal pain protocol for treatment of vaso-occlusive crisis in patients with sickle cell disease: Implementation and evaluation.OBJECTIVES: Pain management during a vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) remains a major challenge and strongly depends on opioids. We developed a multimodality pain protocol for rapid, opioid-sparing pain treatment of VOC and evaluated its feasibility. METHODS: Patients were included for evaluation if they were >=18 years, diagnosed with SCD and visited the emergency department (ED) because of VOC between July 2018 and December 2020. Primary evaluation outcome was the feasibility of multimodal pain analgesia (i.e., the use of at least two analgesics with different underlying mechanisms of action). RESULTS: A total of 131 SCD patients visited the ED because of VOC with a total of 550 ED presentations, of which 377 were eventually hospitalised. A total of 508 (92.4%) ED presentations and 374 (99.2%) hospital admissions received multimodal pain treatment. Time to first administration of an opioid was median [IQR] 34.0 [21.0-62.0] minutes. CONCLUSION: The implementation of a pain protocol using multimodal analgesia for VOC in patients with SCD appeared to be feasible and facilitated rapid administration of opioids. Controlled trials are needed to investigate the effectiveness of multimodal analgesia on pain and should focus on patient reported outcome measures.

34535466		Risk prediction of covid-19 related death and hospital admission in adults after covid-19 vaccination: national prospective cohort study.OBJECTIVES: To derive and validate risk prediction algorithms to estimate the risk of covid-19 related mortality and hospital admission in UK adults after one or two doses of covid-19 vaccination. DESIGN: Prospective, population based cohort study using the QResearch database linked to data on covid-19 vaccination, SARS-CoV-2 results, hospital admissions, systemic anticancer treatment, radiotherapy, and the national death and cancer registries. SETTINGS: Adults aged 19-100 years with one or two doses of covid-19 vaccination between 8 December 2020 and 15 June 2021. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was covid-19 related death. Secondary outcome was covid-19 related hospital admission. Outcomes were assessed from 14 days after each vaccination dose. Models were fitted in the derivation cohort to derive risk equations using a range of predictor variables. Performance was evaluated in a separate validation cohort of general practices. RESULTS: Of 6 952 440 vaccinated patients in the derivation cohort, 5 150 310 (74.1%) had two vaccine doses. Of 2031 covid-19 deaths and 1929 covid-19 hospital admissions, 81 deaths (4.0%) and 71 admissions (3.7%) occurred 14 days or more after the second vaccine dose. The risk algorithms included age, sex, ethnic origin, deprivation, body mass index, a range of comorbidities, and SARS-CoV-2 infection rate. Incidence of covid-19 mortality increased with age and deprivation, male sex, and Indian and Pakistani ethnic origin. Cause specific hazard ratios were highest for patients with Down's syndrome (12.7-fold increase), kidney transplantation (8.1-fold), sickle cell disease (7.7-fold), care home residency (4.1-fold), chemotherapy (4.3-fold), HIV/AIDS (3.3-fold), liver cirrhosis (3.0-fold), neurological conditions (2.6-fold), recent bone marrow transplantation or a solid organ transplantation ever (2.5-fold), dementia (2.2-fold), and Parkinson's disease (2.2-fold). Other conditions with increased risk (ranging from 1.2-fold to 2.0-fold increases) included chronic kidney disease, blood cancer, epilepsy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary heart disease, stroke, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, thromboembolism, peripheral vascular disease, and type 2 diabetes. A similar pattern of associations was seen for covid-19 related hospital admissions. No evidence indicated that associations differed after the second dose, although absolute risks were reduced. The risk algorithm explained 74.1% (95% confidence interval 71.1% to 77.0%) of the variation in time to covid-19 death in the validation cohort. Discrimination was high, with a D statistic of 3.46 (95% confidence interval 3.19 to 3.73) and C statistic of 92.5. Performance was similar after each vaccine dose. In the top 5% of patients with the highest predicted covid-19 mortality risk, sensitivity for identifying covid-19 deaths within 70 days was 78.7%. CONCLUSION: This population based risk algorithm performed well showing high levels of discrimination for identifying those patients at highest risk of covid-19 related death and hospital admission after vaccination.

34633508		Strenuous exercise in warm environment is associated with improved microvascular function in sickle cell trait.PURPOSE: Sickle cell trait is characterized by the presence of both normal and abnormal haemoglobin in red blood cells. The rate of exertional collapse is increased in athletes and military recruits who carry the trait, particularly in stressful environmental conditions. The aim of the present study was to investigate microvascular function and its determinants in response to intense exercise at control and warm environmental temperatures in carriers (AS) and non-carriers (AA) of sickle cell trait. METHODS: Nine AS and 11 AA, all healthy physically active young men, randomly participated in four experimental sessions (rest at 21  C and 31  C and cycling at 21  C and 31  C). All participants performed three exercises bouts as follows: 18-min submaximal exercise; an incremental test to exhaustion; and three 30-s sprints spaced with 20-s resting intervals. RESULTS: Skin Blood Flow (SkBF) was similar at rest between AA and AS. SkBF for all participants was higher at 31  C than 21  C. It was significantly higher in the AS group compared to the AA group immediately after exercise, regardless of the environmental conditions. No significant differences in hemorheological parameters, muscle damage or cardiac injury biomarkers were observed between the two groups. Our data also suggest higher oxidative stress for the AS group, with high superoxide dismutase (P = 0.044 main group effect). CONCLUSION: A specific profile is identified in the AS population, with increased microvascular reactivity after maximal exercise in stressful environment and slight pro-/antioxidant imbalance.
36775201		Multicenter Long-Term Follow-Up of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation with Omidubicel: A Pooled Analysis of Five Prospective Clinical Trials.Omidubicel is an umbilical cord blood (UCB)-derived ex vivo-expanded cellular therapy product that has demonstrated faster engraftment and fewer infections compared with unmanipulated UCB in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. Although the early benefits of omidubicel have been established, long-term outcomes remain unknown. We report on a planned pooled analysis of 5 multicenter clinical trials including 105 patients with hematologic malignancies or sickle cell hemoglobinopathy who underwent omidubicel transplantation at 26 academic transplantation centers worldwide. With a median follow-up of 22 months (range, .3 to 122 months), the 3-year estimated overall survival and disease-free survival were 62.5% and 54.0%, respectively. With up to 10 years of follow-up, omidubicel showed durable trilineage hematopoiesis. Serial quantitative assessments of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD19+, CD116+CD56+, and CD123+ immune subsets revealed median counts remaining within normal ranges through up to 8 years of follow-up. Secondary graft failure occurred in 5 patients (5%) in the first year, with no late cases reported. One case of donor-derived myeloid neoplasm was reported at 40 months post-transplantation. This was also observed in a control arm patient who received only unmanipulated UCB. Overall, omidubicel demonstrated stable trilineage hematopoiesis, immune competence, and graft durability in extended follow-up.
37917573		Painless Orbital Bone Infarction in a Child with Sickle Cell Anemia: A Case of Misdiagnosed Periorbital Cellulitis.BACKGROUND Sickle cell orbitopathy is a rare complication of sickle cell disease that closely mimics other conditions, such as orbital cellulitis and osteomyelitis. We report a case of painless orbital bone infarction masquerading as periorbital cellulitis in a child with sickle cell anemia. CASE REPORT A 4-year-old Saudi girl with sickle cell disease presented to our hospital with vaso-occlusive crisis characterized by bilateral lower limb pain and painless left orbital swelling. On examination, she had swelling of the left upper eyelid with redness and mild ptosis (margin reflex distance 1 was 2 mm) without proptosis. Magnetic resonance imaging with contrast showed bilateral sub-periosteal heterogeneous collections (2x0.8x2.1 cm in the superolateral wall of the left orbit and 1x0.6 cm in the inferolateral wall of the right orbit), with intermediate-to-high T1 signal intensity and high T2 signal, causing a mass effect on the adjacent superior and lateral rectus muscles. The patient was treated with systemic antibiotics and supportive treatment for vaso-occlusive crisis under the care of the pediatric team and was discharged without complications. CONCLUSIONS The diagnosis of sickle cell orbitopathy can be challenging, and an accurate diagnosis is essential to ensure appropriate management. Thus, we report the case of a 4-year-old child with painless sickle cell orbitopathy masquerading as pre-septal cellulitis.
36226857	treat|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell	Evaluation of pharmacological efficacy and safety of hydroxyurea in sickle cell disease: Study of a pediatric cohort from Chhattisgarh, India.Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a disease of abnormal hemoglobin associated with severe clinical phenotype and recurrent complications. Hydroxyurea (HU) is one of the US-FDA approved and commonly used drug for the treatment of adult SCD patients with clinical -severity. However, its use in the pediatric groups remains atypical. Despite a high prevalence of the disease in the state Chhattisgarh, there is a lack of evidence supporting its use in pediatric patients. This study aimed to evaluate the pharmacological and clinical efficacy and safety of HU in a large pediatric cohort with SCD from Central India. The study cohort consisted of 164 SCD (138 Hb SS and 26 Hb S beta-thalassemia) children (<=14 years of age) on HU therapy, who were monitored for toxicity, hematological and clinical efficacy at baseline (Pre-HU) and after 24 months (Post-HU). The results highlight the beneficial effects of HU at a mean dose of 18.7 +- 7.0 mg/kg/day. A significant improvement was observed, not only in physical and clinical parameters but also in hematological parameters which include fetal hemoglobin (Hb F), total hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) levels, when evaluated against the baseline. We did not observe any significant adverse effects during the treatment period. Similar results were obtained on independent analysis of Hb SS and Hb Sbeta patients. These findings strengthen the beneficial effect of hydroxyurea in pediatric population also without any serious adverse effects and builds up ground for expanding its use under regular monitoring.
35821343	associate|@CHEMICAL_Bilirubin|@DISEASE_Glycosuria_Renal	Frequency, pattern, and associations of renal iron accumulation in sickle/beta-thalassemia patients.We evaluated frequency, pattern, and associations of renal iron accumulation in sickle/beta-thalassemia. Thirty-three sickle/beta-thalassemia patients (36.5 +- 14.7 years; 13 females), 14 homozygous sickle cell disease (SCD) patients, and 71 thalassemia major (TM) patients, enrolled in the E-MIOT Network, underwent magnetic resonance imaging. Iron overload (IO) was quantified by the T2* technique. Sickle/beta-thalassemia patients had a significantly lower frequency of renal IO (T2* < 31 ms) than homozygous SCD patients (9.1% vs. 57.1%; P = 0.001), besides having similar hepatic, cardiac and pancreatic IO. Kidney T2* values were comparable between regularly transfused sickle/beta-thalassemia and TM patients but were significantly lower in regularly transfused homozygous SCD patients than in the other two groups. In sickle/beta-thalassemia patients, global renal T2* values were not associated with age, gender, splenectomy, and presence of regular transfusions or chelation. No correlation was detected between renal T2* values and serum ferritin levels or iron load in the other organs. Global renal T2* values were not associated with serum creatinine levels but showed a significant inverse correlation with serum lactate dehydrogenase (R =  - 0.709; P < 0.0001) and indirect bilirubin (R =  - 0.462; P = 0.012). Renal IO is not common in sickle/beta-thalassemia patients, with a prevalence significantly lower compared to that of homozygous SCD patients, but with a similar underlying mechanism due to the chronic hemolysis.
37002797	associate|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell|@GENE_RHD	Variant RHD alleles and Rh immunization in patients with sickle cell disease.RH diversity among patients and donors contributes to Rh immunization despite serologic Rh-matched red cell transfusions. Anti-D can occur in D+ patients with RHD variants that encode partial D antigens. Anti-D has also been reported in patients with conventional RHD transfused primarily with units from Black donors who frequently have variant RHD. We report 48 anti-D in 690 D+ transfused individuals with sickle cell disease, categorized here as expressing conventional D, partial D or D antigen encoded by RHD*DAU0. Anti-D formed in a greater proportion of individuals with partial D, occurred after fewer D+ unit exposures, and remained detectable for longer than for those in the other categories. Among all anti-D, 13 had clinical or laboratory evidence of poor transfused red cell survival. Most individuals with anti-D were chronically transfused, including 32 with conventional RHD who required an average of 62 D- units/year following anti-D. Our findings suggest that patients with partial D may benefit from prophylactic D- or RH genotype-matched transfusions to prevent anti-D. Future studies should investigate whether RH genotype-matched transfusions can improve use of valuable donations from Black donors, reduce D immunization and minimize transfusion of D- units to D+ individuals with conventional RHD or DAU0 alleles.
36031725		Neurocognitive functioning in children with sickle cell anemia and history of abnormal transcranial doppler ultrasonography.BACKGROUND: Transcranial doppler (TCD) ultrasonography can be used to identify stroke risk in children with sickle cell anemia. Previous studies have reported mixed findings on neurocognitive outcomes in children with elevated TCD. This study examined associations between TCD velocity and neurocognitive outcomes in children and adolescents without prior history of stroke. PROCEDURE: Participants were selected from the Sickle Cell Clinical Research Intervention Program cohort. The highest recorded mean maximum TCD velocity was selected for analysis, along with participant's most recent data from serial neurocognitive surveillance. RESULTS: A total of 200 children with sickle cell anemia completed neurocognitive testing (109 males, 91 females; mean age 12.7 years [SD = 3.56]). Most participants were prescribed hydroxyurea (72%) at the time of neurocognitive testing and nearly 16% had a history of chronic transfusions prior to neurocognitive evaluation. Mean age at time of highest TCD value was 6.6 years (SD = 2.5) and 13.5% of screenings were abnormal (>=200 cm/s). Mean interval between TCD and most recent neurocognitive evaluation was 6.1 years (+-3.5). There were no significant differences in the interval between TCD and neurocognitive testing across normal, conditional, and abnormal groups. Maximum TCD velocity was not significantly associated with neurocognitive outcomes in multivariate models. CONCLUSIONS: History of elevated TCD in the absence of overt stroke should not be considered a risk factor for poor neurocognitive outcomes in children and adolescents with sickle cell anemia on modern disease-modifying therapy.
34889404		Management of hemolytic transfusion reactions.Delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions (DHTRs) in patients with sickle cell disease are underappreciated and potentially fatal. Patients with DHTRs typically have symptoms of pain or dark urine days to weeks following a red blood cell (RBC) transfusion. In instances of DHTRs with hyperhemolysis, the patient's hemoglobin (Hgb) may be significantly lower than it was pretransfusion, and the Hgb A may drop by more than 50%. In most cases, at least 1 RBC alloantibody and sometimes multiple RBC alloantibodies can be identified during the DHTR, with those antibodies presumably having fallen below the level of detection at the time of the implicated transfusion. However, in up to one-third of cases, no new RBC alloantibodies can be identified posttransfusion. Complement is increasingly being appreciated to play a role in DHTRs and hyperhemolysis, not only due to classic pathway activation (with complement fixed antibody bound to RBCs) but also due to alternative pathway activation (resulting in part from plasma free heme). As such, anti-C5 inhibition has recently been reported to be effective at mitigating hemolysis in the setting of some severe DHTRs. Transfusion avoidance during DHTRs is recommended if possible, with long-term transfusion support advice being less clear; for example, a history of a severe DHTR may lead to questions regarding the safety of transfusions prior to curative therapies such as stem cell transplantation or gene therapy. A better understanding of antibody-positive and antibody-negative DHTRs, including patient- or disease-specific risk factors, is necessary to improve transfusion safety.

Fetal hemoglobin interferes with polymerization but is epigenetically silenced by DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) in adult erythropoiesis. Decitabine depletes DNMT1 and increases fetal and total hemoglobin in SCD patients, but is rapidly catabolized by cytidine deaminase (CDA) in vivo. Tetrahydrouridine (THU) inhibits CDA, safeguarding decitabine. METHODS: The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of three oral combination formulations of THU and decitabine, with different coatings producing different delays in decitabine release, were investigated in healthy participants. RESULTS: Tetrahydrouridine and decitabine were rapidly absorbed into the systemic circulation after a single combination oral dose, with relative bioavailability of decitabine >=74% in fasted males compared with separate oral administration of THU followed by decitabine 1 h later. THU and decitabine Cmax and area under the plasma concentration versus time curve were higher in females versus males, and fasted versus fed states. Despite sex and food effect on pharmacokinetics, the pharmacodynamic effect of DNMT1 downregulation was comparable in males and females and fasted and fed states. Treatments were well tolerated. CONCLUSION: Combination oral formulations of THU with decitabine produced pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics suitable for oral DNMT1-targeted therapy.
37637401		Newborn screening for sickle cell disease in Butembo and Beni: a pilot experience in a highland region of the Democratic Republic of Congo.Introduction: sickle cell disease is an inherited autosomal recessive hemoglobin disorder resulting in acute and chronic systemic complications. Despite the high burden of sickle cell disease in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, limited data on disease prevalence is available and systematic screening is not offered to newborns. This study aimed to provide neonatal prevalence and associated factors to the phenotypic manifestation of sickle cell disease in an eastern region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Methods: the study was conducted from 20th April 2021 to 20th January 2022 in the cities of Beni and Butembo, involving live full-term newborns whose parents consented to participate. Blood was taken with heel pricks and analyzed using the point-of-care diagnostic tool HemoTypeSC . We used Fisher s exact test to compare frequencies between groups. P-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: of the 1195 newborns screened, 1122 (93.9%) were tested as having hemoglobin AA, 71 (5.9%) hemoglobin AS, 2 (0.2%) hemoglobin SS and none hemoglobin C. The mother s ethnicity was significantly associated with the phenotypic expression of sickle cell disease. Conclusion: sickle cell disease prevalence is lower in Butembo and Beni than in other regions of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. However, it remains an alarming public health issue. Systematic newborn screening, parent/patient education and early management programs constitute an urgent need to be addressed by decision-makers.
35441211		Parents' Experiences and Needs Regarding Infant Sickle Cell Trait Results.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Sickle cell trait (SCT) has reproductive implications and can rarely cause health problems. SCT counseling improves parent knowledge but is infrequently received by children with SCT compared with children with cystic fibrosis carrier status. There are no national guidelines on SCT disclosure timing, frequency, or counseling content. Parents' experiences with SCT disclosure and counseling are poorly understood but could inform the development of guidelines. We explored parents' experiences with and desires for SCT disclosure and counseling for their infants with SCT identified via newborn screening. METHODS: Parents of infants 2 to 12 months old with SCT were recruited through a state newborn screening program for semistructured interviews to explore their experiences with and desires for SCT disclosure and counseling. Inductive thematic analysis was conducted. RESULTS: Sixteen interviews were completed from January to August 2020. Most parents reported that SCT disclosure occurred soon after birth, in person, and by the child's physician. Five themes were identified: parent knowledge before child's SCT disclosure, family planning, the dynamics of SCT disclosure and counseling, emotions and actions after SCT disclosure, and parent desires for the SCT disclosure and counseling process. Two primary parent desires were revealed. Parents want more information about SCT, particularly rare symptomatology, and they want SCT counseling repeated once the child approaches adolescence. CONCLUSION: Parents report receiving their child's SCT diagnosis in the early newborn period from their child's doctor but indicate they receive incomplete information. Opportunities exist in primary care pediatrics to better align SCT disclosure timing and counseling content with parent desires.

As understanding of the disease pathophysiology increases, progress is being made in developing drug therapies. Hydroxyurea, l-glutamine, crizanlizumab, and voxelotor are currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, with multiple others at various stages of testing. With the limited efficacy of individual agents, combinations of agents will likely be required for optimal outcomes. Clinical and surrogate endpoints, other than vaso-occlusive crisis, are increasingly being considered in the evaluation of novel drugs.

This study aimed to assess cognitive impairment and identify possible risk factors in patients with sickle cell disease in Egypt. This study was conducted at Cairo University Children Hospital. Patients with sickle cell disease, between ages of 6-20 years were enrolled. Cognitive ability was tested using the Stanford Binet intelligence quotient (IQ) test, fourth edition. Transcranial Doppler, magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography of the brain were performed within a week of the IQ test. Among the 40 enrolled patients, 55% had a Full Scale IQ at least 1 standard deviation below the mean, and 27.5% had an IQ 2 standard deviations below the mean. High lactate dehydrogenase was significantly associated with low IQ (p = 0.004). In univariate analyses, IQ was significantly correlated with older age (p = 0.025), high lactate dehydrogenase (p = 0.008) and older age at the start of hydroxyurea (p = 0.025). Impaired cognition is prevalent among sickle cell disease patients. Early initiation of hydroxyurea therapy, which should also reduce hemolysis and lactate dehydrogenase, may be a simple measure to preserve mental abilities in these patients.

Successful compensation depends on an increase in oxygen supply such as that provided by an increase in cerebral blood flow (CBF). We used magnetic resonance imaging to provide a high-resolution assessment of the ability of SCD patients to respond to a vasoactive stimulus in middle, anterior, and posterior cerebral artery territories for both white and gray matter. Cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) was measured as the blood oxygen level dependent signal (a surrogate for CBF) response to an increase in the end tidal partial pressure of CO2 (PET CO2 ). The dynamic aspect of the response was measured as the time constant of the first order response kinetics (tau). To confirm and support these findings we used an alternative examination of the response, transfer function analysis (TFA), to measure the responsiveness (gain), the speed of response (phase), and the consistency of the response over time (coherence). We tested 34 patients with SCD and compared the results to those of 24 healthy controls participants. The results from a three-way ANOVA showed that patients with SCD have reduced CVR (p < 0.001) and lower coherence (p < 0.001) in gray matter and white matter and reduced gain in gray matter only (p < 0.001). In terms of the speed of the response to CO2 , tau (p < 0.001) and TFA phase (p < 0.001) were increased in SCD patients compared to healthy control subjects. These findings show that the cerebrovascular responsiveness to CO2 in patients with SCD is both decreased and slowed compared to healthy controls.
35503496		A case of autopsy discovery of acute chest syndrome triggered by pulmonary embolism in a sickle cell patient.This is a case report about a 7-year-old male child with sickle cell anemia (S/beta+) who died unexpectedly during hospitalization, justifying the performance of a forensic autopsy completed by histological examination of organ fragments and toxicological analyses of biological fluids. The diagnosis retained was pulmonary thromboembolism as the cause of death occurring in the context of an acute chest syndrome (ACS). The mechanism of occurrence of this pulmonary embolism was vascular stasis caused by sickle cell disease. The search for etiologies of ACS complicating sickle cell disease should not exclude pulmonary embolism with red cell dense fibrin clot..

Due to functional asplenia, a dysfunctional antibody response, antibiotic drug resistance and poor response to immunization, SCD patients have impaired immunity. A leading cause of hospitalization and death in SCD patients is the acute chest syndrome (ACS). This complication is especially manifested upon infection of SCD patients with Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn)-a facultative anaerobic Gram-positive bacterium that causes lower respiratory tract infections. Spn has developed increased rates of antibiotics resistance and is particularly virulent in SCD patients. The primary defense against Spn is the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during the oxidative burst of neutrophils and macrophages. Paradoxically, Spn itself produces high levels of the ROS hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as a virulence strategy. Apart from H2O2, Spn also secretes another virulence factor, i.e., the pore-forming exotoxin pneumolysin (PLY), a potent mediator of lung injury in patients with pneumonia in general and particularly in those with SCD. PLY is released early on in infection either by autolysis or bacterial lysis following the treatment with antibiotics and has a broad range of biological activities. This review will discuss recent findings on the role of pneumococci in ACS pathogenesis and on strategies to counteract the devastating effects of its virulence factors on the lungs in SCD patients.
34488784		Combining malaria vaccination with chemoprevention: a promising new approach to malaria control.Malaria control has stalled in a number of African countries and novel approaches to malaria control are needed for these areas. The encouraging results of a recent trial conducted in young children in Burkina Faso and Mali in which a combination of the RTS,S/AS01E malaria vaccine and seasonal malaria chemoprevention led to a substantial reduction in clinical cases of malaria, severe malaria, and malaria deaths compared with the administration of either intervention given alone suggests that there may be other epidemiological/clinical situations in which a combination of malaria vaccination and chemoprevention could be beneficial. Some of these potential opportunities are considered in this paper. These include combining vaccination with intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in infants, with intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy (through vaccination of women of child-bearing age before or during pregnancy), or with post-discharge malaria chemoprevention in the management of children recently admitted to hospital with severe anaemia. Other potential uses of the combination are prevention of malaria in children at particular risk from the adverse effects of clinical malaria, such as those with sickle cell disease, and during the final stages of a malaria elimination programme when vaccination could be combined with repeated rounds of mass drug administration. The combination of a pre-erythrocytic stage malaria vaccine with an effective chemopreventive regimen could make a valuable contribution to malaria control and elimination in a variety of clinical or epidemiological situations, and the potential of this approach to malaria control needs to be explored.
34078644		Trends in Technology Assistance Among Patients With Childhood Onset Chronic Conditions.OBJECTIVE: To describe the prevalence, types, and trends over time of medical technology assistance (TA) in patients at the age of transition to adult care with childhood onset chronic conditions (COCCs) cared for at children's hospitals. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this retrospective repeated annual cross-sectional cohort study of the Pediatric Health Information Systems inpatient data, patients with at least 1 hospitalization from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2018 with a selected COCC were included. The COCCs investigated were brain and spinal cord malformation, cerebral palsy, heart and great vessel malformation, cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, and chronic renal failure. TA was defined as requiring an indwelling medical device to maintain health status. Trends over time in TA were analyzed with the Cochran-Armitage test and generalized linear models. RESULTS: During the study, 381 289 unique patients accounted for 940 816 hospitalizations. Transition-aged patients (19-21 years old) represented 2.4% of all included hospitalizations over the 11-year period, whereas patients ages 21 and above represented 2.7%. The annual proportion of patients with TA increased significantly from 31.3% in 2008 to 36.9% in 2018, a 17.9% increase (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of patients with select COCCs hospitalized at children's hospitals, a substantial and growing number of patients at the age of transition to adult care required TA. Identifying adult providers with resources to manage COCCs and maintain medical devices placed in childhood is challenging. These trends warrant special attention to support the timely and successful transition of medically complex patients from pediatric to adult care.

However, such data remain limited in the paediatric population. In this cross-sectional study, we enrolled 361 sickle cell disease children from the Democratic Republic of Congo. Participants were genotyped for the beta (beta)-globin gene, apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) risk variants, and haem oxygenase-1 (HMOX1) GT-dinucleotide repeats. As markers of kidney damage, albuminuria, hyperfiltration and decreased estimated glomerular filtration with creatinine (eGFRcr) were measured. An association of independent clinical and genetic factors with these markers of kidney damage were assessed via regression analysis. Genetic sequencing confirmed sickle cell anaemia in 326 participants. Albuminuria, hyperfiltration and decreased eGFRcr were present in 65 (20%), 52 (16%) and 18 (5 5%) patients, respectively. Regression analysis revealed frequent blood transfusions, indirect bilirubin and male gender as clinical predictors of SCN. APOL1 high-risk genotype (G1/G1, G2/G2 and G1/G2) was significantly associated with albuminuria (P = 0 04) and hyperfiltration (P = 0 001). HMOX1 GT-dinucleotide long repeats were significantly associated with lower eGFRcr. The study revealed a high burden of kidney damage among Congolese children and provided evidence of the possible role of APOL1 and HMOX1 in making children more susceptible to kidney complications.
36752670		An outpatient pain plan and ED pain pathway for adults with sickle cell disease.ABSTRACT: Sickle cell disease (SCD), one of the most common inherited diseases, is associated with lifetime morbidity and reduced life expectancy. In the United States, SCD primarily affects Black patients and, to a lesser degree, those of Hispanic descent. These populations are known to have healthcare disparities related to lower socioeconomic status, limited access to healthcare, and racial bias. The quality-adjusted life expectancy of patients with SCD is less than 35 years, because of progressive complications of the disease. The most common complication is severe episodic pain related to vaso-occlusive ischemic events. Despite guidelines, pain management often is delayed as patients struggle with resistance from clinicians based on concerns over opioid use or abuse, overdose, or drug-seeking behavior. Effective pain management can be accomplished with collaboration between clinicians and patients, a documented outpatient pain management plan, and when necessary, an ED clinical pain pathway for acute SCD pain management.

34287597		Contraception and reproductive planning from the perspective of women with sickle cell disease.OBJECTIVE: To understand the perceptions of women with sickle cell disease (SCD) about reproductive planning in a public health service. METHOD: This is a qualitative study conducted with 15 women with SCD attended at a public hospital in Recife, between August 2018 and May 2019. Bardin's content analysis technique was used. RESULTS: The women were between 25 and 38 years old, married, and had low education. After the analysis, four thematic categories emerged: information about contraception, use of contraceptive methods, feelings about pregnancy, and gynecological consultation. It was found that women with SCD are influenced by factors such as fear of complications during pregnancy, lack of information on reproductive planning, partners and health professional opinion, and difficulties in health service access. FINAL CONSIDERATIONS: The reports demonstrate that health workers need to improve the way through which information reaches the patient, to offer a more satisfactory professional practice.

Anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) measures ovarian reserve, and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) defines premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) at values >40 mIU/mL in pubertal females. The present study was conducted to assess ovarian reserve and function before and after transplantation in pediatric and adolescent females with SCD treated with allogeneic HCT between January 2015 and June 2020 at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta. In this retrospective review of 17 females age <21 years with SCD who had AMH levels measured at baseline and at 2 years post-HCT, AMH levels were categorized as normal, low, or undetectable, and FSH levels were measured and used to identify pubertal females who had developed POI. Demographic and treatment data were abstracted from the institutional database and medical records, and a descriptive statistical analysis was conducted. Of the 17 patients in the study cohort, 14 had been treated with hydroxyurea and 3 had chronic transfusions but with no significant iron overload. AMH levels were normal in 15 patients (88%) and low in 2 patients (12%) at baseline. The median age at HCT was 7.5 years (range, 3.7 to 20.3 years), and 14 patients (82%) underwent matched related donor HCT. After HCT, 15 patients (88%) had undetectable AMH and 2 (12%) had low AMH, with no apparent differences by HCT conditioning regimen. No pubertal patients had POI at baseline, whereas 55% of pubertal patients had progressed to POI by 2 years post-HCT. In this cohort, the majority of females had normal AMH levels at baseline but undetectable levels after HCT. Females with SCD considering HCT should be counseled about the treatment-related risk of gonadal dysfunction.   2022 American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.

35320302		Perspectives of individuals with sickle cell disease on barriers to care.INTRODUCTION: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited hemoglobinopathy that predominantly affects African Americans in the United States. The disease is associated with complications leading to high healthcare utilization rates, including emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations. Optimal SCD care requires a multidisciplinary approach involving SCD specialists to ensure preventive care, minimize complications and prevent unnecessary ED visits and hospitalizations. However, most individuals with SCD receive sub-optimal care or are unaffiliated with care (have not seen an SCD specialist). We aimed to identify barriers to care from the perspective of individuals with SCD in a multi-state sample. METHODS: We performed a multiple methods study consisting of surveys and interviews in three comprehensive SCD centers from March to June 2018. Interviews were transcribed and coded, exploring themes around barriers to care. Survey questions on the specific themes identified in the interviews were analyzed using summary statistics. RESULTS: We administered surveys to 208 individuals and conducted 44 in-depth interviews. Barriers to care were identified and classified according to ecological level (i.e., individual, family/interpersonal, provider, and socio-environmental/organizational level). Individual-level barriers included lack of knowledge in self-management and disease severity. Family/interpersonal level barriers were inadequate caregiver support and competing life demands. Provider level barriers were limited provider knowledge, provider inexperience, poor provider-patient relationship, being treated differently, and the provider's lack of appreciation of the patient's SCD knowledge. Socio-environmental/organizational level barriers included limited transportation, lack of insurance, administrative barriers, poor care coordination, and reduced access to care due to limited clinic availability, services provided or clinic refusal to provide SCD care. CONCLUSION: Participants reported several multilevel barriers to SCD care. Strategies tailored towards reducing these barriers are warranted. Our findings may also inform interventions aiming to locate and link unaffiliated individuals to care.

Our aim was to extend the analysis to gene-spanning haplotypes of COMT SNPs and DRD3 SNPs to investigate possible associations with pain intensity and pain-related acute care utilization in an SCD cohort. Genotyping was conducted, and clinical data were collected, including self-reported pain intensity using PAINReportIt  (average of current pain and least and worst in past 24 hours, average pain intensity [API]) and medical record-extracted, pain-related acute care utilization data of 130 adults with SCD. Haplotype blocks were identified based on linkage disequilibria (COMT = 7 haploblocks; DRD3 = 8 haploblocks). Regression analyses were tested for association between haplotypes and API and utilization, yielding several significant findings. For COMT block 1 (rs2075507, rs4646310, rs737865), the A-G-G haplotype was associated with higher API compared to the reference A-G-A (p = 0.02), whereas the A-A-A haplotype was associated with higher utilization (p = 0.02). For DRD3 block 2 (rs9817063, rs2134655, rs963468, and rs3773679), relative to reference T-C-G-C, the T-T-G-C haplotype was associated with higher utilization (p = 0.01). For DRD3 block 4 (rs167770, rs324029, and rs324023), the A-G-T haplotype was associated with higher API (p = 0.04) and utilization (p < 0.001) relative to reference G-A-T, whereas the A-A-T haplotype was associated with higher utilization (p = 0.01). We found COMT and DRD3 haplotypes associated with pain-related SCD features, suggesting that in future studies more emphasis be placed on cis effects of SNP alleles in evaluating genetic contributions to SCD pain and acute care utilization for pain.
34537420		Haploidentical Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation in Sickle Cell Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT) is the sole established curative treatment option for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). However, a lack of HLA-identical sibling donors is a limiting factor. Haploidentical related donors are a promising donor pool, potentially extending SCT as a curative treatment option to a larger group of patients with no other meaningful treatment options for their severe SCD. In the present study, we aimed to systematically review the results of haploidentical SCT in patients with SCD. A comprehensive search was performed in MEDLINE/PubMed and Embase up to May 2021. Data were extracted by 2 reviewers independently, and the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale was used to assess the quality of the studies. Fourteen studies met our inclusion criteria. To provide an overview of the results of haploidentical SCT, we grouped the studies into myeloablative conditioning versus nonmyeloablative conditioning as well as into in vitro versus in vivo (ie, with post-transplantation cyclophosphamide) T cell depletion with a subgroup meta-analysis of proportions. All the included studies were observational cohort studies. Only 3 of these studies reported data for both matched sibling donor (MSD) SCT and haploidentical SCT. Based on a comparative meta-analysis of the 3 studies that included both haploidentical and MSD transplantation, graft failure was significantly higher in the haploidentical group than in the MSD group (odds ratio, 5.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0 to 27.6). Overall survival was not significantly different between the groups. A subgroup meta-analysis of the results of haploidentical SCT showed relatively low overall pooled proportions of graft failure (7%; 95% CI, 2% to 20%), acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (4%; 95% CI, 2% to 12%), and chronic GVHD (11%; 95% CI, 7% to 16%). Overall survival (OS) was high in all the included studies (91%; 95% CI, 85% to 94%). Adjustments to the conditioning regimens, robust pretransplantation and post-transplantation T cell depletion, and improved supportive care have resulted in reduced graft failure and improved OS following haploidentical SCT in patients with SCD. We conclude that the safety of haploidentical SCT in SCD patients has improved significantly, and that this should be considered as a curative option in patients with severe SCD.
36058780		Acute and chronic pain management in patients with sickle cell disease in the modern era: a comprehensive review.Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common inherited red blood cell (RBC) disorder worldwide, resulting in chronic hemolytic anemia, vaso-occlusion, tissue hypoxia, and ultimately end organ damage. The hallmark of the disease is manifested by vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) resulting in acute on chronic pain, and the most common cause for presentation to the emergency department and hospital admission. The management of pain for patients with SCD in the U.S. has historically been socially and politically complex with most patients experiencing pain on a daily basis but not seeking immediate medical attention. The pathophysiology of acute and chronic pain in SCD is multifactorial and complex. Here, we describe factors contributing to acute and chronic pain in SCD and management strategies.
38246310		Computing Sickle Erythrocyte Health Index on quantitative phase imaging and machine learning.Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder characterized by abnormal hemoglobin and deformation of red blood cells (RBCs), leading to complications and reduced life expectancy. This study developed an in vitro assessment, the Sickle Erythrocyte Health Index, using quantitative phase imaging (QPI) and machine learning to model the health of RBCs in people with SCD. The health index combines assessment of cell deformation, sickle-shaped classification, and membrane flexibility to evaluate erythrocyte health. Using QPI and image processing, the percentage of sickle-shaped cells and membrane flexibility were quantified. Statistically significant differences were observed between individuals with and without SCD, indicating the impact of underlying pathophysiology on erythrocyte health. Additionally, sodium metabisulfite led to an increase in sickle-shaped cells and a decrease in flexibility in the sickle cell blood samples. Based on these findings, two approaches were used to calculate the Sickle Erythrocyte Health Index: one using hand-crafted features and one using learned features from deep learning models. Both indices showed significant differences between non-SCD and SCD groups and sensitivity to changes induced by sodium metabisulfite. The Sickle Erythrocyte Health Index has important clinical implications for SCD management and could be used by providers when making treatment decisions. Further research is warranted to evaluate the clinical utility and applicability of the Sickle Erythrocyte Health Index in diverse patient populations.
35302009		Long-term Survival after Hematopoietic Cell Transplant for Sickle Cell Disease Compared to the United States Population.Hematopoietic cell transplant for sickle cell disease is curative but is associated with life threatening complications most of which occur within the first 2 years after transplantation. In the current era with interest in gene therapy and gene editing we felt it timely to report on sickle cell disease transplant recipients who were alive for at least 2-year after transplantation, not previously reported. Our objectives were to (1) report the conditional survival rates of patients who were alive for 2 or more years after transplantation (2) identify risk factors for death beyond 2 years after transplantation and (3) compare all-cause mortality risks to those of an age-, sex- and race-matched general population in the United States. By limiting to 2-year survivors, we exclude deaths that occur as a direct consequence of the transplantation procedure. De-identified records of 1149 patients were reviewed from a publicly available data source and 950 patients were eligible (https://picsure.biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov). All analyses were performed in this secure cloud environment using the available statistical software package(s). The validity of the public database was confirmed by reproducing results from an earlier publication. Conditional survival estimates were obtained using the Kaplan-Meier method for the sub-cohort that had survived a given length (x) of time after transplantation. Cox regression models were built to identify risk factors associated with mortality beyond 2 years after transplantation. The standardized relative mortality risk (SMR) or the ratio of observed to expected number of deaths, was used to quantify all-cause mortality risk after transplantation and compared to age, race and sex-matched general population. Person-years at risk were calculated from an anchor date (i.e., 2-, 5- and 7-years) after transplantation until date of death or last date known alive. The expected number of deaths was calculated using age, race and sex-specific US mortality rates. The median follow up was 5 years (range 2-20) and 300 (32%) patients were observed for more than 7 years. Among those who lived for at least 7 years after transplantation the 12-year probability of survival was 97% (95% CI, 92%-99%). Compared to an age-, race- and sex-matched US population, the risk for late death after transplantation was higher as late as 7 years after transplantation (hazard ratio (HR) 3.2; P= .020) but the risk receded over time. Risk factors for late death included age at transplant and donor type. For every 10-year increment in patient age, an older patient was 1.75 times more likely to die than a younger patient (P= .0004). Compared to HLA-matched siblings the use of other donors was associated with higher risk for late death (HR 3.49; P= .003). Graft failure (beyond 2-years after transplantation) was 7% (95% CI, 5%-9%) and graft failure was higher after transplantation of grafts from donors who were not HLA-matched siblings (HR 2.59, P< .0001). Long-term survival after transplantation is excellent and support this treatment as a cure for sickle cell disease. The expected risk for death recedes over time but the risk for late death is not negligible.

The number and characteristics of HbF-containing cells (F-cells) are not assessed by traditional HbF measurements. Conventional hydroxyurea dosing (e.g. fixed doses or low starting doses with stepwise escalation) produces a moderate heterocellular HbF induction, but haemolysis and clinical complications continue. Robust, pancellular HbF induction is needed to minimise or fully inhibit polymerisation of sickle haemoglobin. We treated children with hydroxyurea using an individualised, pharmacokinetics-guided regimen starting at predicted maximum tolerated dose (MTD). We observed sustained HbF induction (mean >30%) for up to 6 years, which was not dependent on genetic determinants of HbF expression. Nearly 70% of patients had >=80% F-cells (near-pancellular), and almost half had >=90% F-cells (pancellular). The mean HbF/F-cell content was ~12 pg. Earlier age of initiation and better medication adherence were associated with high F-cell responses. In summary, early initiation of hydroxyurea using pharmacokinetics-guided starting doses at predicted MTD can achieve sustained near-pancellular or pancellular HbF expression and should be considered an achievable goal for children with SCA treated with hydroxyurea at optimal doses.

37653351		Kidney failure outcomes in children and young adults with sickle cell disease in the United States Renal Data System.BACKGROUND: Children and young adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) develop kidney disease early in childhood, with some patients progressing to require dialysis and kidney transplantation. The prevalence and outcomes of children with kidney failure (chronic kidney disease stage 5) due to SCD are not well described. This study aimed to assess the outcome of children and young adults with SCD with kidney failure compared to matched children and young adults without SCD with kidney failure in a large national database. METHODS: Utilizing the United States Renal Data System (USRDS), we retrospectively examined kidney failure outcomes in children and young adults with SCD from 1998 to 2019. RESULTS: We identified 97 patients with SCD who developed kidney failure and identified 96 matched controls with a median age of 19 years (IQR 17, 21) at the time of kidney failure diagnosis. SCD patients had significantly shorter survival (8.4 years vs. 14.0 years, p < 0.001) and had a longer waiting time for their first transplant when compared to matched non-SCD kidney failure patients (12.1 years vs. 7.3 years, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Children and young adults with SCD kidney failure have significantly higher mortality when matched to non-SCD kidney failure children and experience a longer mean time to kidney transplant.

A high-throughput nucleic acid-based method in newborn screening (NBS) has been shown to be fast and cost-effective in the early detection of these diseases. Screening for SCD has been included in Germany's NBS Program since Fall 2021 and typically requires high-throughput NBS laboratories to adopt analytical platforms that are demanding in terms of instrumentation and personnel. Thus, we developed a combined approach applying a multiplexed quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assay for simultaneous SCID, SMA, and 1st-tier SCD screening, followed by a tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) assay for 2nd-tier SCD screening. DNA is extracted from a 3.2-mm dried blood spot from which we simultaneously quantify T-cell receptor excision circles for SCID screening, identify the homozygous SMN1 exon 7 deletion for SMA screening, and determine the integrity of the DNA extraction through the quantification of a housekeeping gene. In our two-tier SCD screening strategy, our multiplex qPCR identifies samples carrying the HBB: c.20A>T allele that is coding for sickle cell hemoglobin (HbS). Subsequently, the 2nd tier MS/MS assay is used to distinguish heterozygous HbS/A carriers from samples of patients with homozygous or compound heterozygous SCD. Between July 2021 and March 2022, 96,015 samples were screened by applying the newly implemented assay. The screening revealed two positive SCID cases, while 14 newborns with SMA were detected. Concurrently, the qPCR assay registered HbS in 431 samples which were submitted to 2nd-tier SCD screening, resulting in 17 HbS/S, five HbS/C, and two HbS/beta thalassemia patients. The results of our quadruplex qPCR assay demonstrate a cost-effective and fast approach for a combined screening of three diseases that benefit from nucleic-acid based methods in high-throughput NBS laboratories.

The latter may be caused by chronic thromboembolic disease of pulmonary artery branches and its management is not well-defined. Herein, we present a case of SCD complicated by chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension of subsegmental pulmonary artery branches successfully treated with endothelin receptor antagonists, orally administered prostacyclin analogs and balloon pulmonary angioplasty. This challenging case highlights the need for clinical awareness of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension as a specific and potentially curable form of pulmonary hypertension complicating SCD course that may necessitate combined pharmacologic and interventional management.
36924810		Brain BOLD and NIRS response to hyperoxic challenge in sickle cell disease and chronic anemias.PURPOSE: Congenital anemias, including sickle cell anemia and thalassemia, are associated with cerebral tissue hypoxia and heightened stroke risks. Recent works in sickle cell disease mouse models have suggested that hyperoxia respiratory challenges can identify regions of the brain having chronic tissue hypoxia. Therefore, this work investigated differences in hyperoxic response and regional cerebral oxygenation between anemic and healthy subjects. METHODS: A cohort of 38 sickle cell disease subjects (age 22 +- 8 years, female 39%), 25 non-sickle anemic subjects (age 25 +- 11 years, female 52%), and 31 healthy controls (age 25 +- 10 years, female 68%) were examined. A hyperoxic gas challenge was performed with concurrent acquisition of blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) MRI and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). In addition to hyperoxia-induced changes in BOLD and NIRS, global measurements of cerebral blood flow, oxygen delivery, and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen were obtained and compared between the three groups. RESULTS: Regional BOLD changes were not able to identify brain regions of flow limitation in chronically anemic patients. Higher blood oxygen content and tissue oxygenation were observed during hyperoxia gas challenge. Both control and anemic groups demonstrated lower blood flow, oxygen delivery, and metabolic rate compared to baseline, but the oxygen metabolism in anemic subjects were abnormally low during hyperoxic exposure. CONCLUSION: These results indicated that hyperoxic respiratory challenge could not be used to identify chronically ischemic brain. Furthermore, the low hyperoxia-induced metabolic rate suggested potential negative effects of prolonged oxygen therapy and required further studies to evaluate the risk for hyperoxia-induced oxygen toxicity and cerebral dysfunction.
36002213	associate|@CHEMICAL_Folic_Acid|@DISEASE_COVID_19 ;compare|@CHEMICAL_Folic_Acid|@CHEMICAL_Methotrexate	Folic acid and methotrexate use and their association with COVID-19 diagnosis and mortality: a case-control analysis from the UK Biobank.OBJECTIVE: To determine if methotrexate or folic acid prescription was associated with differential risk for COVID-19 diagnosis or mortality. DESIGN: Case-control analysis. SETTING: The population-based UK Biobank (UKBB) cohort. PARTICIPANTS: Data from 380 380 UKBB participants with general practice prescription data for 2019-2021. Updated medical information was retrieved on 13 December 2021. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcomes of COVID-19 diagnosis and COVID-19-related mortality were analysed by multivariable logistic regression. Exposures evaluated were prescription of folic acid and/or methotrexate. Criteria for COVID-19 diagnosis were (1) a positive SARS-CoV-2 test or (2) ICD-10 code for confirmed COVID-19 (U07.1) or probable COVID-19 (U07.2) in hospital records, or death records. By these criteria, 26 003 individuals were identified with COVID-19 of whom 820 were known to have died from COVID-19. Logistic regression statistical models were adjusted for age sex, ethnicity, Townsend deprivation index, body mass index, smoking status, presence of rheumatoid arthritis, sickle cell disease, use of anticonvulsants, statins and iron supplements. RESULTS: Compared with people prescribed neither folic acid nor methotrexate, people prescribed folic acid supplementation had increased risk of diagnosis of COVID-19 (OR 1.51 (1.42-1.61)). The prescription of methotrexate with or without folic acid was not associated with COVID-19 diagnosis (p>=0.18). People prescribed folic acid supplementation had positive association with death after a diagnosis of COVID-19 (OR 2.64 (2.15-3.24)) in a fully adjusted model. The prescription of methotrexate in combination with folic acid was not associated with an increased risk for COVID-19-related death (1.07 (0.57-1.98)). CONCLUSIONS: We report an association of increased risk for COVID-19 diagnosis and COVID-19-related death in people prescribed folic acid supplementation. Our results also suggest that methotrexate might attenuate these associations.
36860093		Attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccine among pediatric patients with sickle cell disease and their caregivers.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate attitudes toward vaccination and vaccine uptake regarding coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among pediatric patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and their caregivers. PROCEDURE: Adolescent patients and caregivers of children with SCD were surveyed during routine clinic visits; we then conducted a logistic regression analysis to understand differences in vaccine status, while qualitative responses were coded thematically. RESULTS: Among respondents, the overall vaccination rate among adolescents and caregivers was 49% and 52%, respectively. Among the unvaccinated, 60% and 68% of adolescents and caregivers, respectively, preferred to remain unvaccinated, most commonly due to lack of perceived personal benefit from vaccination or mistrust in the vaccine. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that child's age (odds ratio [OR] = 1.1, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.0-1.2, p < .01) and caregiver education (measured by the Economic Hardship Index [EHI] score, OR = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.74-0.78, p < .05) were independent predictors of getting vaccinated. CONCLUSION: Despite the increased risk of severe illness due to COVID-19 in patients with SCD, vaccine hesitancy remains high in this population of families whose children have SCD. Fortunately, the reasons cited for deferring vaccination among those who are unvaccinated were largely due to barriers that may be overcome with quality communication around the utility of the vaccine and information about vaccine safety.
35731941		Transition for Adolescents and Young Adults With Sickle Cell Disease in a US Midwest Urban Center: A Multilevel Perspective on Barriers, Facilitators, and Future Directions.BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD), an inherited red blood cell disorder, primarily affects African Americans in the United States. Adolescents and young adults with SCD (AYA-SCD) are at risk of high morbidity and mortality when transitioning from pediatric to adult care. The goal of this qualitative study was to understand factors associated with optimal implementation of the AYA-SCD transition. METHODS: Participants were recruited from a large hospital system and the community. Interview guides included topics on access to primary and specialized care, beliefs and practices related to pain control, transition from pediatric to adult care, and patient experiences in the emergency department. Data were coded and analyzed using an inductive thematic coding approach in combination with a deductive coding approach using domains from the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). RESULTS: Fifty-nine participants, including 21 AYA-SCD from both the pediatric and adult clinics, 17 caregivers, 9 pediatric SCD providers, 6 adult SCD providers, and 6 emergency department providers, completed 11 focus groups and 5 semistructured interviews. Results identified multiple factors within the domains of CFIR including the outer setting, inner setting, individual characteristics, and intervention characteristics. Results were incorporated into a transition framework to inform local practice improvement. CONCLUSION: Our study highlights the importance of multilevel barriers and facilitators for AYA-SCD transition from pediatric to adult care. Future studies could use implementation science frameworks to understand local context and identify strategies and intervention characteristics to improve transition programming. These efforts will ultimately reduce health disparities and ensure health equity.
37463716		Factors influencing blood pressure fluctuation in pediatric patients with sickle cell disease in Saudi Arabia: A retrospective single-center cohort study.OBJECTIVES: To investigate changes in blood pressure (BP) among pediatric patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and determine the variables that might influence these changes. METHODS: A total of 100 pediatric patients with SCD who followed up in the pediatric outpatient clinic were recruited for this retrospective cohort study. Clinical data included anthropometric measures, average systolic and diastolic BP recorded during multiple follow-up visits, hemoglobin (Hb) level, serum creatinine, and hemoglobin S percentage. Blood pressure measurements were categorized according to the guidelines of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP, 2017). RESULTS: In this cohort, 68% of the patients had normal systolic BP, 13% had elevated systolic BP, 17% had stage 1 hypertension (HTN), while only 2% reported stage 2 HTN. Patients who were overweight had relatively high systolic BP compared to patients who were underweight (p=0.034) or had normal weight (p=0.023). The average systolic BP significantly correlates with body mass index (r= 0.377, p<0.001) and serum creatinine (r=0.369, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Pediatric overweight SCD patients exhibited higher average systolic BP than those underweight or normal weight. Body mass index and serum creatinine significantly influenced the average systolic BP more than the Hb level or Hb S percentage.
34251034		Low rates of transfusion-transmitted infection screening in chronically transfused adults with sickle cell disease.BACKGROUND: Adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) on chronic transfusion therapy are exposed to a large volume of blood products, thus increasing their risk of transfusion-associated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C (HCV), and hepatitis B (HBV). METHODS: We performed a systematic chart review of chronically transfused SCD subjects at the Johns Hopkins Sickle Cell Center for Adults between October 2014 and September 2019 to determine our Center's adherence to the 2014 National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) SCD guidelines for annual screening for Transfusion Transmitted infections (TTI) and assessed HBV immunity and HBV vaccination rates. RESULTS: The study included 85 subjects with a median age of 34 years (23-63); 52% were female. No subject received annual screening; 68 subjects (80%) were screened for HIV, 60 subjects (71%) for HCV and 53 subjects (62%) for HBV infections at least once in the study period. Of those screened, one patient was newly diagnosed with HCV infection, and none with HIV or HBV infection. Among 31 subjects tested for anti-Hepatitis B surface antibody, 16 subjects (52%) tested negative. Nineteen (20%) subjects had HBV vaccination documented. CONCLUSIONS: Low adherence to the NHLBI TTI screening guidelines, especially for HBV, highlights the resource intensiveness of this patient population. The low rates of anti-Hepatitis B surface antibody positivity highlight the need to confirm vaccination, provide boosters as indicated, and investigate the adults with SCD's immune response to HBV vaccination.
38206762		Managing sickle cell disease and related complications in pregnancy: results of an international Delphi panel.Data to guide evidence-based management of pregnant people with sickle cell disease (SCD) is limited. This international Delphi panel aimed to identify consensus among multidisciplinary experts for SCD management during pregnancy. The two-round Delphi process used questionnaires exploring seven topics (antenatal care, hydroxyurea use, transfusion, prevention of complications, treatment of complications, delivery and follow-up, and bottlenecks and knowledge gaps) developed by a steering committee. Thirteen panelists (hematologists, physiologists, obstetricians, maternal fetal medicine and transfusion medicine physicians) from the US, the UK, Turkey and France completed the first survey; 12 panelists completed the second round. Anonymized responses were collected and summarized by a contract research organization (Akkodis Belgium). Consensus/strong consensus was predefined as 75%-90% (9-10/12)/>90% ( 11/12) of panelists agreeing or disagreeing on a response to a predefined clinical scenario or statement. In several areas of SCD management, consensus was achieved: experts recommended performing at least monthly multidisciplinary antenatal follow-up, administering prophylactic aspirin for preeclampsia prevention between gestational weeks 12-36, initiating prophylactic transfusion therapy in certain cases, or choosing automated red blood cell exchange over other transfusion methods in patients with iron overload or severe acute chest syndrome. No consensus was reached on several topics including the prophylactic aspirin dose, indications for starting infection prophylaxis, routine use of prophylactic transfusions, or use of prophylactic transfusions for preventing fetal complications. These recommendations could inform clinical care for pregnant SCD patients in the absence of large clinical trials involving this population; the identified knowledge gaps can orient future research.
37147250		The implementation of automated red blood cell exchange (erythrocytapheresis) as a treatment modality in sickle cell disease patients: Single center experience.BACKGROUND: Improvements of health infrastructure, preventive care and clinical management is important to reduce the morbidity and mortality of sickle cell disease (SCD). OBJECTIVE: This prospective, investigator-initiated non-randomized open-label intervention, single centre study describes the implementation of the automated erythrocytapheresis in low-middle income country as a treatment modality for SCD patients to improve the standard of care and highlights its benefits and challenges. METHODOLOGY: Eligible patients with SCD who had overt stroke, abnormal/conditional transcranial doppler (TCD), or other indications were subjected to regular automated erythrocytapheresis program. RESULTS: From 18th Dec 2017 till 17th Dec 2022, 21 subjects were enrolled; seventeen (80.9 %) were Egyptian and four (19.1 %) were non-Egyptian (three Sudanese and one Nigerian). Totalling 133 sessions had been performed mainly in working hours with fluctuating frequency per month. All sessions maintained isovolumic status and were performed using central venous access. The target HbS concentration was set from the start; the mean final FCR % fraction was 51, most of the session (n = 78, 58.7 %) were able to achieve target FCR. The majority of session pass smoothly with no adverse event (n = 81, 60.9 %), except for certain challenges as shortage of the required blood (n = 38), hypotension (n = 2), hypocalcaemia (n = 2). CONCLUSION: Automated erythrocytapheresis is safe and effective modality for management of patients with sickle cell disease.

34419981		Core Decompression and Bone Marrow Aspirate Concentrate in the Treatment of Femoral Head Avascular Necrosis in Pediatric Sickle Cell Disease: Can We Improve Natural History?INTRODUCTION: Femoral head avascular necrosis (AVN) affects between 10% and 41% of children with sickle cell disease (SCD), resulting in the development of proximal femoral deformity and residual hip pain in the majority of patients without treatment. There have been multiple adult studies published on the outcomes of core decompression with and without the use of bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) injection both in idiopathic and SCD-related AVN with promising results, however, few studies have reported on outcomes in skeletally immature patients. PURPOSE: This study sought to report on a single surgeon's outcomes for core decompression with BMAC injection in pediatric patients with AVN of the femoral head secondary to underlying SCD. METHODS: A single-center, retrospective review was performed for pediatric patients undergoing core decompression with BMAC injection for femoral head AVN in patients with SCD with a minimum of 12-month follow-up. Demographic, radiographic, and clinical variable were collected. Patients were subdivided based upon presence of open femoral physes at the time of surgery. Successful treatment was defined as the ability to return to activities without limitations. RESULTS: A total of 13 patients (average age 14.1+-2.8 y, 84.6% male, 6 skeletally immature and 7 skeletally mature) with 18 affected extremities were identified. Open physes were present in 50% of operative extremities. Skeletally immature patient demonstrated reconstitution of the femoral head in 78% of cases and 89% demonstrated regression of at least 1 Steinberg grade and none had progression. Skeletally immature patients were significantly more likely to return to activities (100% vs. 55.6%, P=0.023) and achieve a final Tonnis grade <2 (89% vs. 44%, P=0.046). CONCLUSION: Core decompression appears to alter the natural history of AVN in skeletally immature patients with SCD. Skeletal immaturity was a positive prognostic factor for the ability to return to activities without pain and achieve a lower Tonnis grade at final follow-up.
36413684		Pregnancy and sickle cell disease: an overview of complications and suggested perinatal care.INTRODUCTION: Pregnancy in women with sickle cell disease (SCD) has been identified as high risk owing to increased incidence of materno-fetal complications across various studies and reports. These complications include consequences related to the underlying hemoglobinopathy; chronic anemia/associated inflammation, and pregnancy related including the risk for thromboembolism, bleeding and maternal mortality. Outcomes of neonates born to women with SCD has been suboptimal over the years with recent improvement due to strict monitoring, preventive and therapeutic measures. Much is yet to be unraveled regarding the optimal management of women with SCD during pregnancy, identifying target hemoglobin, delivery mode or timing among others. AREAS COVERED: This review includes a summary of available data of the maternal and fetal outcomes; in addition to current recommendations for monitoring and management of women with SCD during pregnancy. EXPERT OPINION: To have a successful pregnancy, women should be closely monitored, and interventions provided as needed to guarantee adequate management of anemia, as well as prevention, diagnosis and management of disease. They should also be educated regarding their reproductive health, emphasizing that pregnancy is possible, and achieving optimal results depends on providing adequate care in a health care facility with expertise in high-risk pregnancies and SCD.
34607344	negative_correlate|@CHEMICAL_Deferasirox|@CHEMICAL_Iron ;treat|@CHEMICAL_Deferasirox|@DISEASE_Cerebral_Infarction	Economic evaluation of regular transfusions for cerebral infarct recurrence in the Silent Cerebral Infarct Transfusion Trial.In 2020, the American Society of Hematology published evidence-based guidelines for cerebrovascular disease in individuals with sickle cell anemia (SCA). Although the guidelines were based on National Institutes of Health-sponsored randomized controlled trials, no cost-effectiveness analysis was completed for children with SCA and silent cerebral infarcts. We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing regular blood transfusion vs standard care using SIT (Silent Cerebral Infarct Transfusion) Trial participants. This analysis included a modified societal perspective with direct costs (hospitalization, emergency department visit, transfusion, outpatient care, and iron chelation) and indirect costs (special education). Direct medical costs were estimated from hospitalizations from SIT hospitals and unlinked aggregated hospital and outpatient costs from SIT sites by using the Pediatric Health Information System. Indirect costs were estimated from published literature. Effectiveness was prevention of infarct recurrence. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio using a 3-year time horizon (mean SIT Trial participant follow-up) compared transfusion vs standard care. A total of 196 participants received transfusions (n = 90) or standard care (n = 106), with a mean age of 10.0 years. Annual hospitalization costs were reduced by 54% for transfusions vs standard care ($4929 vs $10 802), but transfusion group outpatient costs added $22 454 to $137 022 per year. Special education cost savings were $2634 over 3 years for every infarct prevented. Transfusion therapy had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $22 025 per infarct prevented. Children with preexisting silent cerebral infarcts receiving blood transfusions had lower hospitalization costs but higher outpatient costs, primarily associated with the oral iron chelator deferasirox. Regular blood transfusion therapy is cost-effective for infarct recurrence in children with SCA. This trial is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00072761.
36459182	cause|@CHEMICAL_Gadolinium|@DISEASE_Fibrosis	Prognostic value of multiparametric cardiac magnetic resonance in sickle cell patients.The aim of this multicenter study was to prospectively assess the predictive value of multiparametric cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) for cardiovascular complications in sickle cell disease (SCD) patients. Among all patients with hemoglobinopathies consecutively enrolled in the Myocardial Iron Overload in Thalassemia (MIOT) Network, we selected 102 SCD patients (34.38 +- 12.67 years, 49 females). Myocardial iron overload (MIO) was measured by the multislice multiecho T2* technique. Atrial dimensions and biventricular function parameters were quantified by cine images. Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) images were acquired to detect focal myocardial fibrosis. At baseline CMR, only two patients had significant MIO (global heart T2* < 20 ms). During a mean follow-up of 63.01 +- 24.95 months, 11 cardiovascular events (10.8%) were registered: 3 pulmonary hypertension, 2 supraventricular arrhythmias, 1 heart failure, 1 death for heart failure, 1 pulmonary embolism, 1 peripheral vascular disease, 1 transient ischemic attack, and 1 death after acute chest syndrome. In the multivariate analysis, the independent CMR predictors of cardiovascular events were left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (hazard ratio-HR = 0.88; p = 0.025) and right ventricular (RV) mass index (HR = 1.09; p = 0.047). According to the receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis for adverse events, an LV ejection fraction < 58.9% and an RV mass index > 31 g/m2 were optimal cut-off values. Reduced left ventricular ejection fraction and increased right ventricular mass index showed a significant prognostic value in patients with SCD. Our data seem to suggest that CMR may be added as a screening tool for identifying SCD patients at high risk for cardiopulmonary and vascular diseases.

A child suffered from chronic recurrent hemolytic attacks and the related genes of hereditary hemolytic anemia were detected on her. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was conducted in the treatment of the patient. The patient was diagnosed as hemoglobin Bristol-Alesha and achieved complete recovery after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. For Bristol-Alesha, without characteristic clinical manifestation and specific biochemical examination, diagnosis is dependent on the gene mutation detection and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is an effective and curable method.
35843787	treat|@CHEMICAL_Phenylephrine|@DISEASE_Priapism ;treat|@CHEMICAL_Oxygen|@DISEASE_Hematologic_Diseases	Is urgent surgical management necessary for priapism in pediatric patients with hematologic conditions?INTRODUCTION: Acute priapism is usually considered a medical emergency that warrants prompt urologic evaluation and treatment. Efforts have been made to determine the optimal management strategy for pediatric priapism. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to assess differences in conservative, minimally-invasive, and operative management of acute priapism in the pediatric population. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study of pediatric patients with acute priapism from 2015 to 2021 at a single tertiary care children's hospital was conducted. Conservative, minimally-invasive, and operative approaches for the priapism episodes during these hospital encounters were analyzed. RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients were identified with a total of 61 cases of acute pediatric priapism were evaluated in the study period. Eight-three percent of patients were African-Americans, and 72% of patients had a history of sickle cell disease. Oxygen therapy (P = 0.001) and hydration with intravenous fluids (P = 0.00318) were more commonly utilized for hematologic-associated cases compared to other etiologies. For priapism episodes of hematologic etiology, 18 (40.0%) and 18 (40.0%) patients received phenylephrine injection and aspiration/irrigation (e.g., minimally-invasive therapy), respectively, while for the other causes of priapism, three (18.8%) and four (25.0%) received phenylephrine injection and aspiration/irrigation (e.g., minimally-invasive), respectively. Conservative and minimally-invasive treatment resulted in complete resolution of priapism in 27 (60%) and 16 (35.5%) patients with hematologic-associated priapism while 12 (75%) and 1 (6.3%) patients with other etiologies had resolution of priapism with conservative and minimally-invasive treatment, respectively. One patient received shunting in the hematologic group while two patients received shunting in the non-hematologic group (P = 0.1031). DISCUSSION: Hematologic disorders are the most common causes of priapism in children and adolescents. An overwhelming majority of priapism events in the pediatric population can be managed with conservative therapies including oxygenation and intravenous hydration as well as minimally-invasive procedures such as corporal aspiration, irrigation and/or injections. The utilization of corporal shunting, anesthesia, and hospital resources is infrequently necessary for pediatric priapism episodes. CONCLUSION: While urgent surgical management is often performed in the adult population, a minimally-invasive management strategy can be implemented in the pediatric population where an extended period of conservative management that avoids operative management and general anesthesia is effective.
34561714		Testicular Volume in Children with Sickle Cell Anaemia in Uyo, a South-South Nigerian City.INTRODUCTION: Sickle cell anaemia (SCA) often presents in early childhood with repeated vaso-occlusive crisis that leads to ischaemia, infarction and fibrosis which may result in a reduction in expected testicular volume (TV) at puberty. METHOD: This was a cross-sectional study of 95 children with SCA aged 1-18 years compared with 95 age-matched controls. Participants responded to an interviewer-administered questionnaire, with their anthropometric measurements taken, pubertal maturity assessed by Tanner staging and testicular ultrasonography done. Changes in TV across the ages were compared graphically and regression analyses were used to determine the factors independently associated with TV. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: In the prepubertal period, the haemoglobin SS (HbSS) participants had larger median ultrasound TV (MUSTV) compared to the haemoglobin AA (HbAA) controls (p = 0.001). This trend reversed in the pubertal period. On regression analysis, the frequency of testicular pain (p = 0.04), weight (p = 0.02) and pubic hair rating (p = 0.03) of the HbSS participants were significant predictors of increased TVs in the HbSS participants, irrespective of pubertal status. CONCLUSION: The prepubertal MUSTV of the HbSS participants were higher than those of the HbAA controls, while the HbAA controls had higher MUSTV at puberty and beyond. The frequency of testicular pain episodes, pubic hair rating and weight were independent predictors of TV changes in the HbSS participants. Prevention of repeated vaso-occlusive crisis in the prepubertal period may help prevent the reduction in TV and possible hypogonadism. Lay summarySickle cell anaemia (SCA) causes repeated episodes of painful crisis and in boys, these may affect the way their testes grow. The study set out to document testicular sizes on a one-time basis in boys aged 1-18 years with SCA compared with controls of similar ages. The participants responded to structured questions assisted by the researchers and their body measurements were appropriately taken. Their level of sexual maturation was assessed according to the method by Tanner and the sizes of their testes were measured using an ultrasound machine. The research information was analysed and a statistical value less than 0.05 was taken to mean that there was a difference between the measured variables. The mid-testicular sizes of the SCA participants were noted to be higher than that of their controls during the prepubertal period while the non-SCA boys had higher sizes from puberty onwards. The frequency of testicular pain, weight and pubic hair stage of the SCA boys were important contributors to their increased testes sizes, irrespective of pubertal status. Efforts aimed at preventing painful crisis should start during early childhood to forestall future sexual challenges in adulthood.
34420880		Alloimmunization in transfused patients with constitutional anemias in Norway.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The status of red blood cell alloimmunization in patients with constitutional anemias including hemoglobinopathies is not known in Norway. The study objective was to investigate the impact of a strategy based on phenotype-matching for C, c, E, e, K, Jka, Jkb, Fya, Fyb, S and s on alloimmunization. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed transfusions of 40 patients retrospectively using the computerized blood bank management system and medical records; including diagnosis, age at start of transfusion therapy, gender, number and age of packed red blood cell units transfused, follow-up time, phenotypes of the donors and patients, antigen-negative patients exposed to antigen-positive packed red blood cell units, transfusion reactions and alloantibody specificities. RESULTS: Forty patients received 5402 packed red blood cell units. Alloimmunization frequency was 20 % for the whole group, being 7%, 25 % and 30 % in patients with sickle cell disease (n = 14), thalassemia (n = 16) and other conditions (n = 10), respectively. The alloantibodies detected were anti-E, -c, -C, -Cw, -K, -Jka and -Lua. CONCLUSION: Good communication between the clinicians and the transfusion services is essential for successful management of patients with constitutional anemias. Providing full phenotype-matched units was not always possible. Extended pheno-/genotyping before the first transfusion and providing antigen-negative units for antigen-negative patients for at least C, c, E and K in every red cell transfusion would probably have reduced the alloimmunization rate. Non-phenotype-matched transfusions seem to be the main reason for alloimmunization. Finding markers for identifying responders prone to alloimmunization will ensure targeted transfusion strategies.

35848827	treat|@CHEMICAL_voxelotor|@DISEASE_Hemolysis ;treat|@CHEMICAL_voxelotor|@DISEASE_Anemia ;treat|@CHEMICAL_voxelotor|@DISEASE_Androgen_Insensitivity_Syndrome ;treat|@CHEMICAL_voxelotor|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell	Urgent use of voxelotor in sickle cell disease when immediate transfusion is not safe.The use of blood transfusions to improve anemia resulting from sickle cell disease (SCD) is often limited by alloimmunization, which occurs due to exposure to incompatible antigen present on donor red blood cells (RBCs). This complication occasionally manifests as delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions (DHTRs) that cause hemolysis of the recipient's own RBCs and can lead to fatal anemia. In this case study, we report a patient with SCD who experienced a DHTR following chronic transfusion and was successfully treated with voxelotor, an orally administered sickle hemoglobin (HbS) polymerization inhibitor for the treatment of SCD. Laboratory tests following admission indicated pan-reactivity in antigens, and a rare donor registry was used to locate acceptable units. The patient experienced the DHTR 3 days after admission, which limited laboratory tests due to profound hemolysis. Alternative treatments were limited, and phenotypically matched units were incompatible, so voxelotor was selected as a last-resort treatment. Following initiation of voxelotor 1500 mg, the patient's hemoglobin levels returned to baseline (6 g/dl) within 10 days, with clinical improvements. This report provides evidence regarding the use of voxelotor in the treatment of profound anemia where other treatments could be unsafe or unavailable.

Following HCT, sirolimus is an immunosuppressant used to prevent graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) while receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) for Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis and other antimicrobial agents (including acyclovir). One rare adverse event associated with both drugs is rhabdomyolysis, defined as creatine kinase (CK) elevation at least 5 to 10 times the upper limit of normal. This study was conducted to evaluate the rate of and risk factors for developing rhabdomyolysis in the post-HCT setting. Across 4 haploidentical and matched related donor (MRD) nonmyeloablative protocols, CK levels were prospectively monitored and patients were retrospectively identified for rhabdomyolysis. The rhabdomyolysis was graded based on the severity of CK elevation and other organ injury. At diagnosis, patients were queried for concurrent medication use (ie, sirolimus, TMP-SMX, acyclovir, or statins), sex, age, donor genotype, and time from transplantation. Among 127 patients with mostly SCD, rhabdomyolysis occurred in 22 (17%), including 2 recipients of haploidentical donor HCT and 20 recipients of MRD HCT. The time to the development of rhabdomyolysis was 61 and 73 days for the 2 recipients of haploidentical HCT and a median of 73 days for the MRD HCT recipients. Among the 22 patients who developed rhabdomyolysis, 20 (91%) were receiving sirolimus (2 haploidentical HCT recipients and 18 MRD HCT recipients), and 14 (64%) were also receiving TMP-SMX (all in the MRD HCT group). Seventy-five percent of the haploidentical donors and 69% of the MRDs had sickle cell trait. All but 2 patients with rhabdomyolysis were male. No patients who developed rhabdomyolysis were receiving statins at any point. Higher-than-expected rates of rhabdomyolysis were found post-transplantation for patients with SCD and beta-thalassemia. Contributing risk factors included immunosuppression with sirolimus, TMP-SMX, male sex, and sickle trait donor. These factors differ from the excessive muscle strain or injury, seizures, infections, or HMG-CoA inhibitors typically identified in non-HCT recipients.
37282348	treat|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Stroke	Relationship between hemoglobin, hemolysis, and transcranial Doppler velocities in children with sickle cell disease: Results from a long-term natural history study in Italy in the era of multimodal therapy.BACKGROUND: Stroke and cerebral vasculopathy are leading causes of morbidity and mortality in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Transcranial Doppler (TCD) is a reliable and validated predictor of stroke risk. Children with conditional or abnormal TCD are at an increased risk for stroke, which can be mitigated by red blood cell transfusion or hydroxyurea. Elucidating the relationship between cerebral hemodynamics and hemolytic anemia can help identify novel therapeutic approaches to reduce stroke risk and transfusion dependence. METHODS: This long-term, real-world study was designed to evaluate the prevalence of TCD imaging (TCDi)-assessed flow velocities in children and to interrogate their relationship with markers of anemia and hemolysis. RESULTS: In total, 155 children (median follow-up 79.8 months, 1358.44 patient-years) had 583 evaluable TCDi results. Only patients with HbSS or HbSbeta0 had abnormal (1.6%) or conditional (10.9%) TCDi. Children with abnormal or conditional TCDi had lower hemoglobin (Hb) and higher hemolysis markers. A linear correlation was detected between TCD velocity and Hb: an Hb increase of 1 g/dL corresponded to decreases in velocity in the internal carotid and middle cerebral arteries (6.137 cm/s and 7.243 cm/s). Moreover, patients with Hb >9 g/dL presented a lower risk of TCDi-associated events. CONCLUSION: These results support the need to optimize disease-modifying treatments that increase Hb and reduce hemolysis for stroke prevention in young children with SCD.

37466724		Survival of total hip arthroplasty (THA) in sickle cell disease.BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to evaluate the outcome of THA done in patients with sickle cell disease at a single center, and compare with rest of the world before we could recommend routine THA in SCD patients. METHODS: In 92 patients, 117 THAs were performed in sickle cell patients. Seventy-six (76) patients had homozygous hemoglobin (Hgb SS) disease, whereas sixteen had sickle cell trait (Hgb AS). Patients with Grade III Ficat and above avascular necrosis of the head of femur (ANFH) with cementless porous-coated proximal femur fixation were included in this analysis. Harris hip score was modified (MHHS) and used for assessment of improvement and visual analog scale score (VAS), for pain assessment. RESULT: VAS improved from average pre-operative mean of 7 (7-9) to 2.5 (1-5). The average pre-operative MHHS was 44 (32-63), and it improved to 79 (71-88) in the final mean follow-up of 12.4 (4-18) years. Nine patients (9.7%) had complications and revision surgery was required in seven (5.9%) for aseptic loosening. CONCLUSION: Our analysis shows that THA in sickle cell disease is safe with average 12 years of follow-up, indicating that surgery in these young patients (<= 25 years) is safe and should not be delayed.
33773449		Dual-energy CT evidence of pulmonary microvascular occlusion in patients with sickle cell disease experiencing acute chest syndrome.PURPOSE: Acute chest syndrome (ACS), defined by the presence of a chest radiographic opacity in sickle cell disease patients experiencing respiratory symptoms is a leading cause of death in these patients. The etiology is ACS is not well understood however pulmonary microvascular occlusion has been postulated to be a major pathophysiologic driver. Our study aims to assess the value of dual-energy CT (DECT) as a marker of pulmonary microvascular occlusion. MATERIALS/METHODS: A search tool was used to identify CT angiography studies from 1/1/2017 to 9/15/2019 with any variation of the phrases "Acute chest syndrome" and "Sickle cell". These studies were manually reviewed for the use of DECT technique. An age-matched control group was created. DECT pulmonary blood volume (PBV) maps were reviewed semi-quantitatively for the presence of iodine defects and the number of involved bronchopulmonary segments were scored. Other recorded values included type of parenchymal opacities, diameter of main pulmonary artery (MPA) and presence of right ventricular dilatation. Mean values between cases and controls were compared using a two-sample t-test. RESULTS: Nine sickle cell DECT cases with PBV maps and nine age-matched controls were evaluated. Bronchopulmonary segments with iodine defects were significantly higher in cases vs controls (mean: 4.7 vs 0.3, p < 0.003). PBV defects were more extensive than parenchymal findings. MPA diameter was higher in cases (2.9 cm) vs control (2.4 cm), P < 0.03. CONCLUSIONS: DECT demonstrates abnormal PBV in sickle cell patients, often the predominant abnormality identified early, and likely reflects the presence of pulmonary microvascular occlusion.
34846319		Breaking the Cycle: Care Coordination Interventions and Sickle Cell Readmissions.PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: Approximately 100,000 people in the United States are affected by sickle cell disease (SCD). Sickle cell disease represents one of the highest readmitting diagnoses at this organization. The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of implementing care coordination interventions to reduce hospital readmissions of patients with SCD. PRIMARY PRACTICE SETTING: The setting for conducting the interventions took place at the flagship hospital of a seven hospital system in Houston, TX. The hospital is a not-for-profit, faith-based, 907-bed academic facility that provides highly specialized health services to the community and the world. The population of focus was adult patients (18 years of age and older) admitted to the hospital with a primary diagnosis of SCD. FINDINGS/CONCLUSION: Two interventions were implemented: Disease-specific discharge education and scheduling postdischarge follow-up appointments prior to discharge. These interventions were conducted by bedside nurses, case managers, and SCD champions over a 6-month period. The 30-day readmission rate for SCD was reduced by 22%. There was also a 0.9-day reduction in length of stay and a 17% reduction in emergency, observation, and inpatient encounters of patients with SCD. IMPLICATIONS FOR CASE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES: This project found that implementing evidence-based care coordination interventions can reduce the 30-day readmission rate for patients with SCD. Implementation of effective evidence-based care coordination is a key aspect to reducing hospital readmissions of patients with SCD. Partnering with community networks is also important in addressing readmission risk factors including management of social determinants of health that increase hospital visits. Consistent, patient-centered education using simple and convenient tools helps improve understanding, applicability, and self-care management.

However, its clinical usefulness in beta-thalassaemia is unproven. We conducted a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of hydroxyurea in transfusion-dependent beta-thalassaemia. Sixty patients were assigned 1:1 to oral hydroxyurea 10-20 mg/kg/day or placebo for 6 months by stratified block randomisation. Hydroxyurea treatment did not alter the blood transfusion volume overall. However, a significantly higher proportion of patients on hydroxyurea showed increases in fetal haemoglobin percentage (89% vs. 59%; p < 0.05) and reductions in erythropoietic stress as measured by soluble transferrin receptor concentration (79% vs. 40%; p < 0.05). Based on fetal haemoglobin induction (> 1.5%), 44% of patients were identified as hydroxyurea-responders. Hydroxyurea-responders, required significantly lower blood volume (77 +- SD27ml/kg) compared to hydroxyurea-non-responders (108 +- SD24ml/kg; p < 0.01) and placebo-receivers (102 +- 28ml/kg; p < 0.05). Response to hydroxyurea was significantly higher in patients with HbE beta-thalassaemia genotype (50% vs. 0%; p < 0.01) and Xmn1 polymorphism of the gamma-globin gene (67% vs. 27%; p < 0.05). We conclude that oral hydroxyurea increased fetal haemoglobin percentage and reduced erythropoietic stress of ineffective erythropoiesis in patients with transfusion-dependent beta-thalassaemia. Hydroxyurea reduced the transfusion burden in approximately 40% of patients. Response to hydroxyurea was higher in patients with HbE beta-thalassaemia genotype and Xmn1 polymorphism of the gamma-globin gene.
36748667		Successful therapeutic plasma exchange for a patient with sickle cell disease and fat embolism syndrome after a failure of a response to red cell exchange transfusion.BACKGROUND: Fat embolism syndrome (FES) is a rare complication, which was reported mostly with milder forms of heterozygous sickle cell disease (SCD). It may present in a catastrophic way with multi-organ failure, particularly involving the pulmonary and neurological systems. Diagnosis is often missed or delayed; and the standard recommended treatment is red cell exchange (RCE) transfusion, which has sub-optimal results, such as debilitating long-term neurological complications. Recently, few reports suggested that the addition of Therapeutic Plasma Exchange (TPE) might further improve the outcome. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 23-year-old woman with homozygote SCD was admitted with bony pains and vaso-occlusive crises. However, her course evolved to respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, decreased level of consciousness, skin rash, severe anemia and thrombocytopenia and a picture consistent with thrombotic microangiopathy. MRI of the brain showed scattered multi-focal ischemic foci and cytotoxic edema. The patient received RCE on the third day after admission without improvement. On the seventh day, TPE was instituted (2 L/day of fresh frozen plasma for 5 days), following which she regained her consciousness and showed an improvement in her laboratory abnormalities. On follow up, she had gradual full neurological recovery and resolution of the MRI findings within a few months. CONCLUSION: FES remains a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge, with significant morbidity and mortality. Success in the management of this reported case with the addition of TPE to RCE supports the notion that TPE may be a potentially helpful modality that deserves further research.
33958740		Stable to improved cardiac and pulmonary function in children with high-risk sickle cell disease following haploidentical stem cell transplantation.Children with sickle cell disease (SCD) are at high-risk of progressive, chronic pulmonary and cardiac dysfunction. In this prospective multicenter Phase II trial of myeloimmunoablative conditioning followed by haploidentical stem cell transplantation in children with high-risk SCD, 19 patients, 2.0-21.0 years of age, were enrolled with one or more of the following: history of (1) overt stroke; (2) silent stroke; (3) elevated transcranial Doppler velocity; (4) multiple vaso-occlusive crises; and/or (5) two or more acute chest syndromes and received haploidentical transplants from 18 parental donors. Cardiac and pulmonary centralized cores were established. Pulmonary function results were expressed as percent of the median of healthy reference cohorts, matched for age, sex, height and race. At 2 years, pulmonary functions including forced expiratory volume (FEV), FEV1/ forced vital capacity (FVC), total lung capacity (TLC), diffusing capacity of lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) were stable to improved compared to baseline values. Importantly, specific airway conductance was significantly improved at 2 years (p < 0.004). Left ventricular systolic function (fractional shortening) and tricuspid regurgitant velocity were stable at 2 years. These results demonstrate that haploidentical stem cell transplantation can stabilize or improve cardiopulmonary function in patients with SCD.

A few studies also suggest utility of HU, during acute VOC. Sickle cell anaemia (SCA) is of high prevalence in western districts of Odisha State, India, and VOC is a common presentation, despite being mostly of Arab-Indian haplotype. This study was undertaken to evaluate the impact of HU on hospital stay and analgesic utilization in acute painful VOC of SCA. Methods: Homozygous sickle cell disease (HbSS) patients were categorized as cases who were receiving low-dose HU (10 mg/kg/day) and patients who were not on HU were considered as control. Days of hospital stay, analgesic utilization and visual analogue scale (VAS) score in patients were compared with that of control. Analgesics used to control pain were tramadol hydrochloride, ketorolac and diclofenac. Results: A total of 359 homozygous sickle cell disease (SCD) patients with VOC were studied (187 patients and 172 controls). The patient group had lesser mean days of hospital stay (1.4 days less than controls, P<0.001) and required lesser days of analgesic utilization than controls (1.18 days less than controls, P<0.001). Significant differences were observed between patients and controls concerning VAS score and amount of tramadol hydrochloride, ketorolac and diclofenac utilization (P<0.05). Interpretation & conclusions: In this study, HU was found to have beneficial effects in acute VOC of homozygous SCD, which includes shortening the duration of hospital stay and reducing the net amount of analgesic utilization during hospitalization.
37756514		Underweight risk factors in older children with sickle cell anemia: a comparison of low- to high-income countries.Previously, we demonstrated that older children with sickle cell anemia (SCA) living in a low-income setting are at increased risk of death if they are underweight (weight-for-age z-score <-1). We now conducted a cross-sectional study in both low- and high-income settings to determine the consistent biological risk factors for being underweight across both low- and high-income settings for children aged 5-12 years old with SCA. The children from low- and high-income settings were eligible participants for the Primary Prevention of Stroke in Children with Sickle Cell Disease in Nigeria (SPRING, n=928) and the Silent Cerebral Infarct (SIT, North America/Europe, n=1,093) trials, respectively. The median age in the SPRING and SIT cohorts was 8.1 (IQR 6.3-10.3) and 8.5 (6.8-10.6) years, respectively (p=<0.001), and approximately half were male (49.0% and 50.8%, respectively, p=0.434). A total of 87.9% (n=816) of participants in SPRING (low-income) met the study criteria for underweight (weight-for-age z-score <-1) and 22.7% (n=211) for severely underweight (weight-for-age z-score <-3), significantly higher than the SIT (high-income) cohort at 25.7% (n=281) underweight and 0.7% (n=8) severely underweight (p<0.001 for both comparisons). In the combined cohort, older age (OR 1.24, p<0.001, 95% CI 1.17-1.31) and lower hemoglobin level (OR 0.67, p<0.001, 95% CI 0.60-0.75) were associated with being underweight. Age and hemoglobin level remained statistically significant in separate models for the SPRING and SIT cohorts. Older age and lower hemoglobin levels in children aged 5-12 with SCA are associated with increased odds of being underweight in both low- and high-income settings.
37158403		Impact of prenatal corticosteroid therapy on sickle cell disease in pregnant women.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate safety of prenatal corticosteroids in pregnancies of women with sickle cell disease. METHODS: A multicenter observational study of patients with sickle cell disease, comparing vaso-occlusive crises (VOC) requiring hospital care between pregnancies with versus without prenatal corticosteroids. RESULTS: In 40 pregnancies exposed to prenatal corticosteroids, compared with 370 unexposed pregnancies, VOC were not more frequent (62.5% vs 57.9%, P = 0.578) but they were more severe, with more intensive care hospitalizations (25.0% vs 12.9%, P = 0.039), emergency transfusions (44.7% vs 22.7%, P = 0.006), and acute chest syndromes (22.5% vs 8.9%, P = 0.010). These differences persisted after adjustment for severity and type of sickle cell syndrome (for intensive care admission adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.10-6.79, P = 0.031 and for acute chest syndrome aOR 4.15, 95% CI 1.57-14.4, P = 0.008). VOC occurred on average 1.2 days following steroid administration. When comparing 36 patients receiving corticosteroids for fetal maturation with 58 patients who were hospitalized for obstetrical complications before 34 weeks of pregnancy but that did not receive corticosteroids, VOC incidence was not significantly higher (41.7% vs 31.5%, P = 0.323). CONCLUSION: The present study was the first to study the impact of prenatal corticosteroids on sickle cell disease. They were associated with more severe VOC, suggesting that steroids should be avoided in these women.
35894886		Exercise Capacity and Biomarkers Among Children and Adolescents With Sickle Cell Disease.BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease is the most common genetic hemoglobinopathy globally and systemically affects body functioning, decreasing exercise capacity. OBJECTIVE: To assess exercise capacity through the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and biomarkers in children and adolescents with sickle cell disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cross-sectional study involving 20 children and adolescents from Brazil. Demographic and socioeconomic data were obtained. Baseline measurements included biomarkers (red blood cells, hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cells, platelets, reticulocytes, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine phosphokinase, C-reactive protein, interleukin 6, and fetal hemoglobin). The following data were obtained before, during, and after the 6MWT: heart rate, blood pressure, and peripheral oxygen saturation. RESULTS: Eighteen children and adolescents ages 5-14 years old were analyzed, 61.1% boys, 100% black or brown, and 61.1% in primary education, with low household income. The average distance walked in 6MWT was 463.8 (137.7) m, significantly less than the predicted value (P < .001). The distance of 6MWT was associated positively with age (P = .042) and inversely with reticulocyte count (P = .42) and interleukin 6 (P = .00). Age modified the effect of interleukin 6 in younger children (P = .038). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest increased baseline levels of biomarkers of hemolysis and inflammation impact on 6MWT performance.
36843202		Diagnostic challenges of renal medullary carcinoma and the role for cytologic assessment: Case report and literature review.BACKGROUND: Renal medullary carcinoma (RMC) is a diagnostically challenging, aggressive primary renal malignancy associated with abysmal survival. Delays in diagnosis contribute to most patients having diffusely metastatic disease at the time of initial presentation. METHODS: We present the case of a 13-year-old African American male with sickle cell trait who presented with a renal mass and hematuria. Evaluation included imaging, fluid cultures, and cytologic assessment. RESULTS: Patient was diagnosed with RMC based on cytologic assessment of sub-centimeter fluid collections aspirated from the left kidney at the time of cortical biopsy for suspected renal mass. The additional fluid aspiration in conjunction with renal biopsy was an atypical but crucial step in early diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Cytomorphologic evaluation of fluid biospecimens is not currently part of the standard work-up for patients with renal masses but, when available, can provide crucial information that reduces time to diagnosis. Prompt symptom recognition and treatment initiation may improve patient outcomes.
34738369		Evaluation of retinal nerve fiber layer and choroidal thickness with spectral domain optical coherence tomography in children with sickle cell anemia.BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to examine the thickness of choroidal, macular and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) in pediatric patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA) without retinopathy. METHODS: A total of 75 children (30 SCA patients (Group 1) and 45 healthy individuals (Group 2) were included in the study. Macular (central, superior, inferior, nasal, temporal), choroidal (subfoveal, at nasal distances from the central fovea of 1000 mum [N1], 2000 mum [N2], 3000 mum [N3], at temporal distances from the central fovea of 1000 mum [T1], 2000 mum [T2], 3000 mum [T3]) and RNFL (average, temporal, superotemporal, inferotemporal, nasal, inferonasal and superonasal) measurements were performed by SD-OCT. These parameters were compared with healthy children with similar demographic characteristics. RESULTS: The mean age was 14.11+-3.86 (11-18) in sickle cell anemia patients and 13.15+- 2.69 (10-18) in the healthy control group. Of the patients, 56.6% (n=17) of Group 1 and 44.4% (n=20) of Group 2 were male. Choroidal measurements made in the subfoveal, N1, N2, N3, T1, T2 and T3 quadrants showed that the choroid was thinner in 6 quadrants in SCA patients compared to the healthy group (p = 0.003, p = 0.039, p = 0.035, p = 0.595, p = 0.006, p = 0.005, p = 0.047, respectively). In RNFL measurements, there was significant thinning in the temporal, inferotemporal, and nasal quadrants of SCA patients compared to the healthy group. Changes in other quadrants were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: SD-OCT is a useful imaging method in the diagnosis and screening in patients with SCA without retinopathy. Early diagnosis of retinopathy during subclinical disease will prevent visual loss in these patients.
35836008		Phenotypes of sickle cell intensive care admissions: an unsupervised machine learning approach in a single-center retrospective cohort.Sickle cell disease (SCD) is associated with multiple known complications and increased mortality. This study aims to further understand the profile of intensive care unit (ICU) admissions of SCD patients. In this single-center retrospective cohort (approval number 0926-11), we evaluated SCD-related ICU admissions at our hospital in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Admissions were clustered using clinical data and organ dysfunction at ICU admission. A hierarchical clustering method was used to distinguish phenotypes. From 140 admissions obtained, 125 were included. The mean age was 30 years, 48% were male, and SS genotype was predominant (71.2%). Non-surgical causes of admissions accounted for 85.6% (n = 107). The mean Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (SOFA) was 4 (IQR 2-7). Vasopressors were required by 12% and mechanical ventilation by 17.6%. After analysis of the average silhouette width, the optimal number of clusters was 3: cluster 1 (n = 69), cluster 2 (n = 25), cluster 3 (n = 31). Cluster 1 had a mean age of 29 years, 87% of SS genotype, and mean SOFA of 4. Cluster 2 had a mean age of 37 years, 80% of SS genotype, and mean SOFA of 8. Cluster 3 had a mean age of 26 years, 29% of SS genotype, and mean SOFA of 3. The need for mechanical ventilation was 11.6%, 44%, and 9.7%, respectively. Mortality was significantly higher in cluster 2 (44%, p = 0.012). This cohort of critical SCD admissions suggested the presence of three different profiles. This can be informative in the ICU setting to identify SCD patients at higher risk of worse outcomes.

35289246		Reflex single-gene non-invasive prenatal testing is associated with markedly better detection of fetuses affected with single-gene recessive disorders at lower cost.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical benefits and achievable cost savings associated with the adoption of a carrier screen with reflex single-gene non-invasive prenatal test (sgNIPT) in prenatal care. METHOD: A decision-analytic model was developed to compare carrier screen with reflex sgNIPT (maternal carrier status and fetal risk reported together) as first-line carrier screening to the traditional carrier screening workflow (positive maternal carrier screen followed by paternal screening to evaluate fetal risk). The model compared the clinical outcomes and healthcare costs associated with the two screening methods. These results were used to simulate appropriate pricing for reflex sgNIPT. RESULTS: Reflex sgNIPT carrier screening-detected 108 of 110 affected pregnancies per 100,000 births (98.5% sensitivity), whereas traditional carrier screening-detected 46 of 110 affected pregnancies (41.5% sensitivity). The cost to identify one affected pregnancy was reduced by 62% in the reflex sgNIPT scenario compared to the traditional scenario. Adding together the testing cost savings and the savings from earlier clinical intervention made possible by reflex sgNIPT, the total cost savings was $37.6 million per 100,000 pregnancies. Based on these cost savings, we simulated appropriate reflex sgNIPT pricing range: if the cost to identify one affected pregnancy is the unit cost, carrier screening with reflex sgNIPT can be priced up to $1,859 per test (or $7,233 if sgNIPT is billed separately); if the cost per 100,000 pregnancies is the unit cost, carrier screening with sgNIPT can be priced up to $1,070 per test (or $2,336 if sgNIPT is billed separately). CONCLUSION: Using the carrier screen with reflex sgNIPT as first-line screening improves the detection of affected fetuses by 2.4-fold and can save costs for the healthcare system. A real-life experience will be needed to assess the clinical utility and exact cost savings of carrier screen with reflex sgNIPT.
34232511		A portable impedance microflow cytometer for measuring cellular response to hypoxia.This article presents the development and testing of a low-cost (<$60), portable, electrical impedance-based microflow cytometer for single-cell analysis under a controlled oxygen microenvironment. The system is based on an AD5933 impedance analyzer chip, a microfluidic chip, and an Arduino microcontroller operated by a custom Android application. A representative case study on human red blood cells (RBCs) affected by sickle cell disease is conducted to demonstrate the capability of the cytometry system. Impedance values of sickle blood samples exhibit remarkable deviations from the common reference line obtained from two normal blood samples. Such deviation is quantified by a conformity score, which allows for the measurement of intrapatient and interpatient variations of sickle cell disease. A low conformity score under oxygenated conditions or drastically different conformity scores between oxygenated and deoxygenated conditions can be used to differentiate a sickle blood sample from normal. Furthermore, an equivalent circuit model of a suspended biological cell is used to interpret the electrical impedance of single flowing RBCs. In response to hypoxia treatment, all samples, regardless of disease state, exhibit significant changes in at least one single-cell electrical property, that is, cytoplasmic resistance and membrane capacitance. The overall response to hypoxia is less in normal cells than those affected by sickle cell disease, where the change in membrane capacitance varies from -23% to seven times as compared with -17% in normal cells. The results reported in this article suggest that the developed method of testing demonstrates the potential application for a low-cost screening technique for sickle cell disease and other diseases in the field and low-resource settings. The developed system and methodology can be extended to analyze cellular response to hypoxia in other cell types.

SETTING: Cord blood samples from 13 hospitals in southwest Jamaica taken in 2008-2019. METHODS: Blood spots, collected from the umbilical cord, were analysed by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) to reveal phenotypes for HbSS and HbCC, but genotype confirmation may require parental studies or gene sequencing. Such cases that were successfully traced were analysed in this follow-up study. RESULTS: HPLC screening of 121,306 samples detected HbAS in 11,846 (9.8%), HbAC in 4508 (3.7%) and other electrophoretic abnormalities in 1090 babies. Among 101 previously unconfirmed cases, 34/90 (38%) with HPLC evidence of a HbSS phenotype had other genotypes, and 7/11 (64%) with a HbCC phenotype had other genotypes. Syndromes from the interaction of beta thalassaemia occurred in 112 babies (85 with HbS, 27 with HbC) and of genes for hereditary persistence of fetal haemoglobin (HPFH) in 18 (12 with HbS, 6 with HbC). Variants other than HbS and HbC occurred in 270 babies, 16 in combination with either HbS or HbC, and 254 as traits. Most variants are benign even when inherited with HbS, although HbO Arab, HbD Punjab, or Hb Lepore Washington, which occurred in 6 cases, may cause sickle cell disease. CONCLUSIONS: Genes for beta thalassaemia and HPFH are common in western Jamaica and when associated with HbS may present diagnostic challenges in newborns, as HbF and HbA2 have not reached diagnostic levels. Family and DNA studies may be necessary for genotype confirmation.
38321797		Clinicopathologic Study of Sickle Cell-associated Kidney Disease: A Nigerian Experience.BACKGROUND: Improvements in sickle cell disease (SCD) care have resulted in the survival of many patients into adulthood, although this is accompanied by the increased incidence of end-organ damage, including chronic kidney disease (CKD). OBJECTIVES: This study assessed the prevalence, pattern and predictors of renal dysfunction in SCD patients and investigated the associated renal histopathologic changes. METHODS: We evaluated 105 patients with SCD, for proteinuria, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and tubular dysfunction. Renal biopsy was conducted on 22 patients who qualified. Data were analysed using SPSS package version 23. RESULTS: Thirty-seven (35.2%) of the 105 patients had CKD, as defined by an eGFR of 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 and/or proteinuria. The fractional excretion of potassium (FEK) was elevated in all patients, whereas the fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) was elevated in 98.1%. Glomerular filtration rate was negatively correlated with irreversible percentage sickle cell count (r = -0.616, P = 0.0001), FEK (r = -0.448, P = 0.0001) and FENa (r = -0.336, P = 0.004). Age, irreversible percentage sickle cell count, haemoglobin levels and FENa were the major predictors of CKD. The histological pattern in the 22 patients who had biopsies was consistent with mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis 11 (50%), minimal change disease 6 (27.3%), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis 3 (13.6%) and interstitial nephritis 2 (9.1%). CONCLUSIONS: CKD was prevalent in SCD patients, and it was characterised by tubular dysfunction and mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis. The main predictors of CKD were increased age, severity of vaso-occlusive crisis, worsening anaemia and tubular dysfunction.

METHODS: Transcranial doppler ultrasonography (TCD) was done on 232 SCA children, and 21 found with conditional peak systolic blood velocity (PSV) of 200-249 cm/s in internal carotid, middle or anterior cerebral arteries. These were randomized to receive omega-3 fatty acids and potassium thiocyanate with standard treatment of SCA (test group, N = 14), or standard treatment only (control group, N = 7). After 3 months of treatment, PSV was measured again. RESULTS: Right middle cerebral artery PSV was significantly reduced in the test relative to the control groups (p = 0.04). PSV returned to normal in 79% of the test versus 43% of the control group; and increased to abnormal in one member of the control group, but none of the test group. CONCLUSIONS: The pilot data suggest that in SCA, omega-3 fatty acids and potassium thiocyanate might reduce conditional blood velocity to normal, or prevent progression to abnormal values. A larger, randomized, clinical trial is required to further address the current gap in management of conditional TCD blood velocity.
34551184		A systematic review of cases of West African crystalline maculopathy.AIM: West African crystalline maculopathy (WACM) is, reportedly, a rare condition whose aetiology remains unclear. This study aims to describe the epidemiology, summarizing the identified risk factors and clinical characteristics of cases of WACM, with the goal of highlighting presentation patterns and the clinical course of the condition. METHODS: A comprehensive PubMed, Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science, OMIM and Google scholar search of all articles written in English, and non-English language articles with abstract translated to English on WACM was carried out. Only full case reports and series were included. Data reviewed included epidemiology, risk factors, clinical presentations, imaging characteristics, management and prognosis of WACM. Information on the location of the study was also extracted. RESULTS: Ten studies - seven case reports and three case series - comprising of 30 patients were included. The patients were from West, Central and North-east Africa, with all the studies carried out in North America and Europe. The majority of the patients (76.7%) had diabetes mellitus, 80% had a vascular retinopathy (diabetic retinopathy, sickle cell retinopathy, familial exudative vitreoretinopathy and branch retinal vein occlusion) and 50% had macular oedema. There was no report of associated visual impairment or retinal degeneration. Clinical improvement in the number of crystals was documented in two cases with retinal laser photocoagulation for associated vascular retinopathies. Clinical observation was employed by most clinicians. CONCLUSION: West African crystalline retinopathy is a seemingly innocuous condition affecting black or African people, who were also born in Africa. The majority of the patients have a vascular retinopathy. Longitudinal studies, particularly in Africa, may be required to elucidate the aetiology, as well as the long-term prognosis, of the crystals.

35472468		Pediatric Vulvovaginal Graft-Versus-Host Disease: A Retrospective Cohort Study and Literature Review.STUDY OBJECTIVE: To assess genital symptomatology, characterize the findings of genital examination, and describe the incidence and treatment of vulvovaginal graft-versus-host disease (vvGvHD) in girls and adolescents after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). DESIGN: Retrospective cohort. SETTING: Metropolitan-area children's hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Female allogeneic HSCT recipients ages 0 to 22 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Genital symptoms, genital examination, diagnosis, and treatment of vvGvHD. RESULTS: A total of 57 participants were included in the analysis. The median age at the time of HSCT was 10 years (range 4 months-23 years). Most (n = 40, 71%) underwent transplant for a nonmalignant condition, most commonly sickle cell anemia (n = 19, 33%). The median time of onset of GvHD post HSCT was 62 days (IQR = 42 to 151 days). The most common initial site of GvHD was skin (n = 21, 64%), followed by GI tract (n = 10, 30%). Three patients (5%) were diagnosed with vvGvHD. The time of onset of vvGvHD post HSCT ranged from 62 to 1565 days. One patient (33%) was asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. There was no difference in diagnosis of vvGvHD when race (P = 0.15), age at allogeneic HSCT (P = 0.64), nonmalignant vs malignant indication (P = 0.21), source of stem cells (P = 0.25), partial vs full human leukocyte antigens (HLA) donor match (P = 0.34), and GvHD prophylaxis regimen (P = 0.18) were compared. None had isolated vvGvHD. Vulvovaginal GvHD was preceded by skin GvHD in 1 patient, was preceded by lung GvHD in 1 patient, and occurred concurrently with skin GvHD in the third patient. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric vvGvHD can occur within the first 100 days after transplant and can be asymptomatic. Routine gynecologic evaluation post allogeneic HSCT in children and adolescents should include a thorough review of vulvovaginal symptoms and a gynecologic exam for the detection and treatment of vvGvHD.
38418238		Sickle Eye Project: a cross-sectional, non-interventional study of the prevalence of visual impairment due to sickle cell retinopathy and maculopathy in the UK.INTRODUCTION: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the most common genetic disorders in the UK, with over 15 000 people affected. Proliferative sickle cell retinopathy (SCR) is a well-described complication of SCD and can result in significant sight loss, although the prevalence in the UK is not currently known. There are currently no national screening guidelines for SCR, with wide variations in the management of the condition across the UK. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Sickle Eye Project is an epidemiological, cross-sectional, non-interventional study to determine the prevalence of visual impairment due to SCR and/or maculopathy in the UK. Haematologists in at least 16 geographically dispersed hospitals in the UK linked to participating eye clinics will offer study participation to consecutive patients meeting the inclusion criteria attending the sickle cell clinic. The following study procedures will be performed: (a) best corrected visual acuity with habitual correction and pinhole, (b) dilated slit lamp biomicroscopy and funduscopy, (c) optical coherence tomography (OCT), (d) OCT angiography where available, (e) ultrawide fundus photography, (f) National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire-25 and (g) acceptability of retinal screening questionnaire. The primary outcome is the proportion of people with SCD with visual impairment defined as logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution >=0.3 in at least one eye. Secondary outcomes include the prevalence of each stage of SCR and presence of maculopathy by age and genotype; correlation of stage of SCR and maculopathy to severity of SCD; the impact of SCR and presence of maculopathy on vision-related quality of life; and the acceptability to patients of routine retinal imaging for SCR and maculopathy. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was obtained from the South Central-Oxford A Research Ethics Committee (REC 23/SC/0363). Findings will be reported through academic journals in ophthalmology and haematology.
36115611		Impact of sickle cell disease in shoulder arthroplasty: a matched cohort analysis.BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder of abnormal hemoglobin synthesis that is known to cause glenohumeral avascular necrosis (AVN). Little has been published on the use of shoulder arthroplasty (SA) for the treatment of glenohumeral AVN in SCD. We report on the clinical and radiographic results and postoperative complications following SA in the patient cohort. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed identifying 17 primary SAs (9 hemiarthroplasties, 7 anatomic total SAs, and 1 reverse total SA) in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of SCD and a minimum of 2-year follow-up. This cohort was matched (1:2) according to age, sex, body mass index, type of prosthesis, and year of surgery with patients who had undergone hemiarthroplasty or total SA for osteoarthritis (OA) or reverse total SA for cuff tear arthropathy. Outcomes included the visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score, range of motion, and strength measurements in forward elevation (FE), external rotation (ER), and internal rotation (IR). RESULTS: Our cohort included 9 (52.9%) men with a mean age of 43 yr. The average follow-up time was 5.9 yr. In patients with SCD, SA provided significant improvements in VAS pain (9.1-3.8; P < .001), FE (95 -128 ; P < .001), ER (24 -38 ; P < .001), IR score (3.2-5.2; P < .001), FE strength (4.2-4.8; P < .001), ER strength (4.1-4.7; P < .001), IR strength (4.1-4.7; P < .001), and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons scores (48.6-73.5; P < .001). When compared to the matched cohort, the SCD group demonstrated higher preoperative (9.1 vs. 3.8; P < .001) and postoperative VAS scores (3.8 vs. 1.3; P < .001). Other clinical outcomes demonstrated no significant differences. There were 5 (29%) complications, 2 (11.8%) episodes of sickle cell crisis, and 3 (18%) reoperations in the SCD cohort. When compared to the matched cohort, there were no statistical differences with respect to complications (29% vs. 12%; P = .140) or reoperations (18% vs. 12%; P = .387). CONCLUSIONS: SA is an effective treatment modality for glenohumeral AVN in patients with SCD. Patients may expect improvements in pain, function, motion, and strength. However, final postoperative pain relief may be less than those treated with SA without SCD. Unique perioperative management is necessary to mitigate the risk of postoperative sickle cell crises.
33705373		Can subjective pain be inferred from objective physiological data? Evidence from patients with sickle cell disease.Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) experience lifelong struggles with both chronic and acute pain, often requiring medical interventMaion. Pain can be managed with medications, but dosages must balance the goal of pain mitigation against the risks of tolerance, addiction and other adverse effects. Setting appropriate dosages requires knowledge of a patient's subjective pain, but collecting pain reports from patients can be difficult for clinicians and disruptive for patients, and is only possible when patients are awake and communicative. Here we investigate methods for estimating SCD patients' pain levels indirectly using vital signs that are routinely collected and documented in medical records. Using machine learning, we develop both sequential and non-sequential probabilistic models that can be used to infer pain levels or changes in pain from sequences of these physiological measures. We demonstrate that these models outperform null models and that objective physiological data can be used to inform estimates for subjective pain.
36843306		Diaphragm excursion correlates with performance and ventilation on the 6-min walk test in children with sickle cell disease.INTRODUCTION: Diaphragm function may be impaired in children with sickle cell disease (SCD). We hypothesized that diaphragm function is related to performance and ventilation on the 6-min walk test (6MWT). METHODS: Respiratory muscle testing, diaphragm ultrasonography, and the 6MWT with portable gas analysis were performed on children with SCD and age- and sex-matched controls. RESULTS: Fourteen children with SCD were enrolled. Comparisons were made between nine children with SCD (9.89   +- $ pm $   2.93 years) and nine controls (10.33   +- $ pm $   2.35 years). Diaphragm thickness at total lung capacity, thickening fraction, and excursion time during quiet breaths and deep breaths (DB), all normalized by forced vital capacity, were greater in children with SCD (  p < $p lt $  0.05 for all). 6MWT distance was shorter in children with SCD (450.87   +- $ pm $   74.2 m vs. 579.22  +- $ pm $  72.46 m,  p = $p=$  0.01). Tidal volume (   V T  ${V}_{T}$  ), minute ventilation (    V   E  ${ dot{V}}_{E}$  ), and oxygen consumption (    V   O 2   ${ dot{V}}_{{O}_{2}}$  ) were also lower (  p < $p lt $  0.05 for all). DB excursion correlated positively with 6MWT distance (  r = $r=$  0.648,  p = $p=$  0.023) and negatively with rate of perceived exertion (RPE) (  r = $r=$  -0.759,  p = $p=$  0.003). RPE correlated negatively with distance (  r = $r=$  -0.680,  p = $p=$  0.015). DB excursion time correlated positively with distance (  r = $r=$  0.611,  p = $p=$  0.035),   V T  ${V}_{T}$  (  r = $r=$  0.770,  p = $p=$  0.009),    V   E  ${ dot{V}}_{E}$  (  r = $r=$  0.736,  p = $p=$  0.015), and    V   O 2   ${ dot{V}}_{{O}_{2}}$  (  r = $r=$  0.751,  p = $p=$  0.012). CONCLUSIONS: Increased diaphragm excursion may be a strategy used to relieve air hunger while longer excursion time may reflect compensations to increase lung recruitment. Further studies are needed to better understand how these mechanisms affect exercise tolerance in children with SCD.

Hydroxyurea (HU) is the only FDA-approved HbF inducer however, additional therapeutics that produce an additive effect in SCD are needed. To this end, development of potent Class I histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) for HbF induction represents a rational molecularly targeted approach. In studies here, we evaluated CT-101, a novel Class I-restricted HDACi, a Largazole derivative, for pharmacodynamics, cytotoxicity, and targeted epigenetic effects. In SCD-derived erythroid progenitors, CT-101 induced HbF expression with additive activity in combination with HU. CT-101 preferentially activated gamma-globin gene transcription, increased acetylated histone H3 levels, and conferred an open chromatin conformation in the gamma-globin promoter. These data indicate CT-101 represents a strong potential candidate as a molecularly targeted inducer of HbF.
37795523		Busulfan-fludarabine- or treosulfan-fludarabine-based conditioning before allogeneic HSCT from matched sibling donors in paediatric patients with sickle cell disease: A study on behalf of the EBMT Paediatric Diseases and Inborn Errors Working Parties.How important is choice of conditioning regimen in allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for sickle cell disease (SCD)? We compared HSCT outcomes by conditioning regimen in paediatric patients with SCD from the EBMT registry. In 2010-2020, 251 patients aged <18 years underwent a first matched sibling donor (MSD) HSCT with conditioning based on busulfan-fludarabine (bu-flu; n = 89) or treosulfan-fludarabine (treo-flu; n = 162). In the bu-flu and treo-flu groups, 51.7% and 99.4% of patients, respectively, received thiotepa. Median follow-up was 2.7 years. Two-year overall survival (OS) was 98.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 90.9-99.8) with bu-flu and 99.3% (95% CI: 95.2-99.9) with treo-flu (p = 0.63). Grade III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) at 100 days was 2.4% (95% CI: 0.4-7.5) and 0.6% (0.1%-3.2%) for bu-flu and treo-flu respectively (p = 0.25). The 2-year incidence of extensive chronic GVHD was 1.5% (95% CI: 0.1-7.3) with bu-flu and 8.0% (95% CI: 4.1-13.3) with treo-flu (p = 0.057). These multinational data confirm the excellent curative capacity of MSD HSCT with myeloablative conditioning. Both conditioning regimens yielded excellent OS, low rates of acute and chronic GVHD, and low rates of graft failure.

33677007	associate|@CHEMICAL_sodium_metabisulfite|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell	Anti-sickling activities of two isolated compounds from the root of Combretum racemosum P. beauv. (Combretaceae).ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Evaluation of plants such as Combretum racemosum with claimed traditional use in the management of sickle cell anaemia in Nigeria and other parts of West Africa could serve as a useful research strategy in the search for potential anti-sickling drugs and templates. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed at evaluating the antisickling potential of C. racemosum by activity-guided purification and isolation of its active constituents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Crude methanol extract of the root of C. racemosum and the fractions obtained by partitioning with chloroform, ethyl acetate, and aqueous were investigated for anti-sickling activity against sodium metabisulphite induced sickling of sickle cell haemoglobin (HbSS). Repeated chromatographic separations were conducted on the most active chloroform fraction to purify and isolate bioactive compounds for further tests for anti-sickling activity. The characterization of the isolated compounds was done by mass spectrometry (FD+MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (1HNMR) spectroscopy. RESULTS: The chloroform fraction (FA) (% sickled erythrocyte ranged from 3.0 to 34.1) exhibited better anti-sickling activity than aqueous (% sickled erythrocyte ranged from 38.9 to 51.5) as well as the crude methanol (% sickled erythrocyte ranged from 19.1 to 30.4). Hence, the phytochemical investigation was focused on the chloroform fraction, which led to the identification of two ellagic acid derivatives (3,3',4'-tri-O-methyl ellagic acid (A) and 3,3'-di-O- methyl ellagic acid (B). The two isolated compounds possessed good, comparable anti-sickling activities with compound A exhibiting a slightly better in vitro activity. CONCLUSION: This paper reports for the first time anti-sickling principles from C. racemosum and therefore, provided some justification for the ethnomedicinal use of the plant in the management of sickle cell disease.
37803527		Natural history of blood pressure in sickle cell disease pregnancy.In this retrospective cohort study of singleton pregnancies in people with sickle cell disease (SCD) delivered at two academic centres between 1990 and 2021, we collected demographic and SCD-related data, pregnancy outcomes, and the highest systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP) at seven time periods. We compared blood pressure values and trajectories in the composite cohort and in each genotype group to control values in a non-SCD pregnancy dataset. There were 290 pregnancies among 197 patients with SCD. Sixteen per cent (n = 47) of pregnancies had a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy (HDP); the rates did not differ by genotype. The mean SBP and DBP were lower in the HbSS/HbSbeta0 group than in the non-SCD control group at all timepoints. Mean SBP and DBP trajectories were similar between the HbSS/HbSbeta0 group and non-SCD controls, whereas the mean SBP and DBP in the HbSC/HbSbeta+ group decreased between the first and second trimesters and plateaued between the second and third trimesters. There were no differences in blood pressure trajectory by haemoglobin >/< 10 gm/dL or by chronic transfusion status. Overall, pregnant people with SCD have lower blood pressure than unaffected pregnant people, raising the possibility that HDP are underdiagnosed, particularly in people with HbSS/HbSbeta0 .
36102140	associate|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell|@GENE_HLA_DRB1	HLA Class II regulation of immune response in sickle cell disease patients: Susceptibility to red blood cell alloimmunization (systematic review and meta-analysis).BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Sickle cell disease (SCD) patients are commonly treated with red blood cell (RBC) transfusion. Pretransfusion tests commonly involve limited serological antibody testing. RBC alloimmunization to RBC antigens is a frequently encountered complication seen in chronically transfused patients. Genetic factors such as the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) are known to influence and regulate immune responses. HLAs are highly polymorphic and play an essential role in regulating immune responses, including RBC alloimmunization. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the association between HLA Class II allelic polymorphisms with the possible risk of developing RBC alloantibodies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four databases were systematically searched for relevant studies between the years 2000 and 2021 following the PRISMA guidelines. Four articles met the eligibility and quality criterion, and three alleles, HLA-DRB1*04, HLA-DRB1*15 and HLA-DQB1*03, that were found to be potentially associated with an increased risk in alloantibody formation were included. RESULTS: The primary outcome measure was alloimmunization by RBC antigen exposure in multiply transfused SCD patients. The total estimate of alloimmunization of the SCD patients was 2.33 (95% CI, 1.58-3.44), demonstrating susceptibility to RBC alloantibody formation. Heterogeneity between the studies was insignificant, suggesting the differences associated with random sampling errors. The results showed that SCD patients carry an increased risk of producing RBC alloantibodies. CONCLUSION: A strategy to prevent RBC alloimmunization is genotyping for genetically susceptible SCD patients receiving multiple transfusions. Early identification of genetic variants that can potentially increase the risk of RBC alloimmunization could aid in the screening process and selection of phenotypically matched RBC units.
35218242		Outcomes of kidney donors with sickle cell trait: A preliminary analysis.Most transplant centers do not screen kidney donor candidates for sickle cell trait (SCT) and many decline candidates with SCT since it may associate with kidney disease. We compared 17 kidney donors with SCT to propensity score matched donor controls on mortality, reduced eGFR, proteinuria and kidney failure. The prevalence of SCT in African American (AA) donors was 11 per 1000 compared to 73 per 1000 in non-donor AA. Donors with SCT were younger; 33 versus 35 years in controls, nine were AA, six were White, and two were listed as other or unknown ethnicities. After a follow-up period of 18.2 +- 10.5 years, the proportions of donors with SCT and controls who were alive, developed hypertension or cardiovascular disease were similar. No donor with SCT developed an eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 or kidney failure. SCT was, however, associated with increased risk of proteinuria; RR 5.71 (95% CI 5.7 - 22.7), P = .01. This small and preliminary case series suggest that donors with SCT should perhaps be considered more often provided they were aware of the lack of evidence to support liberal acceptance and that these outcomes reported here likely represent a healthy cohort of donors with SCT.
37257234		Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in hemoglobinopathies is modified by age and race.Prior literature has established a positive association between sickle cell disease and risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2. Data from a cross-sectional study evaluating COVID-19 testing devices (n = 10,567) was used to examine the association between underlying health conditions and SARS-CoV-2 infection in an urban metropolis in the southern United States. Firth's logistic regression was used to fit the model predicting SARS-CoV-2 positivity using vaccine status and different medical conditions commonly associated with COVID-19. Another model using the same method was built using SARS-CoV-2 positivity as the outcome and hemoglobinopathy presence, age (<16 Years vs. >=16 Years), race/ethnicity and comorbidities, including hemoglobinopathy, as the factors. Our first model showed a significant association between hemoglobinopathy and SARS-CoV-2 infection (OR: 2.28, 95 % CI: (1.17,4.35), P = 0.016). However, in the second model, this association was not maintained (OR: 1.35, 95 % CI: (0.72,2.50), P = 0.344). We conclude that the association between SARS-CoV-2 positivity and presence of hemoglobinopathies like sickle cell disease is confounded by race, age, and comorbidity status. Our results illuminate previous findings by identifying underlying clinical/demographic factors that confound the reported association between hemoglobinopathies and SARS-CoV-2. These findings demonstrate how social determinants of health may influence disease manifestations more than genetics alone.
35018749		Assessing and managing people with sickle cell disease presenting with vaso-occlusive crisis in the emergency department.Sickle cell disease is a group of inherited blood disorders characterised by atypical haemoglobin molecule structures (haemoglobin S) which can manifest as painful vaso-occlusive crises, chronic anaemia and progressive organ damage. This article aims to raise greater awareness of sickle cell disease, its acute manifestations and the potential for rapid clinical deterioration that can occur in patients with this condition. The article outlines the main aspects of the assessment and management of patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with vaso-occlusive crisis, describes the barriers to effective care that they commonly experience and explains how their care could be improved. The authors emphasise the importance of timely management of these patients by ED staff, including emergency nurses.

This has led to the development of the term relative systemic hypertension (RSH). RSH was defined as Systolic BP 120-139 mm Hg or diastolic BP 70-89 mm Hg, whereas systemic hypertension is defined as Systolic BP >= 140 mm Hg or diastolic BP >= 90 mm Hg. Systematic identification of BP variations and risk factors in SCD patients could promote effective management. This review aimed to identify factors associated with BP variation among SCD patients. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar up to December 2020 with no geographical or language restrictions. Two reviewers independently screened and summarized data from eligible studies. RESULTS: Advancing age, gender, higher body weight, hemoglobin, eGFR, triglycerides, greater hematocrit, higher blood viscosity, history of blood transfusion, and targeted variants in DRD2 and MIR4301 genes were independently associated with the risk of hypertension in SCD patients. CONCLUSION: Interventions that consider these risk factors may potentially contribute to lower BP pressure in SCD patients and prevent the development of severe complications.
33779245		For which diseases do broader value elements matter most? An evaluation across 20 ICER evidence reports.BACKGROUND: U.S. value framework developers such as the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) use cost-effectiveness analysis to value new health care technologies. Often, these value assessment frameworks use a health system perspective without fully accounting for societal and broader benefits and costs of an intervention. Although there is ongoing debate about the most appropriate methods for including broader value elements in value assessment, it remains unclear whether the inclusion of these value elements is likely to affect the quantitative estimates of treatment value. OBJECTIVE: To assess variations in the relevance of broader value elements to cost-effectiveness analysis across diseases. METHODS: Thirty-two broader value elements (e.g., caregiver burden, health equity, real option value, productivity) not traditionally included in health technology assessments were identified through a targeted literature review. Evidence reports published by ICER between July 2017 and January 2020 were evaluated to identify which broader value elements were discussed as relevant to each disease in the report text. The study examined whether there were associations among ICER's discussion of broader value elements, rare disease status, treatment cost, estimated treatment cost-effectiveness, and ICER committee voting results for contextual considerations and additional benefits/disadvantages. RESULTS: The most commonly cited broader value element category in the ICER evidence reports was household and leisure (e.g., absenteeism from normal activities and caregiver burden). More value elements were cited for inherited retinal disease (19 elements) and sickle cell disease (18 elements) than for other diseases. Cardiovascular disease and diabetes had the fewest number of value elements cited (7 elements). Rare diseases were more likely to have broader value elements cited compared with nonrare diseases (15.9 vs. 11.5, P < 0.001). Treatments with higher (i.e., less favorable) incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were more likely to have a greater number of broader value elements cited (rho = 0.625, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of broader value elements varied across diseases, with less cost-effective treatments more likely to have a higher number of relevant broader value elements. Inclusion of all relevant value elements in value assessments will more appropriately incentivize innovation and improve allocation of research funding.

36814160		Microalbuminuria and its association with adverse pregnancy outcome in a tertiary health centre in Nigeria.Background: Adverse pregnancy outcomes occur more commonly in developing countries and are still prevalent in our sub-region. Microalbuminuria is a marker of endothelial dysfunction and has been proposed as an aetiological factor in the development of some adverse pregnancy outcomes such as pre-eclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and pre-term labour. Aim: The aim is to determine the prevalence of microalbuminuria and its association with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Methods: This was a prospective cross-sectional study with follow-up amongst women in early pregnancy presenting at Usmanu Danfodiyo University Teaching Hospital, Sokoto. Three hundred and thirty women with singleton pregnancy at gestational age <20 weeks, blood pressure <140/90 mmHg, normal fasting blood sugar and normal renal function were recruited. Those with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, sickle cell anaemia were excluded, multiple pregnancies, urinary tract infection or positive dipstick proteinuria at first contact were excluded. They were recruited consecutively and a structured interviewer-administered questionnaire was completed. Single-spot urine analysis for albumin was performed. The women were followed up to the time of delivery and the puerperium and any adverse outcome were documented. Results: The prevalence of microalbuminuria was 58.4%. The maternal and foetal adverse outcomes such as hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, pre-mature rupture of membrane, IUGR, preterm birth and stillbirth occurred more amongst the women with microalbuminuria. However, there was no statistically significant association between microalbuminuria and having these adverse outcomes (P > 0.05). Conclusion: There was a high prevalence of microalbuminuria amongst healthy pregnant women and pregnancy complications occurred more frequently in women with microalbuminuria than in those without. However, this association was not sufficient to predict adverse outcomes in pregnancy.
33823382	treat|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell	Single laser trapping for optical folding and rotation of red blood cells in sickle cell disease in response to hydroxyurea treatment.Optical folding and rotation behavior of red blood cells (RBCs) in polarized laser tweezers are considerably important for understanding the biophysical and biomechanical properties using the fast probing method. Here, a dual-mode polarized single-laser tweezers technique with distinct principal axes exhibiting different polarization states is presented and designed to investigate the deformation, optical folding, and rotation of single living cells with one measurement. RBC optical folding and rotation speed are measured in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), including follow up of patients after hydroxyurea (HU) treatment for at least three months. Folding angle and rotation speed are significantly lower in patients with SCD and do not significantly differ in patients treated by HU compared with the healthy control group. The RBC folding angle and rotation speed in patients treated with HU drug increase linearly at lower laser powers and rapidly at higher powers, and increase much slowly in patients not treated with HU. The difference in the folding angle and rotation speed of RBCs could be useful for drug response in SCD or predicting pain crisis in SCD.

Pre-donation genetic testing is recommended in evaluation guidelines and regulatory policy. Collaborating across several institutions, we describe cases to illustrate the utility as well as practical issues in incorporating genetic testing in transplant protocols. Case 1 is from 2009, before pervasive genetic testing. A healthy 27-year-old Caucasian male had an uneventful donor evaluation for his mother, who had early onset ESKD of unclear cause. He participated in paired-exchange kidney donation, but developed progressive kidney disease and gout over the next 10 years. A uromodulin gene mutation (NM_003361.3(UMOD):c.377 G>A p.C126Y) was detected and kidney biopsy showed tubulointerstitial kidney disease. The patient subsequently required kidney transplantation himself. Case 2 was a 36-year-old African American female who had an uneventful kidney donor evaluation. She underwent gene panel-based testing to rule out ApolipoproteinL1 risk variants, for which was negative. Incidentally, a sickle-cell trait (NM_000518.5(HBB):c.20A>T p.Glu7Val) was noted, and she was declined for kidney donation. This led to significant patient anguish. Case 3 was a 26-year-old Caucasian female who underwent panel-based testing because the potential recipient, her cousin, carried a variant of uncertain significance in the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1-beta (HNF1B) gene. While the potential donor did not harbor this variant, she was found to have a likely pathogenic variant in complement factor I (NM_000204.4(CFI):c.1311dup:p.Asp438Argfs*8), precluding kidney donation. Our cases emphasize that while genetic testing can be invaluable in donor evaluation, transplant centers should utilize detailed informed consent, develop care pathways for secondary genetic findings, and share experience to develop best practices around genetic testing in donors.

Although curative allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants (allo-HSCT) were also available, only very few patients underwent the procedure due to lack of matched-related donors. However, therapeutic options for SCD patients increased dramatically in the last few years. Three new agents, l-glutamine, crizanlizumab, and voxelotor, were approved by the FDA for use in SCD patients. The number of SCD patients who underwent allo-HSCT also increased as a result of advances in the prevention of graft failure and graft-versus-host disease from using mismatched donor HSC. More recently gene therapy was made available on clinical trials. The increased treatment options for SCD have led to a sense of optimism and excitement among many physicians that these new approaches would alter the clinical course and disease burden. Although these newer agents do provide hope to SCD patients, the hyped-up responses need to be evaluated in the context of reality. In this review, we will discuss and compare these new agents and cell-based therapy, evaluate their clinical and economic impacts, and examine their roles in reducing the disease burden.

Although numerous genetic variants have been identified as contributors to QT interval prolongation in the general population, their impact on SCD patients remains unclear. This study used an unweighted polygenic risk score (PRS) to validate the previously identified associations between SNPs and QTc interval in SCD patients, and to explore possible interactions with other factors that prolong QTc interval in AA individuals with SCD. METHODS: In SCD patients, candidate genetic variants associated with the QTc interval were genotyped. To identify any risk SNPs that may be correlated with QTc interval prolongation, linear regression was employed, and an unweighted PRS was subsequently constructed. The effect of PRS on the QTc interval was evaluated using linear regression, while stratification analysis was used to assess the influence of serum alanine transaminase (ALT), a biomarker for liver disease, on the PRS effect. We also evaluated the PRS with the two subcomponents of QTc, the QRS and JTc intervals. RESULTS: Out of 26 candidate SNPs, five risk SNPs were identified for QTc duration under the recessive model. For every unit increase in PRS, the QTc interval prolonged by 4.0ms (95% CI: [2.0, 6.1]; p-value: <0.001) in the additive model and 9.4ms in the recessive model (95% CI: [4.6, 14.1]; p-value: <0.001). Serum ALT showed a modification effect on PRS-QTc prolongation under the recessive model. In the normal ALT group, each PRS unit increased QTc interval by 11.7ms (95% CI: [6.3, 17.1]; p-value: 2.60E-5), whereas this effect was not observed in the elevated ALT group (0.9ms; 95% CI: [-7.0, 8.8]; p-value: 0.823). CONCLUSION: Several candidate genetic variants are associated with QTc interval prolongation in SCD patients, and serum ALT acts as a modifying factor. The association of a CPS1 gene variant in both QTc and JTc duration adds to NOS1AP as evidence of involvement of the urea cycle and nitric oxide metabolism in cardiac repolarization in SCD. Larger replication studies are needed to confirm these findings and elucidate the underlying mechanisms.
38165013		Cerebrovascular and cardiovascular autonomic regulation in sickle cell patients with white matter lesions.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: White matter lesions (WMLs) are frequent in sickle cell disease (SCD), with a prevalence described to be as high as 53% by age 30. Cerebrovascular regulation and cardiovascular autonomic regulation, more specifically the sympatho-vagal balance, can be altered in SCD. In this study the association between WMLs, cerebrovascular regulation and sympatho-vagal balance was assessed in SCD patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: Sickle cell disease patients with no history of stroke were prospectively evaluated for cerebrovascular reactivity using the breath-holding test (BHT), the sympatho-vagal balance (ratio low frequency/high frequency [HF]) using heart rate variability parameters and cerebral autoregulation in the time domain using correlation index Mx, and arterial cerebral compliance based on continuous assessment of cerebral blood flow velocities using transcranial Doppler ultrasound and arterial blood pressure with photo-plethysmography. WMLs were assessed with magnetic resonance imaging using Fazekas score grading and the presence of lacunes. Forty-one patients (F/M 25/16) were included. Median age was 37.5 years (19-65). Twenty-nine (70.7%) patients had SS genotype. Eleven patients had WMLs (26.8%). Patients with WMLs were significantly older (p < 0.001), had a lower HF (p < 0.005) and an impaired cerebral arterial compliance (p < 0.014). The receiver operating curve for the regression model including age and HF showed a higher area under the curve compared to age alone (0.946 vs. 0.876). BHT and Mx did not significantly differ between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Lower parasympathetic activity and impaired cerebral arterial compliance were associated with WMLs in adults with SCD. This could potentially yield to a better understanding of pathophysiological parameters leading to premature cerebrovascular ageing in SCD.

35320237		Perspective on newborn screening (NBS): Evidence sharing on conditions to be included in NBS in Pakistan.Newborn screening aims at detecting treatable disorders early so that the treatment can be initiated to prevent mortality and morbidity. Such programmes are well established in most developed countries, and all newborns are screened for selected metabolic, endocrine and other disorders based on disease epidemiology, testing and treatment availability, efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Even in developing countries, such screening programmes are initiated using heel prick capillary blood collected on filter paper. The current narrative review was planned to provide a perspective with evidence in favour of starting newborn screening for different disorders. The programme project should be initiated nationwide, taking one disorder, congenital hypothyroidism, as the prototype and a newborn screening panel can then be extended to include other disorders. A task force should be set up to recommend disorders to be included in the panel, develop the national plan policies, and define procedures to strengthen the testing.

34030733		Clinical features and prognostic factors of intensive and non-intensive 1014 COVID-19 patients: an experience cohort from Alahsa, Saudi Arabia.BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a worldwide pandemic and has placed significant demand for acute and critical care services on hospitals in many countries. OBJECTIVES: To determine the predictors of severe COVID-19 disease requiring admission to an ICU by comparing patients who were ICU admitted to non-ICU groups. METHODS: A cohort study was conducted for the laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients who were admitted to six Saudi Ministry of Health's hospitals in Alahsa, between March 1, 2020, and July 30, 2020, by reviewing patient's medical records retrospectively. RESULTS: This cohort included 1014 patients with an overall mean age of 47.2 +- 19.3 years and 582 (57%) were males. A total of 205 (20%) of the hospitalized patients were admitted to the ICU. Hypertension, diabetes and obesity were the most common comorbidities in all study patients (27.2, 19.9, and 9%, respectively). The most prevalent symptoms were cough (47.7%), shortness of breath (35.7%) and fever (34.3%). Compared with non-ICU group, ICU patients had older age (p <= 0.0005) and comprised a higher proportion of the current smokers and had higher respiratory rates (p <= 0.0005), and more percentage of body temperatures in the range of 37.3-38.0  C (p >= 0.0005); and had more comorbidities including diabetes (p <= 0.0005), hypertension (p >= 0.0005), obesity (p = 0.048), and sickle cell disease (p = 0.039). There were significant differences between the non-ICU and ICU groups for fever, shortness of breath, cough, fatigue, vomiting, dizziness; elevated white blood cells, neutrophils, alanine aminotransferase and alkaline aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, and ferritin, and decreased hemoglobin; and proportion of abnormal bilateral chest CT images (p < 0.05). Significant differences were also found for multiple treatments (p < 0.05). ICU patients group had a much higher mortality rate than those with non-ICU admission (p <= 0.0005). CONCLUSION: Identifying key clinical characteristics of COVID-19 that predict ICU admission and high mortality can be useful for frontline healthcare providers in making the right clinical decision under time-sensitive and resource-constricted environment.
35059711		Standardizing Opioid Prescribing in a Pediatric Hospital: A Quality Improvement Effort.BACKGROUND: Opioids are indicated for moderate-to-severe pain caused by trauma, ischemia, surgery, cancer and sickle cell disease, and vaso-occlusive episodes (SCD-VOC). There is only limited evidence regarding the appropriate number of doses to prescribe for specific indications. Therefore, we developed and implemented an opioid prescribing algorithm with dosing guidelines for specific procedures and conditions. We aimed to reach and sustain 90% compliance within 1 year of implementation. METHODS: We conducted this quality improvement effort at a pediatric academic quaternary care institution. In 2018, a multidisciplinary team identified the need for a standard approach to opioid prescribing. The algorithm guides prescribers to evaluate the medical history, physical examination, red flags, pain type, and to initiate opioid-sparing interventions before prescribing opioids. Opioid prescriptions written between January 2015 and September 2020 were included. Examples from 2 hospital departments will be highlighted. Control charts for compliance with guidelines and variability in the doses prescribed are presented for selected procedures and conditions. RESULTS: Over 5 years, 83 037 opioid prescriptions in 53 804 unique patients were entered electronically. The encounters with >=1 opioid prescription decreased from 48% to 25% between 2015 and 2019. Compliance with the specific guidelines increased to ~85% for periacetabular osteotomies and SCD-VOC and close to 100% for anterior-cruciate ligament surgery. In all 3 procedures and conditions, variability in the number of doses prescribed decreased significantly. CONCLUSION: We developed an algorithm, guidelines, and a process for improvement. The number of opioid prescriptions and variability in opioid prescribing decreased. Future evaluation of specific initiatives within departments is needed.

35964532		Characteristics and outcomes of stroke hospitalizations in patients with sickle cell disease and moyamoya syndrome.OBJECTIVES: Stroke is the leading cause of death in patients with Sickle cell disease (SCD). Here, we detail the burden of Moyamoya syndrome (MMS) as a cause of stroke in patients with SCD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A review of SCD-related hospital discharges was conducted utilizing the National Inpatient Sample. Rates of stroke hospitalization, risk factors, procedures, and outcomes were compared between patients with SCD-MMS and SCD alone. Univariate analyses including T-test, Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test, Chi-square were performed to compare risk factors and outcomes. Multivariable regression was used to identify predictors of stroke unique to each population. RESULTS: Stroke occurred in 9.8% of SCD-MMS hospitalizations versus 0.5% of those involving patients with SCD alone (OR = 20.71, p < 0.001). Patients with SCD-MMS developed stroke at younger ages and with fewer comorbidities compared to those with SCD alone. Stroke hospitalizations in SCD-MMS involved a greater number of procedures (90.5% vs. 79.3%, p = 0.007), but were more likely to result in favorable discharge (58.5% vs. 44.2%, p = 0.005). The presence of anemia during hospitalization was a significant risk factor for stroke in both cohorts. Long-term antiplatelet use was protective against stroke (OR = 0.42, p = 0.008) only in the SCD-MMS cohort. CONCLUSIONS: MMS confers a 20-fold increased risk of stroke among patients with SCD and appears to be an important cause of recurrent stroke in this population. Anemia is one of the most significant risk factors for stroke, while antiplatelet use appears to confer a protective benefit.
34090800		Topical Vapocoolant-Associated Vaso-occlusive Event in a 10-year-old with Sickle Cell Disease.Vapocoolant sprays are convenient forms of cold temperature analgesia. These sprays may not be suitable for all patients with particular concern for patients with sickle cell disease. To prevent any further cases from occurring, we propose adding a more specific cautionary statement to the manufacturer guidelines. We also hope that medical personnel can help patients with sickle cell avoid topical and environmental cold temperature triggers for sickle vaso-occlusive pain and reduce the suffering in this rare disease.
34131893		Impact of pre-eclampsia on renal outcome in sickle cell disease patients.The long-term consequences of pre-eclampsia (PrE) for renal function have never been determined in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Between 2008 and 2015, we screened 306 pregnancies in women with SCD and identified 40 with PrE (13%). The control group consisted of 65 pregnant SCD patients without PrE. In multivariable analysis, PrE events were associated with an increase of 1 log of lactate dehydrogenase level (adjusted odds ratio, aOR = 3 83, P = 0 05), a decrease of 10 g/l of haemoglobin levels (aOR = 2 48, P = 0 006) and one or more vaso-occlusive crisis during pregnancy (aOR = 16 68, P = 0 002). Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was similar in the two groups at steady state but was significantly lower in the PrE group after one year of follow-up and at last follow-up (130 vs 148 ml/min/1 73 m2 , P < 0 001 and 120 vs 130 ml/min/1 73 m2 , P < 0 001, respectively). In multivariable analysis, eGFR had returned to steady-state levels one year after pregnancy in patients without PrE but continued to decrease in patients with PrE (beta = -18 15 ml/min/1 73 m2 , P < 0 001). This decline was more marked at the end of follow-up (beta = -31 15 ml/min, P < 0 001). In conclusion, PrE episodes are associated with a significant risk of subsequent renal function decline in SCD patients.

The transcriptional activation of the beta-globin gene is under the control of proximal and distal regulatory elements located on chromosome 11p15.4, including the beta-globin locus control region (LCR). The incorporation of selected LCR elements in lentiviral vectors encoding beta and beta-like globin genes has enabled successful genetic treatment of the beta-thalassemias and sickle cell disease. However, recent occurrences of benign clonal expansions in thalassemic patients and myelodysplastic syndrome in patients with sickle cell disease call attention to the non-erythroid functions of these powerful vectors. Here we demonstrate that lentivirally encoded LCR elements, in particular HS1 and HS2, can be activated in early hematopoietic cells including hematopoietic stem cells and myeloid progenitors. This activity is position-dependent and results in the transcriptional activation of a nearby reporter gene in these progenitor cell populations. We further show that flanking a globin vector with an insulator can effectively restrain this non-erythroid activity without impairing therapeutic globin expression. Globin lentiviral vectors harboring powerful LCR HS elements may thus expose to the risk of trans-activating cancer-related genes, which can be mitigated by a suitable insulator.
33883766		Sickle cell anaemia in vaso-occlusive crisis and acute fatty liver of pregnancy: a case report.Acute fatty liver of pregnancy (AFLP) is an uncommon condition that manifests in the third trimester of pregnancy. Its association with vaso-occlusive crisis from Sickle Cell Anaemia is not common. Published data on the simultaneous occurrence of these two conditions is rare, hence this case report. A 32-year-old gravida 3 para 1+1 lady, with Sickle Cell Anaemia, had a vaso-occlusive crisis in association with AFLP at 32 weeks' gestation, and the outcome of her management was successful. AFLP is a rare late-gestational event affecting about 1 in 10,000 to 15,000 pregnancies. The exact aetiology is not known. Profound hypoglycaemia and jaundice with elevated serum transaminases are recognized features of AFLP. These features may also be seen in haemoglobinopathies. The simultaneous occurrence of AFLP and Sickle Cell Anaemia may result in overlap of symptoms and delay in diagnosis and treatment. Therefore, maintaining a high index of suspicion is key. The cornerstone for treatment remains prompt delivery and supportive care. AFLP can coexist with Sickle cell crises. It is important that care providers, especially in populations with high burden of Sickle Cell Anaemia, consider this as a differential diagnosis, especially when the jaundice is associated with profound or recurring episodes of hypoglycaemia. Prompt diagnosis and delivery in a multidisciplinary approach is important to avoid adverse maternal and foetal outcomes. FUNDING: No funding sources.
35781614	associate|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell|@GENE_TGFBR3	Does TGFBR3 Polymorphism Increase the Risk of Silent Cerebral Infarction in Egyptian Children with Sickle Cell Disease?OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the relationship between TGFBR3 rs284875 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) state and silent cerebral infarction (SCI) in asymptomatic patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 50 children with SCD above 2 y of age followed up at the hematology outpatient clinic of Alexandria University Children's Hospital in Egypt. Twenty-four healthy children were included as a control group. All patients included in the study were subjected to complete history and clinical examination. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed on patients and controls for identification of SNP rs284875 of the TGFBR3 gene. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain were performed only on patients for detection of SCI. RESULTS: Fifty SCD patients were enrolled (26 males and 24 females), with a median age of 10.9 y (2.3-17.8 y), and 24 children as healthy control for the studied SNP. Thirty-five (70%) patients had homozygous SCD, while 30% had sickle beta-thalassemia. The brain MRI was normal in all the patients except for 2 patients who had features of SCI. The TGFBR3 rs284875 SNP was detected in 15 (30%) patients in the homozygous state (GG) versus only 1 (4.2%) child from the control group (p = 0.003). The prevalence of SCI was low in the study population and there was no statistically significant relationship between the TGFBR3 rs284875 SNP status and the presence of SCI in the brain MRI (p = 0.621). CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed a low prevalence of SCI in the SCD patient included in the study. The TGFBR3 rs284875 SNP did not significantly increase SCI among those patients.
34232993		Gene therapy for sickle cell disease: moving from the bench to the bedside.Gene therapy as a potential cure for sickle cell disease (SCD) has long been pursued, given that this hemoglobin (Hb) disorder results from a single point mutation. Advances in genomic sequencing have increased the understanding of Hb regulation, and discoveries of molecular tools for genome modification of hematopoietic stem cells have made gene therapy for SCD possible. Gene-addition strategies using gene transfer vectors have been optimized over the past few decades to increase expression of normal or antisickling globins as strategies to ameliorate SCD. Many hurdles had to be addressed before clinical translation, including collecting sufficient stem cells for gene modification, increasing expression of transferred genes to a therapeutic level, and conditioning patients in a safe manner that enabled adequate engraftment of gene-modified cells. The discovery of genome editors that make precise modifications has further advanced the safety and efficacy of gene therapy, and a rapid movement to clinical trial has undoubtedly been supported by lessons learned from optimizing gene-addition strategies. Current gene therapies being tested in clinical trial require significant infrastructure and expertise, given that cells must be harvested from and chemotherapy administered to patients who often have significant organ dysfunction and that gene-modification takes place ex vivo in specialized facilities. For these therapies to realize their full potential, they would have to be portable, safe, and efficient, to make an in vivo-based approach attractive. In addition, adequate resources for SCD screening and access to standardized care are critically important for gene therapy to be a viable treatment option for SCD.
36172983		Comprehensive guide to managing a chronic automated red cell exchange program in sickle cell disease.Sickle cell disease (SCD) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and limits both the quality and quantity of life. Transfusion therapy, specifically automated red cell exchange (aRCE), plays a key role in management of SCD and is beneficial for certain indications in the chronic, outpatient setting. The approach to maintain a successful chronic aRCE program for SCD is multifaceted. This review will highlight important considerations including indications for aRCE, patient selection, transfusion medicine pearls, vascular access needs, complications of therapy, aRCE prescription, and therapy optimization. Moreover, the importance of a multidisciplinary approach with frequent communication between the services involved cannot be overstated. Ultimately, the underlying goal of a chronic RCE program is to improve the quality of life and longevity of patients with SCD.
34772678		Coma secondary to cerebral fat embolism syndrome due to sickle cell disease fully recovering following red cell exchange transfusion.A 51-year-old woman known for sickle cell disease presented with 2 weeks of headache and bilateral lower limb pain. During admission, she suffered from multiple generalised tonic-clonic seizures but had an unremarkable CT of the brain. Incidentally, she had worsening baseline renal function. She was admitted to the intensive care unit with an acute confusional state. A bedside electroencephalogram showed triphasic waves and diffuse slow activity suggestive of encephalopathy with no epileptiform discharges. She remained obtunded despite appropriate medical therapy of hydration, antiepileptic and pain control. Lumbar puncture failed to identify an infectious cause. An urgent MRI of the brain was done and revealed features compatible with fat embolism syndrome (FES). Her haemoglobin S was 84.2%. Urgent red cell exchange transfusion was done, and within 3 days she fully regained her orientation and motor function. This represents the first case of such profound obtundation due to FES with a complete response to exchange transfusion.
34632580		Extended phenotyping does not preclude the occurrence of delayed haemolytic transfusion reactions in sickle cell disease.Delayed haemolytic transfusion reaction (DHTR) is a potentially life-threatening complication of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in sickle cell disease (SCD) and is classically induced by reactivation of previously formed antibodies. Improved antigenic matching has reduced alloimmunization and may reduce DHTR risk. We conducted a retrospective cohort study to investigate the incidence rate of DHTR in SCD patients receiving extended matched units (ABO/RhDCcEe/K/Fya /Jkb /S). Occasional transfusion episodes (OTE) between 2011 and 2020 were reviewed for occurrence of DHTR symptoms using four screening criteria: decreased Hb, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), pain, and dark urine. We included 205 patients who received a cumulative number of 580 transfusion episodes of 1866 RBC units. During follow-up, 10 DHTR events were observed. The incidence rate of DHTR was 13 8/1000 OTEs [95% confidence interval (CI): 7 37-22 2], with a cumulative incidence of 15 2% (95% CI: 8 4-24 0%) after 25 patients having received RBC units. One DHTR event was fatal (10%). Symptoms were misdiagnosed in four DHTR events (40%) as other acute SCD complications. Despite a lower incidence rate compared to most other studies, the incidence rate of DHTR in SCD remains high, in spite of extended matching of donor RBCs. Increased awareness of DHTR is of utmost importance to facilitate early diagnosis and, consequently, improve outcome.
35856776	cause|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Isotretinoin_embryopathy_like_syndrome	Pediatric hematology providers' contraceptive practices for female adolescents and young adults with sickle cell disease: A national survey.BACKGROUND: Adolescent and young adult (AYA) women with sickle cell disease (SCD) have increased pregnancy-related health risks and are prescribed potentially teratogenic medications, yet limited data are available regarding pediatric SCD provider contraceptive practices. We aimed to assess pediatric hematology providers' beliefs, practices, motivators, and barriers for providing contraceptive care to female AYAs with SCD. METHODS: Guided by the Health Belief Model (HBM), we developed a 25-question, web-based survey to assess practices. Survey links were distributed nationwide to pediatric SCD and/or general hematology providers through their publicly available emails and by request to directors of U.S.-accredited Pediatric Hematology-Oncology fellowship programs for distribution to their SCD providers. Data analysis included descriptive statistics, chi-square analysis, and logistic regression. RESULTS: Of 177 respondents, 160 surveys meeting inclusion criteria were analyzed. Most providers reported counseling (77.5%) and referring female AYA patients for contraception (90.8%), but fewer reported prescribing contraception (41.8%). Proportionally fewer trainees provided counseling compared with established providers (54% vs. 85%, p < .001), with a similar trend for prescribing (p = .05). Prescription practices did not differ significantly by provider beliefs regarding potential teratogenicity of hydroxyurea. Key motivators included patient request and disclosure of sexual activity. Key barriers included inadequate provider training, limited visit time, and perceived patient/parent interest. CONCLUSION: Provider contraceptive practices for female AYAs with SCD varied, especially by provider status. Health beliefs regarding teratogenic potential of hydroxyurea did not correlate with contraceptive practices. Clinical guidelines, provider training, and patient/parent decision-making tools may be tested to assess whether provider contraceptive practices could be improved.
34080441		Acupuncture for chronic pain in adults with sickle cell disease: a mixed-methods pilot study.OBJECTIVE: Chronic pain is a common symptom experienced among patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Our aims were to assess the feasibility and acceptability of performing acupuncture for the treatment of chronic pain in adults with SCD. METHODS: This was a single-arm, prospective pilot study of six adults with SCD. Participants reported >= 3 months of chronic pain and were > 18 years of age. Per protocol, acupuncture was to be administered twice per week for 5 weeks, for 30 min per session. All treatments were performed in the acupuncture treatment laboratory at the University of Illinois Chicago College of Nursing. Pain intensity, pain interference, and other symptoms were measured at baseline and after the intervention. Participants completed a semi-structured interview and a protocol acceptability questionnaire after the acupuncture intervention. RESULTS: Six participants (mean age 52.5 years, six Black) were enrolled. Although the study was suspended due to COVID-19 and not all participants completed the 10-session protocol, completion rates were high with no missed appointments. One participant did not complete the study due to hospitalization unrelated to acupuncture. No adverse events were reported. At completion of the intervention at 4-5 weeks post-baseline, all participants had reduced pain intensity and pain interference. The mean acceptability score on the protocol acceptability questionnaire was 82%. CONCLUSION: It was feasible and acceptable to implement acupuncture in adults with SCD. This study can be used to guide a larger randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of acupuncture on reducing chronic pain in adults with SCD.Trial registration number: NCT04156399 (ClinicalTrials.gov).

Here, we used whole-genome sequencing to track hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from six patients with SCD at pre- and post-GT time points to map the somatic mutation and clonal landscape of gene-modified and unmodified HSCs. Pre-GT, phylogenetic trees were highly polyclonal and mutation burdens per cell were elevated in some, but not all, patients. Post-GT, no clonal expansions were identified among gene-modified or unmodified cells; however, an increased frequency of potential driver mutations associated with myeloid neoplasms or clonal hematopoiesis (DNMT3A- and EZH2-mutated clones in particular) was observed in both genetically modified and unmodified cells, suggesting positive selection of mutant clones during GT. This work sheds light on HSC clonal dynamics and the mutational landscape after GT in SCD, highlighting the enhanced fitness of some HSCs harboring pre-existing driver mutations. Future studies should define the long-term fate of mutant clones, including any contribution to expansions associated with myeloid neoplasms.
35175224		The hematopoietic saga of clonality in sickle cell disease.Sickle cell disease (SCD) is associated with an increased risk of vascular-occlusive events and of leukemia. Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) may increase both risks. In turn, physiologic abnormalities in SCD may modify the incidence and/or distribution of genetic alterations in CH. In a recent issue of the JCI, Liggett et al. found no difference in CH rate between individuals with versus without SCD. Here we contextualize this report and discuss the complex interplay between CH and SCD with particular attention to consequences for emerging gene therapies. We further consider the limitations in our current understanding of these topics that must be addressed in order to optimize therapeutic strategies for SCD.
36781119	cause|@CHEMICAL_Iodine|@DISEASE_Brain_Diseases	Preventive treatment of unruptured intracranial aneurysms in adult patients with sickle cell anemia: A cohort study.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Intracranial aneurysms are frequent in patients with sickle cell anemia, while subarachnoid hemorrhage is a major cause of death and disability in young adult patients. Several characteristics, such as younger age and smaller size at rupture, may incline therapeutic decision towards exclusion treatments. Clinical guidelines on treatment of unruptured intracranial aneurysms in this population are still missing. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of the treatment of unruptured intracranial aneurysm in patients with sickle cell anemia, using an adapted hematological preparation regimen. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Adult patients with sickle cell anemia and treated unruptured aneurysms by endovascular therapy or neurosurgery were included in this retrospective cohort study. Treatment decision was reached after multi-disciplinary assessment. A pre-operative blood transfusion protocol was undertaken targeting a HbS below 30%. Demographic data, hematological preparation parameters and clinical and radiological outcomes were documented. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Twenty-five procedures were performed in 18 patients encompassing 19 aneurysms treated by embolization and 6 by surgery. Median age at treatment was 34 years-old and median aneurysm dome size was 4.4 mm. Immediate aneurysm exclusion rate was 85.7% after endovascular therapy and 100% after neurosurgery. Median follow-up was 6 months, with all patients being asymptomatic at last follow-up. Two transitory ischemic neurological deficits, as well as four cases of iodine-induced encephalopathy were identified after embolization. No complication occurred after surgery. Endovascular therapy by coiling and neurosurgical treatment of unruptured intracranial aneurysms appears to be safe in patients with sickle cell anemia and should be considered given the specific hemorrhagic risk observed in this population. A rigorous hematological preparation, associated with a dedicated peri-operative protocol and an adequate therapeutic strategy are essential prerequisites.
38506484		Using the daily rate of rise in hemoglobin S to manage RBC depletion/exchange treatment in sickle cell disease.BACKGROUND: Red blood cell exchange is often used prophylactically in patients with sickle cell disease, with the goal to maintain hemoglobin S (HbS) below a target threshold level. We reviewed whether the daily "rate of rise" (RoR) in HbS that occurs between procedures can be used for patient management. For some patients not achieving their HbS goals despite efficient exchanges, the post-procedure hematocrit (Hct) target is increased to potentially suppress HbS production. This case series explores the utility of this approach, other clinical uses of the daily RoR in HbS, and the factors that influence it. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 660 procedures from 24 patients undergoing prophylactic RBC depletion/exchange procedures were included. Laboratory values and clinical parameters were collected and used to calculate the daily RoR in HbS. Factors such as Hct or medications that might influence the RoR in HbS were evaluated. RESULTS: The RoR in HbS varied widely between patients but remained relatively stable within individuals. Surprisingly, this value was not significantly influenced by changes in post-procedure Hct or concurrent hydroxyurea use. A patient's average RoR in HbS effectively predicted the pre-procedure HbS at the following visit (R2  = 0.65). DISCUSSION: The RoR in HbS is a relatively consistent parameter for individual patients that is unaffected by medication use or procedural Hct targets and may be useful in determining intervals between procedures.
37535233		Evaluation of the effect of sickle cell disease on the mandibular bone of children and adolescents by image texture and radiomorphometric analysis.OBJECTIVES: Sickle cell disease (SCD) can cause osteoporotic changes in the jaw bones. In this study, it was aimed to evaluate possible bone changes using fractal analysis (FA) and morphometric analyses in dental panoramic radiographs of children and adolescents diagnosed with both homozygous and heterozygous forms of SCD. METHODS: Sixty-five individuals (33 SCD, 32 controls) aged 6-17 years were included in the study. Four separate areas of interest (ROI) were selected for the right and left sides of all panoramic radiographs, and the FA value of the ROIs was calculated. Mandibular cortical width (MCW), panoramic mandibular index (PMI) and mandibular cortical index (MCI) and were evaluated. Data were statistically analyzed and p < 0.05 was accepted for statistical significance. RESULTS: Fractal values of right and left ROI1 (the center of the mandibular angle.) and ROI4 (the cortical bone), and right ROI2 (the middle of the mandibular ramus) were statistically lower in the case group (p < 0.05). Right ROI2 and ROI4 fractal values of individuals in the case group were lower than those on the left side (p < 0.05). While MCI categories did not differ from the case-control group (p > 0.05), PMI and MCW values were lower in the case group (p < 0.05). All evaluated parameters did not differ according to age and gender (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that SCD affects the mandible. FA, MCW and PMI parameters can be used to detect early osteoporotic changes in the disease.
38285418		Priapism in a Young Adult With Sickle Cell Disease.This article presents a case study focusing on priapism in a patient with sickle cell disease, with repeated emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations. The patient was successfully identified and treated by the ED nurse practitioner (NP) with aspiration of the corpus cavernosum. Priapism is a persistent penile erection that continues for an extended time. There is some argument about what that length of time is, but generally, the consensus is more than 4 hr beyond sexual stimulation or unrelated to sexual stimulation or sexual interest (Bivalacqua et al., 2022). Priapism is a fairly common but underrecognized complication of sickle cell disease. It represents a urological emergency in which timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment are vital to preserving penile tissue and sexual function. The diagnosis is made clinically with a comprehensive history, physical examination, and appropriate laboratory test values. Initial management can be conservative with hydration and analgesics or, if necessary, more invasive with needle aspiration to promote detumescence. Permanent tissue damage or erectile dysfunction can result if priapism is unrecognized, untreated, or not treated immediately. The NP plays an integral role in treating and preventing permanent damage. Patient education should focus on instructions for preventing priapism and managing episodes at home.
37229519		Using an individualized pain management plan for African American adults with sickle cell disease.BACKGROUND: The increased lifespan of individuals having sickle cell disease (SCD) causes an overall increase in hospitalizations and more instances in which pain may not be well controlled. LOCAL PROBLEM: The mainstay treatment for severe pain is opioids and the underlying cause. Laws affecting opioid prescribing, implicit bias, racial inequity, poor research funding, and lack of knowledge contribute to poor patient outcomes. METHOD: Data were collected retrospectively using electronic medical record data from before and after the intervention. INTERVENTION: The individualized pain management plan (IPMP) was initiated in collaboration with the patient, pain nurse practitioner (NP), and hematologist. RESULT: The mean length of stay for the traditional pain management plan (TPMP) was 7.89 days compared with 5.66 days for the IPMP, with a mean difference of 2.23 days, t = 2.278, p = .024 (p < .05). There was a decrease in the admission of the individuals with the IPMP, with 25% readmitted within 30 days of discharge, versus 59.0% who were readmitted using the TPMP. Chi-square showed statistical significance (chi2 = 61.667, p = .000) in using nonpharmacological interventions with the IPMP group. CONCLUSION: The IPMP with a patient-centered approach did improve patient outcomes for African American adults living with SCD.
35917483		Meteorological parameters and hospitalizations of patients with sickle cell anemia: a 20-year retrospective study in Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.To investigate the influence of climate on hospitalizations of sickle cell anemia (SCA) adults and children, we analyzed the health and meteorological parameters from a metropolis (1999-2018). 1462 hospitalizations were coded for SCA patients in crisis (M:F = 715:747) and 1354 hospitalizations for SCA patients without crisis (M:F = 698:656) [age = 22.9 vs 15.2 years and duration of hospitalization (DoH) = 5.7 vs 4.4 days, respectively,]. More hospitalizations were for adults than children in crisis, and for children than adults without crisis. More children and adults were hospitalized in winter andspring than in summer and autumn     Hospitalizations correlated positively with humidity (lag -5), maximum pressure (lag -2), mean pressure (lag -2), and thermal amplitude (lag -2), and negatively with maximum temperature (lag -3). DoH positively correlated with minimum temperature (lag -4). Understanding these complex associations would induce attitudinal/behavioral modifications among patients and their caregivers.
38093478		Blood pressure thresholds for the diagnosis of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy in sickle cell disease.In this retrospective cohort study of singleton pregnancies in people with sickle cell disease (SCD) delivered at two academic centres between 1990 and 2021, we collected demographic and SCD-related data, pregnancy outcomes, and the highest systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP) at seven time periods. We compared the characteristics of subjects with new or worsening proteinuria (NWP) during pregnancy to those without. We then constructed receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to determine the blood pressure (BP) that best identifies those with NWP. The SBP or DBP thresholds which maximized sensitivity and specificity were 120 mmHg SBP (sensitivity: 55.2%, specificity: 73.5%) and 70 mmHg DBP (sensitivity: 27.6%, specificity: 67.7%). The existing BP threshold of 140/90 mmHg lacked sensitivity in both genotype groups (HbSS/HbSbeta0 : SBP = 21% sensitive, DBP = 5.3% sensitive; HbSS/HbSbeta+ : SBP = 10% sensitive, DBP = 0% sensitive). Finally, percent change in SBP, DBP and MAP were all poor tests for identifying NWP. Existing BP thresholds used to diagnose hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are not sensitive for pregnant people with SCD. For this population, lowering the BP threshold that defines HDP may improve identification of those who need increased observation, consideration of early delivery and eclampsia prophylaxis.
35014619		Newborn Screening and Clinical Profile of Children With Sickle Cell Disease in a Tribal Area of Gujarat.OBJECTIVE: To present the result of newborn sickle cell disease (SCD) screening and clinical profile of SCD newborns in a tribal area of Gujarat. METHODS: We screened all newborns of sickle cell trait (SCT) and SCD mothers for SCD using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) within two days of birth at a secondary care hospital in a tribal area in Gujarat from 2014 to 2019. Newborns with SCD were registered under an information technology based platform for hospital-based comprehensive care. Neonates were followed prospectively every 3 months. If they missed the clinic visit, a medical counsellor visited them at home to collect the required information. RESULTS: Out of 2492 newborns screened, 87 (3.5%) were diagnosed with SCD. Among the 67 newborns screened for alpha-thalassemia deletion, 64 (95.4%) of babies had alpha-thalassemia deletion. We recorded total 554 clinic visits over the period of 221.5 person-years. The rates of acute febrile illness, painful crisis, hospitalization and severe anemia were 42.9, 14.9, 14.9 and 4.5 per 100 person-year, respectively. Two deaths were recorded, and 5 babies (5.7%) had severe SCD. CONCLUSION: We found a high prevalence of alpha thalassemia deletion among newborn SCD cohort in tribal area of Gujarat, and 70% babies had atleast one clinical complication on follow-up.
36641840		Conjunctival microcirculation in ocular and systemic microvascular disease.The conjunctival microcirculation is an accessible complex network of micro vessels whose quantitative assessment can reveal microvascular haemodynamic properties. Currently, algorithms for the measurement of conjunctival haemodynamics use either manual or semi-automated systems, which may provide insight into overall conjunctival health, as well as in ocular and systemic disease. These algorithms include functional slit-lamp biomicroscopy, laser doppler flowmetry, optical coherence tomography angiography, orthogonal polarized spectral imaging, computer-assisted intravitral microscopy, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and corneal confocal microscopy. Furthermore, several studies have demonstrated a relationship between conjunctival microcirculatory haemodynamics and many diseases such as dry eye disease, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, hypertension, sepsis, coronary microvascular disease, and sickle cell anaemia. This review aims to describe conjunctival microcirculation, its characteristics, and techniques for its measurement, as well as the association between conjunctival microcirculation and microvascular abnormalities in disease states.

Several genetic modifiers, such as the KLOTHO (KL) gene, have been associated with SCA clinical outcomes. The KL gene and its encoded proteins are implicated in important biological pathways, which affect the disease's pathophysiology, such as expression of adhesion molecules VCAM-1 and ICAM-1, oxidative stress, and nitric oxide biology. Here, we evaluated the clinical relevance of two polymorphisms found on the KL gene (rs685417 and rs211239) in 588 unrelated patients with SCA. Genotyping analyses were performed using the TaqMan system. The KL rs211239 was associated with increased number of vaso-occlusive crisis (VOCs) per year (P = 0.001), while KL rs685417 was associated with increased frequency of stroke (P = 0.034), priapism (P = 0.011), number of complications (P = 0.019), and with a lower incidence of priapism (P = 0.036). Additionally, the associations with VOCs, stroke, and priapism remained consistent in multivariate analyses (P < 0.05). Our data highlight the clinical importance of KL in SCA.
34676938		Imaging Blood-Brain Barrier Permeability Through MRI in Pediatric Sickle Cell Disease: A Feasibility Study.BACKGROUND: Blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption may lead to endothelium dysfunction and inflammation in sickle cell disease (SCD). However, abnormalities of BBB in SCD, especially in pediatric patients for whom contrast agent administration less than optimal, have not been fully characterized. PURPOSE: To examine BBB permeability to water in a group of pediatric SCD participants using a non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging technique. We hypothesized that SCD participants will have increased BBB permeability. STUDY TYPE: Prospective cross-sectional. POPULATION: Twenty-six pediatric participants (10 +- 1 years, 15F/11M) were enrolled, including 21 SCD participants and 5 sickle cell trait (SCT) participants, who were siblings of SCD patients. FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 3 T. Water extraction with phase-contrast arterial spin tagging with echo-planer imaging, phase-contrast and T1 -weighted magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition of gradient echo. ASSESSMENT: Water extraction fraction (E), BBB permeability-surface area product (PS), cerebral blood flow, hematological measures (hemoglobin, hematocrit, hemoglobin S), neuropsychological scores (including domains of intellectual ability, attention and executive function, academic achievement and adaptive function, and a composite score). Regions of interest were drawn by Z.L. (6 years of experience). STATISTICAL TESTS: Wilcoxon rank sum test and chi-square test for group comparison of demographics. Multiple linear regression analysis of PS with diagnostic category (SCD or SCT), hematological measures, and neuropsychological scores. A two-tailed P value of 0.05 or less was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Compared with SCT participants, SCD participants had a significantly higher BBB permeability to water (SCD: 207.0 +- 33.3 mL/100 g/minute, SCT: 171.2 +- 27.2 mL/100 g/minute). SCD participants with typically more severe phenotypes also had a significantly leakier BBB than those with typically milder phenotypes (severe: 217.3 +- 31.7 mL/100 g/minute, mild: 193.3 +- 31.8 mL/100 g/minute). Furthermore, more severe BBB disruption was associated with worse hematological symptoms, including lower hemoglobin concentrations (beta = -8.84, 95% confidence interval [CI] [-14.69, -3.00]), lower hematocrits (beta = -2.96, 95% CI [-4.84, -1.08]), and higher hemoglobin S fraction (beta = 0.77, 95% CI [0.014, 1.53]). DATA CONCLUSION: These findings support a potential role for BBB dysfunction in SCD pathogenesis of ischemic injury. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 2 TECHNICAL EFFICACY: Stage 2.

Genome-editing technologies have the potential to correct the SCD mutation in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), producing adult hemoglobin while simultaneously eliminating sickle hemoglobin. Here, we developed high-efficiency viral vector-free non-footprint gene correction in SCD CD34+ cells with electroporation to deliver SCD mutation-targeting guide RNA, Cas9 endonuclease, and 100-mer single-strand donor DNA encoding intact beta-globin sequence, achieving therapeutic-level gene correction at DNA (~30%) and protein (~80%) levels. Gene-edited SCD CD34+ cells contributed corrected cells 6 months post-xenograft mouse transplant without off-target delta-globin editing. We then developed a rhesus beta-to-betas-globin gene conversion strategy to model HSC-targeted genome editing for SCD and demonstrate the engraftment of gene-edited CD34+ cells 10-12 months post-transplant in rhesus macaques. In summary, gene-corrected CD34+ HSCs are engraftable in xenograft mice and non-human primates. These findings are helpful in designing HSC-targeted gene correction trials.
37391656		Sickle Cell Crises in Pregnancy: Fetal and Neonatal Implications.Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common inherited condition worldwide. In the United States, SCD affects 100,000 births every year, mostly persons of African descent. In SCD, red blood cells assume a sickle shape when deoxygenated. This leads to the occlusion of small blood vessels and decreased oxygenated blood flow, resulting in ischemic and thrombotic injury to various organs, which further leads to organ dysfunction. In pregnancy, patients with SCD are at an increased risk of vaso-occlusive crises, which further increases the risks of maternal, fetal, and neonatal morbidity and mortality.
37092306		Revisiting the benefits of isovolemic hemodilution red cell exchange for sickle cell disease.BACKGROUND: Isovolemic hemodilution red cell exchange (IHD-RCE) is a modified form of the standard red cell exchange (STD-RCE), intended to reduce red cell requirements in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). This retrospective crossover analysis of nine patients aims to add to the limited existing literature on IHD-RCE and address the equipoise regarding whether the benefits of (a) decreased RBC usage per exchange and (b) increased interprocedure interval (via lower fraction of cells remaining, FCR) can be observed at the same time, in the same patient. METHODS: At a single center, we identified 37 patients with SCD undergoing chronic RCE between 2014 and 2021. We excluded those patients who did not have at least six consecutive procedures of each type (STD- and IHD-RCE), arriving at nine patients for analysis. RESULTS: When using greater decreases in hematocrit than previously published, we did not find that IHD-RCE resulted in any clinically apparent adverse events. We did find greater decreases in diastolic blood pressure and increases in heart rate in some patients, as compared to STD-RCE. After correcting for total blood volume, seven of the nine patients had significantly reduced red cell requirements with each IHD-RCE. Because the pattern of achieving a lower FCR than programmed was seen to an equal extent with both IHD-RCE and STD-RCE, none of the nine patients showed any statistical difference in actual FCR between procedure types. DISCUSSION: Our data do not support the observation of both IHD-RCE benefits, decreased red cell usage per exchange and lower FCR/increased interprocedure interval, simultaneously.
33648973		Acute Kidney Injury among Black Patients with Sickle Cell Trait and Sickle Cell Disease.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Sickle cell trait and sickle cell disease are associated with faster GFR decline compared with normal hemoglobin phenotypes. We sought to compare the AKI risk in sickle cell trait/disease to normal hemoglobin phenotypes and investigate the association between AKI and GFR decline in sickle cell trait/disease. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: This multicenter observational study used registry data (January 2005-June 2018) of adult Black patients with sickle cell trait/disease (exposures) and normal hemoglobin phenotype (reference) ascertained by hemoglobin electrophoresis. Outcomes of interest (incident AKI [1.5 times baseline serum creatinine or higher], incident severe AKI [doubling of baseline serum creatinine or higher], and incident sustained AKI [AKI persisting for >=72 hours]) were adjudicated by chart review and evaluated by Cox regression. The association between AKI and GFR decline (linear mixed models) was also investigated. RESULTS: We identified 8968 reference patients, 1279 patients with sickle cell trait, and 254 patients with sickle cell disease with a median follow-up of 7.6 years and mean baseline serum creatinine of 0.8 mg/dl. We observed 796 AKI events, 452 sustained AKI events, and 466 severe AKI events. Compared with people with a normal hemoglobin phenotype, sickle cell trait was associated with higher risk for sustained AKI (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.64; 95% confidence interval, 1.27 to 2.11), but not AKI (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.11; 95% confidence interval, 0.91 to 1.36) or severe AKI (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.26; 95% confidence interval, 0.96 to 1.64). Sickle cell disease was associated with AKI (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.85; 95% confidence interval, 2.13 to 3.81), severe AKI (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.38; 95% confidence interval, 1.65 to 3.42), and sustained AKI (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.50; 95% confidence interval, 1.68 to 3.71). Post-AKI GFR decline was significantly faster in sickle cell trait (0.37 ml/min per 1.73 m2 per year faster, P<0.01) and disease (1.69 ml/min per 1.73 m2 per year faster, P<0.01) compared with the reference. CONCLUSIONS: Sickle cell trait and disease are associated with higher risk of AKI, which is associated with accelerated decline in eGFR.
35072359		Successful use of veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for acute chest syndrome in a child with sickle cell disease and SARS-CoV-2.Children with sickle cell disease (SCD) are at increased risk for severe illness due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We describe the successful native lung recovery of a child with SCD referred for lung transplant (LTx) evaluation who was on prolonged veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO). He initially presented with acute chest syndrome complicated by SARS-CoV-2 infection that ultimately required dual-lumen, single bicaval VV-ECMO cannulation for respiratory support. Despite the increased risk of hemolysis and thrombosis from SCD and SARS-CoV-2 infection, he was successfully supported on VV-ECMO for 71 days without complications leading to native lung recovery with meticulous management of his SCD therapy. This report provides new insight on our approach to VV-ECMO support in a child with SCD and SARS-CoV-2 infection. With a successful outcome, the patient has returned home but still on mechanical ventilation with LTx still an option if he is not eventually liberated from invasive respiratory support.
34274957	treat|@CHEMICAL_Alemtuzumab|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell ;treat|@CHEMICAL_Alemtuzumab|@DISEASE_Graft_vs_Host_Disease	Matched related hematopoietic cell transplant for sickle cell disease with alemtuzumab: the Texas Children's Hospital experience.Serotherapeutic agents facilitate engraftment and prevent graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) following hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Anti-thymocyte globulin is generally added to conditioning chemotherapy for matched related donor transplant (MRD-HCT) for sickle cell disease (SCD). Alemtuzumab, however, is appealing due to its broad lymphocyte killing that may achieve very low rejection and GVHD rates. To assess the impact of alemtuzumab in MRD-HCT for SCD, we retrospectively reviewed transplant-related outcomes and markers of immunity in 38 consecutive patients at Texas Children's Hospital having received myeloablative conditioning with alemtuzumab. Median follow-up was 4.8 years (range: 0.2-17). All patients engrafted. Donor chimerism was mixed in 47.1% of patients at >=2-years. Donor chimerism <50% was uncommon (n = 2). One patient with low myeloid chimerism (19%) had sickle-related hemolysis at 10-years. Incidence of acute GVHD grade II-IV (5.3%) and extensive chronic GVHD (2.8%) was very low. Five-year event-free survival (EFS) and composite chronic GVHD-EFS were excellent at 94.7% (95% CI: 80.3, 98.6) and 89.2% (95% CI: 73.7, 95.8), respectively. Infections did not contribute to mortality although cytomegalovirus reactivation occurred commonly in the first 3 months after transplant. Our data suggest potential for alemtuzumab in myeloablative transplant for children with SCD although further evaluation in older patients and with unrelated donors is warranted.
35094036		Size and density measurements of single sickle red blood cells using microfluidic magnetic levitation.Single cells have unique biophysical signatures that can rapidly change during various disease states. For instance, cellular density is an inherent property differing between cell types. Characterizing changes in fundamental density properties down to the single-cell level can reveal sub-populations in pathological states. Here, we have developed a microfluidic, magnetic levitation-based assay (MagDense) that detects minute density differences of individual red blood cells (RBCs) down to 0.0001 g mL-1 resolution. This assay fractionates RBCs based on their density profiles in a non-ionic paramagnetic medium flowing in a capillary microchannel placed between magnets with same poles facing each other. Based on precisely measured levitation height and density of individual RBCs at their specific equilibrium state, we demonstrated that MagDense can accurately analyze the density of sickle hemoglobin (HbS)-containing RBCs and normal hemoglobin (HbA)-containing RBCs. In addition, the precise density and cell size measurements at the single cell level showed three different sub-populations of RBCs in blood samples from individuals with homozygous sickle cell disease receiving blood transfusions; where less dense, HbA-containing RBCs levitated higher, while the denser, HbS-containing RBCs levitated lower. We compared the mean RBC densities of sickle cell disease subjects with healthy controls and found distinctly separated bands of RBC density for each group denoting the likely range of cell densities seen in the blood samples. The high resolution of our method enabled measurement of deviation from the mean RBC density. Moreover, we introduced a new term as a measure of density dispersion, "RBC levitational density width, RLDW". Mean RBC density in sickle cell disease associated with hemoglobin from complete blood count (p = 0.032, linear regression) and RLDW associated with absolute reticulocyte count (ARC) and RBC distribution width (RDW) from complete blood count (p = 0.002 for ARC and p = 003 for RDW, linear regression). Our magnetic levitation-based assay enables rapid, accurate, density-based imaging, profiling and label-free monitoring of single RBCs. Our approach can be broadly applicable to investigate blood cell disorders and the effects of emerging pharmacological and curative therapies in patient outcomes.
36856299		In Situ Pulmonary Arterial Thrombosis-Literature Review and Clinical Significance of a Distinct Entity.Filling defects identified in the pulmonary arterial tree are commonly presumed to represent an embolic phenomenon originating from thrombi formed in remote veins, particularly lower-extremity deep venous thrombosis (DVT). However, accumulating evidence supports an underappreciated cause for pulmonary arterial thrombosis (PAT), namely, de novo thrombogenesis-where thrombosis arises within the pulmonary arteries in the absence of DVT. Although historically underrecognized, in situ PAT has become of heightened importance with the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In situ PAT is attributed to endothelial dysfunction, systemic inflammation, and acute lung injury, and has been described in a range of conditions including COVID-19, trauma, acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease, pulmonary infections, and severe pulmonary arterial hypertension. The distinction between pulmonary embolus and in situ PAT may have important implications regarding management decisions and clinical outcomes. In this review, we summarize the pathophysiology, imaging appearances, and management of in situ PAT in various clinical situations. This understanding will promote optimal tailored treatment strategies for this increasingly recognized entity.
37326259		Radiological manifestation of avascular necrosis (AVN) in sickle cell disease (SCD): a review of diagnostic imaging.Symptomatic avascular necrosis (AVN) imposes a higher risk for acute care consumption in adults living with SCD. Symptomatic AVN, have higher rates of visits to the emergency department, higher rates of admissions, and longer lengths of stay in hospitals. Properly timed diagnosis and early interventions can reduce morbidity and enhance the quality of life in these patients. Vaso-occlusion secondary to sickling leads to osteonecrosis of the joint/bone (AVN, dactylitis) and invites infection (osteomyelitis and septic arthritis). Understanding and awareness of the imaging features related to this major morbidity complication are essential for early diagnosis and prompt management. In about half of the patients with SCD, AVN can lead to chronic pain, particularly in the head of the femur and humerus. Humeral and femoral head AVN tend to be linked with each other.  Vertebral bone compression and collapse secondary to AVN have also been reported.  The diagnosis of AVN must be accurate, as the condition is complex requiring specific treatment according to the grade of bone and joint involvement. There are several classifications or staging systems used for grading bone and joint involvement. Knowledge of the image patterns and grade of affection in different joints and bones and the degree of progression of AVN lesions can markedly improve management decisions on AVN-specific surgical versus non-surgical interventions and improve patient outcomes. The aim of this report is to summarize the different imaging techniques and their role in the proper/early diagnosis and follow up of patients with AVN with detailed examples of the common sites involved.
38319834		Should Intravenous Fluids Be Administered During Hospitalizations for Sickle-Cell Disease?Intravenous Fluids for Sickle-Cell DiseaseA 30-year-old woman with sickle-cell disease presents with diffuse pain in her arms, legs, and back. She has had frequent vaso-occlusive episodes, and this episode feels similar to previous ones. She is admitted for treatment, including with intravenous pain medications. Should she also receive intravenous fluids?
34331507	treat|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Thalassemia ;treat|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell	Effects of hydroxyurea on brain function in children with sickle cell anemia.INTRODUCTION: Sickle cell anemia (SCA) results in numerous adverse effects on the brain, including neurocognitive dysfunction. Hydroxyurea has been utilized extensively for management of SCA, but its effects on brain function have not been established. METHODS: We examined prospectively the effects of 1 year of treatment with hydroxyurea on brain function in children with SCA (HbSS/HbSbeta0 -thalassemia) by baseline and exit evaluations, including comprehensive neurocognitive testing, transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD), and brain MRI (silent cerebral infarcts [SCI], gray matter cerebral blood flow [GM-CBF], and blood oxygen level-dependent [BOLD] signal from visual stimulation). RESULTS: Nineteen patients with SCA, mean age 12.4 years (range 7.2-17.8), were evaluated. At baseline, subjects had these mean values: full-scale IQ (FSIQ) 82.8, TCD velocity 133 cm/s, GM-CBF 64.4 ml/100 g/min, BOLD signal 2.34% increase, and frequency of SCI 47%. After 1 year of hydroxyurea, there were increases in FSIQ (+2, p = .059) and reading passage comprehension (+4, p = .033), a significant decrease in TCD velocity (-11 cm/s, p = .007), and no significant changes in GM-CBF, BOLD, or SCI frequency. Hemoglobin F (HbF) was associated with passage comprehension, hemoglobin with lower TCD velocity, and lower GM-CBF with greater working memory. Higher BOLD signal was associated with higher processing speed and lower TCD velocity with higher math fluency. DISCUSSION: Improvements in neurocognition and decreased TCD velocity following 1 year of treatment support hydroxyurea use for improving neurocognitive outcomes in SCA. Understanding the mechanisms of benefit, as indicated by relationships of neurocognitive function with HbF, hemoglobin, and CBF, requires further evaluation.
36310401		Hypoxic storage of donor red cells preserves deformability after exposure to plasma from adults with sickle cell disease.BACKGROUND: Red cell (RBC) transfusions are beneficial for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), but ex vivo studies suggest that inflamed plasma from patients with SCD during crises may damage these RBCs, diminishing their potential efficacy. The hypoxic storage of RBCs may improve transfusion efficacy by minimizing the storage lesion. We tested the hypotheses that (1) The donor RBCs exposed to the plasma of patients in crisis would have lower deformability and higher hemolysis than those exposed to non-crisis plasma, and (2) hypoxic storage, compared to standard storage, of donor RBCs could preserve deformability and reduce hemolysis. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: 18 SCD plasma samples from patients who had severe acute-phase symptoms (A-plasma; n = 9) or were at a steady-state (S = plasma; n = 9) were incubated with 16 RBC samples from eight units that were stored either under conventional(CRBC) or hypoxic(HRBC) conditions. Hemolysis and microcapillary deformability assays of these RBCs were analyzed using linear mixed-effect models after each sample was incubated in patient plasma overnight at 37 C RESULTS: Relative deformability was 0.036 higher (p < 0.0001) in HRBC pairs compared to CRBC pairs regardless of plasma type. Mean donor RBC hemolysis was 0.33% higher after incubation with A-plasma compared to S-plasma either with HRBC or CRBC (p = 0.04). HRBCs incubated with steady-state patient plasma demonstrated the highest deformability and lowest hemolysis. CONCLUSION: Hypoxic storage significantly influenced RBC deformability. Patient condition significantly influenced post-incubation hemolysis. Together, HRBCs in steady-state plasma maximized donor red cell ex vivo function and survival.
36531255		Evaluation of left ventricular systolic function in children with sickle cell anemia: contribution of 2D strain.BACKGROUND: Children with sickle cell anemia (SCA) are at an increased risk of cardiovascular complications. The aim of this study was to assess the role of speckle tracking echocardiography in detecting subclinical myocardial damage in children with SCA. METHODS: A cross-sectional case-control study was conducted at the echocardiography laboratory of the military hospital of Tunis between July and December 2018. Thirty patients with SCA were included. A control(C) group including 30 normally developing children was selected and matched to the SCA group by sex and age. We compared between the two groups: conventional echocardiographic parameters including cardiac output, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), thickness and the global longitudinal strain (GLS). The echocardiographic measurements were indexed according to body surface area. The left ventricular (LV) GLS association with clinical characteristics and echocardiographic parameters were also evaluated. RESULTS: Patients and controls were matched for age and sex: the mean age was (11+- 2years) in SCA group versus (12+- 1 years) in C group with a sex ratio of (1.31 versus 1.27, respectively). Body surface area was comparable. LV hypertrophy and dilation were revealed in the SCA group, whereas measurements were normal in the C group. No significant differences were observed for cardiac output (p=0.4). LVEF were preserved in both groups. However, two-dimensional (2D) LVGLS was impaired in 46% of SCA group (n=14) with mean value of (-21%+-3.07 vs -25%+-2.98; p<0.01).In SCA group, impaired LVGLS was significantly associated with LV mass (r = - 0.399, p<0.01), LV tele diastolic diameter(r= -0.419, p<0.01) and left atrial volume (r= - 0.399, p< 0.04). In multivariate analysis, LV mass was the only independent factor. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, LVGLS measurement revealed subclinical LV systolic impairment in patients with SCA. Therefore, 2D strain could be beneficial to detect the natural history of LV dysfunction in SCA.
36737235		Cerebral artery conditional blood velocity in sickle cell disease: a multicentre study and evidence for active treatment.OBJECTIVE: To obtain multicentre data on the prevalence of normal, high or conditional (intermediate) blood velocity in the cerebral arteries among children with sickle cell disease (SCD) in Nigeria. DESIGN: A prospective observational study in five tertiary healthcare institutions. By transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonography, cerebral artery peak systolic blood velocity (PSV) was determined in 193 children with SCD and time averaged mean of the maximum blood velocity (TAMMV) in a different cohort of 115 children. This design was to make the findings relevant to hospitals with TCD equipment that measure either PSV or TAMMV. SETTING: Nigeria. PARTICIPANTS: 308 children (126 girls, 182 boys; age 2-16 years). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Percentage of children with SCD who have normal, high or intermediate (often termed conditional) PSV or TAMMV. RESULTS: In the cohort of 193 children, PSV was normal in 150 (77.7%), high in 7 (3.6%) and conditional in 36 (18.7%). In the cohort of 115 children, TAMMV was normal in 96 (84%), high in 7 (6%) and conditional in 12 (10%). There were no significant differences in gender or age distribution between the PSV and TAMMV cohorts. Altogether, cerebral artery blood velocity was normal in 246/308 children (80%), high in 14 (4.5%) and conditional in 48 (15.5%). CONCLUSION: Since conditional blood velocity in cerebral arteries can progress to high values and predispose to stroke, the proportion of children with SCD who are affected (15.5%) raises the question of whether regular monitoring and proactive intervention ought to be the standard of care.
36400543		Genotyping and the Future of Transfusion in Sickle Cell Disease.Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) have a high rate of red cell alloimmunization, which increases morbidity and mortality. Reasons for this susceptibility are multifactorial, but differences in antigen frequency between donors and recipients are one of the modifiable risk factors. Here, we evaluate the benefits of red cell molecular antigen-typing for both patients with SCD and their donors and describe how results from these critical tests could be used to enhance patient safety.
34389204		Systematic RHD genotyping in Brazilians reveals a high frequency of partial D in transfused patients serologically typed as weak D.BACKGROUND: The discrimination between weak D types and partial D can be of clinical importance because carriers of partial D antigen may develop anti-D when transfused with D-positive red blood cell units. The aim of this study was to determine by molecular analysis the type of D variants among Brazilian patients requiring transfusions with serologic weak D phenotypes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Samples from 87 patients (53 with sickle cell disease, 10 with thalassemia and 24 with myelodysplastic syndrome), serologic typed as weak D by manual tube indirect antiglobulin test or gel test were first RHD genotyped by using the RHD BeadChip Kit (BioArray, Immucor). Sanger sequencing was performed when necessary. RESULTS: RHD molecular analysis revealed 32 (36.8 %) variant RHD alleles encoding weak D phenotypes and 55 (63.2 %) alleles encoding partial D antigens. RHD variant alleles were present in the homozygous state or as a single RHD allele, one variant RHD allele associated with the RHDPsi allele, or two different variant RHD alleles in compound heterozygosity with each other in 70 patients, 4 patients and 13 patients, respectively. Alloanti-D was found in 9 (16.4 %) cases with RHD alleles predicting a partial D. DISCUSSION: The frequency of partial D was higher than weak D types in Brazilian patients serologically typed as weak D, showing the importance to differentiate weak D types and partial D in transfused patients to establish a transfusion policy recommendation.

36789724		Rapid MRI Assessment of Long-Axis Strain to Indicate Systolic Dysfunction in Patients With Sickle Cell Disease.BACKGROUND: Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) have a unique form of cardiomyopathy. However, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is often preserved. Monoplanar long-axis strain (LAS) can be assessed from MRI four-chamber views and may be better at detecting mild systolic dysfunction in these patients. PURPOSE: To compare LAS (monoplanar and biplanar) with LVEF as a marker of systolic dysfunction in SCD patients. STUDY TYPE: Retrospective. SUBJECTS: A total of 20 patients with genetically proven SCD (35 MRI examinations), 39 healthy controls, and 124 patients with systemic iron overload (for validation purposes). FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 1.5 T/3 T. Cine balanced steady-state free-precession. ASSESSMENT: Rapidly assessed biplanar LAS from four- and two-chamber views was correlated with age and compared to LVEF by two operators. For validation, biplanar LAS was compared to global longitudinal strain (GLS) using MRI feature-tracking in 124 patients with systemic iron overload. STATISTICAL TESTS: Bland-Altman analysis. Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test and Spearman-rank correlation (correlation coefficient, rS ). Receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curve analysis (area under the curve, AUC). Bivariate discriminant analysis. Significance level: P < 0.01. RESULTS: There was strong correlation between biplanar LAS and GLS using feature tracking (rS  = 0.73). Interoperator agreement showed nonsignificant bias for biplanar LAS (-0.02%; +-95%-agreement interval -2.2%/2.2%, P = 0.9). Biplanar LAS increased significantly with age in controls (rS  = 0.70). In SCD patients, biplanar LAS was better correlated with age than monoplanar LAS (r2  = 0.53, standard error of estimate, SEE = 1.4% vs. r2  = 0.37;SEE = 2.0%). ROC analysis of LVEF, biplanar LAS, and age-adjusted Z-scores Z (LAS(age)) showed AUCs of 0.69, 0.75, and 0.86 for differentiation between SCD patients and controls. Bivariate discriminant analysis of biplanar Z (LAS(age)) and LVEF revealed a sensitivity of 63% and a specificity of 95%. DATA CONCLUSION: Rapidly assessed biplanar LAS demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy and was an indicator of mild systolic dysfunction in patients with SCD. Biplanar LAS provided more precise measurements than monoplanar, and normalization to age increased diagnostic accuracy. EVIDENCE LEVEL: 3. TECHNICAL EFFICACY: Stage 2.
34898140		Acute Myeloid Leukemia Case after Gene Therapy for Sickle Cell Disease.Gene therapy with LentiGlobin for sickle cell disease (bb1111, lovotibeglogene autotemcel) consists of autologous transplantation of a patient's hematopoietic stem cells transduced with the BB305 lentiviral vector that encodes the betaA-T87Q-globin gene. Acute myeloid leukemia developed in a woman approximately 5.5 years after she had received LentiGlobin for sickle cell disease as part of the initial cohort (Group A) of the HGB-206 study. An analysis of peripheral-blood samples revealed that blast cells contained a BB305 lentiviral vector insertion site. The results of an investigation of causality indicated that the leukemia was unlikely to be related to vector insertion, given the location of the insertion site, the very low transgene expression in blast cells, and the lack of an effect on expression of surrounding genes. Several somatic mutations predisposing to acute myeloid leukemia were present after diagnosis, which suggests that patients with sickle cell disease are at increased risk for hematologic malignant conditions after transplantation, most likely because of a combination of risks associated with underlying sickle cell disease, transplantation procedure, and inadequate disease control after treatment.

35679148		Safety and Acceptance of Acupuncture and Acupressure in Children, Adolescents, and Young Adults Undergoing Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant.BACKGROUND: Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is associated with significant morbidity and high symptom burden including mucositis pain, nausea, and vomiting. There is little documentation in the literature regarding acupuncture or acupressure for children undergoing HSCT. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the safety and acceptance of acupuncture and acupressure in children undergoing HSCT in a large tertiary care children's hospital. METHODS: This is a descriptive retrospective study that evaluated 80 admissions to the HSCT unit over a 24-month period. Every child admitted for HSCT was offered acupuncture or acupressure as part of their care. RESULTS: Of 80 patients, 46 were male patients (ages range, 0-32 years; mean, 8 years). Diagnoses include leukemia/lymphoma, sickle cell disease, aplastic anemia, neuroblastoma, and other metabolic, other solid tumor, or other hematologic disorders. Both allogenic and autologous were represented. Sixty-six patients (82.5%) agreed to treatment with acupuncture, acupressure, or both. There were no adverse effects or safety concerns noted. Symptoms addressed by acupuncture or acupressure included pain from mucositis, nausea, constipation, diarrhea, anxiety, insomnia, and general wellness or healing. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that acupuncture and acupressure are well accepted by children and their families admitted for HSCT and are safe even when performed in the first 4 weeks following transplant when the patient is likely to have thrombocytopenia. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: These findings suggest that there may be more therapies for patients undergoing HSCT to help with symptom control.
33974588		Maintenance of an Immunogenic Response to Pneumococcal Vaccination in Children With Sickle Cell Disease.Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) are at increased risk for invasive pneumococcal disease because of splenic dysfunction. To mitigate this risk, patients are protected with prophylactic penicillin until completion of pneumococcal vaccination series. The objective of this study was to assess the maintenance of a protective immune response to pneumococcal vaccination in children with SCD. A retrospective review was conducted between June 2019 and June 2020 of all patients with SCD patients for whom it had been 5+-1 year since completion of PPSV23 vaccination series. A total of 41 patients were analyzed. The majority of children (68%) were able to maintain an adequate immune response. There was no identifiable disease characteristic associated with maintenance of an appropriate immunogenic response. This study finds that patients with SCD are able to maintain an adequate immune response at the 5+-1 year time point from completion of PPSV23 vaccination series. Similarly, patients were not found to have an increased rate of invasive pneumococcal disease even if not meeting criteria for adequate pneumococcal serum titer levels. Maintenance of pneumococcal titers suggests that there may not be a need for revaccination at the 5-year time point in this patient population.
36485115		Long-term health outcomes following curative therapies for sickle cell disease.Treatment options for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) continue to rapidly expand and evolve. The goal of therapies such as an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), gene therapy, and gene editing is to cure rather than control SCD. The benefits of these therapies must be accompanied by minimizing long-term adverse health outcomes from SCD and its treatment. SCD can have adverse effects on a variety of organ systems, including the heart, lung, kidney, and reproductive system, leading to high disease burden, morbidity, and premature mortality in both pediatric and adult patients. While curative therapies are being increasingly used, there remains a paucity of data on the long-term health outcomes associated with these treatments in children and adults with SCD. There are data available regarding the effects of HSCT performed largely for malignant diseases, from which data on SCD outcomes may be extrapolated. However, given the significant differences between these 2 populations of patients who undergo HSCT, such extrapolation is imprecise at best. Furthermore, there are currently no published data on long-term health outcomes following gene therapy for SCD due to current short follow-up times. We summarize the limited data reported on health outcomes following HSCT for SCD and emphasize the need for more research within this area.
36645839		Prevalence and Risk Factors for Pulmonary Embolism in Pediatric Sickle Cell Disease: A National Administrative Database Study.Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) have a high risk for venous thromboembolism which is associated with increased risk of mortality. Studies examining risk of pulmonary embolism (PE) in children with SCD are lacking. This study was conducted in children with SCD between 0-21 years of age using a nationwide administrative database in the United States- Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) from January 2010 to June 2021. Diagnostic codes and imaging, procedure, and pharmaceutical billing codes were used to identify PE and potential clinical, demographic, and utilization risk factors. Logistic regression analyses were performed to assess association between risk factors and PE. We identified 22,631 unique patients with SCD with a median age of 10.8 years (range: <0.1-20.9). A total of 120 (0.53%) patients developed a PE with median age of 17.4 years (range: 6.6-20.9) at PE diagnosis. Patients with PE had longer hospitalization and more frequent ICU admissions than patients without PE (p < 0.001). Risk factors significantly associated with PE on multivariable analysis included older age, prior history of central venous line (CVL), acute chest syndrome, and apheresis. Mortality was not significantly different between those with and without PE. The prevalence of PE in hospitalized children with SCD was estimated to be 0.53%. Patients with PE had higher healthcare utilization characteristics. Factors significantly associated with PE suggest that the risk for PE in SCD may be related to the severity of disease state. Future trials are needed for risk stratification and PE prevention strategies in children with SCD.
37565437		Laboratory Associations With Transcranial Doppler Categories in Sickle Cell Disease.
35091127		Corrected cerebral blood flow and reduced cerebral inflammation in berk sickle mice with higher fetal hemoglobin.Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) is known to lessen the severity of sickle cell disease (SCD), through reductions in peripheral vaso-occlusive disease and reduced risk for cerebrovascular events. However, the influence of HbF on oxygen delivery to high metabolism tissues like the brain, or its influence on cerebral perfusion, metabolism, inflammation or function have not been widely studied. We employed a Berkley mouse model (BERK) of SCD with gamma transgenes q3 expressing exclusively human alpha- and betaS-globins with varying levels of gamma globin expression to investigate the effect of HbF expression on the brain using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), MRI diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and spectroscopy (MRS) and hematological parameters. Hematological parameters improved with increasing gamma level expression, as did markers for brain metabolism, perfusion and inflammation. Brain microstructure assessed by DTI fractional anisotropy improved, while myo-inositol levels increased, suggesting improved microstructural integrity and reduced cell loss. Our results suggest that increasing gamma levels not only improves sickle peripheral disease, but also improves brain perfusion and oxygen delivery while reducing brain inflammation while protecting brain microstructural integrity.
35975381		In vitro study of the effect of high temperature on erythrocytes in sickle cell trait.Background: Although, sickle cell trait (SCT) was considered a benign condition with most patients being asymptomatic, however, there is an impressive increase in the number of sudden deaths in the military recruits and athletes, which has led to SCT as a rapidly emerging medical issue. Genetic factors have been extensively investigated in the etiopathogenesis of SCT but, environmental factors have not been studied in depth. Aims: The main aim of this study was to investigate the effect of high temperature on the red blood cells (RBCs) in those with SCT and compare this to a control group lacking SCT. Patients and Methods: Heat stress to RBCs was induced by in vitro incubation of freshly drawn blood at high temperatures (45 C for 35 min). Additional information such as hemoglobin (Hb) level, RBC count, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and hemoglobin S level was obtained from the medical record of the case and control groups. Data were entered in Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 22.0 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, United States) and analyzed to examine the research hypothesis. Results: A total of 17 blood samples from SCT (HbAS subjects) labeled as cases and 16 samples from controls (HbAA subjects) were included in this study. The results of this study showed no significant change in sickled erythrocytes in SCT in response to in vitro heat stress. Conclusion: This study's findings appear to suggest that hyperthermia could be excluded as one of the major factors inducing sickling complications during exhausting exercise. Long-term studies in the future are recommended in this area, particularly to assess the effect of high temperature and sudden death in SCT.
37612699		Factors associated with hospital admission and 30-day readmission for children less than 18 years of age in 2018 in France: a one-year nationwide observational study.BACKGROUND: Nationwide data for children for short-stay hospitalisation (SSH) and associated factors are scarce. This retrospective study of children in France < 18 years of age followed after their birth or birthday in 2018 focused on at least one annual SSH, stay < 1 night or >= 1 night, or 30-day readmission >= 1 night. METHODS: Children were selected from the national health data system (SNDS), which includes data on long-term chronic disease (LTD) status with full reimbursement and complementary universal coverage based on low household income (CMUC). Uni and multivariate quasi-Poisson regression were applied for each outcome. RESULTS: Among 13.211 million children (94.4% population, 51.2% boys), CMUC was identified for 17.5% and at least one LTD for 4% (0-<1 year: 1.5%; 14-<18 year: 5.2%). The most frequent LTDs were pervasive developmental diseases (0.53%), asthma (0.24%), epilepsy (0.17%), and type 1 diabetes (0.15%). At least one SSH was found for 8.8%: SSH < 1 night (4.9%), SSH >= 1 night (4.5%), readmission (0.4%). Children with at least one SSH were younger (median 6 vs. 9 years) and more often had CMUC (21%), a LTD (12%), an emergency department (ED) visit (56%), or various primary healthcare visits than all children. Those with a SSH >=1 night vs. < 1 night were older (median: 9 vs. 4 years). They had the same frequency of LTD (13.4%) but more often an ED visit (78% vs. 42%). Children with readmissions were younger (median 3 years). They had the highest levels of CMUC (29.3%), LTD (34%), EDs in their municipality (35% vs. 29% for the whole population) and ED visits (87%). In adjusted analysis, each outcome was significantly less frequent among girls than boys and more frequent for children with CMUC. LTDs with the largest association with SSH < 1 night were cystic fibrosis, sickle cell diseases (SCD), diabetes type 1, those with SSH >=1 night type 1 diabetes epilepsy and SCD, and those for readmissions lymphoid leukaemia, malignant neoplasm of the brain, and SCD. Among all SSH admissions of children < 10 years, 25.8% were potentially preventable. CONCLUSION: Higher SSH and readmission rates were found for children with certain LTD living in low-income households, suggesting the need or increase of specific policy actions and research.
34335138		Prospective Newborn Screening for Sickle Cell Disease and Other Inherited Blood Disorders in Central Malawi.Objectives: Newborn screening in the United States and Europe allows early identification of congenital disorders but does not yet exist in most low-resource settings, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Newborn screening can identify multiple inherited hematological disorders, but feasibility and effectiveness for Africa are not fully determined. Methods: Surplus dried blood spot collected in Central Malawi through the HIV Early Infant Diagnosis surveillance program were repurposed and tested by isoelectric focusing for sickle cell disease and trait. Additional genetic testing identified G6PD deficiency and alpha thalassemia. Results: Testing of 10,529 cards revealed an overall sickle cell trait prevalence of 7.0% (range 3.9-9.7% by district); 10 of 14 infants identified with sickle cell disease (prevalence 0.1%) were located and received care at a specialized clinic. Subsequent testing of 1,329 randomly selected cards identified alpha thalassemia trait in 45.7% of samples, and G6PD deficiency in 20.4% of males and 3.4% of females, with 29.0% of females as heterozygous carriers. Conclusion: Inherited hematological disorders are common in Central Malawi; early identification through newborn screening can improve clinical outcomes and should be supported throughout Africa.

36708736		Expecting more: the case for incorporating fertility services into comprehensive sickle cell disease care.Assisted reproductive technologies (ART) are not yet systematically available to people with sickle cell disease or their parents. Fertility care for these groups requires addressing sickle cell disease-associated infertility risks, fertility preservation options, pregnancy possibilities and outcomes, and, when needed, infertility treatment. People with a chance of having a child with sickle cell disease can use in-vitro fertilisation with preimplantation genetic testing to conceive a child unaffected by sickle cell disease. Also, parents of children with sickle cell disease can use this technology to identify embryos to become potential future matched sibling donors for stem cell transplant. In the USA, disparities in fertility care for the sickle cell disease community are especially stark. Universal screening of newborn babies' identifies sickle cell disease and sickle cell trait, guidelines direct preconception genetic carrier screening, and standard-of-care fertility preserving options exist. However, potentially transformative treatments and cures for patients with sickle cell disease are not used due to iatrogenic infertility concerns. In diversely resourced care settings, obstacles to providing fertility care to people affected by sickle cell disease persist. In this Viewpoint, we contend that fertility care should be incorporated into the comprehensive care model for sickle cell disease, supporting alignment of treatment goals with reproductive life plans and delivering on the promise of individualised high-quality care for people with sickle cell disease and their families. We consider the obligation to provide fertility care in light of medical evidence, with acknowledgment of formidable obstacles to optimising care, and powerful historical and ethical considerations.
36369918		Knowledge and Attitude toward Hemoglobinopathies in Premarital Screening Program among the General Population in the Western Region of Saudi Arabia.The National Premarital Screening Program, which includes sickle cell disease and thalassemia, was made mandatory in 2004 by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), and the earlier studies have shown a poor knowledge and negative attitude toward this program in the different study groups. This study was conducted to assess the knowledge and attitudes toward premarital screening (PMS) in a randomly selected national sample of the Saudi population, 18 years and above. This was a cross-sectional study conducted in the Saudi population in the western region between July and December 2021. Valid and reliable questionnaire and data were collected from 893 participants aged >=18 years. The chi2 test was used to ascertain if there is an association between categorical variables. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine factors predicting satisfactory knowledge. All 893 study participants had heard about PMS with 625 (70.0%), 244 (27.3%) and 24 (2.7%) having satisfactory, fair and poor knowledge, respectively. Participants aged 26-35 years (p =0 .038), females (p < 0.001), those with higher education (p = 0.003) and employed (p = 0.004), had a better knowledge compared to other groups. Most of the participants had a positive attitude toward PMS. There is a changing trend in the knowledge and attitude toward PMS with a greater number of people wanting to go for PMS. There is also an improvement in the number of participants opting out of marriage in case of incompatibility with their future partner. However, the health education programs need to be improved regarding the hemoglobinopathies.
33691718		Young child with painful edema and purpura: a case report.BACKGROUND: We reported the case of a two-old-year boy with a painful acute hemorrhagic edema. This is a self-limited benign condition: usually, affected children are well appearing and this strongly support the diagnosis. In the opposite, in our case, we observed a painful presentation of the edema. Therefore, we demonstrated that rarely, this condition could have also a painful presentation. CONCLUSIONS: This case report helps clinician to know that also acute hemorrhagic edema could have a painful presentation, so we must considered it in the differential diagnosis with sepsis, sickle cell crisis and child abuse. We believe that these findings will be of interest to pediatricians.
38031035	associate|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell|@GENE_CST3	Cystatin C-derived estimated glomerular filtration rate in children with sickle cell anaemia.BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease is the most common inherited blood disorder in humans and constitutes a major public health burden. It is a multisystemic condition with long-term renal complications. Early detection of sickle cell nephropathy and initiation of appropriate interventions are associated with improved survival and quality of life. This study aimed to compare the cystatin C-derived estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of the study groups and also, to correlate the clinical features of chronic kidney disease (CKD) with decreased GFR in children with sickle cell anaemia (SCA). METHODS: This hospital-based cross-sectional analytic study recruited 86 SCA subjects in steady-state and 86 age and sex-matched healthy HbAA controls aged 1-14 years who attended the Paediatric Haematology and Outpatient clinics of Federal Medical Centre Bida over six months. Data were collected using a semi-structured questionnaire, and participants' length/height, weight, and blood pressure were measured using standard procedures. Blood samples were drawn for serum cystatin C assay via the sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique. Filler's equation was used to calculate the glomerular filtration rate. RESULTS: There was a significant difference in the mean cystatin C-derived GFR between the two groups, i.e. 116 +- 30mL/min/1.73m2 vs. 106 +- 24mL/min/1.73m2 for the SCA and control groups, respectively (p = 0.017). The prevalence of supernormal GFR (i.e. GFR > 140mL/min/1.73m2) and decreased GFR (i.e. GFR < 90mL/min/1.73m2) was 19.8% and 22.1%, respectively, in children with SCA. There was no significant association between the age at diagnosis of SCA, blood transfusions, blood pressure, packed cell volume and presence of peripheral oedema with decreased GFR in the study subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Supernormal GFR is common in children with SCA and there is no significant association between clinical features of CKD with decreased GFR. Regular evaluation of renal function is, however, recommended in children with SCA for early detection and treatment of renal complications in order to halt the progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD).
34021342		Clinical validity and utility of preconception expanded carrier screening for the management of reproductive genetic risk in IVF and general population.STUDY QUESTION: What is the clinical validity and utility of preconception Expanded Carrier Screening (ECS) application on the management of prospective parents? SUMMARY ANSWER: The high detection rate of at-risk couples (ARCs) and the high proportion opting for IVF/preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) treatment demonstrate the clinical utility of ECS in the preconception space in IVF and general population. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: About 2-4% of couples are at risk of conceiving a child with an autosomal recessive or X-linked genetic disorder. In recent years, the increasing cost-effectiveness of genetic diagnostic techniques has allowed the creation of ECS panels for the simultaneous detection of multiple recessive disorders. Comprehensive preconception genetic screening holds the potential to significantly improve couple's genetic risk assessment and reproductive planning to avoid detectable inheritable genetic offspring. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A total of 3877 individuals without a family history of genetic conditions were analyzed between January 2017 and January 2020. Of the enrolled individuals, 1212 were gamete donors and 2665 were patients planning on conceiving from both the IVF and the natural conception group. From the non-donor cohort, 1133 were analyzed as individual patients, while the remaining ones were analyzed as couples, for a total of 766 couples. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: A focused ECS panel was developed following American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology ACOG-recommended criteria (prevalence, carrier rate, severity), including highly penetrant severe childhood conditions. Couples were defined at-risk when both partners carried an autosomal recessive pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant (PLP) on the same gene or when the woman was a carrier of an X-linked PLP variant. ARC detection rate defined the clinical validity of the ECS approach. Clinical utility was evaluated by monitoring ARCs reproductive decision making. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: A total of 402 individuals (10.4%) showed PLP for at least one of the genes tested. Among the 766 couples tested, 173 showed one carrier partner (22.6%), whereas 20 couples (2.6%) were found to be at increased risk. Interestingly, one ARC was identified as a result of cascade testing in the extended family of an individual carrying a pathogenic variant on the Survival Of Motor Neuron 1SMN1 gene. Of the identified ARCs, 5 (0.7%) were at risk for cystic fibrosis, 5 (0.7%) for fragile X syndrome, 4 (0.5%) for spinal muscular atrophy, 4 (0.5%) for Beta-Thalassemia/Sickle Cell Anemia, 1 (0.1%) for Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome and 1 (0.1%) for Duchenne/Becker Dystrophy. Fifteen ARCs were successfully followed up from both the IVF and the natural conception groups. All of these (15/15) modified their reproductive planning by undergoing ART with Preimplantation Genetic Testing for Monogenic disease and Aneuploidies (PGT-M and PGT-A). To date, 6/15 (40%) couples completed their PGT cycle with euploid/unaffected embryos achieving a pregnancy after embryo transfer and three of them have already had an unaffected baby. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The use of a limited panel of core gene-disease pairs represents a limitation on the research perspective as it can underestimate the rate of detectable carriers and ARCs in this cohort of prospective parents. Expanding the scope of ECS to a larger panel of conditions is becoming increasingly feasible, thanks to a persistent technological evolution and progressive cataloging of gene-disease associations. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: These results highlight the potential clinical validity and utility of ECS in reducing the risk of a pregnancy affected by a detectable inheritable genetic condition. The steady reduction in the costs of genetic analyses enables the expansion of monogenic testing/screening applications at the preimplantation stage, thus, providing valid decisional support and reproductive autonomy to patients, particularly in the context of IVF.

37715793	associate|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell|@GENE_LGALS3 ;associate|@DISEASE_Cardiovascular_Abnormalities|@GENE_LGALS3	Evaluation of cardiac fibrosis and subclinical cardiac changes in children with sickle cell disease using magnetic resonance imaging, echocardiography, and serum galectin-3.BACKGROUND: Myocardial fibrosis has recently been proposed as one of the contributing factors to the diverse pathogenicity of cardiomyopathy in sickle cell disease. OBJECTIVE: In this study, cardiac fibrosis and subclinical cardiac changes in children with sickle cell disease were evaluated using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), tissue Doppler echocardiography and serum galectin-3. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 34 children with sickle cell disease who were compared with a similar number of healthy controls. Cardiac MRI was used to evaluate late gadolinium enhancement, native T1 mapping, extracellular volume, and T2* for estimation of iron load. Cardiac function and myocardial performance index (MPI, evaluated by tissue Doppler echocardiography) and serum galectin-3 were compared to controls. RESULTS: The mean age of the included patients was 13.3 +- 3.2 years. Myocardial iron load by T2* was normal. The mean level of extracellular volume (35.41 +- 5.02%) was significantly associated with the frequency of vaso-occlusive crises (P = 0.017) and negatively correlated with hemoglobin levels (P = 0.005). Galectin-3 levels were significantly higher among cases than controls (P = 0.00), at a cutoff value on the receiver operating characteristic curve of 6.5 ng/ml, sensitivity of 82.5% and specificity of 72.8%. The extracellular volume was significantly higher in cases, with a MPI > 0.4. CONCLUSION: Diffuse interstitial myocardial fibrosis can be detected early in children with sickle cell disease using T1 mapping and is associated with a high frequency of vaso-occlusive crisis. MPI of the left ventricle and serum galectin-3 are recommended screening tools for subclinical cardiac abnormalities.

Females also appear to have a better response to hydroxyurea therapy, reduced markers of inflammation, and better liver function.
34139105		A systems pharmacology model for gene therapy in sickle cell disease.We developed a mathematical model for autologous stem cell therapy to cure sickle cell disease (SCD). Experimental therapies using this approach seek to engraft stem cells containing a curative gene. These stem cells are expected to produce a lifelong supply of red blood cells (RBCs) containing an anti-sickling hemoglobin. This complex, multistep treatment is expensive, and there is limited patient data available from early clinical trials. Our objective was to quantify the impact of treatment parameters, such as initial stem cell dose, efficiency of lentiviral transduction, and degree of bone marrow preconditioning on engraftment efficiency, peripheral RBC numbers, and anti-sickling hemoglobin levels over time. We used ordinary differential equations to model RBC production from progenitor cells in the bone marrow, and hemoglobin assembly from its constituent globin monomers. The model recapitulates observed RBC and hemoglobin levels in healthy and SCD phenotypes. Treatment simulations predict dynamics of stem cell engraftment and RBC containing the therapeutic gene product. Post-treatment dynamics show an early phase of reconstitution due to short lived stem cells, followed by a sustained RBC production from stable engraftment of long-term stem cells. This biphasic behavior was previously reported in the literature. Sensitivity analysis of the model quantified relationships between treatment parameters and efficacy. The initial dose of transduced stem cells, and the intensity of myeloablative bone marrow preconditioning are predicted to most positively impact long-term outcomes. The quantitative systems pharmacology approach used here demonstrates the value of model-assisted therapeutic design for gene therapies in SCD.
34234298		Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation reverses white matter injury measured by diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) in sickle cell disease patients.Brain injury in sickle cell disease (SCD) comprises a wide spectrum of neurological damage. Neurocognitive deficits have been described even without established neurological lesions. DTI is a rapid, noninvasive, and non-contrast method that enables detection of normal-appearing white matter lesions not detected by conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The aim of the study was to evaluate if stem cell transplantation can revert white matter lesions in patients with SCD. Twenty-eight SCD patients were evaluated with MRI and DTI before and after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), compared with 26 healthy controls (HC). DTI metrics included fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), radial (RD), and axial (AD) diffusivity maps, global efficiency, path length, and clustering coefficients. Compared to HC, SCD patients had a lower FA (p = 0.0086) before HSCT. After HSCT, FA increased and was not different from healthy controls (p = 0.1769). Mean MD, RD, and AD decreased after HSCT (p = 0.0049; p = 0.0029; p = 0.0408, respectively). We confirm previous data of white matter lesions in SCD and present evidence that HSCT promotes recovery of brain injury with potential improvement of brain structural connectivity.
36067800	associate|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell|@GENE_HBB	Diverse Approaches to Gene Therapy of Sickle Cell Disease.Sickle cell disease (SCD) results from a single base pair change in the sixth codon of the beta-globin chain of hemoglobin, which promotes aggregation of deoxyhemoglobin, increasing rigidity of red blood cells and causing vaso-occlusive and hemolytic complications. Allogeneic transplant of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) can eliminate SCD manifestations but is limited by absence of well-matched donors and immune complications. Gene therapy with transplantation of autologous HSCs that are gene-modified may provide similar benefits without the immune complications. Much progress has been made, and patients are realizing significant clinical improvements in multiple trials using different approaches with lentiviral vector-mediated gene addition to inhibit hemoglobin aggregation. Gene editing approaches are under development to provide additional therapeutic opportunities. Gene therapy for SCD has advanced from an attractive concept to clinical reality.
37865180		Multi-component Strategy Improves HPV Vaccination Rates among Adolescents with Sickle Cell Disease.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a vaccine strategy bundle to increase HPV vaccine initiation and completion in a specialty clinic setting. STUDY DESIGN: Our Hematology clinic utilized an implementation framework from October 1, 2018, to December 31, 2019, involving nurses, nursing coordinators, and clinicians in administering the HPV vaccination series to our adolescent sickle cell sample of nearly 500 patients. The bundle included education for staff on the need for HPV vaccine administration, provider incentives, vaccines offered to patients in SCD clinics, and verification of patients' charts of vaccine completion. RESULTS: Following the implementation of the bundle, the cumulative incidence of HPV vaccination initiation and completion improved from 28% to 46% and 7% to 49%, respectively. Both rates remained higher post-implementation as well. HPV vaccination series completion was associated with a decreased distance to the healthcare facility, lower state deprivation rank, and increased hospitalizations. CONCLUSION: Our clinic's implementation strategy successfully improved vaccine completion rates among adolescents with SCD while continuing to educate staff, patients, and families on the importance of cancer prevention among people living with SCD.
36485154		No crystal stair: supporting fertility care and the pursuit of pregnancy in women with sickle cell disease.Growing recognition that the ovary is an end organ in sickle cell disease (SCD), advances in SCD treatment and cure, and innovations in assisted reproductive technologies invite progressive challenges in fertility care for women with SCD. The reproductive life span of women with SCD may be reduced because ovarian reserve declines more rapidly in people with SCD compared to unaffected people. Some young women have diminished ovarian reserve, a risk factor for infertility. Referrals for fertility preservation may be offered and anticipatory guidance about when to seek infertility care provided. For a subset of people with SCD, this information is also applicable when pursuing in vitro fertilization with preimplantation genetic testing to avoid implantation of an embryo with SCD. Here we explore the dimensions of SCD-related fertility care illustrated by the case of a 28-year-old woman with hemoglobin SS disease who initially presented for a hematology consultation for preconception counseling. This case highlights the complexity of preconception SCD management and care and the need to partner with patients to help align pregnancy hopes with SCD treatment and the many associated uncertainties.

37576173		Sonographic Evaluation of Maternal Renal Echogenicity in Healthy Pregnant Women in the Niger Delta Region of Nigeria.Background: Increased renal echogenicity is a nonspecific ultrasound finding. It may be a normal variation or suggestive of various underlying conditions like renal amyloidosis, chronic kidney disease, sickle cell disease and HIV associated nephropathy (HIVAN). Objective: To study maternal renal echogenicity in normal pregnancy, and explore its relationship with maternal baseline characteristics in our subregion. Methods: This descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted in the Obstetrics and Radiology Units of the two tertiary health facilities, one secondary facility and one radio-diagnostic facility, all in Bayelsa State, South-South Nigeria, between March-August 2022. The relationships between maternal renal echogenicity and age, parity and gestational age were explored using Chi-square test of proportion, while with an analysis of variance (ANOVA), the mean difference of age, weight and height between the grades of renal echogenicity was investigated. Kruskal Wallis test was deployed to examine parity in the grades of renal echogenicity. The level of significance was set at p<0.05. Results: The study participants that had Grade 0, 1 and 2 renal echogenicity were 160 (39.7%), 403 (58.3%) and 8 (2.0%), respectively. There were statistically significant relationships between maternal renal echogenicity and maternal age (chi2=36.94; p=0.001), parity (chi2=64.29; p=0.001), gestational age (chi2=16.03; p=0.003) and body mass index (BMI) (chi2 = 45.15; p - 0.001). Conclusion: Our study revealed a significant relationship between maternal renal echogenicity in normal pregnancy and maternal baseline characteristics (age, parity, gestational age and weight).
34224261		Treatment of Acute Pain in Adults With Sickle Cell Disease in an Infusion Center Versus the Emergency Department : A Multicenter Prospective Cohort Study.BACKGROUND: Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) have vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs). Infusion centers (ICs) are alternatives to emergency department (ED) care and may improve patient outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether care in ICs or EDs leads to better outcomes for the treatment of uncomplicated VOCs. DESIGN: Prospective cohort. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02411396). SETTING: 4 U.S. sites, with recruitment between April 2015 and December 2016. PARTICIPANTS: Adults with SCD living within 60 miles of a study site. MEASUREMENTS: Participants were followed for 18 months after enrollment. Outcomes of interest were time to first dose of parenteral pain medication, whether pain reassessment was completed within 30 minutes after the first dose, and patient disposition on discharge from the acute care visit. Treatment effects for ICs versus EDs were estimated using a time-varying propensity score adjustment. RESULTS: Researchers enrolled 483 participants; the 269 who had acute care visits on weekdays are included in this report. With inverse probability of treatment-weighted adjustment, the mean time to first dose was 62 minutes in ICs and 132 minutes in EDs; the difference was 70 minutes (95% CI, 54 to 98 minutes; E-value, 2.8). The probability of pain reassessment within 30 minutes of the first dose of parenteral pain medication was 3.8 times greater (CI, 2.63 to 5.64 times greater; E-value, 4.7) in the IC than the ED. The probability that a participant's visit would end in admission to the hospital was smaller by a factor of 4 (0.25 [CI, 0.18 to 0.33]) with treatment in an IC versus an ED. LIMITATION: The study was restricted to participants with uncomplicated VOCs. CONCLUSION: In adults with SCD having a VOC, treatment in an IC is associated with substantially better outcomes than treatment in an ED.

35068390		Overview of current progress and challenges in diagnosis, and management of pediatric sickle cell disease in Democratic Republic of the Congo.OBJECTIVES: Sickle cell disease (SCD) encompasses health complications, primarily affecting the hematologic system and leading to high death rates in childhood. As a rule, the World Health Organisation (WHO) stepwise gold-standard about the strategies for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of SCD must be multidimensional. This overview aimed to highlight current advances and challenges linked to strategic issues, diagnosis, the prevalence, and treatment of pediatric cases in Sub-Saharan Africa, particularly the Democratic Republic of the Congo. METHODS: We searched data on Google Scholar, Medline, PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, and ResearchGate. RESULTS: The laboratory diagnosis of SCD has progressed from conventional electrophoresis to rapid point-of-care tests that allows early neonate screening. HemoTypeSCTM is an affordable test for neonatal screening in DRC. The pediatric SCD prevalence in Sub-Saharan Africa lay within 1-7.7% of homozygous(SS) and 15-40% of the heterozygous(AS) forms of SCD, depending on the method used and the ethnic population tested. Various supportive management protocols for comorbidities and complications exist, but they are not standardized in the Region. CONCLUSION: Notwithstanding some progress accomplished, the disease is still challenging in Sub-Saharan Africa due to limited early diagnostic testing and a lack of specific medications. There is a need for harmonizing therapeutic protocols and conducting controlled valid clinical trials.
37656986		Muscle Properties, Gross Motor Performance, and Quality of Life in Children With Sickle Cell Disease.PURPOSE: To explore muscle properties, gross motor performance, and quality of life (QoL) in children with sickle cell disease (SCD) compared with controls and to assess relationships among these outcomes. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 24 children assessed muscle properties including: knee extension strength by dynamometry; vastus lateralis (VL) and rectus femoris (RF) muscle thickness by ultrasonography; and VL and RF neuromuscular activation (rate of muscle activation [RoA]) by electromyography (EMG). Gross motor performance and QoL were assessed by standardized tests and questionnaires. RESULTS: Children with SCD had impaired knee extension strength, VL EMG RoA, gross motor performance, and QoL compared with children without SCD. Relationships among muscle properties, gross motor performance, and QoL were identified. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that comprehensive muscle properties, gross motor performance, and QoL assessments should be considered to support and develop individualized physical therapy plans for children with SCD.
35151720		A meta-analysis of variability in conjunctival microvascular hemorheology metrics.Conjunctival hemorheology has been used analytically to assess qualities of blood flow associated with various forms of cardiovascular disorders including diabetes mellitus, stroke, and sickle cell disease. Although conjunctival axial red blood cell velocity (Vax) has been demonstrated in varying disease states, benchmark measures of Vax are not well-defined. Due to various methodologic differences in assessment of Vax, interstudy consistency of hemorheological metrics is susceptible to both systematic and random error. Our study examines interstudy heterogeneity of Vax as measured in the conjunctival microvasculature of healthy subjects and assesses the overall perturbation of Vax based on disease state. Furthermore, our study aims to establish a potential range of normative Vax by comparing inter-study measurements in healthy patients. The most widely employed analytic approach to assess Vax was space-time analysis (n = 30). Using a meta-analytic approach, the prediction interval for Vax in healthy subjects among 20 studies ranged from 0.32-2.60 mm/s with a combined effect size of 0.52 +- 0.03 (CI: 0.46-0.59) mm/s. Inter-study comparison of Vax in healthy patients showed a high degree of variability (I2: 98.96%), due to studies with low measurement precision and/or dissimilar analytic methodology. Neither age nor diameter was a clinically significant moderator of Vax measurements in healthy patients. The combined effect size, defined as the composite Hedge's g of studies comparing healthy and disease state mean Vax, was 0.21 +- 0.13. High heterogeneity (I2: 80.48%) was observed in studies analyzing the difference between mean Vax in healthy and disease state patients. This heterogeneity was also observed when the difference in mean Vax between healthy and disease state patients was assessed in subgroups based on disease condition (I2: vascular disease 33%, sickle cell disease 62.22%, other 83.43%). Age was found to be a significant moderator (p = 0.048, beta = -0.40) of Hedge's g while diameter was not. No significant publication bias was observed in studies presenting healthy patient Vax or in studies comparing Vax between healthy and disease state patients. In summary, although homogeneity can be seen in healthy group Vax measurements, a high degree of statistical heterogeneity is found in Vax assessment comparing healthy and disease conditions that is not fully explained by methodologic variability.
34411499		Therapist-oriented home rehabilitation for adults with sickle cell anemia: effects on muscle strength, functional capacity, and quality of life.OBJECTIVES: Considering the advances in functional rehabilitation in recent decades, therapist-oriented home rehabilitation (TOHR) has been increasingly used in the field of physical therapy because it increases patient compliance and reduces health system costs. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of TOHR on functional capacity, muscle strength, and quality of life (QoL) in adults with sickle cell anemia (SCA). METHODS: Forty adults with SCA underwent manually guided TOHR for 12 weeks. Before and at the end of training, the following variables were assessed in the participants: distance covered in the 6-min walk test (6MWD); maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP); maximal expiratory pressure (MEP); handgrip strength (HGS); quadriceps strength (QS); and QoL using the Short Form-36 physical component summary (SF-36PCS) and the Short Form-36 mental component summary (SF-36MCS). RESULTS: After TOHR, significant increases were observed in the mean values for the 6MWD, MIP, MEP, HGS, QS, and SF-36PCS and SF-36MCS scores. The relative delta between the pre- and post-TOHR 6MWDs correlated significantly with the relative deltas of MIP (rs = 0.640, p < 0.0001), MEP (rs = 0.587, p < 0.0001), HGS (rs = 0.360, p = 0.022), and QS (rs = 0.351, p = 0.026). When the participants were separated according to their use of hydroxyurea, significant increases were observed in the relative deltas of the 6MWD, MIP and MEP values. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that TOHR can potentially increase functional capacity, muscle strength, and QoL in adults with SCA.

It results in a drop in hemoglobin to below pretransfusion levels and frequently reticulocytopenia. CASE REPORT: We report a case of a man in his thirties with SCD with a recent hospitalization 2 weeks prior for COVID-19. His red cell antibody history included anti-Fy(a) and warm autoantibody. At that time, he was given 2 units of RBC and discharged with a hemoglobin of 10.2 g/dl. He returned to the hospital approximately 1.5 weeks later with hemoglobin 6.0 g/dl and symptoms concerning for acute chest syndrome. Pretransfusion testing now showed 4+ pan-agglutinin in both gel-based and tube-based testing. Alloadsorption identified an anti-N and a strong cold agglutinin. Three least incompatible units were transfused to this patient over several days, with evidence of hemolysis. Further reference lab work revealed anti-Fya , anti-Fyb , anti-Lea , anti-Leb , and an anti-KN system antibody. The patient's hemoglobin nadired at 4.4 g/dl. The patient was treated with a single dose of tocilizumab, his hemoglobin stabilized, and he was discharged. DISCUSSION: We present a case of HHS proximate to recent SARS-CoV-2 infection with multiple allo and autoantibodies identified. Information on the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and HHS is limited; however, it is possible that inflammation related to COVID-19 could predispose to HHS. Tocilizumab is an approved treatment for COVID-19. Additionally, tocilizumab appears to be a promising treatment option for patients with HHS.

Infection has been found to be a major cause of hospitalisation, a major precipitant of crises and one of the greatest causes of death among SCD patients at all ages. OBJECTIVES: The objective of the study was to determine the prevalence of bacterial infection, pattern of the isolates and the antibiotic sensitivity of isolated bacteria among children with sickle cell anaemia (SCA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study carried out in the University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital. A total of 242 hospitalised children with SCA with symptoms and signs of infection were recruited for the study using consecutive sampling technique. Sociodemographic and clinical data were obtained. Blood, urine, aspirates, swabs and cerebrospinal fluid samples were collected based on their clinical presentation and subjected to microbiological analysis. RESULTS: A total of 242 patients were studied. The age range was 9 months-15 years, with a mean age of 6.36 years +- 3.75 years. Male-to-female ratio was 1:1.14, with 41.7% of them belonging to low social class. Seventy seven of the 242 had confirmed bacterial infection giving an incidence of bacterial infection in SCA patients of 31.8%. Gram-negative organisms accounted for 64.5% of the isolates and they include Salmonella, Klebsiella, Escherichia coli and Coliforms. However, Staphylococcus aureus (32.9%) was the most frequent microorganism isolated, followed by Salmonella, (20.3%), Klebsiella (12.6%) and Coliforms (12.6%). Amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefixime and gentamicin showed more than 50% activity against the isolated bacterial pathogens while chloramphenicol was found to have low activity against Salmonella. CONCLUSION: High index of suspicion of bacterial infection should be borne in mind of the attending physician when children with SCA present with features of infection. Detailed clinical evaluation and appropriate sample collection for microbiological analysis are recommended. Empirical treatment should be started on SCA patients who have clinical evidence of infection and should be broad enough to cover for common bacterial pathogens.

34889383		Optimizing management of sickle cell disease in patients undergoing surgery.Individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD) are likely to be referred for surgery at some point in their lifetime due to a high incidence of musculoskeletal and intrabdominal complications such as avascular necrosis and gallbladder disease. Preoperative optimization is a multidisciplinary process that involves a hematologist with SCD expertise, an anesthesiologist, and the surgical team. The type and risk classification of the surgery, disease severity, medications, baseline hemoglobin, transfusion history, and history of prior surgical complications are often documented. Clinicians should consider perioperative risk assessment that includes determining the patient's functional status and cardiovascular risk and screening for obstructive sleep apnea. Many patients will require preoperative transfusion to reduce the risk of postoperative complications such as acute chest syndrome and vaso-occlusive pain crises. The hematologist should consider the patient's preoperative transfusion requirements and ensure that the surgical team has an appropriate plan for postoperative observation and management. This often includes follow-up laboratory studies, a postoperative pain management plan, and venous thromboembolism prophylaxis. The transfusion plan should be patient-specific and take into account the SCD genotype, baseline hemoglobin, disease severity, risk classification of the surgery, and history of prior surgical complications. In the intraoperative and postoperative period, dehydration, hypothermia, hypotension, hypoxia, and acidosis should be avoided, and incentive spirometry should be utilized to minimize complications such as acute chest syndrome. In this review we discuss preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative strategies to optimize patients with SCD undergoing surgery.
34879990		Curative therapy for hemoglobinopathies: an International Society for Cell & Gene Therapy Stem Cell Engineering Committee review comparing outcomes, accessibility and cost of ex vivo stem cell gene therapy versus allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.Thalassemia and sickle cell disease (SCD) are the most common monogenic diseases in the world and represent a growing global health burden. Management is limited by a paucity of disease-modifying therapies; however, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and autologous HSCT after genetic modification offer patients a curative option. Allogeneic HSCT is limited by donor selection, morbidity and mortality from transplant conditioning, graft-versus-host disease and graft rejection, whereas significant concerns regarding long-term safety, efficacy and cost limit the broad applicability of gene therapy. Here the authors review current outcomes in allogeneic and autologous HSCT for transfusion-dependent thalassemia and SCD and provide our perspective on issues surrounding accessibility and costs as barriers to offering curative therapy to patients with hereditary hemoglobinopathies.
34276044	associate|@CHEMICAL_Iron|@DISEASE_Hematologic_Diseases ;cause|@CHEMICAL_Iron|@DISEASE_Iron_Overload	A Rare Cause of Chronic Liver Disease Diagnosed by Endoscopic Ultrasound-Guided Liver Biopsy.BACKGROUND Elevated liver enzymes is a common clinical problem with many possible etiologies, yet some are rare and can be missed. Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) may be at risk of liver disease due to recurrent blood transfusion predisposing to viral hepatitis. Furthermore, recurrent transfusions can increase the risk of iron overload, which can create deposits in the liver, eventually resulting in chronic liver disease. Liver biopsy is an essential tool to establish a diagnosis of liver disease in many patients with unexplained elevation of liver enzymes. Recently, endosocpic ultrasound (EUS)-guided liver biopsy has been shown to be safe and effective in obtaining adequate liver tissue. However, the safety and efficacy has not been established in patients with SCD. CASE REPORT A 59-year-old man with SCD and beta-thalassemia minor was evaluated for persistently elevated liver enzymes (mainly cholestatic). He had a background history of treated hepatitis C virus infection. He had multiple blood transfusions in the past for sickle cell crisis. A diagnostic work-up revealed negative viral and autoimmiune serology and no evidence of biliary obstruction on abdominal imaging. The iron profile was elevated, consistent with iron overload. An EUS-guided liver biopsy confirmed a diagnosis hepatic hemosiderosis secondary to long-term blood transfusions. CONCLUSIONS This report emphasizes the importance of careful monitoring of iron levels in patients with hematological conditions requiring long-term blood transfusions. In addition, it highlights the emerging role of EUS-guided liver biopsy as a safe and accurate alternative to percutaneous liver biopsy.
37832631		CRISPR-based precision medicine for hematologic disorders: Advancements, challenges, and prospects.The development of programmable nucleases to introduce defined alterations in genomic sequences has been a powerful tool for precision medicine. While several nucleases such as zinc-finger nucleases (ZFN), transcriptor activator-like effector nucleases (TALEN), and meganucleases have been explored, the advent of CRISPR/Cas9 technology has revolutionized the field of genome engineering. In addition to disease modeling, the CRISPR/Cas9 technology has contributed to safer and more effective treatment strategies for hematologic diseases and personalized T-cell-based therapies. Here we discuss the applications of the CRISPR technology in the treatment of hematologic diseases, their efficacy, and ongoing clinical trials. We examine the obstacles to their successful use and the approaches investigated to overcome these challenges. Finally, we provide our perspectives to improve this genome editing tool for targeted therapies.

Given their high risk for severe COVID-19, it is important to identify those patients that benefit from vaccination. We prospectively quantified serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to spike subunit 1 (S1) antigens during and after 2-dose mRNA-1273 (Spikevax/Moderna) vaccination in hematology patients. Obtaining S1 IgG >= 300 binding antibody units (BAUs)/mL was considered adequate as it represents the lower level of S1 IgG concentration obtained in healthy individuals, and it correlates with potent virus neutralization. Selected patients (n = 723) were severely immunocompromised owing to their disease or treatment thereof. Nevertheless, >50% of patients obtained S1 IgG >= 300 BAUs/mL after 2-dose mRNA-1273. All patients with sickle cell disease or chronic myeloid leukemia obtained adequate antibody concentrations. Around 70% of patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD), multiple myeloma, or untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) obtained S1 IgG >= 300 BAUs/mL. Ruxolitinib or hypomethylating therapy but not high-dose chemotherapy blunted responses in myeloid malignancies. Responses in patients with lymphoma, patients with CLL on ibrutinib, and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell recipients were low. The minimal time interval after autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) to reach adequate concentrations was <2 months for multiple myeloma, 8 months for lymphoma, and 4 to 6 months after allogeneic HCT. Serum IgG4, absolute B- and natural killer-cell number, and number of immunosuppressants predicted S1 IgG >= 300 BAUs/mL. Hematology patients on chemotherapy, shortly after HCT, or with cGVHD should not be precluded from vaccination. This trial was registered at Netherlands Trial Register as #NL9553.
33735176		Descriptive analysis of sickle cell patients living in France: The PHEDRE cross-sectional study.BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) induces chronic haemolytic anaemia and intermittent vaso-occlusion that results in tissue ischaemia causing acute, severe pain episodes that can lead to frequent hospitalizations. These consequences can have repercussions on family, social, school and/or professional life. Here, we present some of the results of the PHEDRE study (Pharmacodependance Et DREpanocytose-drug dependence and sickle-cell disease), which is the largest study of patients with SCD in France. This paper intends to describe characteristics of the French SCD population. We also aimed to assess the impact of the disease on the lives of patients using objective and subjective variables. METHODS: The PHEDRE study was a national multicentric observational study. Adults, adolescents and children with a confirmed SCD diagnosis were included in the study by their referring doctor. Then, they were interviewed by phone about their socioeconomic status, about the impact of the disease on their lives and about their analgesic and psychoactive drug use. RESULTS: The study population consisted of 872 patients (28% were minors). Seventy-two percent of adults were active, and all minors were in school. Many patients presented criteria of severe SCD. Seventy-five percent were homozygous SS, 15% were double heterozygotes SC and 8% were heterozygotes Sbetathal, 87% received specific treatment, 58% were hospitalized at least once for vaso-occlusive crisis in the past 12 months, and the number of analgesic drugs taken averaged 3.8. Seventy-five percent of patients reported academic or professional consequences related to their SCD, and 52% reported social consequences. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of SCD on patients' lives can be significant, nevertheless their social integration seems to be maintained. We highlighted respect of recommendations regarding analgesic treatments and only a few patients used tobacco, alcohol or cannabis.

36043959	treat|@CHEMICAL_Iron|@DISEASE_beta_Thalassemia	Blood transfusion and iron overload in patients with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD): Personal experience and a short update of diabetes mellitus occurrence.The conventional treatment of beta-thalassemia (beta-TM) patients is based on the correction of anemia through regular blood transfusions and iron chelation therapy. However, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains the only currently available technique that has curative potential. Variable frequency and severity of long-term growth and endocrine changes after conventional treatment as well as after HSCT have been reported by different centers. The goal of this mini-review is to summarize and update knowledge about long-term growth and endocrine changes after HSCT in patients with beta-TM in comparison to those occurring in beta-TM patients on conventional treatment. Regular surveillance, early diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up in a multi-disciplinary specialized setting are suggested to optimize the patient's quality of life (www.actabiomedica.it).
34786823		Use of infusion ports in patients with sickle cell disease: Indications and complications.BACKGROUND: Peripheral venous access in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) can become difficult over time due to frequent access and scarring. Infusion ports provide reliable central venous access. Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and infections are complications associated with SCD and infusion ports. METHODS: We performed a 17.5-year single-institution retrospective chart review (January 2000 to July 2018) with literature review regarding use of infusion ports in patients with SCD. RESULTS: We identified 32 patients with infusion ports placed for a total of 63 devices (48 for chronic transfusion [CT] and 15 for poor venous access [PVA], not on CT) for a total of 99,272 catheter days. The mean age at first insertion was 8 years (range 1-20 years). Complications included malfunction, infection, thrombosis, difficult access, and pain over infusion port site. The rate of infection was 0.2 per 1000 catheter days. Thrombosis was identified in three devices (5%) in three patients (9%), with a rate of 0.03 per 1000 catheter days. There was no difference in complications by site in either the left or right subclavian vein (p = 1). The rate of premature removal was 0.36 per 1000 catheter days, which was higher among patients with infusion ports solely for PVA (0.87 per 1000 catheter days) compared with those placed for CT (0.29 per 1000 catheter days). CONCLUSION: Infusion ports in patients with SCD was associated with low rates of thrombosis, infection, and malfunction, and may be considered as an alternative to frequent intravenous access, especially in patients requiring CT.
36598517	associate|@DISEASE_Anemia_Hemolytic|@GENE_HP ;cause|@CHEMICAL_Bilirubin|@DISEASE_Anemia_Hemolytic	[Hemolytic anemia in emergency and intensive care medicine].Hemolytic anemia (HA) is caused by premature destruction or degradation of red blood cells (RBC). Low hemoglobin, suppressed haptoglobin, reticulocytosis as well as an elevation of lactate dehydrogenase and bilirubin are common laboratory findings in HA. Intracorpuscular HA due to defects of the RBC themselves are distinguished from extracorpuscular HA due to external factors. Severity of symptoms such as fatigue and dyspnea depend on the degree of anemia. For optimal treatment of HA, a detailed evaluation of the patient history (including hereditary RBC defects, B symptoms and travel history) is necessary. Additional diagnostics (hematological diagnostics, infectious disease diagnostics, immunological diagnostics, computed tomography [CT] scan) should be performed according to the patient's individual requirements. Treatment of HA depends on the etiology. If HA is immune-mediated, immunosuppressive therapy is indicated, whereas HA due to infections usually improves after adequate anti-infective therapy. Anti-infective therapy should also be considered in patients with sickle cell disease who present with severe HA. In general, HA can be treated effectively in most cases.
33666363		Persistence of CRISPR/Cas9 gene edited hematopoietic stem cells following transplantation: A systematic review and meta-analysis of preclinical studies.Gene editing blood-derived cells is an attractive approach to cure selected monogenic diseases but remains experimental. A systematic search of preclinical controlled studies is needed to determine the persistence of edited cells following reinfusion. All studies identified in our systematic search (to 20 October 2020) examining the use of CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing in blood-derived cells for transplantation were included. Meta-analysis was performed to determine the engraftment and persistence of gene edited cells. A total of 3538 preclinical studies were identified with 15 published articles meeting eligibility for meta-analysis. These in vivo animal studies examined editing of hemoglobin to correct sickle cell disease (eight studies), inducing resistance to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (two studies), and six other monogenic disorders (single studies). CRISPR-Cas9 edited hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells demonstrated equivalent early engraftment compared to controls in meta-analysis but persistence of gene-edited cells was reduced at later time points and in secondary transplant recipients. Subgroup analysis in studies targeting the hemoglobin gene revealed a significant reduction in the persistence of gene-edited cells whether homology-directed repair or nonhomologous end-joining were used. No adverse side effects were reported. Significant heterogeneity in study design and outcome reporting was observed and the potential for bias was identified in all studies. CRISPR-Cas9 gene edited cells engraft similarly to unedited hematopoietic cells. Persistence of gene edited cells, however, remains a challenge and improved methods of targeting hematopoietic stem cells are needed. Reducing heterogeneity and potential risk of bias will hasten the development of informative clinical trials.
35441446	treat|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell	No child left behind: Building a comprehensive sickle cell disease care oasis in the Lake County, Indiana care desert.BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) leads to end-organ damage and shortened life expectancy. The second highest incidence of SCD in Indiana is in Lake County, but until 2017, there was no SCD expert within 65 miles. The Indiana Hemophilia and Thrombosis Center (IHTC) developed the Sickle Care coordination OutReach and Education (SCORE) program in 2017 to bring high-quality, guideline-based care to children with SCD. PROCEDURE: The St. Vincent IRB deemed this retrospective analysis of SCORE clinic care from 2017 to 2020 exempt. Data on the number of transcranial Dopplers (TCD) performed, HU dosing escalation, and vaccine rates were collected along with the number of school and home visits completed. RESULTS: Fifty-three children, adolescents, and young adults completed 288 SCORE clinic visits during the study period; over 75% completed at least three clinic visits. Mean HU dose increased significantly with SCORE clinic care. TCD screening rates increased every year starting in 2018 through 2020 when we added local care coordination. One hundred seventy-three vaccines were administered in SCORE outreach clinics. The PPSV23 vaccines had a 100% acceptance rate, and seasonal influenza had a 75.8% acceptance rate. CONCLUSION: Access to care coordination services and local hematology specialty care alleviates barriers to care and enables comprehensive SCD care delivery to children in need. Prior to the establishment of the SCORE clinic, 75% of children in Lake County were not receiving recommended stroke screening. The SCORE clinic model demonstrates feasibility and impact when delivering on the promise of high-quality care for children with SCD.
35941221		What is the effectiveness of surgical and non-surgical therapies in the treatment of ischemic priapism in patients with sickle cell disease? A systematic review by the EAU Sexual and Reproductive Health Guidelines Panel.Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited hemoglobin disorder characterized by the occlusion of small blood vessels by sickle-shaped red blood cells. SCD is associated with a number of complications, including ischemic priapism. While SCD accounts for at least one-third of all priapism cases, no definitive treatment strategy has been established to specifically treat patients with SC priapism. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the efficacy and safety of contemporary treatment modalities for acute and stuttering ischemic priapism associated with SCD. The primary outcome measures were defined as resolution of acute priapism (detumescence) and complete response of stuttering priapism, while the primary harm outcome was as sexual dysfunction. The protocol for the review has been registered (PROSPERO Nr: CRD42020182001), and a systematic search of Medline, Embase, and Cochrane controlled trials databases was performed. Three trials with 41 observational studies met the criteria for inclusion in this review. None of the trials assessed detumescence, as a primary outcome. All of the trials reported a complete response of stuttering priapism; however, the certainty of the evidence was low. It is clear that assessing the effectiveness of specific interventions for priapism in SCD, well-designed, adequately-powered, multicenter trials are strongly required.
34463318		The Histopathologic Features of Sickle Cell Hepatopathy: A Multi-Institutional Study.OBJECTIVES: Recent data on hepatic histopathology in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) are lacking. METHODS: A total of 39 liver biopsies from SCD patients from 4 medical institutes were systematically evaluated. RESULTS: The average age of patients was 27 years; 23 were female. The majority of the patients had hemoglobin SS (33), 3 had hemoglobin SC, and 3 sickle cell trait. Elevated liver functional tests and evaluation for cirrhosis were the main indications for biopsy. At the time of biopsy, most had elevated liver transaminases or hepatomegaly. The most common histopathologic abnormalities were Kupffer cell erythrophagocytosis (76.9%), hemosiderosis (74.4%), sinusoidal dilatation (71.8%), and intrasinusoidal sickled red cells (69.3%). Portal inflammation, lobular inflammation, and bile duct injury were mild to minimal and present in a minority of cases. Advanced fibrosis was present in 28.2% of the cases. CONCLUSIONS: The typical histopathologic features seen in patients with SCD include Kupffer cell erythrophagocytosis, hemosiderosis, sinusoidal dilatation, and intrasinusoidal sickled red cells in a pauci-inflammatory or uninflamed background. Necrosis is less common than reported in older literature. Pathologists should be aware that significant portal and lobular inflammation, interface activity, and bile duct injury are unusual and may be suggestive of other etiologies.
37340519		Indian sickle cell disease registry for surveillance and patient management: Development and implementation.In India, sickle cell disease (SCD) predominantly occurs in indigenous (tribal) people, who are about 104 million. However, screening and diagnosis seldom happen. This situation necessitates developing a comprehensive SCD care model, including a registry. This paper describes the development and implementation of the Indian SCD registry (ISCDR) in six tribal-dominated districts of India. The ISCDR was created in two components-(i) an Android-based mobile/tablet application, (ii) a dashboard/admin panel for patients' data management and retrieval. Data capture involves two electronic case report forms (CRF), that is, the primary form (CRF-1) and the repeat visit form (CRF-2). CRF-1 is completed as soon as the patient is found positive and captures the patient's information, including medical history, diagnosis, symptoms, precipitating factors, hospitalisation history and treatment received. Issues related to quality, security and data-sharing were addressed. After the screening system was functional, ISCDR was initiated. In 12 months, data of 324 SCD patients and 1771 carriers were entered. The study demonstrates the feasibility of establishing an SCD registry in India. It collects systematic longitudinal data on SCD patients, which are essential for programme planning and management. Further, it is feasible to scale up and integrate with other health management databases.
35158150		Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Angiography in Children with Sickle Cell Anaemia in Uganda in a Cross-Sectional Sample.OBJECTIVE: Children with sickle cell anaemia (SCA) are highly susceptible to cerebrovascular injury. We performed brain magnetic resonance imaging and angiography (MRI-MRA) in Ugandan children with SCA to identify structural cerebrovascular abnormalities and examine their relationship to standardized clinical assessments. METHODS: A sub-sample (n=81) was selected from a cross-sectional study of children attending SCA clinic, including 52 (64.2%) with and 29 (35.8%) without clinically detected abnormalities. Clinical evaluation included assessment for prior stroke, cognitive testing and cerebral arterial transcranial doppler (TCD) flow velocity. MRI-MRA scans were interpreted by at least two neuroradiologists. RESULTS: Mean age was 6.5+-2.7 years, with 39 (48.1%) female. Mean haemoglobin was 7.3+-0.9 g/dl. Overall, 13 (16.0%) were malnourished. Infarcts and/or stenoses were detected in 55 (67.9%) participants, with stenoses primarily in the anterior circulation. Infarcts were seen in those with normal 17/29 (58.6%) or abnormal 34/52 (65.4%) clinical testing (p=0.181). Neither abnormal MRI nor MRA was associated with age, sex, haemoglobin, or malnutrition. Abnormal MRA was highly associated with infarcts (p<0.0001). Participants with abnormal imaging had two-fold higher proportion of stroke on exam and/or impaired cognition. Stroke on exam was strongly associated with an imaging abnormality after adjusting for age, sex, malnutrition, and haemoglobin (OR 11.8, 95%CI 1.87-74.2). CONCLUSION: Over half of these SCA children had cerebrovascular infarcts and/or arterial stenoses. Cerebrovascular disease was frequently undetectable by clinical assessments. While rarely available in under-resourced settings, MRI-MRA brain imaging is an important tool for defining SCA cerebrovascular disease and for assessing impact of clinical intervention trials.
33674866		Pain Experiences of Adults With Sickle Cell Disease and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation: A Qualitative Study.OBJECTIVE: Despite increasing use of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for adults with sickle cell disease (SCD), little is known about pain management experiences throughout this process. The objective of this study was to explore patients' experiences with pain and pain management during and after HSCT for SCD. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative interview study with 10 patients who underwent HSCT for SCD. We transcribed interviews verbatim and inductively identified codes. We used thematic analysis alongside a constant comparative method to develop and refine a codebook that aided in the identification of themes. RESULTS: Four key themes emerged. (1) The pain trajectory: patients described a fluctuating course of pain during HSCT, which often extended long afterwards and impacted all aspects of life, particularly affected by pre-HSCT experiences; (2) The role of opioids-a double-edged sword: patients described opioids as reducing pain but insufficiently to balance significant adverse effects and burden; (3) Patient-centered decision making in pain management: patients described insufficient agency in decisions about opioid use and weaning; and (4) Consequences of health-related stigma: patients described experiences with stigma, mainly related to opioid use and weaning, as similar to pre-HSCT. CONCLUSIONS: From the perspective of patients who have undergone HSCT for SCD, clinicians should use a patient-centered approach, integrating non-opioid approaches into pain management, particularly psychosocial support. As transplant for SCD becomes increasingly available, incorporating patient perspectives may improve health care delivery and overall patient experiences.
36455867		Opening Pandora's box: abnormal genetic carrier screening and need for lifetime follow-up.OBJECTIVE: Expanded carrier screening (ECS) is rising in popularity because of its application in a diverse population, its decreasing cost, and efficiency.1 However, it has traditionally been used to assess fetal risk. The next generation sequencing ECS panel offered at our academic medical center consists of 283 genes associated with hereditary disorders. Of those, 20 (7.1%) are autosomal recessive conditions, notable for variable expression of the clinical phenotype in heterozygous carriers, which may increase maternal risk for malignancy, bleeding, cardiovascular, or rheumatologic disease. Another 21 (7.4%) are X-linked conditions. We aimed to evaluate the prevalence of variants that have a potential for maternal phenotypic expression and whether identification of specific variants prompted patients to pursue further care in our health system, namely comprehensive genetic counseling and further healthcare consults when recommended. STUDY DESIGN: An institutional review board-approved descriptive retrospective cohort study was performed in a New York City academic medical center at which reproductive aged women were offered universal ECS from 2018 to 2021 by their provider, inclusive of obstetrician-gynecologists, maternal-fetal medicine physicians, and genetic counselors. Pretest counseling was performed by the ordering provider. Patients found to carry mutations with the potential for maternal phenotypic expression were contacted by genetic counselors regarding their clinical risks. In addition, patients who were carriers for factor XI deficiency, Bernard Soulier syndrome, ataxia telangectesia, fumarase deficiency, Nijmegen breakage syndrome, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and familial hypercholesterolemia were advised to seek specialized healthcare pertaining to their clinical risk. The genetic counseling summary was placed in the electronic medical records (EMRs) so that the primary provider could view the findings. Through our EMRs, we evaluated the rates of healthcare uptake among these patients for at least 1 year after delivery. RESULTS: In total, 168 of 1184 (14.2%) patients were identified as carriers of mutations with a potential for maternal phenotypic expression. Of these, 156 (93%) were pregnant and 12 (7%) were preconception. Of those patients, 143 (85%) were carriers of autosomal recessive traits (Figure 1), whereas 22 of 168 (13%) patients were carriers of X-linked conditions (Figure 2) and 3 of 168 (2%) patients carried both autosomal recessive traits and X-linked conditions. Of these carriers, 132 of 168 (78.6%) patients underwent genetic counseling. The most common heterozygous mutations were sickle cell trait (25.6%), thalassemia (alpha and/or beta) trait (14.2%), factor XI deficiency (4.7%), dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (4.2%), and Alport syndrome (4.1%). Two patients were diagnosed as homozygous carriers of nonclassical congenital adrenal hyperplasia. During the study period, 23 of 168 (13.6%) patients were heterozygous for specific pathogenic variants (inclusive of factor XI, Bernard Soulier syndrome, ataxia telangectesia, fumarase deficiency, Nijmegen breakage syndrome, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and familial hypercholesterolemia) and were advised to seek specialized healthcare pertaining to these findings. Of these, 20 (87.0%) received genetic counseling with standardized recommendations, however, only 4 of 23 (17%) patients pursued the recommended referrals during our study period. CONCLUSION: This study described the follow-up rates among patients identified as carriers of conditions with the potential for maternal phenotypic expression using ECS. We observed that 14.2% of patients who underwent ECS were identified as carriers of genetic mutations with the potential for maternal phenotypic expression, and of the 23 who were recommended specific care because a pathogenic variant was identified, only 17.4% of patients followed the recommendations. We believe that as ECS implementation becomes widespread, more maternal carriers with clinical risk to themselves will be identified. Therefore, as we open this Pandora's box, the burden of counseling and follow-up must be addressed.
37737026		Prevalence of Pediatric Masked Hypertension and Risk of Subclinical Cardiovascular Outcomes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.Masked hypertension (MH) occurs when office blood pressure is normal, but hypertension is confirmed using out-of-office blood pressure measures. Hypertension is a risk factor for subclinical cardiovascular outcomes, including left ventricular hypertrophy, increased left ventricular mass index, carotid intima media thickness, and pulse wave velocity. However, the risk factors for ambulatory blood pressure monitoring defined MH and its association with subclinical cardiovascular outcomes are unclear. A systematic literature search on 9 databases included English publications from 1974 to 2023. Pediatric MH prevalence was stratified by disease comorbidities and compared with the general pediatric population. We also compared the prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy, and mean differences in left ventricular mass index, carotid intima media thickness, and pulse wave velocity between MH versus normotensive pediatric patients. Of 2199 screened studies, 136 studies (n=28 612; ages 4-25 years) were included. The prevalence of MH in the general pediatric population was 10.4% (95% CI, 8.00-12.80). Compared with the general pediatric population, the risk ratio (RR) of MH was significantly greater in children with coarctation of the aorta (RR, 1.91), solid-organ or stem-cell transplant (RR, 2.34), chronic kidney disease (RR, 2.44), and sickle cell disease (RR, 1.33). MH patients had increased risk of subclinical cardiovascular outcomes compared with normotensive patients, including higher left ventricular mass index (mean difference, 3.86 g/m2.7 [95% CI, 2.51-5.22]), left ventricular hypertrophy (odds ratio, 2.44 [95% CI, 1.50-3.96]), and higher pulse wave velocity (mean difference, 0.30 m/s [95% CI, 0.14-0.45]). The prevalence of MH is significantly elevated among children with various comorbidities. Children with MH have evidence of subclinical cardiovascular outcomes, which increases their risk of long-term cardiovascular disease.
35360062		Testicular Tissue Banking for Fertility Preservation in Young Boys: Which Patients Should Be Included?Due to the growing number of young patients at risk of germ cell loss, there is a need to preserve spermatogonial stem cells for patients who are not able to bank spermatozoa. Worldwide, more and more clinics are implementing testicular tissue (TT) banking programs, making it a novel, yet indispensable, discipline in the field of fertility preservation. Previously, TT cryopreservation was predominantly offered to young cancer patients before starting gonadotoxic chemo- or radiotherapy. Nowadays, most centers also bank TT from patients with non-malignant conditions who need gonadotoxic conditioning therapy prior to hematopoietic stem cell (HSCT) or bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Additionally, some centers include patients who suffer from genetic or developmental disorders associated with prepubertal germ cell loss or patients who already had a previous round of chemo- or radiotherapy. It is important to note that the surgical removal of TT is an invasive procedure. Moreover, TT cryopreservation is still considered experimental as restoration methods are not yet clinically available. For this reason, TT banking should preferably only be offered to patients who are at significant risk of becoming infertile. In our view, TT cryopreservation is recommended for young cancer patients in need of high-risk chemo- and/or radiotherapy, regardless of previous low-risk treatment. Likewise, TT banking is advised for patients with non-malignant disorders such as sickle cell disease, beta-thalassemia, and bone marrow failure, who need high-risk conditioning therapy before HSCT/BMT. TT retrieval during orchidopexy is also proposed for patients with bilateral cryptorchidism. Since patients with a medium- to low-risk treatment generally maintain their fertility, TT banking is not advised for this group. Also for Klinefelter patients, TT banking is not recommended as it does not give better outcomes than a testicular sperm extraction later in life.

35788087		Is Severity Score Associated With Indication for Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation in Individuals With Sickle Cell Anemia?Manifestations of sickle cell disease (SCD) begin early in childhood and cause morbidity and decreased life expectancy. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is curative but associated with risk of mortality attributable to the transplant. This risk should be counterbalanced with SCD morbidity and mortality. A severity score using a Bayesian network model was previously validated to predict the risk of death in adult individuals with SCD. The objective of this study is to calculate the severity scores of participants in a multicenter cohort of Brazilians with SCD, using a previously published Bayesian network-derived score, associated with risk of death and then compare the severity scores between participants with and without an indication for HSCT as defined by the Brazilian Ministry of Health (MoH) criteria. This is an observational, retrospective study. We analyzed 2063 individuals with sickle cell anemia from the Recipient Epidemiology and Donor Evaluation Study-III Brazil SCD cohort and applied a Bayesian network-derived score to compare candidates and non-candidates for HSCT according to the Brazilian MoH transplant criteria. Classical statistical methods were used to analyze data and make comparisons. We compared severity scores between cohort members with (n = 431) and without (n = 1632) HSCT indications according to Brazilian MoH. Scores were not different in adult participants with >=1 HSCT indication when compared to those with no indication (mean 0.342 versus 0.292; median 0.194 versus 0.183, P = .354) and receiver operating characteristic curves did not demonstrate an obvious threshold to differentiate participants with or without HSCT indications. Severity score may predict risk of death but does not differentiate HSCT candidates. Current indications should be evaluated to ensure that patients with more severe disease who might benefit from HSCT are appropriately identified.

36240296		Reduction in vaso-occlusive events following stem cell transplantation in patients with sickle cell disease.Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is potentially curative for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Patients with stable donor engraftment after allogeneic HSCT generally do not experience SCD-related complications; however, there are no published data specifically reporting the change in vaso-occlusive events (VOE) after HSCT. Data regarding the number of VOEs requiring medical attention in the 2 years before allogeneic HSCT were compared with the number of VOEs in the 2 years (0-12 months and 12-24 months) after allogeneic HSCT in patients with SCD. One-hundred sixty-three patients with SCD underwent allogeneic HSCT between 2005 and 2019. The average age at the time of HSCT was 21 years (range, 7 months - 64 years). Most patients underwent nonmyeloablative conditioning (75% [N = 123]) and had a matched sibling donor (72% [N = 118]). The mean number of VOEs was reduced from 5.6 (range, 0-52) in the 2 years before HSCT to 0.9 (range, 0-12) in the 2 years after HSCT (P < .001). Among the post-HSCT events, VOE was more frequent during the first 12 months (0.8 [range, 0-12]) than at 12 to 24 months after HSCT (0.1 [range, 0-8) (P < .001)). In patients who had graft rejection (12%, N = 20), VOEs were reduced from 6.6 (range, 0-24) before HSCT to 1.1 (range, 0-6) and 0.8 (range, 0-8) at 0 to 12 months and 12 to 24 months after HSCT, respectively (P < .001). VOEs requiring medical care were significantly reduced after allogeneic HSCT for patients with SCD. These data will inform the development of novel autologous HSCT gene therapy approaches.
38010293		Defining curative endpoints for sickle cell disease in the era of gene therapy and gene editing.A growing number of gene therapy- and gene editing-based treatments for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) are entering clinical trials. These treatments, designed to target the underlying cause of SCD, have the potential to provide functional cures, which until now were possible only through allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. However, as these novel approaches advance from early- to late-stage clinical trials, it is essential to identify physiologically and clinically relevant endpoints that can demonstrate the achievement of a functional cure for SCD. Here, we present an overview of the pathophysiology of SCD and current treatment options, review ongoing SCD clinical trials using gene therapy or gene editing approaches, and identify the most relevant endpoints for demonstrating the attainment of a functional cure for SCD.

Patients with SCD frequently report inadequate pain treatment in the ED, resulting in hospital admission. A retrospective analysis was conducted to assess a quality improvement project to standardize ED care for patients presenting with pain associated with SCD. METHODS: A 3-year prospective quality improvement initiative was performed. Our multidisciplinary team of providers implemented an ED order set in 2019 to improve care and provide adequate analgesia management. Our primary outcome was the overall hospital admission rate for patients after the intervention. Secondary outcome measures included ED disposition, rate of return to the ED within 72 hours, ED pain scores at admission and discharge, ED treatment time, in-patient length of stay, non-opioid medication use, and opioid medication use. RESULTS: There was an overall 67% reduction in the hospital admission rate after implementation of the order set (P = 0.005) and a significant decrease in the percentage admission rate month over month (P = 0.047). Time to the first non-opioid analgesic decreased by 71 minutes (P > 0.001), and there was no change in time to the first opioid medication. The rate of return to the ED within 72 hours remained unchanged (7.0% vs 7.1%) (P = 0.93), and the ED elopement rate remained unchanged (1.3% vs 1.85%) (P = 0.93). After the implementation, there were significant increases in the prescribing of orally administered acetaminophen (7%), celecoxib (1.2%), and tizanidine (12.5%) and intravenous ketamine (30.5%) and ketorolac (27%). ED pain scores at discharge were unchanged for both hospital-admitted (7.12 vs 7.08) (P = 0.93) and non-admitted (5.51 vs 6.11) (P = 0.27) patients. The resulting potential cost reduction was determined to be $193,440 during the 12-month observation period, with the mean cost per visit decreasing by $792. CONCLUSIONS: Use of a standardized and multimodal ED order set reduced hospital admission rates and the timeliness of analgesia without negatively impacting patients' pain.

The main complications leading to hospitalizations include vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs) and acute chest syndrome (ACS). Therefore, the main objective of this paper was to identify and evaluate evidence-based management and prevention of VOCs in patients with SCD. A literature search of PubMed, Medline Cochrane and Google Scholar database (January 1985 to April 2020) was performed using the following search terms "vaso-occlusive crises", "sickle cell disease", "hydroxyurea", "L-glutamine", "voxelotor", "crizanlizumab", "treatment" and "prevention" as well as a combination of these terms. All English-language interventional studies assessing the efficacy and safety of VOC outcomes were evaluated. Literature was excluded if published in a language other than English or if it was a review article. A total of 69 articles were identified and there were 7 articles that met the search criteria. Majority of the studies focused on mean and median annual rates of VOCs as primary outcomes while median time to first sickle cell crises, median rates of hospitalizations etc were evaluated as secondary outcomes. After reviewing the literature, many patients with VOCs will still benefit from hydroxyurea therapy since long term efficacy data and cost is still a concern for the newer agents including L-glutamine, voxelotor and crizanlizumab. Other factors such as cost or compliance may also be taken into consideration when making recommendations for therapy.
37458568		Return visit rates after an emergency department discharge for children with sickle cell pain episodes.BACKGROUND: High return visit rates after hospitalization for people with sickle cell disease (SCD) have been previously established. Due to a lack of multicenter emergency department (ED) return visit rate data, the return visit rate following ED discharge for pediatric SCD pain treatment is currently unknown. PROCEDURE: A seven-site retrospective cohort study of discharged ED visits for pain by children with SCD was conducted using the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network Registry. Visits between January 2017 and November 2021 were identified using previously validated criteria. The primary outcome was the 14-day return visit rate, with 3- and 7-day rates also calculated. Modified Poisson regression was used to analyze associations for age, sex, initial hospitalization rate, and a visit during the COVID-19 pandemic with return visit rates. RESULTS: Of 2548 eligible ED visits, approximately 52% were patients less than 12 years old, 50% were female, and over 95% were non-Hispanic Black. The overall 14-day return visit rate was 29.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 27.4%-30.9%; site range 22.7%-31.7%); the 7- and 3-day return visit rates were 23.0% (95% CI: 21.3%-24.6%) and 16.7% (95% CI: 15.3%-18.2%), respectively. Younger children had slightly lower 14-day return visit rates (27.3% vs. 31.1%); there were no associations for site hospitalization rate, sex, and a visit occurring during the pandemic with 14-day returns. CONCLUSION: Nearly 30% of ED discharged visits after SCD pain treatment had a return visit within 14 days. Increased efforts are needed to identify causes for high ED return visit rates and ensure optimal ED and post-ED care.
35194011		Sickle Cell Trait and SARS-CoV-2-Induced Rhabdomyolysis: A Case Report.BACKGROUND Rhabdomyolysis is a syndrome characterized by muscle necrosis and the subsequent release of intracellular muscle constituents into the bloodstream. Although the specific cause is frequently evident from the history or from the immediate events, such as a trauma, extraordinary physical exertion, or a recent infection, sometimes there are hidden risk factors that have to be identified. For instance, individuals with sickle cell trait (SCT) have been reported to be at increased risk for rare conditions, including rhabdomyolysis. Moreover, there have been a few case reports of SARS-CoV-2 infection-related rhabdomyolysis. CASE REPORT We present a case of a patient affected by unknown SCT and admitted with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, who suffered non-traumatic non-exertional rhabdomyolysis leading to acute kidney injury (AKI), requiring acute hemodialysis (HD). The patients underwent 13 dialysis session, of which 12 were carried out using an HFR-Supra H dialyzer. He underwent kidney biopsy, where rhabdomyolysis injury was ascertained. No viral traces were found on kidney biopsy samples. The muscle biopsy showed the presence of an "open nucleolus" in the muscle cell, which was consistent with virus-infected cells. After 40 days in the hospital, his serum creatinine was 1.62 mg/dL and CPK and Myoglobin were 188 U/L and 168 ng/mL, respectively; therefore, the patient was discharged. CONCLUSIONS SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in severe rhabdomyolysis with AKI requiring acute HD. Since SARS-CoV-2 infection can trigger sickle-related complications like rhabdomyolysis, the presence of SCT needs to be ascertained in African patients.
37952647	associate|@CHEMICAL_titanium_silicide|@DISEASE_Fibrosis	Improvement in cardiac morphology demonstrated by CMR and echo after haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplant in adults with sickle cell disease.Cardiopulmonary complications account for approximately 40% of deaths in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Diffuse myocardial fibrosis, elevated tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity (TRV) and iron overload are all associated with early mortality. While HLA-matched sibling hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) offers a potential cure, fewer than 20% of patients have a suitable donor. Haploidentical HCT allows for an increased donor pool and has recently demonstrated improved safety and efficacy. Our group has reported improved cardiac morphology via echocardiography at one year after HCT. Herein, we describe the first use of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR), the gold standard for measuring volume, mass, and ventricular function, to evaluate changes in cardiac morphology post-HCT in adults with SCD. We analyzed baseline and 1-year data from 12 adults with SCD who received nonmyeloablative haploidentical peripheral blood HCT at the NIH. Patients underwent non-contrast CMR at 3T, echocardiography, and laboratory studies. One year after HCT, patients showed marked improvement in cardiac chamber morphology by CMR, including left ventricular (LV) mass and volume (70.2 to 60.1 g/m2, p = 0.02; 114.5 to 90.6 mL/m2, p = 0.001). Furthermore, mean TRV normalized by 1 year, suggesting that HCT may offer a survival benefit. Fewer patients had pathologically prolonged native myocardial T1 times, an indirect marker of myocardial fibrosis at 1 year; these data showed a trend toward significance. In this small sample, CMR was very sensitive in detecting cardiac mass and volume changes after HCT and provided complementary information to echocardiography. Notably, post-HCT improvement in cardiac parameters can be attributed only in part to the resolution of anemia; further studies are required to determine the role of myocardial fibrosis reversal, improved blood flow, and survival impact after HCT for SCD.
36089470	treat|@CHEMICAL_Cyclophosphamide|@DISEASE_Graft_vs_Host_Disease	Haploidentical stem cell transplantation for patients with sickle cell disease: current status.For patients with high-risk sickle cell disease (SCD) without any available matched sibling or unrelated donor, haploidentical stem cell transplantation (haploHCT) expands the availability of this life-saving intervention to nearly all patients who may benefit from HCT. The greatest challenge in haploHCT has been the significant risk of graft failure. Developing a treatment modality which sustains engraftment without increasing the incidence of debilitating graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) remains the ultimate goal. A number of modifications have been explored to overcome the high incidence of graft rejection and severe GvHD including: (1) ex-vivo T-cell depletion (via CD34+ selection, CD3+/CD19+, or TCRalphabeta+/CD19+ depletion), and (2) in vivo T-cell depletion using unmanipulated grafts followed by post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) for GvHD prophylaxis. Furthermore, the presence of donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies (DSA) has been associated with an increased risk of both graft failure and poor graft function. Several approaches for desensitization ameliorate this risk when a suitable donor without DSA is not available. In addition to advances in supportive care, the recent demonstration that stable mixed chimerism post-HCT sufficiently sustains symptom-free status has opened the door for less toxic treatment approaches yielding excellent survival outcomes. Though late effects remain uncertain, the goal of finding the least toxic conditioning regimen while providing the highest rate of donor engraftment draws closer within reach. In this review, the authors aim to present the latest findings, challenges, and treatment modalities of this life-saving modality.
35583381		Assessment of donor cell engraftment after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for sickle cell disease: A review of current and future methods.Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only established curative treatment for sickle cell disease (SCD), a debilitating red blood cell (RBC) disorder with significant prevalence worldwide. Accurate assessment of RBC engraftment following HSCT is essential to evaluate the status of the graft and can enable early intervention to treat or prevent graft rejection. Currently, chimerism measurement is performed on whole blood samples, which mainly reflect white blood cell (WBC) chimerism. This approach has limitations in assessing engraftment in patients with SCD because RBCs engraft non-linearly with WBCs. Direct measures of RBC chimerism exist but are not routinely used. In this review, we critically examine the current methodologies for assessing donor engraftment; highlight the limitations of these different methods, and present emerging and novel technologies with the potential to improve clinical monitoring of RBC engraftment post-HSCT for SCD. Promising alternative methodologies include RBC-specific flow cytometry, RBC-specific RNA analysis, and quantification of plasma cell-free DNA derived specifically from nucleated RBCs.
33785253		Treatment of aseptic osteonecrosis of the femoral head: Historical aspects.The treatment of aseptic osteonecrosis (ON) of the femoral head has been the subject of numerous therapeutic and surgical proposals due to the absence of medical treatment with proven efficacy. For many years, the goal of surgical treatment was to avoid total hip replacement (THR) with uncertain survival in patients considered too young (30-50 years) for this procedure. Numerous conservative treatments were thus proposed: core decompression with numerous variants, non-vascularized and vascularized bone grafts, intertrochanteric and rotational transtrochanteric osteotomies, cementing. The lack of a common classification and a lack of knowledge of natural history complicated the interpretation of the results for a long time. Nevertheless, it appeared that these treatments were effective only in the very early stages and among these in the limited ONs, medial rather than central and especially lateral, with discrepancies according to etiologies apart from sickle cell disease recognized by all as being pejorative. For the same reason, partial arthroplasties have been attempted and abandoned in turn: femoral head total and partial resurfacing and femoral prosthesis. The most recent advances are stem-cell-enhanced core decompression and progress in total arthroplasty, whose reliability has made it possible to extend the indications to increasingly younger patients seeking treatment with guaranteed or near-guaranteed efficacy. Most of the other interventions have disappeared or almost disappeared because of their lack of effectiveness especially in extensive and post-fracture ONs, sometimes because of their complexity and the length of their post-operative management, and also because they complicate and penalize a future total arthroplasty. This argues for early detection of ON at an early stage where the "head can be saved" by stem cell augmented core decompression, a minimally invasive treatment that leaves the chances of success of a THR intact.
37290934		Outcomes of COVID-19 hospitalizations in patients with sickle cell disease: A nationwide analysis.INTRODUCTION: There is a paucity of data on the outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) in the United States. We examined the outcomes of patients with COVID-19 and SCD. METHODS: We utilized the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) to identify the data of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and SCD in 2020 using the International Classification of Disease, Tenth Revision codes. In-hospital outcomes (invasive mechanical ventilation and mortality) were compared between SCD and non-SCD groups. RESULTS: Of the 1 057 550 COVID-19 hospitalizations, 2870 (0.3%) had SCD. The median age of the SCD group was 42 (IQR: 31) vs. 66 (IQR: 23) in the non-SCD group (p < .0001). Patients with SCD were likely to be females (62.02% vs. 37.98%, p < .0001), Blacks (87.81% vs. 12.19%, p < .0001), and in the lowest income quartile (50.62% vs. 11.15%, p < .0001). There was no difference in the outcomes between the two groups. There were increased odds of invasive mechanical ventilation and in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 in Asians, Hispanics, Native Americans, and Blacks (except for in-hospital mortality) compared to Whites. CONCLUSION: In-hospital mortality and invasive mechanical ventilation outcomes in SCD are comparable to that in non-SCD patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
34904454		Simultaneous visible light optical coherence tomography and near infrared OCT angiography in retinal pathologies: A case study.A dual-channel optical coherence tomography system with wavelengths in the visible and near-infrared light ranges can provide both structural and functional information for retinal microvasculature simultaneously. We applied this integrated system in an ongoing clinical study of patients with various retinal pathologies. Here, we present case study results of patients with diabetic retinopathy, central retinal vein occlusion, and sickle cell retinopathy compared to a healthy subject. For the first time, this comparison validates the system's ability to detect structural anomalies in both en face and B-scan images with simultaneous retinal optical coherence tomography angiography and measurement of sO2 in parafoveal vessels that are around 20-30 microm in diameter. This integrated system represents a powerful instrument with potentially far-reaching clinical implications for the early detection and diagnosis of retinal vascular diseases.
35947137		Structural connectivity mediates the relationship between blood oxygenation and cognitive function in sickle cell anemia.In sickle cell disease (SCD), the relative importance of reduced hemoglobin and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) on brain structure remains uncertain. We applied graph-theoretical analysis to diffusion MRI data to investigate the effect of structural brain connectivity on cognitive function, alongside presence/absence, number and volume of silent cerebral infarction (SCI). In patients, we investigated the relationships between network properties, blood oxygenation and cognition (working memory, WMI, and processing speed, PSI, indices). Based on streamline counts and fractional anisotropy (FA), we identified a subnetwork with weakened connectivity in 92 SCA patients (49 males; 8.0-38.8 years), compared to 54 non-SCA controls (22 males; 6.7-30.6 years). Multiple regression analyses showed a significant effect of hemoglobin on full-network edge density (p<0.05), and of peripheral SpO2 on streamline-weighted subnetwork efficiency (p<0.01). There were effects of FA-weighted full-network and subnetwork efficiency on WMI (both p<0.05), and of streamline-weighted subnetwork efficiency on PSI (p=0.05) but no effects on SCI. Streamline-weighted efficiency was progressively lower with lower SpO2, with a downstream effect on PSI. In path analysis, indirect relationships between blood oxygenation and cognition, mediated by network properties, were better supported than direct alternatives, with an indirect relationship between low SpO2 and PSI in patients, mediated by structural connectivity efficiency in a subnetwork of the brain differing from controls. Our findings are consistent with the notion that cognitive impairment is primarily mediated by hypoxic-ischemic effects on normal-appearing white matter, and highlight the utility of network-based methods in providing biomarkers of cognitive dysfunction in SCA patients.
35087158	associate|@DISEASE_beta_Thalassemia|@GENE_HBB ;associate|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell|@GENE_HBB	Machine learning-based approaches for identifying human blood cells harboring CRISPR-mediated fetal chromatin domain ablations.Two common hemoglobinopathies, sickle cell disease (SCD) and beta-thalassemia, arise from genetic mutations within the beta-globin gene. In this work, we identified a 500-bp motif (Fetal Chromatin Domain, FCD) upstream of human Upsilon-globin locus and showed that the removal of this motif using CRISPR technology reactivates the expression of Upsilon-globin. Next, we present two different cell morphology-based machine learning approaches that can be used identify human blood cells (KU-812) that harbor CRISPR-mediated FCD genetic modifications. Three candidate models from the first approach, which uses multilayer perceptron algorithm (MLP 20-26, MLP26-18, and MLP 30-26) and flow cytometry-derived cellular data, yielded 0.83 precision, 0.80 recall, 0.82 accuracy, and 0.90 area under the ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve when predicting the edited cells. In comparison, the candidate model from the second approach, which uses deep learning (T2D5) and DIC microscopy-derived imaging data, performed with less accuracy (0.80) and ROC AUC (0.87). We envision that equivalent machine learning-based models can complement currently available genotyping protocols for specific genetic modifications which result in morphological changes in human cells.
35365364		Frequency of Opioid Prescription Filling After Discharge from the Pediatric Emergency Department.BACKGROUND: Little is known about prescription filling of pain medicine for children. In adult populations, race and insurance type are associated with differences in opioid prescription fill rate. We hypothesize that known disparities in pain management for children are exacerbated by the differential rates of opioid prescription filling between patients based on age and race. OBJECTIVE: To determine if there are demographic or clinical factors associated with differences in opioid prescription fill rates after discharge from the pediatric emergency department (ED). METHODS: This was a retrospective cross-sectional study of all patients younger than 19 years discharged with an opioid prescription from either of two pediatric EDs in 2018. We performed multivariable logistic regression to measure associations between prescription filling and demographic and clinical factors. RESULTS: There were 287 patient visits in which opioids were prescribed. Forty percent of prescriptions were filled. The majority of patients were male (53%), black (69%), and had public insurance (55%). There were no significant associations between prescription filling and age, insurance status, or race/ethnicity. Patients with sickle cell disease were more likely to fill prescriptions (odds ratio 3.87, 95% confidence interval 2.33-6.43) and patients without an identified primary care provider were less likely to fill prescriptions (odds ratio 0.16, 95% confidence interval 0.03-0.84). CONCLUSION: Less than half of opioid prescriptions prescribed at discharge from a pediatric emergency department are filled. Patient age, insurance status, and race/ethnicity are not associated with opioid prescription filling. Patients with sickle cell disease and those with a primary care provider are more likely to fill their opioid prescriptions.
35171440		The distinct longitudinal impact of pain catastrophizing on pain interference among youth living with sickle cell disease and chronic pain.Youth living with chronic sickle cell disease (SCD) pain are at risk for psychosocial distress and high levels of pain catastrophizing that contribute to functional impairment. This study aimed to identify the unique long-term impact of pain catastrophizing on pain impairment among youth with SCD. Youth with chronic SCD pain (N = 63, 10-18 years old, 58.3% female, 95.1% Black or African American) were recruited within comprehensive SCD clinics and completed a battery of measures at baseline and 4-months follow-up. A linear hierarchical regression examined baseline demographic and clinical characteristics (child SCD genotype, age, and average pain intensity), psychosocial functioning (anxiety, depression), and pain catastrophizing as predictors of pain interference at 4-months follow-up. Pain catastrophizing was the only unique predictor of pain interference at 4-months follow-up. Among youth with chronic SCD pain, pain catastrophizing warrants greater consideration as an important predictor that influences pain management and overall functioning.

37216689		New ASH initiatives to improve patient care of the long-overlooked Sickle Cell Disease.Due to the unique biology of sickle cell disease, as well as the societal disadvantages and racial inequities suffered by these patients, individuals with sickle cell disease have not benefited from the same remarkable advances in care and therapeutics as other hematologic disorders. Life expectancy of individuals with sickle cell disease is shortened by approximately 20 years even with optimal clinical care, and infant mortality continues to be a major concern in low-income countries. As hematologists, we must do more. ASH and the ASH Research Collaborative have instituted a multi-pronged initiative to improve the lives of individuals living with this disease. Here we describe two components of this ASH initiative, the Consortium on Newborn Screening in Africa (CONSA) to improve early diagnosis of infants in low-resource countries, and the Sickle Cell Disease Clinical Trial Network to accelerate the development of more effective therapeutics and care for those with this disorder. The combination of sickle cell disease-focused initiatives, the ASH Research Collaborative, CONSA, and the Sickle Cell Clinical Trials Network, have enormous potential to dramatically alter the course of sickle cell disease worldwide. We believe that the timing is ripe to embark on these critical and worthwhile initiatives and improve the lives of individuals with this disease.
33882639	stimulate|@DISEASE_Cerebral_Infarction|@GENE_SELP	Brain injury pathophysiology study by a multimodal approach in children with sickle cell anemia with no intra or extra cranial arteriopathy.Despite its high prevalence in children with sickle cell anemia (SCA), the pathophysiology of silent cerebral infarcts (SCI) remains elusive. The main objective of this study was to explore the respective roles of major determinants of brain perfusion in SCA children with no past or current history of intracranial or extracranial vasculopathy. We used a multimodal approach based notably on perfusion imaging arterial spin labeling (ASL) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and near infra-red spectroscopy (NIRS), as well as biomarkers reflecting blood rheology and endothelial activation. Out of 59 SCA patients (mean age 11.4+-3.9 yrs), eight (13%) had a total of 12 SCI. Children with SCI had a distinctive profile characterized by decreased blood pressure, impaired blood rheology, increased P-selectin levels, and marked anemia. Although ASL perfusion and oximetry values did not differ between groups, comparison of biological and clinical parameters according to the level of perfusion categorized in terciles showed an independent association between high perfusion and increased sP-selectin, decreased red blood cell deformability, low hemoglobin F level, increased blood viscosity and no a-thalassemia deletion. NIRS measurements did not yield additional novel results. Altogether, these findings argue for early MRI detection of SCI in children with no identified vasculopathy and suggest a potential role for ASL as an additional screening tool. Early treatment targeting hemolysis, anemia and endothelial dysfunction should reduce the risk of this under diagnosed and serious complication.

Hyperfiltration that delayed detection of CKD is common in SCA patients. Identification of novel urinary biomarkers correlating with glomerular filtration rates may help to detect and predict progression of renal disease. METHODS: Reanalysis of mass spectra of urinary samples obtained from University of Illinois at Chicago identified kringle domain-containing protein HGFL. RESULTS: HGFL levels correlated with hyperfiltration, were significantly reduced at CKD stage 1 compared to stage 0, negatively correlated with progression of CKD and were suitable for differentiation of stage 1. Better prediction of CKD progression to stage 2 was observed for HGFL-based risk prediction compared to the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)-based prediction. Results from a Howard University patient cohort supported the utility of HGFL-based test for the differentiation of stage 1 of CKD. CONCLUSION: Urinary HGFL may contribute additional information beyond eGFR and improve diagnosis of early-stage CKD in SCA patients.
34418379	associate|@CHEMICAL_N_N_dimethyl_4_anisidine|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell	Contraceptive use and preferences among females with sickle cell disease.OBJECTIVES: Females with sickle cell disease now have a life expectancy that extends well into and beyond their reproductive years. Pregnancy and childbirth are accompanied by high morbidity and mortality in this population, rendering contraception a critical part of their health care. STUDY DESIGN: We approached adult female patients of the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania hematology clinic who were of reproductive age (ages 18-45) and carried a diagnosis of sickle cell disease. We evaluated contraceptive method uptake and method characteristic preferences, as well as other reproductive history, and compared contraceptive uptake rates to that from female respondent data from the National Survey of Family Growth (2017-2019). RESULTS: Of 95 eligible patients, we completed surveys with 48 participants (response rate of 51%). Over half (n = 27, 56%) of participants were not currently using any form of contraception-double the rate of the general United States population (25%). The most common contraceptives currently used were the depot medroxyprogesterone (DMPA) injection (n = 6, 13%) and the progestin intrauterine device (IUD) (n = 6, 13%). DMPA uptake was significantly higher, and permanent contraceptive and oral contraceptive pill uptake significantly lower, among these participants with sickle cell disease compared to the general United States population. Participants' preferred contraceptive characteristics included effectiveness (n = 39, 81%), control over when to use the contraceptive (n = 39, 81%), and lack of side effects (n = 38, 79%). CONCLUSIONS: Contraceptive uptake was significantly lower and method mix different among females with sickle cell disease compared to the general United States population. Further research is needed on contraceptive safety, non-contraceptive benefits, and contraceptive decision-making for females with sickle cell disease. IMPLICATIONS: This study sheds light on the contraceptive choices and preferences of females with sickle cell disease, who are at disproportionate risk for pregnancy complications. In order to maximize the reproductive health of females with sickle cell disease, we must consider how their disease interacts with contraception and better understand how they approach contraceptive decision-making.
34196678		Comorbidities are risk factors for hospitalization and serious COVID-19 illness in children and adults with sickle cell disease.Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) are at high risk of developing serious infections, therefore, understanding the impact that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection has on this population is important. We sought to identify factors associated with hospitalization and serious COVID-19 illness in children and adults with SCD.We established the international SECURE-SCD Registry to collect data on patients with SCD and COVID-19 illness. We used multivariable logistic models to estimate the independent effects of age, sex, genotype, hydroxyurea, and SCD-related and -nonrelated comorbidities on hospitalization, serious COVID-19 illness, and pain as a presenting symptom during COVID-19 illness. As of 23 March 2021, 750 COVID-19 illness cases in patients with SCD were reported to the registry. We identified history of pain (relative risk [RR], 2.15; P < .0001) and SCD heart/lung comorbidities (RR, 1.61; P = .0001) as risk factors for hospitalization in children. History of pain (RR, 1.78; P = .002) was also a risk factor for hospitalization in adults. Children with history of pain (RR, 3.09; P = .009), SCD heart/lung comorbidities (RR, 1.76; P = .03), and SCD renal comorbidities (RR, 3.67; P < .0001) and adults with history of pain (RR 1.94, P = .02) were at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness. History of pain and SCD renal comorbidities also increased risk of pain during COVID-19 in children; history of pain, SCD heart/lung comorbidities, and female sex increased risk of pain during COVID-19 in adults. Hydroxyurea showed no effect on hospitalization and COVID-19 severity, but it lowered the risk of presenting with pain in adults during COVID-19.

37350061		Vaccination in sickle cell disease: Immunocompromised or immunocompetent?Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an immunocompromised condition and patients with SCD may have a reduced immune response to certain vaccinations. The report by Nakahara et al. demonstrated that SCD patients exhibited elevated and more sustained IgG production following COVID-19 vaccination, when compared to healthy controls. This suggests that the immune response to vaccinations may vary among different types of vaccines in individuals with SCD. Commentary on: Nakahara et al.

Early diagnosis and timely management of ACS results in better outcomes. However, the effectiveness of most treatment modalities for ACS management has not been established. AREAS COVERED: To review the treatment modalities management protocols and highlight the effectiveness of each option a literature search was done. Randomized controlled trials that assessed the efficacy of different treatment modalities in ACS management in SCD patients were chosen and reviewed. EXPERT OPINION: 11 randomized controlled trials were found that evaluated the efficacy of incentive spirometry, positive expiratory pressure device, intravenous dexamethasone, oral vs. intravenous morphine, inhaled nitric oxide, unfractionated heparin, and blood transfusion in the prevention or treatment of ACS. Although there are guidelines for ACS treatment, the available evidence is very limited to delineating the effectiveness of various interventions in ACS management. More high-quality studies and trials with a larger patient population can benefit this area to support the recommendations with stronger evidence.
36134546		Risk of COVID-19 hospitalizations among school-aged children in Scotland: A national incident cohort study.Background: There is considerable policy, clinical and public interest about whether children should be vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 and, if so, which children should be prioritised (particularly if vaccine resources are limited). To inform such deliberations, we sought to identify children and young people at highest risk of hospitalization from COVID-19. Methods: We used the Early Pandemic Evaluation and Enhanced Surveillance of COVID-19 (EAVE II) platform to undertake a national incident cohort analysis to investigate the risk of hospitalization among 5-17 years old living in Scotland in risk groups defined by the living risk prediction algorithm (QCOVID). A Cox proportional hazard model was used to derive hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between risk groups and COVID-19 hospital admission. Adjustments were made for age, sex, socioeconomic status, co-morbidity, and prior hospitalization. Results: Between March 1, 2020 and November 22, 2021, there were 146 183 (19.4% of all 752 867 children in Scotland) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections among 5-17 years old. Of those with confirmed infection, 973 (0.7%) were admitted to hospital with COVID-19. The rate of COVID-19 hospitalization was higher in those within each QCOVID risk group compared to those without the condition. Similar results were found in age stratified analyses (5-11 and 12-17 years old). Risk groups associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 hospital admission, included (adjusted HR, 95% CIs): sickle cell disease 14.35 (8.48-24.28), chronic kidney disease 11.34 (4.61-27.87), blood cancer 6.32 (3.24-12.35), rare pulmonary diseases 5.04 (2.58-9.86), type 2 diabetes 3.04 (1.34-6.92), epilepsy 2.54 (1.69-3.81), type 1 diabetes 2.48 (1.47-4.16), Down syndrome 2.45 (0.96-6.25), cerebral palsy 2.37 (1.26-4.47), severe mental illness 1.43 (0.63-3.24), fracture 1.41 (1.02-1.95), congenital heart disease 1.35 (0.82-2.23), asthma 1.28 (1.06-1.55), and learning disability (excluding Down syndrome) 1.08 (0.82-1.42), when compared to those without these conditions. Although our Cox models were adjusted for a number of potential confounders, residual confounding remains a possibility. Conclusions: In this national study, we observed an increased risk of COVID-19 hospital admissions among school-aged children with specific underlying long-term health conditions compared with children without these conditions.
36943194		Structures of ferroportin in complex with its specific inhibitor vamifeport.A central regulatory mechanism of iron homeostasis in humans involves ferroportin (FPN), the sole cellular iron exporter, and the peptide hormone hepcidin, which inhibits Fe2+ transport and induces internalization and degradation of FPN. Dysregulation of the FPN/hepcidin axis leads to diverse pathological conditions, and consequently, pharmacological compounds that inhibit FPN-mediated iron transport are of high clinical interest. Here, we describe the cryo-electron microscopy structures of human FPN in complex with synthetic nanobodies and vamifeport (VIT-2763), the first clinical-stage oral FPN inhibitor. Vamifeport competes with hepcidin for FPN binding and is currently in clinical development for beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease. The structures display two distinct conformations of FPN, representing outward-facing and occluded states of the transporter. The vamifeport site is located in the center of the protein, where the overlap with hepcidin interactions underlies the competitive relationship between the two molecules. The introduction of point mutations in the binding pocket of vamifeport reduces its affinity to FPN, emphasizing the relevance of the structural data. Together, our study reveals conformational rearrangements of FPN that are of potential relevance for transport, and it provides initial insight into the pharmacological targeting of this unique iron efflux transporter.

The goal of these transplants is to correct the hematopoietic defect with as little toxicity as possible. This requires mitigation of transplant-specific toxicities such as graft versus host disease, given this is not needed in non-malignant disorders. This review details current clinical outcomes in the field with a focus on post-transplantation cyclophosphamide and anti-thymoglobulin as intensive graft versus host disease prophylaxis to achieve that goal.

In the present study, we investigated whether the GGHI-mB-3D vector can also exhibit an equally therapeutic effect, following the transduction of sickle cell disease (SCD) CD34+ cells at MOI 100, leading to HbF increase coupled with HbS decrease, and thus, to phenotype improvement in vitro. We show that GGHI-mB-3D LV can lead to high and potentially therapeutic HbF levels, reaching a mean 2-fold increase to a mean value of VCN/cell of 1.0 and a mean transduction efficiency of 55%. Furthermore, this increase was accompanied by a significant 1.6-fold HbS decrease, a beneficial therapeutic feature for SCD. In summary, our data demonstrate the efficacy of the optimized gamma-globin lentiviral vector to improve the SCD phenotype in vitro, and highlights its potential use in future clinical SCD trials.
34600645		Exploring the Use of Exchange Transfusion in the Surgical Management of Priapism in Sickle Cell Disease: A Population-Based Analysis.INTRODUCTION: Priapism is a urologic emergency that may require surgical intervention in cases refractory to supportive care. Exchange transfusion (ET) has been previously used to manage sickle cell disease (SCD), including in priapism; however, its utilization in the context of surgical intervention has not been well-established. AIM: To explore the utilization of ET, as well as other patient and hospital-level factors, associated with surgical intervention for SCD-induced priapism METHODS: Using the National Inpatient Sample (2010-2015), males diagnosed with SCD and priapism were stratified by need for surgical intervention. Survey-weighted regression models were used to analyze the association of ET to surgical intervention. Furthermore, negative binomial regression and generalized linear models with logarithmic transformation were used to compare ET vs surgery to length of hospital stay (LOS) and total hospital charges, respectively. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Predictors of surgical intervention among patients with SCD-related priapism RESULTS: A weighted total of 8,087 hospitalizations were identified, with 1,782 (22%) receiving surgical intervention for priapism, 484 undergoing ET (6.0%), and 149 (1.8%) receiving combined therapy of both ET and surgery. On multivariable regression, pre-existing Elixhauser comorbidities (e.g. >=2 Elixhauser: OR: 2.20; P < 0.001), other forms of insurance (OR: 2.12; P < 0.001), and ET (OR: 1.99; P = 0.009) had increased odds of undergoing surgical intervention. In contrast, Black race (OR: 0.45; P < 0.001) and other co-existing SCD complications (e.g. infectious complications OR: 0.52; P < 0.001) reduced such odds. Compared to supportive care alone, patients undergoing ET (adjusted IRR: 1.42; 95% CI: 1.10-1.83; P = 0.007) or combined therapy (adjusted IRR: 1.42; 95% CI: 111-1.82; P < 0.001) had a longer LOS vs. surgery alone (adjusted IRR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.74-0.97; P = 0.017). Patients receiving ET (adjusted Ratio: 2.39; 95% CI: 1.52-3.76; P < 0.001) or combined therapy (adjusted Ratio: 4.42; 95% CI: 1.67-11.71; P = 0.003) had higher ratio of mean hospital charges compared with surgery alone (adjusted Ratio: 1.09; 95% CI: 0.69-1.72; P = 0.710). CONCLUSIONS: Numerous factors were associated with the need for surgical intervention, including the use of ET. Those receiving ET, as well as those with combined therapy, had a longer LOS and increased total hospital charges. Ha AS, Wallace BK, Miles C, et al.

Sevuparin is a novel non-anticoagulant low molecular weight heparinoid, with anti-adhesive properties. In this study, we tested whether sevuparin could shorten vaso-occlusive crisis duration in hospitalised patients with sickle cell disease. METHODS: We did a multicentre, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, phase 2 study in 16 public access clinical hospitals in the Netherlands, Lebanon, Turkey, Bahrain, Oman, Saudi Arabia, and Jamaica. Patients aged 12-50 years with a diagnosis of sickle cell disease (types HbSS, HbSC, HbSbeta0-thalassaemia, or HbSbeta+-thalassaemia) on a stable dose of hydroxyurea, hospitalised with vaso-occlusive crisis for parenteral opioid analgesia with a projected stay of more than 48 h were included in the study. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) using a computer-generated randomisation scheme to receive sevuparin (18 mg/kg per day) or placebo (NaCl, 0 9% solution) intravenously for 2-7 days until vaso-occlusive crisis resolution. All individuals involved in the trial were masked to treatment allocation. The analysis was done in the intention-to-treat population. The primary endpoint was time to vaso-occlusive crisis resolution defined as freedom from parenteral opioid use (in preceding 6-10 h); and readiness for discharge as judged by the patient or physician. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02515838. FINDINGS: Between Oct 7, 2015, and Feb 10, 2019, 144 patients were randomly assigned and administered sevuparin (n=69) or placebo (n=75). The median age was 22 2 years (range 12 2-33 6), 104 (72%) 144 were adults (18 years or older), and 90 (63%) were male and 54 (37%) were female. The intention-to-treat analysis for the primary endpoint showed no significant difference in median time to vaso-occlusive crisis resolution between the sevuparin and placebo groups (100 4 h [95% CI 85 5-116 8]) vs 86 4 h [70 6-95 1]; hazard ratio 0 89 [0 6-1 3]; p=0 55). Serious adverse events occurred in 16 (22%) of 68 patients in the sevuparin group and in 21 (22%) of patients in the placebo group. The most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events were pyrexia (17 [25%] in the sevuparin group vs 17 [22%] in the placebo group), constipation (12 [18%] vs 17 [22%]), and decreased haemoglobin (18 [26%] vs 9 [12%]). There were no deaths in the sevuparin group and there was one (1%) death in the placebo group after a hyper-haemolytic episode due to alloimmunisation. INTERPRETATION: This result, as well as the results seen in other clinical studies of inhibitors of adhesion in sickle cell disease, suggest that selectin-mediated adhesion might be important in the initiation, but not maintenance of vaso-occlusion, indicating that strategies to treat vaso-occlusive crises differ from strategies to prevent this complication.

34285390		Screening for autosomal recessive and X-linked conditions during pregnancy and preconception: a practice resource of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG).Carrier screening began 50 years ago with screening for conditions that have a high prevalence in defined racial/ethnic groups (e.g., Tay-Sachs disease in the Ashkenazi Jewish population; sickle cell disease in Black individuals). Cystic fibrosis was the first medical condition for which panethnic screening was recommended, followed by spinal muscular atrophy. Next-generation sequencing allows low cost and high throughput identification of sequence variants across many genes simultaneously. Since the phrase "expanded carrier screening" is nonspecific, there is a need to define carrier screening processes in a way that will allow equitable opportunity for patients to learn their reproductive risks using next-generation sequencing technology. An improved understanding of this risk allows patients to make informed reproductive decisions. Reproductive decision making is the established metric for clinical utility of population-based carrier screening. Furthermore, standardization of the screening approach will facilitate testing consistency. This practice resource reviews the current status of carrier screening, provides answers to some of the emerging questions, and recommends a consistent and equitable approach for offering carrier screening to all individuals during pregnancy or preconception.

However, there is limited literature that exists describing the role of INF in adult patients with VOC due to SCD. Current literature demonstrates that the use of IV morphine for VOC patients leads to reduced pain. Therefore, comparing the use of INF with IV morphine will establish the degree of effectiveness of INF for VOC patients. OBJECTIVE: To determine if intranasal fentanyl is equally as effective as IV morphine for treating VOC-associated pain in adult SCD patients. DESIGN: This study was a retrospective non-inferiority cohort study. Electronic health records were utilized to identify eligible patients between January 1, 2021 to February 28, 2022. Patients who received INF as an initial opioid upon presentation to the ED where allocated to the intervention group. On the other hand, individuals who received IV morphine as an initial opioid upon presentation to the ED were allocated to the control group. SETTING: A multi-site healthcare system containing five hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Patients 18 years of age or older, admitted to the ED with VOC due to SCD, and received INF or IV morphine as an initial opioid upon presentation to the ED. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was to evaluate the percent change in pain reduction after the initial dose of opiate between groups. Secondary outcomes include time to first rescue medication, total morphine milligram equivalent (MME) of IV opiates, hypotension, bradycardia, respiratory distress requiring opiate reversal within 6 h post- study drug administration, readmission within 48 h, and ED disposition. RESULTS: A total of 230 patients were reviewed within the study period, 95 subjects met inclusion criteria, 31 subjects were included in the INF arm and 64 subjects in the IV morphine arm. The primary outcome showed an average percent pain reduction of 17.25% in the INF arm and 17.15% in the IV morphine arm. The point estimate difference was 0.1% (95% CI -9.3%-9.5%; non-inferiority (p < 0.0001). The median dose of IV opiates was 8 MME in the INF group, and 6 MME in the IV morphine group (p = 0.0268). The time from study drug to first rescue medication administration was 22.4 min and 27.3 min in the INF and IV morphine groups, respectively (p = 0.2231). There was no incidence of hypotension or respiratory distress requiring opiate reversal in either arm. Bradycardia occurred in 12.9% and 7.7% (p = 0.2042), readmission rates within 48 h due to VOC was 6.5% and 20.9% (p = 0.0553), and discharge from the ED to home was 16% and 66% (p = 0.0196) in INF and IV morphine arms, respectively. CONCLUSION: INF provided similar pain reduction compared to IV morphine in the treatment of adults with VOC presenting to the ED. IV morphine arm showed a statistically significant difference in discharge to home from the ED, however there was a trend in readmission within 48 h. The study showed no significant difference in hypotension, respiratory distress, or bradycardia between the groups. The INF group had no significant impact on time to drug administration compared to IV morphine, however it was within 1 h of patient presentation which complies with American Society of Hematology (ASH) guidelines. In conclusion, our study showed that INF was non-inferior when compared to IV morphine in reducing pain scores after drug administration. Therefore, INF is an effective alternative to IV morphine for pain management in adults presenting to the ED for VOC particularly in those with limited IV access.
37929626		Safety of Ultrasound Contrast Agents in Pediatric Patients With Sickle Cell Disease and Trait.Ultrasound contrast agent (UCA) use is increasing. Recent isolated reports observed a rise in pain-related adverse events with the intravenous administration of the UCA Definity in adults with sickle cell disease. To date, no studies have investigated the incidence of similar adverse events with UCA Lumason or Optison. We describe our experience regarding the safety of Lumason and Optison in children with sickle cell disease and trait who underwent contrast-enhanced ultrasound exams in our department with intravenous, intravesical, and other intracavitary routes. No pain-related or other adverse events were observed in this pediatric population with any route of UCA administration.
34489185		Complete neurological recovery from fat embolism syndrome in sickle cell disease after sequential red cell exchange transfusion and therapeutic plasma exchange.Fat embolism syndrome in sickle cell disease is associated with great mortality, while more than half of survivors suffer severe neurological sequelae. Release of fat droplets leads to obstruction of the microcirculation as well as generation of proinflammatory cytokines that can cause direct tissue injury. Red cell exchange transfusion can be life-saving but the addition of therapeutic plasma exchange may further improve outcomes by removing such inflammatory mediators. Here, we describe the case of a 27-year-old male patient with sickle cell anaemia presenting with typical features of fat embolism syndrome including neurological involvement with greatly reduced level of consciousness. MRI of his brain showed multiple widespread microhemorrhages giving the characteristic "star field" pattern but also a cytotoxic lesion of the corpus callosum, known to be the result of direct neurotoxicity by proinflammatory cytokines. The patient underwent emergency red cell exchange transfusion leading only to modest clinical improvement but fully regained consciousness after three cycles of therapeutic plasma exchange. This case highlights the deleterious effect of the hyperinflammatory state characteristic of many sickle cell complications and supports further exploring the potential benefit from plasma exchange as an adjunct to red cell exchange in order to remove proinflammatory cytokines during acute complications of sickle cell disease.
37694765		Mixed donor chimerism following stem cell transplantation for sickle cell disease.Sickle cell disease is a debilitating hemoglobinopathy with high morbidity and mortality. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) is curative, but the presence of mixed donor/recipient chimerism post-HCT raises concerns about disease control long-term. Mixed donor/recipient chimerism is reported in significant numbers even after aggressive HCT conditioning regimens. Post-HCT, adequacy of donor erythropoiesis is crucial for disease control. This review explores the relationship between mixed donor/recipient chimerism and outcomes post-HCT. Serial chimerism analysis in lineage specific manner in erythroid or myeloid cells post-HCT predicts for disease control and HCT success. Adequate and stable donor-derived erythropoiesis is essential for reversing SCD manifestations. Myeloid lineage chimerism mirrors erythropoiesis is commercially available, and a reliable indicator of adequacy. Using this tool, the minimum threshold of donor chimerism is required to prevent SCD-related complications and maintain sickle hemoglobin less than 50% is approximately 20-25% even when a donor has Hb S trait. Curative interventions should, at a minimum, meet this goal long-term. Achieving a balance between successful engraftment while minimizing toxicity is important in patients vulnerable because of age or preexisting morbidity and is the objective of recent clinical trials. As HCT and gene therapies evolve, efficient long-term follow-up that includes durability assessment of mixed donor/recipient chimerism will be crucial.

34332804		Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant for sickle cell disease: The why, who, and what.Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants (allo-HSCTs) from matched-related donors (MRDs), mismatched-related donors (MMRDs), and matched-unrelated donors (MUDs) are increasingly being used to treat sickle cell disease (SCD) in both pediatric and adult patients. The overall results have been extremely encouraging, especially if a MRD is available and the transplant being performed before the age of 13. Although there is a general consensus that patients with high-risk SCD, even in adults and irrespective of donor characteristics, should be offered allo-HSCT, the debates on optimal patient selection and timing of transplant have yet to be resolved. Unlike patients with hematologic malignancies, there are also a number of clinical issues that require to be addressed in patients with SCD undergoing allo-HSCT. In this review, we will discuss the reasons allo-HSCT should be offered more widely to patients with SCD, the challenges facing physicians in patient selection and timing of transplant, and the awareness of and solutions to prevent the complications that are unique or more common in SCD undergoing allo-HSCT.

METHODS: Thirty-one participants with sickle cell disease (SCD) and 31 healthy participants in the control-comparison group (CG), both aged 8-17 years underwent auditory system evaluation (pure tone audiometry and acoustic reflex), were screened for the risks of (central) auditory processing disorder and dysfunction of cognitive function using the Scale of Auditory Behaviors (SAB) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), respectively, and were interviewed to obtain clinical data and data on school performance. RESULTS: In the SCD group, eight (25.8%) participants presented with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). The group with SCD and SNHL presented a higher occurrence of poor school performance than the group of participants with SCD without SNHL (p = 0.016). The MMSE score for aspects related to attention and calculation in the SCD group with SNHL was lower than in the SCD group without SNHL (p = 0.016). In the SAB, the SCD group with SNHL presented a lower score than the SCD group without SNHL in aspects related to academic performance and attention. CONCLUSION: Hearing impairment in children and adolescents with SCD, specifically SNHL, is associated with poor school performance and enhances the risk of cognitive impairment in terms of attention and calculation.

36161320	treat|@CHEMICAL_Busulfan|@DISEASE_Systemic_carnitine_deficiency	Lovo-cel gene therapy for sickle cell disease: Treatment process evolution and outcomes in the initial groups of the HGB-206 study.lovo-cel (bb1111; LentiGlobin for sickle cell disease [SCD]) gene therapy (GT) comprises autologous transplantation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells transduced with the BB305 lentiviral vector encoding a modified beta-globin gene (betaA-T87Q ) to produce anti-sickling hemoglobin (HbAT87Q ). The efficacy and safety of lovo-cel for SCD are being evaluated in the ongoing phase 1/2 HGB-206 study (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02140554). The treatment process evolved over time, using learnings from outcomes in the initial patients to optimize lovo-cel's benefit-risk profile. Following modest expression of HbAT87Q in the initial patients (Group A, n = 7), alterations were made to the treatment process for patients subsequently enrolled in Group B (n = 2, patients B1 and B2), including improvements to cell collection and lovo-cel manufacturing. After 6 months, median Group A peripheral blood vector copy number (>=0.08 c/dg) and HbAT87Q levels (>=0.46 g/dL) were inadequate for substantial clinical effect but stable and sustained over 5.5 years; both markedly improved in Group B (patient B1: >=0.53 c/dg and >=2.69 g/dL; patient B2: >=2.14 c/dg and >=6.40 g/dL, respectively) and generated improved biologic and clinical efficacy in Group B, including higher total hemoglobin and decreased hemolysis. The safety of the lovo-cel for SCD treatment regimen largely reflected the known side effects of HSPC collection, busulfan conditioning regimen, and underlying SCD; acute myeloid leukemia was observed in two patients in Group A and deemed unlikely related to insertional oncogenesis. Changes made during development of the lovo-cel treatment process were associated with improved outcomes and provide lessons for future SCD GT studies.

38485402		[The transition of adolescents with sickle cell disease: an interdisciplinary exchange].With the rising incidence of sickle cell disease, this chronic pathology is becoming the most common genetic disease in France. Advances in care have led to a marked improvement in life expectancy. Caregivers in pediatric facilities are therefore increasingly confronted with the question of the transition to adulthood of the adolescents they have been following since birth. As nurses working in Robert-Debre's transfusion and curative medicine unit, in 2022, adolescents accounted for 57 % of sickle cell patients enrolled in our transfusion exchange program. Adolescence is a period of major change, and the repercussions of the disease are all the more pronounced. This raises the issue of transferring them to the adult sector.
35894560		High-Priced Sickle Cell Gene Therapies Threaten to Exacerbate US Health Disparities and Establish New Pricing Precedents for Molecular Medicine.Gene therapies to treat sickle cell disease are in development and are expected to have high costs. The large eligible population size - by far, the largest for a gene therapy - poses daunting budget challenges and threatens to exacerbate health disparities for Black patients, who make up the vast majority of American sickle cell patients.
34917079		Early Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cells (eMDSCs) Are Associated With High Donor Myeloid Chimerism Following Haploidentical HSCT for Sickle Cell Disease.Haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (haplo-HSCT) is a widely available curative option for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Our original non-myeloablative haplo-HSCT trial employing post-transplant (PT) cyclophosphamide had a low incidence of GVHD but had high rejection rates. Here, we aimed to evaluate immune reconstitution following haplo-HSCT and identify cytokines and cells associated with graft rejection/engraftment. 50 cytokines and 10 immune cell subsets were screened using multiplex-ELISA and flow cytometry, respectively, at baseline and PT-Days 30, 60, 100, and 180. We observed the most significant differences in cytokine levels between the engrafted and rejected groups at PT-Day 60, corresponding with clinical findings of secondary graft rejection. Of the 44 cytokines evaluated, plasma concentrations of 19 cytokines were different between the two groups at PT-Day 60. Factor analysis suggested two independent factors. The first factor (IL-17A, IL-10, IL-7, G-CSF, IL-2, MIP-1a, VEGF, and TGFb1 contributed significantly) was strongly associated with engraftment with OR = 2.7 (95%CI of 1.4 to 5.4), whereas the second factor (GROa and IL-18 contributed significantly) was not significantly associated with engraftment. Sufficient donor myeloid chimerism (DMC) is critical for the success of HSCT; here, we evaluated immune cells among high (H) DMC (DMC>=20%) and low (L) DMC (DMC<20%) groups along with engrafted and rejected groups. We found that early myeloid-derived suppressor cell (eMDSC) frequencies were elevated in engrafted patients and patients with HDMC at PT-Day 30 (P< 0.04 & P< 0.003, respectively). 9 of 20 patients were evaluated for the source of eMDSCs. The HDMC group had high mixed chimeric eMDSCs as compared to the LDMC group (P< 0.00001). We found a positive correlation between the frequencies of eMDSCs and Tregs at PT-Day 100 (r=0.72, P <0.0007); eMDSCs at BSL and Tregs at PT-Day 100 (r=0.63, P <0.004). Of 10 immune regulatory cells and 50 cytokines, we observed mixed chimeric eMDSCs and IL-17A, IL-10, IL-7, G-CSF, IL-2, MIP-1a, VEGF, TGFb1 as potential hits which could serve as prognostic markers in predicting allograft outcome towards engraftment following haploidentical HSCT employing post-transplant cyclophosphamide. The current findings need to be replicated and further explored in a larger cohort.
34057455		Quantification of Cellular Densities and Antigenic Properties using Magnetic Levitation.The described method was developed based on the principles of magnetic levitation, which separates cells and particles based on their density and magnetic properties. Density is a cell type identifying property, directly related to its metabolic rate, differentiation, and activation status. Magnetic levitation allows a one-step approach to successfully separate, image and characterize circulating blood cells, and to detect anemia, sickle cell disease, and circulating tumor cells based on density and magnetic properties. This approach is also amenable to detecting soluble antigens present in a solution by using sets of low- and high-density beads coated with capture and detection antibodies, respectively. If the antigen is present in solution, it will bridge the two sets of beads, generating a new bead-bead complex, which will levitate in between the rows of antibody-coated beads. Increased concentration of the target antigen in solution will generate a larger number of bead-bead complexes when compared to lower concentrations of antigen, thus allowing for quantitative measurements of the target antigen. Magnetic levitation is advantageous to other methods due to its decreased sample preparation time and lack of dependance on classical readout methods. The image generated is easily captured and analyzed using a standard microscope or mobile device, such as a smartphone or a tablet.
35404888		Outpatient Pain Management in Children With Chronic Pancreatitis: A Scoping Systematic Review.OBJECTIVES: Although pain management is central to pediatric chronic pancreatitis (CP) care, no evidence-based guidelines exist. In this scoping systematic review, we sought promising strategies for CP pain treatment in children. METHODS: We systematically reviewed literature on pain management in children and adults with CP, and 2 conditions with similar pain courses: juvenile idiopathic arthritis and sickle cell disease. RESULTS: Of 8997 studies identified, 287 met inclusion criteria. There are no published studies of analgesic medications, antioxidants, dietary modification, integrative medicine, or regional nerve blocks in children with CP. In adults with CP, studies of nonopioid analgesics, pancreatic enzymes, and dietary interventions have mixed results. Retrospective studies suggest that endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and surgical procedures, most durably total pancreatectomy with islet autotransplant, improve pain for children with CP. Follow-up was short relative to a child's life. Large studies in adults also suggest benefit from endoscopic therapy and surgery, but lack conclusive evidence about optimal procedure or timing. Studies on other painful pediatric chronic illnesses revealed little generalizable to children with CP. CONCLUSIONS: No therapy had sufficient high-quality studies to warrant untempered, evidence-based support for use in children with CP. Multicenter studies are needed to identify pain management "best practices."
35705370	treat|@CHEMICAL_Penicillins|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell ;treat|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell	Sickle cell disease in children: an update of the evidence in low- and middle-income settings.Sickle cell disease (SCD), one of the most common monogenetic diseases in the world, is associated with multisystemic complications that begin in childhood. Most of the babies homozygous for the sickle haemoglobin gene are born in sub-Saharan Africa. Over the years, progress has been made with early diagnosis through newborn screening, penicillin prophylaxis, pneumococcal immunisation, transcranial Doppler (TCD) screening, hydroxyurea therapy and chronic blood transfusions with remarkably improved survival and quality of life of children with SCD. However, wide disparities in outcomes exist between high-income countries (HICs) where over 90% survive to adulthood, and low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) where less than half achieve that milestone. Even in HICs, racial inequities pose barriers to accessing specialised care and receiving treatment for acute pain episodes. Better understanding of SCD pathophysiology is being exploited to develop new disease-modifying drugs and gene therapy approaches to further improve outcomes. Bone marrow transplantation is established as a curative treatment for SCD, but it is largely unavailable in LMICs. To bridge the disparity and inequity gaps, innovative approaches are needed in LMICs. Validated and more affordable, easy-to-use point-of-care tests offer opportunities to link early diagnosis with immunisation programmes and healthcare encounters. Widespread use of hydroxyurea therapy-a relatively affordable and effective disease-modifying drug-in LMICs would help improve survival and quality of life. Integration of SCD treatment into primary care linked to district level/provincial hospitals that are supported with evidence-based guidelines will help extend needed interventions to many more patients living in LMICs.
33715942		Primary Immunization Series Coverage of Children With Sickle Cell Disease.INTRODUCTION: Children with sickle cell disease are at increased risk of serious infections, many of which can be prevented by receipt of recommended immunizations. Study objectives were to (1) assess the primary immunization series coverage among children with sickle cell disease and (2) compare the coverage with that of those without sickle cell disease. METHODS: The Michigan Care Improvement Registry was used to obtain primary immunization series doses and sickle cell disease status for all eligible children in Michigan born in 2001-2016 (analysis was conducted in 2019). Completion of series and each individual vaccine were assessed for every child at ages 19 and 35 months. Proportions were stratified by sickle cell disease status and compared using chi-square tests. Logistic regression was used to model the odds of completing the series at each age, as predicted by sickle cell disease status and adjusting for the presence of Medicaid identification number. RESULTS: The proportion of children who completed the immunization series was higher for those with sickle cell disease than for those without sickle cell disease at 19 months (58.5% vs 48.0%) and 35 months (74.7% vs 59.6%) (both p<0.0001). The odds of completing the series were 1.4 times higher at 19 months (95% CI=1.2, 1.6) and 1.7 times higher at 35 months (95% CI=1.5, 2.0) for children with sickle cell disease than for those without, adjusting for the presence of Medicaid identification number. CONCLUSIONS: Although children with sickle cell disease had higher immunization rates than those without sickle cell disease, >40% of children with sickle cell disease did not receive all recommended immunizations by age 19 months. Immunization information systems should be utilized to improve routine immunization coverage of children with sickle cell disease.
34121200		Antigen matching for transfusion support in Brazilian female patients with sickle cell disease to reduce RBC alloimmunization.BACKGROUND: Red blood cell (RBC) alloimmunization is a complication of patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and it has a greater impact on pregnancy, leading to a risk of hemolytic disease of the newborn and reducing blood availability for pregnant women. This study proposed to evaluate antigen matching transfusion protocols, aiming to reduce RBC alloimmunization in Brazilian female patients with SCD. METHODS: Samples from female patients with SCD (153) and self-declared Afro-Brazilian donors (307) were genotyped for RBC antigens and RH variants were investigated. The transfusion needs of patients during 1-year period and the number of compatible donors were assessed using three antigen-matching transfusion protocols: prophylactic CEK antigen-matched RBCs, prophylactic extended antigen-matched RBCs, and extended-matched red blood cells (RBCs) only for alloimmunized patients. In addition, RH molecular matching has been proposed for patients carrying variant RHCE. RESULTS: Provision of CEK antigen-matched donors would have been possible in 92.4% of transfusion events while provision of prophylactic extended antigen-matched RBCs would cover 88.7% of the transfusion events. Extended antigen matching for alloimmunized patients would be efficient in 99% of the cases. The presence of partial D in 10 patients increased the need of D-negative donors. Compatible donors could be enough for four of the five patients with altered RHCE genotypes in both alleles. CONCLUSION: In Brazilians, screening African descent donors allows the implementation of prophylactic CEK and extended antigen-matching transfusion protocols to female patients with SCD to reduce RBC alloimmunization; however, the supply of compatible blood can be impaired for patients with Rh variants.
34850464		Sickle cell disease patients in two London trusts: Genotyping including RH variants.BACKGROUND: All SCD patients need extended RBC antigen typing (by serology or genotyping) for provision of extended RH, K matched blood and to guide RBC selection in those with complex transfusion requirements. Genotyping can also identify RH variants which can cause sensitisation even when extended RH phenotypically matched blood is provided and alloantibodies associated with RH variants can cause HTRs. OBJECTIVES: To review the use of RBC genotyping in SCD patients at two London trusts (ICHNT, LNWH) with a focus on RH variants. METHODS: Retrospective review with data collected from clinical notes, local and national pathology reporting systems. RESULTS: A 311/482 (64%) ICHNT patients and 181/346 (52%) LNWH patients had extended genotyping. Of genotyped patients, 68 (22%) ICHNT and 31 (17%) LNWH patients had RH variants. Eight ICHNT patients had RH variants and corresponding antibodies associated with RH variants; 4/8 received multiple transfusions with antigen positive RBCs but had no evidence of haemolysis. One LNWH patient had a RH variant with corresponding alloantibody but could not be investigated further for possible HTR. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients (59%) had genotyping and a significant number had RH variants (99, 20%). A small proportion (9, 9%) had antibodies associated with RH variants, but with no evidence of clinically significant HTRs despite transfusions in four of them with antigen positive RBCs. All SCD patients should have RBC genotyping including RH variants (preferentially over extended phenotyping) to guide better selection of RBC units. However, where antigen negative blood cannot be provided, the risk of alloimmunisation is not inevitable and subsequent HTRs from antibodies associated with RH variants might not always occur.
36594168		Pregnancy outcomes in women with sickle cell disease in California.Adverse pregnancy outcomes occur frequently in women with sickle cell disease (SCD) across the globe. In the United States, Black women experience disproportionately worse maternal health outcomes than all other racial groups. To better understand how social determinants of health impact SCD maternal morbidity, we used California's Department of Health Care Access and Information data (1991-2019) to estimate the cumulative incidence of pregnancy outcomes in Black women with and without SCD-adjusted for age, insurance status, and Distressed Community Index (DCI) scores. Black pregnant women with SCD were more likely to deliver at a younger age, use government insurance, and live in at-risk or distressed neighborhoods, compared to those without SCD. They also experienced higher stillbirths (26.8, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 17.5-36.1 vs. 12.4 [CI: 12.1-12.7], per 1000 births) and inpatient maternal mortality (344.5 [CI: 337.6-682.2] vs. 6.1 [CI: 2.3-8.4], per 100 000 live births). Multivariate logistic regression models showed Black pregnant women with SCD had significantly higher odds ratios (OR) for sepsis (OR 14.89, CI: 10.81, 20.52), venous thromboembolism (OR 13.60, CI: 9.16, 20.20), and postpartum hemorrhage (OR 2.25, CI 1.79-2.82), with peak onset in the second trimester, third trimester, and six weeks postpartum, respectively. Despite adjusting for sociodemographic factors, Black women with SCD still experienced significantly worse pregnancy outcomes than those without SCD. We need additional studies to determine if early introduction to reproductive health education, continuation of SCD-modifying therapies during pregnancy, and increasing access to multidisciplinary perinatal care can reduce morbidity in pregnant women with SCD.
38161155		Management of Acute Sickle Cell Disease Pain.Pain is a common complication of sickle cell disease. Sickle cell pain can often be effectively managed by pediatricians in outpatient and hospital settings. Acute pain management should be initiated quickly. Patients need to be evaluated for sickle cell complications and other causes of pain. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids are the mainstay of pain treatment, but additional therapies include hydration, local pain control, muscle relaxants, and nonpharmacologic approaches. Healthy lifestyle habits and good behavioral and mental health are important for preventing and coping with sickle cell disease pain. Disease-modifying therapies, such as hydroxyurea, can help prevent sickle hemoglobin polymerization and acute pain episodes. Because sickle cell disease largely affects people who are racialized minorities in the United States, health-care providers need to be aware of how their own personal biases may affect care of these patients.
35975375		Depression among patient with sickle cell disease: Prevalence and prediction.Background: Depression is a widespread disorder with either an independent or interrelated relationship with chronic disease. Aim: This study aims to assess depression prevalence and its predictors among patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Patients and Methods: This is a cross-sectional study conducted in Saudi Arabia where patients with SCD assessed for having depression through Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9). Results: Depression was evaluated among 88 patients with SCD with a median age of 32.6 +- 11.8. Out of 88 patients, 44 (50%) participants had some form of depression. Out of those with depression, 25 (56.8%) had mild depression and 18 (40.9%) had moderate depression. However, there was a significant relationship between depression and the number of annual emergency visits, intensive care unit admissions, and frequency of blood transfusion (P-value < 0.05). There was no significant relationship between depression with neither hemoglobin nor HbS (P-value > 0.05). However, depression score found to be inversely proportional to the HbF level. Both gender and annual emergency visits were significantly related to depression (P-value = 0.01, 0.001. respectively). Conclusion: Depression is quite prevalent in patients with SCD though it is still being overlooked. Several clinical and laboratory indices found to be closely linked to depression. Constellations of these factors may help early recognition of depression and disease severity modulation.
35131182		Therapeutic plasma exchange in the management of acute complications of sickle cell disease: A single centre experience.Sickle cell disease results in systemic inflammation even at steady state and this is accentuated during acute crises. The plasma of affected patients contains several proinflammatory cytokines as well as adhesion molecules and prothrombotic factors. This environment promotes further red cell sickling while many of these substances can cause direct tissue toxicity and end-organ damage. Even though red cell transfusion, whether simple or exchange, is the mainstay of treatment of severe acute complications, addition of therapeutic plasma exchange could potentially provide additional benefit by removing such harmful substances. Here, we describe two cases where therapeutic plasma exchange was used. The first involved a patient with the acute chest syndrome who despite adequate red cell exchange remained significantly hypoxic and in severe pain. We therefore proceeded to perform plasma exchange; this led to rapid clinical improvement and resolution of his symptoms. The second case involved a patient with intractable chest wall pain and impending acute chest syndrome; this patient also had a past history of hyperhaemolysis. The patient underwent therapeutic plasma exchange with very rapid resolution of the pain, avoidance of any respiratory deterioration and full recovery. We also give a brief summary of our previous experience using plasma exchange in patients with sickle cell disease. Plasma exchange was well tolerated with no adverse events in all cases we have treated, led to rapid resolution of pain irrespective of primary indication and in the majority of cases to a favourable clinical outcome.

Previous work revealed that knockout of Clcn6 on the Dahl Salt-Sensitive (SS) rat background (SS-Clcn6) resulted in lower diastolic blood pressure compared to SS-WT rats. Additionally, a recent study found sickle cell anemia patients with mutations in CLCN6 had improved survival and reduced stroke risk. We investigated whether loss of Clcn6 would delay the mortality of Dahl SS rats on an 8% NaCl (HS) diet. No significant difference in survival was found. The ability of Clcn6 to affect mRNA expression of nearby Mthfr, Nppa, and Nppb genes was also tested. On normal salt (0.4% NaCl, NS) diets, renal Mthfr mRNA and protein expression were significantly increased in the SS-Clcn6 rats. MTHFR reduces homocysteine to methionine, but no differences in circulating homocysteine levels were detected. Nppa mRNA levels in cardiac tissue from SS-Clcn6 rat in both normotensive and hypertensive conditions were significantly reduced compared to SS-WT. Nppb mRNA expression in SS-Clcn6 rats on a NS diet was also substantially decreased. Heightened Mthfr expression would be predicted to be protective; however, diminished Nppa and Nppb expression could be deleterious and by preventing or blunting vasodilation, natriuresis, and diuresis that ought to normally occur to offset blood pressure increases. The conserved nature of this genetic locus in humans and rats suggests more studies are warranted to understand how mutations in and around these genes may be influencing the expression of their neighbors.

36201515		Sickle cell disease and pregnancy profile of complicated malaria in 982 pregnancies in Kinshasa.INTRODUCTION: Malaria is associated with high morbidity during pregnancy. Homozygous sickle cell pregnant women are even more exposed during complicated malaria. The objective of the study was to evaluate the maternal and fetal morbidity of homozygous sickle cell pregnant pregnant women with complicated malaria. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective case-control study of 982 pregnancies in sickle cell pregnant women, during which a group of sickle cell pregnant women who received antimalarial chemoprophylaxis was compared to another group without chemoprophylaxis. We analyzed the clinical evolution of pregnant women (VOCs and transfusions, pregnancy weight gain) and parasite (parasite density at the time of diagnosis of complicated malaria and during treatment for three days). We analyzed the parameters of newborns at birth (age of pregnancy at the time of delivery, birth weight, weight of the placenta and histopathological examination of the placenta. RESULTS: Out of 982 pregnancies, 15% of pregnant women suffered from complicated malaria, 57% suffered from uncomplicated malaria and 28% did not suffer from malaria. Pregnancy weight gain, birth weight, was better in the group of pregnant women who received chemoprophylaxis and the placenta had less histological lesions. Parasite density was low. There was a significant positive correlation between parasite density and the number of CVOs and transfusions and between parasite density and histological lesions of the placenta and low birth weight. CONCLUSION: Complicated malaria is associated with high maternal and fetal morbidity in sickle cell patients. Malaria chemoprophylaxis can reduce maternal and fetal complications and parasite density during malaria infection.

37702734		Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in pediatric patients with sickle cell anemia.INTRODUCTION: Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is a hemoglobinopathy presenting severe endothelial damage associated with increased prevalence of hypertension (HTN). Few studies have used ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) in pediatric patients with SCA. The aim of this study was to characterize the ABPM profile in children with SCA. METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted on all subjects <18 years of age with SCA who presented at a medical reference center in the city of Cartagena, Colombia. Anthropometric, clinical laboratory, treatment, and ABPM parameters, including ambulatory arterial stiffness index (AASI) were registered. RESULTS: The study included 79 patients, of these, 23 (29%) children had normal BP, 49 (62%) had abnormal BP and 7 (9%) had HTN. Mean age was 10.5 +- 3.6 years and 44 (56%) cases were male. Forty-eight (60%) patients had pre-HTN. Masked HTN was present in 6 (8%) patients. One (1%) had ambulatory HTN, and another one (1%) had white coat HTN. The HTA group exhibited significantly higher systolic BP and diastolic BP compared to the other groups in 24-hour BP readings, daytime BP, and night-time BP ABPM parameters (P < 0.05), except for daytime DBP (P = 0.08). Mean AASI was 0.4 +- 0.2. The HTN group had the highest AASI value compared to the other groups (P = 0.006). CONCLUSION: Significant alterations in ABPM parameters are frequently observed in pediatric patients with SCA. The incorporation of ABPM, along with the assessment of AASI, is recommended for a comprehensive evaluation of cardiovascular and renal risk in SCA patients.
35998894		Eclampsia a preventable tragedy: an African overview.Eclampsia is a multisystemic disease associated with various complications which individually or in combination can lead to maternal/fetal morbidity and mortality. Developed countries and some developing countries were largely successful in reducing the incidence of eclampsia. Developing countries especially those in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are still dealing with high incidence of eclampsia. The question is why have the incidence and mortality of eclampsia remained high in SSA? The risk factors for this disease are globally the same but a critical assessment showed that there are certain risk factors that are common in Sub-Saharan Africa (multiple pregnancy, sickle cell disease, pregnancies at the extremes of reproductive age, pre-existing vasculitis). In addition, there are compounding factors (illiteracy, poverty, superstitious beliefs, poor prenatal care services, poorly trained manpower and lack of facilities to cater for patients). Addressing the menace of this disease require a holistic approach which among others, includes education to address beliefs and reduce harmful practices, poverty alleviation which will improve the ability for communities to afford health care services. Improving transport services to convey patients quickly to facilities on time when there is need. Improving the health infrastructure, building more facilities, providing trained and motivated manpower and regular supply of quality essential drugs for the management of the disease. This review is meant to analyze factors prevalent in Sub-Saharan that hinder reducing incidence of the disease and provide comprehensive and cost-effective solutions.
38205646		Management of a patient with sickle cell disease and multiple red blood cell alloantibodies in preparation for a hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.BACKGROUND: Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is currently the only widely available curative option for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Alloimmunization in this population is frequent and can complicate transfusion management during the HSCT period. The case of a pediatric patient with severe SCD clinical phenotype, multiple alloantibodies (9), and hyperhemolysis syndrome who underwent haploidentical HSCT is described. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The patient was known for an anti-e, despite RHCE*01.01 allele, which predicts a C- c+ E- weak e+ phenotype. Donors matching the patient's extended phenotype were targeted for RHCE genotyping. RESULTS: Donors homozygotes or heterozygotes for RHCE*01.01 were selected for compatibility analyses and ranked based on strength of reactions. Discordance between zygosity and strength of reactions was observed, as the most compatible donors were heterozygotes for RHCE*01.01. In total, the patient received seven RBC units from two different donors during HSCT process without transfusion reaction or development of new alloantibodies. Six months post-HSCT, his hemoglobin level is stable at around 120 g/L and his chimerism is 100%. DISCUSSION: This case highlights the complexity of transfusion management during HSCT of alloimmunized patients with SCD. Collecting sufficient compatible units requires early involvement of transfusion medicine teams and close communication with the local blood provider. Genotyping of donors self-identifying as Black is useful for identifying compatible blood for those patients but has some limitations. HSCT for heavily alloimmunized patients is feasible and safe with early involvement of transfusion medicine specialists. Further research on the clinical impact of genotypic matching is needed.

The main purpose of this study was to assess the effect of artemisinin derivatives on in vivo parasite clearance according to erythrocyte variants. In vivo response was investigated through retrospective data obtained over a 42-day artemether-lumefantrine/artesunate amodiaquine efficacy protocol conducted from 2012 to 2016. RESULTS: A total of 770 patients in Cote d'Ivoire attending the hospitals of Anonkoua-koute (Abidjan), Petit Paris (Korhogo), Libreville (Man), Dar es salam (Bouake), Ayame and Yamoussoukro with acute uncomplicated falciparum malaria were selected for successful hemoglobin typing. HbAS, HbSS, HbAC, and HbSC genotypes were found. Parasite clearance time was obtained for 414 patients. In the population with abnormal hemoglobin, parasite densities on admission and parasite clearance rates were significantly lower in the HbSC group compared to HbAA (p = 0.02 and p = 0.007, respectively). After PCR correction on day 42, the acute treatment rate was 100% for each group. Parasite half-life and time for initial parasitaemia to decline by 50 and 99% were longer for the HbSC group (p < 0.05). The study also investigated the prevalence of K13-propeller polymorphisms across different hemoglobin genotype groups. A total of 185 and 63 samples were sequenced in the HbAA group and patients with abnormal Hb, respectively. Only two nonsynonymous mutations D559N and V510M were found in the HbAA group. CONCLUSION: Although this study proved good efficacy of artemether-lumefantrine and artesunate amodiaquine in the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in patients with abnormal hemoglobin, the increased delay of parasite clearance may represent a threat to health in these patients in relation with sickle cell crisis, which could support selection of parasites resistant to artemisinin.
37317564		Plasma exchange-A useful adjunct therapy to red cell exchange in patients with sickle cell disease and multiorgan dysfunction.BACKGROUND: Urgent red cell exchange (RBCx) is indicated for many complications of sickle cell disease (SCD), including acute chest syndrome, stroke, and hepatic/splenic sequestration. Many who receive RBCx remain hospitalized and develop further complications, including multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), a leading cause of death in intensive care units. Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) has been advocated as an effective treatment of MODS, but its role in SCD compared with RBCx alone is not well studied. METHODS: We identified all ICU encounters from 2013 to 2019 involving RBCx procedures for MODS or SCD crisis that progressed to MODS, a total of 12 encounters. Data regarding hospital length of stay (LOS), survival, number of TPE procedures following RBCx, and procedure characteristics were collected. Surrogate laboratory markers of end-organ damage and disease severity scores were recorded at the time of admission, post-RBCx, post-TPE, and at discharge. RESULTS: Eight encounters involved RBCx followed by TPE (TPE group) while four involved RBCx alone (RBCx group). The TPE group had a higher SOFA score at ICU admission (9.5 vs. 7.0), greater predicted mortality, and a statistical trend toward higher disease severity scores following RBCx relative to the RBCx group (p = 0.10). The TPE group showed a significantly greater decrease in SOFA score between RBCx and discharge (p = 0.04). No significant difference in mortality or hospital LOS was observed between the groups. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest TPE may be considered as an adjunct treatment for patients with acute complications of SCD that progress to MODS, especially in cases where there is no significant improvement following RBCx.
38263886		Reversal of Cerebral Arteriopathy Post-Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant for Sickle Cell Disease.Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a chronic hematologic disorder which causes progressive cerebral arteriopathy beginning in childhood. As a result, arterial ischemic stroke is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in SCD, and SCD is a leading cause of childhood stroke worldwide. Allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) may be curative for individuals with SCD. Long-term outcomes and effects are currently being studied. In this report, we describe a child with SCD who presented with arterial ischemic stroke at 6 years of age and was found to have a severe form of cerebral large vessel arteriopathy by catheter-directed angiography. The patient initially underwent revascularization surgery by indirect superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery bypass, and 1 year later, he underwent curative HSCT. Approximately 3 years after HSCT, repeat catheter-directed angiography revealed a striking reversal of cerebral large vessel arteriopathy. This article reveals a previously unrecognized and potentially beneficial effect of HSCT that may ameliorate cerebral large vessel arteriopathy and improve cerebrovascular health for children with SCD.
34367429		Knowledge, attitude and control practices of sickle cell diseases among senior secondary students in Osun State, Nigeria.INTRODUCTION: sickle cell disease is one of the greatest public health problems of this age. This study was conducted to assess the knowledge, attitude and control practices on sickle cell disease (SCD) among selected secondary school students in Osun State, Nigeria. METHODS: a descriptive cross-sectional study involved 420 secondary school students within Osogbo Metropolis selected by a multistage stratified sampling technique, using self-administered structured questionnaire. Data were collected using pre-tested self-administered semi structured questionnaire. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 20. RESULTS: a total of 420 students were interviewed, modal age range 15-20 years. There were more females (55%) than males (45%). Majority of them were christians (57.1%). A larger percentage of the respondents were aware of SCD (58.5%). However, comprehensive knowledge as regards the various genotypes related to SCD, tests to be done for genotype screening among the respondents is low. One third of the respondents had positive attitude towards SCD (65%) and nearly one half (48%) of the respondents had bad control practices. CONCLUSION: findings in this study shows a high level of general awareness on SCD, even though comprehensive knowledge as regards the various genotype related to SCD, tests to be done for genotype screening among others is low. The need to improve on their attitude and practice towards the disease is highly recommended because having a good knowledge is not as important as applying the knowledge in a way to stop the spread of the disease.
34254882		A Comparison of Two Regimens for Managing Sickle Cell Pain and Reducing Readmissions.This was a multicenter retrospective analysis comparing intravenous push (IVP) analgesia versus patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) in patients admitted for sickle cell pain crisis. The primary objective was to compare the analgesic management, measured in total daily morphine milligram equivalents (MME). Secondary objectives included length of hospitalization, 30-day hospital readmissions and pain scores. Of the 98 patients identified between August 2017 and August 2018, 68 patients were included in this study. There were 51% (n = 35) in the IVP group and 49% (n = 33) in the PCA group. The majority of patients were on 90 or more daily MME prior to admission. The average total daily MME was significantly higher in patients on PCA compared to IVP on the first three days of hospitalization (289 vs 146, p < 0.01). Length of hospitalization was not different between patients on IVP and PCA (7.14 vs. 6.39 days, p = 0.53). There was no difference in 30-day readmissions, average pain scores on days 1-3 of hospitalization and adverse side effects between the groups. This study showed patients on IVP had significantly lower total daily MME requirements compared to PCA within the first three calendar days of admission.
35452362		The spectrum and burden of in-patient paediatric musculoskeletal diseases in Northern Tanzania.BACKGROUND: Musculoskeletal diseases (MSD) are a major contributor to the global burden of disease and disability, and disproportionally affect low- and middle-income countries; however, there is a dearth of epidemiological data. Affected children often face increased morbidity, social isolation and economic hardship. AIM: To assess the spectrum and burden of paediatric MSD in children aged 5-18 years admitted to a major referral hospital in Tanzania. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of children aged 5-18 years admitted to Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre (KCMC) whose initial diagnosis was recognised as a musculoskeletal condition by the International Classification of Diseases-10 between 1 January and 31 December 2017. RESULTS: During 2017, 163 cases of confirmed paediatric MSD were admitted to KCMC, representing 21.2% of all admissions of children aged 5-18 years (n = 769). Bone disease was the most common diagnosis. They comprised 106 (65.0%) traumatic fractures, 31 (19.0%) osteo-articular infections, 9 (5.5%) malunions and 3 (1.8%) pathological fractures. Congenital defects and rheumatic disease were relatively uncommon, accounting for only 6 (3.7%) and 4 (2.5%) MSD admissions, respectively. CONCLUSION: The majority of cases of MSD were related to fractures, followed by osteo-articular infections, while recognised cases of rheumatic disease were rare. The study, although small, identified the sizeable burden and spectrum of paediatric MSD admitted to a hospital in Tanzania over a 12-month period and highlights the need for larger studies to inform the optimal allocation of health resources.

37298325	cause|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Hypogonadism ;treat|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Hematologic_Neoplasms ;negative_correlate|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@CHEMICAL_Testosterone ;treat|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell	Resumption of Spermatogenesis and Fertility Post Withdrawal of Hydroxyurea Treatment.Hydroxyurea (HU), a drug for treating cancers of the blood and the management of sickle cell anemia, induces hypogonadism in males. However, the impact of HU on testicular architecture and function, as well as its effects on the resumption of male fertility following treatment withdrawal, remain poorly understood. We used adult male mice to determine whether HU-induced hypogonadism is reversible. Fertility indices of mice treated with HU daily for ~1 sperm cycle (2 months) were compared with those of their control counterparts. All indices of fertility were significantly reduced among mice treated with HU compared to controls. Interestingly, significant improvements in fertility indices were apparent after a 4-month withdrawal from HU treatment (testis weight: month 1 post-HU withdrawal (M1): HU, 0.09 +- 0.01 vs. control, 0.33 +- 0.03; M4: HU, 0.26 +- 0.03 vs. control, 0.37 +- 0.04 g); sperm motility (M1: HU,12 vs. 59; M4: HU, 45 vs. control, 61%; sperm density (M1: HU, 1.3 +- 0.3 vs. control, 15.7 +- 0.9; M4: HU, 8.1 +- 2.5 vs. control, 16.8 +- 1.9 million). Further, circulating testosterone increased in the 4th month following HU withdrawal and was comparable to that of controls. When a mating experiment was conducted, recovering males sired viable offspring with untreated females albeit at a lower rate than control males (p < 0.05); therefore, qualifying HU as a potential candidate for male contraception.
37387218		Toward Automated Detection of Silent Cerebral Infarcts in Children and Young Adults With Sickle Cell Anemia.BACKGROUND: Silent cerebral infarcts (SCI) in sickle cell anemia (SCA) are associated with future strokes and cognitive impairment, warranting early diagnosis and treatment. Detection of SCI, however, is limited by their small size, especially when neuroradiologists are unavailable. We hypothesized that deep learning may permit automated SCI detection in children and young adults with SCA as a tool to identify the presence and extent of SCI in clinical and research settings. METHODS: We utilized UNet-a deep learning model-for fully automated SCI segmentation. We trained and optimized UNet using brain magnetic resonance imaging from the SIT trial (Silent Infarct Transfusion). Neuroradiologists provided the ground truth for SCI diagnosis, while a vascular neurologist manually delineated SCI on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and provided the ground truth for SCI segmentation. UNet was optimized for the highest spatial overlap between automatic and manual delineation (dice similarity coefficient). The optimized UNet was externally validated using an independent single-center prospective cohort of SCA participants. Model performance was evaluated through sensitivity and accuracy (%correct cases) for SCI diagnosis, dice similarity coefficient, intraclass correlation coefficient (metric of volumetric agreement), and Spearman correlation. RESULTS: The SIT trial (n=926; 31% with SCI; median age, 6.8 years) and external validation (n=80; 50% with SCI; age, 11.5 years) cohorts had small median lesion volumes of 0.40 and 0.25 mL, respectively. Compared with the neuroradiology diagnosis, UNet predicted SCI presence with 100% sensitivity and 74% accuracy. In magnetic resonance imaging with SCI, UNet reached a moderate spatial agreement (dice similarity coefficient, 0.48) and high volumetric agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.76; rho=0.72; P<0.001) between automatic and manual segmentations. CONCLUSIONS: UNet, trained using a large pediatric SCA magnetic resonance imaging data set, sensitively detected small SCI in children and young adults with SCA. While additional training is needed, UNet may be integrated into the clinical workflow as a screening tool, aiding in SCI diagnosis.
38409146		The Evaluation of Invasive Prenatal Diagnostic Tests in North Cyprus: A Retrospective Study.BACKGROUND: Congenital diseases are still an important medical, social, and economic problem all over the world. In North Cyprus, in addition to other reasons, early prenatal diagnostic measures are undertaken to prevent births with thalassemia major, a locally widespread genetic disease. AIM: This study aims to evaluate the results of prenatal invasive diagnostic tests performed in a private obstetrics clinic in Northern Cyprus and show the diagnosis process of thalassemia and chromosomal anomalies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study is a retrospective, descriptive study. Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) results and the amniocentesis tests performed between 1990 and 2022 are evaluated. Thalassemia and chromosome analysis of samples obtained by CVS and amniocentesis tests were performed. To diagnose alpha or beta thalassemia and sickle cell, 239 CVS was performed. And to diagnose chromosomal anomalies, 396 CVS and amniocentesis were performed. RESULTS: The mean age of the 480 pregnant women included in the study was 31.12 years (18-46) and 30% of them were older than 34 years. The most common indications for invasive prenatal diagnostic test (IPDT) were; mother/father thalassemia minor/major, advanced maternal age, high risk of ultrasonography erase findings, and the noninvasive screening test. The result of IPDT detected 7.3% chromosomal anomaly and 69.5% thalassemia and sickle cell anemia. Of the 239 CVS performed to diagnose alpha or beta thalasemia and sickle cell, 23.4% beta major, 42.3% beta minor, and 2.1% alpha minor were diagnosed. Of the 396 CVS and amniocentesis performed to diagnose chromosomal anormalies; 2.8% of Down syndrome and 4.54% of other chromosomal anomalies were diagnosed. CONCLUSION: IPDT is important in correctly diagnosing fetal anomalies at the prenatal stage to help families decide at the right time.
34373610		Deep learning-enabled ultra-widefield retinal vessel segmentation with an automated quality-optimized angiographic phase selection tool.OBJECTIVES: To demonstrate the feasibility of a deep learning-based vascular segmentation tool for UWFA and evaluate its ability to automatically identify quality-optimized phase-specific images. METHODS: Cumulative retinal vessel areas (RVA) were extracted from all available UWFA frames. Cubic splines were fitted for serial vascular assessment throughout the angiographic phases of eyes with diabetic retinopathy (DR), sickle cell retinopathy (SCR), or normal retinal vasculature. The image with maximum RVA was selected as the optimum early phase. A late phase frame was selected at a minimum of 4 min that most closely mirrored the RVA from the selected early image. Trained image analysts evaluated the selected pairs. RESULTS: A total of 13,980 UWFA sequences from 462 sessions were used to evaluate the performance and 1578 UWFA sequences from 66 sessions were used to create cubic splines. Maximum RVA was detected at a mean of 41 +- 15, 47 +- 27, 38 +- 8 s for DR, SCR, and normals respectively. In 85.2% of the sessions, appropriate images for both phases were successfully identified. The individual success rate was 90.7% for early and 94.6% for late frames. CONCLUSIONS: Retinal vascular characteristics are highly phased and field-of-view sensitive. Vascular parameters extracted by deep learning algorithms can be used for quality assessment of angiographic images and quality optimized phase selection. Clinical applications of a deep learning-based vascular segmentation and phase selection system might significantly improve the speed, consistency, and objectivity of UWFA evaluation.
35801747		Cerebral hemodynamics in children with sickle cell disease in India: An observational cohort study.India has the second highest number of cases of sickle cell disease (SCD) and affects the most socioeconomically disadvantaged communities living in a horizontal belt from Gujarat to Odisha state. Despite high prevalence, information about cerebral hemodynamics among children with SCD in India remains scarcely described. We performed transcranial Doppler (TCD) to assess cerebral hemodynamics among Indian children with SCD and evaluated their association with clinical and hematological parameters. Children aged 3-18years, diagnosed with SCD living in Raipur in Chhattisgarh and Ahmedabad in Gujarat state were recruited. TCD was performed to obtain flow velocities from middle cerebral (MCA), intracranial internal carotid (ICA) and basilar artery. Associations were evaluated between timed-average-mean-maximum velocities (TAMMV) and various clinical and hematological parameters. Our prospective study included 62 consecutive children with known SCD. Mean +- SD age of the study population was 9.8 +- 3.9 years and 31 (50%) were male. Mean +- SD hemoglobin was 8.64 +- 1.34 Gm/dL while the mean HbSS +- SD was 70.25 +- 15.27%. While 6 (9.6%) children had suffered from stroke during previous 2 years, 7 (11%) demonstrated abnormal TAMMV. Higher HbSS level along with history of iron chelation therapy, blood transfusion and/or stroke showed a trend towards having higher TAMMV. Stroke and cerebral hemodynamic alterations are common among Indian children with SCD. Larger studies with detailed neuroimaging and genetic evaluations are needed for better understanding, characterization, risk stratification as well as optimization of the timing of blood transfusion to reduce physical disabilities among Indian children with SCD.
36356169		Assessment of transition readiness to predict health care utilization during transition to adult care in sickle cell disease.BACKGROUND: Transition-age patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) are at risk for poor outcomes associated with incomplete transition readiness and neurocognitive deficits. Study objectives were to: 1) test if a SCD-specific measure of self-management skills was associated with transition outcomes and 2) evaluate if caregiver-reported executive functioning was associated with self-management skills and transition outcomes among youth with SCD. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Youth/caregivers were selected from a longitudinal cohort study. Caregivers completed the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF); caregivers and youth completed the Self-Management Skills Checklist (SMSC) at a median age of 16.8 +- 0.6 years. Non-parametric tests compared SMSC and transition outcomes. Regression assessed the incremental validity of SMSC in predicting transition outcomes. RESULTS: In total, 95 participants (54% male, 55% severe genotype) completed the SMSC assessment. Most participants (87%) transferred to adult care within six months and 87% were retained for at least 12 months. BRIEF and caregiver-reported SMSC assessments were weakly, negatively correlated (rho = -0.25, p = 0.0392) but were not significant in predicting transition outcomes (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The SMSC and executive function did not predict adult care engagement. Development of readiness assessments that predict care engagement and reflect self-efficacy is important for monitoring transition-aged patients with SCD.
37953236		"The project did not come to us with a solution": Perspectives of research teams on implementing a study about electronic health record-embedded individualized pain plans for emergency department treatment of vaso-occlusive episodes in adults with sickle cell disease.BACKGROUND: This study aimed to capture the implementation process of the ALIGN Study, (An individualized Pain Plan with Patient and Provider Access for Emergency Department care of Sickle Cell Disease). ALIGN aimed to embed Individualized Pain Plans in the electronic health record (E-IPP) and provide access to the plan for both adult patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and emergency department providers when a person with SCD comes to the emergency department in vaso-occlusive crises. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with research teams from the 8 participating sites from the ALIGN study. Seventeen participants (principal investigators and study coordinators) shared their perspectives about the implementation of ALIGN in their sites. Data were analyzed in three phases using open coding steps adapted from grounded theory and qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: A total of seven overarching themes were identified: (1) the E-IPP structure (location and upkeep) and collaboration with the informatics team, (2) the role of ED champion, (3) the role of research coordinators, (4) research team communication, and communication between research team and clinical team, (5) challenges with the study protocol, (6) provider feedback: addressing over-utilizers, patient mistrust, and the positive feedback about the intervention, and (7) COVID-19 and its effects on study implementation. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study contribute to learning how to implement E-IPPs for adult patients with SCD in ED. The study findings highlight the importance of early engagement with different team members, a champion from the emergency department, study coordinators with different skills and enhancement of communication and trust among team members. Further recommendations are outlined for hospitals aiming to implement E-IPP for patients with SCD in ED.
36170507		Sickle Cell Disease and Gene Therapy - Patient and Physician Perspectives.
38050205		Nosocomial infections in sickle cell anemia patients: Prevention through multi-disciplinary approach: A review.Sickle cell anemia (SCA), a hereditary blood disorder characterized by the presence of abnormal hemoglobin, poses a unique set of challenges for both patients and healthcare providers. One of the most pressing issues in the care of these individuals is the persistent threat of nosocomial infections, which are infections acquired during hospitalization. This abstract provides a concise overview of the ongoing challenge of nosocomial infections in SCA patients, highlighting the factors contributing to their vulnerability and the preventive measures in place. SCA patients face increased susceptibility to nosocomial infections due to their compromised immune systems, frequent hospitalizations, prolonged stays, and the need for invasive medical interventions. The emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens further complicates the management of these infections. To address this challenge, healthcare facilities have implemented infection control protocols, vaccination strategies, and antimicrobial stewardship, emphasizing the importance of patient education. Recognizing the gravity of this issue and adopting comprehensive preventive measures is crucial to improving the quality of care and patient outcomes in this vulnerable population. Further research and ongoing efforts are essential to reducing the burden of nosocomial infections in SCA patients and enhancing their overall healthcare experience.
34803155		Navigating Ethical Challenges for Pediatric Sickle Cell Pain Management in the Context of the Opioid Epidemic.OBJECTIVES: The aim was to describe the impact of the opioid epidemic on pain management practices in pediatric sickle cell disease (SCD) and propose a conceptual framework for navigating ethical decision-making in pediatric sickle cell pain management. METHODS: A review of the literature on ethical challenges in the management of sickle cell pain was conducted and considered in the context of the opioid epidemic and psychosocial factors affecting youth with SCD. The Integrated Ethical Framework for Pain Management (IEFPM) was applied to pediatric sickle cell pain management using a clinical case example. RESULTS: Implicit bias, health-related stigma, and potential neurocognitive impairment all present unique challenges in ethical decision-making for youth with SCD. National guidelines for prescribing opioid medication may complicate providers' clinical decision-making and affect their sickle cell pain management practices. The IEFPM was found to be applicable to ethical decision-making for pediatric sickle cell pain and captures both patient-related and provider-related aspects of clinical pain management. DISCUSSION: The opioid epidemic has exacerbated existing ethical challenges for pain management among youth with SCD. The IEFPM provides a conceptual model that can be integrated into health care settings to facilitate ethical decision-making and promote greater health equity in the clinical management of pediatric sickle cell pain.
37933708		Impact of a hospital service for adults with chronic childhood-onset disease: A propensity weighted analysis.BACKGROUND: Young adults with chronic childhood-onset diseases (CCOD) transitioning care from pediatrics to adult care are at high risk for readmission after hospital discharge. At our institution, we have implemented an inpatient service, the Med-Peds (MP) line, to improve transitions to adult care and reduce hospital utilization by young adults with CCOD. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the effect of the MP line on length of stay (LOS) and 30-day readmission rates compared to other inpatient services. METHODS: This was an observational, retrospective cohort analysis of patients admitted to the MP line compared to other hospital service lines over a 2-year period. To avoid potential confounding by indication for admission to the MP line, propensity score weighting methods were used. RESULTS: The MP line cared for 302 patients with CCOD from June 2019 to July 2021. Compared to other service lines, there was a 33% reduction in relative risk of 30-day readmission (26.9% compared to 40.3%, risk ratio = 0.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.55-0.81). LOS was 10% longer for the MP line (event time ratio (ETR): 1.10 95% CI 1.0-1.21) with median LOS 4.8 versus 4.5 days. Patients with sickle cell disease had less of a reduction in 30-day readmissions and longer LOS. CONCLUSION: Hospitalization for young adults with CCOD on a MP service line was associated with lower 30-day readmission rates and longer LOS than hospitalization on other services. Further research is needed to assess which components of the line most contribute to decreased utilization.
34483044		Challenging the dogma of the healthy heterozygote: Implications for newborn screening policies and practices.Heterozygous (carrier) status for an autosomal recessive condition is traditionally considered to lack significance for an individual's health, but this assumption has been challenged by a growing body of evidence. Carriers of several autosomal recessive disorders and some X-linked diseases are potentially at risk for the pathology manifest in homozygotes. This minireview provides an overview of the literature regarding health risks to carriers of two common autosomal recessive conditions on the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel: sickle cell disease [sickle cell trait (SCT)] and cystic fibrosis (CF). We also consider and comment on bioethical and policy implications for newborn blood screening (NBS). Health risks for heterozygotes, while relatively low for individuals, are often influenced by intrinsic (e.g., other genomic variants or co-morbidities) and extrinsic (environmental) factors, which present opportunities for personalized genomic medicine and risk counseling. They create a special challenge, however, for developing screening/follow-up policies and for genetic counseling, particularly after identification and reporting of heterozygote status through NBS. Although more research is needed, this minireview of the SCT and CF literature to date leads us to propose that blanket terms such as "healthy heterozygotes" or "unaffected carriers" should be superseded in communications about NBS results, in favor of a more nuanced paradigm of setting expectations for health outcomes with "genotype-to-risk." In the molecular era of NBS, it remains clear that public health needs to become better prepared for the full range of applied genetics.
35137943		Hybrid bone SPECT/CT reveals spleen calcification in sickle cell mutation and beta-thalassemia.We present a case of a 65 years-old male with sickle cell mutation and beta-thalassemia (Hb S/beta-Thal), who had whole-body bone scan evaluation for osteomyelitis. The examination revealed high radiopharmaceutical uptake in the left abdomen. Further evaluation with hybrid single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) showed calcification of approximately the entire spleen, in the context of sickle cell anemia. This report highlights the role of SPECT/CT in such cases.
34210267		Health services use by children identified as heterozygous hemoglobinopathy mutation carriers via newborn screening.BACKGROUND: Newborn screening (NBS) for sickle cell disease incidentally identifies heterozygous carriers of hemoglobinopathy mutations. In Ontario, Canada, these carrier results are not routinely disclosed, presenting an opportunity to investigate the potential health implications of carrier status. We aimed to compare rates of health services use among children identified as carriers of hemoglobinopathy mutations and those who received negative NBS results. METHODS: Eligible children underwent NBS in Ontario from October 2006 to March 2010 and were identified as carriers or as screen-negative controls, matched to carriers 5:1 based on neighbourhood and timing of birth. We used health care administrative data to determine frequencies of inpatient hospitalizations, emergency department (ED) visits, and physician encounters through March 2012, using multivariable negative binomial regression to compare rates of service use in the two cohorts. We analyzed data from 4987 carriers and 24,935 controls. RESULTS: Adjusted incidence rate ratios (95% CI) for service use in carriers versus controls among children < 1 year of age were: 1.11 (1.06-1.17) for ED visits; 0.97 (0.89-1.06) for inpatient hospitalization; and 1.02 (1.00-1.04) for physician encounters. Among children >=1 year of age, adjusted rate ratios were: 1.03 (0.98-1.07) for ED visits; 1.14 (1.03-1.25) for inpatient hospitalization and 0.92 (0.90-0.94) for physician encounters. CONCLUSIONS: While we identified statistically significant differences in health services use among carriers of hemoglobinopathy mutations relative to controls, effect sizes were small and directions of association inconsistent across age groups and health service types. Our findings are consistent with the assumption that carrier status is likely benign in early childhood.
34051718		Transcranial Doppler Ultrasonography Imaging Studies in Children with Sickle Cell Anaemia in a Tertiary Hospital, Abuja, Nigeria.BACKGROUND: Stroke risk in sickle cell anaemia (SCA) can be detected by abnormalities of cerebral blood flow velocities (CBFV), measurable by Transcranial Doppler Imaging (TCDI) ultrasonography. This has become an important strategy in the routine care of children with SCA globally. OBJECTIVES: To determine the pattern of CBFV and document the proportion of children with SCA at risk of stroke at National Hospital Abuja (NHA), Nigeria using TCDI. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of 130 children aged 2-16 years with SCA attending the haematology clinic at NHA. Systematic random sampling method was used in recruiting the participants and CBFV over the middle cerebral artery (MCA) were measured by TCDI technique. The criteria from the stroke prevention (STOP) trial in SCA used to stratify stroke risk, as modified for TCDI was employed to evaluate CBFV from the study. Thus, CBFV (stroke risk) were normal (standard) < 155cm/sec, conditional 155-179cm/sec and abnormal (high) >180cm/sec. RESULTS: There were 130 children with SCA, aged 7.7 +- 4.1 (mean age +- SD) years; and 59.2% were males. This study documented CBFV (stroke risk) as: normal 106 (81.5%), conditional 15 (11.5%) and abnormal (high) 9 (6.9%) in the MCA. The highest CBFV was recorded in the right MCA and ICA with 272cm/sec and 262cm/sec, respectively. There were significant interhemispheric differences between the CBFV on the right and left of PCA and ICA. CONCLUSION: This study documented that a significant proportion of children with SCA in Nigeria were at risk of stroke. Hence, the need for routine monitoring for stroke risk in children with SCA.

Previously, we found an abnormality in prostacyclin-thromboxane ratio in sickle cell pregnant women, a situation that is also found in non-sickle pregnancies with PE and unexplained IUGR. Low-dose aspirin (LDA) has been shown to reduce the incidence of PE and IUGR in high-risk women by reducing the vasoconstrictor thromboxane while sparing prostacyclin, in effect 'correcting' the ratio. It has been found to be safe for use in pregnancy but has not been tested in sickle cell pregnancy. We hypothesise that LDA will reduce the incidence of IUGR and PE in pregnant haemoglobin SS (HbSS) and haemoglobin SC (HbSC) women. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a multisite, double blind, randomised controlled trial, comparing a daily dose of 100 mg aspirin to placebo, from 12 to 16 weeks' gestation until 36 weeks, in Lagos state, Nigeria. Four hundred and seventy-six eligible pregnant HbSS and HbSC women will be recruited consecutively, randomly assigned to either group and followed from recruitment until delivery. The primary outcome will be the incidence of birth weight below 10th centile for gestational age on INTERGROWTH 21 birth weight charts, or incidence of miscarriage or perinatal death. Secondary outcomes will include PE, maternal death, preterm delivery, perinatal death, number of crises, need for blood transfusion and complications such as infections and placental abruption. Analysis will be by intention to treat and the main treatment effects will be quantified by relative risk with 95% CI, at a 5% significance level. ETHICAL APPROVAL: Ethical approval has been granted by the Health Research and Ethics committees of the recruiting hospitals and the National Health Research and Ethics Committee. Study findings will be presented at conferences and published appropriately. TRAIL REGISTRATION NUMBER: PACTR202001787519553; Pre-results.
35373382	treat|@CHEMICAL_Iron|@DISEASE_beta_Thalassemia	Beta-thalassemia and the advent of new interventions beyond transfusion and iron chelation.Beta-thalassaemia, including sickle cell anaemia and thalassaemia E, is most common in developing countries in tropical and subtropic regions. Because carriers have migrated there owing to demographic migration, beta-thalassaemia can now be detected in areas other than malaria-endemic areas. Every year, an estimated 300 000-500 000 infants, the vast majority of whom are from developing countries, are born with a severe haemoglobin anomaly. Currently, some basic techniques, which include iron chelation therapy, hydroxyurea, blood transfusion, splenectomy and haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, are being used to manage thalassaemia patients. Despite being the backbone of treatment, traditional techniques have several drawbacks and limitations. Ineffective erythropoiesis, correction of globin chain imbalance and adjustment of iron metabolism are some of the innovative treatment methods that have been developed in the care of thalassaemia patients in recent years. Moreover, regulating the expression of B-cell lymphoma/leukaemia 11A and sex-determining region Y-box through the enhanced expression of micro RNAs can also be considered putative targets for managing haemoglobinopathies. This review focuses on the biological basis of beta-globin gene production, the pathophysiology of beta-thalassaemia and the treatment options that have recently been introduced.
34148067		Increased non-typhoidal Salmonella hospitalizations in transfusion-naive thalassemia children: a nationwide population-based cohort study.INTRODUCTION: Although non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) infection usually causes self-limited enterocolitis, several risk factors have been found to predispose individuals to more severe NTS infections. However, few studies have discussed the association between NTS infection and pediatric thalassemia populations. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A nationwide population-based retrospective cohort study was conducted using medical records of the selected children from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. Immunocompromised individuals or patients with a history of transfusion or splenectomy were excluded. One thalassemia patient was matched with four non-thalassemia patients based on their year of birth, sex, and urbanization level. RESULTS: In this cohort, 912 patients with thalassemia and 3648 comparison cohort were analyzed. The mean age of NTS hospitalization was 2.0 +- 1.4 in thalassemia cohort and 2.6 +- 2.4 in non-thalassemia cohort. Transfusion-naive thalassemia children were proved to have a higher rate of NTS hospitalization (6.90 vs 4.11 per 1000 person-year; p = 0.0004) than the non-thalassemia cohort, with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.68 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.26-2.24). CONCLUSION: Our research shows that transfusion-naive thalassemia is associated with an increased risk of NTS hospitalization. Further prospective study comparing the incidence and severity of NTS infection among children with and without thalassemia is needed. IMPACT: Pediatric transfusion-naive thalassemia patients have an 1.68-fold increased risk for hospitalization due to non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) infection. This is the first nationwide population-based cohort study based on an extremely large database that shows pediatric transfusion-naive thalassemia patients have an increased risk for NTS hospitalizations. Besides the previously known risk factors such as extremes of age, sickle cell disease, or immunosuppressing conditions, clinicians must also take thalassemia as a possible risk factor for more severe NTS disease.
36476798		[Application of genome editing technology in gene therapy].Genome editing has been attracting increasing attention as a new treatment for several refractory diseases since the CRISPR-Cas discovery has facilitated easy modification of target chromosomal DNA. The concept of treating refractory diseases by genome editing has been achieved in various animal models, and genome editing has been applied to human clinical trials for beta-thalassemia, sickle cell disease, mucopolysaccharidosis, transthyretin amyloidosis, HIV infection, and CAR-T therapy. The genome editing technology targets the germline in industrial applications in animals and plants and is directed at the chromosomal DNA of the somatic cells in human therapeutic applications. Genome editing therapy for germline cells is currently forbidden due to ethical and safety concerns. Concerns regarding genome editing technology include safety (off-target effects) as well as technical aspects (low homologous recombination). Various technological innovations for genome editing are expected to expand its clinical application to various diseases in the future.

33648529	treat|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_beta_Thalassemia ;treat|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell ;positive_correlate|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@GENE_HBG1	A comprehensive review of hydroxyurea for beta-haemoglobinopathies: the role revisited during COVID-19 pandemic.BACKGROUND: Hydroxyurea is one of the earliest drugs that showed promise in the management of haemoglobinopathies that include beta-thalassaemia and sickle cell disease. Despite this, many aspects of hydroxyurea are either unknown or understudied; specifically, its usefulness in beta-thalassaemia major and haemoglobin E beta-thalassaemia is unclear. However, during COVID-19 pandemic, it has become a valuable adjunct to transfusion therapy in patients with beta-haemoglobinopathies. In this review, we aim to explore the available in vitro and in vivo mechanistic data and the clinical utility of hydroxyurea in beta-haemoglobinopathies with a special emphasis on its usefulness during the COVID-19 pandemic. MAIN BODY: Hydroxyurea is an S-phase-specific drug that reversibly inhibits ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase enzyme which catalyses an essential step in the DNA biosynthesis. In human erythroid cells, it induces the expression of gamma-globin, a fetal globin gene that is suppressed after birth. Through several molecular pathways described in this review, hydroxyurea exerts many favourable effects on the haemoglobin content, red blood cell indices, ineffective erythropoiesis, and blood rheology in patients with beta-haemoglobinopathies. Currently, it is recommended for sickle cell disease and non-transfusion dependent beta-thalassaemia. A number of clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate its usefulness in transfusion dependent beta-thalassaemia. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it was widely used as an adjunct to transfusion therapy due to limitations in the availability of blood and logistical disturbances. Thus, it has become clear that hydroxyurea could play a remarkable role in reducing transfusion requirements of patients with haemoglobinopathies, especially when donor blood is a limited resource. CONCLUSION: Hydroxyurea is a well-tolerated oral drug which has been in use for many decades. Through its actions of reversible inhibition of ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase enzyme and fetal haemoglobin induction, it exerts many favourable effects on patients with beta-haemoglobinopathies. It is currently approved for the treatment of sickle cell disease and non-transfusion dependent beta-thalassaemia. Also, there are various observations to suggest that hydroxyurea is an important adjunct in the treatment of transfusion dependent beta-thalassaemia which should be confirmed by randomised clinical trials.
34608107		EVALUATION OF MACULAR FLOW VOIDS ON OPTICAL COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY ANGIOGRAPHY AS POTENTIAL BIOMARKERS FOR SILENT CEREBRAL INFARCTION IN SICKLE CELL DISEASE.PURPOSE: To determine the relationship between macular microvascular abnormalities on optical coherence tomography angiography and silent cerebral infarctions (SCIs) on cerebral magnetic resonance imaging in sickle cell disease. METHODS: Patients (age <18 years old) from our previous pediatric sickle cell disease study cohort who had prior optical coherence tomography angiography and brain magnetic resonance imaging were identified. Brain magnetic resonance imaging images were compared with macular optical coherence tomography angiography scans to identify macular vascular density differences between patients with SCI and without SCI. RESULTS: Sixty-eight eyes from 34 patients who underwent optical coherence tomography angiography were evaluated, of whom 28 eyes from 14 patients met the inclusion criteria for this study. Eight patients (57%) with SCI and 6 patients (43%) without SCI were identified. The mean age (17 years in SCI and 16.3 years in non-SCI) was comparable between groups. There was no statistically significant difference in systemic complications. Deep capillary plexus vessel density was lower in the temporal quadrant in patients with SCI (49.3% vs. 53.7%, P = 0.014). CONCLUSION: Patients with SCI were found to have lower vessel density in the deep capillary plexus compared with those without SCI. This finding suggests that deep capillary plexus vessel density may have utility as an imaging biomarker to predict the presence of SCI.
34131902	treat|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell	What drives transcranial Doppler velocity improvement in paediatric sickle cell anaemia: analysis from the Sickle Cell Clinical Research and Intervention Program (SCCRIP) longitudinal cohort study.Children with sickle cell anaemia (SCA) and conditional transcranial Doppler (TCD) flow velocities (conditional: 170-199 cm/s; normal: <170 cm/s) have an increased risk of stroke. The Sickle Cell Clinical Research and Intervention Program (SCCRIP), a lifetime observational study, assessed the influence of haematological markers on TCD velocities. In children (<=16 years) with SCA (HbSS/HbSbeta0 -thalassaemia) and conditional TCD velocities (n = 32), increases in haemoglobin and in fetal haemoglobin after hydroxyurea initiation were significantly associated with decreases in TCD velocities. The benefit of pharmacological intervention to increase haemoglobin and fetal haemoglobin and normalise TCD velocities was demonstrated in this real-world dataset.

Inveterate anterior shoulder dislocation].THERAPEUTIC APPROACHES IN SICKLE CELL DISEASE. Sickle cell disease, the most common genetic disease in France, is still burdened with morbidity and early mortality before the age of 50. When the first-line treatment, hydroxyurea, is insufficient or in the case of organic damage(s) (in particular cerebral vasculopathy), a therapeutic intensification must be considered. New molecules are now available, such as voxelotor and crizanlizumab, but only hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation can cure the disease. Allogeneic HSC transplantation during childhood with a sibling donor is the reference but it is now possible to perform this procedure in adults with a reduced pre-transplant conditioning. Gene therapy, which consists of an autograft of genetically modified HSCs, has obtained promising results but has not yet demonstrated a complete cure of the disease (protocols underway). The toxicity of myeloablative conditioning (used in pediatrics or for gene therapy), particularly the sterility induced, and the risk of graft-versushost disease (for allogeneic transplantation) are limiting factors of these treatments.
35934593		Effective therapies for sickle cell disease: are we there yet?Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a common genetic blood disorder associated with acute and chronic pain, progressive multiorgan damage, and early mortality. Recent advances in technologies to manipulate the human genome, a century of research and the development of techniques enabling the isolation, efficient genetic modification, and reimplantation of autologous patient hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), mean that curing most patients with SCD could soon be a reality in wealthy countries. In parallel, ongoing research is pursuing more facile treatments, such as in-vivo-delivered genetic therapies and new drugs that can eventually be administered in low- and middle-income countries where most SCD patients reside.
34191365		Further evidence for the benefit of therapeutic plasma exchange for acute multi-organ failure syndrome refractory to red cell exchange in sickle cell disease.Acute multiorgan failure syndrome (MOFS) remains a significant cause of mortality in sickle cell disease (SCD) patients despite red cell exchange (RCE). In small case series and reports, therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) has shown benefit in MOFS. As further support for consideration of this modality, we present two patients with SCD and MOFS refractory to RCE who were subsequently treated with TPE. Fresh frozen plasma was used as the replacement fluid. Despite estimated hospital mortality of 40% at the time of intensive care unit admission, both patients showed marked clinical improvement with TPE treatment. Our cases add to the evidence supporting the potential inclusion of MOFS secondary to acute SCD as an indication for TPE in the next edition of the American Society of Apheresis Guidelines on the Use of Therapeutic Apheresis in Clinical Practice.
36857485		Echocardiographic Left Ventricular Hypertrophy and Geometric Patterns in Patients with Sickle Cell Anaemia.BACKGROUND: Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a common complication in patients with sickle cell anaemia (SCA), and it has been associated with systolic and diastolic dysfunction, and sudden death. There is a wide variation in the reported prevalence of LVH in patients with SCA, partly due to the varying criteria applied, and the impact of small weight and body surface area (BSA) in SCA patients. We used four different criteria to determine echocardiographic LVH and geometric patterns in patients with steady-state SCA. Left ventricular hypertrophy was defined by LVM, LVM indexed to BSA, LVM indexed to height and LVM indexed to height2.7 using gender-specific reference values. Left ventricular geometry was determined using LVH and relative wall thickness. RESULTS: Eighty-two patients with steady-state SCA, aged 18years and above were studied from January 2018 to April 2018. The median [IQR] age of the patients was 23 [10] years. Forty-seven (57.3%) were females. The prevalence of LVH was highest when LVM was indexed to BSA (80.5%), followed by LVM indexed to height (73.2%). Comparable prevalences of 68.3% and 69.5% were observed using LVM and LVM indexed to height2.7, respectively. The prevalence of LVH was similar in males and females for all the criteria. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of LVH is high among patients with steady-state SCA irrespective of the criteria applied. The most prevalent geometric pattern was eccentric LVH. Indexing to BSA might result in over-estimation of LVH given the relatively small BSA in patients with SCA. Indexing to height 2.7 might give a more accurate estimate of LVH.
35645211		Comparative evaluation of efficacy and safety of automated versus manual red cell exchange in sickle cell disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Exchange transfusion is a valuable treatment option in sickle cell disease (SCD) and is preferred over simple transfusion as it removes abnormal haemoglobin S (HbS) levels and reduces complications. This meta-analysis aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety profile of automated red cell exchange (aRBX) procedure over manual red cell exchange transfusion (MET) in SCD patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A standard meta-analysis protocol was developed, and after performing a comprehensive literature search in PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane and International Clinical Trial Registry Platform (ICTRP), reviewers assessed eligibility and extracted data from nine relevant studies. A random effects model was used to estimate the pooled effect size calculated from the mean difference in HbS percentage, serum ferritin level and risk ratio for the adverse events. Quality assessment was done using the risk-of-bias assessment tool, and a summary of observations was prepared using standard Cochrane methodology with GradePro GDT. RESULTS: The random-model analysis revealed a mean difference of 4.10 (95% CI: -3.29-11.49; Z = 1.09; p = 0.28) for HbS percentage, mean difference of 435.29 (95% CI: -73.74-944.32; Z = 1.68; p = 0.09) for serum ferritin and pooled risk ratio of 1.35 (95% CI: 0.63-2.87; Z = 0.77; p = 0.44) for adverse events. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis did not reveal any significant benefit of aRBX in reducing HbS percentage and attenuating the serum ferritin level when compared with MET. There was also no significant increased risk of adverse events detected in association with aRBX.
38181784		In vivo measurement of RBC survival in patients with sickle cell disease before or after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.Stable, mixed donor-recipient chimerism after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) is sufficient for phenotypic disease reversal and results from differences in donor/recipient red blood cell (RBC) survival. Understanding variability and predictors of RBC survival among patients with SCD before and after HSCT is critical for gene therapy research which seeks to generate sufficient corrected hemoglobin to reduce polymerization thereby overcoming the red cell pathology of SCD. This study utilized biotin-labeling of RBCs to determine the lifespan of RBCs in patients with SCD compared to patients who have successfully undergone curative HSCT, participants with sickle cell trait (HbAS), and healthy (HbAA) donors (NCT04476277). Twenty participants were included in the analysis (N=6 SCD pre-HSCT, N=5 SCD post-HSCT, N=6 HbAS, N=3 HbAA). The average RBC lifespan was significantly shorter for participants with SCD pre-HSCT (64.1 days, range 35-91) compared to those with SCD post-HSCT (113.4 days, range 105-119), HbAS (126.0 days, range 119-147), and HbAA (123.7 days, range 91-147) (p<0.001). RBC lifespan correlated with various hematologic parameters, and strongly correlated with the average final fraction of sickled RBCs after deoxygenation (p<0.001). No adverse events were attributable to the use of biotin and related procedures. Biotin labeling of RBCs is a safe and feasible methodology to evaluate RBC survival in patients with SCD before and after HSCT. Understanding differences in RBC survival may ultimately guide gene therapy protocols to determine hemoglobin composition required to reverse the SCD phenotype as it relates directly to RBC survival.
33951171		Occlusal Disorders in Patients with Sickle Cell Disease: Critical Literature Review.OBJECTIVE: To identify the association of occlusal disorders in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). STUDY DESIGN: A literature review was conducted, and articles published between 2010 and 2019 were searched on Bireme and PubMed websites and in MEDLINE and LILACS databases, in English, Portuguese, and Spanish, using the keywords "malocclusion," "sickle cell disease," and "cephalometry," combined by Boolean operators AND and OR. One of the criteria for the selection of articles was the presence of adolescents in the sample. This methodology followed the PRISMA recommendations. Seventy-nine articles were found, seven of which were included in the review as they met the inclusion criteria and the study goals. RESULTS: The prevalence of malocclusion in SCD patients ranged from 62.9% to 100%, which was considered very severe in 30.1% to 80.6%. The most common occlusal changes were Angle's class II malocclusion, increased maxillary overjet, and anterior open bite. In addition, class II skeletal pattern was the most prevalent due to mandibular retrusion. CONCLUSION: Malocclusion prevalence in SCD patients is high and considered to be a risk factor, with a significant rate of very severe malocclusion when compared to healthy patients.

Forty-three children (age 2-17 years) with baseline maximum time-averaged mean velocity (TAMV) >= 170 cm/s were stratified into three risk categories based on treatment status and stroke history: Group 1 (no history of stroke, on hydroxycarbamide, n = 12); and Groups 2 (no stroke, no hydroxycarbamide, n = 21) and 3 (previous stroke, no hydroxycarbamide, n = 10). Open-label hydroxycarbamide at 20 mg/kg/day was commenced, with escalation to maximum tolerated dose (MTD) based on mild marrow suppression (average dose 25 4 +- 4 5 mg/kg/day). TCD was performed every six months with brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) at baseline and after 18-months of hydroxycarbamide. The maximum TAMV decreased significantly compared to baseline (24 +- 30 cm/s, P < 0 0001), with similar declines in all groups. Clinical stroke occurred in five children, one in Group 1, none in Group 2, and four in Group 3, P = 0 0032, comparing group incidence rates. Brain MRI/MRA was stable in children without clinical stroke. EXTEND documents the feasibility and benefits of hydroxycarbamide at MTD to lower TCD velocities and reduce stroke risk in children with SCA and no history of primary stroke in low-resource settings without transfusion management.
33787937		Evidence for Prophylactic Transfusion during Pregnancy for Women with Sickle Cell Disease.The objective of this study was to examine prior studies on maternal and neonatal outcomes with prophylactic compared with emergent blood transfusion in pregnant women with sickle cell disease. A review of the literature was performed. Twenty-one articles were identified and included in the analysis. A generalized linear mixed-effects model was used to analyze the outcomes. Pregnancy outcomes assessed were preeclampsia, pneumonia, pyelonephritis, pain crises, intrauterine growth restriction, neonatal death, perinatal death, and maternal mortality. Women who underwent emergent transfusion were more likely than women who underwent prophylactic transfusion to have the following adverse perinatal outcomes: preterm delivery (adjusted odds ratio [aOR 2.04], 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14-3.63), pneumonia (aOR 2.98, 95% CI 1.44-6.15), pain crises (aOR 1.67, 95% CI 1.18-2.38), and perinatal death (aOR 1.84, 95% CI 1.06-3.07). Prophylactic transfusion should be reexamined as a potentially beneficial approach to the management of sickle cell disease in pregnancy.
35811546		Practices of sickle cell disease genetic screening and testing in the prenatal population.BACKGROUND: Genetic screening and testing are technologies historically underutilized in Black populations despite predicting diseases like sickle cell disease (SCD), which is predominantly found in Blacks. We surveyed prenatal patients to understand choices, beliefs and experiences surrounding genetic screening and testing, specifically for SCD. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we surveyed 322 women during prenatal visits. Responses were analyzed to identify barriers to care and education about testing and screening for SCD. Patients rated whether they agreed or disagreed with statements regarding sickle cell health behaviors. We used chi2 tests to compare categorical variables by self-reported race. Binary logistic regression was used to determine the odds ratios and confidence intervals for each outcome. RESULTS: Women were a mean (SD) age of 33.3 (6.1). 42.9% of patients self-identified as White while 41.3% of patients self- identified as Black. Screening questions were adjusted for differences in race, insurance, and education levels to show significant differences in responses between Blacks and Whites for screening for SCD (p = 0.047, OR 95% CI = 0.455 [0.210-0.989]) and plans to meet with genetic counselors (p = 0.049, OR 95% CI = 0.299 [0.090-0.993]). The statements "if sickle cell is not in their family, then it is likely not in themselves or their children," was significantly different between Black and White populations (p = 0.011, OR 95% CI = 0.207 [0.081-0.526]). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest gaps in screening, testing, education, and pregnancy management choices between Black and White patients. Research should focus on decreasing these healthcare gaps and improving education that address concerns about SCD for relevant populations.

To prevent iron overload toxicity in these patients, three iron chelators are currently FDA-approved for use: deferoxamine, deferasirox, and deferiprone. In the United States, deferiprone has been approved for three times daily dosing since 2011 and has recently gained approval for twice-daily administration. AREAS COVERED: A PubMed literature search was performed with the keywords 'deferiprone' and 'thalassemia.' Relevant original research studying deferiprone's effects on transfusional iron overload in patients with thalassemia syndromes was included. Exclusion criteria included case reports and review papers. Deferiprone is effective at reducing serum ferritin levels in patients with iron overload. Twice-daily administration provides a similar level of iron chelation as three times daily dosing with a comparable side effect profile and increased patient acceptability. EXPERT OPINION: New studies are highlighting deferiprone's potential for combination therapy with either deferoxamine or deferasirox to improve iron chelation. Deferiprone's ability to significantly decrease cardiac and liver iron content can be utilized in other transfusion-dependent hematologic conditions, as evidenced by its recent approval for use in the United States for sickle cell disease or other anemias.
36634737		Physical, Mental, and Social Health of Adult Patients with Sickle Cell Disease after Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation: A Mixed-Methods Study.Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) experience a considerable physical and psychosocial disease burden. In recent years, the application of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) to treat adults with SCD has increased. A thorough understanding of patients' physical, mental, and social health before and after cure is needed to meet the needs of this growing group of patients. We aimed to explore the perspectives of adult SCD patients on the changes in their experienced health and personal life goals after being cured. A mixed-methods approach was used, comprising a semistructured interview and a set of 9 Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) measures. Adult SCD patients who underwent HSCT at least 1 year earlier were eligible to participate in the study. Interviews were thematically analyzed using MAXQDA software. PROMIS T scores were compared with reference scores of the general population using SPSS Statistics. Ten patients participated in the study; their median age was 29.5 years (range, 19 to 49 years), and their median time since HSCT was 2.7 years (range, 1.0 to 3.5 years). Themes from the interviews were (1) pain/living pain free, (2) physical well-being, (3) mental well-being, (4) perspective/ outlook, (5) education/work, (6) family/friends, and (7) activities/participation. Following the PROMIS framework, we described these themes in a narrative synthesis according to health domain and categorized in 4 chronological time phases: before HSCT, first year post-transplantation, current situation, and future expectations. Physical health improved greatly, but transplantation-related toxicity, ongoing pain from avascular osteonecrosis, and fatigue negatively impacted quality of life in some patients. Furthermore, emotional struggles during the post-transplantation period were common, and patients expressed a need for psychological help. Patients reported improvements in social health and the ability to pursue personal life goals. The mean T scores of all PROMIS measures fell within the normal symptom limits compared with reference data of the general population, although, large variations were observed among the participants, matching our qualitative findings. In general, adult SCD patients experienced improved physical, mental, and social health after cure by HSCT and were able to pursue personal life goals. Yet they found themselves confronted with a new and unfamiliar reality that brought different challenges. Pain due to irreversible avascular osteonecrosis continued to have a negative impact. Clinicians should aim to help patients have realistic expectations before transplantation and offer timely psychological care.
36069612		Pulmonary hypertension screening in children with sickle cell disease.BACKGROUND: Screening for pulmonary hypertension (PHT) is recommended in children with sickle cell disease (SCD). However, best approaches are poorly described. We examined the utility of PHT symptoms, echocardiogram (ECHO), N-terminal-pro hormone brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), and BNP to screen for PHT in the SCD pediatric population. METHODS: Children (8-18 years old) with SCD-HbSS and HbSthal  were prospectively included and underwent PHT screening. The screening consisted of a comprehensive PHT symptoms evaluation, ECHO measurement, and NT-proBNP and BNP levels. RESULTS: A total of 73 patients were included (mean age 12 +- 5.7 years; >80% on hydroxyurea), of which 37% had a symptom consistent with PHT, including exertional dyspnea (26.5%), fatigue (17.6%), palpitation (14.7%), and chest pain (10.3%). ECHO was obtained in 53 (72.6%) patients, with only ECHO of 48 patients included in the final analysis. Elevated ECHO peak tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity (TRV) >2.5 m/s or indirect findings to suggest PHT were seen in only two of 48 (4.2%). No significant differences were seen between those with and without PHT symptoms when compared for NT-proBNP, BNP, hemoglobin, pulmonary function testing, fractional exhaled nitric oxide, asthma, oxygen saturation, and sleep apnea. CONCLUSION: PHT symptoms are not consistent with ECHO, NT-proBNP nor BNP findings in children with SCD. PHT prevalence based on TRV was low in children on hydroxyurea, therefore screening may not be warranted for this group.
36353243	associate|@CHEMICAL_Iron|@DISEASE_beta_Thalassemia	Fertility preservation for pediatric patients with hemoglobinopathies: Multidisciplinary counseling needed to optimize outcomes.Hemoglobinopathies are autosomal recessive disorders that occur when genetic mutations negatively impact the function of hemoglobin. Common hemoglobinopathies that are clinically significant include sickle cell disease, alpha thalassemia, and beta thalassemia. Advancements in disease-modifying and curative treatments for the common hemoglobinopathies over the past thirty years have led to improvements in patient quality of life and longevity for those who are affected. However, the diseases, their treatments and cures pose infertility risks, making fertility preservation counseling and treatment an important part of the contemporary comprehensive patient care. Sickle cell disease negatively impacts both male and female infertility, primarily by testicular failure and decreased ovarian reserve, respectively. Fertility in both males and females with beta thalassemia major are negatively impacted by iron deposition due to chronic blood transfusions. Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is currently the only curative treatment for SCD and transfusion dependent beta thalassemia. Many of the conditioning regimens for HSCT contain chemotherapeutic agents with known gonadotoxicity and whole-body radiation. Although most clinical studies on toxicity and impact of HSCT on long-term health do not evaluate fertility, gonadal failure is common. Male fertility preservation modalities that exist prior to gonadotoxic treatment include sperm banking for pubertal males and testicular cryopreservation for pre-pubertal boys. For female patients, fertility preservation options include oocyte cryopreservation and ovarian tissue cryopreservation. Oocyte cryopreservation requires controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) with ten to fourteen days of intensive monitoring and medication administration. This is feasible once the patient has undergone menarche. Follicular growth is monitored via transvaginal or transabdominal ultrasound, and hormone levels are monitored through frequent blood work. Oocytes are then harvested via a minimally invasive approach under anesthesia. Complications of COH are more common in patients with hemoglobinopathies. Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome creates a greater risk to patients with underlying vascular, pulmonary, and renal injury, as they may be less able to tolerate fluids shifts. Thus, it is critical to monitor patients undergoing COH closely with close collaboration between the hematology team and the reproductive endocrinology team. Counseling patients and families about future fertility must take into consideration the patient's disease, treatment history, and planned treatment, acknowledging current knowledge gaps.
38066927		Gene therapy for sickle cell disease.Sickle cell disease (SCD) is potentially curable after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or autologous HSCT after ex vivo genetic modification. Autologous HSCT with gene therapy has the potential to overcome many of the limitations of allogeneic HSCT that include the lack of suitable donors, graft-versus-host disease, the need for immune suppression, and the potential for graft rejection. Significant progress in gene therapy for SCD has been made over the past several decades, now with a growing number of clinical trials investigating various gene addition and gene editing strategies. Available results from a small number of patients, some with relatively short follow-up, are promising as a potentially curative strategy, with current efforts focused on continuing to improve the efficacy, durability, and safety of gene therapies for the cure of SCD.

33823751		Health beliefs as a predictor of screening behaviors among college students.Twenty million people live with a sickle cell disease (SCD) diagnosis globally; about 100,000 reside in the United States of America (US). Although SCD continues to threaten the health, mostly of particular groups in the US, there is a lack of knowledge on risk factors such as unawareness of carrier status, inheritance patterns, and resistance to SCT screening among childbearing age individuals. A cross-sectional survey design using a modified version of the Health Belief Survey assessed college students' SCD beliefs and screening behaviors. Four hundred sixteen students from a North Texas university campus participated in the survey. Although most participants believed that knowing their carrier status was important, only 26% were aware of their status. Findings demonstrated that health beliefs were a significant predictor of screening behaviors. The Universal, Selective, and Indicated Prevention Approach was suggested as a suitable approach to educate, transform health beliefs, and augment screening participation.
34256313		Reliability of different estimated glomerular filtration rate as measures of renal function in children with sickle cell disease.BACKGROUND: There is no reliable marker for detecting early renal disease in early children with sickle cell disease (SCD). Estimation of glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) as derived from the height/plasma creatinine formula is dependent on the accuracy of the creatinine analytical method used. The aim of this study was to evaluate different equations for eGFR. METHODS: Children aged 5-16 years recruited. mGFR was obtained using plasma disappearance of Inutest/Iohexol, serum creatinine (SCr) was measured either by standard laboratory method or by tandem mass spectrometry (MSMS). Estimated GFR was then calculated either by "Bedside Schwartz method" or by the full-age spectrum (FAS) equation. FINDINGS: A total of 79 patients (mean age 9.8 +- 4.0 years). A revised eGFR constant was calculated for Schwartz equation from the slope of the plot of height/plasma creatinine versus mGFR. Mean values for mGFR (132.7 +- 32.1 ml/min/1.73m2) and eGFR methods compared: eGFR from standard SCr was significantly higher (144.2 +- 37.3 ml/min/1.73m2, p = 0.008). The MSMS eGFR showed the lowest SD (SD = 27.5), while both FAS eGFR and FAS-height eGFR showed the highest correlation coefficient (r = 0.67). INTERPRETATION: eGFR calculation based on height and SCr determined with MSMS traceable creatinine is more reliable than Schwartz formula using jaffe/enzymatic methods in SCD children.
36633226		Emergency department visits and hospitalizations for pediatric vaso-occlusive pain events during the COVID-19 pandemic.The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic altered all aspects of life, including healthcare. During the pandemic, social distancing led to decreased transmission of typical viral illnesses, leading to a decrease in these pediatric admissions. Studies have shown that pediatric emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations decreased during the pandemic, which may have led to some unmet healthcare needs and delays in treatment. Little is known about the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on ED visits and hospitalizations specifically for pediatric sickle cell pain. A retrospective review across hospitals in the Northwell Health system was conducted to compare the ED visits and hospitalizations for pediatric patients with sickle cell pain during 2020 (the year of the pandemic), the following year (2021), and the 2 years prior to the pandemic (2018, 2019). The average length of stay for patients hospitalized with vaso-occlusive events was also compared between these years. Total 511 patient encounters for patients seen and discharged home from the ED and 985 hospitalization encounters were included over the 4-year timespan. ED visits per year decreased significantly in 2020 compared with the 2 years prior (p < .001): 91 visits in 2020, 162 visits in 2019, and 143 visits in 2018. The number of ED visits for pediatric vaso-occlusive events trended upward in 2021 to 115. Hospitalizations also decreased in 2020 compared to the 2 years prior (n = 202 vs 196; p < .001), compared with 298 in 2019 and 289 in 2018. The number of patients hospitalized remained stable in 2021 (n = 202 vs 196). There was a statistically significant increase in the median length of stay in 2020 compared to years prior (p = .002): median (interquartile range [IQR]): 4.0 days (2-6 days) in 2020 compared to 3.0 days (2-5 days) in 2018 and 2019. ED encounters and hospitalizations for pediatric patients with sickle cell disease pain decreased during the pandemic; however, admitted patients had a longer median length of stay.
34905048		Investigational curative gene therapy approaches to sickle cell disease.Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited blood condition resulting from abnormal hemoglobin production. It is one of the most common genetic diseases in the world. The clinical manifestations are variable and range from recurrent acute and debilitating painful crises to life-threatening pulmonary, cardiovascular, renal, and neurologic complications. The only curative treatment of SCD at this time is bone marrow transplantation (also called hematopoietic stem cell transplantation) using healthy blood stem cells from an unaffected brother or sister or from an unrelated donor if one can be identified who is a match in tissue typing. Unfortunately, only a minority of patients with sickle cell has such a donor available. The use of autologous hematopoietic stem cells and alternative types of genetic modifications is currently under study in clinical research trials for this disease. The approaches include the use of viral vectors to express globin genes that are modified to prevent sickle hemoglobin polymerization or to express interfering RNAs to "flip the switch" in adult red cells from adult beta-sickle hemoglobin to fetal hemoglobin using a physiologic switch, and several gene editing approaches with the goal of inducing fetal hemoglobin or correcting/modifying the actual sickle mutation. In this audio review, we will discuss these different approaches and review the current progress of curative therapy for SCD using gene therapy.
34848756		Nationwide retrospective study of critically ill adults with sickle cell disease in France.Little is known about patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) who require intensive care unit (ICU) admission. The goals of this study were to assess outcomes in patients admitted to the ICU for acute complications of SCD and to identify factors associated with adverse outcomes. This multicenter retrospective study included consecutive adults with SCD admitted to one of 17 participating ICUs. An adverse outcome was defined as death or a need for life-sustaining therapies (non-invasive or invasive ventilation, vasoactive drugs, renal replacement therapy, and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). Factors associated with adverse outcomes were identified by mixed multivariable logistic regression. We included 488 patients admitted in 2015-2017. The main reasons for ICU admission were acute chest syndrome (47.5%) and severely painful vaso-occlusive event (21.3%). Sixteen (3.3%) patients died in the ICU, mainly of multi-organ failure following a painful vaso-occlusive event or sepsis. An adverse outcome occurred in 81 (16.6%; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 13.3%-19.9%) patients. Independent factors associated with adverse outcomes were low mean arterial blood pressure (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.98; 95% CI 0.95-0.99; p = 0.027), faster respiratory rate (aOR, 1.09; 95% CI 1.05-1.14; p < 0.0001), higher haemoglobin level (aOR, 1.22; 95% CI 1.01-1.48; p = 0.038), impaired creatinine clearance at ICU admission (aOR, 0.98; 95% CI 0.97-0.98; p < 0.0001), and red blood cell exchange before ICU admission (aOR, 5.16; 95% CI 1.16-22.94; p = 0.031). Patients with SCD have a substantial risk of adverse outcomes if they require ICU admission. Early ICU admission should be encouraged in patients who develop abnormal physiological parameters.
37585480		Comparison of Thromboembolism Outcomes in Patients with Sickle Cell Disease Prescribed Hormonal Contraception.Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) are at risk of thromboembolism (TE) and use of hormonal contraception can further increase that risk. This study aims to assess patterns of hormonal contraceptive use and compare risk of contraception-related TE between combined hormonal contraceptives (CHC) and progestin-only contraceptives (POC). Patients with SCD between 12-44 years with a new prescription of a hormonal contraceptive in the CMS MAX database (2006-2018) were followed for one year. Cox regression analysis was used to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) of TE. We identified 7,173 new users: 44.6% initiated CHC and 55.4% initiated POC. Combined oral contraceptive pills (OCP) (36.5%) and progestin-only depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (33.9%) were the most frequently prescribed agents. A total of 1.8% of contraception users had a new diagnosis of TE within one year of first identified contraception prescription. There were no significant differences in TE event rates between CHC and POC users (17.2 and 24.7 events per 1000 person-years respectively, adjusted HR=0.83, 95% CI: 0.58-1.21; p-value=0.336). In patients prescribed OCP, there were no differences in TE event rates based on estrogen dose or progestin generation. Transdermal patch had 2.4 fold increased risk of TE as compared to OCP. Although limited by the retrospective study design and use of administrative claims data, this study found no significant differences in TE rates between new users of CHC and POC in patients with SCD. Careful evaluation of underlying TE risk factors should be considered in each patient with SCD prior to initiation of hormonal contraception.
34107826		Prolonged QTc Interval in Nigerian Children with Sickle Cell Anemia.Prolonged QTc interval, a risk factor for ventricular arrhythmia, occurs in sickle cell anemia. The aim of this study was to determine the risk of prolonged QTc interval and its relationship with vaso-occlusive painful crises (VOCs) and follow-up steady-state in the same children with sickle cell anemia. This prospective cohort study enrolled 38 subjects, aged 5-17 years. History of bone pain and examination were obtained during VOC and steady-state. Assessment of QTc interval was with 12-lead electrocardiography. The QTc interval value >0.440 seconds was taken as prolonged. Median (interquartile range) of QTc interval was higher during VOC [0.447 (0.438-0.459) seconds] than during steady-state [0.435 (0.417-0.440) seconds]. Risk of prolonged QTc interval was higher during VOC (68.4%) than in steady-state (21.1%) with relative risk of 3.250 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.692-6.241]. Prolonged QTc interval was likely to occur [area under curve (AUC) = 0.759, p<0.001] during VOC with 68.4% sensitivity, 78.9% specificity and at cutoff point of 0.441 seconds. Prolonged QTc interval negatively correlated with packed cell volume (PCV) during VOC [rs (36) = -0.14, p = 0.387]. Binary logistics of the combined effect of PCV and gender on QTc interval showed that during VOC, males were more likely to have prolonged QTc [odds ratio (OR): 1.337 (95% CI: 0.327-5.464; p = 0.686]. Children with sickle cell anemia, particularly males, were three-times more likely to have prolonged QTc interval during VOC when QTc interval was >0.441 seconds. Routine electrocardiography may help to identify those with QTc intervals above this threshold for prompt cardiac-oriented management.
33690845		Implementation of Individualized Pain Care Plans Decreases Length of Stay and Hospital Admission Rates for High Utilizing Adults with Sickle Cell Disease.OBJECTIVE: Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) face inconsistent effective analgesic management, leading to high inpatient healthcare utilization and significant financial burden for healthcare institutions. Current evidence does not provide guidance for inpatient management of acute pain in adults with sickle cell disease. We conducted a retrospective analysis of a longitudinal cohort quality improvement project to characterize the role of individualized care plans on improving patient care and reducing financial burden in high healthcare-utilizing patients with SCD-related pain. METHODS: Individualized care plans were developed for patients with hospital admissions resulting from pain associated with sickle cell disease. A 2-year prospective longitudinal cohort quality improvement project was performed and retrospectively analyzed. Primary outcome measure was duration of hospitalization. Secondary outcome measures included: pain intensity; 7, 30, and 90-day readmission rates; cost per day; total admissions; total cost per year; analgesic regimen at index admission; and discharge disposition. RESULTS: Duration of hospitalization, the primary outcome, significantly decreased by 1.23 days with no worsening of pain intensity scores. Seven-day readmission decreased by 34%. Use of intravenous hydromorphone significantly decreased by 25%. The potential cost saving was $1,398,827 as a result of this quality initiative. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of individualized care plans reduced both admission rate and financial burden of high utilizing patients. Importantly, pain outcomes were not diminished. Results suggest that individualized care plans are a promising strategy for managing acute pain crisis in adult sickle cell patients from both care-focused and utilization outcomes.
37696002		Identifying Barriers to HPV Vaccination for Patients With Sickle Cell Disease and Childhood Cancer Survivors.Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination prevents the development of HPV-associated malignancies. Adolescent and young adult survivors of childhood cancers and patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) are vulnerable patient populations who would significantly benefit from HPV vaccination. In this multimethod study, a retrospective chart review found a notable difference between the rate of HPV vaccinations and other age-appropriate vaccinations in 177 childhood cancer survivors and in 70 patients with SCD. We then sought to describe patient and caregiver beliefs regarding HPV vaccination, through semistructured interviews with 21 patients and 48 caregivers. Interviews were analyzed with a thematic content approach to understand attitudes regarding the HPV vaccination. Qualitative interviews noted that many caregivers and adolescents had baseline misconceptions regarding the HPV vaccination in general and in context with their chronic illness. It was found that a strong recommendation from a trusted subspecialty provider would create reassurance about vaccination and reduce misconceptions and concerns about side effects in the context of a chronic illness. Counseling from subspecialists could have a strong impact on understanding the HPV vaccine in the context of chronic illness. This would likely help overcome many of the barriers to vaccination that are encountered by patients with SCD or oncology survivors.
34327799		The health literacy disparity in adolescents with sickle cell disease.PURPOSE: There are over 100,000 individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD) in the United States, most of whom are Black, poor, and publically insured. In combination with a chronic illness, these demographics lead to significant barriers to healthcare for patients with SCD, leaving them exceptionally vulnerable within the healthcare system. This unique vulnerability is especially notable when transitioning adolescents with SCD from pediatric to adult care, as this is a significant time of morbidity and mortality for these patients. It is postulated that health literacy influences transition from pediatric to adult care in adolescents with SCD. To better understand this relationship, more adolescent health literacy research must be conducted with both adolescents with and without SCD. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to systematically compare health literacy in adolescents with and without SCD. DESIGN AND METHODS: This is a cross-sectional, descriptive, exploratory study. One hundred and thirty-four adolescents with SCD and 105 adolescents without SCD were recruited for this study. The Newest Vital Sign (NVS) health literacy instrument was used to evaluate health literacy. Pearson correlations were conducted to evaluate relationships among health literacy and the influencing factors of age, grade level, income, and parental education level. Differences in NVS scores between groups were assessed using independent samples t tests. RESULTS: There was a significant relationship between health literacy, age (r = .286, p < .01) and grade level (r = .317, p = .00) in adolescents with SCD. In adolescents without SCD, there was a significant relationship between health literacy, income (r = .235; p < .05) and parental education (r = .263; p < .01). The mean NVS score was 2.66 for adolescents with SCD and 3.77 for adolescents without SCD. A statistically significant difference in NVS scores was found between groups (t = 4.772; p < .001). Adolescents with SCD demonstrated significantly lower NVS scores than adolescents without SCD. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: There are significant differences in health literacy scores and influencing factors in adolescents with and without SCD. Thus, this article provides unique insight for nurses as they design, implement and evaluate health promotion, patient education, and future research initiatives for adolescents and families, both with and without SCD. Further research is needed to gain more insight into this phenomenon.
34487854		[Erythrapheresis in children with sickle cell disease, experience of a paediatric apheresis unit].Erythrocyte exchanges on cell separators can be used in children with sickle cell disease and are effective in lowering the level of haemoglobin S. Of the 938 aphereses performed in 2020 in our unit, we observed a low rate of failure of procedures and few complications. Ninety-six percent of erythraphereses were performed in the context of chronic exchange programs, in more than 80% of cases for cerebral vasculopathy or after the occurrence of ischemic strokes. Less than 4% of the procedures were performed for specific indications (preparation for cholecystectomy most often). The vascular access is rarely an obstacle to the realisation of the apheresis. In case of insufficient venous capital, installing an arteriovenous fistula may be considered. Depending on the child's weight, haemoglobin level, and the severity of the sickle cell anaemia, precautions may be necessary when priming the procedure. Nurses experienced in paediatric apheresis and a good medical knowledge of sickle cell disease allowed us to use this technique from the age of 3years and the weight of 15kg.

37933199		Imaging of pediatric skull lytic lesions: A review.Skull lesions in pediatric population are common findings on imaging and sometimes with heterogeneous manifestations, constituting a diagnostic challenge. Some lesions can be misinterpreted for their aggressiveness, as with larger lesions eroding cortical bone, containing soft tissue components, leading to excessive and, in some cases, invasive inappropriate etiological investigation. In this review, we present multiple several conditions that may present as skull lesions or pseudolesions, organized by groups (anatomic variants, congenital and development disorders, traumatic injuries, vascular issues, infectious conditions, and tumoral processes). Anatomic variants are common imaging findings that must be recognized by the neuroradiologist. Congenital malformations are rare conditions, such as aplasia cutis congenita and sinus pericranii, usually seen at earlier ages, the majority of which are benign findings. In case of trauma, cephalohematoma, growing skull fractures, and posttraumatic lytic lesions should be considered. Osteomyelitis tends to be locally aggressive and may mimic malignancy, in which cases, the clinical history can be the key to diagnosis. Vascular (sickle cell disease) and tumoral (aneurismal bone cyst, eosinophilic granuloma, metastases) lesions are relatively rare lesions but should be considered in the differential diagnosis, in the presence of certain imaging findings. The main difficulty is the differentiation between the benign and malignant nature; therefore, the main objective of this pictorial essay is to review the main skull lytic lesions found in pediatric age, describing the main findings in different imaging modalities (CT and MRI), allowing the neuroradiologist greater confidence in establishing the differential diagnosis, through a systematic and simple characterization of the lesions.
34585199		Point-of-care microchip electrophoresis for integrated anemia and hemoglobin variant testing.Anemia affects over 25% of the world's population with the heaviest burden borne by women and children. Genetic hemoglobin (Hb) variants, such as sickle cell disease, are among the major causes of anemia. Anemia and Hb variant are pathologically interrelated and have an overlapping geographical distribution. We present the first point-of-care (POC) platform to perform both anemia detection and Hb variant identification, using a single paper-based electrophoresis test. Feasibility of this new integrated diagnostic approach is demonstrated via testing individuals with anemia and/or sickle cell disease. Hemoglobin level determination is performed by an artificial neural network (ANN) based machine learning algorithm, which achieves a mean absolute error of 0.55 g dL-1 and a bias of -0.10 g dL-1 against the gold standard (95% limits of agreement: 1.5 g dL-1) from Bland-Altman analysis on the test set. Resultant anemia detection is achieved with 100% sensitivity and 92.3% specificity. With the same tests, subjects with sickle cell disease were identified with 100% sensitivity and specificity. Overall, the presented platform enabled, for the first time, integrated anemia detection and hemoglobin variant identification using a single point-of-care test.
35535578		Vaccination in Pediatric Patients with Sickle-Cell Disease: Uptake Report and Mini-Review.BACKGROUND: Brazil has one of the highest numbers of births with sickle-cell disease (SCD) in the Americas. Despite the risk of severe illnesses and death due to both vaccine-preventable infections, vaccination uptake in pediatric patients with SCD is unknown. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Children under 18 years with SCD presenting to routine medical consultations had their vaccination status evaluated according to the national recommendations. Data obtained were classified as 'Adequate', 'Delayed' or 'Missing' vaccination and compared among age groups. RESULTS: From 117 children screened, 100 had their vaccination card available. Vaccination coverage of routine vaccines was above 95% for all primary series and both age groups, with varied rates of delays and low missing doses. Among SCD extended vaccination, the most frequently delayed and missed vaccines were those specifically recommended to individuals with SCD as per national guidelines-and particularly those against encapsulated bacteria. Significant and varied rates of missing doses occurred in primary series and booster doses for PPSV23, Hib, menC, hepatitis A and varicella. The average influenza vaccination rate was 69.5%, with higher rates among younger children. CONCLUSIONS: Children with SCD have alarming under-vaccination rates. Basic prevention strategies in Brazil should be reassessed in this specific population.

35285420		Correlates of transfusion transmissible infections among patients with sickle cell disease in Nigeria: case-control study.Transfusion transmissible infections (TTIs) such as Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) are among the most frequent complications in individuals with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD). We investigated factors associated with TTIs in SCD patients and controls in South-west Nigeria. A total of 2,034 participants with or without SCD were recruited in a matched case-control study. HIV, HBV and HCV infections were diagnosed using commercialy available ELISA kits (Biorad, Paris). Samples positive for HIV ELISA were further confirmed using Western blot. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, paired/independent t-test and logistic regression at p = .05. Proportion with HBV was higher among those with multiple sexual partners (12.7%), tattoo/body incision (11.8%), and sharing of sharp objects (7.3%), but HIV was only higher among participants with history of tattoo/body incision (1.5%). Prevalence of TTIs was similar among participants with or without transfusion. History of sharing sharp objects (adjusted odds ratios (aOR) = 1.72; 95%CI:1.11-2.66) and tattoo/body incision (aOR = 1.89; 95%CI:1.22-2.94) almost doubled the risk of HBV. TTIs are endemic in the studied area. Certain lifestyles predispose people to TTIs than having blood transfusion. Population-based intervention targeting lifestyle changes may reduce the risk of TTIs in the study area.Abbrveviations AA: Hemoglobin AA; AC: Hemoglobin AC; aOR: adjusted Odds Ratios; AS: Hemoglobin AS; CHOP: Children Outpatient; CI: Confidence Interval; EDTA: Ethylenediamine Tetraacetic Acid; GOP: General Outpatient; HBV: Hepatitis B Virus; HCV: Hepatitis C Virus; HIV: Human Immunodeficiency Virus; HPLC: High Performance Liquid Chromatography; IAMRAT: Advanced Medical Research & Training; IDU: Injection Drug Use; MOP: Medical Outpatient; SC: Hemoglobin SC; SCD: Sickle cell disease; SD: Standard Deviation; SF: Hemoglobin SF; SS: Hemoglobin SS; STDs: Sexually Transmitted Diseases; TTI: Transfusion transmissible infections; UCH: University College Hospital Ibadan; UI: University of Ibadan.
33683802		Pregnancy outcome in homozygous sickle cell disease: observations from the Jamaican Birth Cohort.OBJECTIVE: To document pregnancy outcome in homozygous sickle cell (SS) disease and in age-matched controls with a normal haemoglobin genotype followed from birth for up to 45 years. METHODS: A total of 100 000 consecutive non-operative deliveries screened for sickle cell disease at the main Government maternity hospital in Kingston, Jamaica between 1973 and 1981 detected 311 (149 female) babies with SS disease who were matched by age and gender with 250 (129 female) controls with an AA haemoglobin phenotype. These individuals have been followed from birth with prospective assessment of menarche and detailed documentation of all pregnancies. RESULTS: There were 177 pregnancies in 71 SS patients and 226 pregnancies in 74 AA controls. Mothers with SS disease had more spontaneous abortions (adjusted relative risk [aRR] 3.2, 95% CI 1.6-6.1), fewer live births (aRR 0.7, 95% CI 0.6-0.9) and their offspring were more likely to have a gestational age <37 weeks (aRR 2.1, 95% CI 1.1-3.7) and low birthweight <2.5 kg (aRR 3.0, 95% CI 1.6-5.3). They were more prone to acute chest syndrome (aRR 13.7, 95% CI 4.1-45.5), urinary tract infection (aRR 12.8, 95% CI 1.3-125.9), pre-eclampsia/eclampsia (aRR 3.1, 95% CI 1.1-8.8), retained placenta (aRR 10.1, 95% CI 1.1-90.3), sepsis (Fisher's Exact test 0.04) and pregnancy-related deaths (Fisher's Exact test 0.02). Four of five deaths were attributable to acute chest syndrome. There was no genotypic difference in pregnancy-induced hypertension or postpartum haemorrhage. CONCLUSION: Pregnancy in SS disease carries risks for both mother and child. The variable characteristics of pregnancy-related deaths complicate their prevention. TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: Pregnancy in SS disease compared with controls showed increased abortions and stillbirths, fewer live births and maternal deaths in 7% patients.
35724398		COVID19 vaccination in adults with sickle cell disease is not associated with increases in rates of pain crisis.ABSTRACTPeople with sickle cell disease (SCD) are more vulnerable to hospitalization, pneumonia, and pain following COVID-19 infection. However, given the association between the inflammatory response and vaso-occlusive crises in SCD and a case report of vaso-occlusive crises following administration of the ChAdOx1 nCov-195-7/AstraZeneca vaccine, there is concern that the administration of COVID-19 vaccines in people with SCD might provoke a vaso-occlusive crisis. To address this critical gap in knowledge, we sought to examine acute care usage for vaso-occlusive crisis and frequency and severity of side effects following COVID-19 vaccination among patients at the Montefiore Sickle Cell Center for Adults. As part of regular care, patients were asked if they had received COVID-19 vaccination and any side effects were noted. Electronic medical records were reviewed for the type of vaccine, dates received, episodes of vaso-occlusive crises within seven days of a dose, and side effects noted. The risk of average hospital utilization per week in 2019 was calculated as a baseline. We found that fewer than 1 in 10 patients presented to the hospital within seven days of vaccination and that the risk of hospital utilization was similar to the average risk in a week in 2019. Of patients who reported side effects, one reported a possible case of sensorineural hearing loss otherwise no other rare side effects, including thrombosis or death, were reported.
36628629		How do we operate a large monthly red blood cell exchange program.BACKGROUND: Red blood cell (RBC) exchange for sickle cell disease presents unique difficulties due to RBC phenotyping, complex antibody work-ups, large number of RBC units required, and vascular access considerations, any of which can delay the procedure. Multidisciplinary coordination and systemic processes ensure that monthly appointments remain on schedule. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A high-volume chronic RBC exchange program is described, highlighting the importance of multidisciplinary coordination and process improvement strategies involving initial referral, vascular access, order sets, and allocation of antigen-negative or phenotypically matched RBCs. RESULTS: Approximately 50 outpatient RBC exchanges are performed each month with an 82% kept-appointment rate. Specific factors for program success include open communication across services and improvements to referrals and standardized order sets. CONCLUSION: A combination of multidisciplinary coordination and process improvement can ensure the success of a high volume RBC exchange program. Frequent communication of upcoming appointments between the referring hematologists, the hemapheresis clinic, transfusion service, and interventional radiology is critical. Advance notice to the immunohematology reference lab of upcoming appointments is needed to allow enough time for allocating antigen-negative RBCs. Order sets can be leveraged to standardize and streamline RBC exchanges. Lastly, numerous mechanisms help patients compensate for the cognitive sequelae of stroke.

35708432	treat|@CHEMICAL_Proguanil|@DISEASE_Malaria ;treat|@CHEMICAL_Proguanil|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell	Uptake and usage of proguanil as malaria chemoprophylaxis and the socio-economic determinants of proguanil usage in children with sickle cell anemia in Benin City.Background: Proguanil is currently the recommended drug used for malaria chemoprophylaxis in children with Sickle cell anaemia (SCA). Aims: This study aims to determine the uptake and usage of proguanil as malaria chemoprophylaxis and the socioeconomic determinants of its usage in children aged 6-59 months. This was a descriptive cross-sectional study carried out in two major sickle cell clinics in Benin City, Edo state, Nigeria. A total of 420 participants were interviewed using semistructured questionnaires. Patients and Methods: Descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate analysis of quantitative data were done using SPSS version 21. Results: The uptake of proguanil among study participants was 67.4%; of these number, 268 (94.7%) reported daily use of proguanil. Only 3 (0.7%) used pyrimethamine as chemoprophylaxis, while 134 (31.9%) used no form of malaria chemoprophylaxis. Having mothers with higher level of education (LOE) (P = 0.013, odds ratio [OR] = 1.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.15-3.17), attending clinic at the University of Benin Teaching Hospital (UBTH) (P = 0.044, OR = 2.15, 95% CI = 1.02-4.54), older age group (36-59 months) (P = 0.015, OR = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.11-2.51), and owning insecticide-treated net (ITN) (P = 0.000, OR = 3.11, 95% CI = 1.98-4.88) were significant positive predictors for the usage of proguanil. Conclusion: Proguanil uptake was low. Attending sickle-cell clinic at UBTH, having mothers with tertiary LOE, and owning ITN were social factors associated with high usage of proguanil amongst children with SCA. Continuous monitoring and evaluation of the uptake and usage of proguanil in children is important, so as to aid policy implementation and review.
35129289		Changes in the developmental status of preschoolers with sickle cell disease.Developmental monitoring and screening are recommended strategies for identifying children with sickle cell disease at high risk for cerebrovascular complications. Studies examining developmental screenings have provided little data on change over time. We examined screenings longitudinally in 43 children screened as two-year-olds and four-year-olds using the Ages and Stages Questionnaire, 2nd edition. Only two-thirds of children had stable screening outcomes. A new onset of cerebrovascular complications predicted the emergence of developmental delay (P = 0.017). Multivariate analysis suggested a benefit from formal developmental interventions. Regular developmental screening during the preschool period is important to identify systematic changes in developmental status.
35952551		Electrocardiographic findings in Nigerian athletes with the sickle cell trait.BACKGROUND: In spite of the high prevalence of the sickle cell trait (SCT) in Nigeria, the electrocardiographic characteristics of SCT athletes remain unknown. OBJECTIVE: To compare the electrocardiographic findings in athletes of the University of Port Harcourt based on hemoglobin genotype. METHODS: 76 athletes (41 males, 35 females) were recruited. All had normal ECGs and echocardiograms. The prevalence of SCT was 31.6%. RESULTS: Mean heart rate was lower among the SCT athletes (57.3 [8.6] vs 64.6 [10.4] beats/min; p = .002; Hedges' g = 0.74). Mean T-wave axis was also higher among SCT athletes (39.1 [12.8] vs 32.3 [12.9] degrees; p = .036 Hedges' g = 0.53). CONCLUSION: SCT is associated with significant electrocardiographic changes in Nigerian athletes. The biological basis and clinical significance of these changes are presently uncertain.
36849230		Mortality Rates and autopsy findings in fat embolism syndrome complicating sickle cell disease.Fat embolism syndrome is a rare but underdiagnosed complication of sickle cell disease associated with high morbidity and mortality. It affects predominantly patients with a previously mild course of their illness and those of non-SS genotypes while there is possibly an association with infection with human parvovirus B19 (HPV B19). Here, we present the mortality rates and autopsy findings of all reported cases to date. A systematic review has revealed 99 published cases in the world literature with a mortality rate of 46%. Mortality varied greatly according to the time of reported cases with no survivors in the 1940s, 1950s or 1960s and no deaths since 2020. 35% of cases had previously undiagnosed sickle cell disease and the latter was only identified at autopsy after developing fat embolism with a fatal outcome. 20% of cases reported after 1986 tested positive for HPV B19 with an associated mortality of 63% whereas in cases that have not documented HPV B19 infection the mortality was 32%. The organs most often staining positive for fat were the kidneys, lungs, brain and heart whereas ectopic haematopoietic tissue was found in 45% of the examined lung specimens.
36535408		Fetal allotransplant recipients are resistant to graft-versus-host disease.In utero hematopoietic cell transplantation (IUHCT) is an experimental treatment for congenital hemoglobinopathies, including Sickle cell disease and thalassemias. One of the principal advantages of IUHCT is the predisposition of the developing fetus toward immunologic tolerance. This allows for engraftment across immune barriers without immunosuppression and, potentially, decreased susceptibility to graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). We demonstrate fetal resistance to GVHD following T cell-replete allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation compared with the neonate. We show that this resistance is associated with elevated fetal serum interleukin-10 conducive to the induction of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Finally, we demonstrate that the adoptive transfer of Tregs from IUHCT recipients to neonates uniformly prevents GVHD, recapitulating the predisposition to tolerance observed after fetal allotransplantation. These findings demonstrate fetal resistance to GVHD following hematopoietic cell transplantation and elucidate Tregs as important contributors.
37205803		Current Evidence and Rationale to Guide Perioperative Management, Including Transfusion Decisions, in Patients With Sickle Cell Disease.Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a collection of inherited hemoglobin disorders that results in chronic hemolytic anemia, vaso-occlusion, pain, and end organ damage. Surgery in the SCD population requires careful planning, as perioperative stressors can lead to increased sickling and risk of inducing or further exacerbating vaso-occlusive episodes (VOEs). Additionally, the underlying hypercoagulability and immunocompromised state due to SCD places patients at increased risk of both venous thromboembolism and infection. Judicious fluid administration, temperature regulation, thorough preoperative and postoperative analgesic planning, and preoperative transfusion are all crucial components of decreasing risks of surgery in patients with SCD.
37541536		Chronic Pain Management in Sickle Cell Disease: A Systematic Scoping Review of Controlled Trials.Existing treatment for chronic pain in sickle cell disease (SCD) is opioid-dependent, which is ineffective and carries risks. We conducted a scoping literature review to assess the size and scope of available literature about controlled trials of therapies for SCD chronic pain and identify research gaps. The search strategy in PubMed and EMBASE utilized keywords for chronic pain and sickle cell and identified seven original articles that met inclusion criteria. Six of the studies recruited from clinics while one recruited from community sources. Cannabis and behavioral modification were associated with improvements in pain scores. However, existing evidence does not represent best practices for assessing chronic pain, and this along with small sample sizes prevents translation to clinical care. The limited evidence concerning treatment for SCD chronic pain highlights the need for larger trials of opioid alternatives and the utilization of chronic pain measures that capture nociplastic pain in SCD.

34749584		A Case of Fat Embolism Syndrome with Cerebral Involvement in Sickle Cell Anemia.Fat embolism syndrome (FES) is a rare condition that can occur as a complication of sickle cell disease. We describe a case of a patient with sickle cell disease (homozygous Hb S or HBB: c.20A>T) presenting with initial signs and symptoms consistent with a vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC). Within 24 hours, the patient developed evidence of coagulopathy, multi organ failure and a reduced level of consciousness (LOC) prompting intubation. A diagnosis of FES was made on the basis of the patient's clinical presentation, in conjunction with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealing innumerable tiny foci of restricted diffusion, intracytoplasmic microvesicular fat on Sudan Red staining of bronchoalveolar lavage samples and evidence of a pulmonary shunt on echocardiogram bubble study. Red blood cell (RBC) exchange transfusion was initiated 3 days following initial presentation and no further exchange transfusions were needed on the basis of subsequent Hb S (HBB: c.20A>T) levels. The LOC gradually improved and the patient was extubated 12 days following presentation. Neurological improvement was slow, with mild cognitive impairment initially evident at 3 months and no cognitive or neurological deficits remaining within 6 months of admission. This case highlights the importance of understanding the pathophysiology and clinical presentation of FES, as early exchange transfusion may improve survival in patients with sickle cell disease and FES.
36400536		Chronic Pain: Prevalence and Management.Chronic pain is a distinct complication that profoundly affects the lives of individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD). Chronic SCD pain emerges with increasing age and is very prevalent in adults. The pathophysiology of chronic SCD pain is likely distinct from acute SCD pain and therefore needs a different treatment approach. Clinical trials evaluating the treatment of chronic SCD pain are lacking and treatment currently relies on evidence from other chronic pain conditions. Continued investigations into the underlying causes of chronic SCD pain are needed, and clinical trials focused on chronic pain therapy are imperative.
33827455		Haematological abnormalities in children with sickle cell disease and non-severe malaria infection in western Kenya.BACKGROUND: In Plasmodium falciparum infection, clinical conditions such as anaemia, thrombocytopenia and leukocytosis are common. Mutation in haemoglobin sub-unit beta gene (HBB) may be a genetic factor responsible for these haematological changes during infection. However, the contributions of the carriage of different HBB genotypes on these changes remain largely unknown. METHODOLOGY: In this cross-sectional study, we evaluated haematological abnormalities in P. falciparum-infected children (n = 217, aged 1-192 months) with different haemoglobin sub-unit beta (HBB) genotypes (HbAA, HbAS and HbSS). Children with acute febrile conditions were recruited at Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital at the outpatient clinic. Haematological parameters were determined using Beckman Coulter counter ACTdiff2  while HBB genotyping was done using TaqMan  SNP genotyping assay. Chi-square (chi2) was used to determine differences between proportions. Differences in haematological parameters were compared across groups using Kruskal Wallis test and between groups using Mann Whitney U test. Partial correlation test was used to determine correlation between haematological parameters and sickle cell genotypes while controlling for age and sex. RESULTS: Haemoglobin (Hb), [median (IQR); 7.3 (1.3), P = 0.001], haematocrit (HCT), [median (IQR); 26.4 (4.4), P = 0.009], red blood cells (RBC), [median (IQR); 3.2 (1.7), P = 0.048] were markedly reduced in HbSS, however, red cell distribution with (RDW) [median (IQR); 14.9 (3.3), P = 0.030] was increased in malaria infected children with HbSS. Severe anaemia was highest in HbSS (23.1%) followed by HbAA (8.6%) and HbAS (7.1%). There were no differences in platelet count (P = 0.399) hence no severe thrombocytopeania across the genotypes. Leukocytosis was highest in HbSS (69.2%), 42% in HbAS and 31% in HbAA. The RBC, HCT and Hb had negative correlation with RDW in HbSS in malarial-infected children (r = - 0.725, P = 0.008), (r = - 0.718, P = 0.009) and (r = - 0.792, P = 0.002), respectively. CONCLUSION: Our study reveals that anaemia is the most common abnormality in malaria-infected children with carriage of HbSS. The RBC, HCT and Hb concentration decrease with increase in RDW levels in infected children with carriage of HbSS compared to other HBB genotypes. Therefore, carriage of HbSS genotype is correlated with severity of haematological abnormalities.
34780794		Nonmydriatic Ultra-Widefield Fundus Photography in a Hematology Clinic Shows Utility for Screening of Sickle Cell Retinopathy.PURPOSE: To determine the feasibility and accuracy of nonmydriatic ultra-widefield (UWF) fundus photographs taken in a hematology clinic setting for screening of sickle cell retinopathy (SCR) DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. METHODS: This single-site study took place at the Johns Hopkins Sickle Cell Center for Adults and the Wilmer Eye Institute. The study population was 90 eyes of 46 consecutive adults with sickle cell disease (SCD). Bilateral nonmydriatic fundus photos taken by clinic personnel during the participants' routine hematology appointment were graded by 2 masked retina specialists at the Wilmer Eye Institute for the presence of nonproliferative SCR (NPSR) and proliferative sickle retinopathy (PSR). A third retina specialist adjudicated in cases of grader disagreement. All participants underwent the standard dilated fundus examination (DFE) within 2 years of acquisition of UWF photographs. The main outcome measure was the sensitivity and specificity of nonmydriatic UWF images for the detection of NPSR and PSR RESULTS: PSR was noted in 19 of 90 eyes that underwent DFE and in 9 of 67 gradable UWF images. Interrater agreement between the 2 graders was moderate, with kappa = 0.65 (range 0.43-0.87) for PSR. For gradable UWF photos, the sensitivity and specificity of detecting SCR using the nonmydriatic photos compared with the DFE were 85.2% and 62.5% for NPSR, respectively, and 69.2% and 100% for detection of PSR, respectively. One participant required ophthalmic therapy in both eyes for active sea-fan neovascularization. CONCLUSIONS: UWF imaging shows utility in screening for SCR and may help identify patients with PSR who require a DFE and who may benefit from treatment.
34105875		An investigation of sickle cell trait, body mass index, and fitness in relation to venous thromboembolism among African American adults.BACKGROUND: The relationships of sickle cell trait (SCT), body mass index (BMI), and physical fitness to venous thromboembolism (VTE) in young adults have received little attention. OBJECTIVES: To test for associations among SCT, BMI, fitness, and VTE. PATIENTS/METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 48,316 SCT-tested, African American individuals in the US Army during 2011-14. We used Cox proportional hazards models to compute adjusted hazards of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) associated with selected factors. RESULTS: Incidence rates of DVT and PE were 1.09 and 0.91 cases per 1000 person-years, respectively. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) for DVT for men and women with SCT were 0.9 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.4-2.0; P = .711) and 1.51 (CI: 0.7-3.2; P = .274), respectively. aHRs for PE for SCT+ men and women were 1.1 (CI: 0.5-2.4; P = .773) and 1.2 (CI: 0.5-3.1; P = .650), respectively. Low physical fitness was associated with DVT and PE in women (DVT aHR =3.1; CI: 1.4-6.5; P = .004; PE aHR =4.6; CI: 2.1-9.9; P < .001) and DVT in men (aHR =2.2; CI: 1.0-4.6; P = .048). Recent weight gain of 1 or more BMI points was associated with DVT in men (aHR =1.8; CI: 1.1-2.8; P = .017). CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence of increased VTE risk associated with SCT in this population. However, lower fitness levels and BMI increases were so associated.

However, the effects of HSCT on SCD pathophysiology are poorly elucidated. Here, we assessed red blood cell (RBC) adhesiveness, intensity of hemolysis, vascular tone markers and systemic inflammation, in SCD patients treated with allogeneic HSCT. Thirty-two SCD patients were evaluated before and on long-term follow-up after HSCT. Overall survival was 94% with no severe (grade III-IV) graft-vs-host disease and a 22% rejection rate (graft failure). Hematological parameters, reticulocyte counts, and levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), endothelin-1 and VCAM-1 normalized in SCD patients post-HSCT. Expression of adhesion molecules on reticulocytes and RBC was lower in patients with sustained engraftment. Levels of IL-18, IL-15 and LDH were higher in patients that developed graft failure. Increased levels of plasma pro-inflammatory cytokines, mainly TNF-alpha, were found in SCD patients long-term after transplantation. SCD patients with sustained engraftment after allo-HSCT showed decreased reticulocyte counts and adhesiveness, diminished hemolysis, and lower levels of vascular tonus markers. Nevertheless, systemic inflammation persists for at least five years after transplantation, indicating that allo-HSCT does not equally affect all aspects of SCD pathophysiology.
36210501		An Overview of Solid Organ Transplantation in Patients With Sickle Cell Disease.Sickle cell disease is a common genetic disorder affecting >300 000 people across the world. The vast majority of patients cared for in high-resource settings live well into adulthood, but many develop a high burden of disease complications. Good standard of care including disease-modifying agents and transfusion programs limits the number of patients who develop end-stage organ disease, but for those that do, the prognosis can be very poor. Solid organ transplantation is a well-established mode of treatment for patients with sickle cell disease and kidney or liver failure, but appropriate patient selection and perioperative management are important for achieving good outcomes. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and gene therapy may offer novel treatment options for adult patients with chronic organ damage in the future, but these are not yet widely available. For now, good, holistic care and early intervention of end-organ complications can minimize the number of patients requiring solid organ transplantation later in life.
37573345		Impact and burden of sickle cell disease in critically ill obstetric patients in a high dependency unit in Sierra Leone-a registry based evaluation.INTRODUCTION: Sickle cell disease (SCD) in pregnancy is associated with worse maternal and neonatal outcomes. There is limited available data describing the burden and outcomes of critically ill obstetric patients affected by SCD in low-income settings. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to define SCD burden and impact on mortality in critically-ill obstetric patients admitted to an urban referral hospital in Sierra Leone. We hypothesized that SCD burden is high and independently associated with increased mortality. METHODS: We performed a registry-based cross-sectional study from March 2020 to December 2021 in the high-dependency unit (HDU) of Princess Christian Maternity Hospital PCMH, Freetown. Primary endpoints were the proportion of patients identified in the SCD group and HDU mortality. Secondary endpoints included frequency of maternal direct obstetric complications (MDOCs) and the maternal early obstetric warning score (MEOWS). RESULTS: Out of a total of 497 patients, 25 (5.5%) qualified to be included in the SCD group. MEOWS on admission was not different between patients with and without SCD and SCD patients had also less frequently reported MDOCs. Yet, crude HDU mortality in the SCD group was 36%, compared to 9.5% in the non SCD group (P < 0.01), with an independent association between SCD group exposure and mortality when accounting for severity on admission (hazard ratio 3.40; 95%CI 1.57-7.39; P = 0.002). Patients with SCD had a tendency to longer HDU length of stay. CONCLUSIONS: One out of twenty patients accessing a HDU in Sierra Leone fulfilled criteria for SCD. Despite comparable severity on admission, mortality in SCD patients was four times higher than patients without SCD. Optimization of intermediate and intensive care for this group of patients should be prioritized in low-resource settings with high maternal mortality.
36123234		Editing human hematopoietic stem cells: advances and challenges.Genome editing of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells is being developed for the treatment of several inherited disorders of the hematopoietic system. The adaptation of CRISPR-Cas9-based technologies to make precise changes to the genome, and developments in altering the specificity and efficiency, and improving the delivery of nucleases to target cells have led to several breakthroughs. Many clinical trials are ongoing, and several pre-clinical models have been reported that would allow these genetic therapies to one day offer a potential cure to patients with diseases where limited options currently exist. However, there remain several challenges with respect to establishing safety, expanding accessibility and improving the manufacturing processes of these therapeutic products. This review focuses on some of the recent advances in the field of genome editing of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and illustrates the ongoing challenges.
38348531		Electrocardiographic abnormalities in patients with sickle cell disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis.BACKGROUND: Previous studies have documented that electrocardiography (ECG) can reveal a range of abnormalities, offering valuable insights into the cardiac evaluation of patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). The objective of this study is to assess the patterns of ECG abnormalities observed in these patients with SCD, and to determine their prevalence. METHOD: We systematically reviewed the literature using online databases of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, and Google Scholar to identify original studies that reported findings of standard ECG assessments in patients with SCD. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model. Additional analyses including sensitivity analysis and subgroup analysis were also conducted. RESULTS: Analysis of data from 59 studies involving 897,920 individuals with SCD revealed that 75% of these patients had abnormal ECG findings (67%-81%), which were predominantly nonspecific ST-T changes, left ventricular hypertrophy, T-wave changes, prolonged corrected QT (QTc) interval, and ischemic changes. Besides, it was shown that these patients had significantly higher odds of having any ECG abnormalities (OR of 17.50, 4.68-65.49), right atrial enlargement (6.09, 1.48-25.09), left ventricular hypertrophy (3.45, 1.73-6.89), right ventricular hypertrophy (7.18, 2.28-22.57), biventricular hypertrophy (10.11, 1.99-51.38), prolonged QTc interval (5.54, 2.44-12.59), ST depression (3.34, 1.87-5.97), and T-wave changes (5.41, 1.43-20.56). Moreover, the mean of QTc interval was significantly higher among those with SCD (23.51 milliseconds, 16.08-30.94). CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis showed a higher prevalence of abnormal ECG findings among individuals with SCD. A significant proportion of these patients had various ECG abnormalities, suggesting a potential need for regular ECG assessments for patients with SCD.
38130071		Reevaluation of the medical necessity of washed red blood cell transfusion in chronically transfused adults.BACKGROUND: Washing red blood cell (RBC) units mitigates severe allergic transfusion reactions. However, washing reduces the time to expiration and the effective dose. Automated washing is time- and labor-intensive. A shortage of cell processor tubing sets prompted review of medical necessity for washed RBC for patients previously thought to require washing. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A single-center, retrospective study investigated discontinuing wash RBC protocols in chronically transfused adults. In select patients with prior requirements for washing, due to a history of allergic transfusion reactions, trials of unwashed transfusions were performed. Patient demographic, clinical, laboratory, and transfusion data were compiled. The per-unit washing cost was the sum of the tubing set, saline, and technical labor costs. RESULTS: Fifteen patients (median age 34 years interquartile range [IQR] 23-53 years, 46.7% female) were evaluated. These patients had been transfused with a median of 531 washed RBC units (IQR 244-1066) per patient over 12 years (IQR 5-18 years), most commonly for recurrent, non-severe allergic reactions. There were no transfusion reactions with unwashed RBCs aside from one patient with one episode of pruritus and another with recurrent pruritus, which was typical even with washed RBC. We decreased the mean number of washed RBC units per month by 72.9% (104   10 vs. 28.2   25.2; p < .0001) and saved US $100.25 per RBC unit. CONCLUSION: Washing of RBCs may be safely reconsidered in chronically transfused patients without a history of anaphylaxis. Washing should be implemented judiciously due to potential lack of necessity and logistical/operational challenges.
33753141		Morinda lucida Benth (Rubiaceae): A review of its ethnomedicine, phytochemistry and pharmacology.ETHNOMEDICINAL RELEVANCE: Natural products derived from plants have served the primary healthcare needs of millions of indigenous people for centuries, many of which have been documented and scientifically validated. Morinda lucida Benth (Rubiaceae), also referred to as brimstone tree, is an ethnomedicinal plant which has been widely used in traditional medicine for several decades, particularly in the African continent. Various parts of the plant, including stem bark, leaves and root, have been applied in traditional medicine for the management of various pathological conditions such as malaria, diabetes, hypertension, inflammation, typhoid fever, cancer, cognitive disorders, sickle cell disease, trypanosomiasis, onchocerciasis and various fevers. In this review, we critically evaluated the relationship between traditional uses, laboratory pharmacological activities and clinical studies on M. lucida so as to unveil opportunities for the development of relevant therapeutic agents against diseases that threaten mankind. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A search for relevant data on M. lucida was done using scientific databases (Google Scholar, Mendeley, ScienceDirect, PubMed, Asian Science Citation Database, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Scientific Journal Database, Chinese Science Citation Database, other web sources (such as The Plant List and PROTA), books and other literature sources. RESULTS: A hundred compounds have been isolated from M. lucida. Many of the reported secondary metabolites include alkaloids, tannins, anthraquinones, sterols, saponins, polyphenols, terpenoids, phenols and cardiac glycosides. The in vitro and in vivo experimental studies on various extracts, fractions and isolated compounds of M. lucida support the acclaimed pharmacological activities of the plant, such as antimalarial, antidiabetic, hypotensive, anti-inflammatory, immunostimulatory, antioxidant, antimicrobial, antiproliferative, cognitive-enhancement, anti-sickling, anti-trypanosomal, anti-onchocercal, muscle relaxant, antifungal and anti-leishmanial activities. These evidence-based scientific reports lend credence to their traditional uses. However, the safety of extracts of M. lucida is a cause for concern following reported toxicities such as antispermatogenic effect, genotoxicity and in vitro inhibition of human cytochrome P450 3A subfamily. CONCLUSION: Documented evidence suggests that M. lucida remains a rich source of extracts and chemical compounds with diverse bioactivities that are of therapeutic benefit to man and this justifies its traditional uses for the primary healthcare needs of indigenous populations across tropical Africa. Due to the fact that M. lucida extracts may not be safe at some reported doses, more in-depth studies on their toxicities are required to better understand safer approaches to their traditional uses. In addition, mechanistic studies on the isolated compounds with known pharmacological activities are quite limited, thus necessitating future research efforts to be focused on the mechanisms of action of these active principles in order to facilitate their potential enlistment for rational drug design.
35841199		Sickle cell trait results in a high leukoreduction quality control failure rate for whole blood donations.BACKGROUND: Prior studies have shown that sickle cell trait (SCT) is the most common reason attributed to leukoreduction (LR) filter failure due to physical blockage. However, current Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines do not require blood collectors to take a specific action to mitigate inadequate LR that may occur among donors with SCT. We sought to determine the scope of inadequate LR among whole blood (WB) donations collected from individuals with SCT and processed under standard manufacturing conditions. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Between 8/2021 and 2/2022, a total of 40 red blood cells units (RBCs) manufactured from WB donations collected from donors historically positive for SCT had residual leukocyte testing performed. All 40 of the units had appeared to successfully complete leukofiltration. RESULTS: Out of the 40 units tested, 22 failed routine residual leukocyte quality control testing (55% failure rate, 95% confidence interval 40%-70%). Nine out of the 22 failures resulted in more than 100 residual leukocytes per microliter of product. CONCLUSION: Even when leukofiltration appears to have been completed successfully, WB units collected from donors with SCT have a high (55% in aggregate) rate of inadequate leukoreduction. Correlating this result with previous studies showing that of up to 50% of WB units collected from donors with SCT fail to pass through the leukoreduction filter, we estimate that only 25% of WB donations collected from individuals with SCT will result in a leukoreduced RBC unit that meets all FDA requirements. Blood centers should encourage individuals with SCT to donate platelets or plasma, rather than WB.

38204310		Newborn screening for sickle cell anemia in Antalya, Turkiye.BACKGROUND: In a screening study conducted on adults, the prevalence of sickle cell traits in Antalya was found to be 0.24%. Since no screening studies have been conducted in the neonatal period in our region, the exact incidence has not been determined. In this study, we aim to report our experience of neonatal screening for sickle cell disease in Antalya, Turkiye. METHODS: During a 14-month period, 2562 heel prick blood samples, taken on filter paper from Akdeniz University Hospital, Antalya Education and Research Hospital and Antalya Ataturk State Hospital and four other healthcare centers, were studied using the high pressure liquid chromatography method. Blood samples were studied using the `Sickle Cell Short Program` test method on a Bio Rad Variant device. RESULTS: In the study, no patients with sickle cell disease were identified. Four newborns who were sickle cell carriers (0.15%) and two newborns who were Hemoglobin D carriers (0.08 %), were found. CONCLUSION: Considering the efficiency and cost calculations made as a result of the data obtained from our study, it was concluded that sickle cell screening would not be effective in newborns. It seems more effective and economical to screen the children of parents, who are found to be at risk for Hemoglobin S carriage as a result of premarital tests.

Although blood transfusion is the gold standard for stroke prevention in SCD, the biological mechanisms underpinning its improved efficacy compared to hydroxycarbamide are not fully understood. We hypothesized that the improved clinical efficacy of blood transfusion might relate to differences in endothelial cell activation and VWF-ADAMTS13 axis dysfunction. One-hundred-eighty children with a confirmed diagnosis of SCD (HbSS) on hydroxycarbamide (n=96) or blood transfusion (n=84) were included. Despite disease-modifying treatment, plasma VWF and VWF propeptide were elevated in a significant proportion of SCD children (33% and 47% respectively). Crucially, all VWF parameters were significantly higher in the hydroxycarbamide compared to the blood transfusion cohort (p<0.05). Additionally, increased levels of other Weibel-Palade-body-stored proteins, including factor VIII (FVIII), angiopoietin-2, and osteoprotegerin were observed, indicated ongoing endothelial cell activation. Children treated with hydroxycarbamide also had higher FVIII activity and enhanced thrombin generation compared to the blood transfusion cohort (p<0.001), contributing to their thrombotic risk. Finally, hemolysis markers strongly correlated with VWF levels (p<0.001) and significantly reduced in the blood transfusion cohort (p<0.001). Cumulatively, our findings demonstrate for the first time that despite treatment, ongoing dysfunction of the VWF-ADAMTS13 axis is present in a significant sub-group of pediatric SCD patients, especially those treated with hydroxycarbamide. Since VWF plays an important role in vaso-occlusion pathogenesis, these data are of direct translational relevance.
34889358		Gene therapy for sickle cell disease: where we are now?The landscape of sickle cell disease (SCD) treatment continues to evolve rapidly, with new disease-modifying therapies in development and potentially curative options on the horizon. Until recently, allogeneic stem cell transplant has been the only proven cure for SCD. Gene therapy is rising to the forefront of the discussion as a potentially curative or highly disease- modifying option for abating the complications of the disease. Understanding the different types of gene therapy in use, the differences in their end points, and their potential risks and benefits will be key to optimizing the long-term use of this therapy.

Gene fusions involving two of these transcription factors have been well-characterized in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The TFE3-rearranged RCC (also known as Xp11 translocation RCC) was first officially recognized in the 2004 World Health Organization (WHO) renal tumor classification. The TFEB-rearranged RCC, which typically harbor a t(6;11)(p21;q12) translocation which results in a MALAT1-TFEB gene fusion, were first officially recognized in the 2016 WHO renal tumor classification. These two subtypes of translocation RCC have many similarities. Both disproportionately involve young patients, although adult translocation RCC overall outnumber pediatric cases. Both often have unusual and distinctive morphologies; the TFE3-rearranged RCCs frequently have clear cells with papillary architecture and abundant psammoma bodies, while the TFEB-rearranged RCCs frequently have a biphasic appearance with both small and large epithelioid cells and nodules of basement membrane material. However, the morphology of these two neoplasms can overlap, with one mimicking the other or other more common renal neoplasms. Both of these RCC underexpress epithelial immunohistochemical markers, such as cytokeratin and epithelial membrane antigen, relative to most other RCC. Unlike other RCC, both frequently express the cysteine protease cathepsin k and often express melanocytic markers like HMB45 and Melan A. Finally, TFE3 and TFEB have overlapping functional activity as these two transcription factors frequently heterodimerize and bind to the same targets. Therefore, these two neoplasms are now grouped together under the heading of "MiT family translocation RCC." Approximately 50 renal cell carcinomas with gene fusions involving the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene have now been reported. While those with a Vinculin-ALK fusion have distinctive features (predilection to affect children with sickle cell trait and to show solid architecture with striking cytoplasmic vacuolization), other ALK-fusion RCCs have more varied clinical presentations and pathologic features. This review summarizes our current knowledge of these recently described RCC.

However, the use of such donors may overcome the limited availability of HLA-matched donors for patients with beta-thalassemia major (TM) and sickle cell disease (SCD). We investigated hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) outcomes of pediatric TM and SCD patients treated with a mismatched donor using a treosulfan-based conditioning in combination with ATG and post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PT-CY) and compared these results to the clinical outcome of patients treated by matched donor HSCT without PT-CY. Thirty-eight children (n = 24 HLA-identical or 10/10-matched donors; n = 14 HLA-mismatched donors), who received a non-depleted bone marrow graft were included. Event-free survival (EFS) and GvHD were not higher in the mismatched PT-Cy group as compared to the matched group. Moreover, despite delayed neutrophil engraftment (day +22 vs. +26, p = 0.002) and immune recovery in the mismatched PT-Cy group, this did not result in more infectious complications. Therefore, we conclude that in the absence of an HLA-identical or a matched unrelated donor, HSCT with a mismatched unrelated or haploidentical donor in combination with ATG plus PT-CY can be considered a safe and effective treatment option for pediatric hemoglobinopathy patients.
37914454		"SCULP" study: The benefits of skin graft pellets on the pain of sickle cell leg ulcers (SCLU).BACKGROUND: Leg ulcers associated with major sickle cell disease (SCLU) are a chronic, painful complication, often treated by autologous skin graft. The analgesic effect of skin grafting in SCLU is poorly studied. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of skin grafting on the pain and healing of SCLU. METHODS: Patients hospitalized for SCLU skin grafting were included in a retrospective and prospective observational cohort, between 2019 and 2023: 53 autologous pinch grafts were performed on a total of 35 SCLUs in 25 sickle cell patients. The primary endpoint was the evaluation of the analgesic effect of the skin graft, measured by visual analog scale (VAS) and weekly cumulative analgesic consumption between day (D)0, D7 and D30. Wound healing was assessed by variation in wound areas between D0 and D30. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients with a median age range of 45.5years old were included, 68% were men, SS genotype was present in 96% of the cases. At D7, a significant decrease in VAS and consumption of analgesics of all classes was observed. At D30, only a significant decrease in VAS and consumption of mild opioids was present, as well as a significant reduction in wound surface area compared with D0. CONCLUSION: Pinch grafts have a significant early analgesic effect in the management of patients with SCLU, and significantly notice reduction of wound surface area within one month.

However, they are not free of side effects, with overloading the body with iron being one of the most important. Iron chelation therapy greatly reduces the iron load of the body. In addition, hydroxyurea (HU), an oral chemotherapeutic drug also has a significant role in the treatment of the disease with beneficial effects on many of the clinical problems that arise, mainly in reducing painful crises. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of synergistic transfusion therapy and HU on the response to deferasirox (DFX) chelation therapy. Eighteen patients with sickle cell disease were divided into two groups based on their treatment, either with simple transfusions and DFX or with a combination of transfusion therapy, DFX and HU, and were evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for liver iron concentration (LIC) and biochemistry. All patients completed the study. The results of the study showed improvement in serum ferritin (FER) levels and LIC after 12 months of therapy in both groups, especially in the group receiving the combination therapy with HU. In addition, there was a noteworthy improvement in serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels with serum creatinine (Cr) levels remaining stable during the study in both groups. Hydroxyurea, when combined with iron chelators such as DFX, provides an additional benefit of iron chelation in patients receiving chronic transfusion therapy.

He has highlighted the role of BCL11A in the fetal-adult hemoglobin switch. The Gairdner Foundation Award recognizes Orkin's contribution to the development of gene therapy of sickle cell disease.
35775883		Potential of point of care tests for newborn screening for sickle cell disease: Evaluation of HemotypeSC  and sickle SCAN  in Tanzania.BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an important cause of <5 mortality. In Tanzania, it is estimated up to 11 000 children are born with SCD annually, making this the fifth country with the highest SCD annual births worldwide. The biggest challenge of expanding the service of newborn screening for SCD as the national health intervention in Tanzania is due to the high cost of the currently used assays and lack of rapid screening methods. Therefore, in this study, we assessed the diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care tests for SCD diagnosis in newborns. AIM: To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of HemotypeSC  and sickle SCAN  in diagnosing SCD in newborns. METHODS: Diagnostic accuracy of HemotypeSC  and sickle SCAN  were evaluated in comparison to isoelectric focusing as a confirmatory method. RESULTS: A total of 706 newborns were enrolled in the study. The sensitivity and specificity of HemotypeSC in detecting Hb SS, Hb AS and Hb AA phonotypes was 100%. The sensitivity and specificity of sickle SCAN  in detecting Hb SS, Hb AS and Hb AA phenotypes were 100%, 97% and 100% respectively. CONCLUSION: Both POC tests displayed high accuracy in detecting SCD, we believe the introduction of either of these tests in health facilities will help in the early detection and management of SCD. In addition, the margin of cost per test is relatively affordable (1.4$ per test for HemotypeSC  and 4.75$ for sickle SCAN ).

The list of identified comorbid conditions includes hematological diseases, with sickle cell disease (SCD) falling into this category. CASE REPORT This case series examines the history, presentation, and clinical course of 5 patients with SCD who tested positive for SAR-COV-2 during the spring and summer of 2020. These patients experienced COVID-19 severities ranging from a mild cough and congestion to 8-day hospitalizations requiring blood transfusions. CONCLUSIONS While there is still a great amount of research on the interaction between COVID-19 and SCD needed, from this study we have concluded that patients with SCD do not always present with the classic COVID-19 triad of cough, shortness of breath, and fever. Often, these patients present with symptoms of vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC), including severe leg, flank, and chest pain, as was seen in 4 of 5 of our patients. We, and several other researchers, believe that this association between COVID-19 and VOC could be due to COVID-19 triggering inflammatory cytokines (notably IL-6) leading to system-wide inflammation, which induces sickling of the red blood cells. Based on this report, we recommend that SCD patients presenting with VOC who have had exposure to SAR-COV-2 be promptly tested for SAR-COV-2 to guide treatment and reduce mortality and morbidity in this vulnerable population.
34559236		Transfusion-Transmitted Malaria: Two Pediatric Cases From the United States and Their Relevance in an Increasingly Globalized World.In non-endemic settings, transfusion-transmitted malaria (TTM) is rare but potentially fatal and becoming more common with globalization. We present two pediatric cases that demonstrate donor screening using questionnaires is subject to error and that TTM should be considered with fever following numerous transfusions in children, particularly sickle cell patients.
34786695	treat|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell	A randomised controlled provider-blinded trial of community health workers in sickle cell anaemia: effects on haematologic variables and hydroxyurea adherence.Hydroxyurea (hydroxycarbamide) (HU) for sickle cell anaemia (SCA) is underutilised. Case management is an evidence-based health management strategy and in this regard patient navigators (PNs) may provide case management for SCA. We hypothesised that HU-eligible patients exposed to PNs would have improved indicators of starting HU and HU adherence. We randomised 224 HU-eligible SCA adults into the Start Healing in Patients with Hydroxyurea (SHIP-HU) Trial. All patients received care from trained physicians using standardised HU prescribing protocols. Patients in the Experimental arm received case management and education from PNs through multiple contacts. All other patients were regarded as the Control arm and received specialty care alone. Study physicians were blinded to the study arms and did not interact with PNs. At baseline, 6 and 12 months we assessed and compared laboratory parameters and HU adherence indicators. Experimental patients had higher 6-month mean fetal haemoglobin (HbF) levels than controls. But at 12 months, mean HbF was similar, as were white blood cell count, absolute neutrophil count, total haemoglobin, platelet count and mean corpuscular volume. At 12 months there were fewer experimental patients missing HU doses than controls (mean 1 8 vs. 4 5, P = 0 0098), and more recent HU prescriptions filled than for controls (mean 53 8 vs. 92 days, median 27 5 vs. 62 days, P = 0 0082). Mean HU doses were largely similar. We detected behavioural improvements in HU adherence but no haematological improvements by adding PNs to specialty care.
34656745		Biopsychosocial factors related to transition among adolescents and young adults with sickle cell disease: A systematic review.It is critical to support adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with sickle cell disease (SCD) during transition to adult healthcare. We provide a systematic review of literature related to biopsychosocial influences on transition among AYAs with SCD. Data sources included studies published between January 2010 and May 2020. Forty-four studies were included. Biopsychosocial factors related to improved transition outcomes included older AYA age, greater disease severity, intact neurocognitive functioning, and greater pain coping skills. Financial and insurance barriers were noted. The importance of cultural considerations and provider communication were noted across two qualitative studies. Ten studies assessed efficacy of transition interventions, with 80 % resulting in improvements; however, retention in programs was low and gaps in knowledge and skills remained. Incorporation of early, ongoing assessments of transition readiness and barriers into culturally-tailored interventions aimed at improving transition outcomes is recommended. Examination of longitudinal relationships and interactions across biopsychosocial influences is needed.
36965115		Acute chest syndrome in adult patients with sickle cell disease: The relationship with the time to onset after hospital admission.Data on acute chest syndrome (ACS) in adult sickle cell disease patients are scarce. In this study, we describe 105 consecutive ACS episodes in 81 adult patients during a 32-month period and compare the characteristics as a function of the time to onset after hospital admission for a vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC), that is early-onset episodes (time to onset <=24 h, 42%) versus secondary episodes (>24 h, 58%; median [interquartile range] time to onset: 2 [2-3] days). The median age was 27 [22-34] years, 89% of the patients had an S/S or S/beta0 -thalassaemia genotype; 81% of the patients had a history of ACS (median: 3 [2-5] per patient), only 61% were taking a disease-modifying treatment at the time of the ACS. Fever and chest pain were noted in respectively 54% and 73% of the episodes. Crackles (64%) and bronchial breathing (32%) were the main abnormal auscultatory findings. A positive microbiological test was found for 20% of episodes. Fifty percent of the episodes required a blood transfusion; ICU transfer and mortality rates were respectively 29% and 1%. Secondary and early-onset forms of ACS did not differ significantly. Disease-modifying treatments should be revaluated after each ACS episode because the recurrence rate is high.
34530179		Low Rates of Cerebral Infarction after Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation in Patients with Sickle Cell Disease at High Risk for Stroke.Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can be curative for sickle cell disease (SCD). SCD patients with cerebrovascular disease are often referred for HSCT. The objective of this study was to describe neurologic outcomes after HSCT in patients with pre-existing SCD and cerebrovascular comorbidity. Patients with SCD treated with HSCT at a single center between 1996 and 2019 were identified. Patients with cerebral ischemia and/or vasculopathy before undergoing HSCT were included. Patients with graft failure were excluded. The cohort was divided into 3 groups: symptomatic stroke, vasculopathy without symptomatic stroke, and isolated silent cerebral infarction (SCI). Magnetic resonance imaging/angiography and neurologic assessments pre- and post-HSCT were analyzed to assess outcomes. In a cohort of 44 patients, there were 25 with symptomatic infarction, 10 with vasculopathy, and 9 with isolated SCI. Post-HSCT ischemic injury (2 symptomatic strokes, 2 SCIs) was identified in 4 patients, all with previous symptomatic infarction. Within this group (n = 25), the post-HSCT incidence of subsequent symptomatic infarction was 1.6 events/100 patient-years, and SCIs occurred at a rate of 2.2 events/100 patient-years. No patient had progression of vasculopathy post-HSCT. Our data show a low incidence of new ischemic injury after successful HSCT for SCD. Patients with a history of both symptomatic stroke and vasculopathy are at greatest risk for post-HSCT ischemic injury.
34860784		Anemia in Pregnancy: Screening and Clinical Management Strategies.ABSTRACT: Screening recommendations for anemia during pregnancy, etiologies of inherited and noninherited forms of anemia, their impact on maternal-fetal outcomes, and the clinical management of pregnant patients presenting with these conditions are reviewed. Anemia during pregnancy can cause adverse perinatal outcomes including preterm labor, premature rupture of membranes, and increased maternal and fetal mortality. Physiologic (dilutional) anemia and iron deficiency anemia are the two most common noninherited forms of anemia, and some cases may be the result of an underlying comorbidity such as diabetes or lupus. Aplastic anemia and autoimmune hemolytic anemia are uncommon forms of noninherited anemias that also merit discussion. Inherited forms of anemia include sickle cell disease, alpha-thalassemia, and beta-thalassemia. Timely diagnosis and treatment of anemia during pregnancy, whether inherited or noninherited, is imperative to protect mother and baby from potential adverse outcomes associated with these conditions.
34271599		The effect of sickle cell anemia on the linear growth of Nigerian children.OBJECTIVES: Despite the high prevalence of children with sickle cell anaemia (SCA) in West Africa, there is paucity of data on the height velocity and prevalence of growth failure in SCA patients. With advances in clinical care of SCA patients, could there be a spatial and secular trend in the growth pattern of these children? Hence, the compelling needs to embark on this study. The objectives of the study were to determine the prevalence of growth failure among patients with SCA and its correlation with age, gender and age at diagnosis. METHODS: A Prospective longitudinal study of a cohort of sickle cell anaemic paediatric patients from Pediatrics SCA Clinic, University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, Ituku Ozalla. Patients were enrolled over a period of two years using a non-parametric convenient sampling method. Their heights were measured at baseline, three months, six months and at 12 months intervals and subsequently plotted on a standard WHO growth chart. The height velocities at different monthly intervals were calculated and compared with the WHO standard normal linear growth rates) for children (used as control) to identify those with GF. (i.e. <10th percentile). The main outcome measures were the mean height velocities at different months' intervals calculated and compared using the repeated measurement analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the Wilcoxon signed test. RESULTS: A cohort of 316 children aged 1-18 years with SCA was evaluated with a male preponderance of 161 (57.4%). The mean age and age at diagnosis were 11.04 +- 5.56 and 4.2 +- 1.7 years, respectively. The prevalence of growth failure and short stature was 84.7%. The burden of GF was highest among post-pubertal participants (94.1%). The most important predictor of growth velocity deficit was age (R2=0.045, standard beta coefficient = -0.22, t=-03.51, p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated high prevalence of growth failure in children and adolescents with SCA which intensified with advancement in age and older age at diagnosis.
35612367		Emergency department visits and hospitalizations among patients with sickle cell disease in illinois, 2016-2020.Sickle cell disease (SCD) state level surveillance data are limited. We performed a retrospective review of emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations from individuals with SCD in Illinois (2016-2020) using the Illinois Health and Hospital Association's Comparative Health Care and Hospital Data Reporting Services. There were 48,094 outpatient ED visits and 31,686 hospitalizations. Most visits (67%) occurred in Cook County, were covered by public insurance (77%) and were from individuals with medium high (40.3%) or high (36.1%) poverty levels. SCD healthcare utilization remains high and surveillance data may inform SCD program development and resource allocation at the state level.AbbreviationsCDCCenters for Disease Control and PreventionEDEmergency DepartmentFDAFood & Drug AdministrationICDInternational Classification of DiseasesILIllinoisSCDSickle cell disease.
36053868		Algorithm-based selection of automated red blood cell exchange procedure goals reduces blood utilization in chronically transfused adults with sickle cell disease.BACKGROUND: Automated red cell exchange (RCE) is a common treatment for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Two key parameters are used to determine the volume of blood for RCE to reduce sickle hemoglobin (eg, HbS): fraction of cells remaining (FCR) and target hematocrit. We evaluated how the calculated FCR-using the manufacturer's algorithm-impacted blood utilization and incidence of acute care encounters. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Retrospective chart review was conducted of 15 adults with SCD who underwent chronic RCE from July 1, 2015 to August 31, 2019. Blood utilization and acute care encounters were compared across three time periods: (a) when a fixed FCR of 30% was used (12 months); (b) transition period during which physicians made ad hoc changes to the FCR (25 months); (c) algorithm phase when a procedural FCR between 30% and 50% was selected using an algorithm generated by the manufacturer's built-in software to target a HbS fraction of 8% post-procedure (12 months). Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to determine statistical significance. RESULTS: Median blood utilization per procedure decreased from 2398 mL (interquartile range [IQR]: 2271-2759 mL) during the fixed FCR phase to 1887 mL (IQR: 1495-2241 mL) during the algorithm phase (P < 0.001). Similarly, median number of units transfused decreased from 10 (9-11) to 7 (5-9) during the respective phases (P < 0.001). Visits to the emergency department were 1 (0-4) in the fixed FCR phase and 0 (0-3) in the algorithm phase. CONCLUSION: Algorithm-based selection of a procedural FCR significantly reduced blood utilization (~21%) without appearing to increase acute care encounters.
35584830	treat|@CHEMICAL_Steroids|@DISEASE_Hemolysis ;treat|@CHEMICAL_Steroids|@DISEASE_Anemia_Hemolytic_Autoimmune ;treat|@CHEMICAL_Steroids|@DISEASE_Anemia_Hemolytic	How to approach haemolysis: Haemolytic anaemia for the general physician.Haemolytic anaemia can seem like a complicated topic. The constellation of reticulocytosis, increased lactate dehydrogenase levels, increased unconjugated bilirubin levels and decreased haptoglobin levels should prompt general physicians to consider haemolysis as a differential diagnosis. When further approaching haemolytic anaemia, subdividing patients into those who are 'direct antiglobulin test (DAT) positive' (immune) or 'DAT negative' (non-immune) is a simple and clinically relevant way to start to formulate a cause for the haemolytic anaemia. Immune causes of haemolytic anaemia include autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, drugs and delayed haemolytic transfusion reactions. Non-immune causes include the haemoglobinopathies (such as sickle cell disease) and microangiopathic haemolytic anaemias (such as disseminated intravascular coagulation). Early supportive care in haemolytic anaemia is important and may involve blood transfusions as well as interventions to slow the rate of haemolysis, such as steroids in autoimmune haemolytic anaemia. Complications of haemolysis include pigment gallstones, high-output cardiac failure and thromboembolism. Haemolytic anaemia should be referred to the haematologist for further investigation, however, the recognition and early management by the general physician is imperative in improving the patient's outcome.
34340260	treat|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell	Saving lives through early diagnosis: the promise and role of point of care testing for sickle cell disease.Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a devastating and under-recognised global child health issue affecting over 300,000 infants annually, with the highest prevalence in India and sub-Saharan Africa. Most affected infants born in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) lack access to SCD testing and die from complications in the first years of life without a formal diagnosis. The majority of deaths are preventable with early diagnosis and provision of inexpensive interventions. Despite global recognition of the urgent need, expansion of SCD newborn screening (NBS) programmes beyond the pilot stage has been obstructed by a dependence on an expensive and logistically challenging centralised laboratory testing model. Recently, several point-of-care tests (POCT) for SCD have been developed with promising field validation studies. Here, we summarise the state of POCT for SCD, review barriers and unanswered questions, and discuss optimal strategies for utilising POCT to address the growing global burden of SCD. There is an urgent need to prospectively evaluate the ability of POCT to reduce the morbidity and high early mortality of SCD. To impact a sustainable reduction to this end, it is essential to link a diagnosis with comprehensive SCD care, including wide and affordable access to affordable hydroxycarbamide therapy.
37777924		Erythrocytapheresis in a Patient of Sickle Cell Disease Presenting in Crisis.As per American Society of Apheresis (ASFA) guidelines, the indication for Erythrocytapheresis for sickle cell patients is category III for preoperative management and vaso-occlusive crisis. Erythrocytapheresis, with the help of automated cell separators, has the benefit of reducing the Sickle hemoglobin (HbS) levels to <30.0% with a reduced risk of increasing blood viscosity and single procedure achieving target hemoglobin levels. A 17-year-oldfemale patient who was a known case of sickle cell disease presented to our institution with a vascular necrosis of the right femoral head. Due to the pain and limitations of her day-to-day activities, she was advised for total hip arthroplasty. This patient underwent a successful Erythrocytapheresis using an automated cell separator and was operated on. In a sickle cell patient planned for surgical intervention, the procedure of Erythrocytapheresis can help in decreasing the chances of the patient developing any vaso-occlusive crisis during surgery and in the immediate post-operative period. This technique can help in improving the chances of a successful surgical procedure for such patients.

37783302		Prevalence of bone complications in young patients with sickle cell disease presenting low bone mineral density.PURPOSE: Bone fragility in sickle cell disease (SCD) has been previously reported even in young patients, but the clinical consequences and specific management remain unclear. The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of bone fragility in sickle cell patients and to evaluate the potential risk factors and associated complications. METHODS: We conducted a single-center cross-sectional study. Bone mineral densitometry (BMD) at the lumbar spine and the hip, Vertebral Fracture Assessment (VFA) and biological measurements were performed in patients aged between 20 and 40 years. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-eight patients with sickle cell disease were included between June 2020 and December 2021. One hundred and one patients (73.2 %) were from Sub-Saharan Africa, 13 from North Africa (9.4 %), 11 from the Caribbean (7.9 %), 6 from the Indian Ocean. A Z-score < -2 was found in 43 patients (31.2 %) at the lumbar spine, in 4 patients (3 %) at the total hip, and in 5 patients (3.7 %) at the femoral neck. 59 patients (46.8 %) had vertebral deformities. Fragility fractures were recorded in 9 patients (10.8 %). Patients with low BMD had lower BMI (21.3 (19.0, 24.0) versus 24.0 (20.7, 26.1) Kg/m2, p = 0.003), lower osteonecrosis history (7 % versus 25.3 %, p = 0.011) and lower hemoglobin levels (9.0 (8.0, 10.0) versus 10.0 (9.0, 11.0) g/dL, p < 0.01). No association was found between history of fracture and low BMD. CONCLUSION: Young patients with SCD commonly have low BMD at the lumbar spine, but the prevalence of fragility fracture was low. Low BMD - specifically at the spine - may not be tantamount to bone fragility.

35313324		Movement Is Life-Optimizing Patient Access to Total Joint Arthroplasty: Anemia and Sickle Cell Disease Disparities.Anemia and sickle cell anemia before surgery are often unrecognized medical comorbidities that can and should be addressed. Nearly 6% of the American population meets the criteria for anemia. The elderly, along with patients with renal disease, cancer, heart failure, or diabetes mellitus are more likely to be anemic. The most common form of anemia is due to iron deficiency, which can be easily treated before surgery. Sickle cell anemia occurs in 1 in 365 Black births and 1 in 16,300 Hispanic births, with 100,000 Americans currently living with sickle cell anemia. Patients who have anemia or sickle cell anemia are at increased risk for postoperative complications, including the need for blood transfusions and delayed healing. For those with sickle cell disease, surgeries can precipitate a sickle cell crisis. Patients with sickle cell anemia face barriers in accessing appropriate care; however, these patients can be optimized using preoperative red blood cell transfusions to dilute sickle cells and elevate the hemoglobin level. There should also be careful consideration and monitoring of the pain level of patients with sickle cell anemia in the perioperative period.
34215139		Analysis of hippocampal subfields in sickle cell disease using ultrahigh field MRI.Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited hemoglobinopathy that causes organ dysfunction, including cerebral vasculopathy and neurological complications. Hippocampal segmentation with newer and advanced 7 Tesla (7T) MRI protocols has revealed atrophy in specific subregions in other neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases, however, there is limited evidence of hippocampal involvement in SCD. Thus, we explored whether SCD may be also associated with abnormalities in hippocampal subregions. We conducted 7T MRI imaging in individuals with SCD, including the HbSS, HbSC and HbS/beta thalassemia genotypes (n = 53), and healthy race and age-matched controls (n = 47), using a customized head coil. Both T1- and T2-weighted images were used for automatic segmentation of the hippocampal subfields. Individuals with SCD had, on average, significantly smaller volume of the region including the Dentate Gyrus and Cornu Ammonis (CA) 2 and 3 as compared to the control group. Other hippocampal subregions also showed a trend towards smaller volumes in the SCD group. These findings support and extend previous reports of reduced volume in the temporal lobe in SCD patients. Further studies are necessary to investigate the mechanisms that lead to structural changes in the hippocampus subfields and their relationship with cognitive performance in SCD patients.

This study investigates GLOBE-based lentiviral vectors (LVs) for b<sup>AS3</sup>-globin addition and evaluates strategies for an increased b-like globin expression without vector dose escalation. First, we report the development of a GLOBE-derived LV, GLV2-bAS3, which, compared to its parental vector, adds anti-sickling action and a transcription-enhancing 848-bp transcription terminator element, retains high vector titers and allows for superior b-like globin expression in primary patient-derived hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Second, prompted by our previous correction of <i>HBB<sup>IVSI-110(G>A)</sup></i> thalassemia based on RNApol(III)-driven shRNAs in mono- and combination therapy, we analyzed a series of novel LVs for the RNApol(II)-driven constitutive or late-erythroid expression of <i>HBB<sup>IVSI-110(G>A)</sup></i>-specific miRNA30-embedded shRNAs (shRNAmiR). This included bifunctional LVs, allowing for concurrent b<sup>AS3</sup>-globin expression. LVs were initially compared for their ability to achieve high b-like globin expression in <i>HBB<sup>IVSI-110(G>A)</sup></i>-transgenic cells, before the evaluation of shortlisted candidate LVs in <i>HBB<sup>IVSI-110(G>A)</sup></i>-homozygous HSPCs. The latter revealed that b-globin promoter-driven designs for monotherapy with <i>HBB<sup>IVSI-110(G>A)</sup></i>-specific shRNAmiRs only marginally increased b-globin levels compared to untransduced cells, whereas bifunctional LVs combining miR30-shRNA with b<sup>AS3</sup>-globin expression showed disease correction similar to that achieved by the parental GLV2-bAS3 vector. Our results establish the feasibility of high titers for LVs containing the full <i>HBB</i> transcription terminator, emphasize the importance of the <i>HBB</i> terminator for the high-level expression of <i>HBB</i>-like transgenes, qualify the therapeutic utility of late-erythroid <i>HBB<sup>IVSI-110(G>A)</sup></i>-specific miR30-shRNA expression and highlight the exceptional potential of GLV2-bAS3 for the treatment of severe b-hemoglobinopathies.
37183964		Newborn screening for sickle cell disease in Kisangani, Democratic Republic of the Congo: an update.BACKGROUND: Neonatal screening is the first action necessary to identify children with sickle cell disease (SCD) and thus ensure their care. Using rapid tests to give an immediate result to families is a new resilient approach of great interest. These two aspects are essential for establishing an adequate health policy for this disease. This study was undertaken in Kisangani to update the current incidence of neonatal SCD. METHODS: Heel prick blood samples of 1432 babies born from different racial groups of parents living in Kisangani were collected at birth and screened using a point of care test, i.e. the HemoTypeSCTM. RESULTS: The incidence at birth was 2.2% (n = 31; 95% CI: [1.5%-3.1%]) for HbSS homozygosity and 21% (n = 303; 95% CI: [19%-23%]) for HbAS heterozygosity. Compared to a previous study in 2010; the incidence at the birth of the HbSS form has doubled, while that of the heterozygous form HbAS remained almost unchanged. The inter-ethnic incidence of HbSS among the five top-represented ethnic groups was significant (<0.001). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of homozygote form has doubled compared to the 0.96% reported in 2010. Setting up a neonatal screening program and an awareness unit is necessary to assess the need for care services correctly.
37646746		Evaluation of newborn screening in the state of Mato Grosso from 2005 to 2019.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate quality indicators of the Neonatal Screening Referral Service of the state of Mato Grosso (NSRS-MT) from 2005 to 2019. METHODS: Cross-sectional, retrospective, exploratory, descriptive, and observational study from 2005 to 2019. The following parameters were analyzed: age of newborns at the first collection, time between sample collection and arrival at the laboratory, time between the arrival and release of results and time between requesting the second sample and arrival at the NSRS. The population coverage of the program and the incidence of each clinical situation screened were also analyzed. RESULTS: NSRS-MT coverage was analyzed and recorded as 76%. The incidence was analyzed for congenital hypothyroidism (CH) 1:1867, phenylketonuria (PKU) 1:33,311, sickle cell disease (SCD) 1:2004, cystic fibrosis (CF) 1:12,663, congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) 1:15,843, and biotinidase deficiency (DB) 1:25,349. The median age (days) at the first consultation was: 44 for HC, 22 for PKU, 60 for DF, 52 for FC, 79 for HAC and 79 for DB. The mean time between exam collection and delivery to the NSRS was 8.4 days; between the arrival and release of results, 9 days; and for the return of recalls, 59 days. CONCLUSIONS: Regarding the coverage of the target population and collection at the ideal age, the NSRS-MT presents values below the national average. However, regarding the mean age at the time of the first consultation, the state's performance is better than the national.
37671823		Associating a standardized reporting tool for chest radiographs with clinical complications in pediatric acute chest syndrome.BACKGROUND: Acute chest syndrome (ACS) is an important cause of morbidity in sickle cell disease (SCD). A standardized tool for reporting chest radiographs in pediatric SCD patients did not previously exist. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the interobserver agreement among pediatric radiologists' interpretations for pediatric ACS chest radiographs utilizing a standardized reporting tool. We also explored the association of radiographic findings with ACS complications. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of pediatric ACS admissions from a single institution in 2019. ICD-10 codes identified 127 ACS admissions. Two radiologists independently interpreted the chest radiographs utilizing a standardized reporting tool, a third radiologist adjudicated discrepancies, and kappa analysis assessed interobserver agreement. Clinical outcomes were correlated with chest radiograph findings utilizing Pearsons' chi2 , t tests, and Mann-Whitney U tests. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. RESULTS: Interobserver agreement was moderate to near-perfect across variables, with kappa analysis showing near-perfect agreement for opacity reported in the right upper lobe (0.84), substantial agreement for right lower lobe (0.63), and vertebral bony changes (0.72), with moderate agreement for all other reported variables. On the initial chest radiograph, an opacity located in the left lower lobe (LLL) correlated with pediatric intensive care unit transfer (p = .03). Pleural effusion on the initial chest radiograph had a 3.98 OR (95% CI: 1.35-11.74) of requiring blood products and a 10.67 OR (95% CI: 3.62-31.39) for noninvasive ventilation. CONCLUSION: The standardized reporting tool showed moderate to near-perfect agreement between radiologists. LLL opacity, and pleural effusion were associated with increased risk of ACS complications.
35094624		Experiences of African Americans Living With Sickle Cell Disease.INTRODUCTION: About 100,000 individuals in the United States live with sickle cell disease (SCD). Palliative care (PC) can improve symptom management for these individuals. The purpose of the study was to explore (a) the experiences of people living with SCD, and (b) their knowledge and perceptions of PC. METHOD: Using a qualitative, descriptive design, adults with SCD were recruited from a foundation in the southeastern United States. Data included social and SCD-related demographics and audio-recorded, semi-structured focus groups. Analysis took a thematic analysis approach. RESULTS: Participants: There were 16 African Americans who participated in the study, 75% of whom were females, and aged 22 to 71 years. Five themes were identified: unique and unpredictable impact of SCD on daily life, the changing experience of SCD over time, stigmatization/marginalization in health care interactions, perceptions of support in managing SCD symptoms/crises, and PC: "What is it?" DISCUSSION: Participants lacked PC knowledge. PC should be offered to individuals with SCD as part of comprehensive SCD management.
36728286		A systematic review comparing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant to gene therapy in sickle cell disease.INTRODUCTION: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) and gene therapy (GT) are two potentially curative approaches for sickle cell disease (SCD), but they have never been compared in clinical trials. OBJECTIVE: To compare the safety and efficacy of HSCT and GT to assist clinicians and patients in making informed treatment decisions. METHODS: Phase I-III clinical trials and case reports/series were included. Regimens included HSCT from all stem cell sources, lentiviral gene therapy, and gene editing, with any conditioning regimen. We searched Medline and EMBASE databases as of 1st June 2020 for studies reporting HSCT and GT outcomes in SCD. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to assess the risk of bias. Descriptive statistics and post-hoc imputation for standard deviations of mean change in FEV1 and FVC were performed. RESULTS: In total, 56 studies (HSCT, n = 53; GT, n = 3) representing 1,198 patients met inclusion criteria (HSCT, n = 1,158; GT, n = 40). Length of follow-up was 3,881.5 and 58.7 patient-years for HSCT and GT, respectively. Overall quality of evidence was low, with no randomized controlled trials identified. Two-year overall survival for HSCT was 91%; mortality was 2.5% for GT. Acute chest syndrome and vaso-occlusive episodes were reduced post-HSCT and GT. Meta-analysis was not possible due to lack of comparator and heterogeneity in outcome measures reporting. Very few studies reported post-transplant end-organ function. Six secondary malignancies (5 post-HSCT, 1 post-GT) were reported. DISCUSSION: Reporting of SCD-related complications and patient-important outcomes is lacking for both strategies. We advocate for standardized reporting to better compare outcomes within and between treatment groups.
33866047		Qualitative and quantitative magnetic resonance imaging evaluation of bone tissue vaso-occlusive events in patients with sickle cell disease.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between bone changes due to vaso-occlusive events in sickle cell disease (SCD) revealed by conventional MRI sequences and the fat fraction obtained using a 6-point DIXON technique (FFdix), in an attempt to use quantitative data as a biomarker for bone complications. METHODS: Cross-sectional study, with 48 SCD patients, 26-homozygous (HbSS), and 22-compound heterozygous (HbSC). Forty-eight healthy individuals paired by age, weight, and sex with SCD patients. All participants underwent lumbar spine and pelvis MRI. Conventional sequences: bone complications related to vaso-occlusive events-femoral head avascular necrosis, bone infarctions, "H"-shaped vertebrae, bone marrow necrosis. Six-point DIXON technique: quantitative evaluation of the bone marrow at pre-established sites (lumbar vertebrae, sacrum, iliacs, femoral heads, greater femoral trochanters, femoral necks). Pearson's correlation, ROC curve, and binary logistic regression analysis were performed. RESULTS: The most frequent findings in the SCD group included femoral head avascular necrosis (75%), bone infarctions (58.3%), "H"-shaped vertebrae (58.3%), and typical imaging findings of bone marrow necrosis (8.3%). Cortical bone thickness in the proximal femoral diaphysis in patients with SCD was moderately negatively correlated with FFdix in lumbar vertebrae, iliacs, femoral necks, and first sacral vertebrae. The ROC curves and odds ratios demonstrated excellent performance of FFdix in all the evaluated anatomical sites and identified patients having bone complications. CONCLUSIONS: FFdix could serve as a potential biomarker in SCD because of its association with bone complications secondary to vaso-occlusive events in patients with SCD, especially in femoral heads, femoral necks, and iliacs.
35441384		The Recipient Epidemiology and Donor Evaluation Study-IV-Pediatric (REDS-IV-P): A research program striving to improve blood donor safety and optimize transfusion outcomes across the lifespan.BACKGROUND: The Recipient Epidemiology and Donor Evaluation Study-IV-Pediatric (REDS-IV-P) is a new iteration of prior National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) REDS programs that focus on improving transfusion recipient outcomes across the lifespan as well as the safety and availability of the blood supply. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The US program includes blood centers and hospitals (22 including 6 free-standing Children's hospitals) in four geographic regions. The Brazilian program has 5 participating hemocenters. A Center for Transfusion Laboratory Studies (CTLS) and a Data Coordinating Center (DCC) support synergistic studies and activities over the 7-year REDS-IV-P program. RESULTS: The US is building a centralized, vein-to-vein (V2V) database, linking information collected from blood donors, their donations, the resulting manufactured components, and data extracts from hospital electronic medical records of transfused and non-transfused patients. Simultaneously, the Brazilian program is building a donor, donation, and component database. The databases will serve as the backbone for retrospective and prospective observational studies in transfusion epidemiology, transfusion recipient outcomes, blood component quality, and emerging blood safety issues. Special focus will be on preterm infants, patients with sickle cell disease, thalassemia or cancer, and the effect of donor biologic variability and component manufacturing on recipient outcomes. A rapid response capability to emerging safety threats has resulted in timely studies related to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). CONCLUSIONS: The REDS-IV-P program endeavors to improve donor-recipient-linked research with a focus on children and special populations while also maintaining the flexibility to address emerging blood safety issues.
35021607		Effects of corticosteroids in patients with sickle cell disease and acute complications: a systematic review and meta-analysis.Whether corticosteroids improve outcome in patients with acute complications of sickle cell disease (SCD) is still debated. We performed a systematic review of the literature with the aim of estimating effects of corticosteroids on the clinical course of vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) or acute chest syndrome (ACS) in patients with SCD. The primary outcome was transfusion requirement during hospitalization. Studies were identified by search of MEDLINE and CENTRAL database. Three randomized clinical trials (RCT) and three retrospective cohort studies (RCS) were included, involving 3,304 participants and 5,562 VOC or ACS episodes. There was no difference between corticosteroids and standard treatment regarding transfusion requirement overall (odds ratio [OR]=0.98, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.38-2.53) but there was a significant interaction of the study type (P<0.0001): corticosteroid therapy was associated with a lower risk of transfusion in RCT (OR=0.13, 95% CI: 0.04-0.45) and a higher risk of transfusion in RCS (OR=2.12, 95% CI: 1.33-3.40. In RCT, the length of hospital stay was lower with corticosteroids as compared with standard treatment: mean difference - 24 hours (95% CI: -35 to -14). Corticosteroids were associated with an increased risk of hospital readmission as compared with standard treatment, in RCT, RCS, and the entire cohort: OR=5.91, 95% CI: 1.40-24.83; OR=3.28, 95% CI: 1.46-7.36 and OR=3.21, 95% CI: 1.97-5.24, respectively. Corticosteroids were associated with reduced number of transfusions and length of stay in RCT but not in RCS, with more rehospitalizations overall. Additional RCT should be conducted while minimizing the risk of rehospitalizations.
35233274		Timed Average Mean Maximum Velocity (TAMMV) of Cerebral Blood Flow of Children and Adolescents with Sickle cell Disease: correlation with clinical and hematological profiles in country.BACKGROUND: Detection of abnormal TAMMV with transcranial Doppler is fundamental in primary stroke prevention in children with sickle cell disease (SCD). The study aimed at evaluating TAMMV and correlating it with clinical and hematological profiles of children and adolescent with SCD. METHODS: Transcranial Doppler was performed on subjects aged 2-16 years, using a 2 MHz probe placed over the transtemporal windows. Pulse oximetry was used to determine the peripheral oxygen saturation while clinical and hematological profiles were retrieved from their medical records. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty five patients were recruited. The mean TAMMV was 125cm/s. Patients with HbSS had a significantly higher TAMMV (131cm/s) than those with HbSC (107cm/s). Only one (0.74%) patient had abnormal TAMMV. TAMMV correlated inversely with oxygen saturation, Hct and patient's age, and positively with white cell and platelet counts. Previous history of acute chest syndrome (ACS) and recurrent painful crises increased the risk of development of abnormal and conditional velocity. CONCLUSION: Frequency of abnormal TAMMV in this study was low. Younger children and those with HbSS had higher TAMMV. Age, oxygen saturation and haematocrit correlated negatively while white cell and platelet counts correlated positively with TAMMV. Previous history of ACS and recurrent bone pain were associated with increased risk of having abnormal and conditional TAMMV.
37093647	treat|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Death ;treat|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Genetic_Diseases_Inborn ;treat|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Malaria ;treat|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell	Simultaneous adjunctive treatment of malaria and its coevolved genetic disorder sickle cell anemia.Effective treatments for genetic disorders that co-evolved with pathogens require simultaneous betterment of both conditions. Hydroxyurea (HU) offers safe and efficacious treatment for sickle cell anaemia (SCA) by reducing clinical complications, transfusions, and death. Despite concerns that HU-treatment for SCA would increase infection risk by the human malaria Plasmodium falciparum, (the genetic driver of the sickle mutation), HU instead reduced clinical malaria. We utilized physiologically relevant drug exposures that mimic in vivo pharmacokinetics in humans. Under these conditions, we showed that HU and other ribonucleotide reductase (rnr) inhibitors, have significant, intrinsic killing activity in vitro against schizont stages of P. falciparum in both normal and sickle red blood cells. Long-term in vitro selection with HU increased expression of Pfrnr genes but showed low risk of eliciting stably resistant parasites or compromising potency of current antimalarial drugs. Additive activity devoid of antagonism by HU was observed with a wide spectrum of commonly used antimalarial treatments. These data endorse broad, safe, long-term use of HU for SCA in malaria endemic countries and provide a novel biological model for treatment of a genetic disorder with simultaneous, adjunct therapy of a life-threatening infection needed in a global health setting.
34486571		Associations Between Transcranial Doppler Flow Velocities, Laboratory Parameters, and Clinical Features in Turkish Children With Sickle Cell Disease.OBJECTIVE: Stroke is one of the major complications of sickle cell disease (SCD). Stroke features either occlusion of, or stenosis at, the origin of one of the large intracerebral arteries, the internal carotid artery (ICA), and/or the middle cerebral artery (MCA). PURPOSE: We sought correlations between cerebral blood flow velocities and the laboratory and clinical findings of patients with SCD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-three pediatric SCD patients (39 with HbSS, 14 with HbSbeta0) were analyzed. The mean patient age was 12.9+-3.9 years. The control group contained 24 healthy individuals. The time-averaged maximum mean velocity (TAMMV) and resistive index (RI) of the MCA, the TAMMVs of the ICA and vertebral artery (VA), and the diameter of the VA were estimated through transcranial Doppler ultrasonography using a 2.5 MHz transducer, in accordance with the Stroke Prevention Trial in Sickle Cell Anemia (STOP) protocol. We evaluated the relationships between the TAMMVs, laboratory parameters, and clinical findings. RESULTS: The mean+-SD MCA TAMMV was 161.2+-35.4 cm/s in patients with HbSS and 185.8+-62.9 cm/s in patients with HbSbeta0. The mean MCA TAMMV, RI, ICA TAMMV, VA TAMMV, and VA diameter were 168.5+-43.9 cm/s, 0.63+-0.06, 116.8+-25.5 cm/s, 69.2+-18.5 cm/s, and 3.5+-0.61 mm for all SCD patients, respectively. In the control group, the mean MCA TAMMV, RI, ICA TAMMV, VA TAMMV, and VA diameter were 103.8+-28.8 cm/s, 0.53+-0.04, 96.4+-27.8 cm/s, 40.3+-12.1 cm/s, and 3.4+-0.6 mm, respectively. Although the differences were not significant, TAMMVs were higher in HbSbeta0 patients taking hydroxyurea; those with hemoglobin levels <8 g/dL, ferritin levels >1000 ng/dL, mean platelet volume >12 fL, or red cell distribution width >18%; or required chelation, or were below the third percentiles of weight and height. The TAMMV was significantly higher only in SCD patients who complained of headache. CONCLUSIONS: High ferritin and low hemoglobin levels, a high mean platelet volume, a high red cell distribution width, low weight (below the third percentile), and a short height (below the third percentile) may be associated with elevated cerebral blood flow velocities and an increased stroke risk in children with SCD. Children with such features should be closely followed-up through transcranial Doppler ultrasonography examination.
36300706		National Audit of Criteria For Pre-Operative Sickle Cell Screening in Children.Aim We set out to identify the current practice in the anaesthesiology departments of Ireland's public hospitals that deliver paediatric anaesthesia with regard to pre-operative screening for sickle cell disease (SCD) and Sickle cell trait (SCT). Methods The Departments of Anaesthesiology at 14 public HSE-funded hospitals that deliver paediatric anaesthesia were contacted over a three month period in 2020. Any existing policies regarding pre-operative screening of paediatric patients for Sickle cell disease or trait were sought. Comparisons were made between any screening policies in place. Results A response was received from 11 of the 14 hospitals. Three out of 11 of the Anaesthesiology Departments have formal policies in place. The ethnicities identified for pre-operative screening varied across these three hospitals. Conclusion Despite a significant increase in the number of people of African, middle Eastern &amp; Indian descent living in Ireland in recent years, no neonatal screening programme for Sickle cell exists here, and no national policy exists with criteria to guide the practice of pre-operative screening of patients for SCD/SCT (trait). Our survey highlights a lack of standardisation in the approach to pre-operative sickle cell screening of children across Ireland's public hospital system. In view of the increasing multiculturalism in Ireland we recommend a national review of the merits of the introduction of developing a targeted national guideline for pre-operative screening for sickle cell in at-risk children.

34931522		The contribution of family physicians to chronic disease management through continuity of care in Ghana.Chronic non-communicable diseases contribute significantly to Ghana's disease burden. Ghana's ability to achieve universal health coverage is threatened by the rising burden of chronic non-communicable diseases. There is a high unmet need for cardiovascular diseases care, with primary health care for cardiovascular diseases not being readily available, equitable, or sensitive to the requirements of target populations. The contribution of family physicians in the management of the chronic disease burden through care continuity cannot be overemphasised. This is a short report of the implementation of a chronic care clinic by a family physician in Manna Mission Hospital, which is located in the Greater Accra region of Ghana. Before the implementation, there was no such clinic in the hospital and patients with chronic conditions who visited the facility were sometimes lost to follow-up. The clinic which commenced in January 2019 has provided care for patients with chronic non-communicable diseases to date. The most common chronic diseases managed at the clinic include hypertension and heart failure, diabetes, stroke, asthma, sickle cell disease, and joint disorders. This report gives an account of the contribution of family physicians to chronic disease burden management through continuity of care in a low-resource setting like Ghana.
37081816		Transition readiness in adolescents and young adults with chronic genetic skin conditions.BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Healthcare transition (HCT) refers to movement from pediatric to adult healthcare models. Lack of HCT preparation contributes to poor health outcomes. This study measures readiness to transition in individuals with genetic skin conditions. METHODS: Participants signed IRB-approved consents/assents. Participants ages 14-22 years with genetic skin disorders were surveyed with measures of QoL (Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index/CDLQI or DLQI) and HCT readiness using the Transition Readiness Assessment Questionnaire (TRAQ) and adapted non-validated measures of Skin Knowledge and Psychosocial Factors (5 = highest readiness). Mean TRAQ was compared with historical data on controls and other chronic conditions (t-tests) and correlated (Pearson) with Skin Knowledge and Psychosocial. Multivariable regression compared demographics and QoL with transition readiness. RESULTS: A total of 45 participants were enrolled (mean age 17.8 years, 67% female, 71% White; disorders of cornification [n = 31], ectodermal dysplasias [n = 7], epidermolysis bullosa [n = 4], tuberous sclerosis [n = 3]). Mean TRAQ (3.3 +- 0.9) was lower than controls (3.9; p < .001) and some chronic disorders (sickle cell [3.7; p < .05], type 1 diabetes [3.7; p < .01]), but higher than with spina bifida (2.8; p < .001) and congenital heart disease (2.9; p < .01). Mean Skin Knowledge was 4.2 +- 1.0, and mean Psychosocial was 3.4 +- 0.8. TRAQ correlated strongly with Skin Knowledge (r = .61; p < .05), but not Psychosocial (r = .12; p = .6). Ages 14-17 years versus 18-22 years and public versus private insurance predicted lower TRAQ scores. Poor DLQI predicted higher TRAQ and Skin Knowledge, but poor DLQI and CDLQI predicted lower Psychosocial. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents and young adults with genetic skin disorders demonstrated low transition readiness, especially among younger-aged and lower socioeconomic groups. We recommend a HCT intervention to improve health outcomes.
35803775		Left ventricular geometry and electrocardiographic criteria in assessing left ventricular hypertrophy in sickle cell anemia patients.BACKGROUND: Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is recognized as a cardiovascular risk factor and is a known consequence of sickle cell anemia (SCA). Abnormal left ventricular geometric patterns have been described but the determinants have not been well elucidated. METHOD: Electrocardiography (ECG) and Echocardiography (ECHO) was done on subjects with SCA and hemoglobin A(HBA). Those with systemic hypertension were excluded. Voltages, durations, and intervals were measured as appropriate and recorded in a standard proforma. Analysis was made using a standard statistical software. RESULTS: Eighty four people with SCA and 91 with HBA were recruited as cases and controls respectively. Subjects with SCA have more abnormal LV geometric patterns than those with HBA(p=0.000). Eccentric LVH(p=0.000) was more in SCA subjects while concentric LVH(p=0.054) and concentric remodeling(p=0.319) were not. Forty-one and fifty-two subjects with SCA and HBA respectively did ECGs. . Subjects with eccentric LVH had lower hip circumference, higher left atrial diameter, right atrial area, higher sokolow-lyon voltage sum, stroke volume and cardiac output. The Sokolow-Lyon voltage criteria at the traditional cut off point was not different between those with and without eccentric LVH. However, Sokolow-Lyon voltage criteria at a cut-off of >=4.7mV detected eccentric LVH with a sensitivity of 60% and specificity of 83.3%.While Sokolow-Lyon voltage sum, stroke volume, right atrial area, and left atrial diameter correlated positively, pulse rate and hip circumference correlated inversely with eccentric LVH. Sokolow Lyon voltage sum was the independent determinant of eccentric LVH in this study. CONCLUSION: Sickle cell anemia predisposes to abnormal LV geometric patterns, especially eccentric LVH. There may be a need to review the electrocardiographic cut off points for defining eccentric LVH in the SCA populace.
35093266		Process and strategies for patient engagement and outreach in the Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) community to promote clinical trial participation.INTRODUCTION: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common inherited blood disorder in the United States. The Cure Sickle Cell Initiative (CureSCi) was created by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) to improve the lives of people with SCD by accelerating the advancement of safe and promising genetic therapies, engaging the SCD community and healthcare providers, and encouraging collaboration among stakeholders. CureSCi is a collaborative, patient-focused research effort that includes patients at every level of the Initiative. Patient engagement is a key component, particularly during the development of clinical trials. OBJECTIVE: To describe the processes and strategies utilized by the CureSCi to engage individuals living with SCD about genetic therapy clinical trials. METHODS: The CureSCi Patient Engagement team conducted nine Community Outreach visits in 2019, each of which was structured to include separate group interviews with patients and medical providers. A set of guidance questions was developed for each audience and the interviews lasted approximately 60 minutes. RESULTS: Patients were asked about their participation in a clinical trial, and approximately 50% had participated in a trial. SCD individuals reported trusting their medical provider to provide them with information relevant to trials. Medical providers emphasized the individual, family, and health aspects of SCD that warrant additional investigation. Providers reported barriers encountered by patients as transportation, childcare support, infertility, and trust in the healthcare system. CONCLUSION: Lessons learned from the community have helped to influence recommendations for clinical trial design and key messaging development for the Cure Sickle Cell Initiative.
37255084		Thrombocytosis in children.OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the frequency and causes of thrombocytosis in patients admitted to the Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology of Elazig Fethi Sekin City Hospital, Elazig, Turkey. METHODS: Between 2019 and 2021, the laboratory parameters of 2,500 patients admitted to the Hematology Department were studied. During this examination, 319 (12.76%) patients were found to have thrombocytosis. Demographic characteristics (age and gender), hematologic parameters (hemoglobin, white blood cells, and platelets), and ultimate diagnoses ot the cases were recorded from their files. RESULTS: Of these 319 patients with thrombocytosis, 197 (1.8%) were male and 122 (38.2%) were female, and the mean age was 72.0+-69.0 (1-216) months. The median platelet count of the patients was 590.43+-280.12/muL (450,000-750,000). The most common cause of secondary thrombocytosis was infection, accounting for 37.9% of all patients. Other common causes were sickle cell anemia (21%), iron deficiency anemia (15.4%), colloid tissue disease (6.6%), hemolytic anemia (5.0%), splenectomy (4.5%), and other causes (9.7%). CONCLUSION: In our study, infections were the most common cause of thrombocytosis. In addition to infections, sickle cell anemia and iron deficiency anemia should also be considered in the differential diagnosis of thrombocytosis.
38324722		Incidence and Risk Factors of Pain Crisis After Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation for Sickle Cell Disease.Vaso-occlusive episodes (VOC) or pain crises are the commonest indications for hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for sickle cell disease (SCD). Elimination of pain crisis post-HCT is an important patient-centered outcome and may improve understanding of the natural history of pain syndromes in SCD. We examined de-identified records of 763 patients followed for a median of 36.7 months (0.3-168.6) with 69.6% patient's age at HCT <18 years, 83.3% patient's Karnofsky-Lansky Performance (KPS) score >= 90, overall survival 92.9%, event-free survival 72.4%, graft failure (GF) 22.4%, AGVHD 21.4%, CGVHD 27%, and pain crisis 8.65%. On unadjusted logistic regression, increased risk of pain crisis post-HCT was observed in patients with age at HCT >10 years (11-17 years [OR=9.43; 95% CI: 3.20, 27.79, p<0.0001], age >= 18 years [ OR=16.62; 95% CI: 5.85, 47.16, p<0.0001]), history of pain crisis 2 years before HCT [OR= 13.16, 95% CI: 4.08, 42.42, p<0.0001], alternate donors (haploidentical [OR= 4.80; 95% CI: 2.48, 9.31, p<0.0001], unrelated matched [OR= 2.71; 95% CI: 1.23, 5.97, p=0.0132], and mismatched unrelated [OR= 3.19; 95% CI: 1.44, 7.05, p=0.0041], and with GF [n= 41(5.37%), OR = 7.15; 95% CI: 4.20, 12.18., p<0.0001]. Pain crisis was less frequent with KPS >=90 [OR = 0.31; 95% CI: 0.18, 0.55, p<0.0001]. Multivariable logistic regression models confirmed age at HCT, KPS, graft type, donor type, history of VOC 2 yearspre-HCT, and GF as independent predictors of pain crisis post-HCT and generated predictive models and nomograms for pain crisis post-HCT for SCD which can support shared decision-making.
34898139		Biologic and Clinical Efficacy of LentiGlobin for Sickle Cell Disease.BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease is characterized by the painful recurrence of vaso-occlusive events. Gene therapy with the use of LentiGlobin for sickle cell disease (bb1111; lovotibeglogene autotemcel) consists of autologous transplantation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells transduced with the BB305 lentiviral vector encoding a modified beta-globin gene, which produces an antisickling hemoglobin, HbAT87Q. METHODS: In this ongoing phase 1-2 study, we optimized the treatment process in the initial 7 patients in Group A and 2 patients in Group B with sickle cell disease. Group C was established for the pivotal evaluation of LentiGlobin for sickle cell disease, and we adopted a more stringent inclusion criterion that required a minimum of four severe vaso-occlusive events in the 24 months before enrollment. In this unprespecified interim analysis, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of LentiGlobin in 35 patients enrolled in Group C. Included in this analysis was the number of severe vaso-occlusive events after LentiGlobin infusion among patients with at least four vaso-occlusive events in the 24 months before enrollment and with at least 6 months of follow-up. RESULTS: As of February 2021, cell collection had been initiated in 43 patients in Group C; 35 received a LentiGlobin infusion, with a median follow-up of 17.3 months (range, 3.7 to 37.6). Engraftment occurred in all 35 patients. The median total hemoglobin level increased from 8.5 g per deciliter at baseline to 11 g or more per deciliter from 6 months through 36 months after infusion. HbAT87Q contributed at least 40% of total hemoglobin and was distributed across a mean (+-SD) of 85+-8% of red cells. Hemolysis markers were reduced. Among the 25 patients who could be evaluated, all had resolution of severe vaso-occlusive events, as compared with a median of 3.5 events per year (range, 2.0 to 13.5) in the 24 months before enrollment. Three patients had a nonserious adverse event related or possibly related to LentiGlobin that resolved within 1 week after onset. No cases of hematologic cancer were observed during up to 37.6 months of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: One-time treatment with LentiGlobin resulted in sustained production of HbAT87Q in most red cells, leading to reduced hemolysis and complete resolution of severe vaso-occlusive events.

38360190		The influence of body mass index on airway resistance in children with sickle cell disease: A longitudinal study based on impulse oscillometry.BACKGROUND: Impulse oscillometry (IOS) is an effective tool for assessing airway mechanics and diagnosing obstructive airway disease (OAD) in children with sickle cell disease (C-SCD). Obesity is known to be associated with OAD, and untreated OAD often leads to hypoxia-related complications in C-SCD. Considering the increasing prevalence of obesity in C-SCD, it is important to explore the influence of body mass index (BMI) on OAD in this disease population. METHODS: A longitudinal retrospective chart review was conducted on 55 C-SCD (161 IOS observations) and 35 non-SCD asthmatic children (C-Asthma) (58 observations), primarily to investigate the association between BMI and airway resistance in C-SCD and C-Asthma. We conducted generalized linear mixed models (GLMM), adjusted for pharmacotherapies, to demonstrate the influence of BMI on total (R5), central (R20), and peripheral (R5-20) airway resistance and reactance (X5, resonant frequency (Fres)). We further compared age, BMI, and IOS indices between C-SCD and C-Asthma using the Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: Age and BMI were not statistically different between the two groups. In C-SCD, BMI was associated with R5 (GLMM t-statistics:3.75, 95%CI:1.01,3.27, p-value<0.001*) and R20 (t-statistics:4.01, 95%CI:1.04,1.15, p-value<0.001*), but not with R5-20 or airway reactance. In asthmatics, BMI was not associated with IOS estimates except Fres (t-statistics: 3.93, 95%CI: -0.06, -0.02, p-value<0.001*). C-SCD demonstrated higher airway resistances (R5 and R20) and reactance (Fres) compared to C-Asthma (Mann-Whitney: p-values<0.05). CONCLUSION: BMI significantly influenced total and central airway resistance in C-SCD. While higher airway resistances reflected increased OAD in C-SCD than asthmatics, higher Fres perhaps indicated progressive pulmonary involvement in C-SCD.
34673714		Pulmonary Blastomycosis: A Rare Cause of Acute Chest Syndrome and Prolonged Fevers in a Pediatric Patient With Sickle Cell Disease.Blastomyces is a fungus found in the soil of regions of North America including the Mississippi and Ohio River Valleys. It can be inhaled into the lungs and cause pneumonia and disseminated disease. Although blastomycosis is not widely reported in the sickle cell literature, sickle cell patients may be at increased risk of complications from blastomycosis pneumonia due to their immune compromise and risk of developing acute chest syndrome. We describe the case of a 13-year-old female with homozygous sickle cell disease who presented with pneumonia and acute chest syndrome and was found to have pulmonary blastomycosis.
34544432		Vaso-occlusive crisis in sickle cell disease: a vicious cycle of secondary events.Painful vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) remains the most common reason for presenting to the Emergency Department and hospitalization in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Although two new agents have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treating SCD, they both target to reduce the frequency of VOC. Results from studies investigating various approaches to treat and shorten VOC have so far been generally disappointing. In this paper, we will summarize the complex pathophysiology and downstream events of VOC and discuss the likely reasons for the disappointing results using monotherapy. We will put forward the rationale for exploring some of the currently available agents to either protect erythrocytes un-involved in the hemoglobin polymerization process from sickling induced by the secondary events, or a multipronged combination approach that targets the complex downstream pathways of VOC.
36996737		Non-pharmacological pain interventions for sickle cell crisis in pediatrics: A scoping review.PROBLEM: Sickle cell crises (SCC) are recurrent, severe pain episodes experienced by people living with sickle cell disease (SCD). Non-pharmacological interventions have been recommended for SCC pain management however, little is known about the impact of these interventions on SCC pain. This scoping review aims to systematically identify evidence on the use and effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions for pain management during SCC in the pediatric population. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Studies were eligible if they are published in English and focusing on the use of any non-pharmacological interventions on pain during SCC in pediatric patients. Nine databases were searched including Medline, CINAHL and PsychInfo. Also, the reference lists of relevant studies were searched. SAMPLE: The database searching yielded 1517 studies. After the title and abstract screening, 1348 studies were excluded, and 169 full texts were retrieved and screened. One study was identified through handsearching. Finally, 27 articles were included in this scoping review. RESULTS: Across all studies, 27 different non-pharmacological interventions were identified. There were inconsistent results regarding the effectiveness of virtual reality, guided imagery, and cognitive-behavioral interventions in experimental studies. The most common interventions used at home were prayer, massage, and distraction. The main interventions used in hospitals were prayer and fluid intake, but this was explored by a few studies. CONCLUSION: Pediatric SCD patients use numerous non-pharmacological interventions to manage pain during SCC. However, the impact of many interventions on SCC pain has not been empirically investigated. IMPLICATIONS: Further research is necessary to establish the effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions on SCC pain.

36001683		PARACENTRAL ACUTE MIDDLE MACULOPATHY IN A PATIENT WITH FREQUENT MIGRAINE WITH AURA: A CASE REPORT.BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: To explore the possible relationship between Paracentral Acute Middle Maculopathy (PAMM) and migraine. Paracentral acute middle maculopathy is a recently described clinical and optical coherence tomography entity involving infarction of the inner nuclear layer secondary to deep retinal capillary ischemia. It presents as a painless paracentral scotoma and often results in permanent visual deficits. Migraine, especially migraine with aura, has been shown to cause structural changes in the retinal microvasculature and to be a risk factor for retinal ischemia. METHODS: A case report and review of the literature. RESULTS: A 39-year-old woman with migraine with visual aura presented with a discrete, monocular, painless "buffalo-shaped" paracentral scotoma, which started during a period of frequent typical visual auras. Her exam and optical coherence tomography were consistent with PAMM. CONCLUSION: We propose that migraine is a risk factor for the development of PAMM. The changes in retinal microvasculature in migraine may increase a patient's susceptibility to retinal ischemia. Other risk factors for retinal ischemia, including diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, sickle cell disease, and orbital trauma, have been shown to be associated with PAMM. Further research should be conducted to determine whether there is a definite relationship between migraine and PAMM.
37675899		Gene therapy for Hemoglobinopathies.Beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease (SCD) are autosomal recessive disorders of red blood cells due to mutations in the adult ss-globin gene, with a worldwide diffusion. The severe forms of hemoglobinopathies are fatal if untreated, and allogeneic bone marrow transplantation can be offered to a limited proportion of patients. The unmet clinical need and the disease incidence have promoted the development of new genetic therapies based on the engineering of autologous hematopoietic stem cells. Here, the steps of ex vivo gene therapy development are reviewed along with results from clinical trials and recent new approaches employing cutting edge gene editing tools.
34325680		Incidence and predictors of hospital readmission in children presenting with severe anaemia in Uganda and Malawi: a secondary analysis of TRACT trial data.BACKGROUND: Severe anaemia (haemoglobin < 6 g/dL) is a leading cause of recurrent hospitalisation in African children. We investigated predictors of readmission in children hospitalised with severe anaemia in the TRACT trial (ISRCTN84086586) in order to identify potential future interventions. METHODS: Secondary analyses of the trial examined 3894 children from Uganda and Malawi surviving a hospital episode of severe anaemia. Predictors of all-cause readmission within 180 days of discharge were identified using multivariable regression with death as a competing risk. Groups of children with similar characteristics were identified using hierarchical clustering. RESULTS: Of the 3894 survivors 682 (18%) were readmitted; 403 (10%) had >=2 re-admissions over 180 days. Three main causes of readmission were identified: severe anaemia (n = 456), malaria (n = 252) and haemoglobinuria/dark urine syndrome (n = 165). Overall, factors increasing risk of readmission included HIV-infection (hazard ratio 2.48 (95% CI 1.63-3.78), p < 0.001); >=2 hospital admissions in the preceding 12 months (1.44(1.19-1.74), p < 0.001); history of transfusion (1.48(1.13-1.93), p = 0.005); and missing >=1 trial medication dose (proxy for care quality) (1.43 (1.21-1.69), p < 0.001). Children with uncomplicated severe anaemia (Hb 4-6 g/dL and no severity features), who never received a transfusion (per trial protocol) during the initial admission had a substantially lower risk of readmission (0.67(0.47-0.96), p = 0.04). Malaria (among children with no prior history of transfusion) (0.60(0.47-0.76), p < 0.001); younger-age (1.07 (1.03-1.10) per 1 year younger, p < 0.001) and known sickle cell disease (0.62(0.46-0.82), p = 0.001) also decreased risk of readmission. For anaemia re-admissions, gross splenomegaly and enlarged spleen increased risk by 1.73(1.23-2.44) and 1.46(1.18-1.82) respectively compared to no splenomegaly. Clustering identified four groups of children with readmission rates from 14 to 20%. The cluster with the highest readmission rate was characterised by very low haemoglobin (mean 3.6 g/dL). Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) predominated in two clusters associated with chronic repeated admissions or severe, acute presentations in largely undiagnosed SCD. The final cluster had high rates of malaria (78%), severity signs and very low platelet count, consistent with acute severe malaria. CONCLUSIONS: Younger age, HIV infection and history of previous hospital admissions predicted increased risk of readmission. However, no obvious clinical factors for intervention were identified. As missing medication doses was highly predictive, attention to care related factors may be important. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN ISRCTN84086586 .
35044697		Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is more prevalent in Duffy-null red blood cell transfusion in sickle cell disease.BACKGROUND: Resistance to malaria infection may be conferred by erythrocyte genetic variations including glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency and lack of Duffy antigens. In red blood cell (RBC) transfusion, G6PD deficiency may shorten transfusion survival. Because Duffy-null units are commonly transfused in sickle cell disease (SCD) due to antigen matching protocols, we examined whether Duffy-null donor RBC units have a higher prevalence of G6PD deficiency. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pediatric patients with SCD on chronic transfusion therapy were followed prospectively for multiple transfusions. RBC unit segments were collected to measure G6PD activity and RBC genotyping. The decline in donor hemoglobin (DeltaHbA) following transfusion was assessed from immediate posttransfusion estimates and HbA measurements approximately 1 month later. RESULTS: Of 564 evaluable RBC units, 59 (10.5%) were G6PD deficient (23 severe, 36 moderate deficiency); 202 (37.6%) units were Duffy-null. G6PD deficiency occurred in 40 (19.8%) Duffy-null units versus 15 (4.5%) Duffy-positive units (p < .0001). In univariate analysis, the fraction of Duffy-null RBC units per transfusion was associated with greater decline in HbA (p = .038); however, in multivariate analysis, severe G6PD deficiency (p = .0238) but not Duffy-null RBC (p = .0139) were associated with DeltaHbA. CONCLUSION: Selection of Duffy-null RBC units may result in shorter in vivo survival of transfused RBCs due to a higher likelihood of transfusing units from G6PD deficient donors.
36123668		Prevention and control of non-communicable diseases in antenatal, intrapartum, and postnatal care: a systematic scoping review of clinical practice guidelines since 2011.BACKGROUND: Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are a leading cause of maternal mortality and morbidity worldwide. The World Health Organization is developing new recommendations focusing on the management of NCDs for pregnant, intrapartum, and postnatal women. Thus, to support the development of new guidelines and recommendations, we aimed to determine the availability, focus, and scope of recommendations of current guidelines for the management of NCDs during pregnancy, intrapartum, and postnatal period. METHODS: PubMed, Global Index Medicus, TRIP, and Guideline International Network databases were searched on 31 May 2021, to identify any NCD-related guidelines published between 2011 and 2021 with no language or country restrictions. Websites of 165 professional organizations were also searched. Characteristics of included guidelines were analyzed, and recommendations were extracted from guidelines of five high-priority NCD conditions (diabetes, chronic hypertension, respiratory conditions, hemoglobinopathies and sickle cell disease, and mental and substance use disorders). RESULTS: From 6026 citations and 165 websites, 405 guidelines were included of which 132 (33%) were pregnancy-specific and 285 (88%) were developed in high-income countries. Among pregnancy-specific guidelines, the most common conditions for which recommendations were provided were gestational diabetes, circulatory diseases, thyroid disorders, and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. For the five high-priority conditions, 47 guidelines were identified which provided 1834 recommendations, largely focused on antenatal care interventions (62%) such as early detection, screening tools, pharmacological treatment, and lifestyle education. Postnatal recommendations largely covered postnatal clinical assessments, lifestyle education, and breastfeeding. Health system recommendations largely covered multidisciplinary care teams and strengthening referral pathways. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a robust assessment of currently available guidelines and mapping of recommendations on NCD management within maternal health services, which will inform the scope of the World Health Organization's future guideline development activities. This study identified a need to develop guidelines that consider NCDs holistically, with an integrated approach to antenatal, intrapartum, and postnatal care, and that are relevant for resource-limited contexts. Any such guidelines should consider what interventions are most essential to improving outcomes for women with NCDs and their newborns, and how variations in quality of NCD-related care can be addressed.

SCD is an autosomal recessive disease resulting from a single point mutation in codon six of the beta-globin gene (HBB). Ex vivo beta-globin gene correction in autologous patient-derived hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) may potentially provide a curative treatment for SCD. We previously developed a CRISPR-Cas9 gene targeting strategy that uses high-fidelity Cas9 precomplexed with chemically modified guide RNAs to induce recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 6 (rAAV6)-mediated HBB gene correction of the SCD-causing mutation in HSPCs. Here, we demonstrate the preclinical feasibility, efficacy, and toxicology of HBB gene correction in plerixafor-mobilized CD34+ cells from healthy and SCD patient donors (gcHBB-SCD). We achieved up to 60% HBB allelic correction in clinical-scale gcHBB-SCD manufacturing. After transplant into immunodeficient NSG mice, 20% gene correction was achieved with multilineage engraftment. The long-term safety, tumorigenicity, and toxicology study demonstrated no evidence of abnormal hematopoiesis, genotoxicity, or tumorigenicity from the engrafted gcHBB-SCD drug product. Together, these preclinical data support the safety, efficacy, and reproducibility of this gene correction strategy for initiation of a phase 1/2 clinical trial in patients with SCD.
33895405		Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Outcomes among Medicaid and Privately Insured Patients with Sickle Cell Disease.Compared with privately insured patients, recipients of Medicaid have been reported to have worse outcomes in several clinical conditions and following various surgical and medical procedures. However, the relationship between health insurance status and allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) outcomes among patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) is not well described. We sought to compare alloHCT outcomes between patients with SCD who underwent alloHCT while enrolled on Medicaid versus those who underwent alloHCT while covered by private health insurance. We conducted a retrospective multicenter study using data reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research. US patients enrolled on Medicaid or private insurance who underwent a first alloHCT for SCD between 2008 and 2018 were eligible for this study. The primary outcome was event-free survival (EFS), defined as time to death or graft failure. Secondary outcomes included overall survival (OS), graft failure, acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and chronic GVHD. Univariate analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method for EFS and OS. The proportion of patients with graft failure, acute GVHD, and/or chronic GVHD was calculated using the cumulative incidence estimator to accommodate competing risks (ie, death). Cox regression was used to identify factors associated with EFS, OS, graft failure, and acute and chronic GVHD. A total of 399 patients (Medicaid, n = 225; private insurance, n = 174) were included in this study. The median duration of follow-up was 34 months (range, 1.0 to 134.7 months) for the Medicaid group and 38.7 months (range, 0.3 to 139.3 months) for the private insurance group. Compared with the patients with private insurance, those on Medicaid had a significantly lower 3-year EFS (75.4% [95% confidence interval (CI), 69.4% to 81%] versus 82.2% [95% CI, 76.9% to 87.8%]; P = .0279) and a significantly higher 3-year cumulative incidence of graft failure (17.2% [95% CI, 12.5% to 22.5%] versus 10.5% [95% CI, 6.4% to 15.4%]; P = .0372). There were no significant between-group differences in 3-year OS (P = .6337) or in the cumulative incidence of acute GVHD (P = .4556) or chronic GVHD (P = .6878). Cox regression analysis after adjusting for other significant variables showed that the patients enrolled on Medicaid had a lower EFS (hazard ratio [HR], 2.36; 95% CI, 1.44 to 3.85; P = .0006) and a higher cumulative incidence of graft failure (HR, 2.57; 95% CI, 1.43 to 4.60; P = .0015), with no significant between-group differences in OS (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.47 to 2.07; P = .9765), acute GVHD (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.59 to 1.49; P = .7905), or cGVHD (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.65 to 1.48; P = .9331). That EFS is worse in patients on Medicaid compared with privately insured individuals following alloHCT for SCD provides the rationale for research to better understand the mechanisms by which insurance status impacts alloHCT outcomes among patients with SCD.

34823201	treat|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_COVID_19 ;treat|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell	Prognostic factors associated with COVID-19 related severity in sickle cell disease.BACKGROUND: Equipoise exists regarding sickle cell disease (SCD) as a risk factor for COVID-19 disease severity and variables that increase risk of COVID-19 severity in SCD. Given our health system's large SCD patient catchment, we analyzed our own experience in this regard. STUDY METHODS: Retrospective analysis of the clinical course and factors associated with need for hospitalization and ICU admission of SCD patients diagnosed with COVID-19 through the Northwell Health system from March 1 to Dec 31, 2020. RESULTS: Of 1098 patients with SCD, 3.3% were diagnosed with COVID-19. Overall rates of hospitalization, ICU admission, cohort mortality, and in-hospital mortality were 80%, 19%, 2.5%,and 3.1%, respectively. By multivariable analysis, hospitalization risk was decreased by 60% for every 1 g/dL increase in admission Hb. ICU admission risk was increased by 84% as a health care worker; increased by 45% for every 1000/uL increase in admission immature granulocyte count; and decreased by 17% with hydroxyurea use. DISCUSSION: High hospitalization rates are compatible with worsened severity upon COVID-19 infection in SCD compared to the general population. Patients should be placed on hydroxyurea to increase their Hb and perhaps lower their neutrophil counts. Health care workers with SCD may warrant special safety precautions.

Deferiprone (Ferriprox ) is an oral iron chelator indicated for the treatment of transfusional iron overload due to thalassemia syndromes and has been recently approved as a treatment for iron overload in adult and pediatric patients with SCD and other anemias. The present study aims to characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of deferiprone (DFP) in adult subjects with SCD. In this phase I, open-label study, subjects with SCD were administered a single 1500 mg dose of DFP. Blood and urine samples were collected for PK assessments of DFP and its main metabolite, deferiprone 3-O-glucuronide (DFP-G). Eight subjects were enrolled and completed the study. Following drug administration, serum levels of DFP and DFP-G rose to maximum concentrations at 1.0 and 2.8 h post-dose, respectively. The half-lives of DFP and DFP-G were 1.5 and 1.6 h, respectively. The majority of administered drug was metabolized and excreted as DFP-G, with less than 4% excreted unchanged in urine up to 10 h post-dose. Subjects received a safety assessment 7 (+- 3) days post-dose. Two subjects reported mild adverse events unrelated to the study drug, and no other safety concerns were reported. The PK profile of DFP in SCD subjects is consistent with previous reports in healthy adult volunteers, suggesting no special dosing adjustments are indicated for this population. These findings provide valuable insight for treating iron overload in patients with SCD, who have limited chelation therapy treatment options (trial registration number: NCT01835496, date of registration: April 19, 2013).
33638018		Stroke and presence of patent foramen ovale in sickle cell disease.Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited monogenic hemoglobinopathy characterized by formation of sickle erythrocytes under conditions of deoxygenation. Sickle erythrocytes can lead to thrombus formation and vaso-occlusive episodes that may result in hemolytic anemia, pain crisis and multiple organ damage. Moreover, SCD is characterized by endothelial damage, increased inflammatory response, platelet activation and aggravation, and activation of both the intrinsic and the extrinsic coagulation pathways. Cerebrovascular events constitute an important clinical complication of SCD. Children with SCD have a 300-fold higher risk of acute stroke and by the age of 45 about 25% of patients have suffered an overt stoke. Management and prevention of stroke in patients with SCD is not well defined. Moreover, the presence of patent foramen ovale (PFO) increases the risk of the occurrence of an embolic cerebrovascular event. The role of PFO closure and antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy has not been well investigated. Moreover, during COVID-19 pandemic and taking into account the increased rates of thrombotic events and the difficulties in blood transfusion, management of SCD patients is even more challenging and difficult, since data are scarce regarding stroke occurrence and management in this specific population in the COVID-19 era. This review focuses on pathophysiology of stroke in patients with SCD and possible treatment strategies in the presence of PFO.

38066894		The range of haploidentical transplant protocols in sickle cell disease: all haplos are not created equally.The ideal curative therapy for sickle cell disease (SCD) must be applicable across all ages and include individuals with strokes and preexisting heart, lung, and kidney disease. Myeloablative, matched sibling donor hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) for children with SCD has shown excellent outcomes over the past 3 decades but has been restricted due to the limited availability of a human leukocyte antigen-matched sibling donor (10%-15%) and increased treatment-related death in adults with myeloablative conditioning. To overcome these 2 significant barriers to curative therapy in SCD, related haploidentical HCT has become an active area of research. The use of related haploidentical donors (first- and second-degree relatives) increases the donor pool to at least 90% of those eligible across the life span. Importantly, most adults, even with strokes or significant comorbidities, can tolerate the nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen without treatment-related death. Since 2013, at least 3 related haploidentical HCT strategies have emerged as potential curative therapies for SCD: (1) a nonmyeloablative, T-cell replete, bone marrow transplant with thiotepa and posttransplant cyclophosphamide with a goal of complete donor chimerism; (2) a nonmyeloablative, in vivo T-cell depletion, using peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) with a goal of stable mixed donor-recipient chimerism; and (3) a myeloablative, ex vivo T-cell depletion using PBSCs and advanced-technology graft manipulation, with a goal of complete donor chimerism. We review the similarities, differences, outcomes, and gaps in knowledge with these 3 haploidentical HCT approaches for SCD.

35788790	treat|@CHEMICAL_crizanlizumab|@DISEASE_Pain ;treat|@CHEMICAL_Glutamine|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell ;treat|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell	Sickle Cell Disease: A Review.Importance: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited disorder of hemoglobin, characterized by formation of long chains of hemoglobin when deoxygenated within capillary beds, resulting in sickle-shaped red blood cells, progressive multiorgan damage, and increased mortality. An estimated 300 000 infants are born annually worldwide with SCD. Most individuals with SCD live in sub-Saharan Africa, India, the Mediterranean, and Middle East; approximately 100 000 individuals with SCD live in the US. Observations: SCD is diagnosed through newborn screening programs, where available, or when patients present with unexplained severe atraumatic pain or normocytic anemia. In SCD, sickling and hemolysis of red blood cells result in vaso-occlusion with associated ischemia. SCD is characterized by repeated episodes of severe acute pain and acute chest syndrome, and by other complications including stroke, chronic pain, nephropathy, retinopathy, avascular necrosis, priapism, and leg ulcers. In the US, nearly all children with SCD survive to adulthood, but average life expectancy remains 20 years less than the general population, with higher mortality as individuals transition from pediatric to adult-focused health care systems. Until 2017, hydroxyurea, which increases fetal hemoglobin and reduces red blood cell sickling, was the only disease-modifying therapy available for SCD and remains first-line therapy for most individuals with SCD. Three additional therapies, L-glutamine, crizanlizumab, and voxelotor, have been approved as adjunctive or second-line agents. In clinical trials, L-glutamine reduced hospitalization rates by 33% and mean length of stay from 11 to 7 days compared with placebo. Crizanlizumab reduced pain crises from 2.98 to 1.63 per year compared with placebo. Voxelotor increased hemoglobin by at least 1 g/dL, significantly more than placebo (51% vs 7%). Hematopoietic stem cell transplant is the only curative therapy, but it is limited by donor availability, with best results seen in children with a matched sibling donor. While SCD is characterized by acute and chronic pain, patients are not more likely to develop addiction to pain medications than the general population. Conclusions and Relevance: In the US, approximately 100 000 people have SCD, which is characterized by hemolytic anemia, acute and chronic pain, acute chest syndrome; increased incidence of stroke, nephropathy, and retinopathy; and a life span that is 20 years shorter than the general population. While hydroxyurea is first-line therapy for SCD, L-glutamine, crizanlizumab, and voxelotor have been approved in the US since 2017 as adjunctive or second-line treatments, and hematopoietic stem cell transplant with a matched sibling donor is now standard care for severe disease.
37581462		Improved Quality of Life of Patients With Sickle Cell Disease after Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplant: Another Indication for Transplant.BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is frequently inherited worldwide. The severity of SCD ranges from mild to severe, and the disease involves multiple complications, including pulmonary hypertension, stroke, recurrent vaso-occlusive crises, end-organ damage, and an increased mortality risk. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is a potentially curative option for patients with SCD. OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY: The objective was to assess the quality of life of adolescent and adult patients with SCD receiving HCT pre-and post-transplant. METHODS: An analytical cross-sectional study was conducted. Patients with SCD with at least one year of follow-up after HCT were interviewed to assess their quality of life pre-and post-transplant. This study was conducted at the Transplant Center of King Abdulaziz Medical City, Riyadh. The participants were identified through non-probability consecutive sampling. The FACT-G questionnaire was used to assess the quality of life domains. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients were included. The median age of the respondents was 32 +- 6.3 years, and 16 were male (51.6%). The most frequent indication for stem cell transplantation (58%) was a vaso-occlusive crisis. The mean FACT-G scores pre- and post-transplantation were 55.2 +- 18.17 and 91 +- 14.58, respectively. The mean number of annual ER visits was significantly reduced from 27.3 pre-transplant to 6.6 post-transplant (P-value = 0.006). Of the respondents, 51.6% experienced no severe complications post-transplantation, and most (93.5%) reported improved quality of life. CONCLUSION: HCT significantly improved the quality of life of adult patients with SCD, with improvements in most FACT-G score domains. Although it was not measured by the FACT-G, the frequency of ER visits and hospital admissions were reduced significantly post-transplant, reflecting an improvement in the quality of life and a reduction in the cost of therapy for patients with SCD.
35817521	associate|@CHEMICAL_Iron|@DISEASE_Kidney_Diseases	Sickle Cell Disease and Kidney.Sickle cell disease causes several kidney manifestations. They include defects in urine concentration, impaired handling of potassium and hydrogen ion, albuminuria, acute kidney injury, and chronic kidney disease to name a few. Glomerular hyperfiltration, tubular hyperfunctioning, endothelial damage from repeated sickling and vaso-occlusive episodes, and iron-induced proinflammatory changes in the glomerular mesangium and tubulointerstitium are some of the mechanisms of kidney damage. Albuminuria is one of the most and common clinical features of kidney disease and progresses with age. Kidney disease in patients with sickle cell is associated with increased mortality. Annual screening for proteinuria starting at age 10 years and limiting the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may help in early detection and delaying the progression of kidney disease. Adequate hydration, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and adequate control of sickle cell are the main stay of treatment for albuminuria. The hemoglobin goal for patients with sickle cell nephropathy is lesser (10 g/dL) than that for patients with chronic kidney disease due to other causes given that a higher hemoglobin level increases viscosity and the risk of precipitating vaso-occlusive episodes. A multidisciplinary approach is recommended for managing patients with sickle cell and kidney diseases.

We report our clinic's experience converting 36 patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) from full agonist opioids to buprenorphine using a method developed in the past 10 years. Thirty of these patients were induced using a standard outpatient protocol and six were induced during medical admissions. Typically, patients were on high-dose chronic opioid therapy (COT) with inadequate response, and often with very high acute care utilization. Unlike prior case series, the method of induction, dosing, and management of withdrawal are detailed, as are post-induction adverse events. There were seven adverse events in the first 3 days following standard induction, and two of which were judged to be definitely related to the induction but none with any lasting sequelae. At 6 months follow-up, five participants had discontinued buprenorphine (16.67%), and overall acute care visits dropped from a mean of 10.50 (SD 11.35) in the 6 months pre-induction to 2.89 (SD 3.40) in the 6 months post-induction. In an appropriately interdisciplinary care setting, buprenorphine shows promise as a safe alternative to COT with early evidence of benefit for high-utilizing patients with SCD.
36795882		Diagnostic Ultrasonography in Neurology.OBJECTIVE: Ultrasonography allows neurologists to complement clinical information with additional useful, easily acquired, real-time data. This article highlights its clinical applications in neurology. LATEST DEVELOPMENTS: Diagnostic ultrasonography is expanding its applications with smaller and better devices. Most indications in neurology relate to cerebrovascular evaluations. Ultrasonography contributes to the etiologic evaluation and is helpful for hemodynamic diagnosis of brain or eye ischemia. It can accurately characterize cervical vascular atherosclerosis, dissection, vasculitis, or other rarer disorders. Ultrasonography can aid in the diagnosis of intracranial large vessel stenosis or occlusion and evaluation of collateral pathways and indirect hemodynamic signs of more proximal and distal pathology. Transcranial Doppler (TCD) is the most sensitive method for detecting paradoxical emboli from a systemic right-left shunt such as a patent foramen ovale. TCD is mandatory for sickle cell disease surveillance, guiding the timing for preventive transfusion. In subarachnoid hemorrhage, TCD is useful in monitoring vasospasm and adapting treatment. Some arteriovenous shunts can be detected by ultrasonography. Cerebral vasoregulation studies are another developing field of interest. TCD enables monitoring of hemodynamic changes related to intracranial hypertension and can diagnose cerebral circulatory arrest. Optic nerve sheath measurement and brain midline deviation are ultrasonography-detectable signs of intracranial hypertension. Most importantly, ultrasonography allows for easily repeated monitoring of evolving clinical conditions or during and after interventions. ESSENTIAL POINTS: Diagnostic ultrasonography is an invaluable tool in neurology, used as an extension of the clinical examination. It helps diagnose and monitor many conditions, allowing for more data-driven and rapid treatment interventions.

METHODS: The components were identified in the literature. Six databases were searched for targets of CPL. Enrichment analysis was used to determine the targets associated with anemia and in bone marrow. Based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database, pathways and targets related to hematopoiesis were obtained. The key targets were obtained by protein-protein interaction analysis. Molecular docking was used to analyze the binding ability of key targets and active components. Bone marrow cells were used as an experimental model to verify the drug efficacy. RESULTS: A total of 139 components and 1868 targets of CPL were retrieved from the literature. By disease enrichment analysis, 543 targets for hemorrhagic anemia, 223 targets for aplastic anemia, and 126 targets for sickle cell anemia were obtained. Target organ enrichment yielded 27, 29, and 20 targets of bone marrow. Based on KEGG pathway enrichment, a total of 47 shared hematopoietic pathways and 42 related targets were found. The key targets were vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), interleukin 10 (IL-10), platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM1), C-C motif chemokine 2 (CCL2), and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1). The CPL active components included ursolic acid, quercetin, and hesperidin. The expression of VEGFA was significantly increased after CPL treatment. Quercetin and ursolic acid acted on VEGFA. Quercetin and Hesperidin acted on VCAM1. Quercetin acted on IL-10, CCL2, VCAM1, and VEGFA. Cell experiments revealed that CPL could promote the proliferation and migration of bone marrow cells. CONCLUSIONS: CPL has the synergistic efficacy of treating anemia through multiple components, targets, and pathways.
37066693		Outcome of premarital genetic counseling for couples at risk of hemoglobinopathies in Kingdom of Bahrain.OBJECTIVES: Hemoglobinopathies are the commonest inherited blood disorders and form a serious burden worldwide, affecting communities, patient quality of life and healthcare resources. The Kingdom of Bahrain has issued a law obligating couples to undergo premarital screening to detect those at risk of having children affected with these disorders. The aim of this study was to analyze the marital decisions of couples at risk for hemoglobinopathies and follow up the outcomes. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on couples at risk for hemoglobinopathies identified during the premarital screening program at local health centers in the Kingdom of Bahrain and referred to the genetics department in the Salmaniya Medical Complex for genetic counselling in 2018-2020. RESULTS: A total of 189 couples were found to be at risk for hemoglobinopathies, of whom 159 completed the survey. Of these, 107 (67%) decided to proceed with their marriage and 26 couples achieved pregnancy. Out of 24 at-risk pregnancies with known outcome, 83.3% were spontaneous whereas only 16.7% underwent in-vitro fertilization (IVF) with preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). Eight out of 20 infants born to couples after spontaneous conception were affected. A positive attitude toward IVF with PGD was held by 60% of at-risk couples. CONCLUSIONS: Despite undergoing premarital screening and genetic counselling, a large percentage of at-risk couples proceeded with their marriage. Most of them justified their decision due to the availability of advanced methods that aid in the prevention of having an affected child. However, the cost of such intervention was a major barrier for the majority of couples.
35761209		Transcranial doppler as screening method for sickling crises in children with sickle cell anemia: a latin America cohort study.BACKGROUND: Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is the leading cause of childhood stroke. We aimed to evaluate whether altered cerebral flow velocities, as measured by transcranial Doppler (TCD), are associated with vaso-occlusive complications in addition to stroke in pediatric SCA patients. METHODS: We evaluated 37 children aged between 2 and 16 years with SCA who underwent screening for TCD between January 2012 and October 2018. Genotypic profiles and demographic data were collected, TCD examinations were performed during follow-up, and the presence of sickling crises was compared. Survival analyses were performed using simple frailty models, in which each predictor variable was analyzed separately in relation to the occurrence of a sickling crisis. RESULTS: The variables related to sickle cell crises in the univariate analysis were peak systolic velocity (PSV) in the middle cerebral artery (MCA), hazard ratio (HR) 1.01 (1.00-1.02) p = 0.04; end-diastolic velocity (EDV) in the MCA, HR 1.02 (1.01-1.04) p = 0.01; time average mean maximum velocity (TAMMV) in the basilar artery (BA), HR 1.02 (1.00-1.04) p = 0.04; hemoglobin, HR 0.49 (0.38-0.65) p < 0.001; hematocrit, HR 0.78 (0.71-0.85) p < 0.001; leukocyte counts, HR 1.1 (1.05-1.15) p < 0.001; platelets counts, HR 0.997 (0.994-0.999) p = 0.02; and reticulocyte numbers, HR 1.14 (1.06-1.23) p < 0.001. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate PSV and EDV in the MCA and TAMMV in the BA as markers of risk for the occurrence of sickling crises in SCA.
34054041	associate|@DISEASE_Arterial_Occlusive_Diseases|@GENE_TNNI3	Clinical Utilities of Electrocardiography in the Diagnosis of Myocardial Ischemia in Children With Sickle Cell Anemia: Correlation With Serum Cardiac Troponin I.BACKGROUND: Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is associated with recurrent vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) and the risk of myocardial ischemia (MI). This study investigated the utility of electrocardiography (ECG) and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) in diagnosing MI during VOC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Children with SCA 5 to 15 years of age in VOC (patients) and age-matched and sex-matched steady-state controls were studied. Their ECG and cTnI levels were measured at contact and after 4 to 6 weeks. RESULTS: One hundred eighty-six children (93 patients and 93 controls) were studied. The mean (SD) ages of the patients and controls were 8.8 (3.2) and 9.0 (3.1) years, respectively. The mean MI score was significantly higher for the patients, 1.7 (1.2), than the controls, 1.3 (1.0), P=0.002. A significantly higher proportion of the patients, 18 (19.4%), also had significant ischemia compared with the controls, 8 (8.6%), P=0.016. The median (interquartile range) serum cTnI level was significantly higher in the patients than the controls, P=0.006. All 7 of the patients with elevated cTnI had VOC. No significant correlation was found between MI score and cTnI in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: cTnI is elevated and ECG features of MI worsen during VOC. Longitudinal studies to investigate their evolvement over time are advocated.
35543673		Influence of user-centered clinical decision support on pediatric blood product ordering errors.BACKGROUND: Children are at increased risk from transfusion-related medical errors. Clinical decision support (CDS) can enhance pediatric providers' decision-making regarding transfusion practices including indications, volume, rate, and special processing instructions. Our objective was to use CDS in a pediatric health system to reduce:blood product-related safety events from ordering errors;special processing ordering errors for patients with T-cell dysfunction, sickle cell disease (SCD), or thalassemia;transfusions administered faster than 5 mL/kg/h. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this single-center before and after quality improvement study, we evaluated how user-centered design of pediatric blood product orders influenced pediatric transfusion practices and outcomes. Safety events were identified through active and passive surveillance. Other clinically relevant outcomes were identified through electronic health record queries. RESULTS: Blood product-related safety events from ordering errors did not change significantly from the baseline period (6 events, 0.4 per month, from 1/1/2018-3/27/2019) to the intervention period (1 event, 0.1 per month, from 3/28/2019-12/31/2019; rate ratio: 0.27 [0.01-2.25]). Packed red blood cell (PRBC) and platelet orders for patients with T-cell dysfunction that did not specify irradiation decreased significantly from 488/12,359 (3.9%) to 204/6,711 (3.0%, risk ratio: 0.77 [0.66-0.90]). PRBC orders for patients with SCD or thalassemia that did not specify phenotypically similar units fell from 386/2,876 (13.4%) to 57/1,755 (3.2%, risk ratio: 0.24 [0.18-0.32]). Transfusions administered faster than 5 mL/kg/h decreased from 4,112/14,641 (28.1%) to 2,125/9,263 (22.9%, risk ratio: 0.82 [0.78-0.85]). DISCUSSION: User-centered design of CDS for pediatric blood product orders significantly reduced special processing ordering errors and inappropriate transfusion rates. Larger studies are needed to evaluate the impact on safety events.

The iron chelator deferiprone is frequently used in individuals with thalassemia syndromes, but data in patients with SCD are limited. This open-label study assessed the efficacy and safety of deferiprone in patients with SCD or other anemias receiving chronic transfusion therapy. A total of 228 patients (mean age: 16.9 [range, 3-59] years; 46.9% female) were randomized to receive either oral deferiprone (n = 152) or subcutaneous deferoxamine (n = 76). The primary endpoint was change from baseline at 12 months in liver iron concentration (LIC), assessed by R2* magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The least squares mean (standard error) change in LIC was -4.04 (0.48) mg/g dry weight for deferiprone vs -4.45 (0.57) mg/g dry weight for deferoxamine, with noninferiority of deferiprone to deferoxamine demonstrated by analysis of covariance (least squares mean difference 0.40 [0.56]; 96.01% confidence interval, -0.76 to 1.57). Noninferiority of deferiprone was also shown for both cardiac T2* MRI and serum ferritin. Rates of overall adverse events (AEs), treatment-related AEs, serious AEs, and AEs leading to withdrawal did not differ significantly between the groups. AEs related to deferiprone treatment included abdominal pain (17.1% of patients), vomiting (14.5%), pyrexia (9.2%), increased alanine transferase (9.2%) and aspartate transferase levels (9.2%), neutropenia (2.6%), and agranulocytosis (0.7%). The efficacy and safety profiles of deferiprone were acceptable and consistent with those seen in patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia. This trial study was registered at www://clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT02041299.
34121736		Co-Inheritance of alpha-thalassemia gene mutation in patients with sickle cell Disease: Impact on clinical and hematological variables.BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a monogenic, phenotypically highly variable disease with multisystem pathology. The phenotypic heterogeneity of SCD is attributed to environmental and genetic factors such as fetal hemoglobin and co-inheritance of alpha-thalassemia. OBJECTIVES: To look for different types of alpha-thalassemia gene mutations among SCD patients and evaluate the influence of the co-inheritance of alpha-thalassemia on clinical and hematological variables. METHODS: This cross-sectional analytical study included 765 SCD patients, and 150 patients (with low mean corpuscular volume (MCV), low mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and normal serum ferritin levels) were tested for alpha-thalassemia gene mutations. Multiplex PCR and reverse hybridization and sequencing for both alpha genes using the Vienna Lab Strip Assay PCR study were performed using conventional PCR technology. RESULTS: Out of 150 patients tested for alpha-thalassemia gene mutations, 141 patients were found to have one or more of the mutational types, representing 18.4% of all studied SCD patients. The most common mutations found were the -3.7 deletion (76.6%), followed by the -4.2 deletion (12.1%), mutant alpha2polyA-1 (Saudi type) (9.2%), and --MED double gene deletion (7.8%). Acute painful episodes did not differ significantly in sickle cell anemia (SCA) patients with or without alpha-thalassemia, although the co-inheritance of alpha-thalassemia has a protective role against many disease-related complications. However, this role was not observed with other types of SCD. The means of red blood cell count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit were significantly higher, while the MCV, MCH, reticulocyte count, and hemoglobin A2 percentage were significantly lower in patients with alpha-thalassemia gene mutations than in those without alpha-thalassemia gene mutations (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The co-inheritance of alpha-thalassemia and SCA confers protection against many disease-related complications and is associated with improved hematological indices. However, this protection was not noticed in patients with other types of SCD.
35972997		Reassessing the Need for Preoperative Transfusions in Sickle Cell Disease Patients with an Elevated Baseline Hemoglobin-a Retrospective Study.BACKGROUND: Current guidelines recommend a preoperative hemoglobin of 10.0 g/dL in patients with sickle cell disease [SCD], however, this threshold continues to be an area of controversy. Previous studies demonstrating the benefits of preoperative transfusions have largely not captured patients with elevated baseline hemoglobin, in part due to low hydroxyurea uptake and exclusion of nonhemoglobin SS SCD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients with SCD <18 years of age undergoing low and medium-risk procedures at 2 academic medical centers in Canada between 2007 and 2017. The primary objective was to study the association of preoperative transfusion on postoperative complications in patients with SCD with baseline hemoglobin between 9.0 and 10.0 g/dL. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the adjusted effect of preoperative transfusion on the risk of developing postoperative complications. RESULTS: In all, 159 procedures in patients with hemoglobin <9.0 g/dL [Hb<9.0] and 173 procedures in patients with hemoglobin between 9.0 and 10.0 g/dL [Hb9.0-10.0] were analyzed. In the absence of preoperative transfusion, Hb9.0-10.0 patients had lower overall complications [23% vs. 34%] compared with Hb<9.0 patients [OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.12-0.72, P=0.008]. In total, 75% of Hb<9.0 and 21% of Hb9.0-10.0 patients received a preoperative simple transfusion. Transfusion was associated with increased risk of postoperative complications in Hb9.0-10.0 [OR 3.02, 95% CI 1.26-7.23, P=0.013], but not Hb<9.0 patients [OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.28-1.45, P=0.30]. CONCLUSIONS: Simple transfusion may not be warranted in Hb9.0-10.0 patients undergoing low-risk procedures. Prospective studies validating these findings are needed.
35164913		Chronic Osteomyelitis of Long Bones: Imaging Pearls and Pitfalls in Pediatrics.Chronic bacterial osteomyelitis is characterized by progressive inflammatory bone destruction and apposition of new bone most often caused by pyogenic bacteria. Clinical findings are nonspecific, and serum inflammatory markers can be normal. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are essential. Left untreated, chronic infection can lead to high morbidity and mortality. Imaging's major role is to suggest the correct diagnosis, exclude other diagnoses that can mimic osteomyelitis, document extent of disease, and guide interventions such as image-guided biopsy or surgical debridement. Several conditions can mimic chronic osteomyelitis clinically and radiographically. The main differential diagnoses include an oncologic process, chronic nonbacterial or chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis, bone infarct in sickle cell disease, osteoid osteoma, and stress reaction/fracture. The oncologic process to consider includes metastatic neuroblastoma and Langerhans cell histiocytosis in a child younger than five years or leukemia, Ewing sarcoma, and osteosarcoma in the older age group. However, these lesions can typically be excluded based on radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging findings. Therefore, radiologist familiarity with imaging findings and mimickers is essential. In this article, we briefly review the epidemiologic, clinical, and histopathologic features of chronic bacterial osteomyelitis and emphasize imaging pearls and pitfalls, with discussion of the most common differential diagnoses.
37449655	associate|@CHEMICAL_Iron|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell ;treat|@CHEMICAL_Iron|@DISEASE_Transfusion_Reaction	Pregnancy and assisted reproductive technology use in Australian female transfusion-dependent haemoglobinopathy patients: a 20-year retrospective analysis.BACKGROUND: In the last few decades, the life expectancy of patients with transfusion-dependent thalassaemia (TDT) and sickle cell disease (SCD) has improved significantly, in part because of improved iron chelation. Fertility challenges and pregnancy complications have historically limited reproductive options in this group; however, improved multi-disciplinary care has made infertility a chronic disease complication requiring attention. Despite this, there are very few reports and no Australian data describing fertility and pregnancy outcomes in this population. AIMS: To identify the rate of assisted reproductive technologies (ART) utilisation in our female transfusion-dependent haemoglobinopathy patients and to establish the nature of maternal and neonatal complications in this cohort. METHODS: A 20-year retrospective analysis (1997-2017) at an Australian centre captured data on conception rates, use of assisted reproductive techniques (ART), and pregnancy and neonatal outcomes in female transfusion-dependent haemoglobinopathy patients. RESULTS: Conception was attempted in 14 women (11 TDT and three SCD) during the study period. A total of 28 pregnancies resulting in 25 live births were recorded. ART supported 13 conceptions. A positive association was not identified between elevated mean serum ferritin and ART use; however, all patients with an established diagnosis of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) required ART. Maternal complications included gestational diabetes mellitus and post-partum haemorrhage. There were no cardiac complications. Two-thirds of women underwent lower segment caesarean section, with prematurity complicating 20% of births. There were no neonatal or maternal deaths. CONCLUSION: Pregnancy is an achievable goal for women with transfusion-dependent haemoglobinopathies, although the support of ART may be required in a subset of patients.
38104758		Exploring Patient Demographics and Presence of Retinal Vascular Disease in Paracentral Acute Middle Maculopathy.PURPOSE: To investigate the sociodemographic profile, the association with retinal vascular diseases (RVD) and systemic comorbidities, and visual outcomes of patients with paracentral acute middle maculopathy (PAMM) in a large, ethnically diverse single-center cohort. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. METHODS: Electronic health record query for all patients presenting with PAMM at Moorfields Eye Hospital, London, was completed. Detailed demographic, clinical, and systemic information were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 78 eyes of 78 patients with confirmed PAMM were included in the study. Forty patients (51.3%) presented with no RVD, 20 patients (25.6%) with retinal vein occlusion (RVO), 16 patients (20.5%) with retinal artery occlusion (RAO), and 2 patients (2.6%) with concomitant RAO and RVO. Patients with PAMM+RAO were older than those with RVO (P = .02) and more likely to have a history of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) (P = .01), with a significantly worse presenting best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) (20/50) compared to patients with RVO (P = .02) and no RVD (P < .001). Individuals with isolated PAMM had a significantly higher prevalence of previous MACE (P = .04) and sickle cell disease (SCD) (P = .04) compared to those with RVO. At the last follow-up, 64 patients (85.3%) had a good BCVA (>20/32). CONCLUSIONS: The significant association of PAMM with RVD supports the hypothesis of an ischemic etiology. Individuals with isolated PAMM had a higher prevalence of MACE and SCD. Thus, it is important to prompt immediate referral for a comprehensive systemic evaluation. Across the whole cohort, PAMM was associated with good BCVA improvement during follow-up, indicating a good visual prognosis.

In 2019, voxelotor (1500 mg), an oral once-daily sickle haemoglobin polymerisation inhibitor, was approved in the USA for the treatment of sickle cell disease in patients aged 12 years and older on the basis of HOPE trial data. To further describe the applicability of voxelotor as a treatment for this chronic illness, we report the long-term efficacy and safety of this drug at 72 weeks of treatment; the conclusion of the placebo-controlled HOPE trial. METHODS: HOPE is an international, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial done at 60 clinical sites in Canada, Egypt, France, Italy, Jamaica, Kenya, Lebanon, Netherlands, Oman, Turkey, the USA, and the UK. Patients (aged 12-65 years) with confirmed sickle cell disease, a haemoglobin concentration of 5 5-10 5 g/dL at enrolment, and who had between one and ten vaso-occlusive crisis events in the previous 12 months were enrolled. Patients receiving regularly scheduled transfusion therapy, who had received a transfusion in the previous 60 days, or who had been admitted to hospital for a vaso-occlusive crisis in the previous 14 days were excluded. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive either once-daily oral voxelotor 1500 mg, voxelotor 900 mg, or placebo for 72 weeks. Randomisation was done centrally by use of an interactive web response system, stratified by baseline hydroxyurea use (yes vs no), age group (adolescents [12 to <18 years] vs adults [18 to 65 years]), and geographic region (North America vs Europe vs other). The primary endpoint (already reported) was the proportion of patients who achieved a haemoglobin response at week 24. In this final analysis, we report prespecified long-term efficacy assessments by intention to treat, including changes in haemoglobin concentrations from baseline to week 72, changes in the concentration of haemolysis markers (absolute and percentage reticulocytes, indirect bilirubin concentrations, and lactate dehydrogenase concentrations) from baseline to week 72, the annualised incidence of vaso-occlusive crises, and patient functioning, as assessed with the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) scale. Safety was assessed in patients who received at least one dose of treatment (modified intention-to-treat population). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03036813. FINDINGS: Between Dec 5, 2016, and May 3, 2018, 449 patients were screened, of whom 274 were randomly assigned to the voxelotor 1500 mg group (n=90), the voxelotor 900 mg group (n=92), or the placebo group (n=92). At week 72, the adjusted mean change in haemoglobin concentration from baseline was 1 0 g/dL (95% CI 0 7 to -1 3) in the voxelotor 1500 mg group, 0 5 g/dL (0 3 to -0 8) in the voxelotor 900 mg group, and 0 0 g/dL (-0 3 to 0 3) in the placebo group, with a significant difference observed between the voxelotor 1500 mg group and the placebo group (p<0 0001), and between the voxelotor 900 mg group and the placebo group (p=0 014). Significant improvements in markers of haemolysis, as assessed by the difference in adjusted mean percentage change from baseline at week 72 versus placebo, were observed in the voxelotor 1500 mg group in indirect bilirubin concentrations (-26 6% [95% CI -40 2 to -12 9]) and percentage of reticulocytes (-18 6% [-33 9 to -3 3]). The proportion of patients in the voxelotor 1500 mg group who were rated as "moderately improved" or "very much improved" at week 72 with the CGI-C was significantly greater than in the placebo group (39 [74%] of 53 vs 24 [47%] of 51; p=0 0057). Serious adverse events unrelated to sickle cell disease were reported in 25 (28%) of 88 patients in the voxelotor 1500 mg group, 20 (22%) of 92 patients in the voxelotor 900 mg group, and 23 (25%) of 91 patients in the placebo group. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were infrequent (ie, occurred in <10% of patients); anaemia occurred in five or more patients (two [2%] patients in the voxelotor 1500 mg group, seven [8%] patients in the voxelotor 900 mg group, and three [3%] patients in the placebo group). Of all 274 patients, six (2%) deaths occurred during the study (two deaths in each treatment group), all of which were judged as unrelated to treatment. INTERPRETATION: Voxelotor 1500 mg resulted in rapid and durable improvements in haemoglobin concentrations maintained over 72 weeks and has potential to address the substantial morbidity associated with haemolytic anaemia in sickle cell disease.

36412212	treat|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell	Risk of vaso-occlusive episodes in patients with sickle cell disease exposed to systemic corticosteroids: a comprehensive review.INTRODUCTION: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most frequent inherited disorder in the world. It is caused by a single amino acid mutation on the beta-globin chain, which lead to red blood cell deformation, haemolysis, and chronic inflammation. Clinical consequences are vaso-occlusives crisis, acute chest syndrome, thrombosis, infection, and chronic endothelial injury. AREAS COVERED: Corticosteroids are an old therapeutic class, that are inexpensive and widely available, which can be administered in different forms. Their adverse effects are numerous and well-known. This class could appear to be useful in SCD treatment due to its anti-inflammatory effect. Moreover, corticosteroids remain an essential therapeutic class for many indications, besides SCD. Although specific adverse effects of corticosteroids have been suspected in SCD patients for decades, recent papers has reported strong evidence of specific and severe adverse effects in this population. Based on a literature review, we will discuss pathophysiological considerations, consequences, and practical use of corticosteroids in SCD. EXPERT OPINION: High corticosteroid doses, for any indication , induce vaso-occlusive crises, acute chest syndrome, and re-hospitalization in patients with SCD. There is no evidence of any benefits of corticosteroid use in the SCD acute events. Prevention by hydroxyurea and/or red blood cell transfusion or exchange should be discussed when corticosteroid use is indispensable.

Sickle hemoglobin polymerizes under hypoxic conditions, producing deformed red cells that hemolyze and cause vaso-occlusion that results in progressive organ damage and early death. Elevated fetal hemoglobin levels in red cells protect against complications of sickle cell disease. OTQ923, a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9-edited CD34+ hematopoietic stem- and progenitor-cell (HSPC) product, has a targeted disruption of the HBG1 and HBG2 (gamma-globin) gene promoters that increases fetal hemoglobin expression in red-cell progeny. METHODS: We performed a tiling CRISPR-Cas9 screen of the HBG1 and HBG2 promoters by electroporating CD34+ cells obtained from healthy donors with Cas9 complexed with one of 72 guide RNAs, and we assessed the fraction of fetal hemoglobin-immunostaining erythroblasts (F cells) in erythroid-differentiated progeny. The gRNA resulting in the highest level of F cells (gRNA-68) was selected for clinical development. We enrolled participants with severe sickle cell disease in a multicenter, phase 1-2 clinical study to assess the safety and adverse-effect profile of OTQ923. RESULTS: In preclinical experiments, CD34+ HSPCs (obtained from healthy donors and persons with sickle cell disease) edited with CRISPR-Cas9 and gRNA-68 had sustained on-target editing with no off-target mutations and produced high levels of fetal hemoglobin after in vitro differentiation or xenotransplantation into immunodeficient mice. In the study, three participants received autologous OTQ923 after myeloablative conditioning and were followed for 6 to 18 months. At the end of the follow-up period, all the participants had engraftment and stable induction of fetal hemoglobin (fetal hemoglobin as a percentage of total hemoglobin, 19.0 to 26.8%), with fetal hemoglobin broadly distributed in red cells (F cells as a percentage of red cells, 69.7 to 87.8%). Manifestations of sickle cell disease decreased during the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: CRISPR-Cas9 disruption of the HBG1 and HBG2 gene promoters was an effective strategy for induction of fetal hemoglobin. Infusion of autologous OTQ923 into three participants with severe sickle cell disease resulted in sustained induction of red-cell fetal hemoglobin and clinical improvement in disease severity.

33855970		Genetic therapies for the first molecular disease.Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a monogenic disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of severe bone pain, multi-organ failure, and early mortality. Although medical progress over the past several decades has improved clinical outcomes and offered cures for many affected individuals living in high-income countries, most SCD patients still experience substantial morbidity and premature death. Emerging technologies to manipulate somatic cell genomes and insights into the mechanisms of developmental globin gene regulation are generating potentially transformative approaches to cure SCD by autologous hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation. Key components of current approaches include ethical informed consent, isolation of patient HSCs, in vitro genetic modification of HSCs to correct the SCD mutation or circumvent its damaging effects, and reinfusion of the modified HSCs following myelotoxic bone marrow conditioning. Successful integration of these components into effective therapies requires interdisciplinary collaborations between laboratory researchers, clinical caregivers, and patients. Here we summarize current knowledge and research challenges for each key component, emphasizing that the best approaches have yet to be developed.
38069808		High hydroxyurea usage in sickle cell anemia regardless of patient demographics.Hydroxyurea is highly effective in sickle cell disease, but it is still underutilized. Reports of hydroxyurea utilization largely use Medicaid data, and socioeconomics is often cited as a barrier. To address whether patient demographics influenced the high hydroxyurea usage rate recently reported for the pediatric sickle cell program of Northern Virginia, analysis of data from 2011 to 2021 revealed no statistical difference in hydroxyurea usage rate between Medicaid and non-Medicaid, African American and African, or age less than 13 and age greater than or equal to 13 years cohorts, demonstrating that hydroxyurea can be successfully implemented across demographic groups.

37905989		Preferences for potential benefits and risks for gene therapy in the treatment of sickle cell disease.Objective is to quantify benefit-risk tradeoffs pertaining to potential gene therapies among adults and parents/caregivers of children with sickle-cell disease (SCD). A discrete-choice experiment (DCE) survey was developed in which respondents selected their preferred treatment alternatives in a series of experimentally-controlled pairs of hypothetical gene therapies and a "no gene therapy" option. Gene therapy alternatives were defined based on the chance of eliminating SCD symptoms, expected increases in life expectancy they could offer, treatment-related risk of death and potential increases in lifetime cancer risk. Respondents made selections based on their current disease severity and in the context of expectations of worsened disease. Three clinical sites and one patient organization recruited 174 adult patients and 109 parents of children with SCD to complete the survey. Adult and parent respondents were generally willing to choose gene therapies, but the adults required higher expected levels of efficacy (i.e., higher chance of eliminating symptoms) than parents to choose gene therapies that conferred mortality risks of 10% or more. When adults and parents of children with less severe symptoms were asked to consider scenarios of higher levels of disease severity, the risk tolerance increased, and the lowest acceptable level of efficacy for gene therapies with mortality risks dropped by more than 50%. Baseline SCD symptoms are a major driver of gene therapy acceptability. Adults and parents of patients with milder symptoms may prefer other treatment options; however, an expectation of symptoms deterioration triggers strong reassessment of the acceptable benefit-risk balance of this novel technology.
36454537		Current developmental screening practices in young children with sickle cell disease.Despite recent developmental screening guidelines, rates of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) remain lower than expected in children with sickle cell disease (SCD). A retrospective chart review identified 276 eligible patients; 214 charts were available for developmental screening and 207 charts for autism-specific screening. Developmental surveillance/screening was conducted in 70% of charts and autism-specific screening in 19% of charts. Validated tools were used in 32% of developmental screenings and 92% of autism-specific screenings. Many children (57%) were screened outside recommended ages. In conclusion, children with SCD are not regularly receiving appropriate developmental screening and surveillance by their healthcare providers.
34003573		Decision making for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in pediatric, adolescent, and young adult patients with a hemoglobinopathy-Shared or not?BACKGROUND: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) offers an established curative option for sickle cell disease (SCD) and thalassemia patients but is associated with significant risks. Decision making is a complex process and shared decision making (SDM) could be a fitting approach in case of such preference-sensitive decisions. This study investigated what level of SDM is used in conversations with hemoglobinopathy patients and/or their caregivers considering HSCT as a curative treatment option. METHODS: Longitudinal, descriptive study using the Observing-Patient-Involvement-in-Decision-Making scale (OPTION5 ) scale to determine the level of SDM in conversations with 26 hemoglobinopathy patients and/or their caregivers. RESULTS: The total mean OPTION5 score was 43%, which is a moderate SDM approach. There was no difference between conversations with thalassemia patients and SCD patients. Conversations needing an interpreter scored worse than nontranslated conversations. The best scoring OPTION5 item was item 3: "informing about the various treatment options" (mean score 2.3 on scale 0-4). For OPTION5 item 4: "eliciting patients' preferences" a more skilled effort was measured for SCD patients compared to thalassemia patients. CONCLUSIONS: The mean OPTION5 score of "moderate" was achieved mainly by giving information on available options, which is primarily a one-way communication. The SDM process can be improved by actively inviting patients to deliberate about options and including their elicited preferences in decision making.
34628053		Editing outside the body: Ex vivo gene-modification for beta-hemoglobinopathy cellular therapy.Genome editing produces genetic modifications in somatic cells, offering novel curative possibilities for sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia. These opportunities leverage clinical knowledge of hematopoietic stem cell transplant and gene transfer. Advantages to this mode of ex vivo therapy include locus-specific alteration of patient hematopoietic stem cell genomes, lack of allogeneic immune response, and avoidance of insertional mutagenesis. Despite exciting progress, many aspects of this approach remain to be optimized for ideal clinical implementation, including the efficiency and specificity of gene modification, delivery to hematopoietic stem cells, and robust and nontoxic engraftment of gene-modified cells. This review highlights genome editing as compared to other genetic therapies, the differences between editing strategies, and the clinical prospects and challenges of implementing genome editing as a novel treatment. As the world's most common monogenic disorders, the beta-hemoglobinopathies are at the forefront of bringing genome editing to the clinic and hold promise for molecular medicine to address human disease at its root.
35105914	associate|@CHEMICAL_Water|@GENE_HBG2	Potential of cell tracking velocimetry as an economical and portable hematology analyzer.Anemia and iron deficiency continue to be the most prevalent nutritional disorders in the world, affecting billions of people in both developed and developing countries. The initial diagnosis of anemia is typically based on several markers, including red blood cell (RBC) count, hematocrit and total hemoglobin. Using modern hematology analyzers, erythrocyte parameters such as mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), etc. are also being used. However, most of these commercially available analyzers pose several disadvantages: they are expensive instruments that require significant bench space and are heavy enough to limit their use to a specific lab and lead to a delay in results, making them less practical as a point-of-care instrument that can be used for swift clinical evaluation. Thus, there is a need for a portable and economical hematology analyzer that can be used at the point of need. In this work, we evaluated the performance of a system referred to as the cell tracking velocimetry (CTV) to measure several hematological parameters from fresh human blood obtained from healthy donors and from sickle cell disease subjects. Our system, based on the paramagnetic behavior that deoxyhemoglobin or methemoglobin containing RBCs experience when suspended in water after applying a magnetic field, uses a combination of magnets and microfluidics and has the ability to track the movement of thousands of red cells in a short period of time. This allows us to measure not only traditional RBC indices but also novel parameters that are only available for analyzers that assess erythrocytes on a cell by cell basis. As such, we report, for the first time, the use of our CTV as a hematology analyzer that is able to measure MCV, MCH, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), red cell distribution width (RDW), the percentage of hypochromic cells (which is an indicator of insufficient marrow iron supply that reflects recent iron reduction), and the correlation coefficients between these metrics. Our initial results indicate that most of the parameters measured with CTV are within the normal range for healthy adults. Only the parameters related to the red cell volume (primarily MCV and RDW) were outside the normal range. We observed significant discrepancies between the MCV measured by our technology (and also by an automated cell counter) and the manual method that calculates MCV through the hematocrit obtained by packed cell volume, which are attributed to the artifacts of plasma trapping and cell shrinkage. While there may be limitations for measuring MCV, this device offers a novel point of care instrument to provide rapid RBC parameters such as iron stores that are otherwise not rapidly available to the clinician. Thus, our CTV is a promising technology with the potential to be employed as an accurate, economical, portable and fast hematology analyzer after applying instrument-specific reference ranges or correction factors.

Although the significance of chronic anemia, hemolysis, and vasculopathy has been established, hemoglobin polymerization, which results in erythrocyte stiffness and Vaso-occlusion, is important to the pathophysiology of this disease. Clinical management is elementary, and there is scant reliable data for many treatments. The onset of cerebrovascular illness and cognitive impairment are two of the major issues associated with sickle cell disease in children, and it is only now that researchers are beginning to understand how blood transfusions and hydroxycarbamide can prevent these complications. When Vaso occlusion and inflammation occur repeatedly, the majority of organs are gradually damaged, including the brain, kidneys, lungs, bones, and cardiovascular system. This damage worsens with age. In our study, we focused on the specific pathways which are affected by the involvement of effected genes. Firstly, we retrieved the gene datasets from the publically available data source website DisGNET. Using literature-based genes, we identified 290 highly regulated genes that are directly associated with sickle cell disease. We subsequently performed a gene expression analysis and extracted a gene set using GEO2R analysis, which was then used to prune 290 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). After pruning we got 60 highly expressed genes. After identification of DEGs, we used these genes for pathway analysis. For the pathway analysis, we used Reactome software and we found that these DEGs are directly associated with 7 different pathways, which are alpha beta signaling pathways, 15 antiviral mechanism, Oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) antiviral response, interleukin 1 signaling pathways, interleukin 4 and 13, interleukin 10 signaling pathway, and aspirin ADME pathway. After pathway analysis, we can exactly relate how sickle cell disease alters the gene expression and how these genes affect the different pathways. Additionally, we performed gene ontology of 60 genes and identified the gene biological process, cellular component, and molecular functions as we mentioned in our results. With the help of our study data, there is a chance for pre-identification of sickle cell disease person. Our gene result was used as a biomarker of sickle cell disease. In this paper, our result is the primary approach for sickle cell disease; with the help of this paper any researcher can get their primary data and use that for further research.
37247190	associate|@CHEMICAL_Oxygen|@DISEASE_Anemia ;treat|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell	Effect of voxelotor on cardiopulmonary testing in youths with sickle cell anemia in a pilot study.BACKGROUND: Individuals with sickle cell anemia (SCA) exhibit decreased exercise capacity. Anemia limits oxygen-carrying capacity and affects cardiopulmonary fitness. The drug voxelotor raises hemoglobin in SCA. We hypothesized that voxelotor improves exercise capacity in youths with SCA. METHODS: In a single-center, open-label, single-arm, longitudinal interventional pilot study (NCT04581356), SCA patients aged 12 and older, stably maintained on hydroxyurea, were treated with 1500 mg voxelotor daily, and performed cardiopulmonary exercise testing before (CPET#1) and after voxelotor (CPET#2). A modified Bruce Protocol was performed on a motorized treadmill, and breath-by-breath gas exchange data were collected. Peak oxygen consumption (peak VO2 ), anaerobic threshold, O2 pulse, VE/VCO2 slope, and time exercised were compared for each participant. The primary endpoint was change in peak VO2 . Hematologic parameters were measured before each CPET. Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) and Clinician Global Impression of Change (CGIC) surveys were collected. RESULTS: Ten hemoglobin SS patients aged 12-24 completed the study. All demonstrated expected hemoglobin rise, with average +1.6 g/dL (p = .003) and P50 left shift of average -11 mmHg (p < .0001) with decreased oxygen off-loading at low pO2 . The change in % predicted peak VO2 from CPET#1 to CPET#2 ranged from -12.8% to +11.3%, with significant improvement of more than 5% in one subject, more than 5% decrease in five subjects, and insignificant change of less than 5% in four subjects. All 10 CGIC and seven of 10 PGIC responses were positive. CONCLUSION: In a plot study of 10 youths with SCA, voxelotor treatment did not improve peak VO2 in 9 out of 10 patients.
34966092	treat|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell	Spirometric Changes After Initiation of Hydroxyurea in Children With Sickle Cell Anemia.Individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD) develop a decline in lung function over time. Hydroxyurea (HU) is the most common disease-modifying therapy used in SCD. We hypothesized that children with SCD treated with HU will have a slower decline in pulmonary function. We performed a retrospective chart review of children with HbSS and HbS-beta zero thalassemia referred to pulmonology for respiratory symptoms. We compared the spirometry results at 2 time points between children on HU (HU group) and not on HU (control group). For the HU group, these endpoints were evaluated before and after being on HU. The mean time interval between 2 spirometry studies was not significantly different between the groups (2.6+-1.5 y for HU group vs. 3.0+-1.8 y for the control group; P =0.33). The mean age of patients in the HU group was 9.8+-3.8 years (55% male) and 10.7+-4.9 years (50% male) in the control group. The spirometry data was compared within and between the groups using t test. There was a significant increase in forced vital capacity in HU group during follow-up, while children in the control group showed a decline (7.2+-17.1 vs. -3.4+-18.2; P <0.01). Our study suggests that HU therapy may help preserve lung function over time in children with SCD.
36877640		Interventions for improving adherence to iron chelation therapy in people with sickle cell disease or thalassaemia.BACKGROUND: Regularly transfused people with sickle cell disease (SCD) and people with thalassaemia are at risk of iron overload. Iron overload can lead to iron toxicity in vulnerable organs such as the heart, liver and endocrine glands, which can be prevented and treated with iron-chelating agents. The intensive demands and uncomfortable side effects of therapy can have a negative impact on daily activities and wellbeing, which may affect adherence. OBJECTIVES: To identify and assess the effectiveness of different types of interventions (psychological and psychosocial, educational, medication interventions, or multi-component interventions) and interventions specific to different age groups, to improve adherence to iron chelation therapy compared to another listed intervention, or standard care in people with SCD or thalassaemia. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL (Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ProQuest Dissertations & Global Theses, Web of Science & Social Sciences Conference Proceedings Indexes and ongoing trial databases (13 December 2021). We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register (1 August 2022). SELECTION CRITERIA: For trials comparing medications or medication changes, only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were eligible for inclusion. For studies including psychological and psychosocial interventions, educational interventions, or multi-component interventions, non-randomised studies of interventions (NRSIs), controlled before-after studies, and interrupted time series studies with adherence as a primary outcome were also eligible for inclusion. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: For this update, two authors independently assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias, and extracted data. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. MAIN RESULTS: We included 19 RCTs and one NRSI published between 1997 and 2021. One trial assessed medication management, one assessed an education intervention (NRSI) and 18 RCTs were of medication interventions. Medications assessed were subcutaneous deferoxamine, and two oral chelating agents, deferiprone and deferasirox. We rated the certainty of evidence as very low to low across all outcomes identified in this review. Four trials measured quality of life (QoL) with validated instruments, but provided no analysable data and reported no difference in QoL. We identified nine comparisons of interest. 1. Deferiprone versus deferoxamine We are uncertain whether or not deferiprone affects adherence to iron chelation therapy (four RCTs, unpooled, very low-certainty evidence), all-cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 1.21; 3 RCTs, 376 participants; very low-certainty evidence), or serious adverse events (SAEs) (RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.83 to 2.46; 1 RCT, 228 participants; very low-certainty evidence).  Adherence was reported as "good", "high" or "excellent" by all seven trials, though the data could not be analysed formally: adherence ranged from 69% to 95% (deferiprone, mean 86.6%), and 71% to 93% (deferoxamine, mean 78.8%), based on five trials (474 participants) only. 2. Deferasirox versus deferoxamine We are uncertain whether or not deferasirox affects adherence to iron chelation therapy (three RCTs, unpooled, very low-certainty evidence), although medication adherence was high in all trials. We are uncertain whether or not there is any difference between the drug therapies in serious adverse events (SAEs) (SCD or thalassaemia) or all-cause mortality (thalassaemia). 3. Deferiprone versus deferasirox We are uncertain if there is a difference between oral deferiprone and deferasirox based on a single trial in children (average age 9 to 10 years) with any hereditary haemoglobinopathy in adherence, SAEs and all-cause mortality. 4. Deferasirox film-coated tablet (FCT) versus deferasirox dispersible tablet (DT) One RCT compared deferasirox in different tablet forms. There may be a preference for FCTs, shown through a trend for greater adherence (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.22; 1 RCT, 88 participants), although medication adherence was high in both groups (FCT 92.9%; DT 85.3%). We are uncertain if there is a benefit in chelation-related AEs with FCTs. We are uncertain if there is a difference in the incidence of SAEs, all-cause mortality or sustained adherence. 5. Deferiprone and deferoxamine combined versus deferiprone alone We are uncertain if there is a difference in adherence, though reporting was usually narrative as triallists report it was "excellent" in both groups (three RCTs, unpooled). We are uncertain if there is a difference in the incidence of SAEs and all-cause mortality.  6. Deferiprone and deferoxamine combined versus deferoxamine alone We are uncertain if there is a difference in adherence (four RCTs), SAEs (none reported in the trial period) and all-cause mortality (no deaths reported in the trial period). There was high adherence in all trials. 7. Deferiprone and deferoxamine combined versus deferiprone and deferasirox combined There may be a difference in favour of deferiprone and deferasirox (combined) in rates of adherence (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.99) (one RCT), although it was high (> 80%) in both groups. We are uncertain if there is a difference in SAEs, and no deaths were reported in the trial, so we cannot draw conclusions based on these data (one RCT). 8. Medication management versus standard care We are uncertain if there is a difference in QoL (one RCT), and we could not assess adherence due to a lack of reporting in the control group. 9. Education versus standard care One quasi-experimental (NRSI) study could not be analysed due to the severe baseline confounding. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The medication comparisons included in this review had higher than average adherence rates not accounted for by differences in medication administration or side effects, though often follow-up was not good (high dropout over longer trials), with adherence based on a per protocol analysis. Participants may have been selected based on higher adherence to trial medications at baseline. Also, within the clinical trial context, there is increased attention and involvement of clinicians, thus high adherence rates may be an artefact of trial participation. Real-world, pragmatic trials in community and clinic settings are needed that examine both confirmed or unconfirmed adherence strategies that may increase adherence to iron chelation therapy. Due to lack of evidence this review cannot comment on intervention strategies for different age groups.
33757549	treat|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Status_Asthmaticus ;treat|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell	Hydroxyurea and blood transfusion therapy for Sickle cell disease in South Asia: inconsistent treatment of a neglected disease.BACKGROUND: Hydroxyurea and blood transfusion therapies remain the main therapeutic strategies for Sickle cell disease. Preliminary data suggest substantial variation and inconsistencies in practice of these two therapeutic modalities in South Asia. In this systematic review we searched Medline, Cochrane library and Scopus for articles on usage of hydroxyurea and blood transfusion therapies for sickle cell disease in South Asia published in English between October 2005 and October 2020. RESULTS: We selected 41 papers: 33 from India, 3 from Sri Lanka, 2 each from Pakistan and Bangladesh and one from Nepal. Only 14 prospective trials focused on hydroxyurea therapy from which majority (n = 10; 71.4%) adopted fixed low dose (10 mg/kg/day) regimen. With hydroxyurea therapy, 12 and 9 studies reported significant reductions in vaso-occlusive crises and transfusion requirement respectively. Severe anaemia (haemoglobin level < 6-7 g/dl) was the commonest indicator (n = 8) for transfusion therapy followed by vaso-occlusive crisis. CONCLUSIONS: Published data on the hydroxyurea and transfusion therapies in South Asia are limited and heterogeneous. A clear gap of knowledge exists about the nature of the sickle cell disease in the Indian subcontinent particularly from countries outside India necessitating further evidence-based assessments and interventions.
34564050		Global geographic differences in healthcare utilization for sickle cell disease pain crises in the CASiRe cohort.BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is characterized by frequent, unpredictable pain episodes and other vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs) leading to significant healthcare utilization. VOC frequency is often an endpoint in clinical trials investigating novel therapies for this devastating disease. PROCEDURE: The Consortium for the Advancement of Sickle Cell Research (CASiRe) is an international collaboration investigating clinical severity in SCD using a validated questionnaire and medical chart review standardized across four countries (United States, United Kingdom, Italy and Ghana). RESULTS: This study, focused on pain crisis incidence and healthcare utilization, included 868 patients, equally represented according to age and gender. HgbSS was the most common genotype. Patients from Ghana used the Emergency Room/Day Hospital for pain more frequently (annualized mean 2.01) than patients from other regions (annualized mean 1.56 U.S.; 1.09 U.K.; 0.02 Italy), while U.K. patients were hospitalized for pain more often (annualized mean: U.K. 2.98) than patients in other regions (annualized mean 1.98 U.S.; 1.18 Ghana; Italy 0.54). Italy's hospitalization rate for pain (annualized mean: 0.57) was nearly 20 times greater than its emergency room/day hospital only visits for pain (annualized mean: 0.03). When categorized by genotype and age, similar results were seen. CONCLUSIONS: Geographic differences in pain crisis frequency and healthcare utilization may correlate with variable organization of healthcare systems among countries and should be considered regarding trial design, endpoints, and analysis of results when investigating novel agents for clinical benefit.

35822947		Prevalence of raised body mass index in paediatric sickle cell disease.AIM: Children with sickle cell disease (SCD) have historically weighed less than their healthy peers. More recently, a retrospective chart review from six institutions in New England reported nearly one-quarter of children and adolescents with SCD had raised body mass index (BMI). This study aimed to examine rates of children with SCD with raised BMI in Mississippi compared to state and national norms and assess the correlation between haemoglobin and BMI. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of paediatric patients with SCD at the University of Mississippi Medical Center (UMMC) was conducted using data from the most recent clinic visit. Mississippi and national weight status estimates for youth 10-17 years were obtained from the 2016-2017 National Survey of Children's Health. RESULTS: For youth 10-17 years with SCD (n = 345), 21.4.% of children with SS/Sbeta  and 36.1% with SC/Sbeta+ had raised BMI compared to Mississippi and national rates, 39.2 and 31%, respectively. The prevalence of children with raised BMI with SC/Sbeta+ did not differ from state and national rates, while children with SS/Sbeta  were half as likely as their Mississippi peers to have raised BMI. Haemoglobin levels were different among children with SCD who had low BMI (8.80 g/dL), average BMI (9.2 g/dL) and raised BMI (10.5 g/dL) (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Children with SCD evaluated at UMMC have similar rates of raised BMI compared to state and national norms. Children with raised BMI have higher mean haemoglobin levels compared to children with SCD with low or average BMI. IMPLICATIONS AND CONTRIBUTION: Historically, patients with SCD have been underweight and normal weight. Our paediatric and adolescent patients with SCD now have prevalence rates of raised BMI that approach state and national rates. Further work must be done to determine whether this reflects healthier children with SCD or raises concerns about life-style-related comorbidities.

36726036		Massage therapy for children, adolescents, and young adults: Clinical delivery and effectiveness in hematology and oncology.BACKGROUND: Children, adolescents, and young adults with hematologic and/or oncologic conditions experience multiple, significant symptoms (e.g., pain, stress, and anxiety), which may be addressed by nonpharmacologic approaches such as massage therapy (MT). The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical delivery of MT provided by a certified pediatric massage therapist and assess effectiveness in two patient groups: those with sickle cell disease (SCD) or hematologic and/or oncologic conditions excluding SCD (HemOnc). METHODS: Investigators conducted a retrospective review of MT sessions provided to patients 0-39 years with hematologic and/or oncologic conditions at a large pediatric academic medical center. RESULTS: Between October 2019 and December 2021, 3015 MT sessions were provided to 243 patients (171 HemOnc; 72 SCD) and documented in the electronic health record. Patients (mean age: 12.21 +- 7.19 years) were generally White (49.4%) or Black/African American (43.2%), non-Hispanic (94.2%), and 52.3% female. Patients in the SCD group (vs. patients in the HemOnc group) reported significantly higher (p < .05) pretreatment pain (6.95 vs. 4.46), stress (6.47 vs. 4.58), and anxiety (6.67 vs. 4.59). All patients reported clinically and statistically significant (p < .001) mean reductions in pain (-2.25 +- 1.87), stress (-2.50 +- 1.73), and anxiety (-2.52 +- 1.69), with patients in the HemOnc group reporting greater mean pain change (-2.54 vs. -1.87) than patients in the SCD group. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the clinical effectiveness of MT for addressing acute pain, stress, and anxiety among youth with hematologic and/or oncologic conditions. Future research is needed to identify optimal MT utilization.
34122418		Answered and Unanswered Questions in Early-Stage Viral Vector Transduction Biology and Innate Primary Cell Toxicity for Ex-Vivo Gene Editing.Adeno-associated virus is a highly efficient DNA delivery vehicle for genome editing strategies that employ CRISPR/Cas9 and a DNA donor for homology-directed repair. Many groups have used this strategy in development of therapies for blood and immune disorders such as sickle-cell anemia and severe-combined immunodeficiency. However, recent events have called into question the immunogenicity of AAV as a gene therapy vector and the safety profile dictated by the immune response to this vector. The target cells dictating this response and the molecular mechanisms dictating cellular response to AAV are poorly understood. Here, we will investigate the current known AAV capsid and genome interactions with cellular proteins during early stage vector transduction and how these interactions may influence innate cellular responses. We will discuss the current understanding of innate immune activation and DNA damage response to AAV, and the limitations of what is currently known. In particular, we will focus on pathway differences in cell line verses primary cells, with a focus on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in the context of ex-vivo gene editing, and what we can learn from HSPC infection by other parvoviruses. Finally, we will discuss how innate immune and DNA damage response pathway activation in these highly sensitive stem cell populations may impact long-term engraftment and clinical outcomes as these gene-editing strategies move towards the clinic, with the aim to propose pathways relevant for improved hematopoietic stem cell survival and long-term engraftment after AAV-mediated genome editing.
34224433		The different facets of sickle cell disease-related pulmonary hypertension.PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Sickle cell disease (SCD), one of the most common genetic diseases in the world, is characterized by repeated episodes of hemolysis and vaso-occlusion. Hemolytic anemia is a risk factor for the development of pulmonary hypertension, and currently SCD-related pulmonary hypertension is classified as World Health Organization group 5 pulmonary hypertension. Patients with SCD-related pulmonary hypertension have unique hemodynamics, multiple comorbidities, and distinct phenotypes that may contribute to the development of pulmonary hypertension. RECENT FINDINGS: SCD-related pulmonary hypertension is defined as a mean pulmonary artery pressure >20 mmHg, a pulmonary artery occlusion pressure <=15 mmHg and relatively low pulmonary vascular resistance (>2 Wood units) rather than the traditional definition of >=3 Wood units, an important distinction due to a baseline high-cardiac output state in the setting of chronic anemia and low vascular resistance. Diastolic dysfunction is frequently identified in this patient population and right heart catheterization is essential to determine if combined pre- and postcapillary pulmonary hypertension is present. Thromboembolism is common among patients with SCD, and screening for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension is essential. Data regarding advanced therapies are limited. Primary treatment options include targeting correction of their primary hemoglobinopathy as well as aggressive management of underlying comorbid conditions. SUMMARY: SCD-related pulmonary hypertension is common among patients with SCD and is associated with increased mortality. A high index of suspicion is warranted during evaluation to identify all potential factors that may be contributing to disease.
36617736	treat|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell	Assessing barriers and facilitators to transition in sickle cell disease care prior to implementation of a formalized program.Over 95% of children with sickle cell disease (SCD) survive into adulthood in the United States. However, early mortality remains a problem, especially in persons between the ages of 18 and 35. One possible explanation for the increased mortality rate in young adults is difficulties in engaging in care during the transition from a heavily contiguous pediatric healthcare model to a more self-reliant adult healthcare model. The goal of this study was to identify potential facilitators and barriers to a successful transfer in care from the pediatric to adult SCD program before the formation of a formal transition program. This is a retrospective cohort study of transition outcomes for 472 individuals with SCD (all genotypes) treated at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) sickle cell clinic (aged 18-24). The primary outcome was whether the patient continued care in (any) adult SCD program (defined as being seen at least once in an adult hematology/SCD clinic). One hundred eighty-eight (45%) transition age patients successfully transferred to adult care. Facilitators to successful transfer in care included being treated at the same hospital for both pediatric and adult programs, having the genotype HbSS, and/or receiving an SCD-modifying therapy at the time of transition (hydroxyurea and/or red cell transfusion therapy). Of primary interest, many of the patients who failed to transition to an adult clinic were lost to follow-up prior to 15 years of age. Importantly, these patients who had previously been labeled as "transition failures," were lost to follow-up long before the transition age. Early engagement is needed for this population.
34965539	treat|@CHEMICAL_Promethazine|@DISEASE_Pain	Clinical Pathway for Vaso-Occlusive Pain Reduces Hospital Admissions.BACKGROUND: Vaso-occlusive pain leads to high acute care utilization among patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Data suggest that clinical pathways (CPWs) reduce variation in the management of vaso-occlusive pain and improve clinical outcomes. METHODS: We implemented and evaluated a CPW for vaso-occlusive pain at our institution using a before and after study design. The primary objective was to decrease acute care utilization among patients with SCD, which was assessed by the primary outcome measures of hospital length of stay (LOS), 30-day readmission rate, and total hospitalizations annually per patient. Secondary outcome measures were packed red blood cell transfusions, and acute chest syndrome incidence. Patient-controlled analgesia use and promethazine use were assessed to estimate CPW use. RESULTS: Three hundred fourty-four admissions in 112 patients were analyzed, of which 193 admissions occurred pre-CPW and 151 admissions occurred post-CPW implementation. Post-CPW implementation, we observed a significant decrease in hospital admissions annually per patient, an increase in patient-controlled analgesia use, and a decrease in intravenous promethazine use. We observed trends toward decreased 30-day readmission rate and increased acute chest syndrome incidence, which were not statistically significant. No effect was found on hospital LOS. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical pathway implementation at our institution reduced variation in management and decreased hospital admissions for vaso-occlusive pain.
37919142		Haematopoietic stem cell health in sickle cell disease and its implications for stem cell therapies and secondary haematological disorders.Gene modification of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is a potentially curative approach to sickle cell disease (SCD) and offers hope for patients who are not eligible for allogeneic HSC transplantation. Current approaches require in vitro manipulation of healthy autologous HSC prior to their transplantation. However, the health and integrity of HSCs may be compromised by a variety of disease processes in SCD, and challenges have emerged in the clinical trials of gene therapy. There is also concern about increased susceptibility to haematological malignancies during long-term follow up of patients, and this raises questions about genomic stability in the stem cell compartment. In this review, we evaluate the evidence for HSC deficits in SCD and then discuss their potential causation. Finally, we suggest several questions which need to be addressed in order to progress with successful HSC manipulation for gene therapy in SCD.
34542932		Influenza vaccination rates and hospitalizations among Medicaid enrollees with and without sickle cell disease, 2009-2015.BACKGROUND: Personswith sickle cell disease (SCD) face increased risks for pulmonary and infection-related complications. This study examines influenza vaccination coverage and estimates influenza-related morbidity among Medicaid enrollees with and without SCD. PROCEDURE: Influenza vaccination coverage and hospitalizations related to influenza and pneumonia/acute chest syndrome (ACS) during each influenza season from 2009-2010 to 2014-2015 were assessed among enrollees in the IBM MarketScan  Multi-State Medicaid Database. Enrollees with SCD were identified as enrollees with greater than or equal to three claims listing SCD within a 5-year period during 2003-2017. Vaccinations were identified in outpatient claims. Hospitalizations associated with influenza or pneumonia/ACS were identified using inpatient claims. This study includes a series of cross-sectional assessments by season. RESULTS: From 2009-2010 through 2014-2015 seasons, the SCD sample ranged from 5044 to 8651 enrollees; the non-SCD sample ranged from 1,841,756 to 3,796,337 enrollees. Influenza vaccination coverage was higher among enrollees with SCD compared with enrollees without SCD for all seasons (24.5%-33.6% and 18.2%-22.0%, respectively). Age-standardized rates of influenza-related hospitalizations were 20-42 times higher among SCD enrollees compared with non-SCD enrollees, and ACS/pneumonia hospitalizations were 18-29 times higher. Among enrollees with SCD, influenza-related hospitalization rates were highest among children aged 0-9 years. Among enrollees without SCD, influenza-related hospitalization rates were highest among adults aged 40-64 years. CONCLUSIONS: Although vaccine coverage was higher in persons with versus without SCD, efforts to increase influenza coverage further are warranted for this high-risk group, who experienced markedly higher rates of influenza and ACS/pneumonia hospitalizations during each season.

The current study investigated HDU- induced hepatic injury and the protective potential of the royal jelly (RJ) against this hepatotoxic effect in the light of hepatic oxidative/ antioxidative status, pro-inflammatory cytokine, apoptosis signaling pathway, and histopathology. Sixty albino rats were used (n = 10/group) for 60 days: control, RJ (100 mg/kg body weight, orally), HDU (225 mg/kg body weight, orally), 2HDU (450 mg/kg body weight, orally), and HDU + RJ groups. HDU-treated rats showed significant elevation of liver function tests as aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase, as well as malondialdehyde and nitric oxide (oxidative biomarkers) and significant decreased hepatic antioxidant molecules (reduced glutathione, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase), compared to a control group, that more pronounced in the high dose of HDU. In addition, HDU induced significant upregulation of TNF-alpha and the Caspase-3 apoptotic pathway. Moreover, the liver of HDU treated groups showed various hepatic lesions from mild to severe necrotic changes related to the HDU dose. However, administration of RJ with HDU improved liver function tests, liver histology, and hepatic oxidative/antioxidative status concerning HDU groups. Furthermore, oral RJ administration with HDU significantly lessens the immune-expression area % of TNF-alpha and Caspase-3. Thus, the royal jelly has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic properties against HDU- induced hepatic injury and could be, therefore, used as adjuvant therapy in patients with long-term HDU medication.
34090531		Genome-based therapeutic interventions for beta-type hemoglobinopathies.For decades, various strategies have been proposed to solve the enigma of hemoglobinopathies, especially severe cases. However, most of them seem to be lagging in terms of effectiveness and safety. So far, the most prevalent and promising treatment options for patients with beta-types hemoglobinopathies, among others, predominantly include drug treatment and gene therapy. Despite the significant improvements of such interventions to the patient's quality of life, a variable response has been demonstrated among different groups of patients and populations. This is essentially due to the complexity of the disease and other genetic factors. In recent years, a more in-depth understanding of the molecular basis of the beta-type hemoglobinopathies has led to significant upgrades to the current technologies, as well as the addition of new ones attempting to elucidate these barriers. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to shed light on pharmacogenomics, gene addition, and genome editing technologies, and consequently, their potential use as direct and indirect genome-based interventions, in different strategies, referring to drug and gene therapy. Furthermore, all the latest progress, updates, and scientific achievements for patients with beta-type hemoglobinopathies will be described in detail.
34285054		Safety of maximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing in individuals with sickle cell disease: a systematic review.OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the safety of maximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) in individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD). Maximal CPET using gas exchange analysis is the gold standard for measuring cardiopulmonary fitness in the laboratory, yet its safety in the SCD population is unclear. DESIGN: Systematic review. DATA SOURCES: Systematic search of Medline (PubMed), EMBASE, Cochrane, ClinicalTrials.gov and professional society websites for all published studies and abstracts through December 2020. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: Two reviewers independently extracted data of interest from studies that assessed safety outcomes of maximal CPET in children and adults with SCD. A modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess for risk of bias in studies included. RESULTS: In total, 24 studies met inclusion/exclusion criteria. Adverse events were reported separately or as part of study results in 36 (3.8%) of 939 participants with SCD undergoing maximal CPET in studies included. Most adverse events were related to transient ischaemic changes on ECG monitoring or oxygen desaturation during testing, which did not result in arrhythmias or other complications. Only 4 (0.43%) of 939 participants experienced pain events due to maximal CPET. CONCLUSION: Maximal CPET appears to be a safe testing modality in children and adults with SCD and can be used to better understand the physiological basis of reduced exercise capacity and guide exercise prescription in this population. Some studies did not focus on reporting adverse events related to exercise testing or failed to mention safety monitoring, which contributed to risk of bias.
33794895	treat|@CHEMICAL_Penicillins|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell	Improvement of SCD morbimortality in children: experience in a remote area of an African country.BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a public health problem in the Democratic Republic of Congo. While reference sickle cell centers have been implemented in capital cities of African countries and have proven to be beneficial for SCD patients. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, they have never been set up in remote areas for families with low or very low sources of income. METHOD: A cohort of 143 children with SCD aged 10 years old (IQR (interquartile range): 6-15 years) (sex ratio male/female = 1.3) were clinically followed for 12 months without any specific intervention aside from the management of acute events, and then for 12 months with a monthly medical visit, biological follow-up, and chemoprophylaxis (folic acid/penicillin), adequate fluids and malaria prevention. RESULTS: The median age of patients at the diagnosis of SCD was 2 years (IQR: 1-5). The implementation of standardized and regular follow-ups in a new sickle cell reference center in a remote city showed an increase in the annual mean hemoglobin level from 50 to 70 g/L (p = 0.001), and a decrease in the lymphocyte count and spleen size (p < 0.001). A significant decrease (p < 0.001) in the average annual number of hospitalizations and episodes of vaso-occlusive crises, blood transfusions, infections, and acute chest syndromes were also observed. CONCLUSIONS: The creation of a sickle cell reference center and the regular follow-up of children with sickle cell disease are possible and applicable in the context of a remote city of an African country and represent simple and accessible measures that can reduce the morbimortality of children with sickle cell disease.
35635234		Accuracy of online medical information: the case of social media in sickle cell disease.The medical needs of individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD) are complex. Patients with SCD experience complications such as recurrent pain episodes and increased hospitalizations. Over 70% of AYA and their parents seek medical information from the Internet; 83% inquire on sites that have interactive/social features, such as Facebook or Twitter, yet accuracy remains unclear. Our objective was to assess the accuracy of the SCD-information posted on social media. We hypothesized that most of the posted information is inaccurate. We coded one month of threads from two common SCD Facebook groups (Sickle Cell Warriors Unity and Sickle Cell Anemia) to identify the purpose of each post and the accuracy of medical information posted. Amongst both social media sites, there were 487 posts. Most of the posts were directed toward socializations (n = 311, 63.8%), while other posts mainly focused mainly on SCD and its management (n = 173, 35.5%). When looking at the medical posts, 44.9% were accurate, whereas 55.1% of the posts included inaccurate information. We found that less than half of the medical information posted on interactive social media is inaccurate. Our findings raise potentially serious implications for individuals with SCD and/or their caregivers who may rely on social media to gather more information about their or their child's disease. Our data highlight the importance of health care providers encouraging patients and parents to ask any questions they may have about SCD, given they may consult social media and Internet site that provide inaccurate information.
34547771	associate|@DISEASE_Bone_Diseases|@GENE_CTSK	Sickle cell disease promotes sex-dependent pathological bone loss through enhanced cathepsin proteolytic activity in mice.Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common hereditary blood disorder in the United States. SCD is frequently associated with osteonecrosis, osteoporosis, osteopenia, and other bone-related complications such as vaso-occlusive pain, ischemic damage, osteomyelitis, and bone marrow hyperplasia known as sickle bone disease (SBD). Previous SBD models have failed to distinguish the age- and sex-specific characteristics of bone morphometry. In this study, we use the Townes mouse model of SCD to assess the pathophysiological complications of SBD in both SCD and sickle cell trait. Changes in bone microarchitecture and bone development were assessed by using high-resolution quantitative micro-computed tomography and the three-dimensional reconstruction of femurs from male and female mice. Our results indicate that SCD causes bone loss and sex-dependent anatomical changes in bone. SCD female mice in particular are prone to trabecular bone loss, whereas cortical bone degradation occurs in both sexes. We also describe the impact of genetic knockdown of cathepsin K- and E-64-mediated cathepsin inhibition on SBD.

It involves HSC mobilization and IV injection of a helper-dependent adenovirus HDAd5/35++ vector system. The current mobilization regimen consists of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) injections over a 4-day period, followed by the administration of plerixafor/AMD3100. We tested a simpler, 2-hour, G-CSF-free mobilization regimen using truncated GRO-beta (MGTA-145; a CXCR2 agonist) and plerixafor in the context of in vivo HSC transduction in mice. The MGTA-145+plerixafor combination resulted in robust mobilization of HSCs. Importantly, compared with G-CSF+plerixafor, MGTA-145+plerixafor led to significantly less leukocytosis and no elevation of serum interleukin-6 levels and was thus likely to be less toxic. With both mobilization regimens, after in vivo selection with O6-benzylguanine (O6BG)/BCNU, stable GFP marking was achieved in >90% of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Genome-wide analysis showed random, multiclonal vector integration. In vivo HSC transduction after mobilization with MGTA-145+plerixafor in a mouse model for thalassemia resulted in >95% human gamma-globin+ erythrocytes at a level of 36% of mouse beta-globin. Phenotypic analyses showed a complete correction of thalassemia. The gamma-globin marking percentage and level were maintained in secondary recipients, further demonstrating that MGTA145+plerixafor mobilizes long-term repopulating HSCs. Our study indicates that brief exposure to MGTA-145+plerixafor may be advantageous as a mobilization regimen for in vivo HSC gene therapy applications across diseases, including thalassemia and sickle cell disease.
33719133		Calibration of T2 oximetry MRI for subjects with sickle cell disease.PURPOSE: Cerebral T2 oximetry is a non-invasive imaging method to measure blood T2 and cerebral venous oxygenation. Measured T2 values are converted to oximetry estimates using carefully validated and potentially disease-specific calibrations. In sickle cell disease, red blood cells have abnormal cell shape and membrane properties that alter T2 oximetry calibration relationships in clinically meaningful ways. Previous in vitro works by two independent groups established potentially competing calibration models. METHODS: This study analyzed pooled datasets from these two studies to establish a unified and more robust sickle-specific calibration to serve as a reference standard in the field. RESULTS: Even though the combined calibration did not demonstrate statistical superiority compared to previous models, the calibration was unbiased compared to blood-gas co-oximetry and yielded limits of agreement of (-10.1%, 11.6%) in non-transfused subjects with sickle cell disease. In transfused patients, this study proposed a simple correction method based on individual hemoglobin S percentage that demonstrated reduced bias in saturation measurement compared to previous uncorrected sickle calibrations. CONCLUSION: The combined calibration is based on a larger range of hematocrit, providing greater confidence in the hematocrit-dependent model parameters, and yielded unbiased estimates to blood-gas co-oximetry measurements from both sites. Additionally, this work also demonstrated the need to correct for transfusion in T2 oximetry measurements for hyper-transfused sickle cell disease patients and proposes a correction method based on patient-specific hemoglobin S concentration.
34548892		Use of herbal medicine by caregivers in the management of children with sickle cell disease in Mulago National Referral Hospital - Uganda.INTRODUCTION: Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is the leading genetic disease in sub-Saharan Africa and therefore remains a global public health threat. Use of complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) most especially herbal medicine (HM) in chronic diseases such as sickle cell disease has widely been reported in Africa where advanced technologies are greatly lacking. Despite a large presence of the sickle cell disease in Uganda, the extent to which herbal medicines are used in management of children with sickle cell disease has not been documented. This study purposed to determine the prevalence of herbal medicine (HM) use and associated factors among caregivers of children with SCD at Mulago National Referral Hospital. METHODS: a total of 384 child caretakers were interviewed in a descriptive cross-sectional quantitative study conducted at the Mulago Sickle cell clinic in March 2019. Enrolment was done consecutively and a structured interviewer administered questionnaire administered to collect data from the caretakers which was managed using SPSS version 23. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify the factors associated with herbal medicine (HM) use. Factors with p-value <0.05 were regarded significant. RESULTS: the rate of herbal use was 77.6% (298 of 384 caregivers). At multivariate analysis, the odds of a caregiver who agreed that; HM cures symptoms faster than conventional medicine (CM) were 3 times those who disagreed with this statement (AOR =3.439, 95% CI: 1.447 - 8.176). The odds that a caregiver who agreed that HM has fewer side effects than CM were almost 4 times those that disagreed with this statement (AOR = 3.528, 95% CI: 1.917 -6.494). The odds that a caregiver who agreed that marketing HM through televisions adverts encourages HM use were 4 times those who disagreed with this statement (AOR = 4.185, 95% CI: 2.036 -8.603). CONCLUSION: this study reports a high prevalence of HM use among caregivers of children with SCD at Mulago Hospital, in Uganda. The practice is significantly influenced by caretakers  perception that HM cures symptoms faster than CM, has fewer side effects and that telemarketing has greatly facilitated its use over CM. More effort is therefore needed to encourage clinic attendances and CM use and limit the unfounded TV adverts on HM. There is also need for studies to identify the common HM used so that their efficacy and safety are well studied.
34686692		Significance of genetic modifiers of hemoglobinopathies leading towards precision medicine.Hemoglobinopathies though a monogenic disorder, show phenotypic variability. Hence, understanding the genetics underlying the heritable sub-phenotypes of hemoglobinopathies, specific to each population, would be prognostically useful and could inform personalized therapeutics. This study aimed to evaluate the role of genetic modifiers leading to higher HbF production with cumulative impact of the modifiers on disease severity. 200 patients (100 beta-thalassemia homozygotes, 100 Sickle Cell Anemia), and 50 healthy controls were recruited. Primary screening followed with molecular analysis for confirming the beta-hemoglobinopathy was performed. Co-existing alpha-thalassemia and the polymorphisms located in 3 genetic loci linked to HbF regulation were screened. The most remarkable result was the association of SNPs with clinically relevant phenotypic groups. The gamma-globin gene promoter polymorphisms [- 158 C   T, + 25 G   A],BCL11A rs1427407 G   T, - 3 bp HBS1L-MYB rs66650371 and rs9399137 T   C polymorphisms were correlated with higher HbF, in group that has lower disease severity score (P < 0.00001), milder clinical presentation, and a significant delay in the age of the first transfusion. Our study emphasizes the complex genetic interactions underlying the disease phenotype that may be a prognostic marker for predicting the clinical severity and assist in disease management.

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is currently the only curative treatment for patients with SCD. Whereas normalization of hemoglobin levels and hemolysis markers has been reported after HSCT, its effects on cerebral perfusion and oxygenation in adult SCD patients remain largely unexplored. This study investigated the effects of HSCT on cerebral blood flow (CBF), oxygen delivery, cerebrovascular reserve (CVR), oxygen extraction fraction (OEF), and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2 ) in 17 adult SCD patients (mean age: 25.0 +- 8.0, 6 females) before and after HSCT and 10 healthy ethnicity-matched controls (mean age: 28.0 +- 8.8, 6 females) using MRI. For the CVR assessment, perfusion scans were performed before and after acetazolamide as a vasodilatory stimulus. Following HSCT, gray and white matter (GM and WM) CBF decreased (p < .01), while GM and WM CVR increased (p < .01) compared with the baseline measures. OEF and CMRO2 also increased towards levels in healthy controls (p < .01). The normalization of cerebral perfusion and oxygen metabolism corresponded with a significant increase in hemoglobin levels and decreases in reticulocytes, total bilirubin, and LDH as markers of hemolysis (p < .01). This study shows that HSCT results in the normalization of cerebral perfusion and oxygen metabolism, even in adult patients with SCD. Future follow-up MRI scans will determine whether the observed normalization of cerebral hemodynamics and oxygen metabolism prevents new silent cerebral infarcts.

METHODS: This is a descriptive study of the profile of sickle cell disease, diagnosed in Mauritania, from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2017, at the outpatient clinics of the National Hospital Center and at the Mauritanian Association for the Support of Sickle Cell Patients. Patients were included following diagnostic confirmation by hemoglobin electrophoresis. RESULTS: During the study period, a total of 135 patients were included (79 female and 56 male), i.e. a sex ratio of 0.7 and an average age of 24 years (extremes: 9 months -77 years). All Mauritanian ethnic groups were affected by sickle cell disease, mainly the Peulths (63.7%). Sickle cell disease was found in eight wilayas, particularly Brakna (39%). The age of diagnosis was between 3 and 5 years, in 48% of patients. Sickle cell disease was discovered at the stage of complications in twelve patients. There are three types of sickle cell phenotypes: SS (54%), AS (40%) and SC (6%). In addition to transfusion, preventive treatment consisted of folic acid (n=53), hydroxyurea (n=14), and long-term antibiotic prophylaxis (n=3). CONCLUSION: The profile of sickle cell disease in Mauritania remains attributed to the lack of an active screening strategy and rapid diagnosis, hence the importance of developing a national program for early detection and management.

These K+ channels are widely expressed in many organs and involved in many pathologies. In particular, Kca3.1 channels have been studied intensively in the context of cancer. They are not only a marker and a valid prognostic tool for cancer patients, but have an important share in driving cancer progression. Their function is required for many characteristic features of the aggressive cancer cell behavior such as migration, invasion and metastasis as well as proliferation and therapy resistance. In the context of cancer, another property of Kca3.1 is now emerging. These channels can be a target for novel small molecule-based imaging probes, as it has been validated in case of fluorescently labeled senicapoc-derivatives. The aim of this review is (i) to give an overview on the role of Kca3.1 channels in cancer progression and in shaping the cancer microenvironment, (ii) discuss the potential of using Kca3.1 targeting drugs for cancer imaging, (iii) and highlight the possibility of combining molecular dynamics simulations to image inhibitor binding to Kca3.1 channels in order to provide a deeper understanding of Kca3.1 channel pharmacology. Alltogether, Kca3.1 is an attractive therapeutic target so that senicapoc, originally developed for the treatment of sickle cell anemia, should be repurposed for the treatment of cancer patients.
36329651		Brain volume in Tanzanian children with sickle cell anaemia: A neuroimaging study.Brain injury is a common complication of sickle cell anaemia (SCA). White matter (WM) and cortical and subcortical grey matter (GM), structures may have reduced volume in patients with SCA. This study focuses on whether silent cerebral infarction (SCI), vasculopathy or anaemia affects WM and regional GM volumes in children living in Africa. Children with SCA (n = 144; aged 5-20 years; 74 male) and sibling controls (n = 53; aged 5-17 years; 29 male) underwent magnetic resonance imaging. Effects of SCI (n = 37), vasculopathy (n = 15), and haemoglobin were assessed. Compared with controls, after adjusting for age, sex and intracranial volume, patients with SCA had smaller volumes for WM and cortical, subcortical and total GM, as well as bilateral cerebellar cortex, globus pallidus, amygdala and right thalamus. Left globus pallidus volume was further reduced in patients with vasculopathy. Putamen and hippocampus volumes were larger in patients with SCA without SCI or vasculopathy than in controls. Significant positive effects of haemoglobin on regional GM volumes were confined to the controls. Patients with SCA generally have reduced GM volumes compared with controls, although some subcortical regions may be spared. SCI and vasculopathy may affect the trajectory of change in subcortical GM and WM volume. Brain volume in non-SCA children may be vulnerable to contemporaneous anaemia.
38237001		Perspectives of Adolescents and Young Adults With Sickle Cell Disease and Clinicians on Improving Transition Readiness With a Video Game Intervention.We aimed to learn the experiences of clinicians and adolescents and young adults with sickle cell disease (AYA-SCD) with managing their disease at home and making medical decisions as they transition from pediatric to adult care, and their perceptions of a video game intervention to positively impact these skills. We conducted individual, semistructured interviews with patients (AYA-SCD ages 15 to 26 years) and clinicians who provide care to AYA-SCD at an urban, quaternary-care hospital. Interviews elicited patients' and clinicians' experiences with AYA-SCD, barriers and facilitators to successful home management, and their perspectives on shared decision-making and a video game intervention. To identify themes, we conducted an inductive analysis until data saturation was reached. Participants (16 patients and 21 clinicians) identified 4 main themes: (1) self-efficacy as a critical skill for a successful transition from pediatric to adult care, (2) the importance of patient engagement in making medical decisions, (3) multilevel determinants of optimal self-efficacy and patient engagement, and (4) support for a video game intervention which, by targeting potential determinants of AYA-SCD achieving optimal self-efficacy and engagement in decision-making, may improve these important skills.
34548040		Diagnosis patterns of sickle cell disease in Ghana: a secondary analysis.BACKGROUND: Despite having the highest prevalence of sickle cell disease (SCD) in the world, no country in Sub-Saharan Africa has a universal screening program for the disease. We sought to capture the diagnosis patterns of SCD (age at SCD diagnosis, method of SCD diagnosis, and age of first pain crisis) in Accra, Ghana. METHODS: We administered an in-person, voluntary survey to parents of offspring with SCD between 2009 and 2013 in Accra as a part of a larger study and conducted a secondary data analysis to determine diagnosis patterns. This was conducted at a single site: a large academic medical center in the region. Univariate analyses were performed on diagnosis patterns; bivariate analyses were conducted to determine whether patterns differed by participant's age (children: those < 18 years old whose parents completed a survey about them, compared to adults: those > = 18 years old whose parents completed a survey about them), or their disease severity based on SCD genotype. Pearson's chi-squared were calculated. RESULTS: Data was collected on 354 unique participants from parents. Few were diagnosed via SCD testing in the newborn period. Only 44% were diagnosed with SCD by age four; 46% had experienced a pain crisis by the same age. Most (66%) were diagnosed during pain crisis, either in acute (49%) or primary care (17%) settings. Children were diagnosed with SCD at an earlier age (74% by four years old); among the adults, parents reflected that 30% were diagnosed by four years old (p < 0.001). Half with severe forms of SCD were diagnosed by age four, compared to 31% with mild forms of the disease (p = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: The lack of a robust newborn screening program for SCD in Accra, Ghana, leaves children at risk for disease complications and death. People in our sample were diagnosed with SCD in the acute care setting, and in their toddler or school-age years or thereafter, meaning they are likely being excluded from important preventive care. Understanding current SCD diagnosis patterns in the region can inform efforts to improve the timeliness of SCD diagnosis, and improve the mortality and morbidity caused by the disease in this high prevalence population.

Despite its claimed benefits, there has been a lack of research on the findings of current clinical trials (CTs) that investigated its efficacy in the treatment of various medical diseases. The aim of this systematic review was to study CTs which focused on GA and its possible use in the management of various medical diseases. A search of the extant literature was performed in the PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane databases to retrieve CTs focusing on evidence-based clinical indications. The databases were searched using the keywords ("Gum Arabic" OR "Acacia senegal" OR "Acacia seyal" OR "Gum Acacia" OR "Acacia Arabica") AND ("Clinical Trial" OR "Randomized Controlled Trial" OR "Randomized Clinical Trial"). While performing the systematic review, data were obtained on the following parameters: title, authors, date of publication, study design, study aim, sample size, type of intervention used, targeted medical diseases, and main findings. Twenty-nine papers were included in this systematic review. The results showed that ingestion of GA altered lipid profiles, renal profiles, plaque, gingival scores, biochemical parameters, blood pressure, inflammatory markers, and adiposity. GA exhibited anti-inflammatory, prebiotic, and antibacterial properties. GA has been successfully used to treat sickle cell anemia, rheumatoid arthritis, metabolic disorders, periodontitis, gastrointestinal conditions, and kidney diseases. Herein, we discuss GA with respect to the underlying mechanisms involved in each medical disease, thereby justifying GA's future role as a therapeutic agent.

SCD is caused by a point mutation (20A > T) in the beta-globin gene. Since SCD is the most common single-gene disorder, curing SCD is a primary goal in HSC gene therapy. beta-thalassemia results from either the absence or the reduction of beta-globin expression, and it can be cured using similar strategies. In HSC gene-addition therapy, patient CD34+ HSCs are genetically modified by adding a therapeutic beta-globin gene with lentiviral transduction, followed by autologous transplantation. Alternatively, novel gene-editing therapies allow for the correction of the mutated beta-globin gene, instead of addition. Furthermore, these diseases can be cured by gamma-globin induction based on gene addition/editing in HSCs. In this review, we discuss HSC-targeted gene therapy in SCD with gene addition as well as gene editing.

METHODS: Included are 1,096 transplants for sickle cell disease between 1991 and 2016. There were 22 secondary neoplasms. Types included leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS; n = 15) and solid tumor (n = 7). Fine-Gray regression models examined for risk factors for leukemia/MDS and any secondary neoplasm. RESULTS: The 10-year incidence of leukemia/MDS was 1.7% (95% CI, 0.90 to 2.9) and of any secondary neoplasm was 2.4% (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.8). After adjusting for other risk factors, risks for leukemia/MDS (hazard ratio, 22.69; 95% CI, 4.34 to 118.66; P = .0002) or any secondary neoplasm (hazard ratio, 7.78; 95% CI, 2.20 to 27.53; P = .0015) were higher with low-intensity (nonmyeloablative) regimens compared with more intense regimens. All low-intensity regimens included total-body irradiation (TBI 300 or 400 cGy with alemtuzumab, TBI 300 or 400 cGy with cyclophosphamide, TBI 200, 300, or 400 cGy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, or TBI 200 cGy with fludarabine). None of the patients receiving myeloablative and only 23% of those receiving reduced-intensity regimens received TBI. CONCLUSION: Low-intensity regimens rely on tolerance induction and establishment of mixed-donor chimerism. Persistence of host cells exposed to low-dose radiation triggering myeloid malignancy is one plausible etiology. Pre-existing myeloid mutations and prior inflammation may also contribute but could not be studied using our data source. Choosing conditioning regimens likely to result in full-donor chimerism may in part mitigate the higher risk for leukemia/MDS.
36377544		Red blood cell alloimmunisation in sickle cell disease patients in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of red blood cell (RBC) alloimmunisation and alloantibody specificity in sickle cell disease (SCD) patients in Kisangani, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in comparison with those followed at the Centre Hospitalier Regional (CHR) de la Citadelle of Liege (Belgium). BACKGROUND: Data regarding RBC alloimmunisation (immune response of the organism to foreign erythrocyte antigens, antigens that lack on its own RBC) in SCD patients are scarce in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: We conducted a multi-site-based cross-sectional study among 125 SCD patients at Kisangani and 136 at the CHR de la Citadelle of Liege. The diagnosis of SCD was confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Alloantibodies were screened using the agglutination technique on gel cards and their specificity determined using 11 and/or 16 cell panels. Statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS. RESULTS: The prevalence of RBC alloimmunisation was 9.6% among SCD patients in Kisangani versus 22.8% in those of Liege. At Kisangani as well as at Liege, the median age of alloimmunised patients was higher than that of non-alloimmunised patients, 15.5 years (IQR:4.8-19.8) and 24 years (IQR:14-31) versus 10 years (IQR: 6.5-17) and 17 years (IQR:12-24), respectively. The median number of blood units was higher in both Kisangani and Liege immunised patients compared to non-immunised patients, 8 (IQR:5-11) versus 5 (IQR:3-13) and 41(IQR:6-93) versus 6.5(3-37) respectively. At Kisangani (N = 14), the most frequent antibodies were anti-D (28.6%) and anti-C versus anti-E (13.6%), anti-S (13.6%) and anti-Lea (11.4%) at Liege (N = 44). CONCLUSIONS: These findings stated that alloimmunisation is a common complication in SCD patients in the DRC. In the resource-limited setting of this country, blood transfusion with minimal ABO, D, C and E antigen matching in addition to the use of compatibility test could significantly reduce the incidence of this complication.

Major conventional stroke risk factors are absent in most individuals with SCD, yet nearly 50% have evidence of brain infarcts by the age of 30 years, indicating alternative etiologies for ischemia. We investigated whether radiological evidence of accelerated blood water transit through capillaries, visible on arterial spin labeling (ASL) magnetic resonance imaging, reduces following transfusion-induced increases in hemoglobin and relates to oxygen extraction fraction (OEF). Neurological evaluation along with anatomical and hemodynamic imaging with cerebral blood flow (CBF)-weighted pseudocontinuous ASL and OEF imaging with T2 -relaxation-under-spin-tagging were applied in sequence before and after blood transfusion therapy (n = 32) and in a comparator cohort of nontransfused SCD participants on hydroxyurea therapy scanned at two time points to assess stability without interim intervention (n = 13). OEF was calculated separately using models derived from human hemoglobin-F, hemoglobin-A, and hemoglobin-S. Gray matter CBF and dural sinus signal, indicative of rapid blood transit, were evaluated at each time point and compared with OEF using paired statistical tests (significance: two-sided p < 0.05). No significant change in sinus signal was observed in nontransfused participants (p = 0.650), but a reduction was observed in transfused participants (p = 0.034), consistent with slower red cell transit following transfusion. The dural sinus signal intensity was inversely associated with OEF pretransfusion (p = 0.011), but not posttransfusion. Study findings suggest that transfusion-induced increases in total hemoglobin may lengthen blood transit times through cerebral capillaries and alter cerebral OEF in SCD.
34083624		Hemodynamic and biological correlates of glomerular hyperfiltration in sickle cell patients before and under renin-angiotensin system blocker.Glomerular hyperfiltration alone or associated with albuminuria is a well-known feature of sickle cell associated nephropathy. Though, glomerular hyperfiltration is currently considered to be related to a high renal plasma flow and chronic hemolysis, cardiac output influence on measured glomerular filtration rate (mGFR) have not been investigated so far. Thirty seven homozygous sickle cell patients (SCA) from the RAND study investigated before and under angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) were included. Both mGFR and cardiac index (CI) were high (> 110 ml/min/1.73 m2 and > 3.5 l/m2 in 81% and 97% of cases) with low systemic vascular resistance (SVR) (< 700 dynes/s/cm-5) in 38% of cases. mGFR association with CI and SVR were significant at baseline (respectively rho: 0.44, p = 0.008 and rho: - 0.37, p = 0.02) and under ACEI (p = 0.007 and 0.01 respectively), in accordance with previous data showing that hyperfiltration was linked to an increased glomerular perfusion and a glomerulomegaly rather than increased capillary hydrostatic pressure. Of notice, after adjustment on CI, mGFR remained associated with reticulocyte count and albuminuria under ACEI (p = 0.006 and 0.02 respectively). Our results suggest that hyperfiltration is tightly linked to an increased cardiac output which may account for an increased renal blood flow. Chronic hemolysis could be a relevant factor accounting for hyperfiltration potentially acting on glomerular enlargement which appears as a key factor. Our data suggest that cardiac output assessment is a relevant tool in the routine management and monitoring of SCA nephropathy.
37235738		Transfusion in hemoglobinopathies and red blood cell alloimmunization: data from Sicily, Sardinia and Malta.BACKGROUND: Hemoglobinopathies are a group of diseases that include those due to globin gene mutations, such as thalassemia major (TM) and thalassemia intermedia (TI) or due to alteration of hemoglobin structure such as sickle cell disease (SCD), as well as a combination of these conditions such as thalasso-drepanocytosis (TD). They constitute the most frequent hereditary anemias requiring blood transfusion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In April 2022, a questionnaire was sent to the Transfusion Services (TS) of Sicily, Sardinia and the Maltese National Blood Transfusion (MNBT) service. The questionnaire was divided into a generic part including the number of patients followed and the type of hemoglobinopathy, and a section relating to transfusion therapy, including the number of units transfused, whether red blood cells (RBC) were washed and, finally, a section relating to the presence or absence of alloantibodies and their identification. RESULTS: Data was retrieved for 2,574 patients: 68.6% TM, 15.4% TI, 10.3% TD, 4.1% SCD, and 1.6% other hemoglobinopathies (OHA). The number of RBC units transfused was 76,974, equivalent to 24.5% of all the RBCU transfused from the total number of patients followed. The number of washed RBCU was 21.1% of all the units used; 337 patients (37%) were diagnosed with alloantibodies, the majority of which were patients with SCD (20.6%). Of the 485 alloantibodies found, 90.3% were identified. The antibodies found most frequently were related to the Kell system (41.7%) followed by antibodies to the Rhesus system (37.9%); 29.7% of patients had more than one antibody. DISCUSSION: From our study, certain indications can be formulated: 1) complete the National Registry for patients with hemoglobinopathies; 2) create a Registry of alloimmunized patients to ensure transfusion therapy is as safe as possible, considering antibody evanescence; and 3) increase the recruitment of blood donors of diverse ethnicities.

36592159		Correctly Establishing and Interpreting Oxygenation Status in Sickle Cell Disease.BACKGROUND: As hypoxemia and hypoxia are central elements of disease pathophysiology and disease-related morbidity and mortality in individuals affected by sickle cell disease (SCD), clinical management aims to optimize oxygenation. CONTENT: Hypoxemia is primarily screened for with pulse oximetry. However, in SCD pulse oximetry can inaccurately reflect arterial saturation, posing the risk of undetected (occult) hypoxemia. Solely relying on pulse oximetry might therefore lead to misdiagnosis or mismanagement, with devastating effects on tissue oxygenation. The interpretation of oxygenation status is multifaceted, and "oxygen saturation" is often used as an umbrella term to refer to distinctly different measured quantities-estimated oxygen saturation (O2Sat), hemoglobin oxygen saturation (SO2) by either pulse oximetry or co-oximetry, and fractional oxyhemoglobin (FO2Hb). While in many clinical situations this ambiguous use is of little consequence, O2Sat, SO2, and FO2Hb cannot be used interchangeably in the setting of SCD, as dyshemoglobins, anemia, cardiopulmonary comorbidities, concomitant medications, and frequent transfusions need to be accounted for. This article describes the parameters that determine blood and tissue oxygen concentration, discusses laboratory method performance characteristics and the correct interpretation of currently available clinical laboratory testing, and reviews the literature on noninvasive vs invasive oxygenation measurements in SCD. SUMMARY: By correctly establishing and interpreting oxygenation parameters, clinical and laboratory teams can ensure high-quality, equitable healthcare, counteracting systemic exacerbations of health disparities frequently experienced by individuals with SCD.
37800996		Outcomes and long-term effects of hematopoietic stem cell transplant in sickle cell disease.INTRODUCTION: Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is the only readily available curative option for sickle cell disease (SCD). Cure rates following human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched related donor HSCT with myeloablative or non-myeloablative conditioning are > 90%. Alternative donor sources, including haploidentical donor and autologous with gene therapy, expand donor options but are limited by inferior outcomes, limited data, and/or shorter follow-up and therefore remain experimental. AREAS COVERED: Outcomes are improving with time, with donor type and conditioning regimens having the greatest impact on long-term complications. Patients with stable donor engraftment do not experience SCD-related symptoms and have stabilization or improvement of end-organ pathology; however, the long-term effects of curative strategies remain to be fully established and have significant implications in a patient's decision to seek therapy. This review covers currently published literature on HSCT outcomes, including organ-specific outcomes implicated in SCD, as well as long-term effects. EXPERT OPINION: HSCT, both allogeneic and autologous gene therapy, in the SCD population reverses the sickle phenotype, prevents further organ damage, can resolve prior organ dysfunction in both pediatric and adult patients. Data support greater success with HSCT at a younger age, thus, curative therapies should be discussed early in the patient's life.
34286896		Transition care continuity promotes long-term retention in adult care among young adults with sickle cell disease.BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Care continuity prevents increased health care utilization and mortality during transition from pediatric to adult care. Our program employs a co-located care delivery model, in which pediatric provider involvement continues during young adulthood. We tested the hypothesis that individuals who participated in the co-located model have greater retention in adult care compared to those who only received pediatric transition services. METHODS: This study consisted of 311 youth with SCD (51.4% male; 63.0% HbSS/HbSbeta0 -thalassemia) who transferred to adult care from 2007 to 2017. Retention was defined as continuation with an adult provider for >=12 or >=24 months post-pediatric care. Logistic regression estimated the association between co-location status and retention at 12 and 24 months. Logistic regression and t-tests were used to evaluate potential predictors of retention in adult care. RESULTS: Individuals who participated in the co-location model were 1.9 times more likely to remain in adult care 12 (95% CI: 1.01, 3.47) and 24 (95% CI: 1.01, 3.70) months post-pediatric care compared to those who did not participate. Individuals with HbSS/HbSbeta0 -thalassemia were 1.9 times more likely to be retained at 12 months compared to those with HbSC/HbSbeta+ -thalassemia/HbS/HPFH (95% CI: 1.12, 3.09). For every clinic encounter in the last 2 years of pediatric care, the odds of being retained at least 24 months after initiating adult care increased 1.1 times (95% CI: 1.02, 1.13). CONCLUSIONS: Continuity of providers from pediatric to adult care may increase long-term retention in adult care. Longitudinal monitoring of adult outcomes is critical to identifying the efficacy of transition services.
35318744		Preventing antibody positive delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions in sickle cell disease: Lessons learned from a case.INTRODUCTION: Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions are important in the management of patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). However, a potentially catastrophic complication of transfusion in this population is the delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction (DHTR). The pathophysiology of all DHTRs is not understood, but some are known to be caused by an anamnestic resurgence of RBC alloantibodies. CASE PRESENTATION: A child with SCD transfused for acute chest syndrome re-presented a week after hospital discharge with severe anaemia, hemolysis, and a newly detected anti-E. This patient had been previously transfused years ago at an outside institution and the anti-E had not been previously documented. DISCUSSION: The presented case of an antibody positive DHTR illustrates several concepts critical to the prevention of this complication. RBC alloantibodies must be detected and this information must be shared. Prophylactic C/c, E/e, K antigen matching is helpful for patients with SCD, but systems must be in place to identify these patients. Patients transfused at multiple different hospitals are especially at risk for this complication and efforts are needed to prevent them from suffering a DHTR.

35110690		Significant improvement of child physical and emotional functioning after familial haploidentical stem cell transplant.Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (AlloSCT) represents the only curative therapy for sickle cell disease (SCD). However, limited availability of matched related donors and suboptimal outcomes following AlloSCT with unrelated donors has led to investigation of alternative donors. Among children with high-risk SCD, we evaluated health-related quality of life (HRQoL) impact in the two years following familial haploidentical SCT. HRQoL was collected from parent and child raters, using the Child Health Ratings Inventories Generic measure and haploidentical SCT-specific module. Repeated measures models were fit to assess HRQoL changes over time and by rater. Nineteen children (mean age 12.9 yrs [standard deviation, 5.3]; 63% male) and their parents were included. There were no differences in the 2-yr trajectories of child physical or emotional functioning (EF) by rater. Child physical functioning and EF scores were significantly lower at day +45 than baseline, but scores recovered by day +180. There was significant improvement in EF (p = 0.03) at 2 yrs vs baseline. A similar pattern of scores over time was seen for parent ratings of child's global HRQoL. Despite treatment intensity in the initial months following AlloSCT, patient scores recovered or exceeded baseline scores at two years. This trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01461837).
35020514		Evolving Strategies in the Management of Sickle Cell Disease in the 21st Century and the Role of the Pediatrician.Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the most common genetic disorders in the United States. Once a fatal disease of childhood, the majority of patients born with SCD who live in a developed country will survive to adulthood (albeit with slightly shortened life spans). Despite numerous novel therapeutic advancements in recent years that serve to mitigate the symptoms associated with SCD, the only cure for SCD is a hematopoietic stem cell transplant. The overall survival for patients with a matched sibling donor transplant is greater than 90%. However, fewer than 20% of patients with SCD in the US have a 12/12 human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched sibling donor. In contrast, most patients have at least one HLA haploidentical first-degree relative, which expands the donor pool for patients who have diseases amenable to stem cell transplantation such as SCD. [Pediatr Ann. 2022;51(1):e34-e39.].
35217803		Hemoglobinopathy prevention in primary care: a reflection of underdetection and difficulties with accessibility of medical care, a quantitative study.As in most Northern European countries, the prevalence of hemoglobinopathies in The Netherlands is increasing due to migration. Although hemoglobinopathies are severe chronic diseases with few treatment options, timely detection of carriers allows at-risk couples to make informed reproductive choices such as pre-implantation diagnosis, prenatal diagnosis or termination of affected pregnancies. Using a quantitative design, we evaluated the prevalence of hemoglobinopathies in The Hague region, The Netherlands. Patient and carrier registries from hospital, laboratory and general practitioners allowed this quantitative analysis. The highest prevalence of hemoglobinopathies was seen in immigrant neighborhoods, and a large gap was noted between estimated carrier prevalence and the actual registration of carriers in electronic patient records. Carrier prevalence was estimated to be 13,704; however, the ELAN database contains only 1542 cases with ICPC codes for sickle cell disease or thalassemia. Although more research is needed to define the requirements of the healthcare system to address this challenge, this study clearly shows the gap between estimated carrier prevalence and registration and thereby the pressing need for action.

Inactivation via genome editing of gamma-globin developmental suppressors, such as BCL11A or LRF/ZBTB7A, or of their binding sites, have been shown to significantly increase expression of endogenous HbF. To broaden the therapeutic window beyond a single-editing approach, we have explored combinations of cis- and trans-editing targets to enhance HbF reactivation. Multiplex mutagenesis in adult CD34+ cells was well tolerated and did not lead to any detectable defect in the cells' proliferation and differentiation, either in vitro or in vivo. The combination of 1 trans and 1 cis mutation resulted in high editing retention in vivo, coupled with almost pancellular HbF expression in NBSGW mice. The greater in vivo performance of this combination was also recapitulated using a novel helper-dependent adenoviral-CRISPR vector (HD-Ad-dualCRISPR) in CD34+ cells from beta-thalassemia patients transplanted to NBSGW mice. A pronounced increase in HbF expression was observed in human red blood cells in mice with established predominant beta0/beta0-thalassemic hemopoiesis after in vivo injection of the HD-Ad-dualCRISPR vector. Collectively, our data suggest that the combination of cis and trans fetal globin reactivation mutations has the potential to significantly increase HbF both totally and on a per cell basis over single editing and could thus provide significant clinical benefit to patients with severe beta-globin phenotype.
34963615		Combined preoperative plasma exchange and red blood cell exchange transfusion in a renal transplant patient with protein S deficiency and hemoglobin SC disease.BACKGROUND: Protein S deficiency is associated with increased risk of venous thromboembolism, complicating the perioperative management of such patients. We present a patient with sickle cell disease (Hb SC genotype) and inherited protein S deficiency who underwent a living-donor renal transplant. To minimize thrombotic risk and sickle cell complications, both plasma exchange and red blood cell (RBC) exchange transfusion were performed pre-operatively. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Plasma exchange was utilized to increase protein S levels and to reduce the risk of post-operative venous thromboembolism, including allograft thrombosis, while RBC exchange was performed to reduce the risk of acute post-operative sickle cell disease complications. RESULTS: With the use of combined pre-operative plasma exchange and RBC exchange transfusion, this patient with protein S deficiency and Hb SC underwent a successful renal transplant without acute sickle cell complications or thrombotic complications. CONCLUSIONS: This case demonstrates the potential use of pre-operative plasma exchange in patients with protein S deficiency undergoing high thrombotic risk procedures.
33749717		A Budget Impact Analysis of Gene Therapy for Sickle Cell Disease: The Medicaid Perspective.Importance: Hundreds of gene therapies are undergoing clinical testing and are likely to be priced more than $1 million per course of treatment. The association that high prices will have with insurance coverage of gene therapy remains unclear. Gene therapy for sickle cell disease has shown early success and would be one of the first gene therapies available for a relatively large population. Objectives: To estimate the budget impact and affordability of a gene therapy for severe sickle cell disease from the perspective of US Medicaid programs with the highest prevalence of sickle cell disease while exploring the impact of an annuity payment model. Design, Setting, and Participants: A budget impact analysis was performed from January 1 to May 31, 2020, for a sickle cell disease gene therapy from the perspective of 10 state Medicaid plans with a 5-year time horizon, using state-level disease prevalence data from 2012. Disease prevalence, Medicaid enrollment, and expenditures were derived from the available literature. The eligible population was based on modified clinical trial inclusion criteria including individuals aged 13 to 45 years with severe disease. Exposures: The gene therapy was assumed to be administered to 7% of the eligible population annually and was curative (no subsequent disease-related expenditures). The gene therapy price was $1.85 million in the base case, and baseline disease-related expenditures were $42 200 per year. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcomes were total budget impact and budget impact per member per month in years 1 through 5. One-way sensitivity analysis was used to evaluate uncertainty of market diffusion, size of eligible population, price of therapy, and cost of routine care. Results: An estimated 5464 Medicaid enrollees would be eligible for the gene therapy nationally, with 2315 individuals in the 10 Medicaid programs of interest (16 per 100 000 enrollees). The model projected a mean 1-year budget impact of $29.96 million per state Medicaid program in the sample ($1.91 per member per month). A 5-year annuity payment reduced the short-term budget impact. Conclusions and Relevance: This study suggests that a gene therapy for severe sickle cell disease is likely to produce a considerable budget impact for many Medicaid plans while potentially offering substantial benefit to patients. Payers may need to take steps to ensure affordability and access. Gene therapy for sickle cell disease is likely to provide an early demonstration of the unique financial challenges associated with this emerging drug class.

In this study, GBT1118, an allosteric modifier of Hb affinity for O2, was used to assess the impact of increasing Hb affinity for O2 on brain tissue oxygenation, blood pressure, heart rate, O2 delivery, and tolerance to hypoxia in Townes transgenic sickle cell disease (SCD) mice. Brain oxygenation and O2 delivery were studied during normoxia and severe hypoxic challenges. Chronic treatment with GBT1118 increased Hb affinity for O2, reducing the Po2 for 50% HbO2 saturation (P50) in SCD mice from 31 mmHg to 18 mmHg. This treatment significantly reduced anemia, increasing hematocrit by 33%, improved cardiac output (CO), and O2 delivery and extraction. Chronically increasing Hb affinity for O2 with GBT1118 preserved cortical O2 tension during normoxia, improved cortical O2 tension during hypoxia, and increased tolerance to severe hypoxia in SCD mice. Independent of hematological changes induced by chronic treatment, a single dose of GBT1118 significantly improved tolerance to hypoxia, highlighting the benefits of increasing Hb affinity for O2 and consequently reducing sickling of RBCs in blood during hypoxia in SCD.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Chronic pharmacologically increased hemoglobin affinity for oxygen in sickle cell disease mice alleviated hematological consequences of sickle cell disease, increasing RBC half-life, hematocrit, and hemoglobin concentration, while also decreasing reticulocyte count. Additionally, chronically increased hemoglobin affinity for oxygen significantly improved survival as well as cortical tissue oxygenation in sickle cell disease mice during hypoxia, suggesting that oxygen delivery and utilization is improved by increased hemoglobin affinity for oxygen.
34528246		What is the role of chest X-ray imaging in the acute management of children with sickle cell disease?Children with sickle cell disease (SCD) frequently present to hospital acutely unwell and are often exposed to diagnostic chest X-rays (CXRs). Little evidence exists to determine when CXRs are clinically useful. Using electronic hospital records, we audited CXR use in children aged 0-18 who presented to hospital over the past 10 years in both an inpatient and emergency department setting. From a total of 915 first CXRs, only 28 2% of CXRs (n = 258) had clinically significant findings that altered management or final diagnosis. Of these abnormalities, consolidation represented 52 3%, effusion 8 9%, cardiomegaly 8 4% and sickle cell-related bone changes 6 3%. Indications for CXR of respiratory distress (OR = 3 74, 95% CI 2 28-6 13), hypoxia (OR = 1 86, 95% CI 1 50-2 31) and cough (OR = 1 64, 95% CI 1 33-2 02), were more likely to have significant CXR findings. Patients who had higher peak fever (38 4 C vs. 37 4 C, P = 0 001), higher peak CRP (156 4 vs. 46 1, P < 0 001) and higher WCC (20 2 vs. 13 6, P < 0 001) were more likely to have clinically significant abnormalities on CXR. We found a decision tool using either hypoxia, cough, respiratory distress, T > 38 C, CRP > 50 or WCC > 15 x 109 /l as indications for CXR, to have a sensitivity of 88% (with 95% CI 0 78-0 95) and specificity of 46% (95% CI 0 43-0 50) for clinically significant findings.
36040789		Characterizing User Engagement With a Digital Intervention for Pain Self-management Among Youth With Sickle Cell Disease and Their Caregivers: Subanalysis of a Randomized Controlled Trial.BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is characterized by severe acute pain episodes as well as risk for chronic pain. Digital delivery of SCD pain self-management support may enhance pain self-management skills and accessibility for youth. However, little is known about how youth with SCD and their caregivers engage with digital health programs. iCanCope with pain is a digital pain self-management platform adapted for youth with SCD and caregivers through a user-centered design approach. The program was delivered via a website (separate versions for youth and caregiver) and mobile app (youth only). OBJECTIVE: We aimed to characterize patterns of user engagement with the iCanCope with SCD program among youth with SCD and their caregivers. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was completed across multiple North American SCD clinics. Eligible youth were aged 12-18 years, diagnosed with SCD, English-speaking, and experiencing moderate-to-severe pain interference. Eligible caregivers were English-speaking with a child enrolled in the study. Dyads were randomized to receive the iCanCope intervention or attention-control education for 8-12 weeks. This report focused on engagement among dyads who received the intervention. User-level analytics were captured. Individual interviews were conducted with 20% of dyads. Descriptive statistics characterized quantitative engagement. Content analysis summarized qualitative interview data. Exploratory analysis tested the hypothesis that caregiver engagement would be positively associated with child engagement. RESULTS: The cohort included primarily female (60% [34/57] of youth; 91% [49/56] of caregivers) and Black (>90% of youth [53/57] and caregivers [50/56]) participants. Among 56 dyads given program access, differential usage patterns were observed: both the youth and caregiver engaged (16/56, 29%), only the youth engaged (24/56, 43%), only the caregiver engaged (1/56, 2%), and neither individual engaged (16/56, 29%). While most youth engaged with the program (40/57, 70%), most caregivers did not (39/56, 70%). Youth were more likely to engage with the app than the website (85% [34/57] versus 68% [23/57]), and the most popular content categories were goal setting, program introduction, and symptom history. Among caregivers, program introduction, behavioral plans, and goal setting were the most popular content areas. As hypothesized, there was a moderate positive association between caregiver and child engagement (chi21=6.6; P=.01; phi=0.34). Interviews revealed that most dyads would continue to use the program (11/12, 92%) and recommend it to others (10/12, 83%). The reasons for app versus website preference among youth were ease of use, acceptable time commitment, and interactivity. Barriers to caregiver engagement included high time burden and limited perceived relevance of content. CONCLUSIONS: This is one of the first studies to apply digital health analytics to characterize patterns of engagement with SCD self-management among youth and caregivers. The findings will be used to optimize the iCanCope with SCD program prior to release. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03201874; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03201874.
36635153		CRISPR-Cas9 base editors and their current role in human therapeutics.BACKGROUND: Consistent progress has been made to create more efficient and useful CRISPR-Cas9-based molecular toolsfor genomic modification. METHODS: This review focuses on recent articles that have employed base editors (BEs) for both clinical and research purposes. RESULTS: CRISPR-Cas9 BEs are a useful system because of their highefficiency and broad applicability to gene correction and disruption. In addition, base editing has beensuggested as a safer approach than other CRISPR-Cas9-based systems, as it limits double-strand breaksduring multiplex gene knockout and does not require a toxic DNA donor molecule for genetic correction. CONCLUSION: As such, numerous industry and academic groups are currently developing base editing strategies withclinical applications in cancer immunotherapy and gene therapy, which this review will discuss, with a focuson current and future applications of in vivo BE delivery.
36038392		Development of a Flow Phantom for Transcranial Doppler Ultrasound Quality Assurance.Anecdotal evidence was recently brought to our attention suggesting a potential difference in velocity estimates between transcranial Doppler (TCD) systems when measuring high velocities (~200 cm/s) close to the threshold for sickle cell disease stroke prevention. As we were unable to identify a suitable commercial TCD phantom, a middle cerebral artery (MCA) flow phantom was developed to evaluate velocity estimates from different devices under controlled conditions. Time-averaged velocity estimates were obtained using two TCD devices: a Spencer Technologies ST3 Doppler system (ST3 PMD150, Spencer Technologies, Seattle, WA, USA) and a DWL Dopplerbox (DWL Compumedics, SN-300947, Singen, Germany). These were compared with velocity estimates obtained using a Zonare duplex scanner (Zonare Medical Systems, Mountain View, CA, USA), with timed collection of fluid as the gold standard. Bland-Altman analysis was performed to compare measurements between devices. Our tests confirmed that velocities measured with the DWL TCD system were +4.1 cm/s (+3.7%; limits of agreement [LoA]: 2%, 5%; p = 0.03) higher than the Spencer system when measuring a velocity 110 cm/s and +12 cm/s higher (+5.7 %; LoA: 4.8%, 6.6%; p = 0.03) when measuring velocities of 210 cm/s, close to the diagnostic threshold for stroke intervention. We found our MCA phantom to be a valuable tool for systematically quantifying differences in TCD velocity estimates between devices, confirming that the DWL system gave consistently higher readings than the Spencer ST3 system. Differences become more pronounced at high velocities, which explains why they were not identified earlier. Our findings have clinical implications for centers using TCD to monitor patients with sickle cell disease, as extra care may be needed to adjust for bias between manufacturers when making treatment decisions about children with sickle cell with velocities close to the diagnostic threshold.

34626431	treat|@CHEMICAL_Sildenafil_Citrate|@DISEASE_Hypertension_Pulmonary	Exercise-induced changes of vital signs in adults with sickle cell disease.The six-minute walk test (6MWT) has been used in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), in conjunction with tricuspid regurgitant velocity (TRV) and plasma N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro BNP), to assess risk of having pulmonary hypertension. Exercise-induced vital sign changes (VSCs) are predictors of clinical outcomes in other diseases. In this study, we assess the predictors and prognostic value of 6MWT VSC in adult SCD patients. Data from a multinational study of SCD patients (Treatment of Pulmonary Hypertension with Sildenafil: walk-PHaSST) were used to calculate the 6MWT VSC. Predictors of VSC were identified by a multivariable analysis, and a survival analysis was conducted by the Cox proportional hazard method. An increase in heart rate was observed in 90% of the 630 SCD adults, 77% of patients had an increase in systolic blood pressure (SBP), and 50% of patients had a decrease in oxygen saturation. TRV (odds ratio [OR] = 1.82, p = .020), absolute reticulocyte count (OR = 1.03, p < .001), and hemoglobin (OR = 0.99, p = .035) predicted oxygen desaturation >= 3% during the 6MWT. In the adjusted analysis, SBP increase during the 6MWT was associated with improved survival (hazards ratio = 0.3, 95% confidence interval: 0.1-0.8). Increases in heart rate and blood pressure, as well as oxygen desaturation, are common in adults with SCD during the 6MWT. VSC is associated with markers of anemia and TRV and can be used for risk stratification. Any increase in SBP during the 6MWT was associated with improved survival and may be indicative of a patient's ability to increase stroke volume.
34238241		Community based screening for sickle haemoglobin among pregnant women in Benue State, Nigeria: I-Care-to-Know, a Healthy Beginning Initiative.BACKGROUND: Haemoglobin genotype screening at prenatal care offers women an opportunity to be aware of their genotype, receive education on sickle cell disease (SCD) and may increase maternal demand for SCD newborn screening. In developed countries, most pregnant women who access prenatal care and deliver at the hospital receive haemoglobin genotype screening. In settings with low prenatal care attendance and low hospital deliveries, community-based screening may provide similar opportunity for pregnant women. We assessed the feasibility and acceptability of integrating haemoglobin genotype screening into an existing community-based HIV program. METHODS: Onsite community-based integrated testing for HIV, hepatitis B virus and haemoglobin electrophoresis, were conducted for pregnant women and their male partners. Community Health Advisors implementing the NIH and PEPFAR-supported Healthy Beginning Initiative (HBI) program provided education on SCD, collected blood sample for haemoglobin electrophoresis and provided test results to participants enrolled into the HBI program. We concurrently conducted a cross-sectional study using a pretested, semi-structured, interviewer administered questionnaire to collect demographic data and assess awareness of individual haemoglobin "genotype" among HBI pregnant women participants. RESULTS: In this study, 99.9% (10,167/10,168) of pregnant women who received education on SCD accepted and completed the survey, had blood drawn for haemoglobin electrophoresis and received their results. A majority of participating pregnant women (97.0%) were not aware of their haemoglobin "genotype". Among the participants who were incorrect about their haemoglobin "genotype", 41.1% (23/56) of women who reported their haemoglobin "genotype" as AA were actually AS. The odds of haemoglobin "genotype" awareness was higher among participants who were in younger age group, completed tertiary education, had less number of pregnancies, and attended antenatal care. Overall prevalence of sickle cell trait (AS) was 18.7%. CONCLUSIONS: It is feasible to integrate haemoglobin "genotype" testing into an existing community-based maternal-child program. Most pregnant women who were unaware of their haemoglobin "genotype" accepted and had haemoglobin genotype testing, and received their test results. Increasing parental awareness of their own haemoglobin "genotype" could increase their likelihood of accepting newborn screening for SCD.

Hemolysis and anemia are distinct but inter-related pathophysiological processes that underlie end-organ dysfunction in this condition. We hypothesized that real-world medical tests would reveal distinct contributions of hemolysis and anemia to certain cardiopulmonary changes in adults with SCD. METHODS: We assessed laboratory and clinical tests of cardiopulmonary function obtained during routine delivery of care in 442 adult SCD patients. We characterized hemolysis by the first principal component (PC1) of reticulocyte percent, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate amino transferase (AST) and total bilirubin- the hemolytic component. The relationships of hemoglobin concentration and hemolysis to organ dysfunction were analyzed by multiple regression and path analysis to identify independent associations. RESULTS: Degree of hemolysis and degree of anemia both associated independently with elevated values for left atrial diameter (LAD) and left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVED), and with lower percent predicted forced expiratory volume in first second (FEV1). Degree of hemolysis, but not anemia, associated independently with low values for oxygen saturation, forced vital capacity (FVC), and total lung capacity (TLC)]. Path analysis reinforced the trend by multiple regression for association of both degree of hemolysis and anemia with elevated TRV but not with lower diastolic blood pressure. DISCUSSION: Analysis of real-world clinical tests suggest that, although they are inter-related, the degrees of hemolysis and of anemia make independent contributions to cardiopulmonary dysfunction and that treatments that specifically target both aspects of sickle cell disease may be of maximal benefit.
34889416		Indications for transfusion in the management of sickle cell disease.The transfusion of red blood cells (RBCs) is a crucial treatment for sickle cell disease (SCD). While often beneficial, the frequent use of transfusions is associated with numerous complications. Transfusions should be offered with specific guidelines in mind. Here we present updates to the indications for transfusion of RBCs in SCD. We review recent publications and include expert perspectives from hematology and transfusion medicine. For some clinical indications, such as ischemic stroke, the role of transfusion has been well studied and can be applied almost universally. For many other clinical scenarios, the use of transfusion therapy has less conclusive data and therefore must be tailored to individual needs. We highlight the roles of RBC transfusions in preventing or mitigating neurological disease, in reducing perioperative complications, in managing acute chest syndrome, and in optimizing pregnancy outcomes in SCD. We further highlight various transfusion techniques and when each might be considered. Potential complications of transfusion are also briefly discussed.
37951090	cause|@CHEMICAL_Calcium|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell	Calcium flux alterations in erythrocytes from sickle cell mice: The relevance of mean corpuscular volume.Red blood cells (RBC) from patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) have elevated calcium levels at baseline, which are further elevated upon deoxygenation. Here we examined baseline calcium levels and calcium flux in RBCs from a mouse model of SCD mice. We found that akin to humans with SCD, sickle (HbSS) Townes mice, have higher baseline levels and increased calcium flux in RBCs compared to control (HbAA) animals. As HbSS mice, unlike humans with SCD, have high mean corpuscular volume compared with HbAA, we highlight the importance of adjusting biochemical results to number of RBCs rather than hematocrit during the analysis and interpretation of the results. Our findings add to the face validity of humanized sickle cell mice and support its use for studies of RBC calcium flux in SCD.

34564705		Myelopathy in sickle cell disease: a case-oriented review.INTRODUCTION: Although neurological complications are well recognized in patients with sickle cell disease, myelopathy has been rarely described, with few reported cases of compressive and ischemic myelopathy. We present the first case report of longitudinally extensive myelitis (LETM) in SCD and review the differential diagnosis of myelopathy in these patients. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 29-year-old African-Brazilian man with SCD, who experienced a subacute flaccid paraparesis, with T2 sensory level and urinary retention. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed a lymphocytic pleocytosis and increased protein levels. MRI disclosed a longitudinally extensive spinal cord lesion, with a high T2/STIR signal extending from C2 to T12. We searched Medline/PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases for myelopathy in SCD patients. DISCUSSION: Spinal cord compression by vertebral fractures, extramedullary hematopoietic tissue, and Salmonella epidural abscess have been reported in SCD. We found only three case reports of spinal cord infarction, which is unexpectedly infrequent compared to the prevalence of cerebral infarction in SCD. We found only one case report of varicella-zoster myelitis and no previous report of LETM in SCD patients. Specific and time-sensitive causes of myelopathy should be considered in SCD patients. In addition to compression and ischemia, LETM is a possible mechanism of spinal cord involvement in SCD patients.
33890391		Implementing newborn screening for sickle cell disease in Korle Bu Teaching Hospital, Accra: Results and lessons learned.BACKGROUND: Early diagnosis of sickle cell disease (SCD) through newborn screening (NBS) is a cost-effective intervention, which reduces morbidity and mortality. In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) where disease burden is greatest, there are no universal NBS programs and few institutions have the capacity to conduct NBS. We determined the feasibility and challenges of implementing NBS for SCD in Ghana's largest public hospital. PROCEDURE: The SCD NBS program at Korle Bu Teaching Hospital (KBTH) is a multiyear partnership between the hospital and the SickKids Center for Global Child Health, Toronto, being implemented in phases. The 13-month demonstration phase (June 2017-July 2018) and phase one (November 2018-December 2019) focused on staff training and the feasibility of universal screening of babies born in KBTH. RESULTS: During the demonstration phase, 115 public health nurses and midwives acquired competency in heel stick for dried blood spot sampling. Out of 9990 newborns, 4427 babies (44.3%) were screened, of which 79 (1.8%) were identified with presumptive SCD (P-SCD). Major challenges identified included inadequate nursing staff to perform screening, shortage of screening supplies, and delays in receiving screening results. Strategies to overcome some of the challenges were incorporated into phase one, resulting in increased screening coverage to 83.7%. CONCLUSIONS: Implementing NBS for SCD in KBTH presented challenges with implications on achieving and sustaining universal NBS in KBTH and other settings in SSA. Specific steps addressing these challenges comprehensively will help build on the modest initial gains, moving closer toward a sustainable national NBS program.
38066905		Using disease-modifying therapies in sickle cell disease.As curative therapy using allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation as well as gene therapy and gene editing remains inaccessible to most patients with sickle cell disease, the availability of drug therapies that are safe, efficacious, and affordable is highly desirable. Increasing progress is being made in developing drug therapies based on our understanding of disease pathophysiology. Four drugs, hydroxyurea, L-glutamine, crizanlizumab, and voxelotor, are currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, with multiple others at various stages of testing. With the limited efficacy of individual agents, combinations of agents will likely be required for optimal outcomes.

Faced with the opportunity to spur research and advance treatments for SCD, and at the recommendation of advisors, the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation (DDCF) offered an SCD research funding opportunity starting in 2009 through its Innovations in Clinical Research Awards (ICRA) program. Twenty-eight new grants of $450 000 for direct costs over 3 years and 7 renewals were awarded, for a total investment of $17 million. Only about half the research teams garnered follow-on funding directly related to their ICRA projects, but the financial return on the research investment was substantial (~4 times the original $17 million or 300%). All but 1 of the ICRA investigative teams published original research reports that acknowledged DDCF as a source of funding; the median number of publications per team was 3. Major innovations in the diagnosis and treatment of SCD included but were not limited to a demonstration that genetic modification of BCL11A enhancer is a potentially important treatment modality, establishment that plerixafor mobilization is safe and effective for those with SCD, development and validation of a new diagnostic called SCD BioChip, and evidence that hydroxyurea treatment is safe and efficacious in African children. These outcomes show that relatively small research grants can have a substantial return on investment and result in significant advances for a disease such as SCD.
34338553		Sickle Cell Disorders and Severe COVID-19 Outcomes: A Cohort Study.
34413468		A prospective cohort study on the intersectionality of obesity, chronic disease, social factors, and incident risk of COVID-19 in US low-income minority middle-age mothers.OBJECTIVE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has disproportionally affected communities of color. We aimed to determine what factors are associated with COVID-19 testing and test positivity in an underrepresented, understudied, and underreported (U3) population of mothers. METHODS: This study included 2996 middle-aged mothers of the Boston Birth Cohort (a sample of predominantly urban, low-income, Black and Hispanic mothers) who were enrolled shortly after they gave birth and followed onward at the Boston Medical Center. COVID-19 testing and test positivity were defined by the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test. Two-probit Heckman selection models were performed to identify factors associated with test positivity while accounting for potential selection associated with COVID testing. RESULTS: The mean (SD) age of study mothers was 41.9 (+-7.7) years. In the sample, 1741 (58.1%) and 667 (22.3%) mothers were self-identified as Black and Hispanic, respectively. A total of 396 mothers had COVID-19 testing and of those, 95 mothers tested positive from March 2020 to February 2021. Among a multitude of factors examined, factors associated with the probability of being tested were obesity (RR = 1.27; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.08-1.49); and presence of preexisting chronic medical conditions including hypertension, asthma, stroke, and other comorbidities (coronary heart disease, chronic kidney disease, and sickle cell disease) with a corresponding RR = 1.40 (95% CI: 1.23-1.60); 1.29 (95% CI: 1.11-1.50); 1.44 (95% CI: 1.23-1.68); and 1.37 (95% CI: 1.12-1.67), respectively. Factors associated with higher incident risk of a positive COVID-19 test were body mass index, birthplace outside of the USA, and being without a college-level education. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the intersectionality of obesity and social factors in modulating incident risk of COVID-19 in this sample of US Black and Hispanic middle-aged mothers. Methodologically, our findings underscore the importance of accounting for potential selection bias in COVID-19 testing in order to obtain unbiased estimates of COVID-19 infection.

34477545		Sickle cell disease children's gut colonization by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacterales: an antibiotic prophylaxis effect?Introduction. Sickle cell disease (SCD) children have a high susceptibility to pneumococcal infection. For this reason, they are routinely immunized with pneumococcal vaccines and use antibiotic prophylaxis (AP).Hypothesis/Gap Statement. Yet, little is known about SCD children's gut microbiota. If antibiotic-resistant Enterobacterales may colonize people on AP, we hypothesized that SCD children on AP are colonized by resistant enterobacteria species.Objective. To evaluate the effect of continuous AP on Enterobacterales gut colonization from children with SCD.Methodology. We analysed 30 faecal swabs from SCD children on AP and 21 swabs from children without the same condition. Enterobacterales was isolated on MacConkey agar plates and identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) (bioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France). We performed the antibiogram by Vitek 2 system (bioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France), and the resistance genes were identified by multiplex PCR.Results. We found four different species with resistance to one or more different antibiotic types in the AP-SCD children's group: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii, and Citrobacter farmeri. Colonization by resistant E. coli was associated with AP (prevalence ratio 2.69, 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1.98-3.67, P<0.001). Strains producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) were identified only in SCD children, E. coli, 4/30 (13 %), and K. pneumoniae, 2/30 (7 %). The ESBL-producing Enterobacterales were associated with penicillin G benzathine use (95 % CI, 22.91-86.71, P<0.001). CTX-M-1 was the most prevalent among ESBL-producers (3/6, 50 %), followed by CTX-M-9 (2/6, 33 %), and CTX-M-2 (1/6, 17 %).Conclusion. Resistant enterobacteria colonize SCD children on AP, and this therapy raises the chance of ESBL-producing Enterobacterales colonization. Future studies should focus on prophylactic vaccines as exclusive therapy against pneumococcal infections.
37748509		High Throughput Newborn Screening for Sickle Cell Disease - Application of Two-Tiered Testing with a qPCR-Based Primary screen.BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of hemoglobinopathies with a common point mutation causing the production of sickle cell hemoglobin (HbS). In high-throughput newborn screening (NBS) for SCD, a two-step procedure is suitable, in which qPCR first pre-selects relevant samples that are differentiated by a second method. METHODS: Three NBS centers using qPCR-based primary screening for SCD performed a laboratory comparison. Methods using tandem MS or HPLC were used for differentiation. RESULTS: In a benchmarking test, 450 dried blood samples were analyzed. Samples containing HbS were detected as reliably by qPCR as by methods established for hemoglobinopathy testing. In a two-step screening approach, the 2nd-tier-analyses have to distinguish the carrier status from pathological variants. In nine months of regular screening, a total of 353,219 samples were analyzed using two-stage NBS procedures. The 1st-tier screening by qPCR reduced the number of samples for subsequent differentiation by>99.5%. Cases with carrier status or other variants were identified as inconspicuous while 78 cases with SCD were revealed. The derived incidence of 1:4,773, is in good agreement with previously published incidences. CONCLUSION: In high-throughput NBS for SCD, qPCR is suitable to focus 2nd-tier analyses on samples containing HbS, while being unaffected by factors such as prematurity or transfusions. The substantial reduction of samples numbers positively impacts resource conservation, sustainability, and cost-effectiveness. No false negative cases came to attention.
37981193	associate|@CHEMICAL_Urea|@DISEASE_Liver_Failure	The liver in sickle cell disease.Liver involvement in SCD patients is frequent but often misdiagnosed or underestimated, except in case of advanced liver diseases. Because of so far poorly recognized forms of chronic SCD-related vascular injury that can silently evolved towards end stages or facilitate ACLF, any persisting liver function tests abnormalities should be carefully investigated, following the above proposed algorithm. Work up and management must be considered multidisciplinary in relationship with a Hepatologist. Early SCD hepatopathy should prompt revision of SCD management to prevent further liver injury and decompensation, discussing transfusion exchanges and hydro urea when not yet initiated, and control for any cofactor of liver injury. The role of HSCT in early SCD hepatopathies also deserves evaluation. In advanced SCD hepatopathies, liver transplantation, which has been rarely performed so far, is the only therapeutic option associated with improved survival. It should definitely be discussed- either electively in case of decompensation in SCD cirrhosis or jaundice/recurrent cholangitis in cholestatic diseases, with excellent outcome, - or emergently in case of ALF or ACLF with more mitigate results. To improve knowledge and management of SCD liver diseases, creation of national and international registries, as well as longitudinal observational cohorts are encouraged.

We evaluated the use of standardized flow adhesion biomarkers in a six-month, 35-subjects longitudinal study (ELIPSIS). Flow adhesion of whole blood on P-selectin (FA-WB-Psel) and VCAM1 (FA-WB-VCAM), and of isolated white blood cells on P-selectin (FA-WBC-Psel) and VCAM-1 (FA-WBC-VCAM) were elevated on VOC days compared with non-VOC days, but only FA-WB-Psel reached statistical significance (P = 0 015). Optimal cut-off values were established with Cox regression models for FA-WB-Psel [46 cells/mm2; hazard ratio (HR): 2 3; 95% confidence interval (CI):1 4-4 0; P = 0 01] and FA-WB-VCAM (408 cells/mm2, HR:1 8; 95% CI: 0 9-3 45; P = 0 01). A combined (FA-WB-Psel and FA-WB-VCAM) multimarker risk score was also significantly (P = 0 0006) correlated with VOC risk that was two-fold higher for intermediate and 5 64-fold higher for high score. The concordance (C)-index for the multimarker score was 0 63 in the six-month period (95% CI: 0 56-0 70), indicating a better ability to distinguish patient risk of VOC, compared to individual biomarkers FA-WB-VCAM (C-index: 0 57; 95% CI: 0 49-0 65) or FA-WB-Psel (C-index: 0 58; 95% CI: 0 53-0 62). The presented multimarker score can be used to risk-stratify individuals with SCD during their steady state into low, intermediate, and high-risk strata for self-reported VOCs. Such risk stratification could help focus healthcare resources more efficiently to maintiain health, personalize treatment selection to each patient's individual needs, and potentially reduce healthcare costs.
33617594		Characteristics of sickle cell patients with frequent emergency department visits and hospitalizations.Vaso-occlusive episodes (VOEs) are a hallmark of sickle cell disease (SCD), and account for >90% of health care encounters for this patient population. The Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease, a large study enrolling >3000 patients, showed that the majority of SCD patients (80%) experienced 0-3 major pain crises/year. Only a small minority (~5%) experienced >=6 VOEs/year. Our study sought to further understand this difference in VOE frequency between SCD patients. We analyzed 25 patients (13M/12F, mean age of 28.8) with >=6 ED visits or hospitalizations/year (high utilizers), and compared these with 9 patients (6M/3F, mean age of 37.6) who had <=2 ED visits or hospitalizations/year (low utilizers). All subjects were given a demographic survey along with questionnaires for depression, anxiety, and Health Locus of Control. Each subject then underwent quantitative sensory testing (QST) with three different modalities: pressure pain sensitivity, heat and cold sensitivity, and Von Frey monofilament testing. Laboratory and clinical data were collected through subjects' medical records. CBC and chemistry analysis showed high utilizers had higher WBC (p<0.01), ANC (p<0.01), total bilirubin (p = 0.02), and lower MCV (p = 0.03). Opioid use (morphine equivalents) over the past 6 months was significantly higher in the high utilizer group (12125.7 mg vs 2423.1 mg, p = 0.005). QST results showed lower pressure pain threshold at the ulna (224.4 KPa vs 338.9 KPa, p = 0.04) in the high utilizer group. High utilizers also had higher anxiety (9.0 vs 4.6, p = 0.04) and depression scores (10.0 vs 6.0, p = 0.051). While the low utilizer group had higher education levels with more associate and bachelor degrees (p = 0.009), there was no difference in income or employment. These data show that many biological and psychosocial factors contribute to high health care utilization in SCD. A multi-disciplinary and multi-faceted approach will be required to address this complex problem.
34581773		American Society of Hematology 2021 guidelines for sickle cell disease: stem cell transplantation.BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a life-limiting inherited hemoglobinopathy that results in significant complications and affects quality of life. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is currently the only curative intervention for SCD; however, guidelines are needed to inform how to apply HSCT in clinical practice. OBJECTIVE: These evidence-based guidelines of the American Society of Hematology (ASH) are intended to support patients, clinicians, and health professionals in their decisions about HSCT for SCD. METHODS: The multidisciplinary guideline panel formed by ASH included 2 patient representatives and was balanced to minimize potential bias from conflicts of interest. The Mayo Evidence-Based Practice Research Program supported the guideline development process, including performing systematic evidence reviews (through 2019). The panel prioritized clinical questions and outcomes according to their importance for clinicians and patients. The panel used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, including GRADE Evidence-to-Decision frameworks, to assess evidence and make recommendations, which were subject to public comment. RESULTS: The panel agreed on 8 recommendations to help patients and providers assess how individuals with SCD should consider the timing and type of HSCT. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence review yielded no randomized controlled clinical trials for HSCT in SCD; therefore, all recommendations are based on very low certainty in the evidence. Key recommendations include considering HSCT for those with neurologic injury or recurrent acute chest syndrome at an early age and to improve nonmyeloablative regimens. Future research should include the development of a robust SCD registry to serve as a comparator for HSCT studies.
34879377		Two Sides of a Coin: Case Report of Unilateral Synangiosis and Contralateral Stroke Highlighting Consequences of Disease Progression and Efficacy of Revascularization in Sickle Cell Disease-Associated Moyamoya Syndrome.Moyamoya syndrome increases the risk of stroke in sickle cell disease, but revascularization surgery can modify this risk. Collaborative management between hematology and neurosurgery offers effective strategies to reduce stroke risk in these patients. We describe a challenging case where a patient with sickle cell disease undergoing standard of care management as prescribed by the Stroke Prevention Trial in Sickle Cell Anemia and revascularization with pial synangiosis subsequently developed rapidly progressive disease in other cerebral vessels and suffered ischemic hemispheric stroke. This case not only demonstrates the success of management in accordance with the American Heart Association (AHA) and American Stroke Association (ASA) guidelines but also demonstrates critical areas where we lack understanding of disease progression.

However, there are few large-scale reports on its long-term use and certain caregivers and patients have concerns about its safety. Following the licensing of HU in Europe for children and adults with severe forms of SCD, ESCORT-HU was designed as a Phase IV observational cohort study. It included 1906 participants, of whom 55% were adults. The most common hemoglobin (Hb) genotypes were HbSS (84.7%) and HbSbeta+ (7.0%). The median duration of follow-up was 45 months, for a total of 7309 patient-years of observation. The dose of HU after 1 year was 20.6 mg/kg/d for children and 16.3 mg/kg/d for adults. There was a statistically significant decrease in the number of vaso-occlusive episodes lasting >48 h, acute chest syndrome episodes, hospitalizations, and the percentage of patients requiring blood transfusions within the first 12 months relative to the year before enrolment. Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were the most commonly reported adverse effects. No new HU toxicity was identified. Overall, 125 pregnancies were reported in 101 women and no malformations were observed in the neonates. There were 12 pregnancies for partners of male patients treated with HU. One case of fatal myelodysplastic syndrome was reported, for which a causal association with HU could not be excluded. This cohort study of patients with SCD highlights the positive benefit-to-risk ratio of HU in children and adults.

33658643		Correction of murine sickle cell disease by allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation with anti-3rd party veto cells.Despite advances in gene therapy allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCT) remains the most effective way to cure sickle cell disease (SCD). However, there are substantial challenges including lack of suitable donors, therapy-related toxicity (TRM) and risk of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). Perhaps the most critical question is when to do a transplant for SCD. Safer transplant protocols for HLA-disparate HSCT is needed before transplants are widely accepted for SCD. Although risk of GvHD and TRM are less with T-cell-deplete HSCT and reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC), transplant rejection is a challenge. We have reported graft rejection of T cell-depleted non-myeloablative HSCT can be overcome in wild type fully mis-matched recipient mice, using donor-derived anti-3rd party central memory CD8-positive veto cells combined with short-term low-dose rapamycin. Here, we report safety and efficacy of this approach in a murine model for SCD. Durable donor-derived chimerism was achieved using this strategy with reversal of pathological parameters of SCD, including complete conversion to normal donor-derived red cells, and correction of splenomegaly and the levels of circulating reticulocytes, hematocrit, and hemoglobin.

Given the rare nature of this tumor, accounting for less than 0.5% of all renal carcinomas, most of the published data on therapies is from case reports and small case series, and current treatments are insufficient, with most patients succumbing to their disease in months. We report our experience with a cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen consisting of platinum-based therapy, doxorubicin, and bortezomib. METHODS: Three patients with metastatic RMC at a single institution were treated off-label with a perioperative chemotherapy regimen for 4 cycles of 2 alternating regimens: regimen A consisting of cisplatin, doxorubicin, and bortezomib; regimen B consisting of carboplatin, paclitaxel, and gemcitabine. A radical nephrectomy was performed on all patients. Surveillance imaging was performed on all patients to assess response and disease burden. Patients received up to 12 months of maintenance therapy with everolimus. RESULTS: Three African American patients - 2 males and 1 female aged 14, 28, and 31 - with sickle cell trait and metastatic disease were treated with this regimen. The median follow-up was 18 months. All had resection of the primary tumor - 2 patients after receiving neoadjuvant therapy, and one patient underwent resection prior to referral. All 3 patients achieved complete responses based on imaging, 2 of which lasted for 12 months, and another is still in remission over 7 years after diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: This regimen of alternating cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy with bortezomib appeared to be active against RMC and was generally well-tolerated. Given the extremely rare nature of this disease and dismal prognosis, new treatment modalities should be pursued, and whenever possible, patients should be enrolled in a clinical trial. We propose that a multiinstitution clinical trial of this regiment may be warranted.

38296295		Protocol for an evaluation of the initiation of an integrated longitudinal outpatient care model for severe chronic non-communicable diseases (PEN-Plus) at secondary care facilities (district hospitals) in 10 lower-income countries.INTRODUCTION: The Package of Essential Noncommunicable Disease Interventions-Plus (PEN-Plus) is a strategy decentralising care for severe non-communicable diseases (NCDs) including type 1 diabetes, rheumatic heart disease and sickle cell disease, to increase access to care. In the PEN-Plus model, mid-level clinicians in intermediary facilities in low and lower middle income countries are trained to provide integrated care for conditions where services traditionally were only available at tertiary referral facilities. For the upcoming phase of activities, 18 first-level hospitals in 9 countries and 1 state in India were selected for PEN-Plus expansion and will treat a variety of severe NCDs. Over 3 years, the countries and state are expected to: (1) establish PEN-Plus clinics in one or two district hospitals, (2) support these clinics to mature into training sites in preparation for national or state-level scale-up, and (3) work with the national or state-level stakeholders to describe, measure and advocate for PEN-Plus to support development of a national operational plan for scale-up. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Guided by Proctor outcomes for implementation research, we are conducting a mixed-method evaluation consisting of 10 components to understand outcomes in clinical implementation, training and policy development. Data will be collected through a mix of quantitative surveys, routine reporting, routine clinical data and qualitative interviews. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This protocol has been considered exempt or covered by central and local institutional review boards. Findings will be disseminated throughout the project's course, including through quarterly M&E discussions, semiannual formative assessments, dashboard mapping of progress, quarterly newsletters, regular feedback loops with national stakeholders and publication in peer-reviewed journals.
33661168	associate|@CHEMICAL_Busulfan|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell	Is Busulfan Clearance Different in Patients With Sickle Cell Disease? Let's Clear Up That Case With Some Controls.In busulfan-based conditioning regimen for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in children, accurate a priori determination of the first dose is important because of its narrow therapeutic window. Sickle cell disease (SCD) influences pharmacokinetics of the commonly used drugs by affecting organs responsible for drug metabolism and elimination. This pharmacokinetics study assesses the influence of SCD on the metabolic pathway of busulfan that is mainly metabolized in the liver. In this retrospective cross-sectional case-control study, 16 patients with SCD were matched to 50 patients without SCD on known busulfan clearance's covariates (glutathione-S-transferase alpha1 polymorphisms, age, weight). Clearance of the first dose of busulfan was not significantly different independently of genetic or anthropometric factors in patients with or without SCD.
35950054		Pregnancy in the Sickle Cell Disease and Fetomaternal Outcomes in Different Sickle cell Genotypes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.Background: Pregnancy is a major concern among women with the sickle cell disease (SCD), and it is associated with increased adverse outcomes. The aim of the present meta-analysis is to report the fetomaternal outcomes in different sickle cell genotypes. Methods: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, a comprehensive search of databases and search engines such as PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, ProQuest, Cochrane Library, Science Direct and Google Scholar were performed. Any observational studies that had compared at least one outcome such as maternal outcomes, fetal outcomes, and morbidity between two groups of pregnant women with different types of sickle cell genotypes and pregnant women without SCD were evaluated. Results: A total number of 9,827 pregnant women with SCD were examined. The results showed that pregnancy in SCD increased the risk of adverse outcomes for the mothers (including postpartum hemorrhage, prematurity, pregnancy-induced hypertension, pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, cesarean section, lower segment cesareansection, maternal death), fetus (including live births, low birth weight, intrauterine growth restriction, APGAR score at 5 min <7, stillbirth, neonatal death, perinatal mortality, acute fetal distress, intrauterine fetal death) and morbidity among the SCD(severe anemia, urinary tract infection, blood transfusion, painful crisis, acute chest syndrome, vaso-occlusive crises). Conclusion: According to the results of this meta-analysis, pregnancy in the SCD is associated with an increased risk of maternal outcomes, fetal outcomes, and morbidity among SCD patients with different genotypes. Pregnancy in sickle cell hemoglobinopathies needs careful multidisciplinary management and cautious caring so as to decrease maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality.
34958973	associate|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell|@GENE_CSF3	Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor Is Safe and Well Tolerated following Allogeneic Transplantation in Patients with Sickle Cell Disease.Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) used after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can enhance neutrophil recovery in patients rendered neutropenic by the preparative regimen. G-CSF is contraindicated in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), because life-threatening complications can ensue in the presence of sickle vasculopathy. The safety profile of G-CSF after HSCT for SCD has not been described, however. We report clinical outcomes in the first 100 days post-HSCT in 62 patients supported with G-CSF until neutrophil recovery on a clinical trial of reduced- intensity conditioning HSCT for SCD. The patients received G-CSF for a median of 9 days (range, 5 to 33 days) post-transplantation from the best available stem cell source. Preparation for transplantation included a target hemoglobin S level of <=45%. Neutrophil engraftment (absolute neutrophil count >0.5 x 103/mL) was achieved at a median of 13 days (range, 10 to 34 days), and platelet engraftment (>50 x 103/mL) was achieved at a median of 19 days (range, 12 to 71 days). The median duration of inpatient hospitalization following stem cell infusion (day 0) was 21.5 days (range, 11 to 33 days). No patient developed SCD-related complications following G-CSF use. The most common organ toxicities encountered between G-CSF initiation (on day +7) and day +100 were anorexia (n = 14), hypertension (n = 11), and electrolyte imbalance requiring correction (n = 9). Central nervous system-related events were noted in 5 patients, all of whom had preexisting cerebral vasculopathy/moyamoya disease, attributed to reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome in the presence of calcineurin inhibitor therapy and hypertension. We conclude that G-CSF does not adversely impact SCD HSCT recipients and can be safely used post-transplantation to enhance neutrophil recovery.
38112802		Point-of-care brain ultrasound and transcranial doppler or color-coded doppler in critically ill neonates and children.Point-of-care brain ultrasound and transcranial doppler or color-coded doppler is being increasingly used as an essential diagnostic and monitoring tool at the bedside of critically ill neonates and children. Brain ultrasound has already established as a cornerstone of daily practice in the management of the critically ill newborn for diagnosis and follow-up of the most common brain diseases, considering the easiness to insonate the brain through transfontanellar window. In critically ill children, doppler based techniques are used to assess cerebral hemodynamics in acute brain injury and recommended for screening patients suffering from sickle cell disease at risk for stroke. However, more evidence is needed regarding the accuracy of doppler based techniques for non-invasive estimation of cerebral perfusion pressure and intracranial pressure, as well as regarding the accuracy of brain ultrasound for diagnosis and monitoring of acute brain parenchyma alterations in children. This review is aimed at providing a comprehensive overview for clinicians of the technical, anatomical, and physiological basics for brain ultrasonography and transcranial doppler or color-coded doppler, and of the current status and future perspectives of their clinical applications in critically ill neonates and children. CONCLUSION: In critically ill neonates, brain ultrasound for diagnosis and follow-up of the most common cerebral pathologies of the neonatal period may be considered the standard of care. Data are needed about the possible role of doppler techniques for the assessment of cerebral perfusion and vasoreactivity of the critically ill neonate with open fontanelles. In pediatric critical care, doppler based techniques should be routinely adopted to assess and monitor cerebral hemodynamics. New technologies and more evidence are needed to improve the accuracy of brain ultrasound for the assessment of brain parenchyma of critically ill children with fibrous fontanelles. WHAT IS KNOWN:   In critically ill neonates, brain ultrasound for early diagnosis and follow-up of the most common cerebral and neurovascular pathologies of the neonatal period is a cornerstone of daily practice. In critically ill children, doppler-based techniques are more routinely used to assess cerebral hemodynamics and autoregulation after acute brain injury and to screen patients at risk for vasospasm or stroke (e.g., sickle cell diseases, right-to-left shunts). WHAT IS NEW:   In critically ill neonates, research is currently focusing on the use of novel high frequency probes, even higher than 10 MHz, especially for extremely preterm babies. Furthermore, data are needed about the role of doppler based techniques for the assessment of cerebral perfusion and vasoreactivity of the critically ill neonate with open fontanelles, also integrated with a non-invasive assessment of brain oxygenation. In pediatric critical care, new technologies should be developed to improve the accuracy of brain ultrasound for the assessment of brain parenchyma of critically ill children with fibrous fontanelles. Furthermore, large multicenter studies are needed to clarify role and accuracy of doppler-based techniques to assess cerebral perfusion pressure and its changes after treatment interventions.

All current gene therapy protocols require ex vivo modification of autologous hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). However, several SCD-related problems impair HSC collection, including a stressed and damaged bone marrow, potential cytotoxicity by the major therapeutic drug hydroxyurea, and inability to use granulocyte colony stimulating factor, which can precipitate severe vaso-occlusive events. RECENT FINDINGS: Peripheral blood mobilization of HSCs using the CXCR4 antagonist plerixafor followed by apheresis collection was recently shown to be safe and effective for most SCD patients and is the current strategy for mobilizing HSCs. However, exceptionally large numbers of HSCs are required to manufacture an adequate cellular product, responses to plerixafor are variable, and most patients require multiple mobilization cycles, increasing the risk for adverse events. For some, gene therapy is prohibited by the failure to obtain adequate numbers of HSCs. SUMMARY: Here we review the current knowledge on HSC collection from individuals with SCD and potential improvements that may enhance the safety, efficacy, and availability of gene therapy for this disorder.
34982335		Health Care Providers Perceptions About Preconception Care in Ibadan, Southwest Nigeria: A Qualitative Study.OBJECTIVES: Preconception care (PCC) is a recognised strategy for optimising maternal health and improving maternal and neonatal outcomes. PCC services are minimally available and not fully integrated into maternal health services in Nigeria. This study explored perceptions about PCC services among health care providers in Ibadan, Nigeria. METHODS: Using a qualitative case study design the perspectives of 26 health care providers-16 specialist physicians and nine nurses covering 10 specialties at the primary, secondary and tertiary health care levels was explored. In-depth interviews were digitally recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed on MAXQDA using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Almost all participants stated that PCC services should be offered at all three levels of health care with referral when needed between lower and higher levels. Participants stated that although all people of reproductive age would benefit from PCC, those who had medical problems like hypertension, sickle cell disease, diabetes and infertility would benefit more. Participants opined that delayed health care seeking observed in the community may influence acceptability of PCC especially for people without known pre-existing conditions. All specialist physicians identified the relevance of PCC to their practice. They identified potential benefits of PCC including opportunity to prepare for pregnancy to ensure positive pregnancy outcomes. CONCLUSIONS FOR PRACTICE: Preconception care is perceived as important for promoting positive pregnancy outcomes in people with known medical problems and is relevant to different specialities of medical practice. Provision of the service will require establishment of guidelines and uptake will depend on acceptability to community members who will benefit from the service.
33741487		Impact of COVID-19 on vasooclusive crisis in patients with sickle cell anaemia.OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to assess COVID-19 impact on the morbidity and mortality of vasooclusive crisis (VOC) in sickle cell anaemia (SCA) patients. METHODS: A prospective cohort study of 100 SCA patients; 50 with COVID-19 (COVID group) and 50 without (non-COVID group). All patients signed written informed consent. RESULTS: The COVID group had a significantly higher VOC episode median per year; 3 (IQR,1-6) vs 2 (IQR,2-12) (P < 0.05). The need for hospitalisation was similar in both groups. The non-COVID group had more history of culture-proven infection (P = 0.05). The COVID-group had more osteonecrosis (P < 0.05), splenic sequestration, splenomegaly and hepatic crisis (P = 0.05, 0.006, 0.02; respectively) and significantly higher (P < 0.05) symptoms of fever, cough, fatigue, abdominal pain and anosmia. Mean haemoglobin, lymphocyte subset, platelets, and reticulocytes were reduced in both groups, while lactate dehydrogenase and ferritin levels were significantly elevated. In the COVID group, the rise in white blood cell count, reticulocyte percentage, platelets and ferritin was subdued (P < 0.05). Two patients in the COVID group and 3 in the non-COVID group died; there was no statistically significant difference in mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Although COVID-19 may have triggered the onset of VOC, it did not significantly influence VOC-related morbidity or mortality in this SCA cohort.
33666615		Microfluidic electrical impedance assessment of red blood cell-mediated microvascular occlusion.Alterations in the deformability of red blood cells (RBCs), occurring in hemolytic blood disorders such as sickle cell disease (SCD), contribute to vaso-occlusion and disease pathophysiology. There are few functional in vitro assays for standardized assessment of RBC-mediated microvascular occlusion. Here, we present the design, fabrication, and clinical testing of the Microfluidic Impedance Red Cell Assay (MIRCA) with embedded capillary network-based micropillar arrays and integrated electrical impedance measurement electrodes to address this need. The micropillar arrays consist of microcapillaries ranging from 12 mum to 3 mum, with each array paired with two sputtered gold electrodes to measure the impedance change of the array before and after sample perfusion through the microfluidic device. We define RBC occlusion index (ROI) and RBC electrical impedance index (REI), which represent the cumulative percentage occlusion and cumulative percentage impedance change, respectively. We demonstrate the promise of MIRCA in two common red cell disorders, SCD and hereditary spherocytosis. We show that the electrical impedance measurement reflects the microvascular occlusion, where REI significantly correlates with ROI that is obtained via high-resolution microscopy imaging of the microcapillary arrays. Further, we show that RBC-mediated microvascular occlusion, represented by ROI and REI, associates with clinical treatment outcomes and correlates with in vivo hemolytic biomarkers, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level and absolute reticulocyte count (ARC) in SCD. Impedance measurement obviates the need for high-resolution imaging, enabling future translation of this technology for widespread access, portable and point-of-care use. Our findings suggest that the presented microfluidic design and the integrated electrical impedance measurement provide a reproducible functional test for standardized assessment of RBC-mediated microvascular occlusion. MIRCA and the newly defined REI may serve as an in vitro therapeutic efficacy benchmark for assessing the clinical outcome of emerging RBC-modifying targeted and curative therapies.

We examined by oximetry adults (aged 18-45 years) with SCA presenting symptoms indicative of polysomnography, at a single institution, irrespective of treatment, for nocturnal hypoxaemia. Clinical labs and blood for in vitro assessments were taken upon enrolment and after 8-12 weeks of oxygen therapy or observation. Of 21 screened participants, nine (43%) had sufficient nocturnal hypoxaemia to warrant oxygen therapy (>=5 min at SpO2  <= 88%). Time spent at SpO2  <= 88% associated with age (p = 0.0092), annual hospitalizations (p = 0.0018) and anaemia (p = 0.0139), as well as plasma levels of TNFalpha (p = 0.0019) and IL-4 (p = 0.0147). Longitudinal analysis showed that WBC significantly decreased during the follow-up period in hypoxic individuals but not in non-hypoxic individuals (p = 0.0361 and p = 0.6969 respectively). Plasma levels of CCL2 and IL-1ra tended to increase, while levels of red blood cell reactive oxygen species tended to decrease with oxygen therapy. Overall, nocturnal hypoxaemia was common in this pilot study population and associated with plausible clinical comorbidities; oxygen therapy may decrease inflammation and oxidative damage in hypoxic individuals.

36382420		Characterising the prevalence of overweight and obese status among adults with sickle cell disease.Individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD) have historically been considered underweight. Despite increasing body mass index (BMI) in the general population, the prevalence of overweight and obese status remains unclear in the adult SCD population. Our primary aim was to determine the prevalence of overweight and obese status and to identify associations between BMI, demographic, and clinical characteristics. We conducted an analysis of abstracted electronic health record data and patient-reported outcomes from the Sickle Cell Disease Implementation Consortium registry; individuals aged 20-45 years were included. The median (interquartile range) BMI for the 1664 adults in this analysis was 23.9 (21.1-28) kg/m2 . In this cohort, 42.9% had a BMI of >25 kg/m2 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention definition of overweight/obese). In multivariable analysis, higher odds of being overweight or obese were associated with female gender, older age, college education, private insurance, and hypertension diagnosis. Higher odds of a BMI of >25 kg/m2 were observed in individuals with HbSC or HbSbeta+ thalassaemia regardless of hydroxycarbamide (hydroxyurea) exposure (odds ratio [OR] 3.4, p < 0.0001) and HbSS or HbSbeta0 thalassaemia exposed to hydroxycarbamide (OR 1.6, p = 0.0003) compared to those with HbSS or HbSbeta0 thalassaemia with no hydroxycarbamide exposure. These data highlight the importance of early identification, prevention, and intervention for increasing BMI to reduce obesity-related complications that may impact SCD-related complications.
38380832		Donors with repeated blood product discards for filtration problems, clots or hemolysis: Causes and follow-up.INTRODUCTION: Sanquin donor medicine department is informed when donations or their components are rejected. This can occur isolated or frequently. It is undesirable because the donations cannot be used and there may be an underlying medical cause. Based on regional approaches, a uniform procedure was developed. METHODS: Information about whole blood, plasma- plateletpheresis donations from which one or more components were rejected for filtration time (>2 h), hemolysis or clots were extracted from blood bank information system. After rejection of two successive components or donations or total >=3 the donor is contacted. Depending on the medical history and investigation by the family doctor, the donor carrier is re-evaluated. We looked for the causes of the discarded products and performed a survey among blood services regarding polices with discarded products. RESULTS: One or more components from 1742 of about 2.2 million successful donations (0.08%) were rejected. The highest percentage of rejection was seen in plateletpheresis (1.5%), all for clots. No underlying medical causes were found. 24 whole blood donors were found to have sickle cell trait (SCT) and were permanently deferred. The policies for follow-up after discarded products or acceptance of SCT donors vary between the 16 blood banks. Six organizations do not follow-up donors and seven accept SCT for blood or plasma donation. CONCLUSION: Informing donors with repeated discarded products avoids the non-use of donations. Causes of repeated discarded products can be found by follow-up of donors. The results of the survey indicate a large discrepancy in policies applied worldwide.

Although monogenic, phenotypes are markedly heterogeneous in terms of severity and life span. Hydroxyurea is still the most common treatment for these patients, and the response to treatment is highly variable and seems to be an inherited trait. Therefore, identifying the variants that might predict hydroxyurea response is important for identifying patients who will have a poorer or non-response to treatment, and the ones that are more prone to suffer from severe side effects. In the present pharmacogenetic study, we analyzed the exons of 77 genes described in the literature as potentially associated with hydroxyurea metabolism in Angolan children treated with hydroxyurea and evaluated the drug response considering fetal hemoglobin levels, other hematological and biochemical parameters, hemolysis, number of vaso-occlusive crises and hospitalizations. Thirty variants were identified in 18 of those genes as possibly associated with drug response, five of them in gene DCHS2. Other polymorphisms in this gene were also associated with hematological, biochemical and clinical parameters. Further research examining the maximum tolerated dose and fixed dose with a larger sample size is necessary to corroborate these findings.
36400537		The Development of Neuroimaging Biomarkers for Cognitive Decline in Sickle Cell Disease.Sickle cell disease (SCD) is complicated by neurologic complications including vasculopathy, hemorrhagic or ischemic overt stroke, silent cerebral infarcts and cognitive dysfunction. Patients with SCD, even in the absence of vasculopathy or stroke, have experience cognitive dysfunction that progresses with age. Transcranial Doppler ultrasound and structural brain MRI are currently used for primary and secondary stroke prevention, but laboratory or imaging biomarkers do not currently exist that are specific to the risk of cognitive dysfunction in patients with SCD. Recent investigations have used advanced MR sequences assessing cerebral hemodynamics, white matter microstructure and functional connectivity to better understand the pathophysiology of cognitive decline in SCD, with the long-term goal of developing neuroimaging biomarkers to be used in risk prediction algorithms and to assess the efficacy of treatment options for patients with SCD.
34555941		Health-Related Stigma, Social Support, Self-Efficacy, and Self-Care Actions Among Adults With Sickle Cell Disease in Oman.Stigma contributes to the burden of individuals and families affected by Sickle cell disease (SCD) and causes delay in appropriate care seeking. The aim of this study is to examine the levels and associations between stigma, social support, self-efficacy, and self-care actions among adult patients with SCD in Oman using a cross-sectional, correlational design. Of the 264 participants, 56.1% (n = 148) were males, with mean age of 30.1 years (SD 7.7). Half of the participants were married, and 88.3% had no other associated diseases. The results demonstrate that patients in Oman suffer from health-related stigma. However, social support, self-efficacy, and self-care actions were reported to be high and correlated with several clinical and demographic variables. Based on the results, effective, low-cost interventions such as psycho-educational groups, individual counseling, or group therapies might be developed. They can promote belief in enhanced efficacy and improved SCD adaptation, thereby increasing patient, and provider satisfaction.

Data on the effects of hydroxyurea taken for SCD during conception and pregnancy are scarce. The Sickle Cell Disease Implementation Consortium collected self-reported pregnancy history, corresponding hydroxyurea use, and pregnancy outcomes in women with SCD in the clinical setting. Among 1285 women 18-45 years of age, 737 (57.4%) reported 1788 pregnancies (1079 live births, 394 miscarriages, 40 stillbirths, 207 abortions, 48 current pregnancies, and 20 missing outcomes) of which 241 (15.9%) live births, miscarriages or stillbirths were conceived while on hydroxyurea. In univariate analyses, pregnancy number more than three, severe sickle genotype, history of stillbirth or miscarriage, and chronic kidney disease at enrollment were covariates significantly associated with a pregnancy ending in miscarriage or stillbirth. After adjustment for covariates and additional SCD severity markers in multivariate analyses, hydroxyurea use during conception and pregnancy, but not during conception only, was associated with an increase in the odds ratio (OR) of miscarriage or stillbirth (OR 2.21, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.40-3.47). In analyses of live birth outcomes, hydroxyurea use during conception and pregnancy was associated with birth weight < 5.5 pounds in full-term infants (OR 2.98, 95% CI 1.09-7.38) but not with prematurity or serious medical problems at birth. These findings suggest that hydroxyurea use may be safe up to the time of conception, but that clinicians should continue to advise caution regarding use during pregnancy.
36367374		Occult ischemic bone lesions in children with sickle cell disease: A study of prevalence.INTRODUCTION: Avascular necrosis (AVN) is a severe complication of sickle cell disease (SCD) and involves principally the femoral head. Few data exist about the prevalence of lesions in other segments. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 42 children (20 males and 22 females) underwent a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine, upper arms, and femurs. The primary outcome was to define the prevalence and locations of bone infarcts. RESULTS: Forty-two patients completed the study; the total median age was 11.9 years (interquartile range = 9.5-13.9). Eleven patients (26.2%) were positive for altered bone findings for a total of 32 lesions. Most of the lesions were in the humerus 17 (53.1%), 11 (34.4%) in the femurs, and 4 (12.5%) in the vertebrae. The median number of vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs) was two and four for patients without and with bone lesions, respectively (p = .01). The annual rate of VOC is the best marker for the positive MRI (odds ratio = 82.6; p = .03), and it is correlated with the number of sites involved (p = .02). CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights that the prevalence of skeletal lesions could be underestimated, and it provides the basis for clinical reasoning and tailored therapy in SCD children.

Serum cystatin C is a well-known marker of nephropathy in sickle cell disease (SCD) and beta-thalassemia patients that has recently emerged as a strong predictor of cardiovascular dysfunction in patients with and without kidney disease. We performed a case control study to determine the role of cystatin C as a predictor of subclinical cardiovascular dysfunction in SCD and beta-thalassemia patients. We enrolled 40 SCD patients with a mean age of 12.4 years, 40 beta-thalassemia patients with a mean age of 11.4 years and 40 age and sex-matched controls. We assessed hematological profile, serum ferritin, urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR), serum cystatin C, echocardiography and carotid intima media thickness (CIMT). UACR, cystatin C and CIMT were higher in SCD and beta-thalassemia patients compared to controls (p < .001). Significantly higher cystatin C levels were observed in SCD and beta-thalassemia patients with nephropathy or left ventricular systolic dysfunction (shortening fraction <30%, or ejection fraction <55%; p < .001). Moreover, SCD patients with pulmonary hypertension had significantly higher cystatin C levels. Cystatin C levels were positively correlated with CIMT in SCD (p = .02) and beta-thalassemia patients (p < .001) while negatively correlated with ejection fraction and shortening fraction (p < .001). The cutoff values of cystatin C >= 16.03 and >= 13.2 (ng/mL) could detect subclinical cardiac dysfunction risk among SCD and beta-thalassemia patients respectively. Cystatin C appears to be a promising marker for subclinical cardiovascular dysfunction in SCD and beta-thalassemia patients.
38323455		No increase in masked hypertension prevalence in children with sickle cell disease in France.OBJECTIVES: An important prevalence (32-45%) of masked hypertension has been reported in children with sickle cell disease (SCD). Systemic arterial rigidity has been associated with stroke in SCD. Stroke screening is well-established using transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound. The objectives of our proof-of-concept study in childhood SCD were to evaluate the prevalence of hypertension and its relationships with cerebral vasculopathy (TCD velocity) and to further evaluate in a subgroup of children the correlations of cardiovascular autonomic nervous system indices with TCD velocity. METHODS: Ambulatory blood pressure measurement (ABPM) and TCD velocity were obtained in children with SCD and in a restricted sample, cardiac sympathovagal balance using heart rate variability analyses, baroreflex sensitivity, and pulse wave velocity were measured. RESULTS: In 41 children with SCD (median age 14.0 years, 19 girls, SS/Sbeta+thalassemia/SC: 33/2/6), ABPM results showed masked hypertension in 2/41 (5%, 95% confidence interval, 0-11) children, consistent with the prevalence in the general pediatric population, elevated BP in 4/41 (10%) children, and a lack of a normal nocturnal dip in 19/41 children (46%). Children with increased TCD velocity had lower nocturnal dipping of systolic BP. In the 10 participants with extensive cardiovascular assessment, increased TCD velocity was associated with parasympathetic withdrawal and baroreflex failure. Exaggerated orthostatic pressor response or orthostatic hypertension was observed in 7/10 children that was linked to parasympathetic withdrawal. CONCLUSION: Autonomic nervous system dysfunction, namely loss of parasympathetic modulation, of SCD contributes to increase TCD velocity but is not associated with an increased prevalence of masked hypertension.
33742546		The comfort ability program for adolescents with sickle cell pain: Evaluating feasibility and acceptability of an inpatient group-based clinical implementation.BACKGROUND: Integration of nonpharmacological therapies, such as cognitive and behavioral pain management strategies, is recommended to support comprehensive disease and pain management among children and adolescents with sickle cell disease (SCD). The Comfort Ability Program for Sickle Cell Pain (CAP for SCP) introduces psychological and biobehavioral pain management strategies to children and adolescents with SCD. This study aimed to pilot the implementation of the CAP for SCP in a group setting to children and adolescents hospitalized for SCD pain examining feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness on improving pain knowledge and coping efficacy. METHOD: Adaptation of CAP for SCP into a three-session group format was guided by four phases of the Dynamic Adaptation Process model: Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, and Sustainment. Youth with SCD (n = 57) hospitalized for pain participated in at least one session and completed self-report of knowledge of pain management skills, pain coping efficacy, and treatment acceptance. Completion rates of sessions and qualitative feedback were gathered to evaluate feasibility and acceptability. RESULTS: Feasibility of conducting inpatient group sessions was suboptimal; however, patients and medical providers reported moderate to high levels of treatment acceptance. Patients also reported significant improvements in knowledge of pain management skills following session 1. CONCLUSIONS: CAP for SCP is a patient-centered first-line psychoeducational intervention that can be integrated into clinical practice settings to introduce youth to cognitive and behavioral pain management strategies to support SCD pain management.
34550539		Red blood cell exchange in children with sickle cell disease.The aim of our study was to assess the efficacy of red blood cell exchange (RBCx) using a Spectra Optia  automated apheresis system in children with sickle cell disease (SCD). We used automated RBCx to treat acute and chronic complications in 75 children with SCD who had a median age of 10 years [7-13]. We analyzed 649 RBCx sessions. Peripheral venous access was limited in a number of the children, and thus a femoral double-lumen central venous catheter was required. We recommend heparin locking with 500 units in each lumen of the catheter. To prevent complications, we ensured that all patients had achieved a post-RCE HbS level of < 30%. For chronic transfusion, with a post-RCE Hb level of approximately 10-11 g/dL, a blood exchange volume of >= 32 mL/kg, and an interval between each RBCx procedure of <= 30 days, the residual HbS level was maintained below 30%. For acute transfusion, a post-exchange Hb level >= 10 g/dL (p < 0.001) and a total exchange volume >= 35 mL/kg (p = 0.001) were the best way to reduce HbS to < 30%. AUC was 0.84. Our results show that erythrocytapheresis was useful and safe for children with SCD.
35691534		Distribution of Emergency Department Encounters and Subsequent Hospital Admissions for Children by Child Opportunity Index.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate differences in emergency department (ED) utilization and subsequent admission among children by Child Opportunity Index (COI). METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study of pediatric (<18 years) encounters to 194 EDs in Illinois from 2016 to 2020. Each encounter was assigned to quntiles of COI 2.0 by postal code. We described the difference in the percent of encounters between lower (Very Low and Low) and higher (Very High and High) COI overall and among diagnoses with overrepresentation from lower COI groups. We evaluated the association of diagnosis with COI in ordinal models adjusted for demographics. RESULTS: There were 4,653,026 eligible ED encounters classified by COI as Very Low (28.6%), Low (24.8%), Moderate (20.3%), High (15.6%), and Very High (10.8%) (difference between low and high COI encounters 27.0%). Diagnoses with the greatest difference between low and high COI were eye infection, upper respiratory tract infections, and cough. The COI distribution for children admitted from the ED (n = 140,298) was 29.1% Very Low, 19.3% Low, 18.2% Moderate, 17.7% High, and 15.7% Very High (percent difference 15.1%). Diagnoses with the greatest differences between low and high COI among admitted patients were sickle cell crisis, asthma, and influenza. All ED diagnoses and 7/12 admission diagnoses were associated with lower COI in multivariable ordinal models. CONCLUSIONS: Children from lower COI areas are overrepresented in ED and inpatient encounters overall and within certain diagnosis groups. Further research is required to examine how health outcomes may be influenced by the structural and contextual characteristics of a child's neighborhood.
34119338		Women with sickle cell disease report low knowledge and use of long acting reversible contraception.BACKGROUND: High rates of unplanned pregnancy and low rates of contraception use are reported among women with sickle cell disease (SCD). Pregnancy in women with SCD is high risk and unintended pregnancies limit opportunities to provide indicated preconception care and counseling. Contraceptive use in women with SCD is complicated by a lack of disease-specific data about treatment risks and benefits. The purpose of this study was to describe, for the first time in the U.S. context, contraceptive use, knowledge and preferences in adult cohort of women with SCD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A single-center survey study of women with SCD of reproductive age from our Center's adult and pediatric sickle cell centers. RESULTS: Seventy-eight women ages 28-65 years (median 33.5 years, IQR 16) completed surveys. Seventy-three percent of respondents had an average of 2.5 pregnancies (S.D. 1.22) and of these, 58% reported being pregnant when they did not want to be pregnant at least once. The most common forms of contraception used were condoms (87%), birth control pills (46%), medroxyprogesterone (44%) and withdrawal (44%). Twenty-two percent of subjects reported using a long-acting reversible form of contraception and 21% reported a tubal ligation or partner vasectomy. Respondents demonstrated low knowledge of the efficacy of contraceptive options and over-estimated the risk of pregnancy with the IUD, implant. Contraceptive priorities included pregnancy prevention, decreasing HIV transmission and effects on SCD symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Women with SCD have high rates of unintended pregnancy, low knowledge of contraceptive efficacy and low use of long-acting reversible contraception.
38262104		Effect of voxelotor on murine bone marrow and peripheral blood with hematopoietic progenitor cell mobilization for gene therapy of sickle cell disease.In preparation for hematopoietic stem cell mobilization and collection, current ex vivo gene therapy protocols for sickle cell disease require patients to undergo several months of chronic red cell transfusion. For health care equity, alternatives to red cell transfusion should be available. We examined whether treatment with GBT1118, the murine analog of voxelotor, could be a safe and feasible alternative to red cell transfusion. We found that 3 weeks of treatment with GBT1118 increased the percentage of bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells and upon plerixafor mobilization, the percentage of peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cells. Our data suggest that voxelotor should be further explored for its potential safety and utility as preparation for hematopoietic stem cell mobilization and collection.

35133406		GRNDaD: big data and sickle cell disease.Big data are used in the pursuit of precision medicine in the general population. Applying these tools to patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) is essential for ensuring that they receive the most appropriate customized therapy for their disease. For these tools to be applied, there must be a large number of willing, fully phenotyped participants in collaborative registries. Working collaboratively to respond to unmet clinical needs and the lack of a large multisite registry, SCD providers at multiple sites developed The Globin Regional Data and Discovery (GRNDaD) registry. The specific goals of GRNDaD are to (1) prospectively obtain high-quality curated data on the evolving population affected by SCD; (2) improve adherence to guideline-based care; (3) provide a platform for ongoing quality improvement across sites; (4) allow for real-time investigation of therapies, and collaborate broadly to address research questions using GRNDaD as a shared platform. GRNDaD's current strength lies in the generous participation of people living with SCD, collaborative investigators, and the opportunity to conduct quality improvement activities across a large number of sites. GRNDaD will serve as the data collection tool for the Health Resources and Services Administration Sickle Cell Treatment Demonstration Program and for the newly established National Alliance for Sickle Cell Centers (https://www.sicklecellcenters.org/). GRNDaD is a robust collaborative registry that providers and researchers will use to identify genetic markers that will help predict outcomes and lead to a better understanding of the natural history of SCD in the modern era of novel therapies.
35857826		Improving the diagnosis of severe malaria in African children using platelet counts and plasma PfHRP2 concentrations.Severe malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum is difficult to diagnose accurately in children in high-transmission settings. Using data from 2649 pediatric and adult patients enrolled in four studies of severe illness in three countries (Bangladesh, Kenya, and Uganda), we fitted Bayesian latent class models using two diagnostic markers: the platelet count and the plasma concentration of P. falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2). In severely ill patients with clinical features consistent with severe malaria, the combination of a platelet count of <=150,000/mul and a plasma PfHRP2 concentration of >=1000 ng/ml had an estimated sensitivity of 74% and specificity of 93% in identifying severe falciparum malaria. Compared with misdiagnosed children, pediatric patients with true severe malaria had higher parasite densities, lower hematocrits, lower rates of invasive bacterial disease, and a lower prevalence of both sickle cell trait and sickle cell anemia. We estimate that one-third of the children enrolled into clinical studies of severe malaria in high-transmission settings in Africa had another cause of their severe illness.

Vaso-occlusion and chronic hemolysis lead to dysfunction to vital organ systems, with the kidneys being among the most commonly affected organs. SUMMARY: Early renal manifestations include medullary ischemia with loss of urine concentrating ability and hyperfiltration. This can be followed by progressive damage characterized by persistent albuminuria and a decline in the estimated glomerular filtration rate. The risk of sickle nephropathy is greater in those with the APOL1 G1 and G2 kidney risk variants and variants in HMOX1 and lower in those that co-inherit alpha-thalassemia. Therapies to treat sickle cell disease-related kidney damage focus on sickle cell disease modifying therapies (e.g. hydroxyurea) or those adopted from the non-sickle cell disease kidney literature (e.g. renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors), although data on their clinical efficacy are limited to small studies with short follow up periods. Kidney transplantation for end-stage kidney disease improves survival compared to hemodialysis but is underutilized in this patient population. KEY MESSAGES: Kidney disease is a major contributor to early mortality and more research is needed to understand the pathophysiology and to develop targeted therapies to improve kidney health in sickle cell disease.
37204194		Case Ascertainment of Sickle Cell Disease Using Surveillance or Single Administrative Database Case Definitions.OBJECTIVE: In the absence of access to surveillance system data, single-source administrative databases are often used to study health care utilization and health outcomes among people with sickle cell disease (SCD). We compared the case definitions from single-source administrative databases with a surveillance case definition to identify people with SCD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used data from Sickle Cell Data Collection programs in California and Georgia (2016-2018). The surveillance case definition for SCD developed for the Sickle Cell Data Collection programs uses multiple databases, including newborn screening, discharge databases, state Medicaid programs, vital records, and clinic data. Case definitions for SCD in single-source administrative databases varied by database (Medicaid and discharge) and years of data (1, 2, and 3 years). We calculated the proportion of people meeting the surveillance case definition for SCD that was captured by each single administrative database case definition for SCD, by birth cohort, sex, and Medicaid enrollment. RESULTS: In California, 7117 people met the surveillance case definition of SCD from 2016 through 2018; 48% of this group was captured by the Medicaid case definition and 41% by the discharge case definition. In Georgia, 10 448 people met the surveillance case definition of SCD from 2016 through 2018; 45% of this group was captured by the Medicaid case definition and 51% by the discharge case definition. These proportions differed by years of data, birth cohort, and length of Medicaid enrollment. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: The surveillance case definition identified twice as many people with SCD as the single-source administrative database definitions during the same period, but trade-offs exist in using single administrative databases for decisions on policy and program expansion for SCD.
36992407		Viral Vectors in Gene Therapy: Where Do We Stand in 2023?Viral vectors have been used for a broad spectrum of gene therapy for both acute and chronic diseases. In the context of cancer gene therapy, viral vectors expressing anti-tumor, toxic, suicide and immunostimulatory genes, such as cytokines and chemokines, have been applied. Oncolytic viruses, which specifically replicate in and kill tumor cells, have provided tumor eradication, and even cure of cancers in animal models. In a broader meaning, vaccine development against infectious diseases and various cancers has been considered as a type of gene therapy. Especially in the case of COVID-19 vaccines, adenovirus-based vaccines such as ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and Ad26.COV2.S have demonstrated excellent safety and vaccine efficacy in clinical trials, leading to Emergency Use Authorization in many countries. Viral vectors have shown great promise in the treatment of chronic diseases such as severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, beta-thalassemia, and sickle cell disease (SCD). Proof-of-concept has been established in preclinical studies in various animal models. Clinical gene therapy trials have confirmed good safety, tolerability, and therapeutic efficacy. Viral-based drugs have been approved for cancer, hematological, metabolic, neurological, and ophthalmological diseases as well as for vaccines. For example, the adenovirus-based drug Gendicine  for non-small-cell lung cancer, the reovirus-based drug Reolysin  for ovarian cancer, the oncolytic HSV T-VEC for melanoma, lentivirus-based treatment of ADA-SCID disease, and the rhabdovirus-based vaccine Ervebo against Ebola virus disease have been approved for human use.

35854420		An Integrative Review: The Evolution of Provider Knowledge, Attitudes, Perceptions and Perceived Barriers to Caring for Patients with Sickle Cell Disease 1970-Now.Approximately 100,000 Americans have sickle cell disease (SCD). In the USA, the majority of patients with SCD are of African descent. Due to persistent racial and ethnic disparities in healthcare in the USA, patients with SCD experience disproportionately more health inequities because of providers' implicit biases regarding patient race. Lack of access to health insurance, lack of transportation to healthcare providers, and inadequate provider knowledge contribute to the morbidity and mortality of patients with SCD. The purpose of this integrative review was to analyze and synthesize the literature on providers' knowledge, perceptions, beliefs, and attitudes toward patients with SCD. A modified (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) method was used to conduct a comprehensive review of the literature yielding 31 publications included in this review. Three connected, yet distinct areas of focus were identified: (1) providers' knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of patients with SCD; (2) providers' perceived or true barriers to caring for patients with SCD; and (3) interventions to improve providers' attitudes, perceptions, and care of patients with SCD. In each area of focus, research has evolved over time. Also included in this integrative review is a synthesis of measurement instruments used to assess provider knowledge, attitudes, perceptions, and perceived and true barriers to caring for patients with SCD. Adolescents with SCD who are transitioning from pediatric to adult care are at a particularly high risk for morbidity and mortality, so this review focused on the many opportunities that exist to advance the healthcare for young adults with SCD to improve patient outcomes later in life. This includes improving providers' knowledge, perceptions, beliefs, and attitudes, and lessening the real or perceived barriers to care for patients with SCD.
36383708	treat|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell ;treat|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Stroke	Underweight children over 5 years with sickle cell anemia are at risk for early mortality in a low-resource setting.Undernutrition is a risk factor for under 5 mortality and is also postulated to be a risk factor for mortality in older children and adults with sickle cell anemia. We tested the hypothesis that underweight (weight-for-age z-score <-1) is associated with mortality in children aged 5-12 years with sickle cell anemia. We performed a secondary analysis of participants in the Primary Prevention of Stroke in Children with Sickle Cell Disease in Nigeria trial, a double-blind, parallel-group randomized controlled trial for low-dose (n=109) or moderate-dose (n=111) hydroxyurea in children with abnormal transcranial Doppler velocities and a comparison group (n=211) of participants with non-elevated transcranial Doppler velocities in northern Nigeria (NCT02560935). Nutritional status was classified as underweight (weight-for-age z-score), stunting (height-for-age z-score), and wasting (body mass index z-score) using the World Health Organization growth reference. The mean weight-for-age z-score was lower in children who died during the study than in those who survived (-2.6 vs. -2.1, p=0.016). Otherwise, the baseline characteristics of children who died during the study were not significantly different from those who survived. A pooled analysis of participants demonstrated that a lower weight-for-age z-score was associated with an increased hazard of death (HR=0.580, p=0.004, 95%CI 0.399-0.843). Underweight participants (weight-for-age z-score <-1) had a greater probability of death during follow-up than those not underweight (p=0.043). Underweight status in school-aged children with sickle cell anemia is a previously unrecognized risk factor for early mortality in Nigeria and can be easily applied to screen children at risk for death.

With limited data available, this study analyzed the effectiveness of PCA vs intravenous push (IVP) hydromorphone for pain management of VOC. The primary objective was to determine whether PCA or IVP hydromorphone is more effective in controlling VOC pain determined by a reduction in mean absolute difference pain intensity (MPI) from baseline to discharge. This retrospective single-center study evaluated differences in outcomes between patients treated with PCA vs those treated with IVP hydromorphone for VOC during hospital admission. Those 18 years or older admitted with one of the following International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes were included: D57.0 (Hb-SS disease with crisis), D57.2 (sickle cell/Hb-C disease), and D57.4 (sickle cell thalassemia), and administered PCA or IVP hydromorphone. The observed difference in absolute pain scores were not statistically significant (p = 0.753). The use of IVP hydromorphone resulted in a significant reduction in length of stay (LOS) and morphine milligram equivalent (MME) use compared to PCA, but was associated with a numerical increase in treatment failures. This study was limited by its retrospective nature, uneven distribution of groups, and only reviewed use of IVP and PCA hydromorphone at one institution.
34329381	associate|@GENE_RELA|@GENE_TLR4	Murine bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells have reduced hematopoietic maintenance ability in sickle cell disease.Sickle cell disease (SCD) is characterized by hemolytic anemia, which can trigger oxidative stress, inflammation, and tissue injury that contribute to disease complications. Bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) tightly regulate hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) homeostasis in health and disease, but their functionality in SCD remains unclear. We identified for the first time that murine SCD MSCs have altered gene signatures, reduced stem cell properties, and increased oxidative stress, due in part to hemolysis. Murine SCD MSCs had lower HSC maintenance ability in vitro and in vivo, as manifested by increased HSC mobilization and decreased HSC engraftment after transplant. Activation of Toll-like receptor-4 through p65 in MSCs further contributed to MSC dysfunction. Transfusions led to an improved MSC and HSC oxidative state in SCD mice. Improving the regulation between MSCs and HSCs has vital implications for enhancing clinical HSC transplantation and gene therapy outcomes and for identification of new molecular targets for alleviating SCD complications.
36774398	associate|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell|@GENE_BDNF ;stimulate|@DISEASE_Stroke|@GENE_BDNF	Brain-derived neurotrophic factor and neuroimaging in pediatric patients with sickle cell disease.BACKGROUND: The risk of neurological complications is increased in children with sickle cell disease (SCD), such as silent cerebral infarction (SCI) and stroke. Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) is a nerve growth factor associated with elevated transcranial Doppler (TCD) velocities and increased risk of stroke in SCD patients. So, we assessed the BDNF level in children with SCD and its relation to neurological complication as silent stroke. METHODS: A comparative cross-sectional study was conducted on 40 patients with SCD, recruited from the Hematology Unit, Pediatric Department, Menoufia University Hospital, and 40 healthy children as controls. Laboratory investigations including BDNF were done. TCD was done for all patients and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was done on high-risk patients. RESULTS: BDNF levels were significantly higher in children with SCD than in controls with a significant relation to TCD findings. There was a statistically significant diagnostic ability of BDNF in the prediction of SCD complications as its sensitivity was 89.5%, specificity (95% CI) was 80% with a cut-off point >0.69, AUC = 0.702, and p = 0.004). CONCLUSION: Serum BDNF levels were higher in sickle disease patients who had abnormal transcranial Doppler. BDNF had a significant diagnostic ability in the detection of SCD complications. IMPACT: Silent stroke is a very serious complication in children with sickle cell disease, so regular follow up should be every six months. BDNF is considered a potential biomarker for stroke risk prediction in patients unable to receive TCD.
34524455		Executive Functioning Predicts Adaptive Functioning and Self-Care Independence in Pediatric Sickle Cell Disease.OBJECTIVE: This study examined the impact of executive functioning (EF) on adaptive functioning and self-care independence in pre-transition youth with sickle cell disease (SCD). METHODS: Thirty-four youth with SCD (ages 12-18 years) completed a brief neuropsychological battery and their caregivers completed questionnaires assessing adaptive functioning, EF behaviors, and independence in completing self-care tasks, including disease management. Hierarchical linear regression analyses were utilized to investigate if EF predicted significantly more variability in adaptive functioning and self-care independence than what is accounted for by socioeconomic status (SES), disease knowledge, and estimated intellectual functioning. RESULTS: Mean performance on standardized measures assessing working memory, processing speed, and EF skills fell in the low average range. Performance-based EF and caregiver-reported EF behaviors predicted variance in adaptive functioning and self-care independence above and beyond that accounted for by SES, disease knowledge, and intelligence, with moderate to large effect sizes. CONCLUSIONS: EF skills may support the ability of youth with SCD to adequately achieve independence in self-care, including medical self-care, and other adaptive skills, which may increase the likelihood of successful transition to young adulthood. These findings provide support for the role of neuropsychological screening and individualized intervention in interdisciplinary transition programs.
34115136	cause|@CHEMICAL_Busulfan|@DISEASE_Leukemia	Leukemia after gene therapy for sickle cell disease: insertional mutagenesis, busulfan, both, or neither.Recently, encouraging data provided long-awaited hope for gene therapy as a cure for sickle cell disease (SCD). Nevertheless, the transient suspension of the bluebird bio gene therapy trial (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02140554) after participants developed acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome (AML/MDS) raised concerns. Potential possibilities for these cases include busulfan, insertional mutagenesis, both, or neither. Busulfan was considered the cause in the first reported case because the transgene was not present in the AML/MDS. However, busulfan is unlikely to have contributed to the most recent case. The transgene was present in the patient's malignant cells, indicating they were infused after busulfan treatment. Several lines of evidence suggest an alternative explanation for events in the bluebird bio trial, including that SCD population studies show an increased relative, but a low absolute, risk of AML/MDS. We propose a new hypothesis: after gene therapy for SCD, the stress of switching from homeostatic to regenerative hematopoiesis by transplanted cells drives clonal expansion and leukemogenic transformation of preexisting premalignant clones, eventually resulting in AML/MDS. Evidence validating our hypothesis will support prescreening individuals with SCD for preleukemic progenitors before gene therapy. While presumed viable, safe strategy has been implemented to resume gene therapy in adults with severe SCD, reasonable alternative curative therapy should be considered for children and adults with severe SCD. Currently, open multicenter clinical trials are incorporating nonmyeloablative conditioning, related haploidentical donors, and posttransplantation cyclophosphamide. Preliminary results from these trials appear promising, and National Institutes of Health-sponsored trials are ongoing in individuals with SCD using this platform.
37043417		Femoral Head Core Decompression and Bone Marrow Concentrate Injection in Pediatric Sickle-cell Related Avascular Necrosis.BACKGROUND: Femoral head avascular necrosis affects 10% to 40% of patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the results of femoral head core decompression and bone marrow aspirate concentrate (CD-BMAC) injection in pediatric patients with SCD. METHODS: Eligible patients were enrolled in this retrospective study of patients undergoing CD-BMAC. Patients with SCD who were younger than 18 at the time of surgery and had >1 year of follow-up were included in this analysis. Hips were staged based on the Ficat system by 2 raters. The visual analog score for pain, hip outcome score, modified Harris hip score, and the University of California, Los Angeles activity score were used as patient-reported outcome measures preoperatively, at 5 to 9 months postoperatively, and final follow-up. Treatment failure was defined as total hip arthroplasty or visual analog score >3 at the final follow-up. RESULTS: Twenty-three hips in 17 patients were included, with a median age at the time of surgery of 15.8 years (interquartile range: 13.1 to 17.8 y). Patients were followed for 4.25 +- 1.7 years. Ten hips showed a 1-stage increase in the Ficat stage at the final follow-up, whereas 11 retained the same stage, and 1 hip had a 1-stage regression. All patient-reported outcome measures showed significant improvement from the preoperative visit to short-term follow-up, but the preoperative to final follow-up improvement was not significant. Six treatment failures were recorded, including 3 total hip arthroplasties and 3 painful hips at the final follow-up. In a multivariate logistic regression model, only skeletal maturity (odds ratio = 16.2, 95% CI: 1.44-183.0, P = 0.024) and femoral head collapse (odds ratio = 12.0, 95% CI: 1.1-130.5, P = 0.041) were significant predictors of treatment failure. CONCLUSIONS: In the largest study on pediatric SCD patients undergoing CD-BMAC, we found that CD-BMAC injection offers significant improvement in pain and functional outcomes in the short term, with a very low risk for complications. Skeletal maturity and femoral head collapse were significant predictors of treatment failure. Patients with a collapsed femoral head experienced functional deterioration over time after initial improvement, whereas precollapse hips maintained their functional improvement up to the latest follow-up. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, retrospective cohort study.
34238888		Binasal Visual Field Defects Due to Sickle Cell Maculopathy.ABSTRACT: A 26-year-old African American man with sickle cell disease noticed blurry vision in both eyes after a recent complicated hospital admission for sickle cell crisis. Anterior and posterior segment examination of each eye was normal, but visual field testing revealed binasal scotomas. Optical coherence tomography of the macula demonstrated severe thinning of the temporal inner retina, suggesting previous bilateral occlusions of terminal retinal arterioles involving the temporal macula, an uncommon complication of sickle cell disease. This case is a reminder that retinal pathology should always be considered as a potential cause of unexplained visual field defects and highlights the role of macular OCT in evaluation of these patients.
33724440		Prophylactic antibiotics for preventing pneumococcal infection in children with sickle cell disease.BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of inherited disorders that result in haemoglobin abnormalities and other complications. Injury to the spleen, among other factors, contribute to persons with SCD being particularly susceptible to infection. Infants and very young children are especially vulnerable. The 'Co-operative Study of Sickle Cell Disease' observed an incidence rate for pneumococcal septicaemia of 10 per 100 person-years in children under the age of three years. Vaccines, including customary pneumococcal vaccines, may be of limited use in this age group. Therefore, prophylactic penicillin regimens may be advisable for this population. This is an update of a Cochrane Review which was first published in 2002, and previously updated, most recently in 2017.  OBJECTIVES: To compare the effects of antibiotic prophylaxis against pneumococcus in children with SCD receiving antibiotic prophylaxis compared to those without in relation to: 1. incidence of Streptococcus pneumoniae infection; 2. mortality (as reported in the included studies); 3. drug-related adverse events (as reported in the included studies) to the individual and the community; 4. the impact of discontinuing at various ages on incidence of infection and mortality. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, which is comprised of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and also two clinical trials registries: ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Registry Platform (not in 2020 given access issues relating to Covid-19 pandemic). Additionally, we carried out hand searching of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of the most recent search: 25 January 2021. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing prophylactic antibiotics to prevent pneumococcal infection in children with SCD with placebo, no treatment or a comparator drug. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane were used. Both authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. The authors used the GRADE criteria to assess the certainty of the evidence. MAIN RESULTS: Six trials were identified by the searches, of which three trials were eligible for inclusion. A total of 880 children, who were between three months to five years of age at randomization were included. The included studies were conducted in centres in the USA and in Kingston, Jamaica. In trials that investigated initiation of penicillin on risk of pneumococcal infection, the odds ratio was 0.37 (95% confidence interval 0.16 to 0.86) (two trials, 457 children) (low-certainty evidence), while for withdrawal the odds ratio was 0.49 (95% confidence interval 0.09 to 2.71) (one trial, 400 children) (low-certainty evidence). Adverse drug effects were rare and minor. Rates of pneumococcal infection were found to be relatively low in children over the age of five years. Overall, the certainty of the evidence for all outcomes was judged to be low. The results from the risk of bias assessment undertaken identified two domains in which the risk of bias was considered to be high, these were incomplete outcome data (attrition bias) (two trials) and allocation concealment (selection bias) (one trial). Domains considered to have a low risk of bias for all three trials were selective reporting (reporting bias) and blinding (performance and detection bias). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The evidence examined was determined to be of low certainty and suggests that prophylactic penicillin significantly reduces risk of pneumococcal infection in children with homozygous SCD, and is associated with minimal adverse reactions. Further research may help to determine the ideal age to safely withdraw penicillin.

In addition to similarities between the signs and symptoms in sickle cell nephropathy and ADPKD, more than half of SCD patients have kidney cysts. The co-occurrence of these two diseases has not been previously reported in the literature. CASE DIAGNOSIS/TREATMENT: A 16-year-old Black male with SCD had bilateral kidney enlargement and multiple simple cysts on ultrasound. Although kidney cysts are significantly more common in individuals affected with SCD, genetic testing with a broad kidney gene panel was performed to explore the possible presence of another underlying genetic cause of his cysts, in addition to SCD. A dual diagnosis of SCD and ADPKD was made following the identification of two copies of the common pathogenic sickle cell HBB variant (c.20A > T, p.Glu7Val) and a pathogenic missense variant in PKD1 (c.8311G > A, p.Glu2771Lys). CONCLUSIONS: SCD and ADPKD differ in pathophysiological mechanisms and treatment regimens. As such, it will be paramount for this teenager to be closely monitored for signs of diminished kidney function and to be co-managed as he transitions to adult care to ensure proper treatment and management. Early identification of individuals with both SCD and a co-occurring condition is crucial to ensuring proper clinical management. Furthermore, identifying and reporting additional patients with SCD and ADPKD dual diagnoses will help us to understand the co-occurring disease course and optimal treatments.
35180764		Assessment of Liver Fibrosis by Transient Elastography in Children and Young Adults With Sickle Cell Disease With and Without Iron Overload.Transfusion-associated iron overload may cause liver fibrosis. We compared transient elastography (TE) and aspartate aminotransferase-platelet ratio index (APRI), noninvasive markers for hepatic fibrosis, to liver histology in children and young adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) who were iron overloaded (cohort 1). Age-matched subjects with SCD but without iron overload (cohort 2) were enrolled for APRI and TE assessments. Nineteen subjects ages 10 to 21 years were transfused for a mean of 9.67 years, had a mean serum ferritin of 4899+-2849 ng/mL, and a liver iron concentration of 15.56+-10.12 mg/g dry liver weight by R2-magnetic resonance imaging. Mean APRI was 0.33+-0.13 in cohort 1 and 0.27+-0.10 in cohort 2. The mean liver stiffness measures (LSM) in cohort 1, assessed by TE, was 8.46+-3.95 kPa, ranging from 3.5 to 14.6 kPa (expected normal <7 kPa). Cohort 2 had a mean LSM of 5.72+-1.74 kPa (4.6 to 8.7 kPa). There was a good correlation between LSM and histologic fibrosis (t value 6.94, P<0.0001). There was no significant correlation between APRI and histologic fibrosis and between APRI and LSM. A high LSM suggests liver fibrosis in children and adults with SCD with iron overload and may merit histologic confirmation especially if persistent.
35339238		Considerations When Aggregating Data to Measure Performance Across Levels of the Health Care System.BACKGROUND: Measuring quality at varying levels of the health care system requires attribution, a process of determining the patients and services for which each level is responsible. However, it is important to ensure that attribution approaches are equitable; otherwise, individuals may be assigned differentially based upon social determinants of health. METHODS: First, we used Medicaid claims (2010-2018) from Michigan to assess the proportion of children with sickle cell anemia who had less than 12 months enrollment within a single Medicaid health plan and could therefore not be attributed to a specific health plan. Second, we used the Medicaid Analytic eXtract data (2008-2009) from 26 states to simulate adapting the 30-Day Pediatric All-Condition Readmission measure to the Accountable Care Organization (ACO) level and examined the proportion of readmissions that could not be attributed. RESULTS: For the sickle cell measure, an average of 300 children with sickle cell anemia were enrolled in Michigan Medicaid each year. The proportion of children that could not be attributed to a Medicaid health plan ranged from 12.2% to 89.0% across years. For the readmissions measure, of the 1,051,365 index admissions, 22% were excluded in the ACO-level analysis because of being unable to attribute the patient to a health plan for the 30 days post discharge. CONCLUSIONS: When applying attribution models, it is essential to consider the potential to induce health disparities. Differential attribution may have unintentional consequences that deepen health disparities, particularly when considering incentive programs for health plans to improve the quality of care.

33625076		Association of Anemia and Blood Pressure With Novel Markers of Diastolic Function in Pediatric Sickle Cell Disease.Diastolic dysfunction is a known cause of mortality in adults with sickle cell disease (SCD). Left atrial function (LAf) and strain (LAS) are novel echocardiographic parameters to assess early diastolic dysfunction, which have not been assessed in pediatric SCD. Through a retrospective single-center study, we describe echocardiographic parameters of diastology in children with SCD and evaluate their relationship with clinical variables including anemia and blood pressure. Baseline clinical data, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring data and echocardiography results were collected. LAf and LAS were measured using volumetric data and speckle-tracking echocardiography, respectively. Sixty-seven children with SCD (13.5+-7 y, 47% male, 7% hypertensive) with a mean hemoglobin of 8.8+-1.3 g/dL, LAf of 61+-8% (n=53) and LAS of 46.3+-7.4% (n=28) were included. LAS was significantly associated with hemoglobin (rho=0.43, P=0.022) but not with maximal left atrial (LA) volume (rho=-0.05, P=0.79) or any blood pressure parameters. On multivariate analysis, LAS decreased by 3.2% (1.3, 5.1) and LA volume increased by 1.6 mL/m2 (3.1, 0.08) for every 1 g/dL decrease in hemoglobin. Thus, severity of baseline anemia in pediatric SCD correlates with diastolic function as measured by LAS, independent of LA dilation.
33792218		Red cell transfusion and alloimmunization in sickle cell disease.Red cell transfusion remains a critical component of care for acute and chronic complications of sickle cell disease. Randomized clinical trials demonstrated the benefits of transfusion therapy for prevention of primary and secondary strokes and postoperative acute chest syndrome. Transfusion for splenic sequestration, acute chest syndrome, and acute stroke are guided by expert consensus recommendations. Despite overall improvements in blood inventory safety, adverse effects of transfusion are prevalent among patients with sickle cell disease and include alloimmunization, acute and delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions, and iron overload. Judicious use of red cell transfusions, optimization of red cell antigen matching, and the use of erythrocytapheresis and iron chelation can minimize adverse effects. Early recognition and management of hemolytic transfusion reactions can avert poor clinical outcomes. In this review, we discuss transfusion methods, indications, and complications in sickle cell disease with an emphasis on alloimmunization.

However, the accuracy of RDTs for malaria diagnosis in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) is unknown. METHODS: We compared the performance of a histidine rich protein 2 (HRP-2)-based RDT (First Response) and a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)-based RDT (Optimal) with routine microscopy as reference standard in 445 children with SCD and an acute febrile illness in Accra, Ghana. RESULTS: The overall sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the HRP-2-based RDTs were 100%, 95.7%, 73.8%, and 100%, respectively. Comparable values for the LDH-based RDTs were 91.7%, 99.5%, 95.7%, and 99.0%, respectively. A total of 423 results were true in both tests, 1 result was false in both tests, 16 results were false in the HRP-2 test only, and 5 were false in the LDH test only (McNemar test, P = .03). At follow-up, 73.7% (28/38), 52.6% (20/38), 48.6% (17/35), and 13.2% (5/38) of study participants were HRP-2 positive on days 14, 28, 35, and 42, respectively, compared with 0%, 2.6% (1/38), 2.9% (1/35), and 2.6% (1/38) for LDH. CONCLUSION: The HRP2-based RDT fulfilled World Health Organization criteria for malaria diagnosis in patients with SCD and may provide diagnostic evidence for treatment to begin in cases in which treatment would otherwise have begun presumptively based on symptoms, whereas LDH-based RDTs may be more suitable as a confirmatory test in low-parasitemic subgroups, such as patients with SCD.

We present a patient with SCD with gradual onset of a severe headache and visual changes. Brain magnetic resonance imaging, angiography, and venography were nondiagnostic. Lumbar puncture established a diagnosis of IIH, and the patient had rapid improvement with large-volume lumbar puncture and acetazolamide. To our knowledge, this is the first case of IIH in a nonobese adult with SCD taking hydroxyurea, suggesting an association between SCD or hydroxyurea use and IIH. Furthermore, her clinical course demonstrates the complexities of treating IIH in patients with SCD.
33798750		Fluorescence spectroscopy as a novel technique for premarital screening of sickle cell disorders.Spectral diagnostic screening for sickle cell disease was carried out on volunteer blood samples (N = 100). The samples were subjected to different diagnostic methods including conventional complete blood count (CBC), hemoglobin electrophoresis (HBE) and spectral diagnosis. For the spectral diagnostic method, we discriminated three different characteristic spectral features. In total, 15 samples were sickle cell trait (SCT), 34 samples were sickle cell disease (SCD), and the rest of the samples (N = 51) were normal controls. The spectral discrimination of the three different sets of samples was distinguished on the quantification of fluorescent biomolecules such as tyrosine, tryptophan, NADH, FAD, and porphyrins. The results were compared with the conventional standard CBC and capillary electrophoresis findings. The spectral diagnosis method exhibited a sensitivity and specificity greater than 90 % for the tested samples. This technique requires only 5 mL blood samples, has an analysis time of 20 min, exhibits high accuracy and may be used in small clinics in remote villages.
38066847		Managing pregnancy in patients with sickle cell disease from a transfusion perspective.Advances in the management of sickle cell disease (SCD) have made it possible for most female patients (whether homozygous or compound heterozygous) to reach childbearing age and become pregnant. However, even in the less symptomatic forms of SCD a high risk of complications during pregnancy and the postpartum period can occur for both the mother (1% to 2% mortality) and the fetus. Coordinated care from the obstetrician and the sickle cell disease expert is essential, together with the active participation of the patient. Vaso-occlusive complications, such as vaso-occlusive crisis and acute chest syndrome, often increase in frequency when hydroxyurea treatment is interrupted. Obstetric complications, such as pre-eclampsia, fetal growth restriction, and preterm delivery, are more common in women with SCD. Recent meta-analysis-based studies support prophylactic transfusion. However, there have been no randomized trials assessing the benefits of prophylactic transfusion. Given the known risk of transfusion complications, including delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction and hyperhemolysis, transfusion is not systematically performed in pregnant women with SCD. We describe here a case-by-case approach to the management of pregnancy in women with SCD based on the medical and transfusion history of each patient.
34160085	associate|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell|@GENE_CD34	Process and procedural adjustments to improve CD34+ collection efficiency of hematopoietic progenitor cell collections in sickle cell disease.BACKGROUND: Adequate CD34+ collection efficiency (CE) is critical to achieve target CD34+ cell doses in hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) collections. Autologous HPC collection in sickle cell disease (SCD) is associated with unstable collection interfaces and low CD34+ CEs. We hypothesized that variables specific to SCD, activation of blood cells and elevated viscosity, might contribute to these issues and made adjustments to the collection process and procedure to address our hypothesis. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In two patients with SCD undergoing autologous HPC collection on our clinical trial (NCT02193191), we therefore implemented adjustments to the process and procedure in the following areas: proximity of RBC exchange to HPC collection, the type of anticoagulation, and the packing factor setting. RESULTS: There was no collection interface instability. Our CD34+ CE1s were high at 70% and 51%, and granulocyte CE, platelet CE, and product granulocyte % were remarkably low. Product hematocrits were not as high as previously reported to be required to obtain adequate CEs. Interestingly, one HPC product showed a hemoglobin S (HbS) of 91% at the same time that the peripheral blood (PB) showed a HbS of 22%. DISCUSSION: Adjustments to the HPC collection process and procedure were associated with adequate CD34+ CEs and low granulocyte and platelet contamination in HPC products from SCD patients. Given the discrepancy in the percentage of sickle RBCs in the product versus the PB, we hypothesize that CD34+ cells and RBCs may aggregate. Our interventions and hypothesis should be further investigated in larger studies.
34889368		Hematopoietic cell transplantation for sickle cell disease: updates and future directions.Excellent outcomes in hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) from HLA-identical siblings, improvements in conditioning regimens, novel graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis, and the availability of alternative donors have all contributed to the increased applicability and acceptability of HCT for sickle cell disease (SCD). In young children with symptomatic SCD with an available HLA-identical related donor, HCT should be carefully considered. HCT from alternative donors is typically undertaken only in patients with severe symptoms, causing or likely to cause organ damage, and in the context of clinical trials. Patients undergoing HCT for SCD require careful counseling and preparation. They require careful monitoring of unique organ toxicities and complications during HCT. Patients must be prospectively followed for a prolonged time to determine the long-term outcomes and late effects of HCT for SCD. Thus, there is a need for a universal, longitudinal clinical registry to follow patients after HCT for SCD in conjunction with individuals who do not receive HCT to compare outcomes. Antibody-based conditioning and ex-vivo umbilical cord blood expansion are likely to improve the availability and acceptability of HCT. In addition, new disease-modifying drugs and the emerging option of the autologous transplantation of gene-modified hematopoietic progenitor cells are likely to expand the available therapeutic options and make decision-making by patients, physicians, and caregivers even more complicated. Future efforts must also focus on determining the impact of socioeconomic status on access to and outcomes of HCT and the long-term impact of HCT on patients, families, and society.
37182559	associate|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell|@GENE_HBB	CRISPR/Cas9-based gene-editing technology for sickle cell disease.Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common monogenic hematologic disorder and is essentially congenital hemolytic anemia caused by an inherited point mutation in the beta-globin on chromosome 11. Although the genetic basis of SCD was revealed as early as 1957, treatment options for SCD have been very limited to date. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) was thought to hold promise as a cure for SCD, but the available donors were still only 15% useful. Gene therapy has advanced rapidly into the 21st century with the promise of a cure for SCD, and gene editing strategies based on the cluster-based regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat sequence (CRISPR)/Cas9 system have revolutionized the field of gene therapy by precisely targeting genes. In this paper, we review the pathogenesis and therapeutic approaches of SCD, briefly summarize the delivery strategies of CRISPR/Cas9, and finally discuss in depth the current status, application barriers, and solution directions of CRISPR/Cas9 in SCD. Through the review in this paper, we hope to provide some references for gene therapy in SCD.
33708318		Health insurance and the financial implications of sickle cell disease among parents of affected children attending a tertiary facility in Lagos, south-west Nigeria.INTRODUCTION: there is a paucity of data on the financial implications of sickle cell disease on households of affected children and their use of health insurance in Nigeria. This study assessed the awareness of health insurance, patterns of health service utilization and financial implications of sickle cell disease among children seeking care at a tertiary facility in Nigeria. METHODS: a structured questionnaire was administered to parents of 314 children with sickle cell disease attending the pediatric hematology unit of the Lagos University Teaching Hospital between May and December 2019. RESULTS: mean age of the children was 91.5 +- 43.1 months. M: F was 1.17: 1. 45.5% of households earned above NGN 150,000 (USD 417) monthly. 71.3% of the parents had heard of health insurance but only 20.7% were enrolled in a health insurance scheme. Awareness of health insurance was significantly associated with social class (p=0.000) and monthly household income (p=0.000). 60.8% of the parents preferred pre-facility treatment. Social class (p=0.01) and monthly household income (p=0.001) were significantly associated with home treatment. Time on admission ranged from 2-18 days with an average of 4.31 days. Average cost of hospitalization was USD 148 +- USD 14.2 and total cost of care incurred was USD 20,787. Neither age of child (p=0.857), estimated household income (p=0.863) nor social class (p=0.397) was associated with cost of care. CONCLUSION: a high cost of care was observed in our study population underscoring the need for increased awareness and access to health insurance for households of children with sickle cell disease.

There is a paucity of studies identifying potential genetic mechanisms of pain in this population. AIM: Examine associations between 11 functional single nucleotide polymorphisms in 9 candidate genes with reports of average pain intensity in individuals with sickle cell disease. METHOD: Cross-sectional analyses were performed on data and blood samples collected through the Duke SCD Implementation Consortium Registry. Participants were asked to rate their pain "on the average" using an 11-point numeric rating scale (0 = no pain; 10 = pain as bad as you can imagine). We genotyped 11 single nucleotide polymorphisms in 9 pain-related genes using TaqMan  Genotyping Assays. Associations between each polymorphism and reports of average pain were evaluated. RESULTS: The 86 participants (mean age: 28.7 years; 64% female) included in this study reported moderate pain on average (Mean = 4, Standard Deviation = 2.4). ICAM1 rs1799969 was the only genetic polymorphism that was significantly associated with pain (p = .01). Individuals with one or more minor alleles had lower average pain (Mean = 1.25, Standard Deviation = 1.50) than individuals without a minor allele (Mean = 4.13, Standard Deviation = 2.25). The effect size for ICAM1 rs1799969 was 1.30, which is considered large. The effect sizes for all other single nucleotide polymorphisms ranged from small to medium (range: 0-0.3). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide preliminary evidence that the minor allele in ICAM1 rs1799969 had protective effects against experiencing more severe pain in sickle cell disease.

Trial HGB-205 ( NCT02151526 ) aimed at evaluating gene therapy by autologous CD34+ cells transduced ex vivo with lentiviral vector BB305 that encodes the anti-sickling betaA-T87Q-globin expressed in the erythroid lineage. HGB-205 is a phase 1/2, open-label, single-arm, non-randomized interventional study of 2-year duration at a single center, followed by observation in long-term follow-up studies LTF-303 ( NCT02633943 ) and LTF-307 ( NCT04628585 ) for TDT and SCD, respectively. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were similar to those for allogeneic transplantation but restricted to patients lacking geno-identical, histocompatible donors. Four patients with TDT and three patients with SCD, ages 13-21 years, were treated after busulfan myeloablation 4.6-7.9 years ago, with a median follow-up of 4.5 years. Key primary endpoints included mortality, engraftment, replication-competent lentivirus and clonal dominance. No adverse events related to the drug product were observed. Clinical remission and remediation of biological hallmarks of the disease have been sustained in two of the three patients with SCD, and frequency of transfusions was reduced in the third. The patients with TDT are all transfusion free with improvement of dyserythropoiesis and iron overload.
36105789	treat|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Eye_Abnormalities ;treat|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell	The Impact of Optical Coherence Tomography in the Early Identification of Children with Sickle Cell Retinopathy.Introduction: Sickle cell disease is characterized by the production of abnormal hemoglobin, which affects hemoglobin molecule stability during hypoxia and leads to the formation of sickle cells, resulting in increased hematic viscosity, hemolysis, and microvascular blockage. Vasoocclusion is assumed to be the primary cause of vision-threatening retinopathy in sickle cell disease. The aim of this study was to improve the early detection of sickle cell retinopathy (SCR) in children with sickle cell disease (SCD) and investigate the link between systemic and ocular symptoms. Methods: This cross-sectional study comprised children with SCD. The patient files provided a detailed medical history. The laboratory tests included a blood count, reticulocyte count, and Hb electrophoresis. The slit lamp, fundus, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) were all part of the ophthalmological examination. Results: The study comprised 15 children with sickle cell disease who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria, with a mean age of 11.15 +- 1.29 years. Nine of the children were males (60%) and six were females (40%). 8 (53.3%) of the children had Hb SS, three (20%) had Hb SC, three (20%) had Hb SB+, and one (6.7%) had Hb SB0. Four children (26.7%) had poor visual acuity. A fundus examination revealed significant abnormal findings in 12 of the 7 children's eyes (40 percent). Macular thinning was detected by OCT in 10 eyes of 7 children (33.3%). Flow voids at the deep retinal capillary plexus were detected by OCTA in 10 eyes of 7 children (33.3%). Longer disease duration, higher reticulocytic percent, more painful crises, and noncompliance with hydroxyurea medication were all linked to the existence of eye abnormalities on fundus examination and OCT. Conclusion: OCTA can show early retinal damage in sickle cell patients with macular changes. Sickle cell retinopathy is usually associated with more severe disease.
37920880	associate|@CHEMICAL_Bicarbonates|@DISEASE_Acute_Kidney_Injury	Acute kidney injury is more common in hospitalised children with sickle cell anaemia in Africa.AIM: To document the prevalence, severity, hospital outcome and factors associated with acute kidney injury (AKI) in hospitalised children with sickle cell anaemia (SCA). METHODS: In this prospective observational study involving children aged 0.5-17 years with SCA requiring hospitalisation, we used serum creatinine level at 0 and 48 h of hospitalisation to determine the presence of AKI. RESULTS: The study involved 155 children with SCA aged 0.5-17 years with a median (interquartile range) age of 7.8 (4.3-11.0) years. Acute kidney injury occurred in 27 (17.4%) children with 33.3% reaching stage 3. Hepatomegaly (81.5% vs. 55.4%; p = 0.015), splenomegaly (33.3% vs. 10.9%; p = 0.003), dipstick proteinuria (22.2% vs. 5.4%; p = 0.004), and hematuria (29.6% vs. 3.1%; p = <0.001) were more common in those with AKI. In contrast, children with AKI had lower haematocrit (16.9% vs. 22.2%; p = <0.001) and serum bicarbonate (16.7 vs. 19.1 mmoL/L; p = 0.010) compared with those without AKI. Those with AKI had longer hospital stay (median [interquartile range]: 7 [4-12] days vs. 4 [3-6] days; p = 0.008). CONCLUSION: AKI is common among hospitalised children with AKI and is associated with longer hospital stay.
38279581		Decreasing alloimmunization-specific mortality in sickle cell disease in the United States: Cost-effectiveness of a shared transfusion resource.Red blood cell alloimmunization and consequent delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction (DHTR) incidence and mortality in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) are high. A shared transfusion resource has decreased both in other countries, while in the United States cost concerns persist. We conducted a Markov cohort simulation of a birth cohort of alloimmunized patients with SCD to estimate lifetime DHTR incidence, DHTR-specific mortality, quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE), and costs with the implementation of a shared transfusion resource to identify antibody history versus without (i.e., status quo). We conducted our analysis using a lifetime analytic time horizon and from a United States health system perspective. Implementation of shared transfusion resource projects to decrease cumulative DHTR-specific mortality by 26% for alloimmunized patients with SCD in the United States, relative to the status quo. For an average patient population of 32 000, this intervention would generate a discounted increment of 4000 QALYs at an incremental discounted cost of $0.3 billion, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $75 600/QALY [95% credible interval $70 200-81 400/QALY]. The results are most sensitive to the baseline lifetime medical expenditure of patients with SCD. Alloantibody data exchange is cost-effective in 100% of 10 000 Monte Carlo simulations. The resource would theoretically need a minimum patient population of 1819 patients or cost no more than $5.29 million annually to be cost-effective. By reducing DHTR-specific mortality, a shared transfusion resource in the United States projects to be a life-saving and cost-effective intervention for patients with SCD in the United States.

34766849		Prevalence of Dark without Pressure and Angioid Streaks in Sickle Cell Disease.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence of areas of dark without pressure (DWOP) and angioid streaks (AS) in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a consecutive series of 77 adults with SCD. RESULTS: DWOP appeared as multiple patches in 35 of the affected eyes and as a single lesion in 3 eyes. OCT finding demonstrated the ellipsoid layer was hyporeflective in DWOP. AS were identified in six cases (3.9%) and were bilateral in five cases. The prevalence of AS was higher with increasing age, being 67% in the patients older than age 45 years. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of DWOP in adults with SCD is 25% in this study, which is higher than previously reported, and the prevalence of AS is around 4%, which is midway between prior estimates. Recognition of the clinical examination and imaging features of DWOP reduce the need for additional investigation. [Ophthalmic Surg Lasers Imaging Retina. 2021;52:620-622.].

Compared to calcineurin inhibitors, sirolimus has no neurotoxicity or nephrotoxicity, but sirolimus causes dose-dependent thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, delayed wound healing, hyperlipidemia, and hypertriglyceridemia. Here we report a case of acute pancreatitis and diabetic ketoacidosis in a patient with sickle cell disease post haploidentical family donor HSCT which was managed conservatively without plasmapheresis. Based on our review of the literature, this is the first reported case of developing acute pancreatitis as an adverse effect of sirolimus-induced hypertriglyceridemia leading to diabetic ketoacidosis in a recipient of HSCT.
36054667		The significance of spleen size in children with sickle cell anemia.It is well established that splenic dysfunction occurs in early childhood in sickle cell anemia (SCA), although the determinants and consequences of splenic injury are not fully understood. In this study, we examined spleen size and splenic function in 100 children with SCA aged 0-16 years at King's College Hospital in London. Spleen size was assessed by abdominal ultrasound (US) and splenic function by pitted red blood cells (PIT counts). In our cohort, 5.6% of children aged 6-10 years and 19.4% of children aged 11-16 years had no visible spleen on US (autosplenectomy). Splenomegaly was common in all age groups, with 28% of children overall having larger spleens than the average for their age. Only one child had a PIT count suggesting preserved splenic function. We found no correlation between hemoglobin F levels and spleen size, nor was there any difference in spleen size between children treated with or without hydroxyurea. Although there was a trend toward increased spleen length in children with co-inherited alpha-thalassemia, this did not reach statistical significance. Finally, we found a strong association between erythrocyte deformability measured with oxygen gradient ektacytometry, spleen size, and PIT counts. In conclusion, our results do not agree with the general perception that most children with SCA undergo autosplenectomy within the first decade of life and indicate that loss of erythrocyte deformability contributes to loss of splenic filtration capacity in SCA, as well as phenotypical variations in spleen size.
34941149		Retinopathy in Egyptian patients with sickle cell disease: A cross-sectional study.ABSTRACT: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a disorder that causes red blood cells to become sticky and rigid. Sickle cells can block blood flow in small blood vessels depriving the eye of oxygen and cause damage. This is called sickle retinopathy that can progress to severe proliferative sickle cell retinopathy, bleeding into the eye, detachment of the retina or even loss of vision.To assess ocular manifestations and detect frequency of retinopathy in patients with SCD.Cross-sectional study was conducted on 32 patients with SCD. They were 22 males and 10 females with mean age of 12 years. Routine investigations as well as ophthalmological examination including visual acuity, fluorescein angiography and optical coherence tomography were done.We found that 8 patients (25%) suffered from proliferative retinopathy, 10 patients (31%) showed tortuous retinal veins, while 14 patients (44%) were normal. All patients showed macular thinning on optical coherence tomography examination.We concluded that frequency of retinopathy in patients with SCD is more than expected and it was higher in patients who started transfusion at a later age. More attention should be paid for this problem and close observations and follow up is strongly needed.
36994864		Efficacy of non-pharmacological interventions to reduce pain in children with sickle cell disease: A systematic review.BACKGROUND: Pain is the clinical hallmark of sickle cell disease (SCD) leading to hospitalization, psychological sequelae and a decreased health-related quality of life. The aim of this systematic literature review is to evaluate the efficacy of non-pharmacological interventions in reducing sickle cell related pain in children with SCD. METHODS: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines, a comprehensive literature search up until October 2022 was performed to identify studies that investigated the efficacy of non-pharmacological interventions on (1) pain frequency and/or intensity, and (2) analgesic and health service use in children with SCD until the age of 21. Both randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-experimental designed (QED) studies were considered for inclusion. RESULTS: Ten articles (five RCTs and five QED studies) with 422 participants were included. They investigated cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) (n = 5), biofeedback (n = 2), massage (n = 1), virtual reality (n = 1) and yoga (n = 1). The majority of the interventions were psychological (n = 7) and were performed in the outpatient clinic (n = 6). CBT and biofeedback significantly reduced frequency and/or intensity of SCD-related pain in outpatient settings, while virtual reality and yoga significantly reduced pain in inpatient settings. Biofeedback also significantly reduced analgesic use. None of the included articles reported reduced health service use. CONCLUSION: Non-pharmacological interventions may be effective in reducing pain in paediatric patients with SCD. However, due to the heterogeneity of the included studies a quantitative analysis could not be performed. Awaiting further supporting evidence, healthcare providers should consider implementing these interventions as valuable part of a comprehensive pain management strategy plan.
37023564		Cognitive-motor dual-task interference in adults with sickle cell disease.BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder that causes physical and cognitive impairment due to hemolysis, painful vaso-occlusion episodes, joint avascular necrosis, and strokes. As individuals with SCD age and develop conditions impacting their physical and cognitive function, their ability to multitask successfully and safely may decline. Cognitive-motor dual-task interference occurs when there is deterioration in one or both tasks while dual-tasking relative to single-tasking. Dual-task assessment (DTA) is a valuable measure of physical and cognitive function; however, there is limited data on DTA in adults with SCD. RESEARCH QUESTION: Is DTA a feasible and safe method of measuring physical and cognitive function in adults with SCD? What patterns of cognitive-motor interference occur in adults with SCD? METHODS: We enrolled 40 adults with SCD (mean age 44 years, range 20-71) in a single-center prospective cohort study. We used usual gait speed as the measure of motor performance and verbal fluency (F, A, and S) as the measure of cognitive performance. We measured feasibility as the proportion of consented participants able to complete the DTA. We calculated the relative dual-task effect (DTE %) for each task and identified patterns of dual-task interference. RESULTS: Most consented participants completed the DTA (91%, 40/44) and there were no adverse events. There were 3 main dual-task interference patterns for the first trial using letter 'A': Motor Interference (53%, n = 21), Mutual Interference (23%, n = 9), and Cognitive-Priority Tradeoff (15%, n = 6). For the second trial using letter 'S', there were two main dual-task interference patterns: Cognitive-Priority Tradeoff (53%, n = 21) and Motor Interference (25%, n = 10). STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: DTA was feasible and safe in adults with SCD. We identified specific patterns of cognitive-motor interference. This study supports further evaluation of DTA as a potentially useful tool to measure physical and cognitive function in ambulatory adults with SCD.
34487059	treat|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell	The Effects of Treatment with Blood Transfusion, Iron Chelation and Hydroxyurea on Puberty, Growth and Spermatogenesis in Sickle Cell Disease (SCD): A short update.Sickle cell disease (SCD) is traditionally associated with growth failure and delayed puberty. Wasting and stunting are still prevalent in children and adolescents with SCD, especially in developing countries. In addition, sperm abnormalities are frequent in males with SCD, with high rates of low sperm density, low sperm counts, poor motility, and increased abnormal morphology.  Severe anemia, vaso-occlusive attacks with ischemic injury to different organs including the pituitary gland and testis, and nutritional factors are incriminated in the pathogenesis of defective growth, puberty, and spermatogenesis. There is great phenotypic variability among patients with SCD. The variability in the clinical severity of SCA can partly be explained by genetic modifiers, including HbF level and co-inheritance of alpha-thalassemia. In the past, severe disease led to early mortality. Advancements in treatment have allowed patients with SCD to have a longer and better quality of life. For most patients, the mainstays of treatment are preventive and supportive. For those with severe SCD, three major therapeutic options are currently available: erythrocyte transfusion or exchange, hydroxyurea, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In this mini-review, the authors tried to recognize, delineate, and update knowledge on abnormalities due to SCD from those created by the use of different treatment modalities.
37578485		Vaso-occlusive crisis pain intensity, frequency, and duration: which best correlates with health-related quality of life in adolescents and adults with sickle cell disease?ABSTRACT: In a cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from a randomized clinical trial, we studied 198 adolescents and adults aged 15+ with sickle cell disease. Interest was in assessing the relative strengths of the relationship of vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) pain domains of intensity, frequency, and duration, with health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Variation in psychosocial, physical function, and pain expression domains of HRQOL was partially explained by frequency, intensity, and duration of VOC pain, separately and together, over and above differences in age, sex, genotype, and organ system damage. However, no single domain measure accounted for more than an additional partial R2 of 12.5% alone. Vaso-occlusive crisis pain frequency explained the most variation, when simultaneously considering VOC intensity and duration, except for stiffness, where duration was most predictive. Yet VOC pain intensity, and even VOC duration, also contributed to variability in HRQOL. We recommend that for most purposes, because all 3 VOC pain domains contribute to variability in HRQOL, all 3 domains should be assessed and interventions should be targeted to improve all 3 domains to maximize HRQOL outcomes (Clinical Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02197845).

36964626		Serial prophylactic exchange blood transfusion in pregnant women with sickle cell disease (TAPS-2): statistical and qualitative analysis plan for a randomised controlled feasibility trial.BACKGROUND: There are significant knowledge gaps regarding the effectiveness of serial prophylactic exchange blood transfusion (SPEBT) for pregnant women with sickle cell disease (SCD). The protocol for the randomised feasibility trial assessing SPEBT versus usual care in women with SCD (TAPS2 trial) has previously been published. This publication outlines the statistical and qualitative analysis plan for the study. METHODS AND DESIGN: TAPS2 is a randomised two-arm phase 2 feasibility trial with a nested qualitative study and health economic evaluation. Up to 50 pregnant women with SCD and a singleton pregnancy will be recruited and individually randomised to either SPEBT approximately every 6-10 weeks until delivery (intervention arm) or to usual care (control arm). Information will be collected on a range of feasibility and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Due to the impact of COVID-19 on study recruitment, the initial study period of 24 months was extended to 48 months. Other protocol updates designed to mitigate the impact of COVID-19-related disruption included allowing for remote consent and conducting all qualitative interviews by telephone. The primary outcome for the trial is the overall recruitment rate. The number of women screened, eligible, consented, randomised and withdrawn will be summarised as a CONSORT flow diagram. Differences in clinical outcomes will additionally be presented as an initial assessment of efficacy and to inform sample size calculations for a future definitive trial. Qualitative interviews with trial participants and clinicians will be analysed using reflexive thematic analysis; data from interviews with participants who declined to participate in the trial will be extracted and incorporated into summary tables to report key findings. The health economic analysis plan is not covered by this update. CONCLUSION: The publication of this analysis plan is designed to aid transparency and to reduce the potential for reporting bias. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NIH registry ( www. CLINICALTRIALS: gov ), registration number NCT03975894 (registered 05/06/19); ISRCTN ( www.isrctn.com ), registration number ISRCTN52684446 (retrospectively registered 02/08/19).
34257024		Six-point DIXON and Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Techniques in Quantifying Bone Marrow Fat in Sickle Cell Disease.RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To compare bone marrow fat quantification using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and six-point DIXON (6PD) techniques in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and healthy subjects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prospective study, with 43 SCD patients (24 homozygous [SS], 19 double heterozygous [SC), and 41 healthy subjects paired by age, weight and sex with SCD patients. All participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging with 6PD and single voxel MRS in the L3 vertebral body. Pearson's correlation, ROC curve, and bland-altman analysis were performed, p-values <=0.05 were considered statistically significant for all tests. RESULTS: Significant linear correlation was found between fat fraction (FF) by 6PD and Total Lipids (TL) (r = 0.932; p < 0.001) and Saturated Lipids (SL) (r = 0.934; p < 0.001), in all subjects. Strong correlations were also identified considering subjects of the SS/SC subgroups. Despite high correlations, no significant difference was observed only between FF and SL in the SS subgroup (Bland-Altman analysis), indicating excellent agreement between the fat estimations in this specific situation. Significant differences were observed in all variables (FF, TL, SL) comparing the SCD and healthy subjects. The ROC curve between SCD and healthy subjects showed the following areas under the curve: FF(0.924) > TL(0.883) > SL(0.892). CONCLUSIONS: The comparison between fat quantification by the 6PD with MRS demonstrated an excellent correlation in SCD patients, especially in the SS subgroup, which usually has a higher degree of hemolysis. The diagnostic performance of 6PD and MRS is similar, with advantages of shorter imaging processing time and larger studied area with the 6PD.
34535465		HbA1c performs well in monitoring glucose control even in populations with high prevalence of medical conditions that may alter its reliability: the OPTIMAL observational multicenter study.INTRODUCTION: The utility of HbA1c (glycosylated hemoglobin) to estimate glycemic control in populations of African and other low-resource countries has been questioned because of high prevalence of other medical conditions that may affect its reliability. Using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), we aimed to determine the comparative performance of HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (within 5 hours of a meal) and random non-fasting glucose (RPG) in assessing glycemic burden. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We assessed the performance of HbA1c, FPG and RPG in comparison to CGM mean glucose in 192 Ugandan participants with type 2 diabetes. Analysis was undertaken in all participants, and in subgroups with and without medical conditions reported to affect HbA1c reliability. We then assessed the performance of FPG and RPG, and optimal thresholds, in comparison to HbA1c in participants without medical conditions thought to alter HbA1c reliability. RESULTS: 32.8% (63/192) of participants had medical conditions that may affect HbA1c reliability: anemia 9.4% (18/192), sickle cell trait and/or hemoglobin C (HbC) 22.4% (43/192), or renal impairment 6.3% (12/192). Despite high prevalence of medical conditions thought to affect HbA1c reliability, HbA1c had the strongest correlation with CGM measured glucose in day-to-day living (0.88, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.91), followed by FPG (0.82, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.86) and RPG (0.76, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.81). Among participants without conditions thought to affect HbA1c reliability, FPG and RPG had a similar diagnostic performance in identifying poor glycemic control defined by a range of HbA1c thresholds. FPG of >=7.1 mmol/L and RPG of >=10.5 mmol/L correctly identified 78.2% and 78.8%, respectively, of patients with an HbA1c of >=7.0%. CONCLUSIONS: HbA1c is the optimal test for monitoring glucose control even in low-income and middle-income countries where medical conditions that may alter its reliability are prevalent; FPG and RPG are valuable alternatives where HbA1c is not available.
34407676	treat|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell	Progression of central nervous system disease from pediatric to young adulthood in sickle cell anemia.Silent cerebral infarcts and arteriopathy are common and progressive in individuals with sickle cell anemia. However, most data describing brain lesions in sickle cell anemia are cross-sectional or derive from pediatric cohorts with short follow-up. We investigated the progression of silent cerebral infarct and cerebral vessel stenosis on brain MRI and MRA, respectively, by describing the incidence of new or worsening lesions over a period of up to 25 years among young adults with sickle cell anemia and explored risk factors for progression. Forty-four adults with sickle cell anemia (HbSS or HbSbeta0thalassemia), exposed to chronic transfusions (n = 12) or hydroxyurea (n = 32), median age 19.2 years (range 18.0-31.5), received a screening brain MRI/MRA and their results were compared with a clinical exam performed during childhood and adolescence. We used exact log-rank test to compare MRI and MRA progression among any two groups. The hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated from Cox regression analyses. Progression of MRI and MRA occurred in 12 (27%) and 4 (9%) young adults, respectively, relative to their pediatric exams. MRI progression risk was high among participants with abnormal pediatric exams (HR: 11.6, 95% CI: 2.5-54.7) and conditional or abnormal transcranial Doppler ultrasound velocities (HR: 3.9, 95% CI: 1.0-15.1). Among individuals treated with hydroxyurea, high fetal hemoglobin measured in childhood was associated with lower hazard of MRI progression (HR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.76-0.98). MRA progression occurred more frequently among those with prior stroke (HR: 8.6, 95% CI: 1.2-64), abnormal pediatric exam (P = 0.00084), and elevated transcranial Doppler ultrasound velocities (P = 0.004). Brain MRI/MRA imaging in pediatrics can identify high-risk patients for CNS disease progression in young adulthood, prompting consideration for early aggressive treatments.
38069073		Drug Selection and Posology, Optimal Therapies and Risk/Benefit Assessment in Medicine: The Paradigm of Iron-Chelating Drugs.The design of clinical protocols and the selection of drugs with appropriate posology are critical parameters for therapeutic outcomes. Optimal therapeutic protocols could ideally be designed in all diseases including for millions of patients affected by excess iron deposition (EID) toxicity based on personalised medicine parameters, as well as many variations and limitations. EID is an adverse prognostic factor for all diseases and especially for millions of chronically red-blood-cell-transfused patients. Differences in iron chelation therapy posology cause disappointing results in neurodegenerative diseases at low doses, but lifesaving outcomes in thalassemia major (TM) when using higher doses. In particular, the transformation of TM from a fatal to a chronic disease has been achieved using effective doses of oral deferiprone (L1), which improved compliance and cleared excess toxic iron from the heart associated with increased mortality in TM. Furthermore, effective L1 and L1/deferoxamine combination posology resulted in the complete elimination of EID and the maintenance of normal iron store levels in TM. The selection of effective chelation protocols has been monitored by MRI T2* diagnosis for EID levels in different organs. Millions of other iron-loaded patients with sickle cell anemia, myelodysplasia and haemopoietic stem cell transplantation, or non-iron-loaded categories with EID in different organs could also benefit from such chelation therapy advances. Drawbacks of chelation therapy include drug toxicity in some patients and also the wide use of suboptimal chelation protocols, resulting in ineffective therapies. Drug metabolic effects, and interactions with other metals, drugs and dietary molecules also affected iron chelation therapy. Drug selection and the identification of effective or optimal dose protocols are essential for positive therapeutic outcomes in the use of chelating drugs in TM and other iron-loaded and non-iron-loaded conditions, as well as general iron toxicity.
37736809		Evaluating Consistency of Documented ICD Codes for Hospitalized Patients With Sickle Cell Disease.OBJECTIVES: Conducting health services research relies on consistent diagnosis code documentation; however, it is unknown if consistent documentation in claims data occurs among patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and/or trait (SCT). The objective of this study was to examine the consistency of International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code documentation for SCD/SCT and identify coding discrepancies between patients' hospitalizations. PATIENTS: A total of 80 031 hospitalization records across 528 hospitals belonging to 15 380 unique patients who had at least 1 documentation of SCD/SCT and 2 or more hospitalizations during the study period (April 2015-December 2016). METHODS: Secondary analysis of patient discharge abstracts in California, Florida, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. ICD 9 and ICD 10 codes identified patients with SCD/SCT. Variations in documentation consistency across hospitals were examined. RESULTS: Only 51% of patients were consistently documented. There were statistically significant differences in whether a patient was or was not consistently documented based on: age, race/ethnicity, sex, insurer, and disease type. Twenty-five percent of hospitalization records were not consistently documented with an SCD code. Hospitalization records, for patients not consistently documented (49%), often included primary admitting diagnoses for conditions associated with SCD. Few hospitals (18%) were above average in consistently documenting SCD/SCT. CONCLUSIONS: Not consistent documentation for SCD/SCT occurs with variation among patients and across disease type and hospitals. These findings signal to researchers the importance of thoroughly identifying all hospitalizations when studying populations with chronic disease. Without accurate documentation, research relying on claims data may produce inaccurate findings.
35671012		Do racial and ethnic disparities lead to the undertreatment of pain? Are there solutions?PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The current review aims to empower anesthesiologists, specifically pain medicine specialists, to become leaders in ensuring equitable care. RECENT FINDINGS: Disparities in both acute and chronic pain medicine lead to increased morbidity for patients of color. Gaps in care include misdiagnosis or under diagnosis of chronic pain disease states, undertreatment of sickle cell disease and other conditions that are common in minorities, under prescription of opioids, and lack of access to novel opioid sparing treatments. While the causes of these disparities are multifactorial, care team implicit bias and lack of representation are two of the major factors. Solutions are challenging, but the authors suggest an inside out solution. We believe that this practice will have far-reaching downstream effects, including improving diversity in our field and quality of care for our patients. SUMMARY: The current article reviews disparities in both acute and chronic pain treatment for underrepresented racial and ethnic minorities in the United States. The authors examine whether implicit bias and lack of representation are a contributing factor for these disparities. Lastly, we will discuss potential solutions.

It is important to investigate specific complications related to sickle cell disease but also other causes of anemia in general. Transfusions or exchange transfusions are major therapeutic options and are frequently used for acute complications of sickle cell disease but also for primary and secondary prevention of some of the chronic complications. The transfusion strategy has been modified since the awareness of post-transfusion hemolysis by taking into account the transfusion risk score. A strong collaboration between the patient's expert center, the Blood center and the patient's hospitalization unit is required to make decisions.   2023 Societe nationale francaise de medecine interne (SNFMI).

German guidelines recommend annual monitoring of fertility parameters to enable early detection of fertility impairment and/or to offer fertility preservation (FP) when indicated. We explored the general desire for parenthood, the frequency of recalling fertility counseling and testing, and the utilization of FP in adolescents and adults with hemoglobinopathies. PROCEDURE: In a cross-sectional study, patients aged 12-50 years, treated in Germany, Austria, or Switzerland, were surveyed on fertility-related aspects. Medical data, including fertility testing results, were collected from patient records. RESULTS: Overall, 116/121 eligible patients, diagnosed with sickle cell disease (70.7%), thalassemia (27.6%), or other hemoglobinopathy (1.7%), participated in our study (57.8% female, median age 17.0 years, range 12-50 years). All participants required treatment of the underlying hemoglobinopathy: 68.1% received hydroxyurea, 25.9% required regular blood transfusions, and 6.0% underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Most patients (82/108, 75.9%) stated a considerable to strong desire for (future) parenthood, independent of sex, education, diagnosis, or subjective health status. Fertility counseling was only recalled by 32/111 patients (28.8%) and least frequently by younger patients (12-16 years) or those treated with regular blood transfusions or hydroxyurea. While fertility testing was documented for 59.5% (69/116) in medical records, only 11.6% (13/112) recalled previous assessments. FP was only used by 5.4% (6/111) of patients. CONCLUSION: Most patients with hemoglobinopathies wish to have biological children, yet only few recalled fertility counseling and testing. Adequate patient counseling should be offered to all patients at risk for infertility.

DESIGN: Single blind randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Tertiary care hospital. PARTICIPANTS: 104 children with sickle cell disease and skeletal vaso-occlusive crisis. INTERVENTION: Intravenous acetaminophen at 10mg/kg/dose 8 hourly and intravenous diclofenac sodium at 1mg/kg/dose 8 hourly in 1:1 ratio. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Reduction in pain score (50%), number of doses needed to relieve pain after 24 hours of drug administration and decrease in pain score at 1 hour. RESULTS: A 50% reduction in pain score was seen in 35 (77.3%) and 10 (21.7%) children among acetaminophen and diclofenac sodium groups respectively (RR, 95% CI 3.6; 2.02-6.33, P< 0.001). The mean (SD) fall in pain score at 1 hour was significantly higher among intervention arm as compared to control arm [1.51 (0.5) and 1.06 (0.5); P<0.001]. Eight (17.4%) patients developed local phlebitis at the site of infusion among diclofenac group. CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous acetaminophen is a better alternative to intravenous diclofenac in children with skeletal vaso-occlusive crisis.
33892094		A pilot study of the acceptability, feasibility and safety of yoga for chronic pain in sickle cell disease.OBJECTIVES: To determine the acceptability, feasibility and safety of yoga for chronic pain in sickle cell disease. DESIGN AND SETTING: In Part A of this two-part study, adolescents with SCD and chronic pain (Group 1) and their parent (Group 2) completed a survey designed to capture pain characteristics, attitudes and practices related to yoga, and potential acceptability of a yoga program. In Part B, the study assessed the feasibility and safety of an instructor-led group yoga program. The study was registered on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03694548). INTERVENTION: Eight instructor-led group yoga sessions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Feasibility and safety outcomes were chosen a priori, as follows: 1) Proportion of adolescent patients with SCD and chronic pain approached that consent to participate in Part A, 2) Proportion of adolescent participants enrolled in Part A that consent to participate in Part B, 3) Proportion of participants enrolled in Part B that attend at least 6 of 8 yoga sessions, 4) Proportion of participants enrolled in Part B with an ED visit or a hospitalization for pain within 24 h of completion of each yoga session, 5) Proportion of participants in Part B who complete all study assessments before, and at the end of the yoga program, 6) Adherence to submission of pain diary. RESULTS: The median age of 15 patient participants in Part A was 16 (IQR 14-17), and 14 parents was 43.5 (IQR 42-51). Most participants were female. Most participant responses indicated a positive opinion of yoga. Nine adolescents (60 %) from Part A participated in Part B of the study. The median age of 9 participants in Part B was 17 (IQR 15-18), and 5 of the 9 participants were female (53.3 %). Only one participant was able to attend 3 of the 8 yoga sessions offered, and did not experience any ED visits or hospitalizations following the yoga sessions. None of the other feasibility endpoints were met in this study. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with SCD and chronic pain overall have a positive opinion of yoga, but there are challenges with recruitment and retention of participants in a clinical trial of yoga, and barriers to feasibility of an in-person group yoga intervention.
34968422		Accurate long-read sequencing allows assembly of the duplicated RHD and RHCE genes harboring variants relevant to blood transfusion.Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have transformed medical genetics. However, short-read lengths pose a limitation on identification of structural variants, sequencing repetitive regions, phasing of distant nucleotide changes, and distinguishing highly homologous genomic regions. Long-read sequencing technologies may offer improvements in the characterization of genes that are currently difficult to assess. We used a combination of targeted DNA capture, long-read sequencing, and a customized bioinformatics pipeline to fully assemble the RH region, which harbors variation relevant to red cell donor-recipient mismatch, particularly among patients with sickle cell disease. RHD and RHCE are a pair of duplicated genes located within an ~175 kb region on human chromosome 1 that have high sequence similarity and frequent structural variations. To achieve the assembly, we utilized palindrome repeats in PacBio SMRT reads to obtain consensus sequences of 2.1 to 2.9 kb average length with over 99% accuracy. We used these long consensus sequences to identify 771 assembly markers and to phase the RHD-RHCE region with high confidence. The dataset enabled direct linkage between coding and intronic variants, phasing of distant SNPs to determine RHD-RHCE haplotypes, and identification of known and novel structural variations along with the breakpoints. A limiting factor in phasing is the frequency of heterozygous assembly markers and therefore was most successful in samples from African Black individuals with increased heterogeneity at the RH locus. Overall, this approach allows RH genotyping and de novo assembly in an unbiased and comprehensive manner that is necessary to expand application of NGS technology to high-resolution RH typing.

34077859	treat|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Stroke	Stroke and stroke prevention in sickle cell anemia in developed and selected developing countries.This comprehensive review provides an insight into the pathophysiology, epidemiology, evaluation, and treatment of sickle cell anemia (SCA)-related stroke in developed and developing countries. Vascular injury, hypercoagulability and vaso-occlusion play a role in the pathophysiology of stroke in SCA. Transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) has lowered the incidence of ischemic stroke from 11% to 1% as TCD identifies children who are at risk for stroke, providing opportunities for interventions to reduce this risk. Whereas blood exchange is indicated in acute stroke, chronic transfusions (either simple or exchange on a monthly basis) are used for primary as well as secondary stroke prevention in developed countries. Children with abnormally high TCD velocities (>= 200 cm/s) are at high risk of stroke and might benefit from hydroxyurea or hydroxycarbamide (HU) after a period of a successful transition from chronic transfusions. Hematopoietic stem cell transplant presents a cure for SCA. Gene therapy is currently investigated and may be offered to patients with SCA who had a stroke or who are at high risk of stroke if proven efficacious and safe. However, gene therapy is not likely to be implemented in low-income countries due to cost. Alternatively, HU is utilized for primary and secondary stroke prevention in developing countries. Further expansion of TCD implementation should be a priority in those settings.
35485519	associate|@DISEASE_Priapism|@GENE_F5	Rare emergency in children: Priapism and stepwise treatment approach.BACKGROUND: Priapism is a rare condition in children and the treatment algorithm is controversial in this age group. Herein, we report eight cases with low-flow priapism and our stepwise treatment approach in light of literature. METHODS: We present a simple stepwise treatment for low-flow priapism including five steps. Step 1: Cold compress and analgesia while evaluation the priapism and its etiology. Step 2: Corporal aspiration and adrenaline infusion in the ward. Step 3: Modified Winter shunt in the same place. Step 4: Ketamine application and caudal block in the operating room. Step 5: Sapheno-cavernous (Grayhack) shunt. Eight cases with low-flow priapism were reviewed retrospectively. Symptoms, duration of tumescence, the interventions, and step that provide detumescence were recorded. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 8.5 years (1-17 y). The median time of the priapism before admission was 15 h (4-165 h). The etiological factors were sickle cell disease, hemodialysis due to chronic renal failure, and factor V Leiden mutation in three patients. Detumescence was achieved in one patient at Step 2, in two patients at Steps 3, 4, and 5, respectively. Rigidity of cavernous body was observed in one patient in long-term follow-up. CONCLUSION: Low-flow priapism is a urological emergency that may cause erectile dysfunction. Treatment options should be selected according to a protocol that prevents time loss and avoids more invasive treatment in unnecessary situations. Our algorithm with simple nature and its steps from less invasive to more invasive procedures may be an alternative for the treatment of low-flow priapism.
37059617	treat|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell	[Lung manifestations of sickle-cell disease].Sickle-cell disease is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder of hemoglobin that causes systemic damage. Hypoxia is the main actor of sickle-cell disease. It initiates acutely the pathogenic cascade leading to tissue damages that in turn induce chronic hypoxia. Lung lesions represent the major risk of morbidity and mortality. Management of sickle-cell disease requires a tight collaboration between hematologists, intensivists and chest physicians. Recurrent episodes of thrombosis and hemolysis characterize the disease. New therapeutic protocols, associating hydroxyurea, transfusion program and stem cell transplantation in severe cases allow a prolonged survival until the fifth decade. However, recurrent pain, crisis, frequent hospital admissions due to infection, anemia or acute chest syndrome and chronic complications leading to organ deficiencies degrade the patients' quality of life. In low-income countries where the majority of sickle-cell patients are living, the disease is still associated with a high mortality in childhood. This paper focuses on acute chest syndrome and chronic lung manifestations.

37528521		Sickle cell anemia in pregnant Saudi women and its impact on birth weight and gestational maturity.BACKGROUND: It is well documented that sickle cell anemia (SCA) in pregnancy increases the risk of problems that can influence the growth and maturation of the newborn. OBJECTIVES: To assess the gestational maturity and birth weight of babies born to Saudi mothers with sickle cell anemia in the Jazan region. METHODS: A case-control study was conducted in three hospitals in the Jazan region. An interview with a semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect data from the participants' women, and then the birth weight was taken. RESULTS: Of 187 delivered women, 20.3% had SCA (13% had sickle cell disease, and the remaining had sickle cell trait). Among the 38 affected mothers, 15.7% were considered to have an additional risk (7.9% had diabetes mellitus, 5.3% had hypertension, and 2.6% were smokers). The mean birth weight was 2.95+- 0.40 kilograms and 2.99+- 0.55 kilograms in the case and control groups, respectively. However, the low birth weight babies constitute 31% of the delivered babies in the SCA group with a weight of 2.33+- 0.16 kg and 15% of the control group with a mean weight of 2.16+- 0.30 kilograms. The gestational age was 39.36+- 1.02 weeks in the SCA group compared to 39.5 +-1.17 weeks in the control group. Maternal age and hypertension significantly influence the birth weight in the SCA group compared to the influence of diabetes mellitus on the birth weight in the control group. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that SCA in pregnant mothers influences birth weight, which is more impacted by maternal age and co-morbidities. Therefore, a multidisciplinary approach must monitor these risky pregnancies well to avoid undesirable neonatal outcomes.
36760169		Non-invasive fetal genotyping for maternal alleles with droplet digital PCR: A comparative study of analytical approaches.OBJECTIVES: To develop a flexible droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) workflow to perform non-invasive prenatal diagnosis via relative mutation dosage (RMD) for maternal pathogenic variants with a range of inheritance patterns, and to compare the accuracy of multiple analytical approaches. METHODS: Cell free DNA (cfDNA) was tested from 124 archived maternal plasma samples: 88 cases for sickle cell disease and 36 for rare Mendelian conditions. Three analytical methods were compared: sequential probability ratio testing (SPRT), Bayesian and z-score analyses. RESULTS: The SPRT, Bayesian and z-score analyses performed similarly well with correct prediction rates of 96%, 97% and 98%, respectively. However, there were high rates of inconclusive results for each cohort, particularly for z-score analysis which was 31% overall. Two samples were incorrectly classified by all three analytical methods; a false negative result predicted for a fetus affected with sickle cell disease and a false positive result predicting the presence of an X-linked IDS variant in an unaffected fetus. CONCLUSIONS: ddPCR can be applied to RMD for diverse conditions and inheritance patterns, but all methods carry a small risk of erroneous results. Further evaluation is required both to reduce the rate of inconclusive results and explore discordant results in more detail.
36074711	associate|@DISEASE_beta_Thalassemia|@GENE_SUPT5H	The hemoglobinopathies, molecular disease mechanisms and diagnostics.Hemoglobinopathies are the most common monogenic disorders in the world with an ever increasing global disease burden each year. As most hemoglobinopathies show recessive inheritance carriers are usually clinically silent. Programmes for preconception and antenatal carrier screening, with the option of prenatal diagnosis are considered beneficial in many endemic countries. With the development of genetic tools such as Array analysis and Next Generation Sequencing in addition to state of the art screening at the hematologic, biochemic and genetic level, have contributed to the discovery of an increasing number of rare rearrangements and novel factors influencing the disease severity over the recent years. This review summarizes the basic requirements for adequate carrier screening analysis, the importance of genotype-phenotype correlation and how this may lead to the unrevealing exceptional interactions causing a clinically more severe phenotype in otherwise asymptomatic carriers. A special group of patients are beta-thalassemia carriers presenting with features of beta-thalassemia intermedia of various clinical severity. The disease mechanisms may involve duplicated alpha-globin genes, mosaic partial Uniparental Isodisomy of chromosome 11p15.4 where the HBB gene is located or haplo-insufficiency of a non-linked gene SUPT5H on chromosome 19q, first described in two Dutch families with beta-thalassemia trait without variants in the HBB gene.
33830027		Systematic Review/Meta-Analysis on Efficacy of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation in Sickle Cell Disease: An International Effort on Behalf of the Pediatric Diseases Working Party of European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation and the Sickle Cell Transplantation International Consortium.Sickle cell disease (SCD) affects more than 300,000 children annually worldwide. Despite improved supportive care, long-term prognosis remains poor. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is the sole validated curative option, resulting in sustained resolution of the clinical phenotype. The medical literature on allo-HCT for SCD is largely limited to children. Recent studies have evaluated allo-HCT efficacy in adults. Here, we conducted a systematic review/meta-analysis to assess the totality of evidence on the efficacy, or lack thereof, of allo-HCT in treating SCD. We performed a comprehensive literature search using PubMed/Medline, Embase, and Cochrane library databases on November 13, 2019. Four authors independently extracted data on clinical outcomes related to benefits (overall survival [OS] and disease-free survival [DFS]) and harms (acute graft-versus-host disease [aGVHD], chronic graft-versus-host disease [cGVHD], nonrelapse mortality [NRM], and graft failure [GF]). Our search identified a total of 1906 references. Only 33 studies (n= 2853 patients) met our inclusion criteria. We also performed a subset analysis by age. Analyses of all-age groups showed pooled rates of 96% for OS, 90% for DFS, 20% for aGVHD, 10% for cGVHD, 4% for NRM, and 5% for GF. In the pediatric population, pooled rates for OS, DFS, aGVHD, cGVHD, NRM, and GF were 97%, 91%, 26%, 11%, 5%, and 3%, respectively. In adults, pooled rates for OS, DFS, aGVHD, cGVHD, NRM, and GF were 98%, 90%, 7%, 1%, 0%, and 14%, respectively. Our data show that allo-HCT is safe and effective, yielding pooled OS rates exceeding 90%. The high GF rate of 14% in adults is concerning and emphasizes the need to evaluate new strategies.
36996064	stimulate|@DISEASE_Acute_Chest_Syndrome|@GENE_IL5 ;stimulate|@DISEASE_Acute_Chest_Syndrome|@GENE_IL13	Acute chest syndrome, airway inflammation and lung function in sickle cell disease.BACKGROUND: Acute chest syndrome (ACS) is an acute complication in SCD but its effects on lung function are not well understood. Inflammation is a key component of SCD pathophysiology but with an unclear association with lung function. We hypothesized that children with ACS had worse lung function than children without ACS and aimed to investigate the association of lung function deficits with inflammatory cytokines. METHODS: Patients enrolled in a previous 2-year randomized clinical trial who had consented to future data use, were enrolled for the present exploratory study. Patients were categorized into ACS and non-ACS groups. Demographic and clinical information were collected. Serum samples were used for quantification of serum cytokines and leukotriene B4 levels and pulmonary function tests (PFTs) were assessed. RESULTS: Children with ACS had lower total lung capacity (TLC) at baseline and at 2 years, with a significant decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1) and mid-maximal expiratory flow rate (FEF25-75%) in the 2 year period (p = 0.015 and p = 0.039 respectively). For children with ACS, serum cytokines IL-5, and IL-13 were higher at baseline and at 2 years compared to children with no ACS. IP-10 and IL-6 were negatively correlated with PFT markers. In multivariable regression using generalized estimating equation approach for factors predicting lung function, age was significantly associated FEV1 (p = 0.047) and ratio of FEV1 and forced vital capacity (FVC)- FEV1/FVC ratio (p = 0.006); males had lower FEV1/FVC (p = 0.035) and higher TLC (p = 0.031). Asthma status was associated with FEV1 (p = 0.017) and FVC (p = 0.022); history of ACS was significantly associated with TLC (p = 0.027). CONCLUSION: Pulmonary function abnormalities were more common and inflammatory markers were elevated in patients with ACS, compared with those without ACS. These findings suggest airway inflammation is present in children with SCD and ACS, which could be contributing to impaired pulmonary function.
34915846		Using DNA testing for the precise, definite, and low-cost diagnosis of sickle cell disease and other Haemoglobinopathies: findings from Tanzania.BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an important cause of under-five mortality. Tanzania is the 5th country in the world with the highest births prevalence of SCD individuals. Significant advances in the neonatal diagnosis of SCD using rapid point-of-care testing have been made. However genetic confirmation is still required for positive cases, in uncertain cases, in multiply transfused patients, to resolve compound heterozygosity (Hb S/ beta0 Thal or Hb S/ beta+ thal) not uncommon in the coastal regions of East Africa and increasingly also for pre-marital counselling and potentially for future curative approaches such as gene therapy. The currently available DNA tests are prohibitively expensive. Here, we describe an easy-to-use, affordable and accurate beta-globin sequencing approach that can be easily integrated within existing NBS for SCD and other haemoglobinopathies especially in Low- and Middle-income Countries. AIM: To evaluate an affordable DNA technology for the diagnosis of Sickle cell disease and other haemoglobinopathies in a resource-limited setting. METHODS: Laboratory-based validation study was conducted by Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences and the University of Oxford involving sequencing of the entire beta -haemoglobin locus using the Oxford Nanopore MinION platform. A total number of 36 Dried blood spots and whole blood samples were subjected to conventional protein-based methods (isoelectric focusing, HPLC), and/or sequenced by the Sanger method as comparators. RESULTS: Sequencing results for SCD using the MinION were 100% concordant with those from the Sanger method. In addition, the long-read DNA sequencing method enabled the resolution of cases with unusual phenotypes which make up 1% of all children in Tanzania. The cost is $11/ sample for consumables, which is cheaper compared to other sequencing platforms. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of a comprehensive single DNA assay as a definitive diagnostic test for SCD and other haemoglobinopathies. The test is fast, precise, accurate and affordable.

We aimed to explore the link of pancreatic iron by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) with glucose metabolism and cardiac complications (CC) in sickle cell disease (SCD) patients. METHODS: We considered 70 SCD patients consecutively enrolled in the Extension-Myocardial Iron Overload in Thalassemia Network. Iron overload was quantified by R2* technique and biventricular function by cine images. Macroscopic myocardial fibrosis was evaluated by late gadolinium enhancement technique. Glucose metabolism was assessed by the oral glucose tolerance test. RESULTS: Patients with an altered glucose metabolism showed a significantly higher pancreas R2* than patients with normal glucose metabolism. Pancreatic siderosis emerged as a risk factor for the development of metabolic alterations (OddsRatio 8.25, 95%confidence intervals 1.51-45.1; p = .015). Global pancreas R2* values were directly correlated with mean serum ferritin levels and liver iron concentration. Global pancreas R2* was not significantly associated with global heart R2* and macroscopic myocardial fibrosis. Patients with history of CC showed a significantly higher global pancreas R2* than patients with no CC. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the evaluation of pancreatic R2* by MRI in SCD patients to prevent the development of metabolic and cardiac disorders.
36270432		Enrollment Lessons from a Biological Assignment Study of Marrow Transplantation versus Standard Care for Adolescents and Young Adults with Sickle Cell Disease: Considerations for Future Gene and Cellular Therapy Trials.We previously conducted a single-arm feasibility study (STRIDE1) of myeloablative bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in adolescents and young adults with sickle cell disease (SCD). The trial identified donors before entry, enrolled well, and found no unexpected regimen-related toxicity. Although many single-arm studies have been published, there are no controlled trials of either BMT or gene therapy in SCD. Therefore, we designed a comparative trial by biological assignment (available donor versus no donor). This multicenter National Institutes of Health-funded study (Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network 1503; STRIDE2) enrolled patients between 2016 and 2021 at 35 sites. Lagging recruitment led to study closure, and here we report the impediments to accrual. The BMT regimen and entry criteria were from STRIDE1, and 2-year survival was the primary endpoint. To minimize selection bias from prior HLA typing, STRIDE2 excluded individuals with previously identified donors. Accrual was stopped at 69% of target (138 enrolled; assigned 28 with donor, 96 with no donor). Barriers to enrollment included lower than expected frequency of HLA-matched related and unrelated donors; loss of enrollees owing to previously identified donors; conventional care arm dissuading some seeking BMT; challenging short-term endpoints in SCD, including incomplete documentation of sickle pain episodes; state Medicaid (primary insurers of SCD) denial of BMT coverage for adult SCD despite the study having secured Coverage with Evidence Development from the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services; slowed accrual in 2019 to 2021 during the Coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic; and restriction of BMT resourcing for nonmalignant diseases by academic medical (cancer) centers. Social obstacles and access to BMT centers also limited entry, as did practitioner and participant concerns over suitability, cost, and toxicity. Planning for future controlled trials of curative therapy in SCD and other nonmalignant diseases likely will meet these enrollment challenges. Lessons from this trial may aid the development of future comparative studies.
38289184		RH genotypes and red cell alloimmunization rates in chronically transfused patients with sickle cell disease: A multisite study in the USA.BACKGROUND: Red cell alloimmunization remains a challenge for individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD) and contributes to increased risk of hemolytic transfusion reactions and associated comorbidities. Despite prophylactic serological matching for ABO, Rh, and K, red cell alloimmunization persists, in part, due to a high frequency of variant RH alleles in patients with SCD and Black blood donors. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We compared RH genotypes and rates of alloimmunization in 342 pediatric and young adult patients with SCD on chronic transfusion therapy exposed to >90,000 red cell units at five sites across the USA. Genotyping was performed with RHD and RHCE BeadChip arrays and targeted assays. RESULTS: Prevalence of overall and Rh-specific alloimmunization varied among institutions, ranging from 5% to 41% (p = .0035) and 5%-33% (p = .0002), respectively. RH genotyping demonstrated that 33% RHD and 57% RHCE alleles were variant in this cohort. Patients with RHCE alleles encoding partial e antigens had higher rates of anti-e identified than those encoding at least one conventional e antigen (p = .0007). There was no difference in anti-D, anti-C, or anti-E formation among patients with predicted partial or altered antigen expression compared to those with conventional antigens, suggesting that variant Rh on donor cells may also stimulate alloimmunization to these antigens. DISCUSSION: These results highlight variability in alloimmunization rates and suggest that a molecular approach to Rh antigen matching may be necessary for optimal prevention of alloimmunization given the high prevalence of variant RH alleles among both patients and Black donors.

35088912		The ektacytometric elongation Index (EI) of erythrocytes, validation of a prognostic, rheological biomarker for patients with sickle cell disease.OBJECTIVES: Validation of the measurement of erythrocyte deformability as a useful prognostic, rheological biomarker for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). METHODS: The degree of reduced deformability was based on the value of the maximum elongation index (EImax ) of the deformability curve of an osmotic gradient ektacytometer. The performance of this technique was analytically and clinically validated by analysing 200 normal subjects and 100 patients with well-documented thalassemia's and Hb variants in relation to their clinical condition. RESULTS: In this study, we show that EImax is a reproducible parameter with a small inter-individual coefficient of (Biological) variation (CV)=1.6% and a small intra-individual CV=3.5%. We demonstrate that loss of deformability correlates with the clinical condition and the various mutations underlying sickle cell disease and thalassemia. For SCD patients, a strongly reduced EImax with a cut-off =0.360 is a signal for future vaso-occlusive (VOC) events requiring hospitalisation with a specificity=85%, sensitivity=80%, PPV=81% and NPV=84% based on a ROC curve (AUC=0.89). CONCLUSION: This study validated the clinical utility of EImax as a prognostic marker for future clinical problems in individual high-risk SCD patients. In addition, EImax may help to achieve an adequate personal transfusion policy for an optimal blood flow in anaemic patients with SCD.
36927679		Patient perspectives on noninvasive prenatal testing among black women in the United States: a scoping review.Advances in reproductive health technologies such as noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) are changing the landscape of prenatal care and maternal health. NIPT, made clinically available in the United States (US) in 2011, is a screening test that utilizes cell-free DNA (cfDNA) to detect for aneuploidies and genetic characteristics in fetal DNA. In September 2020, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommended NIPT for all pregnant patients regardless of age or risk factors. We examined peer-reviewed, empirical studies published from January 2011 to February 2022, assessing NIPT studies with patient perspectives in the US and what is known about how empirical studies include Black women. Our scoping review draws from PubMed (with advanced MeSH search options) and Scopus databases for advanced scoping review, with 33 articles meeting our criteria. Empirical studies on NIPT show patient perceptions range across five themes: 1) accuracy / safety, 2) return of results, 3) patient knowledge, 4) informed consent, and 5) perceptions among minoritized groups (with perceptions of race and gender as a social demographic intersection). Additionally, among the 15 studies that included that Black woman in their study sample, none measured the perceptions of Black women with genetic conditions. Bridging this knowledge gap is critical because NIPT is becoming increasingly accessible across the nation and is being developed to screen for additional genetic conditions, such as sickle cell disease. Ultimately, NIPT researchers need to go to greater lengths to examine the patient perspectives of Black women with and without genetic conditions.
34708738		Asymmetric diabetic retinopathy.Increasing prevalence of diabetes mellitus warrants recognition of factors related to asymmetric diabetic retinopathy (DR). This thematic synthesis based on an iterative literature review conducted in Medline and Google Scholar pertaining to diabetes with coexistent asymmetry of retinopathy included 45 original articles, 21 case reports and series, and 18 review articles from 1965 to 2020. Asymmetric DR is defined as proliferative DR (PDR) in one eye and nonproliferative, preproliferative, background, or no DR in the other eye lasting for at least 2 years. It is observed in 5%-10% of patients with PDR. Associated factors can be divided into (i) vascular: carotid obstructive disease, ocular ischemic syndrome, and retinal vascular diseases; (ii) Inflammatory: uveitis, endophthalmitis, and Fuchs' heterochromic cyclitis; (iii) degenerative: posterior vitreous detachment, high myopia and anisometropia, uveal coloboma, retinal detachment, retinitis pigmentosa, and chorioretinal atrophy and scarring; (iv) cataract surgery and vitrectomy; and (v) miscellaneous: elevated intraocular pressure, glaucoma, amblyopia, retinal detachment, and optic atrophy. The gamut of diagnostic modalities for asymmetric DR includes thorough ocular examination, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, fundus photography, fundus fluorescein angiography, optical coherence tomography, and newer modalities such as ultra-widefield fluorescein angiography and optical coherence tomography angiography, along with a complete systemic evaluation and carotid Doppler studies. The differential diagnosis includes other causes of retinal neovascularization that may present in an asymmetric manner, such as sickle cell retinopathy, retinal vein occlusions, and featureless retina. This review discusses in detail the aforementioned considerations and draws a comprehensive picture of asymmetric DR in order to sensitize ophthalmologists to this important condition.
34688625		Strategic priorities for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in the EMRO region.The World Health Organization-designated Eastern Mediterranean region (EMRO) consists of 22 countries in North Africa and Western Asia with a collective population of over 679 million. The area comprises some of the wealthiest countries per capita income and some of the poorest. The population structure is also unique and contrasts with western countries, with a much younger population. The region sits in the heart of the thalassemia belt. Many countries have a significant prevalence of sickle cell disease, and cancer is on the rise in the region. Therefore, the strategic priorities for the growth and development of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) differ from country to country based on resources, healthcare challenges, and prevalent infrastructure. Thirty-one reporting teams to the Eastern Mediterranean Blood and Marrow Transplantation Group have active HSCT programs in 12 countries; allogeneic transplants outnumber autologous transplants, and the proportion of allotransplants for non-malignant conditions is higher in the EMRO region than in Western Europe and North America. The vast majority (99%) of allotransplants are from matched related donors. Matched unrelated donors and other alternate donor transplants are underutilized. The chance of finding a matched related donor for allografts is higher, with a significant chance of finding matched donors among non-sibling related donors. Reasons for relatively lower rates of transplants compared with other countries are multifactorial. Capacity building, development of newer centers, innovative funding, and better utilization of information technology are required to make transplantation as an accessible modality to more patients. Cost-effectiveness and cost-containment, regulation, and ensuring quality will all be priorities in planning HSCT development in the region.
34955521		Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in a Previously Vaccinated Adolescent Female With Sickle Cell Disease.Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a serious complication that is observed most commonly in pediatric patients following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections. However, the mechanism and predictors of disease are poorly understood. There are no prior reports of MIS-C among patients who have been fully vaccinated, and only a single case of MIS in an adult patient who had received his second shot just 4 days prior to symptom onset. Here, we present an adolescent with sickle cell disease who was fully vaccinated against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and had no prior history of known or suspected infection, who presented in shock and was ultimately diagnosed with MIS-C. This case highlights the importance of clinical suspicion for MIS-C even when patients are fully vaccinated.
34290181		The impact of body mass index on left ventricular mass index, right ventricular function, and cardiac dimension of children with sickle cell anemia in Enugu City.BACKGROUND: Body mass index is a major determinant of cardiac annular valvar dimension and left ventricular mass index in children with sickle cell anemia. OBJECTIVES: The study is aimed at ascertaining the impact of Body Mass Index on Left ventricular mass index, right ventricular function and cardiac dimension of children with sickle cell anemia. METHODS: A case control study in which echocardiographic measurement of cardiac function and structures were ascertained among children with sickle cell anemia compared with hemoglobin AA genotype. RESULTS: There were 51 subjects and 50 controls. The subjects comprised 54.9% males and controls, 52.0% male. There was a strong positive correlation between BMI and most cardiac structure diameters among children with normal hemoglobin genotype (Pearson's correlation coefficient value, P < 0.001) There was also statistically significant positive correlation between BMI and LV mass among the subjects (n = 50, r = 0.5, P < 0.001). There was significant positive correlation between BMI and TAPSE in both subjects and controls as well as between BMI and RVSP among the subjects, but not the controls (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the number with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) based on their nutritional status (n = 51, chi^2 = 7.03, P = 0.32). The BMI correlated negatively with left ventricular mass index (LVMI) among the subjects, but the correlation was not statistically significant (r = -0.1, P = 0.53). CONCLUSION: There was significant positive correlation between BMI and TAPSE in both subjects and controls as well as between BMI and RVSP among the subjects, but not the controls. Body mass index correlated negatively with left ventricular mass index (LVMI) among the subjects.
36947347		Positive rate and quality assessment of CT pulmonary angiography in sickle cell disease: a case-control study.BACKGROUND: Pulmonary complications are common in sickle cell disease (SCD) and can mimic pulmonary embolisms (PEs), leading to potential overuse of computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA). Maximizing the quality of CTPA is essential for its diagnostic accuracy. However, little is known about the positive rate and quality of CTPA in SCD. METHODS: This retrospective case-control study aimed to determine the positive rate and quality of CTPA studies performed to rule out PE in SCD (HbSS genotype) patients compared to a control group. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent factors associated with suboptimal CTPA studies, defined as a mean enhancement of < 210 HU in the pulmonary artery. RESULTS: The study included 480 patients, consisting of 240 SCD patients and 240 controls. The positive rate of PE was 4.0%, with a similar rate in both SCD patients and the control group (4.2% vs. 3.8%, p = 0.08). However, SCD patients had significantly lower contrast enhancement of the pulmonary artery than the control group (266.1 +- 90.5 HU vs. 342.2 +- 116.1 HU, p < 0.01). Notably, 25.4% of SCD patients had suboptimal scans. The logistic regression model demonstrated that SCD was significantly associated with suboptimal pulmonary arterial contrast enhancement compared to the control group (OR = 4.4; 95% CI: 2.4-8.3). CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed a relatively low positive rate of CTPA in both SCD patients and the control group. However, SCD was significantly associated with suboptimal image quality due to inadequate contrast enhancement of the pulmonary artery. Further research is needed to identify measures that can enhance the quality of CTPA studies in SCD patients and to establish a specific imaging protocol for this patient population.
36197949		A novel deep learning approach for sickle cell anemia detection in human RBCs using an improved wrapper-based feature selection technique in microscopic blood smear images.Sickle Cell Anemia (SCA) is a disorder in Red Blood Cells (RBCs) of human blood. Children under five years and pregnant women are mostly affected by SCA. Early diagnosis of this ailment can save lives. In recent years, the computer aided diagnosis of SCA is preferred to resolve this issue. A novel and effective deep learning approach for identification of sickle cell anemia is proposed in this work. Around nine hundred microscopic images of human red blood cells are obtained from the public database 'erythrocytes IDB'. All the images are resized uniformly. About 2048 deep features are extracted from the fully connected layer of pre-trained model InceptionV3. These features are further subjected to classification using optimization-based methods. An improved wrapper-based feature selection technique is implemented using Multi- Objective Binary Grey Wolf Optimization (MO-BGWO) approach with KNN and SVM for classification. The detection of sickle cell is also performed using typical InceptionV3 model by using SoftMax layer. It is observed that the performance of the proposed system seems to be high when compared to the classification using the original InceptionV3 model. The results are validated by various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity and F1-score. The SVM classifier yields high accuracy of about 96%. The optimal subset of deep features along with SVM enhances the system performance in the proposed work. Thus, the proposed approach is appropriate for pathologists to take early clinical decisions on detection of sickle cells.
38167227		Successful Conservative Therapy for Infected Penile Implants: A Case Series.BACKGROUND Traditionally, penile implant infections have been treated by removal followed by immediate or delayed replacement. The use of antibiotics in conservative therapy has recently attracted attention. CASE REPORT We report our experience with 4 cases of infected penile implants managed conservatively. Case 1 was a 41-year-old with sickle cell anemia who presented with low-grade fever and purulent discharge that started 1 month postoperatively and lasted for 3 weeks. He had left graft after fibrotic tissue excision with 14-mm collection in the left corpus cavernosum. He was managed with IV pipracillin/tazobactam and vancomycin for 13 days. Follow-up after 23 weeks showed complete wound healing. Case 2 was a 62-year-old with diabetes who had purulent discharge that started 41 days postoperatively and lasted for 1 week. He received 5 days of IV vancomycin and gentamycin. Follow-up after 4 weeks showed marked improvement of the wound. Case 3 was a 61-year-old with diabetes and ischemic heart disease. He presented 30 days postoperatively with fever, purulent discharge for 5 days. He received a total of 10 days of IV vancomycin and gentamycin. Follow-up 3 weeks after discharge showed complete wound healing. Case 4 was a 61-year-old with diabetes and ischemic heart disease. He presented 1 month postoperatively with fever and pus discharge for 1 week. He completed 10 days of IV vancomycin and gentamycin. Follow-up after 1 week showed marked wound healing. CONCLUSIONS Choosing patients with early superficial infected penile prosthesis for conservative management should be tailored to selected patients who does not have leukocytosis, signs of sepsis, high-grade fever, or an exposed device.
36729452		Severe Maternal Morbidity and Mortality in Sickle Cell Disease in the National Inpatient Sample, 2012-2018.Importance: Pregnancy outcomes are historically poor among people with sickle cell disease (SCD) in the US, most of whom have Black race. Whether outcomes have improved is unknown. Objective: To tabulate adverse pregnancy outcomes among patients with SCD, comparing outcomes of deliveries among Black people with SCD with those of Black people without SCD and a control non-Black population, and to measure the association of racial disparities with adverse outcomes in SCD pregnancies. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study was a secondary analysis involving data from National Inpatient Sample, a nationally representative sample of 20% of acute hospital admissions in the US, between 2012 and 2018. The data set included all admissions with codes for delivery of a pregnancy among people aged 11 to 55 years. Data were analyzed from September 2021 to August 2022. Exposures: SCD, racial disparities. Main Outcomes and Measures: Severe maternal morbidity (SMM) as measured by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's index alongside other outcomes; multiple logistic regression was used to compare the odds for adverse pregnancy outcomes. Results: The sample included 5 401 899 deliveries, including 3901 deliveries among people with SCD and 742 164 deliveries among people with Black race. Compared with the non-Black control group, patients with SCD and Black patients were younger (mean [SD] age: SCD, 27.2 [5.9] years; Black, 27.1 [6.1] years vs 28.7 [5.9] years) and more likely to have public insurance (SCD, 2609 deliveries [67.3%]; Black, 496 828 deliveries [65.4%] vs 1 880 198 deliveries [40.8%]). The maternal mortality rate in deliveries among people with SCD was 26 times greater than in the non-Black control group and more than 10 times greater than among Black pregnant people without SCD (Per 10 000 deliveries: SCD 13.3; 95% CI, 5.7-31.2; Black race, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.0-1.5; non-Black control 0.5; 95% CI, 0.5-0.6). Compared with the control group, SCD deliveries had higher odds of SMM (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 7.22; 95% CI, 6.25-8.34; P < .001), especially cerebrovascular events (aOR, 22.00; 95% CI, 15.25-31.72; P < .001) and thromboembolism (aOR, 17.34; 95% CI, 11.55-26.03; P < .001). Racial disparities explained a median (IQR) 28.9% (21.2%-33.1%) of the increased risk in deliveries to people with SCD and between 40% and 50% of the increased risk for acute kidney failure (excess risk [ER], 56.9%; 95% CI, 54.3%-59.3%), intrauterine fetal demise (ER, 47.8%; 95% CI, 46.6%-49.1%), and eclampsia (ER, 42.1%; 95% CI, 37.9%-46.1%). Conclusions and Relevance: In this large cross-sectional study of pregnancy outcomes in people with SCD, the risk for SMM was higher compared with deliveries among people without SCD, especially for thrombotic events, organ failure, and death. Racial disparities were associated with adverse outcomes. Our findings compel scientific, clinical, and political effort to improve outcomes for pregnant people with SCD.
34118373		Acupuncture as an Adjunctive Treatment for Pain in Hospitalized Children With Sickle Cell Disease.CONTEXT: Acute episodes of pain associated with sickle cell disease (SCD) account for over 100,000 hospitalizations and expenses of nearly one billion dollars annually in the U.S. New treatment approaches are needed as the current opioid based therapy is often inadequate in controlling pain, resulting in prolonged inpatient stays, and high rates of readmission. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate acceptability of acupuncture as an adjunctive therapy and explore the impact of acupuncture on pain related outcomes in a population of youth with SCD hospitalized for management of acute pain. METHODS: This IRB approved single center study recruited youth with SCD (9-20 years) who were hospitalized for management of acute pain into either the acupuncture group or controls. Both groups also received standard pain management therapies. RESULTS: Participants in the acupuncture (n = 19) and control (n = 10) group were comparable in clinical characteristics. Acupuncture had an acceptability rate of over 66% and was tolerated well without any side effects. Acupuncture was associated with reduction in pain scores (6.84-5.51; P < 0.0001). Acupuncture group demonstrated a trend toward lower length of stay and readmission rates, but these were not statistically significant. Opioid use was not different between the groups. Treatment Evaluation Inventory survey showed high rates of satisfaction with acupuncture. CONCLUSION: Acupuncture was broadly accepted and well-tolerated in our study population. Acupuncture treatment was associated with a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in pain scores immediately following the treatments, and a trend towards a reduction in length of stay and readmission for pain.
33741926	associate|@CHEMICAL_Mannose|@DISEASE_Malaria ;interact|@CHEMICAL_Mannose|@GENE_MRC1 ;associate|@CHEMICAL_Mannose|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell	Red blood cell mannoses as phagocytic ligands mediating both sickle cell anaemia and malaria resistance.In both sickle cell disease and malaria, red blood cells (RBCs) are phagocytosed in the spleen, but receptor-ligand pairs mediating uptake have not been identified. Here, we report that patches of high mannose N-glycans (Man5-9GlcNAc2), expressed on diseased or oxidized RBC surfaces, bind the mannose receptor (CD206) on phagocytes to mediate clearance. We find that extravascular hemolysis in sickle cell disease correlates with high mannose glycan levels on RBCs. Furthermore, Plasmodium falciparum-infected RBCs expose surface mannose N-glycans, which occur at significantly higher levels on infected RBCs from sickle cell trait subjects compared to those lacking hemoglobin S. The glycans are associated with high molecular weight complexes and protease-resistant, lower molecular weight fragments containing spectrin. Recognition of surface N-linked high mannose glycans as a response to cellular stress is a molecular mechanism common to both the pathogenesis of sickle cell disease and resistance to severe malaria in sickle cell trait.
34256033		Metabolic bone diseases in sickle cell anemia patients and evaluation of associated factors.BACKGROUND: Metabolic or non-metabolic many bone diseases can be distinguished in sickle cell anemia. Patients with sickle cell anemia have a high risk of osteopenia and osteoporosis. The aim of this study is to reveal bone mineral density abnormalities and related factors in patients with sickle cell anemia. METHODS: A total of 70 patients with sickle cell anemia were retrospectively included in our study. Complete blood count (CBC) parameters, serum creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, uric acid, calcium, phosphorus, parathormone, alkaline phosphatase, 25 (OH) vitamin D, ferritin, C reactive protein (CRP) and calculated bone mineral densitometry measurements by Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) were assessed and recorded to the statistics program. We diagnosed osteopenia and osteoporosis according to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. To determine the status of avascular necrosis and bone fracture, we examined x-ray and magnetic resonance imaging reports and epicrisis reports of patients from the records. RESULTS: The average age was 30.01 +- 8.64 years. Eighteen (26.5%) of the 68 patients whose Z-score was evaluated by DEXA had bone mass below the expected age-related range according to the Z score, while 50 (73.5%) had bone mass within the expected age-related range. Of the patients whose T score was evaluated by DEXA, 46.8% were normal (n=29), 45.1% were osteopenic (n=28) and 8.1% were osteoporotic (n=5). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with sickle cell anemia are at increased risk for osteoporosis, osteopenia, and osteomalacia. Bone health should be emphasized in these patients.
36206076		Global perspectives on cellular therapy for children with sickle cell disease.PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), primarily in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), predominantly experience the burden of sickle cell disease (SCD). High frequency of acute and chronic complications leads to increased utilization of healthcare, which burdens fragile health systems. Mortality for children with limited healthcare access remains alarmingly high. Cellular based therapies such as allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) are increasingly used in resource-rich settings as curative therapy for SCD. Broad access to curative therapies for SCD in SSA would dramatically alter the global impact of the disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Currently, application of cellular based therapies in LMICs is limited by cost, personnel, and availability of HSCT-specific technologies and supportive care. Despite the challenges, HSCT for SCD is moving forward in LMICs. Highly anticipated gene modification therapies have recently proven well tolerated and feasible in clinical trials in resource-rich countries, but access remains extremely limited. SUMMARY: Translation of curative cellular based therapies for SCD should be prioritized to LMICs where the disease burden and cost of noncurative treatments is high, and long-term quality of life is poor. Focus on thoughtful modifications of current and future therapies to meet the need in LMICs, especially in SSA, will be especially impactful.
36351365		The Development and Consequences of Red Blood Cell Alloimmunization.While red blood cell (RBC) transfusion is the most common medical intervention in hospitalized patients, as with any therapeutic, it is not without risk. Allogeneic RBC exposure can result in recipient alloimmunization, which can limit the availability of compatible RBCs for future transfusions and increase the risk of transfusion complications. Despite these challenges and the discovery of RBC alloantigens more than a century ago, relatively little has historically been known regarding the immune factors that regulate RBC alloantibody formation. Through recent epidemiological approaches, in vitro-based translational studies, and newly developed preclinical models, the processes that govern RBC alloimmunization have emerged as more complex and intriguing than previously appreciated. Although common alloimmunization mechanisms exist, distinct immune pathways can be engaged, depending on the target alloantigen involved. Despite this complexity, key themes are beginning to emerge that may provide promising approaches to not only actively prevent but also possibly alleviate the most severe complications of RBC alloimmunization.

Two DNMT1-depleting agents 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (aza-dCyd, decitabine) and 5-aza-cytidine (aza-Cyd, azacitidine) are currently used for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia and have also been investigated for nononcology indications, such as sickle cell disease. However, these agents have several off-target activities leading to significant toxicities that limit dosing and duration of treatment. Development of more selective inhibitors of DNMT1 could therefore afford treatment of long durations at effective doses. We have discovered that 5-aza-4'-thio-2'-deoxycytidine (aza-T-dCyd) is as effective as aza-dCyd in depleting DNMT1 in mouse tumor models but with markedly low toxicity. In this review we describe the preclinical studies that led to the development of aza-T-dCyd as a superior DNMT1-depleting agent with respect to aza-dCyd and will describe its pharmacology, metabolism, and mechanism of action. In an effort to understand why aza-T-dCyd is a more selective DNMT1 depleting agent than aza-dCyd, we will also compare and contrast the activities of these two agents. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Aza-T-dCyd is a potent DNMT1-depleting agent. Although similar in structure to decitabine (aza-dCyd), its metabolism and mechanism of action is different than that of aza-dCyd, resulting in less off-target activity and less toxicity. The larger therapeutic index of aza-T-dCyd (DNMT1 depletion vs. toxicity) in mice suggests that it would be a better clinical candidate to selectively deplete DNMT1 from target cells and determine whether or not depletion of DNMT1 is an effective target for various diseases.

In adults co-administration of hydroxyurea and L-Arginine in adult sufferers of SCD had shown some benefits. This study examined the effect of co-administration of hydroxyurea (15-35mg/kg/day) and L-Arginine (500 mg/day) for 6 weeks on blood pressure, haematological parameters, liver and antioxidant enzymes levels. The levels of these parameters when the subjects were on hydroxyurea alone were taken as control values. Results showed that the combined therapy (HU + L-Arginine) decreased SBP, DBP, MAP and PP (p <0.01 in each case) but increased %HbF, Hb and PCV (p< o.001 in each case). It elevated CAT, SOD, GPX (p < 0.001 in each case) but depressed MDA, AST, ALT and ALP (p < 0.001 in each case). The study shows that L-Arginine used as an adjunct to hydroxyurea therapy may be beneficial to children suffering from sickle cell anaemia.

Accordingly, SWI/SNF defects affecting different subunits of the complex became defining genetic features in the nosology of different neoplastic entities. In the kidney, loss of SMARCB1(INI1) as a major component of the SWI/SNF complex has emerged as the defining genetic marker for renal medullary carcinoma and pediatric malignant rhabdoid tumor. Diagnosis of these two rare entities is based on a set of defined demographic, clinicopathological, immunophenotypic, and genetic (SMARCB1 loss) criteria. Moreover, the sickle cell trait is considered a prerequisite for renal medullary carcinoma. Current knowledge illustrates that SMARCB1 loss is encountered in three major tumor categories in the kidney: (1) histologically defined neoplasms that are primarily driven by de novo SMARCB1 loss (renal medullary carcinoma and malignant rhabdoid tumor); (2) SMRACB1-deficient renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with variable non-specific histology ranging from collecting duct-like, papillary high-grade (papillary type 2), or medullary-like (lacking sickle cell trait), to fully undifferentiated; and (3) biphasic (dedifferentiated) RCC showing a variable SMARCB1-deficient undifferentiated component. The latter variant most frequently originates from pre-existing clear cell RCC but may rarely superimpose on papillary or chromophobe RCC. This review summarizes the major defining features of the emerging SMARCB1-deficient renal neoplasms. All SMARCB1-deficient carcinomas have a poor prognosis in common. Therefore, exact diagnosis of these tumors is a prerequisite for studies investigating new therapies.
33711512		Pain in sickle cell disease: current and potential translational therapies.Pain is a major comorbidity of sickle cell disease (SCD). Patients with SCD may suffer from both acute and chronic pain. Acute pain is caused by recurrent and unpredictable episodes of vaso-occlusive crises (VOC), whereas the exact etiology of chronic pain is still unknown. Opioids are the mainstay for pain treatment, but the opioid epidemic has significantly altered access to prescription opioids and has brought concerns over their long-term use into the forefront, which have negatively impacted the treatment of sickle pain. Opioids remain potent analgesics but growing opioid-phobia has led to the realization of an unmet need to develop nonopioid therapies that can provide relief for severe sickle pain. This realization has contributed to the approval of 3 different drugs by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of SCD, particularly to reduce VOC and/or have an impact on the pathobiology of SCD. In this review, we outline the challenges and need for validation of side-effects of opioids and provide an update on the development of mechanism-based translational therapies, specifically targeting pain in SCD.
36539362		Challenges and opportunities in shared care for international patients treated with cellular therapy for nonmalignant disease.As cellular therapies gradually become the mainstay of treatment for several nonmalignant diseases, there appears to be varied accessibility to these therapies globally. Despite considerable burden of nonmalignant conditions, such as sickle cell disease, thalassemia, and aplastic anemia in populations of low-middle-income countries, the utilization of cellular therapies remain sparse because of lack of resources. Globally, the frequency of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) has increased disproportionately in countries with higher gross national income (GNI) per capita, governmental healthcare expenditures, and a high human development index. This leads to a large subset of international patients seeking care in the United States. This review summarizes the unique set of challenges that often arise when offering sophisticated therapies such as HSCT to international patients constituting of cross-cultural, logistical, financial, and medical challenges and the opportunities that are available to bridge the gap.

34469415		Decision-Making Involvement, Self-Efficacy, and Transition Readiness in Youth With Sickle Cell Disease.BACKGROUND: Transition to adult healthcare is a critical time for adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with sickle cell disease, and preparation for transition is important to reducing morbidity and mortality risks associated with transition. OBJECTIVE: We explored the relationships between decision-making involvement, self-efficacy, healthcare responsibility, and overall transition readiness in AYAs with sickle cell disease prior to transition. METHODS: This cross-sectional, correlational study was conducted with 50 family caregivers-AYAs dyads receiving care from a large comprehensive sickle cell clinic between October 2019 and February 2020. Participants completed the Decision-Making Involvement Scale, the Sickle Cell Self-Efficacy Scale, and the Readiness to Transition Questionnaire. Multiple linear regression was used to assess the relationships between decision-making involvement, self-efficacy, healthcare responsibility, and overall transition readiness in AYAs with sickle cell disease prior to transition to adult healthcare. RESULTS: Whereas higher levels of expressive behaviors, such as sharing opinions and ideas in decision-making, were associated with higher levels of AYA healthcare responsibility, those behaviors were inversely associated with feelings of overall transition readiness. Self-efficacy was positively associated with overall transition readiness but inversely related to AYA healthcare responsibility. Parent involvement was negatively associated with AYA healthcare responsibility and overall transition readiness. DISCUSSION: While increasing AYAs' decision-making involvement may improve AYAs' healthcare responsibility, it may not reduce barriers of feeling unprepared for the transition to adult healthcare. Facilitating active AYA involvement in decision-making regarding disease management, increasing self-efficacy, and safely reducing parent involvement may positively influence their confidence and capacity for self-management.
37450055		Age-related differences in risks and outcomes of 30-day readmission in adults with sickle cell disease.BACKGROUND: Literature on 30-day readmission in adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) is limited. This study examined the overall and age-stratified rates, risk factors, and healthcare resource utilization associated with 30-day readmission in this population. METHODS: Using the Nationwide Readmissions Database, a retrospective cohort study was conducted to identify adult patients (aged >= 18) with SCD in 2016. Patients were stratified by age and followed for 30 days to assess readmission following an index discharge. The primary outcome was 30-day unplanned all-cause readmission. Secondary outcomes included index hospitalization costs and readmission outcomes (e.g., time to readmission, readmission costs, and readmission lengths of stay). Separate generalized linear mixed models estimated the adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for associations of readmission with patient and hospital characteristics, overall and by age. RESULTS: Of 15,167 adults with SCD, 2,863 (18.9%) experienced readmission. Both the rates and odds of readmission decreased with increasing age. The SCD complications vaso-occlusive crisis and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) were significantly associated with increased likelihood of readmission (p < 0.05). Age-stratified analyses demonstrated that diagnosis of depression significantly increased risk of readmission among patients aged 18-to-29 years (aOR = 1.537, 95%CI: 1.215-1.945) but not among patients of other ages. All secondary outcomes significantly differed by age (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that patients with SCD are at very high risk of 30-day readmission and that younger adults and those with vaso-occlusive crisis and ESRD are among those at highest risk. Multifaceted, age-specific interventions targeting individuals with SCD on disease management are needed to prevent readmissions.
38422317		Transfusion of packed red blood cells in adults with sickle cell anemia treated at an emergency hospital.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze the prescription of packed red blood cells performed by emergency physicians for adults with sickle cell anemia. METHODS: Transfusions performed in adults with sickle cell anemia treated at an emergency service in Sao Bernardo do Campo, Sao Paulo Brazil, between January 2018 and January 2022 were evaluated. For data comparison, the chi-square2 test was used. The significance level adopted was 5%. RESULTS: A total of 114 transfusions were performed. The mean age was 41.8+-16.4 years, and pretransfusion hemoglobin was 6.1+-1.23 g/dL. Regarding the indication, the adequacy of transfusions performed in symptomatic individuals was significantly higher compared to asymptomatic individuals (100% vs. 3.9%, p<0.001). Symptomatic individuals received excessive volumes of packed red blood cells less frequently than asymptomatic individuals (17.5% vs. 56.9%, p<0.001). The filtered subtype, indicated for sickle cell anemia, was prescribed in only a quarter of the patients. However, non-indicated subtypes were frequently prescribed. CONCLUSION: This study found low adequacy in the indication and calculation of the transfusion volume of packed red blood cells in asymptomatic individuals. Few patients received filtered red blood cells, resulting in increased risks of transfusion reactions. On the contrary, non-indicated subtypes were prescribed in a quarter of transfusions, which resulted in higher costs and delay in receiving packed red blood cells.
34152394		Measures to reduce red cell use in patients with sickle cell disease requiring red cell exchange during a blood shortage.The COVID-19 pandemic has created major disruptions in health care delivery, including a severe blood shortage. The inventory of Rh and K antigen-negative red cell units recommended for patients with hemoglobinopathies became alarmingly low and continues to be strained. Because patients with sickle cell disease requiring chronic red cell exchange (RCE) incur a large demand for red cell units, we hypothesized that implementation of 2 measures could reduce blood use. First, obtaining the pretransfusion hemoglobin S (HbS) results by procedure start time would facilitate calculation of exact red cell volume needed to achieve the desired post-RCE HbS. Second, as a short-term conservation method, we identified patients for whom increasing the targeted end procedure hematocrit up to 5 percentage points higher than the pretransfusion level (no higher than 36%) was not medically contraindicated. The goal was to enhance suppression of endogenous erythropoiesis and thereby reduce the red cell unit number needed to maintain the same target HbS%. These 2 measures resulted in an 18% reduction of red cell units transfused to 50 patients undergoing chronic RCE during the first 6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite reduction of blood use, pretransfusion HbS% target goals were maintained and net iron accumulation was low. Both strategies can help alleviate a shortage of Rh and K antigen-negative red cells, and, more generally, transfusing red cell units based on precise red cell volume required can optimize patient care and judicious use of blood resources.
34400054		Therapeutic approach to pediatric patients with acute chest syndrome: national multicenter survey of non invasive ventilation (NIV) and transfusion.BACKGROUND: Intensive care units (ICUs) have seen a spike in the use of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) for many medical conditions. We sought to investigate the attitudes and clinical practice regarding the management of acute chest syndrome (ACS) with a focus on NIV in pediatric ICUs. METHOD: Members of the French Group for Pediatric Intensive Care Emergencies (GFRUP) were asked to complete an online survey on physicians' attitudes toward children with ACS admitted to the PICU during 2015. RESULTS: The survey was answered by teams from 17 PICUs (240 beds). In total, 15 centers (88%) had a local transfusion unit and 14 (82%) worked in connection with a sickle cell disease (SCD) reference center. During 2015, 360 patients with SCD were managed (median: 7 per center; 21) of whom 137 (38%) for an ACS (median: 4 ACS per center; 8). The median length of PICU stay for ACS was 5 days (3.1). Among the 137 patients who presented with ACS, 73 (53%) received simple blood transfusion and 16 (12%) received exchange transfusion. For patients who required noninvasive ventilatory support, NIV with bilevel pressure (BiPAP) was the most frequent method (n = 68, 50%), followed by continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) (n = 23, 17%) and high-flow oxygen (n = 21, 15%). The proportion of patients on BiPAP was up to 71% in the centers most frequently managing ACS patients. CONCLUSION: BiPAP is commonly used in PICUs for SCD patients with ACS, especially in trained centers. Future physiological studies and randomized controlled trials might help to choose the best ventilatory support for ACS.
37728227		Potential for a large-scale newborn screening strategy for sickle cell disease in Mali: A comparative diagnostic performance study of two rapid diagnostic tests (SickleScan  and HemotypeSC ) on cord blood.Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a life-threatening disease requiring reliable early diagnosis. We assessed the acceptability and diagnostic performances of two rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) to identify SCD (HbSS, HbSC, HbS/beta-thalassaemia) or SCD carrier (HbS/HbC) in a pilot SCD newborn screening (NBS) strategy in Mali. All consenting delivering women were offered SCD NBS using cord blood sampling on two RDTs (SickleScan  and HemotypeSC ) compared to the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) gold standard to detect SCD states. From April 2021 to August 2021, 4333 delivering women were eligible of whom 96.1% were offered NBS: 1.6% refused, 13.8% delivered before consenting and 84.6% consented; 3648 newborns were diagnosed by HPLC; 1.64% had SCD (0.63% HbSS, 0.85% HbSC, 0.16 HbS/beta-plus-thalassaemia); 21.79% were SCD carrier. To detect accurately SCD, SickleScan  had a sensitivity of 81.67% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 71.88-91.46) and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 99.69% (95% CI: 99.51-99.87); HemotypeSC  had a sensitivity of 78.33% (95% CI: 67.91-88.76) and a NPV of 99.64% (95% CI: 99.44-99.83). To detect SCD carrier: SickleScan  sensitivity was 96.10% (95% CI: 94.75-97.45) and NPV, 98.90% (95% CI: 98.51-99.29); HemotypeSC  sensitivity was 95.22% (95% CI: 93.74-96.70) and NPV, 98.66% (95% CI: 98.24-99.03). Routine SCD NBS was acceptable. Compared with HPLC, both RDTs had reliable diagnostic performances to exclude SCD-free newborns and to identify SCD carriers to be further confirmed. This strategy could be implemented in large-scale NBS programmes.
34090916		Differences between children with severe acute lower respiratory infection with or without SARS-Cov-2 infection.AIM: to compare clinical features and outcome of children with severe acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) with or without SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU). METHODS: for this retrospective cohort study, all children aged<17 years admitted with severe ALRI at a PICU, in Salvador, Brazil were evaluated. Investigation of SARS-CoV-2 infection was performed by real-time reverse-transcription PCR. Clinical data, physical findings upon admission and outcome were registered. Patients were categorized by with or without SARS-Cov-2 infection. Outcomes were death and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). RESULTS: we enrolled 210 patients, whose median age was 2.8 years (IQR: 7.1 months-6.2 years). IMV was used in 33 (15.7%; 95%CI 11.3%-21.1%) patients. Eight (3.8%; 95%CI 1.8%-7.1%) cases died. 62 patients (29.5%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Male gender (67.7% vs. 52.7%, P = 0.045) and sickle cell disease (6.5% vs. 0%, P = 0.007) were associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Wheezing upon admission was more common in patients without SARS-CoV-2 infection (38.5% vs. 21.0%, P = 0.01). IMV was more frequent among patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection (25.8% vs. 11.5%, P = 0.009) as well as death (8.1% vs. 2.0%, P = 0.05). CONCLUSION: children with severe ALRI infection with SARS-CoV-2 need IMV more frequently than those without it.

While hyaluronic acid (HA) has been used in the adult population for shoulder osteoarthritic pain, we present the first published pediatric case of HA injections in the glenohumeral joint, used to improve function and pain control. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient is a 12-year-old woman with SCD, who suffered from chronic pain due to AVN of the humeral and femoral head. Despite engaging in a multidisciplinary pain management plan, she continued to have severe decline in physical functioning and became a wheelchair user. As a result, she was scheduled for a right total hip arthroplasty, which necessitated aggressive postoperative therapies using the glenohumeral joint. To improve this pain and to facilitate postoperative recovery, the patient underwent 4 weekly HA injections into the glenohumeral joint. Over a 2-month period, the patient was able to improve physical functioning, decrease opiate use and participate in all postoperative therapies. CONCLUSION: Conservative options to improve functioning and pain are especially important in pediatric patients where it may be desirable to delay surgical interventions until skeletal maturity. Our case report demonstrates the benefits of intra-articular HA as part of a multidisciplinary pain management plan to improve function and decrease pain related to AVN of the humeral head. Future studies should assess the long-term benefits of HA injections for AVN in the setting of SCD.
35417940	cause|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Hypertrophy_Left_Ventricular ;cause|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Cardiovascular_Diseases ;treat|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell	Factors associated with left ventricular hypertrophy in children with sickle cell disease: results from the DISPLACE study.Cardiopulmonary complications remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in sickle cell disease (SCD). The overall goals of this study were to evaluate the relationship between left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and laboratory markers of hemolysis and determine the association between LVH and SCD-specific therapies (hydroxyurea and chronic red cell transfusion). Data from the DISPLACE (Dissemination and Implementation of Stroke Prevention Looking at the Care Environment) study cohort was used. LVH was defined based on the left ventricular mass indexed to the body surface area as left ventricular mass index >103.0 g/m2 for males and >84.2 g/m2 for females. There were 1,409 children included in the analysis and 20.3% had LVH. Results of multivariable analysis of LVH showed baseline hemoglobin levels were associated with the lower odds of having LVH (odds ratio [OR]: 0.71, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.60- 0.84). The odds of LVH increases for every 1-year increase in age (OR: 1.07, 95% CI: 1.02-1.13). Similarly, the odds of LVH were lower among males than females (OR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.38-0.93). The odds of LVH were higher among those on hydroxyurea compared to no therapy (OR: 1.83, 95% CI: 1.41-2.37). Overall results of the study showed that LVH occurs early in children with SCD and the risk increases with increasing age and with lower hemoglobin. Further, we found higher use of hydroxyurea among those with LVH, suggesting that the need for hydroxyurea conveys a risk of cardiovascular remodeling.
38394231		Sickle Cell Disease in an Older Adult Population: A Retrospective Review of Health Care Resource Utilization.Sickle cell disease (SCD) has a history of health inequity, as patients with SCD are primarily Black and often marginalized from the health care system. Although recent health care and treatment advancements have prolonged life expectancy, it may be insufficient to support the complex needs of the growing population of older adults with SCD. This retrospective study used a cohort (N = 812) of Medicare Advantage beneficiaries 45 years and older (ages: 45-54, 55-64, 65-74, 75-89) with SCD to identify associations of SCD-related complications and comorbidities with emergency department (ED) visits, potentially avoidable ED visits, all-cause hospitalization, and potentially avoidable hospitalizations, 2018-2020. The 75-89 age group had lower odds of an ED visit (OR 0.56; 95% CI 0.32-1.00), 65-74 age group had lower odds of an ED visit (OR 0.49; 95% CI 0.31-0.78) and hospitalization (OR 0.50; 95% CI 0.31-0.79), compared with the 45-54 age group. Acute chest syndrome was associated with increased odds of an ED visit (OR 2.02; 95% CI 1.10-3.71), avoidable ED visit (OR 1.87; 95% CI 1.14-3.06), and hospitalization (OR 3.61; 95% CI 2.06-6.31). Pain was associated with increased odds of an ED visit (OR 2.64; 95% CI 1.85-3.76), an avoidable ED visit (OR 3.08; 95% CI 1.90-4.98), hospitalization (OR 1.51; 95% CI 1.02-2.24), and avoidable hospitalization (OR 6.42; 95% CI 1.74-23.74). Older adults with SCD have been living with SCD for decades, often while managing pain crises and complications associated increased incidence of an ED visit and hospitalization. The characteristics and needs of this population must continue to be examined to increase preventative care and reduce costly emergent health care resource utilization.
36007198		Paracentral Acute Middle Maculopathy with Sickle Cell Trait.PURPOSE: To report a case of paracentral acute middle maculopathy in a pediatric patient with sickle cell trait. METHODS: The patient was evaluated with a comprehensive ophthalmic examination, optical coherence tomography (OCT), optical coherence tomography angiography, and fluorescein angiography. RESULTS: Acute loss of vision occurred immediately after an uneventful scleral buckling procedure for retinal detachment in a 16-year-old female. Retinal imaging studies confirmed the occurrence of paracentral acute middle maculopathy (PAMM), an ischemic condition characterized by infarction of the inner nuclear layer of the retina caused by hypoperfusion of the intermediate and deep capillary plexuses. Laboratory evaluation was only remarkable for sickle cell trait. Over a course of 3 months after the loss of vision, visual acuity improved from 20/1000 to 20/20, and OCT lesion resolved to a parafoveal area of inner and middle retinal layer thinning. Paracentral scotoma corresponding to the atrophic area persisted. CONCLUSION: Dehydration due to the presurgical non-per-os (NPO) status and transient increase in intraocular pressure during the buckling surgery may have predisposed this patient with sickle cell trait to a sickling event that caused localized ischemia in the middle retina's end-capillaries. Avoiding long NPO status, being mindful of transient intraocular pressure elevation during scleral buckling procedures, and presurgical hemoglobin electrophoresis in at-risk populations are recommended to prevent sickling attacks during retinal surgeries in individuals with sickle cell trait.
36602417		Time to pain relief: A randomized controlled trial in the emergency department during vaso-occlusive episodes in sickle cell disease.OBJECTIVE: Compare time to pain relief (minimum of a 13 mm and 30% reduction) during an Emergency Department (ED) visit among patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) experiencing severe pain associated with a vaso-occlusive episode who were randomized to receive either an individualized or weight-based pain protocol. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial in two EDs. Adults with sickle cell disease. Research staff recorded pain scores every 30 min during an ED visit (up to 6 h in the ED) using a 0-100 mm visual analogue scale. Analysis included 122 visits, representing 49 patients (individualized: 61 visits, 25 patients; standard: 61 visits, 24 patients). RESULTS: Pain reduction across 6-h was greater for the individualized compared to the standard protocol (protocol-by-time: p = .02; 6-h adjusted pain score comparison: Individualized: M = 29.2, SD = 38.8, standard: M = 45.3, SD = 35.6; p = .03, Cohen d = 0.43). Hazards models indicated a greater probability of 13 mm (HR = 1.54, 95% CI = 1.05, 2.27, p = .03) and 30% (HR = 1.71, 95% CI = 1.11, 2.63, p = .01) reduction in the individualized relative to the standard protocol. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who received treatment with an individualized protocol experienced a more rapid reduction in pain, including a 13 mm and 30% reduction in pain scores when compared to those that received weight-based dosing.
35132969		Revascularization Is Associated With a Reduced Stroke Risk in Patients With Sickle Cell-Associated Moyamoya Syndrome.BACKGROUND: Moyamoya syndrome refers to a progressive stenosis of the internal carotid arteries and can be associated with sickle cell disease. These codiagnoses result in severe risk for stroke, even in patients on optimal medical management. Surgical revascularization has been shown to be safe in small case series. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of revascularization with direct comparison to a medically managed control group within a single institution. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of medically managed vs surgically revascularized patients with moyamoya syndrome and sickle cell disease was conducted. Demographic data and outcomes including the number of prediagnosis, postdiagnosis, and postrevascularization strokes were collected. Risk factors for stroke were identified using a binary logistic regression model, and stroke rates and mortality between groups were compared. RESULTS: Of the 29 identified patients, 66% were medically managed and 34% underwent surgical revascularization (50% direct and 50% indirect). Calculated stroke rates were 1 per 5.37 (medical management), 1 per 3.43 (presurgical revascularization), and 1 per 23.14 patient-years (postsurgical revascularization). There was 1 surgical complication with no associated permanent deficits. No risk factors for stroke after time of diagnosis were found to be significant. CONCLUSION: The results of this study demonstrate that revascularization is associated with a significant reduction in stroke risk, both relative to prerevascularization rates and compared with medical management. According to these findings, surgical revascularization offers a safe and durable preventative therapy for stroke and should be pursued aggressively in this patient population.
38082534		Hoping for a normal life: Decision-making on hematopoietic stem cell transplantation by patients with a hemoglobinopathy and their caregivers.BACKGROUND: To provide insight into the perspectives of children and young adults with transfusion-dependent thalassemia and sickle cell disease and their caregivers regarding the decision for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). PROCEDURE: A qualitative longitudinal multicenter study. Data collection consisted of 40 audio-recorded conversations between physicians and families and 77 interviews with patients and/or caregivers related to 27 unique cases, collected at different time points throughout the decision-making process. RESULTS: Conversations and interviews revealed "hoping for a normal life" as an overarching theme, consisting of four main topics: (i) "Building a frame of reference" refers to a process where patients or families try to obtain comprehensive information on HSCT and translate this to their situation to decide. (ii) "Balancing between loss and benefit" reports the process of considering the advantages and disadvantages of continuing with supportive care to treat their disease versus choosing HSCT. (iii) "Experiencing the impact of HSCT" describes the impactfull experience of the HSCT period by those who chose HSCT. (iv) "Balancing again" refers to reflecting on the decision made. CONCLUSIONS: The hope for a normal life guided the decision-making process, described as a constant balance between the impact of the disease and HSCT. A structured approach to explore patients' and caregivers' perspectives on HSCT decision-making is needed, where specifically discussing the impact of the disease and hope for a normal life need to be integrated in the process.

34031999		Psychosocial risk and health care utilization in pediatric sickle cell disease.INTRODUCTION: Pain and complications related to pediatric sickle cell disease (SCD) are associated with higher health care utilization. In other pediatric chronic conditions, psychosocial screening can help identify children and families at risk of increased health care utilization to guide resource allocation, address treatment needs, and improve care. This study aimed to investigate the utility of psychosocial screening in predicting increased health care utilization among youth with SCD. METHODS: Youth with SCD (n = 74, 8-18 years) and their parents were recruited from comprehensive SCD clinics. Parents completed the Psychosocial Assessment Tool (PAT), which categorized family psychosocial risk into one of three categories: Universal (minimal distress), Targeted (elevated distress), and Clinical (persistent distress). Youth reported on their pain characteristics, and health care utilization was extracted from medical chart review. Differences in health care utilization were evaluated using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and moderation analyses. RESULTS: Based on PAT risk, families were categorized into Universal (56.8%), Targeted (29.7%), and Clinical (13.5%) risk groups, with no significant group differences across demographic variables. Patients in the Targeted group reported significantly higher pain frequency than those in the Universal group (F[2, 66] = 3.7, p < .05). The association between pain frequency and health care utilization significantly varied on the basis of psychosocial risk, such that Clinical psychosocial risk strengthened the connection between pain frequency and health care utilization (beta = .2, t = 2.1, p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Integrating the PAT into routine clinical care may help health care providers identify families in need of greater psychosocial or medical support to further optimize SCD management.
38302122	associate|@DISEASE_Hemoglobin_C_Disease|@GENE_HBB	Curative Therapies for Sickle Cell Disease.Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an autosomal recessive hemoglobinopathy that affects individuals worldwide. The mutation in the beta-globin gene leads to abnormal hemoglobin production, sickle hemoglobin, which polymerizes under stress leading to, among other end-organ manifestations, chronic hemolytic anemia, debilitating vaso-occlusive crises, and stroke. Unfortunately, chronic stress on end-organs impacts the life expectancy of patients with SCD, which in the United States averages 43 years, approximately 36 years less than people without the disease. Here, we review the progress made in curative interventions for those with SCD, namely allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation and gene therapy. These interventions continue to evolve as we better understand SCD pathophysiology, use new graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis regimens, expand stem cell donor options, and understand the genetic control of hemoglobin production. Although significant progress has been made, many gaps remain in the successful implementation of these interventions globally and for all patients. [Pediatr Ann. 2024;53(2):e56-e61.].
35767590		Evaluation of Guideline-Recommended Pain Management in Acute Sickle Cell Crisis and Its Effect on Patient Outcomes.This was a retrospective, multi-site observational cohort of 233 encounters of patients with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) who received analgesia for acute pain crisis related to SCD from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019. Patient encounters were categorized based on whether they received analgesia within guideline directed 60 minutes of emergency department (ED) arrival. The primary outcome was time to a pain score reduction of >=30% on the numerical rating scale. Assessments were also conducted for potential disparities leading to suboptimal care. Time to pain score reduction of >=30% was significantly less in those receiving analgesia within 60 minutes of arrival compared to delayed analgesia [3.5 hours (2.5-10) vs 8.0 hours (4.5-22.5), p < 0.001]. Patients receiving timely analgesia also saw a faster time to ED disposition and achieved pain reduction goals more frequently at hospital discharge. We found that patients with a history of substance use disorder documented in their chart were less likely to receive timely analgesia. Our study indicated that when patients with SCD received analgesia in accordance with guideline recommendations, pain goals were achieved faster with an improvement in outcomes. Providing optimal care can be difficult, but education and standardized policies may help mitigate this gap.

Cerebrovascular disease is among the most common and debilitating complications of SCA, with 53% experiencing silent cerebral infarct by age 30 and 3.8% experiencing overt stroke by age 40 years. This review highlights the burden of cerebrovascular disease in SCD, including both stroke and silent cerebral infarct (SCI). We then discuss the pathophysiology of stroke and cerebral fat embolism in the absence of a patent foramen ovale. This review also reveals that options for primary and secondary stroke prevention in SCD are still limited to hydroxyurea and blood transfusion, and that the role of aspirin and anticoagulation in SCD stroke has not been adequately studied. Limited data suggest that the novel disease-modifying agents for SCD management may improve renal dysfunction, leg ulcers, and lower the abnormally high TCD flow velocity. Further research is urgently needed to investigate their role in stroke prevention in SCD, as these novel agents target the main stroke contributors in SCD - hemolysis and vaso-occlusion. This literature review also explores the role of healthcare disparities in slowing progress in SCD management and research in the United States, highlighting the need for more investment in patient and clinician education, SCD management, and research.
33975503	cause|@CHEMICAL_Iron|@DISEASE_Iron_Overload ;associate|@CHEMICAL_Iron|@GENE_HAMP ;cause|@CHEMICAL_Iron|@DISEASE_Metabolic_Diseases	Ferroportin-inhibitor salt: patent evaluation WO2018192973.INTRODUCTION: Iron is a crucial element necessary for blood formation in the body and its normal growth. However, irregular metabolism of iron due to absence of an elimination mechanism may deposit excess iron in the organs (iron overload) leading to metabolic disorders. Interactions between the iron regulatory peptide hormone, hepcidin and the iron exporter ferroportin plays major role in regulating the iron metabolism. Mutations in the ferroportin encoding genes, and dysregulation of hepsidin production often results in iron overload resulting in conditions like hemochromatosis, beta-thalassemia, and sickle cell anemia. Until today, there is no efficacious treatment available for managing iron overload targeting ferroportin inhibition via oral administration. AREAS COVERED: Novel salts of substituted benzoimidazole compounds useful for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of iron overload are claimed. These compounds act as hepcidin mimetic and inhibit the ferroportin thereby preventing iron overload. The claimed actives are useful in the treatment of disease conditions such as neurodegenerative and cardiac diseases triggered by iron overload. Preclinical studies of these salts on mouse model are also discussed. EXPERT OPINION: Prevention and/or treatment of iron overload is critical. The claimed compounds are the first oral drug candidate to treat iron overload and reach the pre-clinical development stage.
34127555		Diffuse cystic lung disease in sickle cell anaemia: a series of 22 cases and a case-control study.Chronic interstitial lung abnormalities have been described in sickle cell disease (SCD) and attributed to repetitive episode of acute chest syndrome. We report a series of 22 cases of diffuse cystic lung disease in SCD with a case-control study to hunt for mechanism. On pathological analysis of a surgical lung biopsy of the index case, the bronchioles had the appearance of constrictive bronchiolitis. Pulmonary function test results revealed lower forced expiratory flow from 25% to 75% of vital capacity in cases versus controls. These findings suggest a bronchiolar mechanism that was not associated with more acute chest syndrome.

34131897		Time to rethink haemoglobin threshold guidelines in sickle cell disease.Alleviating anaemia in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) is crucial in managing acute complications, mitigating end-organ damage and preventing early mortality. Some disease-modifying and curative therapies have increased haemoglobin (Hb) levels to exceed 100 g/l, a threshold above which complications from red blood cell (RBC) transfusions have occurred, raising concern about whole-blood viscosity-related complications with these therapies. Here we discuss the rationale behind this limit, the effect of viscosity on blood flow and the applicability of this Hb threshold to therapies for SCD beyond RBC transfusions.

36884065		Estimated glomerular filtration rate in Brazilian adults with sickle cell disease: results from the REDS-III multicenter cohort study.Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has a significant impact on sickle cell disease (SCD) morbidity and mortality. Early identification of individuals at highest risk of developing CKD may allow therapeutic intervention to prevent worse outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence and risk factors for reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) among adults with SCD in Brazil. Participants in the REDS-III multicenter SCD cohort with more severe genotypes aged >= 18 years with at least two serum creatinine values were analyzed. The eGFR was calculated using the Jamaica Sickle Cell Cohort Study GFR equation. The eGFR categories were defined according to the K/DOQI. Participants with eGFR >= 90 were compared to those with those with eGFR < 90. Among the 870 participants, 647 (74.4%) had eGFR >= 90, 211 (24.3%) had eGFR 60 to 89, six (0.7%) had eGFR 30 to 59, and six (0.7%) had ESRD. Male sex (OR: 37.3; 95%CI: 22.4-65.1), higher age (OR: 1.04; 95%CI: 1.02-1.06), higher diastolic blood pressure (OR: 1.03; 95%CI: 1.009-1.06), lower Hb (OR: 0.80; 95%CI: 0.68-0.93), and lower reticulocytes (OR: 0.94; 95%CI: 0.89-0.99) levels were independently associated with eGFR < 90. There was a trend towards higher odds of death in participants with eGFR < 90 (OR: 1.8; 95%CI: 0.95-3.32; p = 0.065). In turn, participants with eGFR < 60 had a 12.2 (95%CI: 2.1-96.9) times higher odds for death when compared to those with eGFR >= 60. In this study, eGFR < 90 was observed in one-quarter of adults. Older age, male sex, higher diastolic blood pressure, lower hemoglobin, and lower reticulocyte levels were associated with occurrence of eGFR < 90. Estimated GFR < 60 increased the risk of mortality.
34111308		Risk factors for CKD stage II onset in a prospective cohort of homozygous sickle cell adults.Prevalence of renal impairment is increasing with aging in sickle cell anemia (SCA) patients, and is responsible for a high morbidity and mortality. However, sickle cell nephropathy's natural course remains mostly unknown. We conducted a prospective observational cohort study aimed to identify risk factors for CKD stage II in a cohort of SCA patients. Baseline clinical and biological parameters were collected. Renal parameters were updated at each visit. Risk factors were analyzed using the Cox model. Five-hundred and thirty-five SCA patients were included with a median follow-up of 5.33 (IQR:2.10-8.13) years. Median age was 22 (IQR:19-30) years old. Glomerular hyperfiltration was detected in 299 (55.9%) patients, microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria in 180 (34%) and 67 (12.7%) patients respectively. During follow up, CKD stage II onset was detected in 39 patients (7.3%). Risk factors for CKD stage II after adjustment on baseline eGFR and age were macroalbuminuria HR: 3.89 [95% CI: 1.61;9.43], diastolic blood pressure (DBP) above 70 mm Hg HR: 2.02 [1.02-3.971], LDH (for 100 IU/L increase) HR: 1.28 [1.12;1.48] and tricuspid regurgitation velocity >2.5 m/sec HR: 2.89 [1.20-6.99]. Multivariate analysis also found age as a strong independent risk factor with HR: (per year increase) 1.13 [1.09;1.16] and a 13.3-fold increase above 30 years (p < 0.001). Our results show a high incidence of CKD stage II with aging, with a strong significant risk increase after 30-years-old, and pinpoint baseline DBP, macroalbuminuria and increased LDH as independent risk factors raising the issue of optimal blood pressure targets for SCA patients.
36932676		Red blood cell lingering modulates hematocrit distribution in the microcirculation.The distribution of red blood cells (RBCs) in the microcirculation determines the oxygen delivery and solute transport to tissues. This process relies on the partitioning of RBCs at successive bifurcations throughout the microvascular network, and it has been known since the last century that RBCs partition disproportionately to the fractional blood flow rate, therefore leading to heterogeneity of the hematocrit (i.e., volume fraction of RBCs in blood) in microvessels. Usually, downstream of a microvascular bifurcation, the vessel branch with a higher fraction of blood flow receives an even higher fraction of RBC flux. However, both temporal and time-average deviations from this phase-separation law have been observed in recent studies. Here, we quantify how the microscopic behavior of RBC lingering (i.e., RBCs temporarily residing near the bifurcation apex with diminished velocity) influences their partitioning, through combined in vivo experiments and in silico simulations. We developed an approach to quantify the cell lingering at highly confined capillary-level bifurcations and demonstrate that it correlates with deviations of the phase-separation process from established empirical predictions by Pries et al. Furthermore, we shed light on how the bifurcation geometry and cell membrane rigidity can affect the lingering behavior of RBCs; e.g., rigid cells tend to linger less than softer ones. Taken together, RBC lingering is an important mechanism that should be considered when studying how abnormal RBC rigidity in diseases such as malaria and sickle-cell disease could hinder the microcirculatory blood flow or how the vascular networks are altered under pathological conditions (e.g., thrombosis, tumors, aneurysm).

Although it is used for the treatment of hematologic malignancies, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and incorporated into many hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) conditioning regimens, few studies have evaluated the pharmacology of alemtuzumab in adult patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). We therefore examined the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of alemtuzumab in adults with SCD who received a matched related donor HSCT to determine if the clearance of alemtuzumab affects transplant outcomes. DESIGN: PK and PD analysis of patient data from a single-center clinical trial. SETTING: Clinical research center. PATIENTS: Twenty-two adult patients with SCD who received one of two nonmyeloablative allogeneic HSCT regimens: alemtuzumab and total body irradiation (Alem-TBI) or pentostatin, cyclophosphamide, alemtuzumab, and total body irradiation (Pento-Cy-Alem-TBI). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Alemtuzumab serum concentrations, absolute lymphocyte counts, T-cell (CD3), and myeloid (CD14/15) chimerism were collected at distinct time points and analyzed. A semi-mechanistic PK population model was built to understand inter-individual differences in pharmacology. Alemtuzumab was detectable up to 28 days post-HSCT. The mean alemtuzumab level 7 days after transplant for patients on Alem-TBI was 818 ng/ml, significantly lower than the mean level of 1502 ng/ml for patients on Pento-Cy-Alem-TBI (p < 0.001), but this difference decreased as time progressed. The clearance of alemtuzumab was linear, and the half-life was longer in the Pento-Cy-Alem-TBI group (average half-life = 61.1 h) compared to the Alem-TBI group (average half-life = 44.1 h) (p < 0.001). The CD3 chimerism at 2 and 4 months after transplant positively correlated with alemtuzumab levels collected on day 14 after transplant (R2  = 0.40 and p = 0.004 at 2 months, R2  = 0.36 and p = 0.005 at 4 months), but this significance was lost by 6 months after HSCT. No correlation was seen between alemtuzumab levels and CD14/15 chimerism. CONCLUSION: Between 2 and 4 months after transplant, higher alemtuzumab levels measured 14 days after transplant correlated with patients having better engraftment, suggesting more lymphodepletion may be needed to reduce graft failure in these two non-myeloablative matched related donor HSCT regimens.

This study aimed to investigate genetic modulators of anemia severity, chronic hemolytic rate, and clinical manifestations in pediatric SCA patients from Angola, where the disease is a severe public health problem. METHODS AND RESULTS: The study was conducted on 200 SCA children living in Luanda or Caxito province. Their clinical phenotype was collected from patients' hospital records. Hematological and biochemical phenotypes were characterized in steady state condition. Twelve polymorphic regions in VCAM1, CD36 and NOS3 genes were genotyped using PCR, RFLP, and Sanger sequencing. CD36 gene promoter variants showed a significant impact on anemia severity. Particularly, the rs1413661_C allele was associated with lower hemoglobin levels, and increased number of hospitalizations and transfusions. This is the first report associating this SNP with SCA phenotypic heterogeneity. Moreover, the rs1041163_C allele in VCAM1 was associated with lower LDH levels; inversely the rs2070744_C allele in NOS3 was related with higher LDH levels and number of hospitalizations, being a risk factor for increased hemolytic rate. CONCLUSION: This study highlights, for the first time in the Angolan population, the importance of the genetic modifiers of vascular cell adhesion and nitric oxide metabolism in SCA pediatric phenotypic variability.

37287128		Enhanced IgG immune response to COVID-19 vaccination in patients with sickle cell disease.Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) are considered to be immunocompromised, yet data on the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in SCD is limited. We investigated anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG titres and overall neutralizing activity in 201 adults with SCD and demographically matched non-SCD controls. Unexpectedly, patients with SCD generate a more robust and durable COVID-19 vaccine IgG response compared to matched controls, though the neutralizing activity remained similar across both cohorts. These findings suggest that patients with SCD achieve a similar antibody response following COVID-19 vaccination compared to the general population, with implications for optimal vaccination strategies for patients with SCD.
37688519	treat|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell	Molecular and environmental contributors to neurological complications in sickle cell disease.Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited hemoglobinopathy in which affected hemoglobin polymerizes under hypoxic conditions resulting in red cell distortion and chronic hemolytic anemia. SCD affects millions of people worldwide, primarily in Sub-Saharan Africa and the Indian subcontinent. Due to vaso-occlusion of sickled red cells within the microvasculature, SCD affects virtually every organ system and causes significant morbidity and early mortality. The neurological complications of SCD are particularly devastating and diverse, ranging from overt stroke to covert cerebral injury, including silent cerebral infarctions and blood vessel tortuosity. However, even individuals without evidence of neuroanatomical changes in brain imaging have evidence of cognitive deficits compared to matched healthy controls likely due to chronic cerebral hypoxemia and neuroinflammation. In this review, we first examined the biological contributors to SCD-related neurological complications and then discussed the equally important socioenvironmental contributors. We then discuss the evidence for neuroprotection from the two primary disease-modifying therapies, chronic monthly blood transfusions and hydroxyurea, and end with several experimental therapies designed to specifically target these complications.
37965881		Dermatologic complications in pediatric patients after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for sickle cell disease.Dermatologic complications are common following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, but dermatologic complications among pediatric patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for the treatment of sickle cell disease have been poorly characterized. In this case series of 17 patients (<21 years old) with sickle cell disease who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, 16 (94.1%) experienced one or more dermatologic complications after transplant, with the most common complications including acute or chronic mucocutaneous graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (34.1% of complications), skin eruptions of unknown origin (15.9% of complications), infections (15.9% of complications), and chemotherapy-related pigmentary changes (11.4% of complications). Patients who developed acute or chronic skin GVHD were significantly older at the time of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. These findings highlight the need to closely monitor for dermatologic complications in pediatric patients who undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for sickle cell disease and underscore the importance of involving dermatology early on when skin complications occur, although further research with a larger multicenter study could help clarify the risk for dermatologic complications and help identify potential ways to mitigate this risk.
34089222		A scoping review of transition interventions for young adults with sickle cell disease.Standardized programming for individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD) transitioning from pediatric to adult-centered care does not currently exist, resulting in high rates of mortality and morbidity. This scoping review examines and evaluates the current literature on SCD transition programs and interventions. Eligible studies described an existing program for individuals with SCD aged 12-29 years preparing to transition. The Evidence Project risk-of-bias tool was used to assess article quality. We identified 30 eligible articles, of which, only two were randomized controlled trials. Many studies have incomplete reports of feasibility information, such as completion rates, patient characteristics, and attrition; all studies were limited to a single institution; and most studies were rated high for risk of bias. Progress has been made in designing and gathering initial evaluation data for SCD transition programs; however, there is a need for higher quality studies, consistent assessment, and better dissemination of programs.
35865842		COVID- 19 and sickle cell disease: autopsy findings of three deaths at the 37 Military Hospital, Accra, Ghana.The main pathological effects of COVID-19 infection have been reported to occur in the lungs, with the most pronounced manifestation being reported as Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) with thromboembolic phenomena. Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is a common genetic disorder present in 2% of newborns in Ghana. The complications of SCD include Vaso-Occlusive Crisis and Acute Chest Syndrome, which primarily manifest in the lungs. The effects of SCD on the progression of COVID-19 have not been extensively and clearly documented in literature. The objective was to describe the clinical and pathological findings in three SCD patients who died of COVID-19 related complications. A complete autopsy was performed on each of the three SCD patients who were presumed to have COVID-19. Lung swabs were subsequently taken and tested for SARS-CoV-2. The differences in histopathological findings of the three cases were highlighted and correlation with clinical findings was also done. Lung histopathological findings for all three cases were consistent with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)/ Diffuse Alveolar Damage (DAD) described for infections with COVID-19 and lung swabs tested for SARS-CoV-2 by real time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (rRT-PCR) were positive. Though SCD has been reported not to adversely affect an individual s chance of worse outcome when infected with COVID-19, our findings suggest otherwise. We suggest that SCD may be an important co-morbidity that needs to be considered in COVID-19 patients and when present needs to be considered as an adverse risk for poor outcomes. Also, post-discharge anti-coagulation and monitoring should be encouraged. More autopsies are required to fully understand the pathogenesis of COVID-19 in SCD patients.
35118643		Neurocognitive risk in sickle cell disease: Utilizing neuropsychology services to manage cognitive symptoms and functional limitations.Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited blood disorder that is associated with developmental delays and neurocognitive deficits. This review details key findings related to neurocognitive outcomes for children and adults with emphasis on the impact of neurological correlates and disease severity. Associations between neurocognition, demographic factors and social determinants of health are also reviewed. Emerging literature has reported on the neurocognitive impact of SCD in children and adolescents in Africa and Europe, including children from immigrant communities. Neurocognitive deficits are linked to poor functional outcomes, including transition from paediatric to adult care, medication adherence and unemployment. Integrating neuropsychology into multidisciplinary care for individuals with SCD can assist with identification and management of neurocognitive concerns, intervention development, individualized care plan development and continued multidisciplinary research.

By triggering the polymerization-sickling-vaso-occlusion cascade, lactate accumulation-associated acidosis in response to high-intensity exercise is believed to be one of the causes of complications. However, our understanding of lactate metabolism in response to high-intensity exercise in SCT carriers is incomplete. Thirty male SCT carriers (n = 15) and healthy subjects (n = 15) with and without alpha-thalassemia performed a 2-min high-intensity exercise. Blood and muscle lactate concentrations were measured at exercise completion. Time courses of blood lactate and glucose concentrations were followed during the subsequent recovery. Additional biochemical analyses were performed on biopsies of the vastus lateralis muscle. SCT was associated with lower blood and muscle lactate concentrations in response to the short high-intensity exercise. Compared to controls, the muscle content among SCT carriers of lactate transporter MCT4 and beta2-adrenergic receptor were higher and lower, respectively. During recovery, the lactate removal ability was higher in SCT carriers. In the present study, no effect of alpha-thalassemia was observed. The lower blood and muscle lactate accumulations in SCT carriers may, to some extent, act as protective mechanisms: (i) against exercise-related acidosis and subsequent sickling, that may explain the relatively rare complications observed in exercising SCT carriers; and (ii) against the deleterious effects of intracellular lactate and associated acidosis on muscle function, that might explain the elevated presence of SCT carriers among the best sprinters.
33875765	associate|@CHEMICAL_Iron|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell	Optimisation of T2 and T2* sequences in MRI for better quantification of iron on transfused dependent sickle cell patients.This work aimed to investigate the effect of different shim techniques, voxel sizes, and repetition time (TR) on using theT2 and T2* sequences to determine their optimum settings to investigate the quantification of iron in transfused dependent sickle cell patients. The effect of each of these parameters was investigated on phantoms of different Gadolinium (Gd) concentrations, on 10 volunteers and 25 patients using a1 5T MRI Philips scanner. No significant difference between the three shim techniques was noticed in either T2 or T2* sequence measurements. Pixel sizes of 1 x 1 and 2 x 2 mm provided optimum results for T2 measurements. At 1 x 1 mm pixel size the T2* measurements experienced less error in measurements than the size of 2.5 x 2.5 mm used in the literature. Even though the slice thickness variation did not provide any changes in T2 measurements, the 12 mm provided optimum T2* measurements. TR variation did not yield significant changes on either T2 or T2* measurements. These results indicate that both T2 and T2* sequences can be further improved by providing more reliable measurements and reducing acquisition time.

35210461		Childhood stroke.Stroke is an important cause of neurological morbidity in children; most survivors have permanent neurological deficits that affect the remainder of their life. Stroke in childhood, the focus of this Primer, is distinguished from perinatal stroke, defined as stroke before 29 days of age, because of its unique pathogenesis reflecting the maternal-fetal unit. Although approximately 15% of strokes in adults are haemorrhagic, half of incident strokes in children are haemorrhagic and half are ischaemic. The causes of childhood stroke are distinct from those in adults. Urgent brain imaging is essential to confirm the stroke diagnosis and guide decisions about hyperacute therapies. Secondary stroke prevention strongly depends on the underlying aetiology. While the past decade has seen substantial advances in paediatric stroke research, the quality of evidence for interventions, such as the rapid reperfusion therapies that have revolutionized arterial ischaemic stroke care in adults, remains low. Substantial time delays in diagnosis and treatment continue to challenge best possible care. Effective primary stroke prevention strategies in children with sickle cell disease represent a major success, yet barriers to implementation persist. The multidisciplinary members of the International Pediatric Stroke Organization are coordinating global efforts to tackle these challenges and improve the outcomes in children with cerebrovascular disease.
36516084		Outcomes following posttransplant viral-specific T-cell therapy in patients with sickle cell disease.Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is increasingly used as a curative approach for sickle cell disease (SCD). With the risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), especially in the HLA-mismatched donors, intense immunosuppression is required leading to an increased risk of viral infection. Post-HSCT, adoptive transfer of virus-specific T cell (VSTs) therapies have not been well-studied in SCD patients. Here, we report the outcomes of patients with SCD at a single-center who received VSTs post-transplant to prevent or treat virus infections. Thirteen patients who received HSCT from HLA-matched (n=9) or mismatched (n=4) donors for SCD were treated with a total of 15 VST products for the treatment or prophylaxis of multiple viruses (cytomegalovirus, ebstein barr virus, adenovirus, BK virus, human herpes virus 6 +/- human parainfluenza virus 3). Of the patients evaluated, 46.2% (n=6)) received VSTs as treatment of virus infection. Eighty percent of patients with active viremia (n=4/5) achieved remission of at least 1 target virus. Seven additional patients (53.8%) received VSTs prophylactically and 6/7 (85.7%) remained virus-free post-infusion. No immediate infusion-related toxicities occurred, and severe de novo acute GVHD occurred in only 2 (15.4%) patients. Given the good safety profile, high-rate of clinical responses and sustained remissions when administered with standard anti-viral treatments, the routine use of VSTs post-HSCT as prophylaxis or treatment may improve the overall safety of transplant for patients with SCD.
36694913		Preschool Pain Management Program for Young Children with Sickle Cell Disease: A Pre-Post Feasibility Study.OBJECTIVE: Vaso-occlusive pain crises in sickle cell disease (SCD) often begin in early childhood. We developed an online pain management intervention to teach caregivers of preschool-aged children with SCD behavioral pain management strategies. The feasibility study goals were to examine response to recruitment, barriers to participation, engagement, acceptability and perceived usefulness of the intervention, and suitability of outcome measures. METHODS: Caregivers of children aged 2.0-5.9 years with access to text messaging and a device to access online videos were recruited from a Southeastern outpatient hematology clinic for a 12-week intervention consisting of pain management videos. Videos taught caregivers behavioral pain management strategies and adaptive responses to pain. Workbook activities helped tailor strategies to their child. Caregivers completed process measures as well as baseline and follow-up measures of pain catastrophizing (Pain Catastrophizing Scale-Parent Report) and responses to their child's pain (Adult Response to Children's Symptoms). RESULTS: Fifty percent (10 of 20) of eligible parents enrolled. Caregivers partially completed (N = 6), completed (N = 3), or did not engage (N = 1) in the intervention. Caregivers who engaged in the program reported implementing the pain management strategies. The intervention was rated as high quality, relevant, and useful. Measures of pain catastrophizing and responses to their child's pain appeared sensitive to change. CONCLUSIONS: The intervention to promote adaptive coping to pain was acceptable and feasible for caregivers though we found barriers to delivering the intervention to parents. Evaluation of a modified version of the program is indicated to assess implementation issues and effectiveness.

Following HSCT, persistent anti-donor isohemagglutinins against donor ABO antigens are considered the immunological cause of PRCA. Patients with post-transplant PRCA are at risk for graft rejection and prolonged red blood cell transfusion dependency. No standard treatment exists. Recently however, the anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody daratumumab has been reported to be an effective treatment for post-transplant PRCA in patients with complete donor chimerism. Here, we describe the first case of PRCA in a patient with mixed lymphoid patient/donor chimerism that was successfully treated with daratumumab. This is also the first report of a transplant recipient with sickle cell disease who was treated with this relatively new approach. Fourteen months post-transplantation and twelve months after treatment with daratumumab, our patient has a normal complete blood count and the anti-donor isohemagglutinins remain undetectable despite mixed lymphoid chimerism. Mixed chimerism is a common manifestation in adult patients with sickle cell disease transplanted with non-myeloablative conditioning and a matched sibling donor. The application of non-myeloablative HSCT for patients with sickle cell disease is steadily increasing. Therefore, the incidence of PRCA in this setting might also increase. As the risk of graft rejection due to PRCA can be especially high in patients with mixed chimerism, clinicians should be aware that daratumumab can be an effective treatment in the setting of mixed chimerism.
34003094		[Newborn screening for sickle cell disease in France].Newborn screening (NBS) for sickle cell disease (SCD) in France has allowed the identification of 9,260 children with SCD since 1989, including 583 in 2019. In mainland France, however, SCD screening is targeted to newborns identified at risk of SCD, i.e born from parents originating from countries with a high SCD prevalence. This screening program, combined to prophylactic measures and a well-organized social and health network in France, has demonstrated considerable efficacy in reducing childhood mortality as well as severe infectious, anemic and neurovascular complications in childhood. SCD NBS has additionally allowed the identification of 180,687 heterozygous (AS) children since 1989. The increasing incidence of SCD (1/1,303 new-borns identified in 2019 versus 1/2,089 in 2009) now pleads for universal NBS and strong advocacy regarding SCD, the most frequent disease identified by NBS in France, and a major public health issue.
37567029		Renal Medullary Carcinoma: A Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Analysis.INTRODUCTION: Renal medullary carcinoma (RMC) is an aggressive and rare renal malignancy that predominantly affects Black patients but is also found in individuals of other ethnicities. To date, only a few hundred cases have been reported in the urologic literature. Due to this extreme rarity, the exact pathophysiology and optimal treatment have yet to be well described. This study aims to determine the predictors of mortality and overall survival outcomes in patients with RMC. METHODS: We utilized the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER) database 18 registries to retrieve demographic and clinical information on patients with RMC between 1996 and 2018. A multivariate analysis was performed to determine predictors of mortality in the study population. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were then created to display the differences in overall survival of Black versus non-Black patients diagnosed with renal medullary carcinoma during the study period. RESULTS: We identified 100 patients diagnosed with renal medullary carcinoma using the SEER Database in the study period. The mean age was 28.0 +- 12.0 (95% confidence interval [CI] 25.7-30.4). Among the patients, 76% were male and 24% were female. Most RMC patients were Black (83%) with only 17% identifying as White. The mean survival in months was 13.8 +- 3.0 (95% CI 7.9-19.7). The majority (70%) of patients in this study presented with distant, metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. Black patients with RMC were less likely to receive surgery and five times more likely to die in comparison to their White counterparts OR = 5.4 (95% CI 1.09-26.9, P = 0.04). Not only did Black patients have a lower survival rate at 12 mo compared to White patients, but they also continued to experience a sharp decline in survival to 10.2% at 24 mo (P < 0.05) and 7.6% at 48 mo (P < 0.05) following diagnosis of renal medullary carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: These data confirm that RMC is a rare disease that disproportionately affects Black patients. The prognosis appears to be substantially worse for Black subjects diagnosed with this cancer than non-Black patients. The worse outcomes seen in Black subjects are of an unclear etiology and are yet to be investigated.
33788385		Monitoring retinal pathology and cerebral injury in sickle cell disease using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography in pediatric patients.PURPOSE: This study aimed to confirm the correlation between sickle cell disease (SCD) genotype and retinal damage identified by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), and examine a potential link between hypoxic ischemic injury in the retina and brain. METHODS: In this prospective, observational case series, 117 patients (56 males) aged 5-20 years with SCD (36 SC, 68 SS, eight Sbeta+ thalassemia, five Sbeta0 thalassemia) underwent ophthalmologic examination including funduscopy and SD-OCT imaging. Comparison of SCD genotypes and association between ocular findings and cerebrovascular disease (CVD) in subjects with SS/Sbeta0 genotype were investigated. RESULTS: Visual acuity ranged from 20/20 to 20/40. On funduscopic exam, 16 of 117 (13.7%) had retinopathy; 69 of 117 (59.0%) showed inner retina thinning on SD-OCT. Patients with SS/Sbeta0 showed a higher frequency of sickle cell retinopathy (SCR) change (68.5% vs. 47.2%), bilateral SCR (49.9% vs. 25.0%), and foveal involvement (15.1% vs. 0) than the SC genotype. While funduscopic findings in our cohort with SS/Sbeta0 genotype showed no correlation with CVD, 20 of 21 patients with CVD had abnormal SD-OCT. Elevated reticulocyte percentage and aspartate aminotransferase are associated with SD-OCT changes and CVD. CONCLUSIONS: SD-OCT was better than funduscopy in detecting retinal changes, higher frequency, and more extensive retinal changes in the more severe SCD genotypes SS and Sbeta0 as compared with SC. The correlation between abnormal SD-OCT and CVD strongly suggests that retinal exam using SD-OCT may aid in detection and monitoring SCD-related CVD. Retinopathy may be another component of the hemolytic subphenotype of SCD.
35135795		Sideroblastic anaemia in a patient with sickle cell disease.Sideroblastic anaemia is a rare condition. We report a unique case of concomitant sideroblastic anaemia in a patient with sickle cell disease with long-standing blood transfusion history. Due to a low prevalence of sideroblastic anaemia, the diagnosis of sideroblastic anaemia is often difficult, especially when coexisting with common types of anaemia, including sickle cell disease. This case highlights the detrimental effects of anchoring bias. Rare causes of refractory anaemia should be considered in patients with haemoglobin disorders as the therapeutic approaches for these conditions are different. High suspicion on the part of the clinician and low threshold for workup of anaemia often aids in the diagnosis of coexisting conditions such as sideroblastic anaemia. Early diagnosis and treatment of sideroblastic anaemia improves patient outcomes and prevents long-term complications.
38029421		Longitudinal analysis of microvascular changes in sickle cell disease using swept-source optical coherence tomography angiography.PURPOSE: To analyze the changes in macular vascular densities (VD) and foveal avascular zone (FAZ) over a 6-year period using swept-source optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) in sickle cell patients compared to unaffected controls. METHODS: Thirty eyes of sickle cell patients and 12 eyes of unaffected controls matched for age and ethnicity were examined at a 6-year interval using the same imaging protocol, including ultra-wide-field angiography, swept-source OCT and 3x3mm OCTA. The macular VD and FAZ were measured on ImageJ software according to previously reported algorithms. RESULTS: In sickle cell eyes, the mean FAZ significantly increased (p <0.01), and the VD decreased in the foveal (within a circle of 1.5 mm in diameter around the foveal center) and temporal areas in both the superficial and deep capillary plexuses (p <0.01). The VD did not change over time in the parafoveal area (annulus between two circles of 1.5 and 3 mm in diameter) and in the superior, inferior, and nasal sectors. No worsening of peripheral retinopathy was observed in the cohort during the follow-up, except for one eye that developed sea-fan. In the control eyes, no microvascular change was observed over time in terms of FAZ size and VD. CONCLUSION: These longitudinal OCTA findings in sickle cell patients showed an enlargement of the FAZ and a decrease in VD in the temporal and perifoveal regions despite the absence of progression of peripheral retinopathy, suggesting a worsening of the macular non-perfusion over time in sickle cell disease.
36100552	associate|@DISEASE_Arterial_Occlusive_Diseases|@GENE_SCN2A	Transfusion support for patients with sickle cell disease.Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion is an essential treatment for many patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), whose RBCs express hemoglobin S (HbS), a mutated form of hemoglobin A (HbA). Transfusion goals include increasing blood oxygen carrying capacity and decreasing the relative amount of HbS to HbA to mitigate vaso-occlusion in small blood vessels. In situations where correction of severe anemia and reduction in HbS may be achieved without removal of RBCs, simple transfusion may be utilized. Partial manual RBC exchange, which removes blood containing HbS by phlebotomy and replaces with donor blood transfusion sequentially allows for larger changes in the ratio of HbS to HbA when compared to simple transfusion. Automated RBC exchange by apheresis is useful in situations where a rapid and drastic HbS reduction is indicated. Vascular access is an important consideration for transfusion. Although peripheral access may be sufficient, central venous catheters and implantable venous access devices may be necessary for adequate access over time. Blood bank considerations include adequate RBC antigen matching to mitigate the risk of RBC alloimmunization, of which patients with SCD are at risk of developing. Transfusion may be utilized in efforts to intervene in the evolution of potentially life-threatening complications of SCD such as acute stroke, severe acute anemia and acute chest syndrome. Transfusion is also useful in several non-acute settings, such as stroke prevention, pregnancy, pre-surgery, and transfusion support for curative therapies. Individualized treatment plans are an essential component of patient care. Continuous evaluation of clinical indications and evolution of guidelines will continue to optimize care for patients with SCD.
34934213		Cerebral aneurysms in pediatrics: a case report and review of the literature.BACKGROUND: Cerebral aneurysms in pediatrics represent < 4% of the total of this condition, and their rupture represents 10-23% mortality. Aneurysms have been associated with infections, head injuries, sickle cell anemia, cardiovascular diseases, autoimmune diseases, immunodeficiencies, and connective tissue diseases. Their clinical presentation includes severe headache, seizures, motor-sensory deficits, and death due to subarachnoid and intraparenchymal hemorrhage. CASE REPORT: We describe the case of a 12-year-old female patient who presented with a sudden intense headache; after 72 hours, generalized tonic-clonic seizures were observed. At the hospital, she was stabilized with antiepileptic drugs and analgesics. A simple head computed tomography scan showed intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the right frontal lobe and subarachnoid hemorrhage. The study was complemented with a cerebral angiotomography, which revealed an aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery. The pediatric neurosurgeon evaluated the case, and management in the pediatric intensive care unit was decided. Two weeks after the stroke, the aneurysm was clipped and excluded. The patient developed adequate clinical evolution and resolution of initial symptoms, resuming her daily activities. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric cerebral aneurysms differ from their adult counterparts, mainly in their etiology and evolution. In addition, pediatric patients have a longer life expectancy. Aneurysm clipping and neurological endovascular therapy have shown similar results.

(2) Methods: Oxygen gradient ektacytometry was performed in 167 adults and children at steady state. In addition, five SS patients had oxygenscan measurements at steady state and during an acute complication requiring hospitalization. (3) Results: Red blood cell (RBC) deformability upon deoxygenation (EImin) and in normoxia (EImax) was increased, and the susceptibility of RBC to sickle upon deoxygenation was decreased in SC patients when compared to untreated SS patients older than 5 years old. SS patients under chronic red blood cell exchange had higher EImin and EImax and lower susceptibility of RBC to sickle upon deoxygenation compared to untreated SS patients, SS patients younger than 5 years old, and hydroxyurea-treated SS and SC patients. The susceptibility of RBC to sickle upon deoxygenation was increased in the five SS patients during acute complication compared to steady state, although the difference between steady state and acute complication was variable from one patient to another. (4) Conclusions: The present study demonstrates that oxygen gradient ektacytometry parameters are affected by sickle cell disease (SCD) genotype and treatment.
33688634		MOLECULAR MEDICINE: Found in Translation.Studies of the major hemoglobin disorders, beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease (SCD), have laid a foundation for molecular medicine. While enormous progress has been made in understanding gene structure and regulation, translating molecular insights to therapy for the many individuals affected with these disorders has been challenging. Advances in three activities have recently converged to bring novel genetic and potentially curative treatments to clinical trials. First, improved lentiviral vectors for gene transfer into hematopoietic stem cells have revived somatic gene therapy for blood disorders. Second, elucidation of regulatory factors and mechanisms that control the normal developmental switch from fetal to adult hemoglobin has provided a route to reactivation of the fetal form for therapy. Third, revolutionary methods of gene engineering permit molecular insights to be leveraged for patients. Here I review how the promise of molecular medicine to bring transformative treatments to the clinical arena is finally being realized.

Chrysin's sickling-suppressive properties in human sickle (SS) erythrocytes in addition to its effect on AA-genotype erythrocytes were evaluated. Sickling was induced (76%) with 2% sodium metabisulphite at 3 h. Chrysin prevented (81.19%) the sickling and reversed same (84.63%) with strong IC50s (0.0257 microM and 0.00275 microM, respectively). The levels of oxygenated haemoglobin in the two groups (before and after induction approaches) were similar but significantly (P < 0.05) higher than that of SS erythrocytes (the 'induced' control), with chrysin-treated AA-genotype showing no effects relative to the untreated. The level of deoxygenated haemoglobin in the 'induced' control group was significantly (P < 0.05) higher than those of the chrysin-treated SS erythrocytes. Normal and chrysin-untreated erythrocytes (AA-untreated) were significantly more resistant to osmotic fragility than the SS-untreated. However, treatment with chrysin significantly reduced the osmotic fragility of the cells relative to the untreated cells. Furthermore, chrysin treatment significantly lowers the high level of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) observed in the sickle erythrocytes, with no effects on AA-genotype erythrocytes. Based on functional chemistry, chrysin treatment alters the functional groups in favour of its antisickling effects judging from the observed bends and shifts. From metabolomics analysis, it was observed that chrysin treatment favors fatty acid alkyl monoesters (FAMEs) production with concomitant shutting down-effects on selenocompound metabolism. Thus, sickling-suppressive effects of chrysin could potentially be associated with modulation of oxygenated and deoxygenated haemoglobin via alteration of human sickle erythrocyte's functional chemistry and metabolic pathways implicated in SCD crisis.

Although malaria has a major contribution to this mortality, to date, the clinical pathology of malaria among children with SCA has been poorly described. We aimed to explore the relationship between SCA and Plasmodium falciparum malaria in further detail by investigating the burden and severity of malaria infections among children recruited with severe anaemia to the TRACT trial of blood transfusion in Africa. METHODS: This study is a post-hoc secondary analysis of the TRACT trial data, conducted after trial completion. TRACT was an open-label, multicentre, factorial, randomised controlled trial enrolling children aged 2 months to 12 years who presented with severe anaemia (haemoglobin <6 0 g/dL) to four hospitals in Africa. This secondary analysis is restricted to Uganda, where the birth prevalence of SCA is approximately 1% and malaria transmission is high. Children were classified as normal (HbAA), heterozygous (HbAS), or homozygous (HbSS; SCA) for the rs334 A T sickle mutation in HBB following batch-genotyping by PCR at the end of the trial. To avoid confounding from SCA-specific medical interventions, we considered children with an existing diagnosis of SCA (known SCA) separately from those diagnosed at the end of the trial (unknown SCA). The outcomes considered in this secondary analysis were measures of P falciparum parasite burden, features of severe malaria, and mortality at day 28 in malaria-positive children. FINDINGS: Between Sept 17, 2014, and May 15, 2017, 3944 children with severe anaemia were enrolled into the TRACT trial. 3483 children from Uganda were considered in this secondary analysis. Overall, 1038 (30%) of 3483 Ugandan children had SCA. 1815 (78%) of 2321 children without SCA (HbAA) tested positive for P falciparum malaria, whereas the prevalence was significantly lower in children with SCA (347 [33%] of 1038; p<0 0001). Concentrations of plasma P falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2), a marker of the total burden of malaria parasites within an individual, were significantly lower in children with either known SCA (median 8 ng/mL; IQR 0-57) or unknown SCA (7 ng/mL; 0-50) than in HbAA children (346 ng/mL; 21-2121; p<0 0001). In contrast to HbAA children, few HbSS children presented with classic features of severe and complicated malaria, but both the frequency and severity of anaemia were higher in HbSS children. We found no evidence for increased mortality at day 28 in those with SCA compared with those without SCA overall (hazard ratios 1 07 [95% CI 0 31-3 76] for known SCA and 0 67 [0 15-2 90] for unknown SCA). INTERPRETATION: The current study suggests that children with SCA are innately protected against classic severe malaria. However, it also shows that even low-level infections can precipitate severe anaemic crises that would likely prove fatal without rapid access to blood transfusion services.

36485131		Organ function indications and potential improvements following curative therapy for sickle cell disease.Curative therapies for sickle cell disease include allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and gene-modified autologous stem cell transplantation. HSCT has been used for 30 years with success measured by engraftment, symptom control, graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) risk, organ toxicity, and immune reconstitution. While human leukocyte antigen-matched sibling donor (MSD) transplants have excellent outcomes, alternate donor transplants (unrelated/haploidentical) are just beginning to overcome GVHD and engraftment hurdles to match MSD. Gene therapy, a newly developed treatment, is undergoing careful evaluation in many trials with varying approaches. The risk/benefit ratio to the patient in relation to outcomes, toxicities, and mortality risk drives eligibility for curative interventions. Consequently, eligibility criteria for MSD transplants can be less stringent, especially in the young. Posttransplant outcome analysis after the "cure" with respect to organ function recovery is essential. While established damage such as stroke is irreversible, transplant can help stabilize (pulmonary function), prevent further deterioration (stroke), improve (neurocognition), and protect unaffected organs. Tracking organ functions postintervention uniformly between clinical trials and for adequate duration is essential to answer safety and efficacy questions related to curative therapies. Age-appropriate application/outcome analyses of such therapies will be the ultimate goal in overcoming this disease.
36637364		Transfusion-transmitted babesiosis in a patient with sickle cell disease undergoing chronic red cell exchange.BACKGROUND: Prior to laboratory-based blood donor screening for Babesia, transfusion-transmitted babesiosis (TTB) was a leading infectious risk to the blood supply in the United States. CASE REPORT: A 30-year-old man with sickle cell disease (SCD) who had been on a chronic automated red cell exchange (RCE) regimen since childhood, presented approximately 2 months after an RCE, with fever, neck pain, and photophobia. Meningitis was excluded, and he was discharged. He presented again 2 days later with persistent fever, chills, headache, fatigue, and loss of appetite. RESULTS: On examination, the patient was febrile but hemodynamically stable. Intra-erythrocytic inclusions were identified on a peripheral blood smear (<0.5%). B. microti IgM and IgG titers were >1:320 (Reference <1:20) >1:1024 (Reference <1:64), respectively. B. microti was confirmed by nucleic acid testing. The patient lived in a Babesia endemic state but had no risk factors for tick-borne acquisition. Of the 65 units he received in the preceding 6 months, 58 had been screened for Babesia. One of the donors of the 7 untested units was B. microti seropositive (titer 1:128; Reference 1: 64). The donor was asymptomatic and resided in a state in which Babesia screening was not required. He reported traveling in the year before his donation. CONCLUSION: Although rare, TTB is still possible despite regional screening, underscoring the need for provider vigilance and education, especially in non-endemic areas. Patients with SCD are particularly vulnerable given their high frequency of transfusion and complex needs requiring blood procurement from states where Babesia screening is not mandatory.
37815822		Altered pain processing and sensitization in sickle cell disease: a scoping review of quantitative sensory testing findings.OBJECTIVES: Over 50% of adults living with sickle cell disease have chronic pain, but the underlying mechanisms of chronic pain in this population remain unclear. Quantitative sensory testing is an important measurement tool for understanding pain and sensory processing. This scoping review summarizes quantitative sensory testing methodologies used in sickle cell studies and the evidence for central sensitization in this population. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL to identify studies using quantitative sensory testing in individuals living with sickle cell disease. Search strategies were based on variations of the terms "sickle cell disease," and "quantitative sensory testing." Eligible studies were observational or experimental studies in human participants living with SCD that reported findings and detailed methodology for at least one quantitative sensory testing modality. RESULTS: Our search yielded a total of 274 records; 27 of which are included in this scoping review. Of the 27 studies, 17 were original studies (with combined total of 516 adult and 298 pediatric participants) and 10 were secondary or subgroup analyses of these prior studies. Significant variation existed in quantitative sensory testing methodologies across studies, including testing locations, type and intensity of stimuli, and interpretation of findings. Of the identified studies, 22% (2/9 studies) reported sensory abnormalities in mechanical sensitivity and thresholds, 22% (2/9 studies) reported abnormal pressure pain thresholds, 46% (6/13 studies) reported sensory abnormalities in thermal pain thresholds and tolerance (cold and warm), and 50% (2/4 studies) reported abnormalities in temporal summation. CONCLUSION: Future studies should use standardized quantitative sensory testing protocols with consistent and operationalized definitions of sensitization to provide clear insight about pain processing and central sensitization in sickle cell disease.
36129238		Outcomes of patients who underwent treatment for anti-HLA donor-specific antibodies before receiving a haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplant.Pediatric and adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients who receive many blood product transfusions, such as individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD), severe aplastic anemia (SAA) or indolent hematologic malignancies, are at high risk for developing donor-specific antibodies (DSA). DSAs with mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) greater than 5000 have been associated with significant graft failure, but lower MFI values between 2000 and 5000 may result in poor graft function after hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT). Desensitization strategies have been developed to reduce the DSA burden in HCT recipients before graft infusion, but the experience with these strategies in the pediatric and AYA populations is not well described in the literature. Here, we describe our experience with successful desensitization by using a combination of treatment strategies in five pediatric and AYA patients, including a novel use of daratumumab in a young adult patient who had refractory DSAs and had suffered serious side effects from conventional desensitization strategies. The presence of elevated DSAs in pediatric and AYA recipients of a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-mismatched haploidentical HCT can be overcome by a multipronged treatment strategy.
34396511	treat|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell	Developmental screening of three-year-old children with sickle cell disease compared to controls.We previously found that neurodevelopmental deficits commonly occurred in three-year-olds with sickle cell disease (SCD), but clinical significance was uncertain because a comparison group was lacking. Our objective in the current study was to prospectively compare neurodevelopment in three-year-old children with SCD to an age-appropriate control group. The Brigance Preschool Screen II is a neurodevelopmental screening examination which can be administered in 15-20 min. SCD patients (Group 1) were compared with community controls of similar age and ethnicity enrolled in daycare/preschool (Group 2). SCD patients who were receiving hydroxycarbamide treatment were also compared (Group 3). Two hundred forty-five three-year-olds were evaluated: Group 1, 111; Group 2, 114; and Group 3, 20. The below cut-off rate on the Brigance test was higher in Group 1 (73%) than in Group 2 (61%; P = 0 04). In multivariate analysis of Group 1 patients, only lower household income and more persons living in the home were independent predictors of this. Patients with SCD and matched controls had high rates of 'failing' the Brigance test. The below cut-off rate in untreated children with SCD was associated with low household income and increased number of persons living in the home.
34001787	treat|@CHEMICAL_Penicillins|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell	Mortality and Causes of Death From Sickle Cell Disease in The Netherlands, 1985-2017.In the Netherlands, between 1985 and 2007 secular changes in the health care of patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) have taken place, such as penicillin prophylaxis, vaccination programs and stroke prevention. We investigated the number and causes of death in a cohort of 298 SCD patients, established in 2007, before introduction of neonatal screening, to determine preventable deaths. All patients were diagnosed with SCD before the age of 18 (median age at diagnosis 5.1 y). Their vital status was determined up to January 2017. After a total follow-up period of 4565 patient years and a median time of follow-up of 15 years for all patients, 230 patients (77%) were still alive, 45 patients (15%) were lost to follow-up and a total of 23 patients (8%) had died. Estimated survival to 18 years was 92% with a global mortality rate of 0.48 deaths/100 patient years. Leading causes of death were infection (35%) followed by neurologic complications (22%) and death in the course of a painful episode (13%). Nine of the 20 known causes of death were preventable. These results strongly suggest the benefit of comprehensive care measures for patients with SCD in the Netherlands to further prevent morbidity and mortality.
35972175		Preoperative Transfusion and Surgical Outcomes for Children with Sickle Cell Disease.BACKGROUND: Current guidelines recommending preoperative transfusion to a hemoglobin level of 9 to 10 g/dL for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) are based on imperfect evidence. The benefit of preoperative transfusion in children specifically is not known. This study aimed to evaluate whether preoperative RBC transfusion is associated with different rates of sickle cell crisis and surgical complications, compared with no preoperative transfusion, among children with SCD undergoing common abdominal operations. STUDY DESIGN: The NSQIP-Pediatrics database (2013 to 2019) was queried. Patients who underwent cholecystectomy, splenectomy, or appendectomy with a preoperative Hct level of less than 30% were included. The primary outcome was 30-day readmission for sickle cell crisis. Secondary outcomes were 30-day surgical complications and hospital length of stay. Propensity score matching methods were used to obtain two statistically similar cohorts of patients comprised of those who were preoperatively transfused and those who were not. RESULTS: Among 357 SCD patients, 200 (56%) received preoperative transfusion. In the matched cohort of 278 patients (139 per group), there was no statistically significant difference in 30-day readmission for sickle cell crisis in the transfused and non-transfused groups (5.8% vs 7.2%, p = 0.80). The rate of 30-day surgical complications did not differ between matched groups (10.8% vs 9.4%, p = 0.84). Subgroups defined by presenting Hct levels of 27.3% or greater or less than 27.3%, American Society of Anesthesiologists classification, wound class, and index operation were not associated with an altered risk of sickle cell crisis or surgical complications after preoperative transfusion compared with no transfusion. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative transfusion for children with SCD undergoing semi-elective abdominal operations was not associated with improved outcomes. Prospective investigation is warranted to strengthen guidelines and minimize unnecessary perioperative transfusions in this population.
37428862		Natural History and Variability in Albuminuria in Pediatric and Murine Sickle Cell Anemia.It is critical to characterize the natural history of albuminuria in patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA); however, these data are currently lacking and impacting evidence based guidelines. We performed a natural history study of the development of pediatric albuminuria.We identified participants with HbSS/HbSB0 thalassemia >= 5 years with albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) measurements performed at a steady-state clinic visit. Participants were characterized with either persistent, intermittent, or never albuminuria. We determined the prevalence of persistent albuminuria, use of ACR>=100 mg/g as a predictor, and variation in ACR measurements. We mirrored this study to determine the variation in albuminuria measurements in the SCA murine model. Among 355 SS/SB0 thalassemia participants with 1728 ACR measurements, we identified 17% with persistent and 13% with intermittent albuminuria. Thirteen percent of participants with persistent albuminuria developed an abnormal ACR prior to 10 years of age. A single ACR measurement >=100 mg/g was associated with a 55.5 times (95% CI:12.3-527) higher odds of having persistent albuminuria. Among participants with ACR >=100 mg/g, we identified significant variability in repeated measures. The median ACR at the initial and next measurements were 175.8 mg/g (IQR:135-242) and 117.3 (IQR:64-292). The human variability in ACR was mirrored by ~20% variability in albuminuria in murine model. This evidence suggests adopting standards for repeating ACR measurements, consider screening for ACR prior to 10 years of age, and using an ACR>100 mg/g as a risk factor for progression. Pediatric and murine renoprotective clinical trials need to consider the high variability in repeated ACR measurements.

GWAS of oxidative hemolysis identified variants in genes encoding antioxidant enzymes, including GLRX, GPX4, G6PD, and SEC14L4 (Golgi-transport protein). Genome-wide significant loci were also tested for association with the severity of steady-state (baseline) in vivo hemolytic anemia in patients with sickle cell disease, with confirmation of identified SNPs in HBA2, G6PD, PIEZO1, AQP1, and SEC14L4.ConclusionsMany of the identified variants, such as those in G6PD, have previously been shown to impair erythrocyte recovery after transfusion, associate with anemia, or cause rare Mendelian human hemolytic diseases. Candidate SNPs in these genes, especially in polygenic combinations, may affect RBC recovery after transfusion and modulate disease severity in hemolytic diseases, such as sickle cell disease and malaria.
36924235		Severity and burden of sickle cell disease in France: a nationwide realworld study.The burden of sickle cell disease (SCD) in France has been difficult to apprehend due to the paucity of reliable nationwide epidemiological data. We aimed to describe the epidemiology of SCD and evaluate its burden and costs. Patients with SCD and most severely affected patients were identified between 2012 and 2018 from the French National Health Data System database (SNDS, Systeme national des donnees de sante). Outcomes of interest included rates of acute and chronic complications, healthcare resource utilisation and associated costs, and were compared in subpopulations of patients before and after Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT), initiating hydroxyurea (HU) or a chronic transfusion program (CTP). Between 2012 and 2018, 22,619 patients with SCD were identified, among which 4,270 patients were defined as most severely affected. Rates of vaso-occlusion (VOC) episodes and acute chest syndrome (ACS) were 86.29 [95CI%: 85.75; 86.83] and 12.90 [95%CI: 12.69; 13.11] per 100 person-years in study population and 166.9 [95%CI: 165.4; 168.4] and 22.71 [95%CI: 22.16; 23.27] per 100 person-years in most severely affected patients. Median (Q1-Q3) annualised total costs were $5,073.63 (1,633.74-14,000.94) and $13,295.67 (5,754.67-26,385.23) in study population and most severely affected patients. Median annualised costs were 10 times lower after treatment intensification for HSCT ($29,011.75 vs $2,465.98, p.
35142256		Preconception care counselling among women with sickle cell anaemia in the south of Iran: a qualitative study based on social marketing model.Pregnancy in women afflicted with sickle cell anaemia has certain adverse effects. The present research aimed to promote the quality of preconception care counselling programs. To do this, Hormozgan Province recruited 25 diseased women and five key informants. To acquire the necessary information, in-depth semi-structured interviews were undertaken. Graneheim's directions for guided content analysis were followed while analysing the data. The results were reported in four categories based on the social marketing constructs. Provision of sickle cell services and preconception care counselling were suggested. The participants preferred to be interviewed in comprehensive healthcare centres in their neighbourhood. The high cost of the lab and medical services was raised as an issue. Face-to-face communication together with other care services was suggested. Providing consultation services in nearby places as in the neighbourhood, including local comprehensive care centres, face-to-face interventions, and mass media, can effectively promote preconception care counselling participation.IMPACT STATEMENTWhat is already known on this subject? The high rate of maternal mortality in women afflicted with sickle cell disease in the south of Iran has attracted growing attention to preconception care counselling in these women. It seems that the social marketing model, due to its audience-based nature, is effective in the acceptance of participatory behaviour in preconception care counselling. To the best of the present researchers' knowledge, there is no similar research in this respect in Iran.What do the results of this study add? Participants' discourse analysis has led to the recognition of the social marketing constituent elements in participation in Preconception care counselling. In their accounts, the participants drew attention to 'Provision of sickle cell services' and 'Provision of Preconception care counseling for sickle cell disease' in their accounts. The participants also mentioned personal, organisational, and sociocultural barriers to the rate of participation. The optimal place was determined for the consultation, and the means of communication were also decided on for implementing the program.What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? Policy-makers and programmers can use the present findings to guide the design and implementation of interventional programs to promote participation in Preconception care counselling for women who have sickle cell disease.
35157404		Multiple Blood Transfusion may contribute to Abnormal Liver and Endocrine Functions in Adults with Sickle Cell Anaemia.BACKGROUND: The study evaluated the effect of multiple blood transfusions on the prevalence of iron load and its effects on organ functions in patients with sickle cell anaemia (SCA). METHODOLOGY: Sixty-seven multiply transfused SCA subjects and 58 non-multiply transfused SCA controls were investigated. Serum ferritin, insulin, growth hormone (GH), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) were measured by the ELISA method while plasma alanine transaminase (ALT) was measured spectrophotometrically. RESULTS: The median serum ferritin level was 364.97 (142.5-579.3) ng/ml and that of ALT was 12.20 (7.4-16.7) IU/l in the subjects and were significantly higher compared with 115.31 (81.3-285.6) ng/ml and 7.74(5.9-9.9) IU/l obtained in the controls (p <0.001 in each case). TSH was significantly lower 1.45 (0.4-2.9) microIU/ml in subjects compared with 2.12 (0.7-3.6) microIU/ml obtained in the controls (p = 0.034). The mean values for T4 in the subjects was 10.19 +- 1.5 microg/dl and was significantly higher compared with that of the controls of 9.57 +- 1.5 microg/dl (p = 0.026). However, there were no significant differences in the mean values of T3, GH and Insulin between the cases and the controls. There was a strong correlation between serum ferritin level and the number of units of blood transfused in the subjects (r = 0.575, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The study found high serum ferritin level in multiply transfused SCA patients and which also correlated with the number of blood units transfused.
35773052		Gene Therapy for Hemoglobinopathies: Beta-Thalassemia, Sickle Cell Disease.beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease (SCD) are the most common monogenic diseases in the world and are potentially curable after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or autologous HSCT after genetic modification. Autologous gene therapy has the potential to offer a universal cure that overcomes many limitations of allogeneic HSCT including the lack of available donors, graft-vs-host disease, and graft rejection. Significant progress in gene therapy for the hemoglobinopathies has been made over the last several decades, now with multiple ongoing clinical trials investigating both gene addition and gene-editing strategies. Available results from a small number of patients, some with relatively short follow-up, are promising, with current efforts focused on continuing to improve the efficacy, durability, and safety of gene therapies for the cure of hemoglobin disorders.
37309787		[Management of acute complications of sickle cell disease].MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE COMPLICATIONS OF SICKLE CELL DISEASE. Acute complications are the most frequent causes of hospitalization and morbidity in patients with sickle cell disease. Vaso-occlusive crisis are responsible of more than 90% of hospitalization, but numerous acute complications can affect multiples organ or function, that may be life-threatening. Thus, a single reason for hospitalization may include many complications such as worsening of an anemia, vascular disease (stroke, thrombosis, priapism), acute chest syndrome, liver or spleen sequestration. Evaluation of acute complications includes the understanding of chronic complications, particularities related to patient's age, the search for a triggering factor and a differential diagnosis. Analgesia and venous access difficulties, post transfusion immunization, medical history of the patient can make the management of acute complication particularly complex.

34396507	associate|@CHEMICAL_Oxygen|@DISEASE_Fabry_Disease	Comparisons of oxygen gradient ektacytometry parameters between sickle cell patients with or without alpha-thalassaemia.The present study tested the impact of alpha-thalassaemia on oxygen gradient ektacytometry in sickle cell anaemia (SCA). Three SCA groups were compared: (i) no alpha-thalassaemia (four alpha-genes, n = 62), (ii) silent alpha-thalassaemia (three alpha-genes, n = 35) and (iii) homozygous alpha-thalassaemia (two alpha-genes, n = 12). Red blood cell (RBC) deformability measured in normoxia was not different between the three groups. The lowest RBC deformability reached at low oxygen partial pressure (pO2 ) was greater and the pO2 at which RBC started to sickle was lower in the two alpha-genes group compared to the other groups. Our present study showed an effect of alpha-thalassaemia on oxygen gradient ektacytometry in SCA.
38158354		Two-Dimensional Ultrasound Assessment of Long-Term Intra-Abdominal Organ Changes in Children with Sickle Cell Anemia during Steady State: A Comparative Study.BACKGROUND: Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is a hereditary blood disorder with global prevalence, including in Nigeria. Despite advancements in SCA care management, understanding the long-term impact on organs during steady state has remained inconclusive. AIM: This study aimed to investigate the long-term changes in intra-abdominal organs of SCA children compared with non-SCA children during steady state using two-dimensional ultrasound assessment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 116 children (58 SCA and 58 controls) were enrolled between June 2021 and July 2022. Clinico-demographic data were collected through an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Two-dimensional ultrasound was used to measure the liver, spleen, kidneys, and inferior vena cava in all subjects. Age-matched controls had AA or AS genotypes. RESULTS: Of the 58 patients with SCA, 65.5% were males with an overall mean age of 8.1   3.4 years, while among the non-SCA cohort (n = 58), 48.3% were males with an overall mean age of 8.7   3.9 years. There was no statistically significant difference in the age and gender distribution between the SCA and non-SCA cohorts (P = 0.390 and P = 0.091, respectively). SCA subjects had a larger mean hepatic size than non-SCA subjects (12.09 cm   2.23 vs. 11.67 cm   1.96; P = 0.276) but smaller mean splenic size (8.01 cm   1.89 vs. 8.19 cm   1.61; P = 0.577) and inferior vena cava diameter (1.16 cm   0.29 vs. 1.25 cm   0.33; P = 0.100). Left kidney length and breadth were significantly greater in SCA patients (8.91   1.16 vs. 8.27   1.30; P = 0.006 and 4.15   0.92 vs. 3.79   0.48; P = 0.008, respectively). CONCLUSION: This study highlights the utility of two-dimensional ultrasound assessment in monitoring intra-abdominal organ changes in SCA children, suggesting its cost-effective benefits in monitoring health outcomes in SCA patients.
34143511		Cardiovascular phenotypes predict clinical outcomes in sickle cell disease: An echocardiography-based cluster analysis.This study sought to link cardiac phenotypes in homozygous Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) patients with clinical profiles and outcomes using cluster analysis. We analyzed data of 379 patients included in the French Etendard Cohort. A cluster analyses was performed based on echocardiographic variables, and the association between clusters, clinical profiles and outcomes was assessed. Three clusters were identified. Cluster 1 (n = 123) patients had the lowest cardiac output, mild left cardiac cavities remodeling, mild diastolic dysfunction, and higher tricuspid regurgitation velocity (TRV). They were predominantly female and displayed the most altered functional limitation. Cluster 2 (n = 102) patients had the highest cardiac output and the most remodeled cardiac cavities. Diastolic function and TRV were similar to cluster 1. These patients had a higher blood pressure and a severe hemolytic anemia. Cluster 3 (n = 154) patients had mild left cardiac cavities remodeling, normal diastolic function and lowest TRV values. They were younger with the highest hemoglobin value. Right heart catheterization was performed in 94 patients. Cluster 1 (n = 33) included the majority of pre-capillary PH whilst cluster 2 (n = 34) included post-capillary PH. No PH was found in cluster 3 (n = 27). After a follow-up of 11.4 +- 2 years, death occurred in 41 patients (11%). Cluster 2 patients had the worst prognosis with a 19% mortality rate versus 12% in cluster 1 and 5% in cluster 3 (p log-rank = 0.003). Cluster analysis of echocardiography variables identified three hemodynamic and clinical phenotypes among SCD patients, each predicting a different prognosis.

34553390		Initial experimental experience of triple-knockout pig red blood cells as potential sources for transfusion in alloimmunized patients with sickle cell disease.BACKGROUND: Blood transfusion remains important in the treatment of patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). However, alloimmunization after blood transfusion is associated with patient morbidity and mortality. Triple-knockout (TKO) pigs (i.e., pigs in which the three known xenoantigens to which humans have anti-pig antibodies have been deleted) may be an alternative source of RBCs for these patients because many humans have no preformed antibodies to TKO pig RBCs (pRBCs). METHODS AND MATERIALS: In an in vitro study, plasma from alloimmunized (n = 12) or non-alloimmunized (n = 12) SCD patients was used to determine IgM/IgG binding to, and CDC of, TKO pRBCs. In an in vivo study, after an estimated 25% of blood volume was withdrawn from two capuchin monkeys, CFSE-labeled TKO pRBCs were transfused. Loss of TKO pRBCs was monitored by flow cytometry, and 7 weeks later, 25% of blood was withdrawn, and CFSE-labeled monkey RBCs were transfused. RESULTS: The in vitro study demonstrated that plasma from neither alloimmunized nor non-alloimmunized SCD patients bound IgM/IgG to, or induced CDC of, TKO pRBCs. In the in vivo study, survival of TKO pRBCs in the two capuchin monkeys was of 5 and 7 days, respectively, whereas after allotransfusion, survival was >28 days. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, (1) in the present limited study, no antibodies were detected that cross-reacted with TKO pRBCs, and (2) TKO pigs may possibly be an alternate source of RBCs in an emergency if no human RBCs are available.

In normal conditions, intracellular and systemic mechanisms contribute to maintaining iron balance. When this complex homeostatic mechanism fails, an iron overload could be present. Detecting an iron overload is not easy. The gold standard remains the liver biopsy, even if it is invasive and dangerous. Identifying iron using noninvasive techniques allowed a better understanding of the rate of iron overload in different organs, with a low risk for the patient. Estimating serum ferritin (mg/L) is the easiest and, consequently, the most employed diagnostic tool for assessing body iron stores, even if it could be a not specific method. The most common hematological causes of iron overload are myelodysplastic syndromes, sickle cell disease, and thalassemia. In all of these conditions, three drugs have been approved for the treatment of iron overload: deferiprone, deferoxamine, and deferasirox. These chelators have been demonstrated to help lower tissue iron levels and prevent iron overload complications, improving event-free survival (EFS). Nowadays, the decision to start chelation and which chelator to choose remains the joint decision of the clinician and patient.

People with SCD experience anemia, severe acute pain episodes, persistent chronic pain, multiorgan damage, and a reduced life span. The pathophysiology of SCD caused by the polymerization of HbS on deoxygenation results in red cell deformability and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). These 2 factors lead to red cell fragility and hemolysis. Reticulocytosis is an independent predictor of disease morbidity and mortality in SCD. We previously established that humans and mice with SCD exhibit abnormal mitochondrial retention in erythrocytes increasing ROS-associated hemolysis. Here, we investigated the hypothesis that mitochondrial retention and increased ROS are a consequence of stress erythropoiesis. Our results show clearly that stress erythropoiesis in phlebotomized, anemic AA mice results in mitochondrial retention and increased ROS in reticulocytes. We observed that elevated mitochondrial retention in reticulocytes also alters oxygen consumption and potentially contributes to increased HbS polymerization and red blood cell hemolysis. Therefore, these events occurring due to stress erythropoiesis contribute significantly to the pathology of SCD and suggest new therapeutic targets.

34276870		Acute soft head syndrome in a sickle cell disease patient.Acute soft head syndrome is an extremely rare complication in children with sickle cell anemia. We present a 16-year old male patient known to have sickle cell anemia who presented to our emergency department with low grade fever, headache, skull pain and swelling. Magnetic Resonance of the brain was done demonstrating subgaleal collections overlying calvarial signal abnormalities. The combination of clinical and radiological findings were indicative of acute soft head syndrome. Acute soft head syndrome is a rare complication in children with sickle cell anemia and the pathophysiology is related to osteonecrosis and bone infarcts of the calvarium as well as secondary reactive sub-galeal collections. Treatment includes conservative management with intravenous fluids and analgesics, in addition, our patient was treated with antibiotics since differentiation clinically and by imaging can be challenging. Acute soft head syndrome should be considered in the differential diagnosis of headache and skull swelling in children with sickle cell anemia.
34986673	treat|@CHEMICAL_calcium_peroxide|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell	Venous cerebral blood flow quantification and cognition in patients with sickle cell anemia.Prior studies have described high venous signal qualitatively using arterial spin labelling (ASL) in patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA), consistent with arteriovenous shunting. We aimed to quantify the effect and explored cross-sectional associations with arterial oxygen content (CaO2), disease-modifying treatments, silent cerebral infarction (SCI), and cognitive performance. 94 patients with SCA and 42 controls underwent cognitive assessment and MRI with single- and multi- inflow time (TI) ASL sequences. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) and bolus arrival time (BAT) were examined across gray and white matter and high-signal regions of the sagittal sinus. Across gray and white matter, increases in CBF and reductions in BAT were observed in association with reduced CaO2 in patients, irrespective of sequence. Across high-signal sagittal sinus regions, CBF was also increased in association with reduced CaO2 using both sequences. However, BAT was increased rather than reduced in patients across these regions, with no association with CaO2. Using the multiTI sequence in patients, increases in CBF across white matter and high-signal sagittal sinus regions were associated with poorer cognitive performance. These novel findings highlight the utility of multiTI ASL in illuminating, and identifying objectively quantifiable and functionally significant markers of, regional hemodynamic stress in patients with SCA.
33654518		[Acceptability of neonatal screening of the sickle cell disease during the pandemic of COVID-19 in Kisangani, Democratic Republic of the Congo].INTRODUCTION: the implementation of neonatal screening to identify infants with sickle cell disease during the COVID-19 pandemic is a major challenge in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The purpose of this study is to determine whether socio-economic factors are associated with acceptability of newborn screening to identify infants with sickle cell disease during the COVID-19 pandemic in Kisangani, DRC. METHODS: we conducted an observational study of mothers sensitized to neonatal screening to detect sickle cell disease in their newborns with hemotypeSCTM (HT401RUO-USA). The study was carried out at the maternity wards in Kisangani from March 21st to June 30th 2020. Collected data were parity, educational level, age, socio-economic level, occupation, awareness and the reason for the denial of screening. RESULTS: out of 55.5% (273/492) of sensitized mothers, 107 (39.19%) accepted and 166 (60.80%) refused neonatal screening to detect sickle cell disease in their newborn. The reasons for refusal were lack of information (67.5%; 95% CI [59.8-74.5]), lack of money due to confinement (66.3%; 95% CI [58.5-73.4]), blood test to develop a vaccine for protection against COVID-19 (63.2%; 95% CI = [55.4-70.6]). Factors associated with the acceptability of screening were age > 35 years (p = 0.0009; ORa = 3.04; 95% CI = 1.57-5.87) and low socio-economic level (p = 0.0016; ORa = 2.29; 95% CI = 1.37-3.85). CONCLUSION: the acceptability of neonatal screening to detect sickle cell disease during COVID-19 is low in Kisangani. The government should identify effective communication channels to promote health care initiatives.

34610933		Time trends, sociodemographic and health factors associated with discharge and length of stay of hospitalised patients with sickle cell disease in Ghana: a retrospective analysis of national routine health database.OBJECTIVE: Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) are prone to multiple episodes resulting in frequent hospital visits. We determined the time trends, sociodemographic and health factors associated with length of stay (LoS) for patients with SCD in Ghana. DESIGN, PARTICIPANTS, SETTING: We retrospectively analysed SCD hospitalisation records of 22 680 patients from a nationwide database of the Ghana Health Service from 2012 to 2017. OUTCOME MEASURES: Factors associated with LoS were estimated using Cox regression, while the cumulative incidence of being discharged alive was estimated with in-hospital death as a competing risk. RESULTS: Patients admitted for SCD over 6 years constituted 22 680 (0.8%) of nearly 3 million admissions. The median age and LoS for the patients were 16 years (IQR=8-24) and 3 days (IQR=2-4), representing 14 202 (62.6%) of the patients discharged alive by the third day. Patients with sickle cell anaemia (6139, 52.6%) with a crisis were more frequent than those without a crisis. Increasing age was associated with shorter LoS when comparing age groups 10-14 years (HR=1.08, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.14) and 25-29 years (HR=1.27, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.37) to patients aged 0-4 years. Patients with comorbidities had a longer LoS compared with those without (HR=0.88, 95% CI 0.86 to 0.90). CONCLUSION: This is the largest study to date documenting factors associated with LoS for patients admitted for SCD. The association of younger age with increased LoS supports recent calls for early SCD screening, especially newborns. The emerging trends and factors accounting for SCD admission require a multisector approach as these patients already experience frequent episodes of pain and hospital visits.

While recent attention has focused on patient HPV vaccine hesitancy and refusal, less is known about provider-level and system-level barriers to vaccinations in pediatric hematology/oncology (PHO) populations. Applying thematic analysis to qualitative interviews with 20 pediatric hematology/oncology physicians and nurse practitioners, we examine their views regarding HPV vaccination, with a focus on access and barriers to providing HPV vaccination in PHO practices. Results demonstrated that despite 90% of interviewees supporting HPV vaccination in their population, the number of pediatric hematology/oncology providers who reported that they counsel about HPV or provide HPV vaccination was 45%, even in stem cell and sickle cell clinics, where other childhood vaccines are commonly provided. Clinicians identified provider-level, clinic-level, and system-level barriers to giving the HPV vaccination, including but not limited to time/flow constraints, lack of resources, and continued education regarding the HPV vaccine. These barriers impede the ability for pediatric hematology/oncology providers to counsel and provide HPV vaccination to this specialized population.

Managing VOE pain can be difficult and complex. Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, has been used to manage VOE pain. This systematic literature review synthesizes research published from 2010 to 2020 on the use of ketamine infusion to decrease VOE pain. The review demonstrates that ketamine, a safe and effective treatment for VOE pain, could be considered more widely. However, the significant variability among published clinical studies with regard to dosing, timing of initiation, duration of infusion, and timing of discontinuation highlights the need for standardized ketamine infusion protocols for the management of VOE pain. We conclude with a brief discussion of key components of a potential standardized protocol supported by the literature reviewed as well as areas for future investigation.
36671952		Advances in Microfluidics for Single Red Blood Cell Analysis.The utilizations of microfluidic chips for single RBC (red blood cell) studies have attracted great interests in recent years to filter, trap, analyze, and release single erythrocytes for various applications. Researchers in this field have highlighted the vast potential in developing micro devices for industrial and academia usages, including lab-on-a-chip and organ-on-a-chip systems. This article critically reviews the current state-of-the-art and recent advances of microfluidics for single RBC analyses, including integrated sensors and microfluidic platforms for microscopic/tomographic/spectroscopic single RBC analyses, trapping arrays (including bifurcating channels), dielectrophoretic and agglutination/aggregation studies, as well as clinical implications covering cancer, sepsis, prenatal, and Sickle Cell diseases. Microfluidics based RBC microarrays, sorting/counting and trapping techniques (including acoustic, dielectrophoretic, hydrodynamic, magnetic, and optical techniques) are also reviewed. Lastly, organs on chips, multi-organ chips, and drug discovery involving single RBC are described. The limitations and drawbacks of each technology are addressed and future prospects are discussed.

36367870	treat|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell	What does it mean to be affiliated with care?: Delphi consensus on the definition of "unaffiliation" and "specialist" in sickle cell disease.Accruing evidence reveals best practices for how to help individuals living with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD); yet, the implementation of these evidence-based practices in healthcare settings is lacking. The Sickle Cell Disease Implementation Consortium (SCDIC) is a national consortium that uses implementation science to identify and address barriers to care in SCD. The SCDIC seeks to understand how and why patients become unaffiliated from care and determine strategies to identify and connect patients to care. A challenge, however, is the lack of agreed-upon definition for what it means to be unaffiliated and what it means to be a "SCD expert provider". In this study, we conducted a Delphi process to obtain expert consensus on what it means to be an "unaffiliated patient" with SCD and to define an "SCD specialist," as no standard definition is available. Twenty-eight SCD experts participated in three rounds of questions. Consensus was defined as 80% or more of respondents agreeing. Experts reached consensus that an individual with SCD who is unaffiliated from care is "someone who has not been seen by a sickle cell specialist in at least a year." A sickle cell specialist was defined as someone with knowledge and experience in SCD. Having "knowledge" means: being knowledgeable of the 2014 NIH Guidelines, "Evidence-Based Management of SCD", trained in hydroxyurea management and transfusions, trained on screening for organ damage in SCD, trained in pain management and on SCD emergencies, and is aware of psychosocial and cognitive issues in SCD. Experiences that are expected of a SCD specialist include experience working with SCD patients, mentored by a SCD specialist, regular attendance at SCD conferences, and obtains continuing medical education on SCD every 2 years." The results have strong implications for future research, practice, and policy related to SCD by helping to lay a foundation for an new area of research (e.g., to identify subpopulations of unaffiliation and targeted interventions) and policies that support reaffiliation and increase accessibility to quality care.
35264367		Enablers and barriers to newborn screening for sickle cell disease in Africa: results from a qualitative study involving programmes in six countries.OBJECTIVES: Given the fundamental role of newborn bloodspot screening (NBS) to enable prompt diagnosis and optimal clinical management of individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD), we sought to systematically assess enablers and barriers to implementation of NBS programmes for SCD in Africa using established qualitative research methods. SETTING: Childbirth centres and NBS laboratories from six countries in East, West and Southern Africa. PARTICIPANTS: Eight programme leaders involved with establishing and operating NBS programmes for SCD in Angola, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, Liberia, Nigeria and Tanzania. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Data obtained through a structured, phased interview approach were analysed using a combination of inductive and deductive codes and used to determine primary themes related to the implementation and sustainability of SCD NBS programmes. RESULTS: Four primary themes emerged from the analysis relating to governance (eg, pragmatic considerations when deploying overcommitted clinical staff to perform NBS), technical (eg, design and execution of operational processes), cultural (eg, variability of knowledge and perceptions of community-based staff) and financial (eg, issues that can arise when external funding may effectively preclude government inputs) aspects. Key learnings included perceived factors that contribute to long-term NBS programme sustainability. CONCLUSIONS: The establishment of enduring NBS programmes is a proven approach to improving the health of populations with SCD. Organising such programmes in Africa is feasible, but initial implementation does not assure sustainability. Our analysis suggests that future programmes should prioritise government partner participation and funding from the earliest stages of programme development.
34486556		Treatment-related Correlates of Growth in Children With Sickle Cell Disease in the DISPLACE Cohort.Reduced growth and delayed maturation have been described in children with sickle cell disease (SCD). This study investigated growth and hemolysis in children with SCD in the DISPLACE (Dissemination and Implementation of Stroke Prevention Looking at the Care Environment) cohort. The database includes 5287 children, of which, 3305 had at least 2 growth measurements over a 5-year period. Body mass index was converted to z-scores (zBMI), and 19.8%, 66.1%, 14.2% of children were classified as underweight, normal, and overweight/obese, respectively. Multivariable analysis of growth was conducted and included variables: age, sex, blood pressure, hemoglobin, reticulocyte count, treatment with chronic red cell transfusion therapy (CRCT), or hydroxyurea therapy. Baseline hemoglobin levels were associated with the lower odds of being underweight (odds ratio [OR]=0.93, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.86-0.99), and higher odds of being overweight/obese (OR: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.17-1.36) compared with normal zBMI. CRCT was associated with being overweight/obese at baseline (OR: 1.85, 95% CI: 1.31-2.60). Overall, results showed that children who were underweight improved regardless of therapy over the 2-year time period. However, children on CRCT are at higher risk for being overweight and should be monitored closely.
37731093	treat|@CHEMICAL_Opiate_Alkaloids|@DISEASE_Pain	A Comparison of the effect of patient-specific vs. weight-based protocols to treat vaso-occlusive episodes (VOE) in the emergency department.BACKGROUND: Vaso-occlusive episodes (VOC) cause debilitating pain and are a common cause of emergency department (ED) visits, for people with sickle cell disease (SCD). Strategies for achieving optimal pain control vary widely despite evidence-based guidelines. We tested existing guidelines and hypothesized a patient-specific protocol (PSP) written by their SCD provider, may be more effective than weight-based (WB) dosing of parenteral opiate medication, in relieving pain. METHODS: Prospective, randomized controlled trial comparing a PSP versus WB protocol for patients presenting with VOC to six EDs. Patients were randomized to a PSP or WB protocol prior to an ED visit. SCD provider wrote their protocol and placed in the electronic health record for future ED visits with a VOC Exclusion criteria included: pre-existing PSP excluding parenteral opioid analgesia or out-patient use of buprenorphine or methadone, or highly suspected for COVID-19. Pain intensity scores, side effects and safety were obtained every 30 minutes for up to 6 hours post-ED bed placement. The primary outcome was change in pain intensity score from placement in an ED space to disposition or six hours. RESULTS: 328 subjects were randomized, 104 participants enrolled (ED visit, target n=230) with complete data for 96 visits. The study was unable to reach the target sample size and stopped early due to the impact of COVID-19. We found no significant differences between groups in the primary outcome; patients randomized to a PSP had a shorter ED length of stay (p=.008); the prevalence of side effects was low in both groups. Subjects in both groups experienced both a clinically meaningful and statistically significant decrease in pain (27 mm on a 0-100 mm scale) CONCLUSIONS: We found a shorter ED length of stay for patients assigned to a PSP. Patients in both groups experienced good pain relief without significant side effects.
37522971	associate|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell|@GENE_HBB	Recent national trends in outcomes and economic disparities among adult sickle cell disease-related admissions.Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited disorder caused secondary to a mutation in the hemoglobin beta subunit. There is sparse information regarding the trends in outcomes of SCD admissions in the past decade where rapid advances have been made in treatment. In this study, we wanted to analyze the trends and outcomes of SCD admissions in the United States from 2011 to 2019 and the influence of socio-economic status. Data were obtained from the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database using the International Classification of Disease (ICD-9) and ICD-10 codes. Trends for primary in-hospital outcomes including mortality, length of stay (LOS), and total hospitalization charges (THC) were assessed. The impact of economic status on these outcomes was also studied. There was an annual percent change (APC) in the number of admissions for SCD of + 2.5% from 2010 to 2015 (95% CI: 1.3-3.8%, p = 0.003). However, there was no significant change in the number of admissions between 2015 and 2019 (95% CI - 1.8-0.7%, p = 0.323). The overall mortality across the years has decreased by about 4% yearly at the population level (p = 0.008, 95% CI 2-8%). However, the inpatient mortality for the high-income group had decreased significantly from 2010 to 2019, whereas there was no difference in the mortality rate for the low-income group across the decade. Despite the advances in the understanding of SCD and its treatment, its benefits have not reached all the people affected. Meaningful progress in healthcare is not achievable unless these economic disparities are addressed. Economic policies to address these inequities are the need of the hour.
36510393		Clinical Delivery and Effectiveness of Music Therapy in Hematology and Oncology: An EMMPIRE Retrospective Study.BACKGROUND: Music therapy (MT) has been shown to improve outcomes for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and patients with hematologic and/or oncologic conditions excluding SCD (HemOnc) in prior randomized trials. While few studies have described the clinical delivery (ie, volume, clinical settings, patient characteristics, referrals, and session characteristics) of MT and examined its real-world effectiveness, no studies have compared responses between hematology/oncology populations. The purpose of this study was to examine the clinical delivery and effectiveness of MT at a freestanding academic cancer center and compare the effectiveness of MT on pain, anxiety, and fatigue between adult patients in the HemOnc and SCD groups. METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of all MT sessions provided at a freestanding academic cancer center between January 2017 and July 2020. The unadjusted single-session effects of MT on pain, anxiety, and fatigue were assessed among patients reporting symptoms >=1 out of 10 on a 0 to 10 scale. Adjustments were made for multiple sessions on the same patient using a mixed model to compare pre-session and change scores between the HemOnc and SCD groups. Patients' comments were analyzed using conventional qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Music therapists provided 4002 sessions to 1152 patients including 1012 in the HemOnc group and 140 in the SCD group. In the combined sample, statistically significant reductions in pain (1.48 units), anxiety (2.58 units), and fatigue (0.84 units) were observed, with changes in pain and anxiety exceeding clinically significant thresholds. After adjustment, the SCD group reported significantly greater pre-session pain (7.22 vs 5.81) and anxiety (6.11 vs 5.17) as well as greater anxiety reduction (2.89 vs 2.23) than the HemOnc group. Patients' comments contained themes including enjoyment, gratitude, and improvements in mood, pain, and anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the delivery and clinical effectiveness of MT for addressing the needs of patients throughout their course of treatment at an academic cancer center and justifies the inclusion of individuals with SCD within integrative oncology services.
37976795		Relative anemia and perioperative stroke in children with moyamoya.OBJECTIVES: Surgical revascularization for moyamoya arteriopathy decreases long-term stroke risk but carries a risk of perioperative ischemic complications. We aimed to evaluate modifiable stroke risk factors in children undergoing surgical revascularization for moyamoya. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this exploratory, single-center, retrospective cohort study, medical records of pediatric patients undergoing surgical revascularization for moyamoya arteriopathy at our center between 2003 and 2021 were reviewed. Candidate modifiable risk factors were analyzed for association with perioperative stroke, defined as ischemic stroke <=7 days after surgery. RESULTS: We analyzed 53 surgeries, consisting of 39 individual patients undergoing indirect surgical revascularization of 74 hemispheres. Perioperative ischemic stroke occurred following five surgeries (9.4%). There were no instances of hemorrhagic stroke. Larger pre-to-postoperative decreases in hemoglobin (OR 3.90, p=0.017), hematocrit (OR 1.69, p=0.012) and blood urea nitrogen (OR 1.83, p=0.010) were associated with increased risk of perioperative ischemic stroke. Weight-adjusted intraoperative blood loss was not associated with risk of perioperative ischemic stroke (OR 0.94, p=0.796). Among children with sickle cell disease, all of whom underwent exchange transfusion within one week prior to surgery, none experienced perioperative stroke. CONCLUSIONS: Decreases in hemoglobin, hematocrit, and blood urea nitrogen between the preoperative and postoperative periods are associated with increased risk of perioperative stroke. These novel findings suggest that dilutional anemia, possibly due to standardly administered hyperhydration, may increase the risk of perioperative stroke in some children with moyamoya. Further work optimizing both mean arterial pressure and oxygen-carrying capacity in these patients, including consideration of alternative blood transfusion thresholds, is necessary.
36883373		Emergency red cell exchange for the management of acute complications in sickle cell disease: Automated versus manual.BACKGROUND: Red blood cell exchange is the cornerstone of the management for acute complications of sickle cell disease. It improves anaemia and improvesperipheral tissue oxygen delivery while at the same time reduces the proportion of circulating sickle erythrocytes. Even though automated red cell exchange is very effective in rapidly lowering the Hb S level, 24-h availability is currently not feasible for most specialist centres including our own. OBJECTIVE: Here, we describe our experience using both automated and manual red cell exchange for the management of acute sickle cell complications. METHODS: Eighty-six such episodes have been recorded between June 2011 and June 2022 comprising of 68 episodes of automated and 18 episodes of manual red cell exchange. RESULTS: The post procedure Hb S/S + C level was 18% after automated and 36% after manual red cell exchange. The platelet count dropped by 41% and 21% after automated and manual red cell exchange respectively. The clinical outcomes including need for organ support, duration of stay in the intensive care unit and overall length of hospitalisation was comparable between the two groups. CONCLUSION: In our experience, manual red cell exchange is a safe and effective alternative to an automated procedure that can be used while specialist centres are building up their capacity to offer automated red cell exchange for all patients requiring the intervention.
36173745	treat|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell	Vital Signs: Use of Recommended Health Care Measures to Prevent Selected Complications of Sickle Cell Anemia in Children and Adolescents - Selected U.S. States, 2019.INTRODUCTION: Sickle cell disease (SCD), a group of inherited blood cell disorders that primarily affects Black or African American persons, is associated with severe complications and a >20-year reduction in life expectancy. In 2014, an expert panel convened by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute issued recommendations to prevent or reduce complications in children and adolescents with the most severe SCD subtypes, known as sickle cell anemia (SCA); recommendations included 1) annual screening of children and adolescents aged 2-16 years with transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound to identify those at risk for stroke and 2) offering hydroxyurea therapy to children and adolescents aged >=9 months to reduce the risk for several life-threatening complications. METHODS: Data from the IBM MarketScan Multi-State Medicaid Database were analyzed. TCD screening and hydroxyurea use were examined for 3,352 children and adolescents with SCA aged 2-16 years and continuously enrolled in Medicaid during 2019. Percentage change during 2014-2019 and variation by health subgroups were assessed. Analyses were stratified by age. RESULTS: During 2014-2019, TCD screening increased 27% among children and adolescents aged 10-16 years; hydroxyurea use increased 27% among children aged 2-9 years and 23% among children and adolescents aged 10-16 years. However, in 2019, only 47% and 38% of children and adolescents aged 2-9 and 10-16 years, respectively, had received TCD screening and 38% and 53% of children and adolescents aged 2-9 years and 10-16 years, respectively, used hydroxyurea. For both prevention strategies, usage was highest among children and adolescents with high levels of health care utilization and evidence of previous complications indicative of severe disease. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH PRACTICE: Despite increases since 2014, TCD screening and hydroxyurea use remain low among children and adolescents with SCA. Health care providers should implement quality care strategies within their clinics and partner with patients, families, and community-based organizations to address barriers to delivering and receiving recommended care.
34289712	associate|@DISEASE_Albuminuria|@GENE_EGF	Novel kidney injury biomarkers in a large cohort of children with sickle cell anemia.Aim: The aim of this study was to compare novel kidney injury biomarkers in sickle cell anemia (SCA) children with and without albuminuria or glomerular hyperfiltration. Materials & methods: A total of 358 Brazilian children with SCA were studied. Fifteen kidney injury biomarkers in urine were measured. Albuminuria was defined as urine albumin/creatinine ratio >100 mg/g. Glomerular hyperfiltration was defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate >=140 ml/min/1.73 m2. Results: After adjustment for age, sex and modifying therapies in use, EGF and collagen IV urinary levels were associated with albuminuria. Renin and clusterin levels were associated with hyperfiltration. Conclusion: Levels of novel kidney injury biomarkers were associated with albuminuria and hyperfiltration in Brazilian children with SCA, suggesting concomitant structural and functional abnormalities.

36064527		Adverse events of red blood cell transfusions in patients with sickle cell disease.Blood transfusion is a common medical intervention for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and disease related complications. While patients with SCD are at risk for all transfusion related adverse events defined by the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) Biovigilance Component Hemovigilance Module Surveillance Protocol, they are uniquely susceptible to certain adverse events. This review discusses risk factors, mitigation strategies, and management recommendations for alloimmunization, hemolytic transfusion reactions, hyperviscosity and transfusion-associated iron overload in the context of SCD.
33971039		Transcranial color-coded duplex sonography reliably identifies intracranial vasculopathy in adult patients with sickle cell disease.In order to prevent stroke, screening for disease-related intracranial vasculopathy using Doppler ultrasound is recommended in sickle-cell disease (SCD) children. How to screen such vasculopathy in adults remains largely unknown. The objective of this study was to assess whether transcranial color-coded duplex sonography (TCCD) is sensitive and specific enough to identify SCD adult patients with vasculopathy, compared with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). Sickle cell disease adults followed in referral centers at high risk of vasculopathy were included in this study. Transcranial color-coded duplex sonography examination and 3-D time-of-flight MRA were performed on the same day. On MRA, vasculopathy was defined by the presence of at least one >=50% arterial stenosis. On TCCD, vasculopathy was defined by a time-averaged mean of the maximum velocity (TAMx) stenotic/prestenotic ratio >= 3, an occlusion, or a Moyamoya pattern. Vasculopathy was also considered as present when TAMx ratio could not be calculated because of the presence of severe cervical lesions. Among 80 included patients, quality of MRA was insufficient in three patients. Among the 38 patients with vasculopathy on MRA, 37 had a vasculopathy according to TCCD criteria: TAMx ratio >= 3 or intracranial occlusion in 33 patients and cervical lesion in four patients. A Moyamoya pattern was identified with TCCD in all 17 patients with Moyamoya on MRA. Sensitivity and specificity of TCCD to identify patients with >=50% vasculopathy on MRA were (n = 37/38) 97% and (n = 28/34) 82%, respectively. Positive and negative predictive values were (n = 37/43) 86% and (n = 28/29) 97%, respectively. Note, TCCD may be used to identify SCD adult patients with vasculopathy.
33829933		The Changing Trends in Prenatal Diagnosis of Hemoglobinopathies in India: The Quest of a Single Center to Reduce the Burden of Disease over Three Decades.The beta-thalassemias and sickle cell disorders pose a considerable health burden in India. Of the more than 10,000 annual births of children with a severe hemoglobinopathy, only around 10.0% are managed optimally. Thus, genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis (PND) is a valid option for a large and diverse country. Our center was one of the first to initiate PND and we present our experience over 30 years to evaluate the impact of awareness in changing the trends of PND of hemoglobinopathies. Both second and first-trimester diagnoses were undertaken by fetoscopy/cordocentesis and globin biosynthesis/high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of fetal blood and chorionic villus sampling (CVS) and DNA analysis. Over 30 years, 3478 couples (first trimester: 2475; second trimester: 1003) from all over India were offered PND. The number of couples coming in the first trimester increased significantly over each decade and couples coming prospectively increased from 2.5 to 18.4%. A cost-effective stepwise approach was used for molecular analysis. Eight hundred and one fetuses (23.0%) were affected and all except three couples opted for termination of these pregnancies. Genetic counseling and PND is the only way to reduce the burden of disease. With awareness, there was a shift from second trimester to first trimester PND over each decade, with an increasing number of couples coming during the first pregnancy. There are only 15 to 20 centers in India offering PND. We have compared our study with other reports on PND from different regions in India.
36322607		Multimodal phenotyping and correlates of pain following hematopoietic cell transplant in children with sickle cell disease.INTRODUCTION: There is limited understanding of pain, patient-reported outcomes (PROs) of health-related quality of life (HRQoL), psychological factors, and experimental pain sensitivity before and following hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) in children with sickle cell disease (SCD). METHODS: Individuals aged 8 years and older, English speaking, and scheduled for a HCT were invited to participate in an observational study where they completed assessments of pain, PROs, psychological factors, and qualitative interviews before and around 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years post-HCT. An optional substudy of experimental pain sensitivity before and around 6 month, 1 year, and 2 years post-HCT was also offered. RESULTS: Data from eight participants (median age 13.5 years, 25% female) with sickle cell anemia (SCA) or similarly severe genotype, and successful donor-derived erythropoiesis post-HCT are reported. We found that collection of pain, PROs, psychological factors, and qualitative data were feasible in the context of HCT. We found moderate to large differences in pain and some PROs between baseline to 1 year and baseline to 2 year post-HCT based on effect sizes, but only some differences were statistically significant. We found moderate to large differences in pressure pain threshold and moderate differences in cold pain threshold between baseline to 1 year and baseline to 2 year post-HCT based on effect sizes, but these differences were not statistically significant. Qualitative data indicated an improvement in pain and HRQoL post-HCT. CONCLUSION: This study provides a framework for the conduct of multimodal pain assessments before and after HCT, which is feasible but faced with unique barriers.
35193898		Cross-sectional prospective feasibility study of newborn screening for sickle cell anaemia and congenital hypothyroidism in Guyana.INTRODUCTION: Newborn screening (NBS) is a test done shortly after birth to detect conditions that cause severe health problems if not treated early. An estimated 71% of babies worldwide are born in jurisdictions that do not have an established NBS programme. Guyana currently has no NBS programme and has established a partnership with Newborn Screening Ontario (NSO) to initiate screening. OBJECTIVES: To assess the feasibility of implementing a NBS programme in Guyana for congenital hypothyroidism (CH) and haemoglobinopathies (HBG) and to report on screen positive rates and prevalence (Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE)) for CH and HBG. METHODS: Term, healthy Guyanese infants were evaluated (with consent) using heel prick dried blood spots (DBS) shortly after birth (closer to 24 hours of life). DBS samples were analysed at NSO. Screening test for CH was done using a human thyroid-stimulating hormone (hTSH) assay. Mean hTSH levels between the Guyanese sample and the Ontarian population were compared using Student's t-test with an alpha of 0.05. Screening test for HBG was performed with a cation-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: The pilot was conducted from 6 June 2016 to 22 September 2017. Georgetown Public Hospital Corporation recruited 2294 mothers/infants. Screen positive rate for CH in our sample was 0.0% (0/2038 infants). Mean TSH levels in Guyanese samples (1.7 microU/mL blood) was noticed to be significantly different than in the Ontarian population (4.3 microU/mL blood) (p<0.05). Screen positive rate for sickle cell anaemia (SCA) in our sample was 0.3% (7/2039 patients), and the carrier rate was 8.4% (172/2039 patients). Using the HWE, the SCA frequency (S allele frequency)2 is 0.0492=0.002 CONCLUSION: NBS for CH and SCA in Guyana could be beneficial. Future work should focus on conducting larger pilots which could be used to inform diagnosis and treatment guidelines for Guyanese people.
36853587	treat|@CHEMICAL_Penicillins|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell	Management of Older Adults with Sickle Cell Disease: Considerations for Current and Emerging Therapies.People with sickle cell disease (SCD) are living longer than ever before, with the median survival increasing from age 14 years in 1973, beyond age 40 years in the 1990s, and as high as 61 years in recent cohorts from academic centers. Improvements in survival have been attributed to initiatives, such as newborn screening, penicillin prophylaxis, vaccination against encapsulated organisms, better detection and treatment of splenic sequestration, and improved transfusion support. There are an estimated 100,000 people living with SCD in the United States and millions of people with SCD globally. Given that the number of older adults with SCD will likely continue to increase as survival improves, better evidence on how to manage this population is needed. When managing older adults with SCD (defined herein as age >= 40 years), healthcare providers should consider the potential pitfalls of extrapolating evidence from existing studies on current and emerging therapies that have typically been conducted with participants at mean ages far below 40 years. Older adults with SCD have historically had little to no representation in clinical trials; therefore, more guidance is needed on how to use current and emerging therapies in this population. This article summarizes the available evidence for managing older adults with SCD and discusses potential challenges to using approved and emerging drugs in this population.
34402052		Longitudinal study of glomerular hyperfiltration and normalization of estimated glomerular filtration in adults with sickle cell disease.Glomerular hyperfiltration is common in sickle cell disease (SCD) and precedes proteinuria and declining kidney function. We evaluated hyperfiltration in SCD patients and its "normalization." Routine visit data were collected retrospectively from adult SCD patients in a single centre from 2004 to 2013. Baseline was defined as first available serum creatinine and hyperfiltration as estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR) >130 ml/min/1 73 m2 for women and >140 ml/min/1 73 m2 for men. Normalization of hyperfiltration was eGFR reduction to 90-130 ml/min/1 73 m2 for women or 90-140 ml/min/1 73 m2 for men. Among 292 patients, median age was 27 years [interquartile range (IQR):20 0-38 0], and 56 8% had baseline hyperfiltration. Baseline hyperfiltration was inversely associated with age [odds ratio (OR):0 86, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0 82-0 90; P < 0 0001], male sex (OR:0 16, 95% CI: 0 07-0 41; P = 0 0001), haemoglobin (OR:0 76, 95% CI 0 61-0 94; P = 0 01), weight (OR:0 96, 95% CI: 0 93-0 99; P = 0 004), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker (ACE-I/ARB) use (OR:0 08, 95% CI: 0 01-0 75; P = 0 03), and positively with hydroxycarbamide use (OR:2 99, 95% CI: 1 18-7 56; P = 0 02). Of 89 hyperfiltration patients without baseline proteinuria, 10 (11 2%) developed new-onset proteinuria [median 1 05 years (IQR:0 63-2 09)]. Normalization of hyperfiltration was less likely with higher baseline eGFR [hazard ratio (HR):0 90, 95% CI: 0 86-0 95; P < 0 0001] and more likely in males (HR:6 35, 95% CI:2 71-14 86, <0 0001). Hyperfiltration is common in adult SCD patients, particularly when younger. Decline to normal values is more likely in males, possibly representing kidney function loss rather than improvement in hyperfiltration.
37979134		How We Treat Sickle Cell Disease in Pregnancy.50 years ago, people with sickle cell disease (SCD) were discouraged from becoming pregnant, but now most should be supported if they choose to pursue a pregnancy. They and their providers, however, should be aware of the physiological changes of pregnancy that aggravate SCD and pregnancy's unique maternal and fetal challenges. Any maternal endothelial damage from a poorly perfused placenta has the potential for being superimposed on the endothelial damage of SCD. The immunological and mechanical changes of pregnancy contribute to an increased susceptibility to certain infections. Activation of the complement system and increased neutrophils may contribute to the increase in vaso-occlusive crises during pregnancy. There is an increased demand for red cell mass that is often not achievable without transfusion. Cardiac output increases by 45%. The anatomic and physiologic changes of pregnancy increase the risk of kidney injury. Pregnancy is a hypercoagulable state which confers an increased risk of thrombosis. Maternal problems can arise from chronic underlying organ dysfunction such as renal disease or pulmonary hypertension, from acute complications of SCD such as acute anemia, vaso-occlusive crises and acute chest syndrome, and/or from pregnancy-related complications such as preeclampsia, sepsis, severe anemia, thromboembolism and need for cesarean delivery. Fetal problems include alloimmunization, opioid exposure, fetal growth restriction, preterm delivery, and stillbirth. Prior to and during pregnancy, in addition to the assessment and care that every pregnant patient should receive, patients with SCD should be evaluated and treated by a multidisciplinary team with respect to their unique maternal and fetal issues.

37057741	treat|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell	Cerebral revascularization surgery reduces cerebrovascular events in children with sickle cell disease and moyamoya syndrome: Results of the stroke in sickle cell revascularization surgery retrospective study.BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest that cerebral revascularization surgery may be a safe and effective therapy to reduce stroke risk in patients with sickle cell disease and moyamoya syndrome (SCD-MMS). METHODS: We performed a multicenter, retrospective study of children with SCD-MMS treated with conservative management alone (conservative group)-chronic blood transfusion and/or hydroxyurea-versus conservative management plus surgical revascularization (surgery group). We monitored cerebrovascular event (CVE) rates-a composite of strokes and transient ischemic attacks. Multivariable logistic regression was used to compare CVE occurrence and multivariable Poisson regression was used to compare incidence rates between groups. Covariates in multivariable models included age at treatment start, age at moyamoya diagnosis, antiplatelet use, CVE history, and the risk period length. RESULTS: We identified 141 patients with SCD-MMS, 78 (55.3%) in the surgery group and 63 (44.7%) in the conservative group. Compared with the conservative group, preoperatively the surgery group had a younger age at moyamoya diagnosis, worse baseline modified Rankin scale scores, and increased prevalence of CVEs. Despite more severe pretreatment disease, the surgery group had reduced odds of new CVEs after surgery (odds ratio = 0.27, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.08-0.94, p = .040). Furthermore, comparing surgery group patients during presurgical versus postsurgical periods, CVEs odds were significantly reduced after surgery (odds ratio = 0.22, 95% CI = 0.08-0.58, p = .002). CONCLUSIONS: When added to conservative management, cerebral revascularization surgery appears to reduce the risk of CVEs in patients with SCD-MMS. A prospective study will be needed to validate these findings.
35907865		ADaPTS "(AD)olescents (P)ath through (T)ransplant (S)ickle cell disease".BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease is an inherited chronic hematological disorder with an average lifespan of fifty years. The human cost of sickle cell disease includes missed school days, occupational opportunities, social isolation, stigmatization, and psychological sequelae. Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is the only curative therapy available but comes with potential morbidity and mortality. Our study explores how quality of life (QoL) is affected from the perspective of an adolescent who has undergone a nonmyeloablative matched sibling donor HCT. METHODS: We employed multiple case study methodology with purposeful sampling by selecting information-rich cases. DATA SOURCES: 1) QoL inventories 2) patient interviews 3) parent interview 4) vital support interview 5) medical record analysis. DATA ANALYSIS: Intra-case analysis by assembling evidence within a single case and then analyzing the differences within cases to create a rich case description. Next, a time series analysis was completed to track changes in patients' QoL. We used multiple sources of data to compose a timeline and changes across time. Then, we employed pattern matching as an analytical technique allowing for examination of patterns across cases. Finally, we used cross case synthesis to review results of each case. RESULTS: Quality of life was reported across the physical, social and psychological domains for 5 participants. All had sickle cell HgSS genotype, 80% were male and 80% were born outside of Canada. Physical domain: pre-transplant, 100% of patients experienced pain, and the majority suffered from fatigue, insomnia, and fevers resulting in hospitalizations. Afterwards, participants reported improved physical wellbeing. Social domain: pre-transplant, QoL was poor characterized by stigma, social isolation, and parental absenteeism. Post-HSCT adolescents gained social acceptance in areas that had stigmatized and excluded them. They were able to participate freely in activities with peers and their social life vastly improved. Psychological pre-transplant life experiences were overshadowed by psychological stress. The majority commented that their future was bleak and may lead to premature death. Afterwards adolescents described a crisis free life with positive psychological outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents with sickle cell disease who undertook HCT demonstrated improved QoL one year post transplant with regard to physical, social and psychological well-being.
34779267		Altered Dynamic Brain Connectivity in Individuals With Sickle Cell Disease and Chronic Pain Secondary to Hip Osteonecrosis.Individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD) exhibit changes in static brain connectivity in rest. However, little known as chronic pain associated with hip osteonecrosis affects dynamic brain connectivity during rest and the motor imagery task. The aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics of the dynamic functional brain connectivity of individuals with SCD and chronic pain secondary to hip osteonecrosis. This is a cross-sectional study comparing the dynamic brain connectivity of healthy individuals (n = 18) with the dynamic brain connectivity of individuals with SCD and chronic pain (n = 22). Individuals with SCD and chronic pain were stratified into high- or low-intensity pain groups based on pain intensity at the time of assessment. Dynamic brain connectivity was assessed through electroencephalography in 3 stages, resting state with eyes closed, and during hip (painful for the SCD individuals) and hand (control, nonpainful) motor imagery. Average weight of the edges and full synchronization time (FST)-time required for 95% of the possible edges to appear over time during a given task-were evaluated. Regarding the average weight of the edges, individuals with SCD and high-intensity pain presented higher edge weight during hip motor imagery. The average weight of the edges correlated positively with pain intensity and depression symptoms. Individuals with SCD and chronic pain complete the cerebral network at rest more quickly (lower FST). Individuals with SCD and chronic pain/hip osteonecrosis have impaired dynamic brain network with shorter FST in rest network and more pronounced diffuse connectivity in individuals with high-intensity pain. The dynamic brain network evaluated by time-varying graphs and motif synchronization was able to identify differences between groups.

We found that, in the same patient, higher plerixafor dosing was associated with higher fold increases in PB CD34+ count, but not necessarily higher absolute CD34+ counts. Variation in pre-apheresis absolute CD34+ counts was related to intra-individual variation in baseline PB CD34+ counts and inter-individual variation in responsiveness to plerixafor. Overall, our results support further studies of continued dose escalation of plerixafor for autologous HPC collection in SCD.
37470933		Pediatric Moyamoya Revascularization Perioperative Care: A Modified Delphi Study.BACKGROUND: Surgical revascularization decreases the long-term risk of stroke in children with moyamoya arteriopathy but can be associated with an increased risk of stroke during the perioperative period. Evidence-based approaches to optimize perioperative management are limited and practice varies widely. Using a modified Delphi process, we sought to establish expert consensus on key components of the perioperative care of children with moyamoya undergoing indirect revascularization surgery and identify areas of equipoise to define future research priorities. METHODS: Thirty neurologists, neurosurgeons, and intensivists practicing in North America with expertise in the management of pediatric moyamoya were invited to participate in a three-round, modified Delphi process consisting of a 138-item practice patterns survey, anonymous electronic evaluation of 88 consensus statements on a 5-point Likert scale, and a virtual group meeting during which statements were discussed, revised, and reassessed. Consensus was defined as >= 80% agreement or disagreement. RESULTS: Thirty-nine statements regarding perioperative pediatric moyamoya care for indirect revascularization surgery reached consensus. Salient areas of consensus included the following: (1) children at a high risk for stroke and those with sickle cell disease should be preadmitted prior to indirect revascularization; (2) intravenous isotonic fluids should be administered in all patients for at least 4 h before and 24 h after surgery; (3) aspirin should not be discontinued in the immediate preoperative and postoperative periods; (4) arterial lines for blood pressure monitoring should be continued for at least 24 h after surgery and until active interventions to achieve blood pressure goals are not needed; (5) postoperative care should include hourly vital signs for at least 24 h, hourly neurologic assessments for at least 12 h, adequate pain control, maintaining normoxia and normothermia, and avoiding hypotension; and (6) intravenous fluid bolus administration should be considered the first-line intervention for new focal neurologic deficits following indirect revascularization surgery. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of data supporting specific care practices before and after indirect revascularization surgery in children with moyamoya, this Delphi process defined areas of consensus among neurosurgeons, neurologists, and intensivists with moyamoya expertise. Research priorities identified include determining the role of continuous electroencephalography in postoperative moyamoya care, optimal perioperative blood pressure and hemoglobin targets, and the role of supplemental oxygen for treatment of suspected postoperative ischemia.
35234095	treat|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Pain ;treat|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Chronic_Pain ;treat|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell	Higher hydroxyurea adherence among young adults with sickle cell disease compared to children and adolescents.BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) results in severe complications, such as anaemia and pain episodes. Hydroxyurea (HU) is efficacious in SCD, yet adherence remains low. OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationship of HU adherence to health care utilization and patients' characteristics. METHODS: This is a 5-year retrospective chart review. Patients' demographics and medical history were collected from the electronic medical record (EMR). HU adherence was evaluated using foetal haemoglobin "HbF%", mean corpuscular volume "MCV", and absolute neutrophil count "ANC". Age groups included children (<12 years), adolescents (12-17 years), and young adults (>=18 years). RESULTS: A total of 113 SCD patients on HU were included (median age 14 years, IQR 10-20; 50% female; 88% HbSS). Young adults had significantly higher HU adherence compared to adolescents and children, including higher median HbF% (24.2 vs. 12.4 vs. 8.6, p = .003), MCV (fl) (106.4 vs. 96.2 vs. 95.4, p = .01) and lower ANC (103/ml) (3.25 vs. 4.9 vs. 4.2, p = .01), respectively. Patients with chronic pain had lower HU adherence (HbF% 15.3 vs. 10.7, p = .04; ANC 3.6 vs. 6.3, p = .002; MCV 102.3 vs. 93.1, p = .1). Patients with higher HbF or MCV and lower ANC had significantly less frequent emergency room visits (rs=-0.26, p = .01; rs=-0.23, p = .01; rs=0.24, p = .01) and hospitalizations (rs=-0.27, p = .01; rs=-0.31, p = .01; rs=0.21, p = .02) as well as shorter length of stays (rs=-0.27, p = .0045; rs=-.34, p = 0.004; rs=0.23, p = .02), respectively. Similar trends in HU adherence and health care utilization were seen in subgroup analysis of only HbSS patients. There was no significant association of HU adherence to patients' sex, socio-economic status, distance from hospital, and HU duration. CONCLUSIONS: Young adults with SCD had significantly higher HU adherence compared to children and adolescents. Patients with lower HU adherence and/or chronic pain had increased health care utilization. Future studies examining barriers to adherence and evaluating interventions to optimize HU adherence in SCD are warranted.KEY MESSAGESYoung adults with SCD had significantly higher HU adherence, as reflected in their laboratory markers, compared to children and adolescents.Patients with higher HU adherence and/or those without chronic pain had lower or less frequent health care utilization.No significant association of HU adherence to patients' sex, socio-economic status and distance from hospital.

37820110		Implementation of Hospital-Based Sickle Cell Newborn Screening and Follow-Up Programs in Haiti.One in 120 children are born with sickle cell disease (SCD) in Haiti. However, healthcare challenges include isolated newborn screening (NBS) activities and lack of transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) to assess stroke risk. The implementation activities of the "Comparative Study of Children in Haiti and Miami with Sickle Cell Disease (CSHSCD) involved both NBS and TCD implementations in four Haitian clinical sites. We hypothesized that hospital-based SCD NBS and follow-up programs would be feasible in Haiti. Traditional NBS laboratory method with dried blood samples was performed at two Port-au-Prince sites, and the traditional method plus point-of-care (POC) testing was utilized at the two north sites. The rate of clinical follow-up for newborns with SCD as outcome for the NBS intervention was compared to the NBS method. The NBS programs identified SCD in 0.77% of 8,224 newborns over a 24-month period. In the rural hospital assigned to the combination screening, 56% of newborns identified with POC returned for follow-up compared to 0% when POC was not available (p=0.044). Positive newborns and children <6 years of age with SCD at the clinical sites were eligible for study follow-up. Accrual was successful: 165 participants (mean age 42 months, 53% males, 93% SS) were recruited and received oral penicillin. TCD screening was hampered by poor internet and trained staff leaving Haiti, with only one active site conducting screening. Despite challenges, the implementation of NBS and sickle cell programs in Haiti is feasible. We are in the process of understanding how to mitigate implementation limitations.
34270376		Gaps in knowledge about the vaccine coverage of immunocompromised children: a scoping review.Immunocompromised children are at increased risk of severe illness from vaccine-preventable infections. However, inadequate vaccine coverage remains a concern. This scoping review sought to determine the current state of knowledge regarding vaccine coverage of immunocompromised children. Bibliographic databases were searched for primary research from any year. Data were analyzed quantitatively and narratively. Ninety-seven studies met inclusion criteria. The most commonly studied vaccines were pneumococcal (n = 46), influenza (n = 44), diphtheria/tetanus/pertussis/poliomyelitis/Haemophilus influenzae type B/hepatitis B-containing (n = 36), and measles- and/or mumps- and/or rubella-containing (n = 29). Immunocompromising conditions studied included cancer/stem cell transplants (n = 24), solid organ transplants (n = 23), sickle cell disease (n = 21), immunosuppressive therapy (n = 14), human immunodeficiency virus (n = 12), splenectomy (n = 4), and primary immunodeficiency (n = 2). As more children are treated with immunosuppressive therapies, it is critical to identify whether they are being appropriately vaccinated for age and condition. We identified gaps in the current state of knowledge for specific vaccine types in specific immunocompromised populations.
36147559		Use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist trigger in fertility preservation for patients with inherited genetic disorders.In patients with varying hematologic disorders (thalassemia, sickle cell anemia, aplastic anemia, etc.), inherited bone marrow failure syndromes, and immune deficiencies due to a single gene disorder, the advent of stem cell transplantation (SCT) as a treatment option has allowed for significant disease improvement, and possibly cure. This specific treatment option often requires exposure to chemotherapeutic agents and sometimes whole body radiation; therefore, primary ovarian insufficiency is often sequelae of the therapy. The optimization of fertility preservation protocols within this patient population is of extreme importance. This review aims to detail the use of GnRH agonist use within this patient population, within the context of fertility preservation cycles.

The most widely available curative approach remains allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). HLA-haploidentical (haplo) HSCT expands the donor pool considerably and is a practical alternative for these patients, but traditionally with an increased risk of allograft rejection. Biomarkers in patient plasma could potentially help predict HSCT outcome and allow treatment at an early stage to reverse or prevent graft rejection. Reliable, noninvasive methods to predict engraftment or rejection early after HSCT are needed. We sought to detect variations in the plasma proteomes of patients who engrafted compared with those who rejected their grafts. We used a mass spectrometry-based proteomics approach to identify candidate biomarkers associated with engraftment and rejection by comparing plasma samples obtained from 9 engrafted patients and 10 patients who experienced graft rejection. A total of 1378 proteins were identified, 45 of which were differentially expressed in the engrafted group compared with the rejected group. Based on bioinformatics analysis results, information from the literature, and immunoassay availability, 7 proteins-thrombospondin-1 (Tsp-1), platelet factor 4 (Pf-4), talin-1, moesin, cell division control protein 42 homolog (CDC42), galectin-1 (Gal-1), and CD9-were selected for further analysis. We compared these protein concentrations among 35 plasma samples (engrafted, n = 9; rejected, n = 10; healthy volunteers, n = 8; nontransplanted SCD, n = 8). ELISA analysis confirmed the significant up-regulation of Tsp-1, Pf-4, and Gal-1 in plasma samples from engrafted patients compared with rejected patients, healthy African American volunteers, and the nontransplanted SCD group (P < .01). By receiver operating characteristic analysis, these 3 proteins distinguished engrafted patients from the other groups (area under the curve, >0.8; P < .05). We then evaluated the concentration of these 3 proteins in samples collected pre-HSCT and at days +30, +60, +100, and +180 post-HSCT. The results demonstrate that Tsp-1 and Pf-4 stratified engrafted patients as early as day 60 post-HSCT (P < .01), and that Gal-1 was significantly higher in engrafted patients as early as day 30 post-HSCT (P < .01). We also divided the rejected group into those who experienced primary (n = 5) and secondary graft rejection (n = 5) and found that engrafted patients had significantly higher Tsp-1 levels compared with patients who developed primary graft rejection at days +60 and +100 (P < .05), as well as higher Pf-4 levels compared with patients who developed primary graft rejection at post-transplantation (PT) day 100. Furthermore, Tsp-1 levels were significantly higher at PT days 60 and 100 and Pf-4 levels were higher at PT day 100 in engrafted patients compared with those who experienced secondary graft rejection. Increased concentrations of plasma Gal-1, Tsp-1, and Pf-4 could reflect increased T regulatory cells, IL-10, and TGF-beta, which are essential players in the initiation of immunologic tolerance. These biomarkers may provide opportunities for preemptive intervention to minimize the incidence of graft rejection.
34889373		How to avoid the problem of erythrocyte alloimmunization in sickle cell disease.Erythrocyte alloimmunization is a major barrier to transfusion in sickle cell disease (SCD) because it can lead to transfusion deadlock and the development of life-threatening hemolytic transfusion reactions (HTRs). Several risk factors have been identified, such as blood group polymorphism in these patients of African ancestry frequently exposed to antigens they do not carry and an inflammatory clinical state of the disease. The most important preventive measure is prophylactic red blood cell antigen matching, and there is a consensus that matching for Rh (D, C, E, c, e) and K antigens should be performed for all SCD patients. However, some patients are high responders and more at risk of developing antibodies and HTRs. For these patients, the extension of matching to other blood groups, including variant antigens of the RH blood group, the use of genotyping rather than serology to characterize significant blood groups, and the prophylactic administration of immunosuppressive treatments remain a matter of debate due to low levels of certainty concerning their effects and the difficulty of determining which patients, other than those already immunized, are at high risk. These issues were recently addressed by a panel of experts established by the American Society of Hematology. Here, we review and stratify the various interventions for preventing alloimmunization, based on the literature and our experience and taking into account the obstacles to their implementation and any future developments required.
34077086		Live birth following preimplantation genetic testing to prevent sickle cell disease in a low resource setting: A case report.Preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic disorders (PGT-M) can detect sickle cell disease (HbSS) in embryos during In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF), to ensure the birth of unaffected children. The prevalence of haemoglobin S gene (HbS) is high in Nigeria and Sub-Saharan Africa, but access to PGT-M services in the setting is limited. A couple with the sickle cell trait (HbAS) had IVF, following which 12 embryos were biopsied and the corresponding cells analyzed using minisequencing for whole genome amplification and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to determine each embryo's haemoglobin (Hb) genotype. Two HbAA (normal) embryos were transferred to the mother resulting in the birth of a live HbAA male infant at 38 weeks gestation. The child has remained well after nine months of follow up with HbAA at repeat genotype evaluation.

Its association with several adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs) has been reported but remains inconsistent. The objectives of this study are to test associations of SCT with APOs in non-Hispanic Black women, including (1) validate the associations of SCT with previously reported APOs, (2) test novel associations of SCT with broad spectrum of APOs, and (3) estimate the attributable risk of SCT for implicated APOs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of a prospectively designed population-based cohort. Subjects were self-reported non-Hispanic Black women from the UK Biobank (UKB). SCT status was determined based on heterozygous Glu6Val in the HBB gene. Several APOs were studied, including four previously reported SCT-associated APOs (preeclampsia, bacteriuria, pregnancy loss, and preterm delivery), and broad conditions related to pregnancy, childbirth, and the puerperium. APOs were curated by experts' peer review and consensus processes. Associations of SCT with APOs were tested by estimating its relative risk and 95% confidence interval (95% CI), adjusting for number of live births and age at first birth. Attributable risk proportion (ARP) and population attributable risk proportion (PARP) of SCT to APOs were estimated. RESULTS: Among the 4057 self-reported non-Hispanic Black women with pregnancy records in the UKB, 581 (14.32%) were SCT carriers. For four previously reported SCT-associated APOs, two were confirmed at a nominal P < 0.05; relative risk (RR) was 2.39 (95% CI 1.09-5.23) for preeclampsia, and 4.85 (95% CI 1.77-13.27) for bacteriuria. SCT contributed substantially to these two APOs among SCT carriers, with attributable risk proportion estimated at 61.00% and 68.96% for preeclampsia and bacteriuria, respectively. SCT also contributed substantially to these two APOs in the population (self-reported Black UK women), with population attributable risk proportion estimated at 18.30% and 24.14% for preeclampsia and bacteriuria, respectively. In addition, novel associations were found for seven other APOs (nominal P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: SCT is significantly associated with APOs in this study and contributes substantially to APOs among self-reported Black women in the UK. Confirmation of these findings in independent study populations is required.

35891584		Neuropsychological, behavioral, and quality-of-life outcomes in children and adolescents with sickle cell disease treated with nonmyeloablative matched sibling donor hematopoietic cell transplantation: A case series.BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Despite advances in the treatment of sickle cell disease (SCD), cerebrovascular and cognitive insults can have lifelong consequences. Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is an established curative therapy, and recent studies have demonstrated efficacy with reduced toxicity nonmyeloablative (NMA) regimens, but little is known about neuropsychological outcomes. The objective of this study was to describe neuropsychological, behavioral, and quality-of-life outcomes with medical correlates in children with SCD who received an NMA matched sibling donor (MSD) HCT. DESIGN/METHODS: Retrospective cohort analysis of nine recipients with hemoglobin SS SCD who underwent MSD HCT using the National Institutes of Health (NIH) NMA protocol. RESULTS: Mean full-scale intellectual functioning (FSIQ) was average pre-HCT (FSIQ = 92.1, SD 9.0; n = 8) and 2 years post-HCT (mean FSIQ = 96.6; SD 11.1; N = 9). Neuropsychological functioning was largely average across all cognitive domains, and no pre/post-HCT differences were found to be statistically significant given the small sample size. However, effect sizes revealed moderate improvements in processing speed (Cohen's d = .72) and verbal memory (Cohen's d = .60) post-HCT, and declines in measures of attention (Cohen's d = -.54) and fine motor speed and dexterity (Cohen's d = -.94). Parents endorsed better quality of life (Cohen's d = .91), less impact of SCD on their family, and less worry about their child's future (Cohen's d = 1.44). CONCLUSION: Neuropsychological functioning in a sample of children and adolescents treated uniformly with NMA MSD HCT remained stable or improved in most cognitive domains, and improvements in quality of life and family functioning were observed.
36975201		Gene therapy in sickle cell disease: Attitudes and informational needs of patients and caregivers.BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited blood disorder that results in serious morbidity and early mortality. Novel therapies for SCD, most notably genetic therapies (GTs) and HLA-mismatched donor hematopoietic cell transplantation, are in clinical trials. While potentially curative, these interventions are some of the most intensive treatments for SCD and are associated with serious and life-altering side effects, which may manifest several years after treatment. Little is known about knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes of individuals with SCD, or their caregivers, toward existing and these emerging therapies. METHODS: Patients with SCD at least 13 years of age (n = 66) and caregivers (n = 38) were surveyed about knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs surrounding treatments for SCD. RESULTS: Only 4.8% felt "extremely knowledgeable" about GT for SCD while the majority (63.4%) reported little knowledge. Overall, health literacy was low among respondents. Most respondents had a neutral attitude regarding the safety of GT for SCD, and whether it was a good treatment for the disorder (56.7% and 58.6%, respectively). Only a few respondents endorsed the idea that GT was "unsafe" or "not a good treatment" (5.8% and 4.8%, respectively). There was an association between increasing knowledge about GT and agreement that it is safe (p = .012) and a good treatment for SCD (p = .031). CONCLUSIONS: Given that very few patients with SCD feel knowledgeable about GT and a majority have neutral feelings about the safety and utility of this new approach, culturally appropriate patient-centered education is urgently needed as these treatments get regulatory approval and proceed to the clinic.
33862367		Co-morbidities and mortality in patients with sickle cell disease in England: A 10-year cohort analysis using hospital episodes statistics (HES) data.Patients with a primary diagnosis of sickle cell disease (SCD) with or without crisis during the 10-year period January 2009 to December 2018 were identified in the HES Admitted Patient Care (APC) dataset and matched with the Office for National Statistics (ONS) mortality dataset. Three sub-cohorts were defined: 'crises', 'transfusions' and 'other SCD'. APC records were examined for co-morbidities commonly associated with SCD and 10-year mortality rates compared with the general population. After data cleaning and exclusions, 9503 patients remained (entire cohort), with 1171, 201, and 8131 in crises, transfusions, and other SCD sub-cohorts, respectively. Median numbers of co-morbidities per patient were 2 (Interquartile range (IQR): 1-4), 2 (IQR: 1-3), and 1 (IQR: 0-2) in the crises, transfusions, and other SCD sub-cohorts, respectively. The majority of patients in the crises (63.2%) and transfusions (56.3%) cohorts had >=2 co-morbidities, compared with 25.3% in the other SCD sub-cohort. Crude 10-year mortality rate was 5.3% (entire cohort), compared with 8.0% (crises) and 11.4% (transfusions) sub-cohorts; all rates were substantially higher than in age-sex matched general population. Our study adds further evidence that morbidity and mortality associated with SCD in England is high.

In that clinical context, red blood cells (RBCs) from donors and transfused to patients, may be affected by plasma components in the recipients' blood. Senescence lesion markers appear on the red cells after transfusion, shortening the RBC lifespan in circulation. In the specific context of SCD, senescence signals can also trigger the occlusive painful events, typical of the disease. This work follows through our previous data that described a RBC senescence process, rapidly detected after challenge with SCD pathological plasmas. In this clinical context, we wanted here to further explore the characteristics and physiologic consequences of AA RBC lesions associated with senescence, as lesions caused by RBCs after transfusion may have adverse consequences for SCD patients. METHODS: Plasma samples from SCD patients, with acute symptoms (n = 20) or steady-state disease (n = 34) were co-incubated with donor AA RBCs from blood units for 24 to 48 h. Specific markers signing RBC senescence were quantified after the incubation with SCD plasma samples. The physiologic in-flow adhesion was investigated on senescent RBCs, an in vitro technic into biochips that mimic adherence of RBCs during the occlusive events of SCD. RESULTS: Senescence markers on AA RBCs, together with their in-flow adhesion to the plasma-bridging protein thrombospondin, were associated with the clinical status of the SCD patients from whom plasma was obtained. In these experiments, the highest values were obtained for SCD acute plasma samples. Adhesion of senescent RBCs into biochips, which is not reversed by a pre-treatment with recombinant Annexin V, can be reproduced with the use of chemical agents acting on RBC membrane channels that regulate either Ca2+ entry or modulating RBC hydration. CONCLUSION: We found that markers on red cells are correlated, and that the senescence induced by SCD plasma provokes the adhesion of RBCs to the vessel wall protein thrombospondin. In-flow adhesion of senescent red cells after plasma co-incubations can be reproduced with the use of modulators of RBC membrane channels; activating the Piezo1 Ca2+ mechanosensitive channel provokes RBC adhesion of normal (non-senescent) RBCs, while blocking the Ca2+-dependent K+ Gardos channel, can reverse it. Clinically modulating the RBC adhesion to vascular wall proteins might be a promising avenue for the treatment of painful occlusive events in SCD.

This involves a variety of techniques, including microscopic analysis of stained blood films, flow cytometry, and cell counting. Here, we analyzed SCD blood using imaging flow cytometry (IFC), a technology that combines flow cytometry and microscopy to enable simultaneous rapid-throughput analysis of cellular morphology and cell-surface markers. With IFC, we were able to automate quantification of poikilocytes from SCD blood. An important subpopulation of poikilocytes represented dense cells, although these could not be distinguished from other poikilocytes without first centrifuging the blood through density gradients. In addition, CD71-positive RBCs from SCD patients had two subpopulations: one with high CD71 expression and a puckered morphology and another with lower CD71 expression and biconcave morphology and presumably representing a later stage of differentiation. Some RBCs with puckered morphologies that were strongly positive for DAPI and CD49d were in fact nucleated RBCs. IFC identified more phosphatidylserine-expressing red cells in SCD than did conventional flow cytometry and these could also be divided into two subpopulations. One population had diffuse PS expression and appeared to be composed primarily of RBC ghosts; the other had lower overall PS expression present in intense, punctate dots overlying Howell-Jolly bodies. This study demonstrates that IFC can rapidly reveal and quantify RBC features in SCD that require numerous tedious methods to identify conventionally. Thus, IFC is likely to be a useful technique for evaluating and monitoring SCD.
36990650		Orbital bone infarction masquerading as preseptal cellulitis in a child with sickle beta-thalassaemia.Although several ophthalmic manifestations of sickle cell disease (SCD) are common, orbital bone infarction is rare. Orbital bones have less bone marrow creating an unlikely place to develop infarction. However, having a patient with SCD presenting with periorbital swelling should warrant imaging to rule out bone infarction. We present a case of a child with sickle beta-thalassaemia who was misdiagnosed with preseptal cellulitis in the right eye. Later upon review of the subtle signs of bone infarction in imaging, she was discovered to have orbital bone infarction.
37696394		Longitudinal Assessment of Macular Thickness and Microvascular Changes in Children with Sickle Cell Disease.PURPOSE: To longitudinally assess macular thickness and microvascular changes in children with sickle cell disease (SCD). DESIGN: A retrospective consecutive series. SUBJECTS: Children with SCD aged 18 years old or less who had an ophthalmic exam at Boston Children's Hospital between January 1998 and August 2022. METHODS: Qualitative and quantitative analyses of both optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography (OCTA) images were performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Total retinal thickness measured on macular OCT, as well as superficial capillary plexus (SCP) and deep capillary plexus (DCP) vessel density (VD), and foveal avascular zone (FAZ) area measured on 6 x 6 mm OCTA scans. RESULTS: ICD-10 code search identified 303 pediatric SCD patients who underwent ophthalmic exam during the study period. OCT and OCTA images were acquired on 104 (17.2%) and 60 (9.9%) eyes at presentation and on 159 (26.2%) and 100 (16.5%) eyes at final visit. Overall, temporal retinal thinning was noted qualitatively in 35.6% of SCD patients at presentation and 39.6% at final visit. Of those patients with macular thinning, 94.6% and 90.5% had peripheral sickle cell retinopathy (SCR) at presentation and final visit. On quantitative OCT analysis, HbSS eyes had a lower retinal thickness in the fovea and temporal parafovea compared with HbSC, P < 0.05. Eyes with peripheral SCR had a larger FAZ at presentation compared to eyes without peripheral SCR (P = 0.004), a lower DCP VD at final visit in the inferior temporal macula (P = 0.03), and a higher DCP VD at final visit in the superior nasal macula (P = 0.01). 80 eyes of 40 patients had OCT and 34 eyes of 20 patients had both OCT and OCTA images acquired at both initial and final visits. At final visit, retinal thickness decreased at the fovea, inferior perifovea, and temporal perifovea compared to presentation, P < 0.05. In parallel, VD DCP in the superonasal quadrant increased at final visit, P = 0.03. CONCLUSIONS: Macular retinal thinning was progressive and observed in eyes with and without peripheral SCR. Over time, there was a compensatory increase in DCP VD in the nasal macula on OCTA.
36048130	treat|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell	Advanced clinical parameters: A complementary hydroxyurea adherence evaluation in sickle cell anemia treatment.OBJECTIVES: Given the complex pathology of sickle cell anemia (SCA) and low adherence to hydroxyurea (HU) treatment, there is a need to seek parameters that identify recent changes in patient status. The advanced clinical parameters (ACPs) allow an early analysis of hematopoiesis. We aimed to draw the demographic profile of non-adherent SCA patients and to verify the use of ACPs as a measure of HU treatment adherence. METHOD: In a cross-sectional study, we divided 83 SCA subjects treated with HU into Children (<12 years old) and adolescents/adults (>=12 years old). Their hemogram with the ACPs, electronic medical charts and pharmacy claim data were analyzed. RESULTS: Non-adherent >=12 years old patients had significantly increased WBC, absolute neutrophil, lymphocyte, monocyte, and basophil counts, RBC, RET, RDW, and PLT, and significantly decreased MCV and MCH. Subjects in the adolescent/adult group with IG  >=0.035 cells/mm3 had the RR for non-adherence increased by 4.6 times (p = .014), and the systemic immune inflammation index (SII) of non-adherent patients was also significantly higher (p = .042). CONCLUSION: IG  presents clinical utility in early identification of non-adherence to HU, especially when combined with other parameters, suggesting the evaluation of ACPs in laboratory routine, as they can be easily implemented.
34259758		Dengue fever as a potential cause of sickle cell intrahepatic cholestasis: A report of two cases.Sickle cell intrahepatic cholestasis is a potentially fatal syndrome characterized by jaundice, painful hepatomegaly, and organ dysfunction. Two cases of sickle cell intrahepatic cholestasis associated with dengue fever were described. Endothelial damage/dysfunction is a mechanism involved in severe hepatobiliary complications related to sickle cell diseases. However, the reasons for the lack of increase in the admission of patients with sickle cell disease having severe acute hepatobiliary complications triggered by endothelial damage/dysfunction due to dengue fever remain unknown. This study describes the first association between sickle cell intrahepatic cholestasis and dengue fever.

34527156		Variation in pulmonary function tests among children with sickle cell anemia: a systematic review and meta-analysis.INTRODUCTION: the spectrum of pulmonary complications in sickle cell anemia (SCA) comprises mainly of acute chest syndrome (ACS), pulmonary hypertension (PH) and airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR). This study was conducted to examine the abnormalities in pulmonary function tests (PFTs) seen in children with SCA. METHODS: electronic databases (Cochrane library, PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science) were used as data sources. Two authors independently reviewed studies. All case-control studies with PFT performed in patients with SCA and normal controls were reviewed. Pulmonary functions were assessed with the help of spirometry, lung volume and gas diffusion findings. RESULTS: nine studies with 788 SCA children and 1101 controls were analyzed. For all studies, the pooled mean difference for forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV1/FVC ratio, peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), total lung capacity (TLC) and carbon mono-oxide diffusing capacity (DLCO) were -12.67, (95% CI: -15.41,-9.94), -11.69, (95% CI: -14.24, -9.14), -1.90, (95% CI: -4.32, 0.52), -3.36 (95% CI: -6.69, -0.02), -7.35, (95% CI: -14.97, -0.27) and -4.68, (95% CI -20.64, -11.29) respectively. FEV1 and FVC and were the only parameters found to be significantly decreased. CONCLUSION: sickle cell anemia was associated with lower FEV1 and FVC, thus, supporting the role of routine monitoring for the progression of lung function decline in children with SCA with ACS. We recommend routine screening and lung function monitoring for early recognition of pulmonary function decline.
35471555		Risk of vaso-occlusive episode after exposure to corticosteroids in patients with sickle cell disease.Vaso-occlusive episodes (VOEs) are a major concern in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Exposure to systemic corticosteroids has been suspected to increase the occurrence of VOEs in case reports or series. No comparative study has been conducted to investigate this risk, which is still debated. Several clinical trials demonstrated the effectiveness of corticosteroids for the treatment of VOEs, but with increased rates of readmission. The aim of the study was to assess the risk of hospitalization for VOE associated with exposure to systemic corticosteroids in patients with SCD. We used a case-case-time-control design in a nationwide population-based cohort built in the French national health insurance database between 2010 and 2018. The population included all patients with SCD with at least 1 hospitalization for VOE. Corticosteroids were identified using out-of-hospital dispensing data. The outcome was the first hospitalization for VOE. The case-case-time-control design induces self-adjustment for time-invariant confounders, including genotype. Analyses were adjusted for time-dependent confounders (infections, red blood transfusions) and stratified by exposure to hydroxyurea. Overall, 5151 patients were included in the main analysis. Corticosteroid exposure was significantly associated with the occurrence of hospitalizations for VOEs: adjusted odds ratio, 3.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.4-5.6). In patients exposed to hydroxyurea, the adjusted odds ratio was 2.6 (95% CI, 1.1-6.4); it was 4.0 (95% CI, 2.5-6.3) in unexposed patients. These results were consistent in children and adults. In conclusion, systemic corticosteroids were associated to an increased risk of hospitalization for VOEs and should be limited in patients with SCD.
35007552		Hematology Emergencies in Critically Ill Adults: Benign Hematology.Hematologic conditions (malignant or benign) may progress to acute critical illness requiring prompt recognition and intensive management. This review outlines diagnostic considerations and approaches to management for intensivists of common benign hematologic emergencies, including the following: thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, catastrophic antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, acute chest syndrome associated with sickle cell disease, and hyperhemolysis syndrome.
34586618		Innovations in CRISPR-Based Therapies.Gene and cell therapies have shown tremendous advancement in the last 5 years. Prominent examples include the successful use of CRISPR-edited stem cells for treating blood disorders like sickle cell anemia and beta-thalassemia, and ongoing clinical trials for treating blindness. This mini-review assesses the status of CRISPR-based therapies, both in vivo and ex vivo, and the challenges associated with clinical translation. In vivo CRISPR therapies have been used to treat eye and liver diseases due to the practicality of delivering editing components to the target tissue. In contrast, even though ex vivo CRISPR therapy involves cell isolation, expansion, and infusion, its advantages include characterizing the gene edits before infusion and restricting off-target effects in other tissues. Further, the safety, affordability, and feasibility of CRISPR therapies, especially for treating large number of patients, are discussed.
36273784		Long-Term Organ Function After HCT for SCD: A Report From the Sickle Cell Transplant Advocacy and Research Alliance.Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is an established cure for sickle cell disease (SCD) supported by long-term survival, but long-term organ function data are lacking. We sought to describe organ function and assess predictors for dysfunction in a retrospective cohort (n = 247) through the Sickle cell Transplant Advocacy and Research alliance. Patients with <1-year follow-up or graft rejection/second HCT were excluded. Organ function data were collected from last follow-up. Primary measures were organ function, comparing pre- and post-HCT. Bivariable and multivariable analyses were performed for predictors of dysfunction. Median age at HCT was 9.4 years; the majority had HbSS (88.2%) and severe clinical phenotype (65.4%). Most received matched related (76.9%) bone marrow (83.3%) with myeloablative conditioning (MAC; 57.1%). Acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) developed in 24.0% and 24.8%. Thirteen patients (5.3%) died >=1 year after HCT, primarily from GVHD or infection. More post-HCT patients had low ejection or shortening fractions than pre-HCT (0.6%   6.0%, P = .007 and 0%   4.6%, P = .003). The proportion with lung disease remained stable. Eight patients (3.2%) had overt stroke; most had normal (28.3%) or stable (50.3%) brain magnetic resonance imaging. On multivariable analysis, cardiac dysfunction was associated with MAC (odds ratio [OR] = 2.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09-6.77; P = .033) and severe acute GVHD (OR = 2.41; 95% CI, 1.04-5.62; P = .041). Neurologic events were associated with central nervous system indication (OR = 2.88; 95% CI, 2.00-4.12; P < .001). Overall organ dysfunction was associated with age >=16 years (OR = 2.26; 95% CI, 1.35-3.78; P = .002) and clinically severe disease (OR = 1.64; 95% CI, 1.02-2.63; P = .043). In conclusion, our results support consideration of HCT at younger age and use of less intense conditioning.
33983401		Screening for Cognitive Dysfunction Using the Rowland Universal Dementia Assessment Scale in Adults With Sickle Cell Disease.Importance: Adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) disproportionally experience early cognitive decline; however, guidance on the optimal screening strategy for cognitive dysfunction is lacking, and several available tools are biased by language, educational level, socioeconomic status, and race/ethnicity. The Rowland Universal Dementia Assessment Scale (RUDAS) was specifically designed for cognitive screening in multicultural populations. Objective: To ascertain the prevalence of suspected dementia in adults with SCD using the RUDAS, and to identify whether age, sex, educational level, several biological variables, and SCD complications were associated with RUDAS scores. Design, Setting, and Participants: This multicenter, bilingual, cross-sectional study was conducted in 2 SCD comprehensive care centers in Canada (Centre Hospitalier de l'Universite Montreal in Montreal and University Health Network in Toronto). Participants were adults aged 18 years or older and were enrolled in the study between July 1, 2018, and July 30, 2019. All outpatients were eligible and offered study participation, unless they had an acute medical condition that required inpatient care or they were unable to follow study instructions. Interventions: The RUDAS was administered by trained personnel in either French or English, according to the patient's language preference. A questionnaire on social determinants of health was also administered, and participants underwent screening for anxiety and depression. Main Outcomes and Measures: Proportion of participants with RUDAS scores that were suggestive of dementia and the RUDAS score. Any score lower than 23 points was suggestive of dementia, a score between 23 and 27 points indicated a possible association with mild neurocognitive disorder, and a score higher than 27 points was normal. Results: A total of 252 adult patients with SCD were included (136 women [54.0%]; mean [range] age, 34.8 [18-75] years). Overall, 29 patients (11.5%) had RUDAS scores that were suggestive of dementia, and this proportion increased with age (15 [8.7%] in the 18-39 years age group, 10 [14.5%] in the 40-59 years age group, and 4 [36.4%] in the >=60 years age group). The RUDAS scores were not associated with sex, language, SCD genotype, and SCD complications. The highest level of education was significantly associated with the RUDAS score; however, the association was small (eta2 = 0.02; 95% CI, 0.00-0.07; P = .02). In a multivariable analysis, lower glomerular filtration rate (r = 0.40; 95% CI, 0.29-0.50; P < .001) and increasing age (r = -0.37; 95% CI, -0.47 to -0.26; P < .001), but not SCD genotype or disease severity, were associated with lower RUDAS scores. Conclusions and Relevance: This study found that using the RUDAS revealed a high prevalence of suspected dementia in adult patients with SCD that was associated with worsening kidney function and age. Cognition should be screened in all adult patients with SCD, regardless of age, disease severity, and SCD genotype; further validation of the RUDAS is ongoing.
37833213		Concurrent Cholecystectomy Does Not Increase Splenectomy Morbidity in Patients With Hemolytic Anemia: A Pediatric NSQIP Analysis.PURPOSE: Children undergoing splenectomy for hemolytic anemia often have cholelithiasis, which may or may not be symptomatic. It is unclear whether concurrent cholecystectomy increases length of stay or morbidity after splenectomy. The purpose of this study was to compare morbidity among children undergoing laparoscopic splenectomy alone versus splenectomy with concurrent cholecystectomy in patients with hemolytic anemia. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated children with hemolytic anemia undergoing non-traumatic laparoscopic splenectomy in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program-Pediatric database (2012-2020). Outcomes were compared for patients undergoing splenectomy alone (n = 1010) versus splenectomy with cholecystectomy (n = 371). Pearson's Chi-square and Student's t-tests were utilized as appropriate. Propensity score-matching was completed, controlling for eight demographic and clinical variables. RESULTS: 1381 patients were identified, 73.1% undergoing splenectomy alone and 26.9% splenectomy with cholecystectomy. Splenectomy with cholecystectomy patients were older (10.9 years vs. 8.4 years, p < 0.01), more likely to have hereditary spherocytosis (56.1% vs. 40.8%, p < 0.01), less likely to have sickle cell disease (12.1% vs. 33.5%, p < 0.01), more likely ASA class 1 or 2 (49.3% vs. 42.1%, p < 0.01), and had similar preoperative hematocrit levels (29.6 vs. 29.3, p = 0.33). The splenectomy with cholecystectomy group was less likely to receive preoperative blood transfusions (13.5% vs. 25.4%, p < 0.01). There were 360 pairs selected on propensity score-matching, and splenectomy with cholecystectomy was associated with increased operative time (182 min vs. 145 min, p < 0.01) and decreased occurrences of a postoperative transfusion (4.2% vs. 8.9%, p = 0.01). Length of stay after surgery (2.5 days vs. 2.3 days, p = 0.13), composite morbidity (3.9% vs. 3.4%, p = 0.69), and 30-day readmission rates (3.3% vs. 7.4%, p = 0.08) were all similar. CONCLUSIONS: Splenectomy with cholecystectomy is associated with similar postoperative morbidity, length of stay and readmission rates compared to splenectomy alone. These data support the safety of concurrent cholecystectomy with splenectomy for children with cholelithiasis in the setting of hemolytic anemia. TYPE OF STUDY: Retrospective Cohort Study. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III.

36062975		Clinical outcome of pre-operative blood transfusion for sickle cell disease patients in post-operative complications.BACKGROUND: Preoperative blood transfusion for patients with sickle cell disease is a debatable topic and it can be lifesaving. Sickle cell disease patients are at high risk for vaso-occlusive crisis due to the large concentration of sickle hemoglobin (HgbS) in their blood. Despite the current extensive research into this disease, there is still no consensus over whether blood transfusion is a preferable preoperative modality among patients undergoing elective surgical procedures. METHOD: A retrospective observational study, which enrolled 204 patients with Sickle cell disease who underwent surgery at King Fahad Hospital of the University (KFHU) over the last five years. The primary objective was to determine whether there is evidence that preoperative blood transfusion for SCD patients undergoing surgical procedures will reduce postoperative complications related to SCD. RESULTS: A total of 204 patients were included, of which 30% had preoperative blood transfusion. Majority of patient 44% had undergone cholecystectomy. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, patients who did not undergo blood transfusion had significantly higher risk to develop post-operative SCD complications (OR = 3.07, P value = 0.002). In addition, they had significantly prolonged hospitalization (OR = 2.22, P value = 0.08). In contrast, patients who received blood transfusion had lower risk for developing post-operative SCD-related complications (OR = 1.87, P value = 0.29), and decrease in the duration of hospitalization by (OR = 0.49, P value = 0.045). CONCLUSION: Our study showed that patients who had not undergone preoperative blood transfusion had higher risk to develop postoperative complications and prolonged hospital stay compared to those who underwent blood transfusion.
36273803		Clinical outcomes and 30-day readmissions associated with high-output heart failure.BACKGROUND: High-output heart failure (HOHF) is an underdiagnosed type of heart failure (HF) characterized by low systemic vascular resistance and high cardiac output. OBJECTIVE: This study sought to characterize the causes, mortality, and readmissions related to HOHF within the United States. METHODS: Data were collected from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) National Readmissions Database (NRD) from January 1, 2017, to November 30, 2019. We used the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10), diagnostic codes to identify encounters with HOHF and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). RESULTS: Of the total 5,080,985 encounters with HF, 3,897 hospitalizations (mean age 62.5 +- 17.9 years, 56.5% females) with HOHF and 5,077,088 hospitalizations with HFrEF were recorded. The most commonly associated putative etiologies of HOHF included pulmonary disease (19.8%), morbid obesity (9.9%), sepsis (9.6%), cirrhosis (8.9%), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (7.9%), hyperthyroidism (5.5%), and sickle cell disease (3.3%). There was no significant difference in mortality rates [4.3% vs. 5.2%; odds ratio (OR) 0.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.7-1.2] between HOHF and HFrEF. However, the 30-day readmission rate for HOHF was significantly lower than that for HFrEF (5.7% vs. 21.2%; OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.30-0.51). Cardiovascular (39.9%) followed by hematological (20.6%) complications accounted for the majority of 30-day readmissions in the HOHF group. CONCLUSIONS: HOHF is an infrequently reported cardiovascular complication associated with noncardiovascular disorders and is encountered in 0.07% of all encounters with HF. Although comparable in-hospital mortality between studied cohorts was observed, raising awareness and timely recognition of this entity are warranted.
34378625	treat|@CHEMICAL_5_hydroxymethylfurfural|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell ;associate|@CHEMICAL_5_hydroxymethylfurfural|@CHEMICAL_Oxygen ;associate|@CHEMICAL_Oxygen|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell	In vitro assay for single-cell characterization of impaired deformability in red blood cells under recurrent episodes of hypoxia.Red blood cells (RBCs) are subjected to recurrent changes in shear stress and oxygen tension during blood circulation. The cyclic shear stress has been identified as an important factor that alone can weaken cell mechanical deformability. The effects of cyclic hypoxia on cellular biomechanics have yet to be fully investigated. As the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin plays a key role in the biological function and mechanical performance of RBCs, the repeated transitions of hemoglobin between its R (high oxygen tension) and T (low oxygen tension) states may impact their mechanical behavior. The present study focuses on developing a novel microfluidic-based assay for characterization of the effects of cyclic hypoxia on cell biomechanics. The capability of this assay is demonstrated by a longitudinal study of individual RBCs in health and sickle cell disease subjected to cyclic hypoxia conditions of various durations and levels of low oxygen tension. The viscoelastic properties of cell membranes are extracted from tensile stretching and relaxation processes of RBCs induced by the electrodeformation technique. Results demonstrate that cyclic hypoxia alone can significantly reduce cell deformability, similar to the fatigue damage accumulated through cyclic mechanical loading. RBCs affected by sickle cell disease are less deformable (significantly higher membrane shear modulus and viscosity) than normal RBCs. The fatigue resistance of sickle RBCs to the cyclic hypoxia challenge is significantly inferior to that of normal RBCs, and this trend is more significant in mature erythrocytes of sickle cells. When the oxygen affinity of sickle hemoglobin is enhanced by anti-sickling drug treatment of 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furfural (5-HMF), sickle RBCs show ameliorated resistance to fatigue damage induced by cyclic hypoxia. These results indicate an important biophysical mechanism underlying RBC senescence in which the cyclic hypoxia challenge alone can lead to mechanical degradation of the RBC membrane. We envision that the application of this assay can be further extended to RBCs in other blood diseases and other cell types.
34727959		A systematic literature review of frequency of vaso-occlusive crises in sickle cell disease.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a collection of rare inherited blood disorders affecting approximately 100,000 people in the U.S. and 20-25 million people globally. Individuals with SCD experience recurrent episodes of severe and unpredictable pain that are caused by vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs), a hallmark of the disease. VOCs are the primary cause of hospitalization in SCD, result in missed workdays and school days, and decrease quality of life (QoL). Although VOCs cause significant burden in the lives of individuals with SCD, there is no synthesis on the frequency of VOCs in the real world. This systematic literature review sought to identify literature describing the frequency of VOCs experienced by individuals with SCD in real-world settings. METHODS: MEDLINE and 6 congresses were searched (date range: January 1, 2000 to June 30, 2020). Studies were reviewed independently by two researchers. Studies assessing frequency or prevalence of VOCs or VOC-related outcomes were included. RESULTS: Of 1438 studies identified in the search, 52 met pre-specified inclusion and exclusion criteria. Reported frequency of VOCs varied widely ranging from a mean or median of 0 VOCs/year to 18.2 VOCs/year. The proportion of patients experiencing >= 3 VOCs/year ranged from 4 to 67% and the proportion of patients experiencing >= 5 VOCs/year ranged from 18 to 59%. Measures of VOC severity were limited, with 13 studies considering frequency of complicated VOCs and only 1 study reporting duration of VOC episodes. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to systematically assess published evidence pertaining to VOCs in real-world settings. Reported VOC frequency in real-world settings varied widely, with a majority of studies only considering VOCs managed in an inpatient or outpatient setting. Studies that considered VOCs managed at home reported a higher frequency of VOCs, suggesting that many studies may underestimate the frequency of VOCs. This systematic literature review (SLR) highlights the need for consistent reporting of (1) self-reported VOCs, including those managed at home, (2) definitions of VOCs, (3) complicated VOCs, and (4) duration of VOC episodes in literature.

38444343		National Quality Indicators in Pediatric Sickle Cell Anemia.OBJECTIVE: To assess nationally endorsed claims-based quality measures in pediatric sickle cell anemia (SCA). METHODS: Using data from the Sickle Cell Data Collection programs in California and Georgia from 2010 to 2019, we evaluated 2 quality measures in individuals with hemoglobin S/S or S/beta-zero thalassemia: (1) the proportion of patients aged 3 months to 5 years who were dispensed antibiotic prophylaxis for at least 300 days within each measurement year and (2) the proportion of patients aged 2 to 15 years who received at least 1 transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) within each measurement year. We then evaluated differences by year and tested whether performance on quality measures differed according to demographic and clinical factors. RESULTS: Only 22.2% of those in California and 15.5% in Georgia met or exceeded the quality measure for antibiotic prophylaxis, with increased odds associated with rural residence in Georgia (odds ratio 1.61; 95% confidence interval 1.21-2.14) compared with urban residence and a trend toward increased odds associated with a pediatric hematologist prescriber (odds ratio 1.28; 95% confidence interval 0.97, 1.69) compared with a general pediatrician. Approximately one-half of the sample received an annual assessment of stroke risk using TCD (47.4% in California and 52.7% in Georgia), with increased odds each additional year in both states and among younger children. CONCLUSIONS: The rates of receipt of recommended antibiotic prophylaxis and annual TCD were low in this sample of children with SCA. These evidence-based quality measures can be tracked over time to help identify policies and practices that maximize survival in SCA.
37865561		Attitudes and Beliefs of Nurses and Nurse Assistants toward Patients with Sickle Cell Disease: A Mixed Methods Study.BACKGROUND: Pain experienced among individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD) is the primary requirement for hospitalization. PURPOSE: This study examined the relationship of age, race, and years of experience among medical-surgical nurses and nursing assistants to their attitudes in caring for SCD patients and identified barriers that influence pain management care. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: An explanatory sequential mixed-methods study design was used. Online survey data were collected among 56 participants and online interviews were conducted among three participants. METHODS: The General Perceptions of Sickle Cell Patients (GPSCP) Scale-17, composed of four subscales, assessed providers attitudes toward patients with SCD. Two subscales assessed providers' attitudes behaviors related to acute and chronic pain management. RESULTS: There was no relationship between age and years of experience to scores on four subscales. White/Caucasian study participants scored higher on the Red Flag Behaviors subscale, indicating that White/Caucasian participants had stronger beliefs concerning drug-seeking behaviors among SCD patients as compared to other ethnicities/races. Themes generated from the qualitative interview data analysis were: 1) reflections on one's own practice compared to others' practice; 2) communication as a barrier/facilitator to providing care; 3) lack of national guidelines; and 4) adjunct staff are critical to facilitating holistic care. CONCLUSIONS: Racial and ethnic differences exist among medical-surgical nurses and nursing assistants' attitudes. Poor communication and lack of national standards of care are barriers to providing high quality care. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Culturally sensitive care, based on current practice guidelines, is needed for improved pain management care for patients with SCD.

METHODS: This study was a parallel-group, prospective, randomized, double-blind, pragmatic trial. Participants were randomized to receive a single dose of either ketamine or morphine, infused over 30 min. Primary outcome was mean difference in the numerical pain rating scale (NPRS) score over 2 h. NPRS was recorded every 30 min for a maximum of 180 min and secondary outcomes were cumulative dose of opioids, emergency department (ED) length of stay, hospital admission, change in vital signs, and drug-related side effects. Authors performed the analysis using intention-to-treat principle. RESULT: A total of 278 adults with SCD and who presented with acute sickle VOC participated in this trial. A total of 138 were allocated to the ketamine group. Mean (+-standard deviation [SD]) NPRS scores over 2 h were 5.7 (+-2.13) and 5.6 (+-1.90) in the ketamine and morphine groups. The ketamine group received significantly lower cumulative doses of morphine during their ED stay (mean +- SD = 4.5 +- 4.6 mg) than of the morphine group (mean +- SD = 8.5 +- 7.55 mg). Both groups had similar rates of hospital admission: 6.3% in the ketamine group had drug-related side effects compared to 2.2% in the morphine group. CONCLUSION: Early use of ketamine in adults with VOC resulted in a meaningful reduction in pain scores over a 2-h period and reduced the cumulative morphine dose in the ED with no significant drug-related side effects in the ketamine-treated group.
36096996		Umbilical cord blood as a hematopoietic stem cell source in transplantation for pediatric sickle cell disease: current challenges and strategies.Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is the only established cure for sickle cell disease (SCD), a hemolytic disorder that arises due to a point mutation in the hemoglobin A gene. The result is an abnormal sickle hemoglobin (HbS) replacing hemoglobin A. Of the spectrum of sickle hemoglobinoapthies, homozygous (HbSS) and HbSbeta0 thalassemia manifest severe forms of disease characterized by chronic endothelial injury/vasculopathy, ischemic pain, and vital organ damage that commence in childhood and escalate with age resulting in impaired quality of life, increased healthcare burden, and early mortality. HSCT has demonstrated durable disease control and regression of symptoms. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched sibling donor (MSD) transplantation can achieve disease-free survival of > 90%. However, < 18% of SCD patients in the United States have a MSD. Familial mismatched and unrelated donors from registries provide alternate stem cell sources. Umbilical cord blood (UCB) from family or cord blood banks expand donor sources and are attractive due to donor-independent ease of use and availability. These naive cells tolerate greater degrees of HLA-mismatch. The primary challenge with UCB is optimizing cell dose toward successful engraftment and timely immune reconstitution while minimizing graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). This review summarizes evidence that UCB remains a promising stem cell source where modern methods of graft expansion, conditioning, GVHD prophylaxis, and infection control can overcome these challenges and retain the value of this intervention.
38426267		Causal Mediation of Neighborhood-Level Pediatric Hospitalization Inequities.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Population-wide racial inequities in child health outcomes are well documented. Less is known about causal pathways linking inequities and social, economic, and environmental exposures. Here, we sought to estimate the total inequities in population-level hospitalization rates and determine how much is mediated by place-based exposures and community characteristics. METHODS: We employed a population-wide, neighborhood-level study that included youth <18 years hospitalized between July 1, 2016 and June 30, 2022. We defined a causal directed acyclic graph a priori to estimate the mediating pathways by which marginalized population composition causes census tract-level hospitalization rates. We used negative binomial regression models to estimate hospitalization rate inequities and how much of these inequities were mediated indirectly through place-based social, economic, and environmental exposures. RESULTS: We analyzed 50 719 hospitalizations experienced by 28 390 patients. We calculated census tract-level hospitalization rates per 1000 children, which ranged from 10.9 to 143.0 (median 45.1; interquartile range 34.5 to 60.1) across included tracts. For every 10% increase in the marginalized population, the tract-level hospitalization rate increased by 6.2% (95% confidence interval: 4.5 to 8.0). After adjustment for tract-level community material deprivation, crime risk, English usage, housing tenure, family composition, hospital access, greenspace, traffic-related air pollution, and housing conditions, no inequity remained (0.2%, 95% confidence interval: -2.2 to 2.7). Results differed when considering subsets of asthma, type 1 diabetes, sickle cell anemia, and psychiatric disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide additional evidence supporting structural racism as a significant root cause of inequities in child health outcomes, including outcomes at the population level.
35141420		Deep learning-based classification of retinal vascular diseases using ultra-widefield colour fundus photographs.OBJECTIVE: To assess the ability of a deep learning model to distinguish between diabetic retinopathy (DR), sickle cell retinopathy (SCR), retinal vein occlusions (RVOs) and healthy eyes using ultra-widefield colour fundus photography (UWF-CFP). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In this retrospective study, UWF-CFP images of patients with retinal vascular disease (DR, RVO, and SCR) and healthy controls were included. The images were used to train a multilayer deep convolutional neural network to differentiate on UWF-CFP between different vascular diseases and healthy controls. A total of 224 UWF-CFP images were included, of which 169 images were of retinal vascular diseases and 55 were healthy controls. A cross-validation technique was used to ensure that every image from the dataset was tested once. Established augmentation techniques were applied to enhance performances, along with an Adam optimiser for training. The visualisation method was integrated gradient visualisation. RESULTS: The best performance of the model was obtained using 10 epochs, with an overall accuracy of 88.4%. For DR, the area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve (AUC) was 90.5% and the accuracy was 85.2%. For RVO, the AUC was 91.2% and the accuracy 88.4%. For SCR, the AUC was 96.7% and the accuracy 93.8%. For healthy controls, the ROC was 88.5% with an accuracy that reached 86.2%. CONCLUSION: Deep learning algorithms can classify several retinal vascular diseases on UWF-CPF with good accuracy. This technology may be a useful tool for telemedicine and areas with a shortage of ophthalmic care.

36173437		Modified DIVA Score: An Improved Clinical Predictive Tool for Detecting Difficult Access in Children.OBJECTIVE: This study aims to validate the DIVA (Difficult Intravenous Access) score in our population and to identify any additional patient characteristics that may be associated with difficult access in children. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study in an urban quaternary pediatric emergency department with patients younger than 21 years and Emergency Severity Index >=2 who require intravenous (IV) access for their management. In addition to patient characteristics comprising the DIVA score, data were collected on patient "history of difficult access," hydration status, skin shade, history of sickle cell disease or diabetes, technology dependence, and body mass index. The number of IV cannulation attempts and total time taken were recorded for each patient. "Difficult access" was defined as >=2 or more attempts or time >30 minutes to achieve successful IV cannulation. RESULTS: A convenience sample of 300 pediatric patients was enrolled. The DIVA score had a sensitivity of 51% (95% confidence interval [CI], 40.8%-61.14%) and a specificity of 82.99% (95% CI, 76.95%-87.99%) for predicting "difficult access" in our population. Among all patient characteristics examined in this study, only "history of difficult access" improved the identification of "difficult access" patients. The "history of difficult access" variable had a sensitivity of 61% (95% CI, 50.7%-70.6%) and a specificity of 75.7% (95% 95% CI, 69.12%-81.62%) in predicting "difficult access." With the addition of "history of difficult access" to the original DIVA score, we developed a "modified DIVA score (m-DIVA)." The m-DIVA score had a sensitivity of 78% (95% CI, 68.6%-85.6%) and specificity of 67% (95% CI, 59.9%-73.58%), representing a 52.9% improvement in correctly identifying "difficult access" patients over the original DIVA score. CONCLUSIONS: The m-DIVA score, which incorporates prior history, increases the screening test's sensitivity in identifying "difficult access" patients and should be further investigated as clinical tool.

38015105		Intravenous fluid therapy and hospital outcomes for vaso-occlusive episodes in children, adolescents, and young adults with sickle cell disease.BACKGROUND: While intravenous fluid (IVF) therapy in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) admitted for a vaso-occlusive episode (VOE) can help reduce red blood cell sickling, clinical practice varies across institutions. We examined the relationship between IVF therapy and hospital length of stay (HLOS), as well as adverse events, such as acute chest syndrome (ACS), pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) transfer, and 28-day re-admission. METHODS: This is a single-center retrospective analysis of SCD VOE hospitalizations between January 2015 and April 2020. Patients with SCD, age 0-30, with consecutive hospitalizations for VOE were included. For the first 3 days of each admission, an "IVF ratio" was calculated by dividing actual IVF rate administered by weight-based maintenance IVF (mIVF) rate. RESULTS: A total of 617 hospitalizations for 161 patients were included. Mean HLOS was 5.7 days, (SD 3.9), and mean IVF volume over the first 3 days of admission was 139.6 mL/kg/day (SD 57.8). Multivariate analysis showed that for each additional 0.5 times the mIVF rate, HLOS increased by 0.53 day (p < .001; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.609-0.989), but there was no significant association between IVF therapy and adverse events. History of chronic pain was associated with increased odds of re-admission (OR 6.4; 95% CI: 3.93-10.52). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the theoretical potential for IVF therapy to slow down the sickling process, our findings suggest that increased IVF therapy was associated with prolonged HLOS, which places a burden on patients, families, and the health system.
37863704		Debate: Should the loss of disability adjusted life years (DALY) define the focus of Global Hematology?: The case for prioritizing capacity building in anemia management and blood transfusion.Setting priorities in healthcare is always contentious given the array of possible services at primary, secondary, and tertiary levels of care, not to mention potential public health interventions. The central goals in global policy have been reducing inequity within and between countries, protecting vulnerable groups (particularly women and children) and reducing the major communicable diseases which have historically been a major burden in lower- and middle-income countries. Here limited relative and absolute spending on healthcare have spurred a series of initiatives in Global Health over the last 50 years which have led to significant gains in measures of morbidity and mortality. Against this background there remains the continuing question of how to adapt current medical practice in higher income countries for training and planning of services in lower- and middle-income countries. Here, the historical development of Global Health is outlined, and lessons drawn from the surveys of the global burden of disease and health economic analysis to understand how we can apply these principles to define Global Hematology. It remains likely that in lower-income countries effort should be concentrated on developing laboratory services and blood transfusion, to allow safe and effective support for the assessment of treatment of anemia, sickle cell disease, maternal and child health and urgent surgery and obstetric services. However, the principles of Global Health, could also be used for hematological malignancies to develop a framework for Global Hematology for all settings.
36718836		The management of chronic pain in sickle cell disease: an interview with Nadine Matthie.Nadine Matthie, PhD, RN, CNL is an Assistant Professor in the Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing at Emory University in Atlanta, GA, USA. As a nurse scientist, she has conducted behavioral research to investigate pain and self-management in adults living with sickle cell disease, and address chronic, non vaso-occlusive pain in this population. Dr Matthie is developing non pharmacological, patient-centered, self-management strategies that incorporate virtual reality and biopsychosocial approaches to help manage chronic pain and reduce the burden of sickle cell; thereby, facilitating new, personalized approaches to management of chronic pain conditions in the home setting. Her research has been published in several national and international peer-reviewed sources for various disciplines, including nursing, medicine, music therapy and psychology.
37883803		Cerebral hemodynamic changes after haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplant in adults with sickle cell disease.Preliminary evidence from four adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) suggests that hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) improves cerebral hemodynamics. HSCT largely normalizes cerebral hemodynamics in children with SCD. We tested the hypothesis in adults with SCD that cerebral blood flow (CBF), oxygen extraction fraction (OEF), and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) measured using MRI, normalized to healthy values, comparing measurements approximately one month before to 12-24 months following HSCT (n=11; age=33.3+-8.9 years; 389+-150 days post-HSCT) to age-, race- and sex-matched values from healthy adults without sickle trait (n=28; age=30.2+-5.6 years). Prior to transplant, 7 patients had neurological indications for transplant (e.g., overt stroke) and 4 had non-neurological reasons for haploidentical bone marrow transplant (haploBMT). All received haploBMT from first-degree relatives (parent, sibling, or child donor) with reduced-intensity preparation and maintained engraftment. Pre-transplant, CBF was elevated (CBF=69.11 24.7 ml/100g/min) compared to controls (p = 0.004). Mean CBF declined significantly following haploBMT (post-transplant CBF=48.2+-13.9 ml/100g/min, p=0.003). OEF was not different from controls at baseline and did not change significantly following HaploBMT (pre-transplant: 43.1 6.7%; post-transplant: 39.6 7.0%, p=0.34). Post-transplant, CBF and OEF were not significantly different from controls (CBF=48.2 13.4 ml/100g/min; p=0.78, and OEF=39.6 7.0%; p>0.99). CMRO2 did not change significantly following haploBMT (pre-transplant=3.18 0.87 ml O2/100g/min; post-transplant: 2.95 0.83; p=0.56). Major complications of haploBMT included one infection-related death and one severe chronic graft versus host disease. HaploBMT in adults with SCD reduces CBF to control values and maintains OEF and CMRO2 on average at levels observed in healthy adult controls.
34966094		Pupil Size and Reactivity in Pediatric Patients With Sickle Cell Disease.Pupil size and reactivity have been studied to objectively measure pain utilizing pupillometry measurements. Given the challenges associated with treating vaso-occlusive pain in pediatric patients with sickle cell disease, better assessment tools are needed. The objective of this study is to establish normative values for pupil size and reactivity in pediatric patients with sickle cell disease with the hope that pupillometry can be used as a tool to objectively measure pain and response to treatment with analgesic medications. Readings were performed using a NeurOptics PLR-2000 pupillometer. Forty-four males and 38 females, all black, were studied. Their median age was 11 years (range: 2 to 21). When comparing our participants with white participants in a previously published pediatric study, there was a significant difference in maximum constriction velocity ( t =3.45, P =0.009), maximum pupil size ( t =-5.57 mm, P <0.0001), and minimum pupil size ( t =-3.24, P =0.002). There was no significant difference in pupil size and reactivity between patients with sickle cell disease and black patients without the disease when compared with the previously published study. Therefore, further investigation of pupillometry within the black population during vaso-occlusive crisis and in the "well state" is warranted in pediatric patients with sickle cell disease.
34983646	treat|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Spinocerebellar_Ataxia_11 ;treat|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Stroke	Translating research to usual care of children with sickle cell disease in Northern Nigeria: lessons learned from the SPRING Trial Team.OBJECTIVES: Evidence-based practice for stroke prevention in high-income countries involves screening for abnormal transcranial Doppler (TCD) velocity and initiating regular blood transfusions for at least 1 year, followed by treatment with hydroxyurea. This practice has not been transferred to low-resource settings like Nigeria, the country with the highest global population density of SCD. Following a multi-center randomized controlled trial among children with SCA in northern Nigeria, screening for stroke and initiation of hydroxyurea was established as standard of care at the clinical trial sites and other locations. We aim to describe the critical steps we took in translating research into practice for stroke prevention in SCA in Nigeria. Guided by the PRISM framework, we describe how we translated results from a randomized controlled trial for primary prevention of stroke in children with sickle cell anemia into usual care for children with SCA in Kaduna, Nigeria. RESULTS: Findings from this study demonstrate the importance of organizational support and stakeholder involvement from the onset of a clinical trial. Having the dual objective of conducting an efficacy trial while simultaneously focusing on strategies for future implementation can significantly decrease the lag time between discovery and routine practice.
33631785		Biophysical and rheological biomarkers of red blood cell physiology and pathophysiology.PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review summarizes the significant biophysical and rheological aspects of red blood cell physiology and pathophysiology in relation to recent advances in microfluidic biomarker assays and emerging targeted or curative intent therapies. RECENT FINDINGS: Alterations in red cell biophysical properties and blood rheology have been associated with numerous hematologic and circulatory disorders. Recent advances in biomarker assays enable effective assessment of these biophysical and rheological properties in normoxia or physiological hypoxia in a clinically meaningful way. There are emerging targeted or curative therapies that aim to improve red cell pathophysiology, especially in the context of inherited hemoglobin disorders, such as sickle cell disease. SUMMARY: Red cell pathophysiology can be therapeutically targeted and the improvements in membrane and cellular biophysics and blood rheology can now be feasibly assessed via new microfluidic biomarker assays. Recent advances provide a new hope and novel treatment options for major red cell ailments, including inherited hemoglobin disorders, membrane disorders, and other pathologies of the red cell, such as malaria.
36368232		Thalassemia and Moyamoya Syndrome: Epidemiology and long-term outcome.OBJECTIVES: Moyamoya Angiopathy (MMA) is a chronic, progressive intracranial vasculopathy. Unlike Sickle-cell-disease, thalassemia-syndrome has rarely been described in association with MMA. This study was aimed to analyze the demographic, clinical, radiological features and long-term outcome (and possible factors influencing prognosis) of Moyamoya Syndrome (MMS) in the largest cohort of thalassemia-related-to-MMS. MATERIALS & METHODS: A single-centered, observational study with longitudinal follow-up was undertaken for 12 cases of MMS-related-to-thalassemia-syndrome amongst 160 consecutive MMA patients. The baseline demographic, clinical and radiological characteristics were noted; and were longitudinally followed-up to assess disease progression (clinical or radiological). Fifteen previously reported cases of thalassemia and MMA were retrieved by literature search in PubMed and Google-Scholar using keywords "Moyamoya" AND "thalassemia". RESULTS: The mean age at diagnosis of thalassemia-syndrome and diagnosis of MMS were 6.4 +- 6.55 years (mean +- SD) and 10.4 +- 8.68 years respectively in our 12 cases; 3.2 +- 2.25 years and 10.6 +- 6.1 years respectively in the previously reported 15 cases. Cerebral ischemic insult was the predominant brain lesion at base-line, noted in 91.7% of our cases and 80% of the previous cases. The mean hemoglobin, transfusion-dependency and previous splenectomy were seen in 8.7 +- 3.02 gm%, 33.3% and 8.3% of our cases respectively; 7.0 +- 3.04 gm%, 53.9% and 18.2% of previous cases. All our cases were medically managed for mean follow-up of 28.3 +- 13.9 months, none had evidence of angiographic progression, 1 of our 12 cases (8.3%) had new onset neuro-deficit and subsequent mortality, rest 11 of the 12 cases (91.7%) didn't have any appearance of silent cerebral infarction or evidence of progression of brain atrophy. Among the 15 previous cases, 5 out of 9 medically managed cases and 1 revascularized case described no further clinical recurrence. CONCLUSION: Thalassemia-related-MMS may not be so rare. Future development of consensus guidelines in diagnosing and managing cases of MMS-associated-with-thalassemia is of essence.
33894194	associate|@CHEMICAL_Oxygen|@DISEASE_Trauma_Nervous_System	Advances in neuroimaging to improve care in sickle cell disease.Sickle cell disease is associated with progressive and increased neurological morbidity throughout the lifespan. In people with sickle cell anaemia (the most common and severe type of sickle cell disease), silent cerebral infarcts are found in more than a third of adolescents by age 18 years and roughly half of young adults by age 30 years, many of whom have cognitive impairment despite having few or no conventional stroke risk factors. Common anatomical neuroimaging in individuals with sickle disease can assess structural brain injury, such as stroke and silent cerebral infarcts; however, emerging advanced neuroimaging methods can provide novel insights into the pathophysiology of sickle cell disease, including insights into the cerebral haemodynamic and metabolic contributors of neurological injury. Advanced neuroimaging methods, particularly methods that report on aberrant cerebral blood flow and oxygen delivery, have potential for triaging patients for appropriate disease-modifying or curative therapies before they have irreversible neurological injury, and for confirming the benefit of new therapies on brain health in clinical trials.
36729453		Comparisons of Severe Maternal Morbidity and Other Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes in Pregnant People With Sickle Cell Disease vs Anemia.Importance: Pregnancy in sickle cell disease (SCD) is high risk, but whether prenatal anemia, which is treatable with red blood cell transfusions, is a mediator associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs) is not known. Objective: To compare rates and odds of severe maternal morbidity (SMM) and other APOs in pregnancies among individuals with SCD vs those without SCD but with prenatal anemia. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study was conducted using data from 2012 to 2018 from the National Inpatient Sample, a nationally representative sample of 20% of acute hospital admissions in the United States. All admissions with codes for delivery of a pregnancy among people aged 11 to 55 years were included. Only admissions coded with Black race were included. Data were analyzed from September 2021 through August 2022. Exposures: Prenatal anemia and SCD. Main Outcomes and Measures: SMM was tabulated per the Center for Disease Control and Prevention SMM Index alongside other APOs. Multiple logistic regression was used to compare the odds for APOs and risk ratios (RRs) to compare rates of APOs. Results: Among 764 455 total delivery admissions among patients identified as Black (mean [SD] age at delivery, 27.00 [6.08] years), 3200 deliveries were coded with maternal SCD, 34 808 deliveries were coded with maternal anemia, and 726 447 deliveries were control. Most patients were publicly insured (499 060 [65.4%]). For most outcomes, including SMM and mortality per 10 000 deliveries, the SCD group had higher rates (SMM: 5.9%; 95% CI, 5.1%-6.8%; maternal mortality: 13.0 deaths; 95% CI, 4.9 to 35.0 deaths) than anemia (SMM: 2.1%; 95% CI, 2.0%-2.3%; maternal mortality: 0.9 deaths; 95% CI, 0.3 to 2.8 deaths) or control groups (SMM: 1.1%; 95% CI, 1.0%-1.1%; maternal mortality: 1.2 deaths; 95% CI, 1.0 to 1.5 deaths). SCD (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 5.51; 95% CI, 4.71-6.45) and anemia groups (aOR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.84-2.17) had higher adjusted odds of SMM compared with the control group. However, for many complications associated with ischemia or abnormal placentation, CIs of aORs for SCD and anemia groups overlapped (eg, eclampsia: aOR, 2.74; 95% CI, 1.51-4.96 vs aOR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.08-1.81). For these complications, RRs for SCD vs anemia were between 1.0 and 2.1 (eg, eclampsia: 1.76; 95% CI, 0.93-3.32). For complications associated with thrombosis or SCD-specific pathologies, rates and aORs were greater for the SCD vs anemia group. For these complications, RRs were between 3.70 and 10.90. For example, rates of acute respiratory distress syndrome, including acute chest syndrome, were 56 of 3144 deliveries (1.8%) vs 122 of 34 686 deliveries (0.4%), and the RR was 4.99 (95% CI, 3.65-6.84). Conclusions and Relevance: This study found that risks associated with prenatal anemia and SCD were similar for many APOs, especially those associated with ischemia and abnormal placentation, suggesting that prenatal anemia may be a mediator associated with pregnancy risk in individuals with SCD.
36775794		Complementary and alternative medicine for children with sickle cell disease: A systematic review.BACKGROUND: Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is a popular alternative to opioid and other analgesics in sickle cell disease (SCD). We review the effectiveness, prevalence, and factors associated with CAM use in the pediatric SCD population. METHODS: The review protocol was created based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. A literature search was conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Web of Science. RESULTS: Twenty-four studies were examined. The prevalence of CAM use in pediatric patients with SCD ranged from 36 to 84.5%. Common inpatient CAM interventions were yoga, virtual reality, and acupuncture, which decreased pain scale scores. Outpatient CAMs were consisted of cognitive behavioral therapy, massage therapy, and guided-imagery, which increased pain tolerability and decreased pain scale scores. CONCLUSIONS: CAM modalities can decrease pain scale scores. However, the impact of specific CAM modalities on emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and school absences were inconclusive.

36377997	associate|@GENE_DHCR24|@GENE_RHD	The Frequencies of ABO and Rh Phenotypes among Male Blood Donors in Northwestern Saudi Arabia.BACKGROUND: Transfusion-dependent patients in Saudi Arabia are numerous because of the existence of life-threatening inherited diseases such as sickle cell anemia and thalassemia. Thus, analysis of the frequencies of the ABO and rhesus (Rh) phenotypes is vital. This study sought to evaluate the frequencies of the ABO and Rh phenotypes among male blood donors in Hail region. METHODS: One hundred and twenty-six (126) blood samples were collected from male donors living in Hail region and were screened for ABO and Rh phenotypes. The collected data were statistically analyzed using GraphPad Prism (version 9.3.1). RESULTS: Among 126 blood donors, 43.6% were classified into the O blood group. Additionally, Rh antigen e was predominantly detected in this study (99.2%). A total of 103 blood donors exhibited D antigen, whereas 23 were negative for D antigen. The DCe/dce (R1r) phenotype was observed in 29.1% of RhD positive donors, while 73.9% of RhD negative blood donors expressed the dce/dce (rr) phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: The O phenotype and e antigen were most frequently observed in male blood donors from Hail province. RhD positive samples took advantage of total blood donor samples over RhD negative samples. CcDee (R1r) phenotype was commonly identified in the RhD positive population, whereas ccddee (rr) phenotype was consis tently detected in the RhD negative male donors.
34795732	associate|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell|@GENE_TF ;associate|@CHEMICAL_Iron|@DISEASE_Hemolysis ;associate|@CHEMICAL_Iron|@GENE_TF	Burden of iron overload among non-chronically blood transfused preschool children with sickle cell anaemia.BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease is the commonest genetic disorder of haemoglobin due to inheritance of mutant haemoglobin genes from both parents. The disorder is characterized by chronic haemolysis which results in increased availability of iron from red blood cell destructions. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of iron overload among non-chronically blood transfused preschool children with sickle cell anaemia. METHODS: Serum ferritin was assayed and transferrin saturation derived in 97 steady state sickle cell anaemia children. Elevated iron stores were defined as serum ferritin level >300ng/ml, and transferrin saturation >45%. RESULTS: Serum ferritin level was greater than 300 mg/ml in 14 (14.4%) subjects and transferrin saturation >45% in six (6.2%) subjects with sickle cell anaemia. The prevalence of iron overload was 20.6%. The prevalence of iron overload was higher among subjects in older age group, female, with history of blood transfusion, and with single blood transfusion session. CONCLUSION: Iron overload is prevalent in older children; the number of blood transfusion sessions notwithstanding. Regular assessment of serum ferritin is recommended.
37772453		The association of sickle cell disorder with adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients: A meta-analysis.The aim is to elucidate the relationship between sickle cell disorder and severe COVID-19. We systematically searched the required articles in three electronic databases, extracting and pooling effect sizes (ES) and 95% confidence interval (CI) from each eligible study to evaluate the effect of combined sickle cell disorder on adverse consequences in patients with COVID-19. This meta-analysis included 21 studies. Sickle cell disease (SCD) was a risk factor for mortality (pooled ES = 1.70, 95% CI: 1.00-2.92, p = 0.001), hospitalization (pooled ES = 6.21, 95% CI: 3.60-10.70, p = 0.000) and intensive care unit (ICU) admission (pooled ES = 2.29, 95% CI: 1.61-3.24, p = 0.099) in COVID-19 patients. Patients with SCD had an increased risk of respiratory failure/mechanical ventilation, but a statistical association was not found (pooled ES = 1.21, 95%CI: 0.74-1.98, p = 0.036). There was significant heterogeneity between SCD and death, hospitalization, and respiratory failure/mechanical ventilation. The results of meta-regression of SCD and hospitalization suggested that the tested variables including Area (p = 0.642), study design (p = 0.739), sample size (p = 0.397), proportion of males (p = 0.708), effect type (p = 0.723), whether confounding factors are adjusted (p = 0.606) might not be the source of heterogeneity. In addition, sickle cell trait (SCT) was significantly associated with the mortality (pooled ES = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.28-1.85, p = 0.771) and hospitalization (pooled ES = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.07-1.35,p = 0.519) in patients with COVID-19. But any increased risk of ICU admission/severe (pooled ES = 1.24, 95% CI: 0.95-1.62, p = 0.520) and mechanical ventilation (OR = 1.00, 95%CI:0.59-1.69) in COVID-19 patients with SCT was not observed. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the results were robust. The results of the funnel plot and Egger's test did not support the existence of publication bias. Current meta-analysis indicated that sickle cell disorder has a meaningful impact on COVID-19 progression to severe cases and associated deaths. However, further investigations and research to validate the current findings is indispensable.
35548868	cause|@CHEMICAL_Acetazolamide|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell ;associate|@CHEMICAL_Oxygen|@DISEASE_Cerebral_Infarction	Assessment of functional shunting in patients with sickle cell disease.Silent cerebral infarcts (SCI) are common in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and are thought to be caused by a mismatch between oxygen delivery and consumption. Functional cerebrovascular shunting is defined as reduced oxygen offloading due to the rapid transit of blood through the capillaries caused by increased flow and has been suggested as a potential mechanism underlying reduced oxygenation and SCI. We investigated the venous arterial spin labeling signal (VS) in the sagittal sinus as a proxy biomarker of cerebral functional shunting, and its association with hemodynamic imaging and hematological laboratory parameters. We included 28 children and 38 adults with SCD, and ten healthy racematched adult controls. VS, cerebral blood flow (CBF), velocity in the brain feeding arteries, oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) were measured before and after acetazolamide administration. VS was higher in patients with SCD compared to controls (P<0.01) and was increased after acetazolamide administration in all groups (P<0.01). VS was primarily predicted by CBF (P<0.01), but CBF-corrected VS was also associated with decreased CMRO2 (P<0.01). Additionally, higher disease severity defined by low hemoglobin and increased hemolysis was associated with higher CBF-corrected VS. Finally, CMRO2 was negatively correlated with fetal hemoglobin, and positively correlated with lactate dehydrogenase, which could be explained by changes in oxygen affinity. These findings provide evidence for cerebral functional shunting and encourage future studies investigating the potential link to aberrant capillary exchange in SCD.
34714833		Sex-based differences in the manifestations and complications of sickle cell disease: Report from the Sickle Cell Disease Implementation Consortium.INTRODUCTION: Sex-based clinical outcome differences in sickle cell disease (SCD) remain largely unknown despite evidence that female sex is associated with an increased lifespan. To better characterize sex-based differences in SCD, we assessed pain, treatment characteristics, laboratory measures and complications among males and females currently enrolled in the Sickle Cell Disease Implementation Consortium (SCDIC) registry. METHODS: The SCDIC consists of eight comprehensive SCD centers and one data coordinating center that received funding from the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute to improve outcomes for individuals with SCD. Eligibility criteria included: 15 to 45 years of age and a confirmed diagnosis of SCD. Self-report surveys were completed and data were also abstracted from the participants' medical records. RESULTS: A total of 2,124 participants were included (mean age: 27.8 years; 56% female). The majority had hemoglobin SS SCD genotype. Females had worse reports of pain severity (mean (SD) T-score 51.6 (9.6) vs 49.3 (10), p<0.001), more vaso-occlusive episodes (p = 0.01) and a higher occurrence of 3 or more hospital admissions in the past year (30.9% vs. 25.5, p = 0.03). On multivariable analysis, males had higher odds of acute chest syndrome (odds ratio (OR) 1.4, p = 0.002), cardiovascular (OR 1.70, p<0.001) and musculoskeletal (OR 1.33, p = 0.0034) complications and lower odds of depression (OR 0.77, p = 0.0381). Females had higher fetal hemoglobin levels with and without hydroxyurea use (9.6% vs 8.5%, p = 0.03 and 3% vs 2.2%, p = 0.0005, respectively). CONCLUSION: Our data suggests that sex differences in clinical outcomes do occur among individuals with SCD. Future research needs to explore the mechanisms underlying these differences.
36931493		Factors Affecting Age of Initial Specialty Clinic Evaluation Among Infants with Sickle Cell Disease in Kingston, Jamaica.OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of newborn screening for sickle cell disease in eastern Jamaica by determining what proportion of screen-positive infants were registered with the Sickle Cell Unit (SCU) by two months (60 days) of age and identifying parents' perceptions of facilitators and barriers impacting age at registration. STUDY DESIGN: This cross-sectional study used a mixed method approach. Ages at diagnosis confirmation and first clinic visit were recorded for screen-positive infants born between February 1, 2015, and November 15, 2017. All parents were invited to complete the survey and early and late attendees were invited to participate in the qualitative aspect of the study. A researcher-designed questionnaire and an interview guide based on the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation, Behavior (COM-B), and Health Belief Models examined factors that may affect time to registration. Quantitative data were analyzed to yield descriptive statistics using Stata v14. All interview data were coded. Similar codes were grouped together into themes. RESULTS: Most (97.7%) of the 133 screen-positive infants had their diagnosis confirmed. Only 40% had their first clinic visit by age 60 days. Denial of the diagnosis, poor communication, and the costs of treatment and transportation were perceived barriers to registration, whereas family support was a facilitator. CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosis confirmation was almost universal, but most infants did not attend clinic by two months of age. In-depth interviews have identified several facilitators and barriers that can be targeted to improve early registration.
35737751	treat|@CHEMICAL_plerixafor|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell	Optimizing haematopoietic stem and progenitor cell apheresis collection from plerixafor-mobilized patients with sickle cell disease.We adjusted haematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) apheresis collection from patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) by targeting deep buffy coat collection using medium or low collection preference (CP), and by increasing anticoagulant-citrate-dextrose-solution A dosage. In 43 HSPC collections from plerixafor-mobilized adult patients with SCD, we increased the collection efficiency to 35.79% using medium CP and 82.23% using low CP. Deep buffy coat collection increased red blood cell contamination of the HSPC product, the product haematocrit was 4.7% with medium CP and 6.4% with low CP. These adjustments were well-tolerated and allowed efficient HSPC collection from SCD patients.
36541410		Maternal morbidity and mortality associated with mode of delivery in sickle cell disease.This retrospective observational study compared pregnancy outcomes based on mode of delivery in women with homozygous sickle cell disease (HbSS) to women without (HbAA) using delivery records of 48,600 parturients between January 1992 and January 2020. Fisher's exact tests and Mann-Whitney's test were used to analyse variables based on sickle cell status. Vaginal delivery and HbSS were more associated with labour induction/augmentation (AOR = 2.4, (0.7-7.8)), intrapartum complications (AOR = 2.6, (0.5-14)), postpartum haemorrhage (AOR = 2.8 (0.5-15.2)) and postpartum infections (AOR = 9.6 (1.7-54.4)). Caesarean delivery resulted in more postpartum infections in the HbSS group (AOR = 23.6 (0.9-638.4)). Vaginal delivery in HbSS resulted in more intrapartum complications and postpartum haemorrhage but caesarean delivery greatly increased the risk of postpartum infections and hypertensive disorders. Sickle cell disease (SCD) did not confer increased risk of adverse perinatal outcomes regardless of mode of delivery.Impact StatementWhat is already known on this subject? Women with homozygous sickle cell disease (SCD) are at an increased risk of postpartum infections, undergoing caesarean delivery, admission to the neonatal intensive care unit and overall perinatal mortality when compared to women with normal haemoglobin genotype. Comparisons have been made between homozygous SS disease and haemoglobin SC disease revealing higher rates of maternal and foetal morbidity in both groups.What do the results of this study add? Studies comparing maternal and foetal morbidity based on mode of delivery are lacking. To our knowledge, this study is the first examine maternal and perinatal outcomes in women with SCD undergoing vaginal and abdominal delivery compared to women with normal haemoglobin. We found that vaginal delivery in SCD is associated with more postpartum haemorrhage and caesarean delivery was linked to more hypertensive disorders and postpartum infections then compared to women with normal haemoglobin. Converse to other reports, there was no difference in perinatal outcomes based on mode of delivery.What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? Caesarean delivery and SCD greatly increased the risk of postpartum infections and hypertensive disorders but did not confer a higher risk of postpartum haemorrhage. There were more maternal deaths in SCD women who underwent caesarean vs. vaginal delivery and this requires further study to determine the pregestational predictors of adverse outcomes. Women with SCD who achieve a successful primary vaginal delivery may have reduced risk of complications in subsequent pregnancies, possibly comparable to women without the disease.
38265872		Sexual Maturation of Female Adolescent Patients with Sickle Cell Anaemia in Lagos, Nigeria.BACKGROUND: Sickle cell anaemia (SCA) has been shown to have adverse effects on growth and sexual development. Recent Nigerian studies have reported a declining trend in the age of sexual maturation and menarche in haemoglobin AA (HbAA) individuals. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the sexual maturation of female patients with SCA aged 10 to 19 years seen at Lagos University Teaching Hospital Idi-Araba, Lagos and Sickle Cell Foundation. METHODS: It was a cross-sectional study involving 140 girls with SCA (subjects) and an equal number of girls with HbAA (controls) who were matched for age and socio-economic class over a fivemonth period. The evaluation involved anthropometry, calculation of BMI and determination of breast and pubic hair development using Tanner staging. RESULTS: The mean BMI for the subjects was 17.2+-2.39 kg/m2and 20.2+-3.09 kg/m2 for the controls (p < 0.001). The mean age at onset of breast development (B2) was 13 +- 0.39 years in the subjects and 10.5 +- 0.51 years in the controls (p < 0.001). The corresponding mean age for pubic hair development (PH2) was also higher at 13.8 +- 0.59 years for the girls with SCA and 10.4 +- 0.51 years for the controls (p <0.001), while menarche was achieved in the subjects at 14.7 +- 1.68 years and in the controls at 12.3 +- 1.33 years (p < 0.001). Upper socioeconomic class was associated with earlier menarche and faster transition from pre-pubertal stage to pubertal stage of sexual maturation in the controls but was not observed in the SCA subjects. CONCLUSION: Sexual maturity in patients with SCA lagged behind those of the HbAA controls.
36890729	treat|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Thalassemia ;treat|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell	Longitudinal effect of disease-modifying therapy on left ventricular diastolic function in children with sickle cell anemia.Cardiac abnormalities seen in sickle cell anemia (SCA) include diastolic dysfunction, which has been shown to be associated with high morbidity and early mortality. The effect of disease-modifying therapies (DMT) on diastolic dysfunction is poorly understood. We prospectively evaluated the effects of hydroxyurea and monthly erythrocyte transfusions on diastolic function parameters over 2 years. A total of 204 subjects with HbSS or HbSbeta0-thalassemia (mean age 11 +- 3.7 years), unselected for disease severity, had diastolic function assessed with surveillance echocardiograms twice, 2 years apart. During this 2-year observation period, 112 participants received DMTs (hydroxyurea, n = 72, monthly erythrocyte transfusions, n = 40), 34 initiated hydroxyurea, and 58 did not receive any DMT. The entire cohort showed an increase in left atrial volume index (LAVi) of 3.40 +- 10.86 mL/m2, p = .001 over 2 years. This increase in LAVi was independently associated with anemia, high baseline E/e' or LV dilation. Individuals not exposed to DMT were younger (mean age 8.8 +- 2.9 years), but at baseline their prevalence of abnormal diastolic parameters was similar to that of the DMT-exposed participants who were older (mean age 12 +- 3.8 years). Participants on DMTs saw no improvement in diastolic function over the study period. In fact, participants on hydroxyurea saw a possible worsening in diastolic parameters (14% increase in LAVi and ~5% decrease in septal e') but also a ~9% decrease in fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels. Further studies are needed to evaluate if exposure to DMT for a longer duration or achieving higher HbF might be beneficial in alleviating diastolic dysfunction.
37438880	cause|@CHEMICAL_Iron|@DISEASE_Liver_Cirrhosis ;cause|@CHEMICAL_Bilirubin|@DISEASE_Liver_Cirrhosis	Predisposing factors for advanced liver fibrosis in patients with sickle cell disease.Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the most common monogenic disorders worldwide and liver complications are common in this group of patients. Our study aims to highlight the prevalence of chronic liver complications and the main predisposing factors for advanced liver fibrosis in SCD patients. For this purpose, 219 patients from eight Thalassemia and Sickle Cell Units across Greece enrolled in our study and history of liver related disease complications was recorded, as well as a full laboratory and imaging analysis concerning their liver function. 13.6% of the patients had advanced liver fibrosis. The presence of liver fibrosis was significantly correlated with advanced age, male gender, cholelithiasis and higher LDH, gamma-GT, INR, direct and indirect bilirubin levels. These patients had exhibited significantly more episodes of liver crises and acute intrahepatic cholestasis. No correlation was observed with right heart failure or previous viral hepatitis. Patients with advanced liver fibrosis were receiving a more intensive transfusion therapy for a longer period of time and had higher Liver Iron Concentration levels. Our study shows that liver complications and cirrhosis is a significant cause of morbidity in patients with SCD and it is primarily associated with intravascular hemolysis and vaso-occlusive phenomena and secondarily with iron overload.
34213480	treat|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell	Perception to hydroxyurea therapy in patients with sickle cell disease: Report from 3 centers.Background: Hydroxyurea (HU) is an hemoglobin F inducing agent used in the treatment of sickle cell disease (SCD). Aim: The aim of this study is to determine the perception of HU by people living with SCD. Materials and Methods: A pretested questionnaire was self-administered to known cases of SCD attending pediatrics and adult hematology clinics in three participating centers. Mothers of children <18 years responded on their behalf. Results: There were 101 responders, 49 (48.5%) males and 52 (51.5%) females, of which 24 (23.8%) were children <18 years and 77 (76.2%) were adults. The majority (n = 73, 72.3%) knew their phenotype. Up to 63 (62.4%) had crises in the past 3 months. Only 35 (34.7%) had heard of HU, many through their doctor (n = 16, 45.7%), 8 (22.9%) through online resources, and 7 (20%) from friends. Only 12 (11.9%) had been exposed to HU therapy, of which 5 (41.7%) had discontinued therapy mostly due to side effects (n = 2, 40%). The seven patients (58.3%) on continuous HU therapy for a duration of 6 months to over 5 years, all reported reduced hospital admissions and frequency of crises as benefits of the drug, whereas 4 (57.1%) had stopped requiring blood transfusion since starting therapy. Of those who had never taken HU, 53 (52.5%) believed that HU should be used in treating SCD and majority (n = 32, 60.4%) would want to be commenced on the drug. However, 8 (15.1%) would decline therapy (mostly due to perceived associated side effects; n = 4; 50%). Six (11.3%) were unsure if they would want the drug and 7 (13.2%) would have to discuss the decision first with their family. There were 8 (8.9%) responders who did not think HU will be beneficial in SCD and would decline treatment, while 26 (29.2%) were unsure of both the benefits of the drug or of commencing therapy. Conclusion: The findings from this study suggest that HU is beneficial for patients with SCD; however, the awareness of this medication among SCD patients is still low in our environment. Some SCD patients would decline the use of HU due to perceived side effects. We recommend that more awareness on HU be created and coordinated multi-center studies on the efficacy of HU in the Nigerian population be carried out.
34549417		Heart rate variability associated with acute exercise challenge in children with sickle cell anaemia.We examined heart rate variability (HRV) during exercise testing in 20 children with sickle cell anaemia (SCA) and 12 controls. Subjects achieved lower median HRV at peak exercise [standard deviation of R-wave to R-wave intervals (SDNN), 2 3 vs 2 9 ms, P = 0 027; logarithmic transformation of high frequency power (lnHF), 0 9 vs 1 3 ln(ms2 ), P = 0 047] and had lower post-exercise HRV across minute-by-minute analysis of recovery. After adjustment for haemoglobin, fitness and SCA status, subjects had lower HRV at the end of recovery with differences increasing as baseline HRV increased. Further investigation of HRV and exercise safety in SCA is warranted.
38138299		Pain Control for Sickle Cell Crisis, a Novel Approach? A Retrospective Study.Background and Objectives: Pain management poses a significant challenge for patients experiencing vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) in sickle cell disease (SCD). While opioid therapy is highly effective, its efficacy can be impeded by undesirable side effects. Local regional anesthesia (LRA), involving the deposition of a perineural anesthetic, provides a nociceptive blockade, local vasodilation and reduces the inflammatory response. However, the effectiveness of this therapeutic approach for VOC in SCD patients has been rarely reported up to now. The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a single-shot local regional anesthesia (LRA) in reducing pain and consequently enhancing the management of severe vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) in adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) unresponsive to conventional analgesic therapy. Materials and Methods: We first collected consecutive episodes of VOC in critical care (ICU and emergency room) for six months in 2022 in a French University hospital with a large population of sickle cell patients in the West Indies population. We also performed a systematic review of the use of LRA in SCD. The primary outcome was defined using a numeric pain score (NPS) and/or percentage of change in opioid use. Results: We enrolled nine SCD adults (28 years old, 4 females) for ten episodes of VOC in whom LRA was used for pain management. Opioid reduction within the first 24 h post block was -75% (50 to 96%). Similarly, the NPS decreased from 9/10 pre-block to 0-1/10 post-block. Five studies, including one case series with three patients and four case reports, employed peripheral nerve blocks for regional anesthesia. In general, local regional anesthesia (LRA) exhibited a reduction in pain and symptoms, along with a decrease in opioid consumption post-procedure. Conclusions: LRA improves pain scores, reduces opioid consumption in SCD patients with refractory pain, and may mitigate opioid-related side effects while facilitating the transition to oral analgesics. Furthermore, LRA is a safe and effective procedure.
37249608		Timing matters: An analysis of the relationship between red cell transfusion timing and hospitalization outcomes in sickle cell crisis patients using the National Inpatient Sample database.Vaso-occlusive pain crisis is a debilitating complication of sickle cell disease (SCD) and it is the most common cause of hospitalization among these individuals. We studied the inpatient outcomes among patients admitted with sickle cell crisis based on the timing of red blood cell transfusion. In this retrospective study, we used the United States National Inpatient Sample (NIS) data for the year 2019, to identify adult patients hospitalized with the principal diagnosis of sickle cell crisis who received simple red blood cell transfusion during their hospitalization. Patients were divided into two groups. Those who received simple red cell transfusion within 24 hours of admission were classified as early transfusion. After adjusting for confounders, the mean adjusted length of stay for patients with early transfusion was significantly lower than those who received a late blood transfusion by 3.51 days (p-value < 0.001) along with a decrease in mean adjusted hospitalization charges and cost, by 25,487 and 4,505 United States Dollar (USD) respectively. The early red cell transfusion was also associated with a decrease in inpatient mortality, demonstrated by an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 0.19 (p-value 0.036), and a reduction in in-hospital sepsis, with an aOR of 0.28 (p-value < 0.001), however, no statistically significant difference was found between the two groups regarding acute respiratory failure requiring intubation, vasopressors requirement, acute kidney injury requiring dialysis and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. We recommend timely triage and reassessment to identify sickle cell crisis patients requiring blood transfusion. This intervention can notably affect the inpatient length of stay, resource utilization, and hospitalization outcomes.
34855316		Hepatobiliary Findings in Nigerian Children with Sickle Cell Anaemia.INTRODUCTION: Hepatobiliary abnormalities occur commonly in sickle cell anaemia and these have been extensively reported in the adult patients. However, complications have been sparsely reported in children especially in the sub-Saharan African continent. This study aimed to highlight the hepatobiliary complications in this group of children using clinical examination, laboratory testing and abdominal ultrasonography. The challenges in a resource limited country are also highlighted. SUBJECTS, MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and thirty- four (134) children aged 1-18years with sickle cell anaemia in steady state were recruited into this crossectional study. Clinical history and physical examination obtained were documented. Relevant basic haematologic and biochemical indices (Full blood count, liver enzymes and viral markers for hepatitis B and C) and abdominal ultrasonographic parameters were documented for all the children. The relationship between the complications and possible risk factors (age, frequency of crisis and blood transfusions) were also documented. RESULT: Fifty-three (39.6%) of the children had hepatobiliary abnormalities. Chronic hepatitis B infection was the most prevalent complication (14.9%) seen followed by cholelithiasis (12.7%) and Hepatitis C infection (4.5%). Other complications identified were cholecystitis (3.0%), biliary sludge (1.5%), liver cirrhosis (0.7%). Age was significantly associated with viral hepatitis (p=0.003) and cholelithiasis (p=0.0007) and the conditions were more prevalent in the older age group. The hepatobilary complications were also more prevalent in the males. Frequent blood transfusions was significantly related to viral hepatitis (p=0.03). The use of hydroxyurea was not significantly related to any of the complications. CONCLUSION: Hepatobiliary abnormalities are prevalent in children with sickle cell anaemia. Clinical screening and the use of ultrasonography would aid early diagnosis and appropriate therapeutic intervention in this group of children.
34334096		Total Annual Economic Burden of Patients with Sickle Cell Disease in Steady State in Greece.Sickle cell disease includes a group of congenital hemolytic anemias, all characterized by the predominance of Hb S (HBB: c.20A>T). The population movement due to economic migration or escape from conflict zones will further affect the health systems of countries by either increasing the number of patients or forcing countries to create care units for sickle cell disease patients. This will probably also increase the incidence of the disease in areas where their incidence and prevalence were previously low. In the present study, an attempt has been made to estimate the total annual cost of the treatment of sickle cell disease in Greece. This was the first attempt to calculate the total annual cost of treating sickle cell disease patients in a steady state. The annual cost of sickle cell disease was estimated to be $21,152,340.00 (US$25,219,300.41), without calculating the cost of hospitalization for severe complications. Since 2013, in Greece, a pharmaceutical expenditure limit (decreasing with the years) has been budgeted at $1,945,000,000.00 (US$2,318,965,150.00), annually. It is therefore calculated that approximately 1.0% of the budget allocated to pharmaceutical spending is used to treat patients with sickle cell disease.
35319606		Exercise Testing In Patients with Sickle Cell Disease: Safety, Feasibility and Potential Prognostic Implication.BACKGROUND: Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) are at increased risk for cardiovascular complications. Exercise testing is used as a prognostic marker in a variety of cardiovascular diseases. However, there is a lack of evidence on exercise in SCD patients, particularly regarding its safety, feasibility, and possible prognostic role. OBJECTIVES: We used the maximal treadmill test to determine safety and feasibility of the exercise testing in SCD patients. Additionally, the factors associated with exercise duration, as well as the impact of exercise-induced changes on clinical outcome, were also assessed. METHODS: One-hundred thirteen patients with SCD, who underwent exercise testing, were prospectively enrolled. A comprehensive cardiovascular evaluation, including echocardiography and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels, were obtained. The long-term outcome was a composite endpoint of death, severe acute painful episodes, acute chest syndrome, or hospitalization for other SCD-related complications. Cox regression analysis was performed to identify the variables associated with the outcome. A p-value<0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. RESULTS: The mean age was 36 +- 12 years (range, 18-65 years), and 62 patients were women (52%). Ischemic electrocardiogram and abnormal blood pressure (BP) response to exercise were detected in 17% and 9%, respectively. Two patients experienced pain crises within 48 hours that required hospitalization. Factors associated with exercise duration were age, sex, tricuspid regurgitation (TR) maximal velocity, and E/e' ratio, after adjustment for markers of disease severity. During the mean follow-up of 10.1 months (ranging from 1.2 to 26), the endpoint was reached in 27 patients (23%). Independent predictors of adverse events were hemoglobin concentration, late transmitral flow velocity (A wave), and BP response to exercise. CONCLUSIONS: Exercise testing in SCD patients who were clinically stable is feasible. Exercise duration was associated with diastolic function and pulmonary artery pressure. Abnormal BP response was an independent predictor of adverse events.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the existence of an association between the clinical severity of sickle cell disease and platelet count in the steady state phase in patients with sickle cell disease followed up at the Center for Research and Control of Sickle Cell Disease in Bamako, Mali. We conducted a retrospective review of 40 medical records of patients aged 5 to 42 years with sickle cell disease at the Center for Research and Control of Sickle Cell Disease in Bamako, Mali. Clinical severity of sickle cell disease was assessed according to the criteria of VOC and/or hospitalizations < 2 or >= 2 per year. Data entry was carried out using the Excel 2013 version. The statistical tests used were the Chi2, Student and Mac Nemar tests. Of the 40 patients, 82.5% had haemolytic phenotype and 17.5% hyperviscous phenotype; complications of sickle cell disease were more frequent in the haemolytic phenotype group (p < 0.05). There was a significant association between mean platelet count >= 450 G/L in the steady state phase and the annual number of CVOs >= 2 (p = 0.002). This study shows that mean platelet count >= 450 G/L in sickle cell patients in the steady state phase could be a risk factor for the frequent occurrence of CVO. It underlines the importance of conducting prospective studies focusing on both hyperplateletosis and platelet activation markers in larger sample sizes, as well as therapeutic trials involving platelet activation inhibitors, such as Crizanlizumab, a humanised anti-P-selectin monoclonal antibodies.
33889266		Emergency department utilization for sickle cell disease in St. Vincent and the Grenadines.INTRODUCTION: sickle cell disease (SCD) is a chronic illness. Individuals affected by this disease are at risk for lifelong complications including episodes of acute pain, chronic pain and multi-organ injury that leads to reduced quality of life and a shortened life span. There is a wealth of data on acute care utilization for SCD in the United States. However, data from the Caribbean region is limited. The objective of this study is to explore Emergency Department (ED) utilization for SCD in St. Vincent and the Grenadines by describing: i) the characteristics of SCD related ED encounters; ii) the urgency of these encounters as defined by resource utilization; iii) the disposition for these ED encounters. METHODS: the study was a cross-sectional study utilizing data from the ED log books at the Milton Cato Memorial Hospital (MCMH) during non-consecutive time periods between January 1st, 2012 - December 31st, 2016. RESULTS: there were 666 SCD-related ED encounters during the study period. Thirty-four percent of encounters resulted in hospitalization and 66% of encounters met criteria for an urgent visit. The most commonly reported diagnosis was vaso-occlusive crisis and accounted for 84% of all encounters. The most frequently documented age group was the 18-30 age category at 43%. CONCLUSION: although SCD comprised less than 2% of all ED visits, the majority of these visits could be classified as urgent visits based on resource utilization. This study adds to the emerging data on the burden of this disease in this St. Vincent and the Grenadines.
37055588		A Pharmacometrics Model to Characterize a New Type of Target-Mediated Drug Disposition (TMDD) - Nonlinear Pharmacokinetics of Small-Molecule PF-07059013 Mediated By Its High-capacity Pharmacological Target Hemoglobin With Positive Cooperative Binding.In general, small-molecule target-mediated drug disposition (TMDD) is caused by the interaction of a drug with its high-affinity, low-capacity pharmacological target. In the current work, we developed a pharmacometrics model to characterize a new type of TMDD, where the nonlinear pharmacokinetics (PK) is mediated by a high-capacity pharmacological target with cooperative binding instead of target saturation. The model drug we used was PF-07059013, a noncovalent hemoglobin modulator that demonstrated promising preclinical efficacy to treat sickle cell disease (SCD), and showed complex nonlinear PK in mice with the fraction of unbound drug in blood (fub) decreased with an increase in PF-07059013 concentrations/doses due to the positive cooperative binding of PF-07059013 to hemoglobin. Among the various models we evaluated, the best one is a semi-mechanistic model where only drug molecules not bound to hemoglobin were allowed for elimination, with the nonlinear pharmacokinetics being captured by incorporating cooperative binding for drug molecules bound to hemoglobin. Our final model provided valuable insight on target binding-related parameters, such as the Hill coefficient gamma (estimated to be 1.6), binding constant KH (estimated to be 1450 microM), and the amount of total hemoglobin Rtot (estimated to be 2.13 micromol). As the dose selection of a compound with positive cooperative binding is tricky and challenging due to the nonproportional and steep response, our model may be valuable in facilitating the rational dose regimen selection for future preclinical animal and clinical trials for PF-07059013 and other compounds whose nonlinear pharmacokinetics are caused by similar mechanisms.

Failure to effectively control pain remains a challenge in patient care. Materials & methods: The authors conducted a cross-sectional study to determine the effect of CYP2D6 and UGT2B7 polymorphisms on pain management in 106 Zimbabwean SCD patients. Participant information was collected on a questionnaire. Genotyping was conducted using the GenoPharm  pharmacogenomics open array panel containing CYP2D6 and UGT genetic variants implicated in opioid response. Results: The reduced function alleles CYP2D6*17 and *29 had high frequencies of 15.9% and 12.9%, respectively. UGT2B7 rs73823859 showed a statistically significant correlation with pain levels (p = 0.0454). Conclusion: This study demonstrated the role of UGT2B7 polymorphism in SCD patient pain management.

This study aims to evaluate the clinical and epidemiological features and therapeutic options of AVN in sickle cell patients in Qatar. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on a 49 SCD patients who were diagnosed with AVN and attended the hematology clinic at the National Center for Cancer care & research, Hamad Medical Corporation, Qatar between Jan-2011 to Jan2021.  Results: Forty-nine adult patients with SCD who were diagnosed with AVN were studied. The median age of the study population is 32 years, and the median age at the first AVN diagnosis was 26 years (range: 11-44 yr.). 37 (75.5%) patients suffered from multiple joints AVN while 12(24.5%) had single joint involvement. 31 (63.3%) patients had bilateral hip AVN and 18 (36.7%) had shoulder involvement. 30 patients (61%) were on Hydroxyurea treatment. Based on FICAT and Alert classification of AVN, 57 % of patients had stage III and above at first diagnosis. 20 (40.8%) were managed with a conservative approach, 11 (22.4%) received hyperbaric oxygen with good response, 6(12.2%) underwent hip core decompression and 12(24.5%) underwent hip replacement surgery. CONCLUSION: In SCD patients, AVN occurred more during the 3rd and 4th decades of life. The majority of AVN represented with advanced stage and had multiple joint involvements. We recommend adopting a low threshold of joint imaging for early detection and prevention of further complications.
36308736		Role of regional anesthesia in patients with acute sickle cell pain: A scoping review.Sickle cell disease is the most prevalent inherited blood disorder in the world, with significant morbidity and mortality. Patients often have recurrent painful vaso-occlusive episodes, and the American Society of Hematology gives a conditional recommendation for the use of regional anesthesia for acute sickle cell pain management. This scoping review summarizes the current evidence and identifies gaps for future research. Our screening process is outlined, and articles that mentioned the use of regional anesthesia for acute sickle cell crises were included. We present and interpret our results and highlight opportunities for future investigation.
36669729		Sickle Cell Trevor Thompson Transition Project (ST3P-UP) protocol for managing care transitions: Methods and rationale.BACKGROUND: Emerging adults with sickle cell disease (EASCD) experience significant challenges transitioning from pediatric to adult care. Acute care utilization increases, quality of life (QOL) declines, with an increased risk of mortality. Currently, there are no practice standards to guide emerging adults through the transition process. We are creating a structured transition education (STE) based program for EASCD by customizing the Six Core Elements (6 CE) of Health Care Transition model and are evaluating the effectiveness of adding peer mentoring (PM). METHODS: The Sickle Cell Trevor Thompson Transition Project (ST3P-UP) is an ongoing multi-site, cluster randomized clinical trial with a target enrollment of 537 EASCD aged 16 to 25 years in pediatric care. Each site (n = 14) comprises a pediatric clinic, adult clinic, and a sickle cell disease (SCD) community-based organization (CBO). Sites are randomized 1:1 to either STE or STE + PM. EASCDs are followed prospectively for 24 months. Rapid cycle plan-do-study-act quality improvement (QI) methods are used to implement the STE. The primary objective is to compare the effectiveness of STE + PM versus STE only at decreasing the number of acute care visits per year over 24 months. The secondary objectives are to compare overall healthcare utilization and patient-reported QOL outcomes at 24 months. CONCLUSION: We aim to demonstrate the feasibility of using a QI approach to implement 6 CE-based practice standards at 14 disparate SCD clinical programs to guide EASCD through the transition process. We hypothesize that adding PM to the STE program will improve acute care reliance, QOL, and satisfaction with transition outcomes.

Chemoprevention regimens vary between countries, and the comparative efficacy of prevention regimens is largely unknown. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We enrolled Kenyan children aged 1 to 10 years with homozygous hemoglobin S (HbSS) in a randomized, open-label trial conducted between January 23, 2018, and December 15, 2020, in Homa Bay, Kenya. Children were assigned 1:1:1 to daily Proguanil (the standard of care), monthly sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine-amodiaquine (SP-AQ), or monthly dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) and followed monthly for 12 months. The primary outcome was the cumulative incidence of clinical malaria at 12 months, and the main secondary outcome was the cumulative incidence of painful events by self-report. Secondary outcomes included other parasitologic, hematologic, and general events. Negative binomial models were used to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) per patient-year (PPY) at risk relative to Proguanil. The primary analytic population was the As-Treated population. A total of 246 children were randomized to daily Proguanil (n = 81), monthly SP-AQ (n = 83), or monthly DP (n = 82). Overall, 53.3% (n = 131) were boys and the mean age was 4.6 +- 2.5 years. The clinical malaria incidence was 0.04 episodes/PPY; relative to the daily Proguanil group, incidence rates were not significantly different in the monthly SP-AQ (IRR: 3.05, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.36 to 26.14; p = 0.39) and DP (IRR: 1.36, 95% CI: 0.21 to 8.85; p = 0.90) groups. Among secondary outcomes, relative to the daily Proguanil group, the incidence of painful events was not significantly different in the monthly SP-AQ and DP groups, while monthly DP was associated with a reduced rate of dactylitis (IRR: 0.47; 95% CI: 0.23 to 0.96; p = 0.038). The incidence of Plasmodium falciparum infection relative to daily Proguanil was similar in the monthly SP-AQ group (IRR 0.46; 95% CI: 0.17 to 1.20; p = 0.13) but reduced with monthly DP (IRR 0.21; 95% CI: 0.08 to 0.56; p = 0.002). Serious adverse events were common and distributed between groups, although compared to daily Proguanil (n = 2), more children died receiving monthly SP-AQ (n = 7; hazard ratio [HR] 5.44; 95% CI: 0.92 to 32.11; p = 0.064) but not DP (n = 1; HR 0.61; 95% CI 0.04 to 9.22; p = 0.89), although differences did not reach statistical significance for either SP-AQ or DP. Study limitations include the unexpectedly limited transmission of P. falciparum in the study setting, the high use of hydroxyurea, and the enhanced supportive care for trial participants, which may limit generalizability to higher-transmission settings where routine sickle cell care is more limited. CONCLUSIONS: In this study with limited malaria transmission, malaria chemoprevention in Kenyan children with SCA with monthly SP-AQ or DP did not reduce clinical malaria, but DP was associated with reduced dactylitis and P. falciparum parasitization. Pragmatic studies of chemoprevention in higher malaria transmission settings are warranted. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03178643).

Because this alkylating agent is increasingly utilized as conditioning prior to gene therapy in nonmalignant hematologic and related disorders, more precise characterization of busulfan's potential contribution to subsequent malignant risk is warranted. PROCEDURE: We conducted a literature-based assessment of busulfan and subsequent late effects, with emphasis on secondary malignancies, identifying publications via PubMed searches, and selecting those reporting at least 3 years of follow-up. RESULTS: We identified eight pediatric and 13 adult publications describing long-term follow-up in 570 pediatric and 2076 adult hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients. Secondary malignancies were reported in 0.5% of pediatric HCT recipients, with no cases of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myelocytic leukemia (AML). Fatal secondary malignancies were reported in 0.8% of 1887 evaluable adult HCT recipients, and an overall incidence of secondary malignancies of 4.8% was reported in a subset of 389 evaluable adult patients. We also reviewed long-term results from eight publications evaluating lentiviral- and human promotor-based HSC-targeted gene therapy in 215 patients with nonmalignant conditions, in which busulfan/treosulfan monotherapy or busulfan/fludarabine was the only conditioning. Two malignancies were reported in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), one of which was potentially busulfan-related. No additional malignancies were reported in 173 patients with follow-up of 5-12 years. CONCLUSION: The incidence of busulfan-related secondary malignancies is low, and likely to be substantially less than 1% in pediatric transplant recipients, especially those receiving busulfan monotherapy for nonmalignant conditions other than SCD.

We demonstrate this approach by studying RBCs' elastic properties from deidentified sickle cell anemia (SCA) and sickle cell trait (SCT) blood samples. AIM: A laser trapping (LT) force was formulated and analytically calculated in a cylindrical model. Using this trapping force relative percent difference, the maximum (longitudinal) and minimum (transverse) radius rate and stiffness were used to study the elasticity. APPROACH: The elastic property of SCA and SCT RBCs was analyzed using LT technique with computer controlled piezo-driven stage, in order to trap and stretch the RBCs. RESULTS: For all parameters, the results show that the SCT RBC samples have higher elastic property than the SCA RBCs. The higher rigidity in the SCA cell may be due to the lipid composition of the membrane, which was affected by the cholesterol concentration. CONCLUSIONS: By developing a theoretical model for different trapping forces, we have also studied the elasticity of RBCs in SCT (with hemoglobin type HbAS) and in SCA (with hemoglobin type HbSS). The results for the quantities describing the elasticity of the cells consistently showed that the RBCs in the SCT display lower rigidity and higher deformability than the RBCs with SCA.
37060916		Alloimmunisation against red blood cells in sickle cell disease: transfusion challenges in high-income and low-income countries.Sickle cell disease is the most frequent inherited disorder in sub-Saharan Africa and in many high-income countries (HICs). Transfusion is a key element of treatment, but it results in high rates of alloimmunisation against red blood cell antigens and post-transfusion haemolysis, which can be life-threatening in severe cases. The prevention of alloimmunisation is, therefore, an important issue in both HICs and in low-income countries (LICs). In HICs, the main reason for high alloimmunisation rates is blood group disparity between blood donors, who are mostly of European descent, and the patients, who are mostly of African descent. However, alloimmunisation rates also remain high in sub-Saharan Africa despite the homogeneity of blood group antigen frequencies between donors and patients; this occurrence is probably due to matching strategies limited to ABO blood group and RhD. However, other possible underlying causes of alloimmunisation have also been suggested, with each cause affecting HICs and LICs in different ways-eg, the immunogenetic and inflammatory status of the patient and the characteristics of the red blood cell products. In this Viewpoint, we discuss the available data and hypotheses that potentially account for the association of sickle cell disease with high rates of alloimmunisation in both settings, HICs and LICs (focusing particularly on sub-Saharan Africa), and the challenges faced by HICs and LICs to improve prevention of alloimmunisation.

34280801		Postoperative respiratory complications after adenotonsillectomy in children with obstructive sleep apnea.OBJECTIVE: Children with obstructive sleep apnea are considered high risk for postoperative respiratory complications, but opinions differ regarding the polysomnography (PSG) criteria that suggest the need for postoperative admission. Our objective was to determine if otherwise healthy children age >=3 years with an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) < 24 on overnight PSG can be safely discharged on the same day of surgery. METHODS: Case series with chart review of children age <18 years with positive PSG (AHI > 2) who underwent adenotonsillectomy (T&A) between January 2013 and August 2019. Data collected included patient demographics, medical history, comorbidities, PSG results, operative details, length of stay, intraoperative and postoperative respiratory complications and management. Potential predictors of respiratory complications were evaluated using chi-square/Fisher's exact test and 2-tailed unpaired t tests with the Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparison artifact. The percentages of healthy children age >=3 years who were discharged on the day of surgery at various PSG cutoffs were calculated. RESULTS: Of the 560 children, mean (SD) age was 6.4 (3.7) years, 318 (56.8%) were male, 438 (78.2%) were African American, 243 (43.4%) were obese, 16 (2.9%) had Down Syndrome and 12 (2.1%) had sickle cell disease. Median (range) AHI was 12.3 (2-145). Fifteen children (2.7% [95% CI 1.3, 4.0]) had an intraoperative or postoperative respiratory complication. Minor complications including mild desaturation, stridor, croupy cough, and laryngospasm occurred in 9 patients and did not prolong the planned ambulatory or hospital stay. Of the 6 children with more severe complications including prolonged desaturation, tachypnea, atelectasis, intercostal retraction and obstructive apnea requiring continuous positive airway pressure, all were planned admissions based on age, severe sleep study indices (AHI >= 24 or oxygen saturation nadir < 80%) or underlying medical condition. Of the 165 children age >=3 without medical comorbidities known to be predictive of postoperative complications with an AHI >=10 but <24, 113 (68.5%) were discharged home on the same day of surgery without additional respiratory sequelae. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a low risk of respiratory complications after T&A. Otherwise healthy children age >=3 years with AHI <24 may be considered for ambulatory discharge.

To investigate human leukocyte antigen (HLA) sensitization, graft characteristics, donor chimerism, and immune reconstitution in these recipients. Methods: CD34 cells were enriched using the CliniMACS  system with a target dose of 10 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg with a peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMNC) addback dose of 2x105 CD3/kg in the final product. Pre-transplant HLA antibodies were characterized. Donor chimerism was monitored 1-24 months post-transplant. Comprehensive assessment of immune reconstitution included lymphocyte subsets, plasma cytokines, complement levels, anti-viral T-cell responses, activation markers, and cytokine production. Infections were monitored. Results: HLA antibodies were detected in 7 of 11 (64%) evaluable patients but rarely were against donor antigens. Myeloid engraftment was rapid (100%) at a median of 9 days. At 30 days, donor chimerism was 93-99% and natural killer cell levels were restored. By 60 days, CD19 B cells were normal. CD8 and CD4 T-cells levels were normal by 279 and 365 days, respectively. Activated CD4 and CD8 T-cells were elevated at 100-365 days post-transplant while naive cells remained below baseline. Tregs were elevated at 100-270 days post-transplant, returning to baseline levels at one year. At one year, C3 and C4 levels were above baseline and CH50 levels were near baseline. At one year, cytokine levels were not significantly different from baseline. Discussion: These results suggest that haploidentical transplantation with CD34-enriched cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cell addback results in rapid engraftment, sustained donor chimerism and broad-based immune reconstitution.

34047257	associate|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell|@GENE_HBB	Gene Therapy as the New Frontier for Sickle Cell Disease.Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is one of the most common monogenic disorders caused by a point mutation in the beta-globin gene. This mutation results in polymerization of hemoglobin (Hb) under reduced oxygenation conditions, causing rigid sickle-shaped RBCs and hemolytic anemia. This clearly defined fundamental molecular mechanism makes SCD a prototypical target for precision therapy. Both the mutant beta-globin protein and its downstream pathophysiology are pharmacological targets of intensive research. SCD also is a disease well-suited for biological interventions like gene therapy. Recent advances in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation and gene therapy platforms, like Lentiviral vectors and gene editing strategies, expand the potentially curative options for patients with SCD. This review discusses the recent advances in precision therapy for SCD and the preclinical and clinical advances in autologous HSC gene therapy for SCD.

36355034		Unique approaches for testicular shielding during total-body irradiation for pediatric patients.Total-body irradiation (TBI) has been used as a part of the conditioning regimen for patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for certain nonmalignant conditions such as sickle cell disease. Although effective, TBI can cause lasting side effects for pediatric patients. One of these potential side effects includes oligospermia or even permanent azoospermia. Although many investigators have studied ways to shield the testicles during the TBI for nonmalignant conditions, there is no set standard. We describe the technical aspects of effective techniques to shield the testicles of male pediatric patients undergoing TBI. We verified that our techniques reduced the testicular dose by approximately 80%-85% of the TBI prescription dose in four male pediatric patients, keeping the dose well below the documented doses that can cause permanent infertility and hypogonadism.
35724043		Gestion des crises vaso-occlusives par les patients atteints de drepanocytose.Introduction : Sickle cell disease, while it is the most common genetic disease in France, is little known to caregivers and the general public.Context : Only a few studies have examined the daily lives of people suffering from this disease.Objectives : The purpose of this project was to describe the specific strategies helping adult patients to manage the symptoms of their disease.Method : To reach this objective, a qualitative study was conducted among eight homozygous (SS) people over 30 years old living in the Ile-de-France region of France. The semi-structured interviews took place at the patients' homes, selected from several regional competence centers and on social media. An inductive methodology and a thematic analysis were used to draw the conclusions of this research.Results : They show that pain and suffering are patients' main complaints. Patients suffering from sickle cell disease seek numerous effective self-care strategies to manage their long-term pain : preventive measures and drugs, as well as complementary and alternative medicine.Discussion : A sociological approach shows us the considerable work that patients undertake to manage symptoms daily.Conclusion : The findings support interventions that would increase the feeling of control over the disease through better self-awareness and appropriate physical activity.

The mononuclear phagocyte system plays critical roles in SCA pathophysiology. However, how heterogeneous populations of hepatic macrophages contribute to SCA remains unclear. Using a combination of single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics via multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH), we identified distinct macrophage populations with diversified origins and biological functions in SCA mouse liver. We previously found that administering the von Willebrand factor (VWF)-cleaving protease ADAMTS13 alleviated vaso-occlusive episode in SCA mice. Here, we discovered that the ADAMTS13-cleaved VWF was cleared from the circulation by a Clec4f+Marcohigh macrophage subset in a desialylation-dependent manner in the liver. In addition, sickle erythrocytes were phagocytized predominantly by Clec4f+Marcohigh macrophages. Depletion of macrophages not only abolished the protective effect of ADAMTS13 but exacerbated vaso-occlusive episode in SCA mice. Furthermore, promoting macrophage-mediated VWF clearance reduced vaso-occlusion in SCA mice. Our study demonstrates that hepatic macrophages are important in the pathogenesis of SCA, and efficient clearance of VWF by hepatic macrophages is critical for the protective effect of ADAMTS13 in SCA mice.
34666680		coreSCD: multi-stakeholder consensus on core outcomes for sickle cell disease clinical trials.BACKGROUND: With the dramatic increase in the pipeline for new sickle cell disease (SCD) therapies in recent years, the time is ripe to ensure a robust body of evidence is available for decision making by regulators, payers, clinicians, and patients. Harmonization of the outcomes selected across interventional trials enables optimal post-trial appraisal and decision making through valid pooled analyses and indirect comparisons. We employed a structured, multi-stakeholder consensus process to develop core outcome sets (COS) for use in clinical trials of SCD interventions. METHODS: CoreSCD utilized a modified Delphi method adapted from the standards recommended by the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) Initiative. An initial list of candidate outcomes was developed through a targeted literature review and input from an 11-member advisory committee. A 44-member multi-stakeholder Delphi Panel was established and included patients and family members, advocates, clinicians, researchers, payers, health technology assessors, representatives from government agencies, and industry representatives. Patients/advocates comprised 25% of the Delphi Panel and orientation and training was provided prior to the consensus process to ensure all were prepared to participate meaningfully. Panelists completed three rounds of an online survey to rate the importance of candidate outcomes for inclusion in the COS. Summary data was provided between each voting round and an in-person consensus meeting was held between the second and third round of voting. Consensus rules were applied following each round of voting to eliminate outcomes that did not meet predetermined criteria for retention. RESULTS: Consensus was reached for two core outcome sets. The final COS for trials of disease-modifying therapies includes ten outcomes and the COS for trials of acute interventions includes six outcomes. Both core sets include clinical outcomes as well as outcomes related to functioning/quality of life, resource utilization, and survival/mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Use of the COS in clinical development programs for SCD will help to ensure that relevant, consistent outcomes are available for decision making across the product lifecycle.

The objective of this study was to investigate crizanlizumab population pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD), as well as influential covariates. METHODS: A population PK model for crizanlizumab was developed from healthy volunteer and SCD patient data, using a two-compartment intravenous infusion model utilizing a target-mediated drug disposition (TMDD) approach. The relationship between crizanlizumab concentration and ex vivo P-selectin inhibition was fitted to a non-linear sigmoidal Emax model. Covariate selection was performed in a stepwise manner. RESULTS: Crizanlizumab exhibits nonlinear pharmacokinetics in the wide dose range of 0.2-8 mg/kg body weight. The population pharmacokinetic base model incorporated body weight as covariate in the form of allometric scaling wherein the exponents were fixed to 0.8. SCD patients had higher baseline soluble P-selectin concentration, resulting in a higher estimated initial target concentration. The typical individual in the model is a 70 kg SCD patient with normal renal function and a baseline albumin of 43 g/L; CL was 0.012 L/h while Vss was 5.2 L. For the population PD model, none of the identified additional factors beyond PD assay and covariates, such as body weight at baseline nor patient type differences, led to relevant differences in P-selectin % inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: Renal and hepatic impairments, concomitant hydroxyurea usage, and presence of anti-drug antibody are not expected to impact the exposure of crizanlizumab. The model allows for extrapolating the PK of crizanlizumab to pediatric population and evaluation of alternative regimens and route of administration.

Pre-validated questionnaires were employed for data collection and statistical analysis was performed using the United States' Center for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) Epi Info 7.1.4 software. RESULTS: Only 172 (22%) and 96 (12.2%) of the mothers were aware of NBS and comprehensive care for babies with SCD respectively. The acceptance of NBS was high, 718 (92%) among the mothers. The reasons for acceptance of NBS were to know how to take care of the baby 416 (57.9%), know the genotype status 180 (25.1%) while the motivating factors for NBS were knowledge of benefits 455 (58%) and the cost is free 205 (26.1%). The majority of the mothers 561(71.6%) agree that SCD can be ameliorated by NBS while 80 (24.6%) do not know if it can. CONCLUSION: There was low awareness of NBS and comprehensive care for babies with SCD among mothers with newborns, however acceptability for NBS was high. There is a considerable need to bridge the communication gap between health workers and parents to increase their awareness.
38000628		Gene-addition/editing therapy in sickle cell disease.Gene therapy is an innovative strategy that offers potential cure for patients with sickle cell disease, and no appropriate donor for transplant consideration. While we await long term data from these clinical trials, we remain optimistic that gene therapy will become a standard of care for curative treatment in sickle cell disease. As gene therapy becomes a standard of treatment in sickle cell disease, we must also acknowledge the potential for financial burden to patients. We also must acknowledge the prevalence of sickle cell disease in low-resource settings. Hopefully, as we learn more about gene therapy, we can assess ways to overcome the financial toxicity that comes with this therapy.
36583467		Individual-level behavioral interventions to support optimal development of children with sickle cell disease: A systematic review.This review aimed to identify and describe individual-level behavioral interventions for children 0-18 years of age with sickle cell disease (SCD). PRISMA guidelines were followed at each stage of this review. Twenty-seven studies were included, representing six intervention types: disease knowledge (n = 7), self-management (n = 7), pain management (n = 4), school functioning (n = 4), cognitive health (n = 4), and mental health (n = 2). Most interventions targeted older children (5+ years), while only two examined interventions for children 0-3 years. This review suggests that offering education about disease knowledge, self-management, and pain management interventions can be beneficial for this population. Future research is needed to understand interventions to support young children and the impact of SCD on development.

Males have a higher susceptibility to hemolysis than females, but little is known about the genetic mechanism contributing to the difference. RESULTS: To investigate the sex differences in RBC susceptibility to hemolysis, we conducted a sex-stratified genome-wide association study and a genome-wide gene-by-sex interaction scan in a multi-ethnic dataset with 12,231 blood donors who have in vitro osmotic hemolysis measurements during routine blood storage. The estimated SNP-based heritability for osmotic hemolysis was found to be significantly higher in males than in females (0.46 vs. 0.41). We identified SNPs associated with sex-specific susceptibility to osmotic hemolysis in five loci (SPTA1, KCNA6, SLC4A1, SUMO1P1, and PAX8) that impact RBC function and hemolysis. CONCLUSION: Our study established a best practice to identify sex-specific genetic modifiers for sexually dimorphic traits in datasets with mixed ancestries, providing evidence of different genetic regulations of RBC susceptibility to hemolysis between sexes. These and other variants may help explain observed sex differences in the severity of hemolytic diseases, such as sickle cell and malaria, as well as the viability of red cell storage and recovery.

35405024		DNA testing for sickle cell anemia in Africa: Implementation choices for the Democratic Republic of Congo.BACKGROUND: Hemoglobin-based tests form the reference diagnostic test for SCA. In limited resource countries, these tests face limitations including cost, low sensitivity due to recurrent transfusions in endemic malaria region, and interference from fetal hemoglobin in neonatal diagnostic. This study aimed at adapting DNA-based SCA tests to limited resource countries and evaluating the economic benefit. METHODS: 338 participants were recruited in the Democratic Republic of Congo, sorted in 3 cohorts based on venous blood, umbilical cord blood (UCB) and buccal swab sampling. RFLP was performed to identify mutated allele. The feasibility and technical validity of this RFLP was evaluated for specimens collected on DBS cards and on EDTA tubes. RFLP on DBS stored at room temperature was regularly repeated to assess sample conservation. Finally, the cost analysis was performed. RESULTS: DBS cards yielded identical results to extracted DNA. Repeated testing returned the same result after four years. The DBS-based test performed on UCB or on buccal swab had a sensitivity and a precision of 100%. Cost comparison indicated that our approach costs half price of the widely used isoelectrofocussing of hemoglobin. CONCLUSION: The implemented DNA-based test approach overcomes the limitations faced by hemoglobin-based tests, while being more affordable. We propose to implement the RFLP test as a first line diagnostic test after transfusion and as second tiers for newborn screening. However, users should be aware that this test is unable to differentiate HbC from HbS or identify other point mutation of gene deletion of HBB gene.
38069526		Euvolemic automated transfusion to treat severe anemia in sickle cell disease patients at risk of circulatory overload.BACKGROUND: Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion remains a major treatment for sickle cell disease (SCD). Patients with SCD have a high prevalence of renal impairment and cardiorespiratory disease, conferring risk of transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We describe an approach, titled euvolemic automated transfusion (EAT), to transfuse SCD patients with severe anemia who are at risk of TACO. In EAT, plasmapheresis is performed using donor RBCs, rather than albumin or plasma, as replacement fluid. Euvolemia is maintained. A retrospective analysis was conducted of patients with SCD who underwent EAT at our institution over a 10-year period, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of EAT. RESULTS: Eleven SCD patients underwent 109 EAT procedures (1-59 procedures per patient). The median age was 42 years (IQR = [30-49]) and 82% (n = 9) were female. Most (82%; n = 9) patients had severe chronic kidney disease and 55% (n = 6) had heart failure. One (9%) patient had a history of life-threatening TACO. Mean pre- and post-procedure Hct values were 19.8% (SD   1.6%) and 29.1% (SD   1.4%), respectively. The average Hct increment was 3.2% per RBC unit. Only two EAT-related complications were recorded during the 109 procedures: central line-associated infection and citrate toxicity (muscle cramping). EAT used an average of two RBC units less than that projected for standard automated RBC exchange. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that EAT is safe and effective to treat patients with SCD and severe anemia, who are at risk for TACO. EAT requires fewer RBC units compared to automated RBC exchange.
36354234		Safety of coronavirus disease 2019 vaccines in 213 adult patients with sickle cell disease.Given the lack of information about safety of the COVID-19 vaccines for sickle cell disease (SCD) patients, we sought to determine whether COVID-19 vaccine was associated with subsequent hospital admission for vaso-occlusive events (VOEs). We included 402 patients with SCD, including 88 regularly transfused. As of July 31, 2021, 213 (53.0%) of them had received a least one dose of COVID vaccine (Pfizer 93.0%). We showed similar risk of hospital admission for a VOE among vaccinated patients (whether transfused or not) and among a control group of non-vaccinated patients matched for age, sex and genotype.
38066846		Logistics, risks, and benefits of automated red blood cell exchange for patients with sickle cell disease.Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions treat and prevent severe complications of sickle cell disease (SCD) and can be delivered as a simple or exchange transfusion. During an exchange, some of the patient's abnormal hemoglobin (Hb) S (HbS) RBCs are removed. An apheresis device can accomplish an automated RBC exchange, simultaneously removing patient's RBCs while returning other blood components along with normal RBCs. Automated RBC exchange is therefore an isovolemic transfusion that can efficiently decrease HbS RBCs while limiting iron loading and hyperviscosity. However, specialized equipment, trained personnel, appropriate vascular access, and increased RBC exposure are required compared to simple or manual RBC exchange. Therefore, risks and benefits must be balanced to make individualized decisions for patients with SCD who require transfusion.
37776703		Evaluation of a prophylactic transfusion program on obstetric outcomes in pregnant women with sickle cell disease: A single centre retrospective cohort study.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of a prophylactic transfusion program (TP) on obstetric and perinatal outcomes in pregnant women with sickle cell disease (SCD). METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included all singleton pregnancies among women with SCD in a French university tertiary care center between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2017. The TP group included patients selected according to the French guidelines who received regular red blood cell transfusions during pregnancy until delivery. The factors associated with TP indication [year of birth, SCD genotype, history of acute chest syndrome and delayed hemolysis transfusion reaction (DHTR) risk score] were taken into account in a propensity score. A composite obstetric adverse outcome was defined associating birth before 34 gestational weeks and/or pre-eclampsia and/or small for gestational age and/or abruption and/or stillbirth and/or maternal death and/or neonatal death. RESULTS: In total, 246 pregnancies in 173 patients were analyzed. Twenty-two pregnancies with a history of DHTR were excluded. A higher frequency of TP was found before 2013 [119/148 (80.4%) vs 38/76 (50%); p < 0.001]. Rates of preterm birth before 34 gestational weeks (5.6% vs 19.7%; p = 0.001), vaso-occlusive crisis (36.5% vs. 61.8%; p < 0.001), and acute chest syndrome (6.1% vs. 14.5%; p = 0.04) during pregnancy were decreased significantly in the TP group. Among the groups with and without composite obstetric adverse outcomes, the frequency of TP was 52.6% and 74.7%, respectively [odds ratio (OR) 0.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.09-1.02]. The multivariate analysis shows that the TP was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of composite obstetric adverse outcomes (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.08-0.97; p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: A red blood cell TP may have an independent protective effect on maternal and perinatal adverse outcomes during pregnancy in women with SCD.
33625093		Transcranial Doppler Screening in a Current Cohort of Children With Sickle Cell Anemia: Results From the DISPLACE Study.Stroke prevention guidelines for sickle cell anemia (SCA) recommend transcranial Doppler (TCD) screening to identify children at stroke risk; however, TCD screening implementation remains poor. This report describes results from Part 1 of the 28-site DISPLACE (Dissemination and Implementation of Stroke Prevention Looking at the Care Environment) study, a baseline assessment of TCD implementation rates. This report describes TCD implementation by consortium site characteristics; characteristics of TCDs completed; and TCD results based on age. The cohort included 5247 children with SCA, of whom 5116 were eligible for TCD implementation assessment for at least 1 study year. The majority of children were African American or Black, non-Hispanic and received Medicaid. Mean age at first recorded TCD was 5.9 and 10.5 years at study end. Observed TCD screening rates were unsatisfactory across geographic regions (mean 49.9%; range: 30.9% to 74.7%) independent of size, institution type, or previous stroke prevention trial participation. The abnormal TCD rate was 2.9%, with a median age of 6.3 years for first abnormal TCD result. Findings highlight real-world TCD screening practices and results from the largest SCA cohort to date. Data informed the part 3 implementation study for improving stroke screening and findings may inform clinical practice improvements.
