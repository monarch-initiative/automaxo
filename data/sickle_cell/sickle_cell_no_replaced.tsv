37541800	Global burden of transfusion in sickle cell disease.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common hereditary hemoglobinopathy. The underlying pathophysiology of the red blood cell (RBC) leads to pan-systemic complications which manifest at an early age. While curative and disease-modifying treatments exist for SCD, a key intervention in the management and treatment of SCD is RBC transfusion, which can alleviate or prevent many complications. SCD patients often require chronic RBC transfusion therapy which can result in complications, such as iron overload, alloimmunization and infection. In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), SCD patients lack appropriate access to healthcare such as newborn screening, health education, prophylaxis for infection, and treatments to reduce both mortality and SCD-related adverse effects. Poor access to RBCs for transfusion, coupled with donated blood not meeting safety standards set by the World Health Organization, presents a significant barrier for patients requiring chronic transfusions in LMICs. Unmet needs associated with blood collection, blood component processing and recipient matching all pose a serious problem in many LMICs, although this varies depending on geographic location, political organizations and economy. This review aims to provide an overview of the global burden of SCD, focusing on the availability of current treatments and the burden of chronic RBC transfusions in patients with SCD.
35929611	The effect of intensity of conditioning regimen on the outcome of HSCT in children with sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) provides a cure for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). This study describes the effect of conditioning regimen intensity on HSCT outcomes among children younger than 14 years with SCD. METHODS: Transplants from HLA-matched related donors (MRD) and unrelated donors (MUD) using either myeloablative conditioning (MAC) regimens or reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens were considered. Event-free survival (EFS) was the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS) and occurrence of GVHD. RESULTS: 48 SCD patients underwent HSCT, 45 (93.8%) patients had MRD, 1 (2.1%) had 9/10 related donor, and 2 (4.1%) had MUD. The median age at transplant was 8.6 years (range, 3.1-13.8). Conditioning regimens were myeloablative (MAC) in 41 (85.4%) patients and of reduced intensity in 7 (14.6%) patients. EFS at 2 years was 100% among MAC group compared to 29% in the RIC group (p < .001). The median follow-up was 43.4 months (range 26.8-134). All events in the RIC group were secondary graft failure. However, OS was 100% in both groups at 2 years. Acute GVHD II-IV was diagnosed in 2 (4.1%) patients. Chronic GVHD occurred in 2 (4.1%) patients. GVHD did not occur in patients who underwent MUD HSCT. CONCLUSIONS: MAC in children with SCD is well tolerated and associated with an excellent outcome for HLA-matched HSCT in SCD. There was a high rate of secondary graft failure with the use of RIC. Future studies are needed to optimize RIC regimens in HSCT of children with SCD.
37023225	Managing Sickle Cell Disease in Patients for Whom Blood Transfusion Is Not an Option.	Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is a hereditary blood disorder affecting beta hemoglobin. This disorder causes sickle-shaped red blood cells with decreased oxygen-carrying capacity resulting in vaso-occlusive crises. These crises are often treated with analgesics, antibiotics, IV fluids, supplementary oxygen, and allogeneic blood transfusion. This treatment regimen becomes complicated when caring for SCD patients for whom blood transfusion is not an option. Blood transfusion may not be an option due to the patient's religious, personal, or medical concerns and in scenarios where blood is not available for transfusion. Some examples include the patient being a Jehovah's Witness, blood-borne pathogens concerns, or prior history of multiple alloantibodies and severe transfusion reactions. The number of patients in these categories is growing. The patients and their autonomy should be respected during treatment. This review focuses on the currently available modalities to best manage this subgroup of SCD patients without blood transfusion, including new professional guidelines and new therapies to reduce the severity of SCD as approved by the Food and Drug Administration since 2017.

32771206	[Effects of a standardized musical intervention on the management of pain and anxiety-state of sickle-cell adolescents].	The effect of a standardized musical intervention for adolescents with sickle cell disease was studied. Two groups were evaluated using the visual analog scale of pain and the anxiety-state inventory before and after a standardized musical intervention or breathing intervention. A significant decrease in scores was observed, most notably for the group benefiting from the standardized musical intervention. This intervention could be integrated into the overall management of adolescents with sickle cell disease.
36790450	A Qualitative Systematic Review of Pediatric Patient and Caregiver Perspectives on Pain Management for Vaso-Occlusive Episodes in the Emergency Department.	OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this study is to describe the experiences of pediatric patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and their caregivers who have presented to the emergency department (ED) for management of vaso-occlusive pain events. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative systematic review. The search protocol was developed to identify both published and unpublished literature that met inclusion/exclusion criteria. Included articles were primary hospital-based research with study populations that included (but were not limited to) pediatric patients aged 21 years or younger and qualitative or mixed-method analysis. RESULTS: Four themes were identified: (1) patients and caregivers perceive the ED as the last resort; (2) health care professionals in the ED lacked knowledge about SCD but rejected patients' and caregiver's attempts to share experience or advocate for their needs; (3) patients' accounts of pain are doubted because they do not always have "typical" signs of pain; and (4) caregivers identify racism as a reason for suboptimal care in the ED. CONCLUSIONS: There are multiple opportunities to improve management for vaso-occlusive pain events in the ED, including education of health care providers about SCD and complications, partnership between patients/caregivers and providers, and efforts to reduce the impact of systemic racism on health care delivery.
32897878	BCL11A enhancer-edited hematopoietic stem cells persist in rhesus monkeys without toxicity.	Gene editing of the erythroid-specific BCL11A enhancer in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) from patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) induces fetal hemoglobin (HbF) without detectable toxicity, as assessed by mouse xenotransplant. Here, we evaluated autologous engraftment and HbF induction potential of erythroid-specific BCL11A enhancer-edited HSPCs in 4 nonhuman primates. We used a single guide RNA (sgRNA) with identical human and rhesus target sequences to disrupt a GATA1 binding site at the BCL11A +58 erythroid enhancer. Cas9 protein and sgRNA ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP) was electroporated into rhesus HSPCs, followed by autologous infusion after myeloablation. We found that gene edits persisted in peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) for up to 101 weeks similarly for BCL11A enhancer- or control locus-targeted (AAVS1-targeted) cells. Biallelic BCL11A enhancer editing resulted in robust gamma-globin induction, with the highest levels observed during stress erythropoiesis. Indels were evenly distributed across PB and BM lineages. Off-target edits were not observed. Nonhomologous end-joining repair alleles were enriched in engrafting HSCs. In summary, we found that edited HSCs can persist for at least 101 weeks after transplant and biallelic-edited HSCs provide substantial HbF levels in PB red blood cells, together supporting further clinical translation of this approach.
32725288	Key role of pediatricians and disease for influenza vaccination in children with high-risk chronic diseases.	Annual influenza vaccination is recommended for children with chronic diseases. Studies on influenza vaccines, following controversies related to the 2009 H1N1 influenza, are scarce in Europe. Our aim was to evaluate the influenza vaccination coverage in such children in a French tertiary hospital. Secondary objectives were the evaluation of the influenza vaccination coverage trend and the identification of factors influencing the vaccination status. A prospective and descriptive study by questionnaire was performed at the end of 2017 in 402 French hospital outpatients with various underlying chronic diseases eligible to the influenza vaccination. The 2016-2017 vaccination coverage was 46.5%. Figures of 75% or greater were only found in patients with cystic fibrosis and sickle cell disease. CART analysis identified vaccination in the previous year, medical recommendation for vaccination, and maternal influenza vaccination as a child's decisive factors for being vaccinated.Conclusion: Influenza vaccination coverage remains insufficient in children receiving hospital follow-up for chronic diseases. Its implementation clearly depends on pediatricians' recommendation to vaccinate and on the type of chronic disease. What is Known:   Despite health policy recommendations, the rate of annual influenza vaccination in children with chronic diseases is low What is New:   Influenza vaccination coverage depends on the type of chronic disease and on the pediatricians' counseling to vaccine.
35605629	Post-discharge morbidity and mortality in children admitted with severe anaemia and other health conditions in malaria-endemic settings in Africa: a systematic review and meta-analysis.	BACKGROUND: Severe anaemia is associated with high in-hospital mortality among young children. In malaria-endemic areas, surviving children also remain at increased risk of mortality for several months after hospital discharge. We aimed to compare the risks of morbidity and mortality among children discharged from hospital after recovery from severe anaemia versus other health conditions in malaria-endemic settings in Africa. METHODS: Following PRISMA guidelines, we searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central from inception to Nov 30, 2021, without language restrictions, for prospective or retrospective cohort studies and randomised controlled trials that followed up children younger than 15 years for defined periods after hospital discharge in malaria-endemic countries in Africa. We excluded the intervention groups in trials and studies or subgroups involving children with sickle cell anaemia, malignancies, or surgery or trauma, or those reporting follow-up data that were combined with the in-hospital period. Two independent reviewers extracted the data and assessed the quality and risk of bias using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale or the Cochrane Collaboration's tool. The coprimary outcomes were all-cause death and all-cause readmissions 6 months after discharge. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42017079282. FINDINGS: Of 2930 articles identified in our search, 27 studies were included. For children who were recently discharged following hospital admission with severe anaemia, all-cause mortality by 6 months was higher than during the in-hospital period (n=5 studies; Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio 1 72, 95% CI 1 22-2 44; p=0 0020; I2=51 5%) and more than two times higher than children previously admitted without severe anaemia (n=4 studies; relative risk [RR] 2 69, 95% CI 1 59-4 53; p<0 0001; I2=69 2%). Readmissions within 6 months of discharge were also more common in children admitted with severe anaemia than in children admitted with other conditions (n=1 study; RR 3 05, 1 12-8 35; p<0 0001). Children admitted with severe acute malnutrition (regardless of severe anaemia) also had a higher 6-month mortality after discharge than those admitted for other reasons (n=2 studies; RR=3 12, 2 02-4 68; p<0 0001; I2=54 7%). Other predictors of mortality after discharge included discharge against medical advice, HIV, bacteraemia, and hypoxia. INTERPRETATION: In malaria-endemic settings in Africa, children admitted to hospital with severe anaemia and severe acute malnutrition are at increased risk of mortality in the first 6 months after discharge compared with children admitted with other health conditions. Improved strategies are needed for the management of these high-risk groups during the period after discharge. FUNDING: Research Council of Norway and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
33979369	Cardiovascular benefits of a home-based exercise program in patients with sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Physical inactivity is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The benefits of exercise in patients with chronic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, are well established. For patients with sickle cell disease, medical recommendation was to avoid physical exercise for fear of triggering painful crises or increasing the impairment of the cardiopulmonary function. Only recently, studies have shown safety in exercise programs for this population. Despite that, there is no report that assess the effects of physical exercise on cardiac parameters in patients with sickle cell disease. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the impact of regular physical exercise (a home-based program) on cardiovascular function in patients with sickle cell disease. DESIGN: A quasi-randomized prospective controlled trial. SETTING: During the years 2015 and 2016, we started recruiting among adult patients treated at a Brazilian Center for Patients with Sickle Cell Disease to participate in a study involving a home exercise program. The experimental (exercise) and control groups were submitted to clinical evaluation and cardiovascular tests before and after the intervention. Analysis of variance was applied to compare groups, considering time and group factors. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-seven adult outpatients with a sickle cell disease diagnosis. INTERVENTIONS: Exercise group (N = 14): a regular home-based aerobic exercise program, three to five times per week not exceeding give times per week, for eight weeks; no prescription for the control group (N = 13). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Echocardiographic and treadmill test parameters. RESULTS: The exercise group showed significant improvement in cardiovascular tests, demonstrated by increased distance traveled on a treadmill (p<0.01), increased ejection fraction (p < 0.01) and improvement of diastolic function assessed by mitral tissue Doppler E' wave on echocardiography (p = 0.04). None of the patients presented a sickle cell crisis or worsening of symptoms during the exercise program. CONCLUSION: The selected home-based exercise program is safe, feasible, and promotes a favorable impact on functional capacity and cardiovascular function in sickle cell disease patients.
33283989	CRISPR-Cas9 Gene Editing for Sickle Cell Disease and beta-Thalassemia.	Transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia (TDT) and sickle cell disease (SCD) are severe monogenic diseases with severe and potentially life-threatening manifestations. BCL11A is a transcription factor that represses gamma-globin expression and fetal hemoglobin in erythroid cells. We performed electroporation of CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells obtained from healthy donors, with CRISPR-Cas9 targeting the BCL11A erythroid-specific enhancer. Approximately 80% of the alleles at this locus were modified, with no evidence of off-target editing. After undergoing myeloablation, two patients - one with TDT and the other with SCD - received autologous CD34+ cells edited with CRISPR-Cas9 targeting the same BCL11A enhancer. More than a year later, both patients had high levels of allelic editing in bone marrow and blood, increases in fetal hemoglobin that were distributed pancellularly, transfusion independence, and (in the patient with SCD) elimination of vaso-occlusive episodes.

36485129	Knowledge to date on secondary malignancy following hematopoietic cell transplantation for sickle cell disease.	Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation, gene therapy, and gene editing offer a potential cure for sickle cell disease (SCD). Unfortunately, myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia development have been higher than expected after graft rejection following nonmyeloablative conditioning and lentivirus-based gene therapy employing myeloablative busulfan for SCD. Somatic mutations discovered in 2 of 76 patients who rejected their grafts were identified at baseline at much lower levels. While a whole-genome sequencing analysis reported no difference between patients with SCD and controls, a study including whole-exome sequencing revealed a higher prevalence of clonal hematopoiesis in individuals with SCD compared with controls. Genetic risk factors for myeloid malignancy development after curative therapy for SCD are currently being explored. Once discovered, decisions could be made about whether gene therapy may be feasible vs allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant, which results in full donor chimerism. In the meantime, care should be taken to perform a benefit/risk assessment to help patients identify the best curative approach for them. Long-term follow-up is necessary to monitor for myeloid malignancies and other adverse effects of curative therapies for SCD.
31631427	Challenges in providing compatible blood with Rh genotype-matching in Brazilian patients with sickle cell disease.	OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to verify the possibility of performing prophylactic Rh genotype-matching in Brazilian patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and identify the genotypes that are lacking or insufficient in our donor cohort. BACKGROUND: Rh alloimmunisation is still a challenge in transfused patients with SCD. Rh genotype-matching may mitigate Rh alloimmunisation. METHODS/MATERIALS: We examined the transfusion requests for antigen-matched donor units in SCD patients with Rh variants and compared the Rh altered alleles in the patients to the Rh allele frequency in a selected donor population. For each patient and donor, RBC antigen genotyping was performed using HEA, RHD and RHCE BeadChip arrays. Sequencing was used to clarify inconclusive results. Twenty-one patients and 956 Brazilian blood donors were genotyped. RESULTS: According to our matching strategies, 47 6% of patients filled most of their unit requests, but 52 4% of patients had insufficient donors to fill their annual transfusion needs. We found different combinations of RHCE variant alleles in patients and donors, but the most frequent genotypes that are lacking or insufficient in our donor cohort are those associated with the lack of hrB and hrS high prevalence antigens and those co-inherited with altered RHD alleles. CONCLUSION: Our study shows that the provision of compatible blood with Rh genotype-matching in Brazilian patients with SCD can be feasible but challenging and, efficient strategies of recruitment of African-Brazilian donors must be developed.

33268304	Understanding the demand for phenotyped red blood cell units and requests to perform molecular red blood cell typing for Australian patients.	BACKGROUND: Australian Red Cross Lifeblood has seen a 50 % increase in demand for phenotyped red blood cell (RBC) units between 2016-2018 and a 30 % increase in demand in 2018 to perform molecular RBC typing on patient samples. Lifeblood conducted a survey to understand transfusion laboratory practices for requesting patient phenotyping and/or molecular RBC typing and for selecting phenotyped RBC units in various patient groups. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: An electronic Qualtrics survey form was sent to 296 transfusion laboratories with questions designed to understand the practice of selecting phenotyped RBC units and reasons for requesting extended serology or molecular RBC typing. RESULTS: 49 (16.6 %) transfusion laboratories provided data. Reasons to request extended phenotyping and/or molecular RBC typing for patients included; chronic transfusion (n = 31 laboratories), sickle cell disease (n = 25), Thalassemia (n = 23), requirement for anti-CD38 or other MAB therapy (n = 23) or Myelodysplasia (n = 22). Forty-seven transfusion laboratories provided responses with reasons for requesting molecular RBC typing which included: predicting phenotype in patients with multiple antibodies (n = 31), prior to administering anti-CD38 or other MAB therapies (n = 29), for pregnancy related transfusions (n = 28) or for confirming the phenotype of recently transfused patients (n = 18). CONCLUSION: Transfusion laboratory practices indicated that phenotyped RBC units were selected for patients requiring chronic transfusion support and/or undergoing MAB therapy. Requests for molecular RBC typing occurred for more complex patient requirements where serological investigations were not suitable or possible due to reagent restrictions.
36322937	Hydroxyurea for secondary stroke prevention in children with sickle cell anemia in Nigeria: a randomized controlled trial.	We tested the hypothesis that fixed oral moderate-dose hydroxyurea (20 mg/kg per day) for initial treatment of secondary stroke prevention results in an 80% relative risk reduction of stroke or death when compared with fixed oral low-dose hydroxyurea (10 mg/kg per day) in a phase 3 double-blind, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial in children with sickle cell anemia (SCA) living in Nigeria. A total of 101 participants were randomly allocated to low-dose (n = 49) and moderate-dose (n = 52) hydroxyurea treatment groups. The median participant follow-up was 1.6 years (interquartile range, 1.0-2.3), with a planned minimum follow-up of 3.0 years. A total of 6 recurrent strokes and 2 deaths vs 5 recurrent strokes and 3 deaths occurred in the low- and moderate-dose groups, respectively. The incidence rate ratio (IRR) of the primary outcome measure of stroke or death in the low- and moderate-dose hydroxyurea treatment groups was 0.98 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.32-3.00; P = .97). The trial was stopped early owing to no clinical difference in the incidence rates of the primary outcome measure. The incidence rates of recurrent strokes were 7.1 and 6.0 per 100 person-years in the low- and moderate-dose groups, respectively, (IRR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.30-4.88; P = .74). As a measure of adherence to the oral hydroxyurea therapy, the median percent of returned pills was 3.0% and 2.6% in the low- and moderate-dose groups, respectively. No participant had hydroxyurea therapy stopped for myelosuppression. For children with SCA in low-income settings without access to regular blood transfusion therapy, initial low-dose hydroxyurea is a minimum known efficacious dose for secondary stroke prevention.
32266061	What are the outcomes of core decompression in patients with avascular necrosis? Protocol for a systematic review.	Background: Core decompression is a hip preserving surgical procedure that is used to treat avascular necrosis (AVN) of the femoral head. The eventual clinical and radiological outcome following this procedure is varied in literature. Also, the time to a total hip replacement (THR) from the index procedure and the percentage of patients subsequently undergoing a THR is controversial. Furthermore, there are multiple surgical methods along with multiple augmentation techniques and various classification and staging systems described. The purpose of this systematic review, therefore, is to analyse the outcomes following decompression only, excluding any augmentation techniques for non-traumatic AVN of the femoral head. Methods: This protocol is being developed in line with the PRISMA-P guidelines. The search strategy includes articles from Medline, Embase, Google Scholar, CINHAL and Cochrane library. The review and screening will be done by two independent reviewers. Review articles, editorials and correspondences will be excluded. Articles including patients with sickle cell disease and with core decompression where augmentation is used will be excluded. The risk of bias and quality of articles will be assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for the different study designs included. Discussion: This study will be a comprehensive review on all published articles having patients with AVN of the femoral head and undergoing core decompression surgery only. The systematic review will then define the outcomes of the core decompression surgery based on clinical and radiological outcomes. Each outcome will include the different stages within it and finally, the total mean time to THR will be calculated. This will then be followed by assessing the cumulative confidence in evidence from all the data collected using the GRADE tool.   Registration: This systematic review is registered in the International Prospective Register for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PROSPERO) under the registration number:  CRD42018100596.

32518950	Risk score to predict event-free survival after hematopoietic cell transplant for sickle cell disease.	We developed a risk score to predict event-free survival (EFS) after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation for sickle cell disease. The study population (n = 1425) was randomly split into training (n = 1070) and validation (n = 355) cohorts. Risk factors were identified and validated via Cox regression models. Two risk factors of 9 evaluated were predictive for EFS: age at transplantation and donor type. On the basis of the training cohort, patients age 12 years or younger with an HLA-matched sibling donor were at the lowest risk with a 3-year EFS of 92% (score, 0). Patients age 13 years or older with an HLA-matched sibling donor or age 12 years or younger with an HLA-matched unrelated donor were at intermediate risk (3-year EFS, 87%; score, 1). All other groups, including patients of any age with a haploidentical relative or HLA-mismatched unrelated donor and patients age 13 years or older with an HLA-matched unrelated donor were high risk (3-year EFS, 57%; score, 2 or 3). These findings were confirmed in the validation cohort. This simple risk score may guide patients with sickle cell disease and hematologists who are considering allogeneic transplantation as a curative treatment relative to other available contemporary treatments.
32929175	Pre-transplant myeloid and immune suppression, upfront plerixafor mobilization and post-transplant cyclophosphamide: novel strategy for haploidentical transplant in sickle cell disease.	Allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant is the only curative option for symptomatic sickle cell disease (SCD). HLA haploidentical related donor transplants are associated with high graft failure rates. We conceptualized a novel protocol (APOLLO protocol) using pre-transplant immune and myelosuppression (PTIS) using fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone followed by augmented John Hopkins protocol by adding thiotepa to conditioning. Twenty-five consecutive patients suffering from symptomatic SCD were enrolled into the study. We added upfront plerixafor to granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF) for mobilization of healthy donors. Graft versus host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis was done using post-transplant cyclophosphamide, sirolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil. Graft failure was not seen in any of our patients. Five patients developed acute grade II/IV GvHD (4 classical acute, 1 late onset), 3 had limited chronic GvHD. Out of 25 evaluable patients, 22 are alive and disease free, making an overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) of 88% with a median follow up of 485 days (range 198-802). T-cell-replete haploidentical transplant with PTIS, augmented John Hopkins conditioning and plerixafor based mobilization is a safe and effective way of treating patients suffering from SCD with minimal or no risk of graft failure and acceptable GvHD rates.

35811388	Ten-year longitudinal analysis of hydroxyurea implementation in a pediatric sickle cell program.	Hydroxyurea (HU) has proven benefit in sickle cell anemia (SCA), but HU is still underutilized. The Pediatric Sickle Cell Program of Northern Virginia prescribes HU regardless of symptoms to all SCA patients age >= 9 months and prospectively tracks outcomes. HU is dosed to maximum tolerated dosing (MTD), targeting 30% Hgb F. Longitudinal data from 2009 to 2019 encompassing 1222 HU-eligible and 950 HU-exposure patient-years were analyzed in 2-year intervals for hemoglobin (Hgb), fetal hemoglobin (Hgb F), hospitalizations, transfusions, and treat-and-release ED visits. Comparing HU-eligible patients in the interval prior to HU implementation (2009-2011) to the last interval analyzed after HU implementation (2017-2019), HU usage increased from 33% to 93%, average Hgb increased from 8.3 +- 0.98 to 9.8 +- 1.3 g/dl (p < .0001), average Hgb F rose from 13 +- 8.7% to 26 +- 9.9% (p < .0001), hospitalizations decreased from 0.71 (95% CI 0.54-0.91) to 0.2 (95% CI 0.13-0.28) admissions/person-year, sporadic transfusions decreased from 0.4 (95% CI 0.27-0.55) to 0.05 (95% CI 0.02-0.12) transfusions/person-year. Treat-and-release ED visit rates remained unchanged, varying between 0.49 (95% CI 0.36-0.64) and 0.64 (95% CI 0.48-0.83) visits/person-year. By the last interval, 72% of patients had Hgb >= 9 g/dl, 42% had Hgb F >= 30%, 79% experienced no hospitalizations, and 94% received no transfusions. Uniform HU prescription for SCA patients with close monitoring to achieve high Hgb F resulted in significant improvements in laboratory and clinical outcomes within 2 years, which continued to improve over the next 6 years. Rigorous HU implementation in a pediatric sickle cell population is feasible, effective, and sustainable.
32729340	Heme Causes Pain in Sickle Mice via Toll-Like Receptor 4-Mediated Reactive Oxygen Species- and Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress-Induced Glial Activation.	Aims: Lifelong pain is a hallmark feature of sickle cell disease (SCD). How sickle pathobiology evokes pain remains unknown. We hypothesize that increased cell-free heme due to ongoing hemolysis activates toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), leading to the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Together, these processes lead to spinal microglial activation and neuroinflammation, culminating in acute and chronic pain. Results: Spinal heme levels, TLR4 transcripts, oxidative stress, and ER stress were significantly higher in sickle mice than controls. In vitro, TLR4 inhibition in spinal cord microglial cells attenuated heme-induced ROS and ER stress. Heme treatment led to a time-dependent increase in the characteristic features of sickle pain (mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia) in both sickle and control mice; this effect was absent in TLR4-knockout sickle and control mice. TLR4 deletion in sickle mice attenuated chronic and hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-evoked acute hyperalgesia. Sickle mice treated with the TLR4 inhibitor resatorvid; selective small-molecule inhibitor of TLR4 (TAK242) had significantly reduced chronic hyperalgesia and had less severe H/R-evoked acute pain with quicker recovery. Notably, reducing ER stress with salubrinal ameliorated chronic hyperalgesia in sickle mice. Innovation: Our findings demonstrate the causal role of free heme in the genesis of acute and chronic sickle pain and suggest that TLR4 and/or ER stress are novel therapeutic targets for treating pain in SCD. Conclusion: Heme-induced microglial activation via TLR4 in the central nervous system contributes to the initiation and maintenance of sickle pain via ER stress in SCD. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 34, 279-293.
31743315	Social Determinants of Health and Emergency Department Use Among Children With Sickle Cell Disease.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is associated with disproportionate emergency department (ED) use. This study described the social determinants of health associated with ED visits and hospital admission from the ED among children with SCD using a nationally representative dataset. We analyzed data from 126 children 0 to 17 years of age with SCD included in the 2011 to 2017 rounds of the National Health Interview Survey (mean age, 8 y; 50% female individuals; 74% African American). Study variables were summarized using weighted means and proportions and compared according to ED use and admission by Wald tests. Fifty-two identified children had visited the ED within the last 12 months and 21 were admitted to the hospital after their most recent ED visit. Children living in a single-mother household were more likely to visit the ED (P=0.040), as were younger children (mean age, 6 vs. 9 y; P=0.034), with no evaluated social determinants of health significantly impacting hospital admission from the ED. The lack of association between ED use and either poverty or insurance type may be related to the overall high level of social disadvantage among children with SCD. Our findings demonstrate the need to better characterize specific social factors impacting acute care use among children with SCD.
32889827	Role of complement in alloimmunization and hyperhemolysis.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to summarize the role of complement in regulating the removal of a target alloantigen following an incompatible red blood cell (RBC) transfusion, the formation of alloantibodies following RBC alloantigen exposure, and the development of hyperhemolysis in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies demonstrate that complement can accelerate alloantibody-mediated removal of target alloantigens from the RBC surface following incompatible transfusion. Complement also influences alloantigen availability during developing alloimmune responses and serves as a unique mediator of CD4 T-cell-independent alloantibody formation following RBC alloantigen exposure. Finally, alternative complement pathway activation appears to play a key role in the development of acute hemolytic episodes in patients with SCD, providing a potential druggable target to prevent acute complications in patients with this disease. SUMMARY: Recent studies suggest that complement can regulate a wide variety of processes germane to hematology, from transfusion complications to baseline hemolysis in patients with SCD. As the role of complement in various disease processes becomes more fully understood, the ability to leverage recently developed complement modulating drugs will only continue to enhance providers' ability to favorably intervene in many hematological diseases.

Induction of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) via clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/Cas9-mediated disruption of DNA regulatory elements that repress gamma-globin gene (HBG1 and HBG2) expression is a promising therapeutic strategy for sickle cell disease (SCD) and beta-thalassemia, although the optimal technical approaches and limiting toxicities are not yet fully defined. We disrupted an HBG1/HBG2 gene promoter motif that is bound by the transcriptional repressor BCL11A. Electroporation of Cas9 single guide RNA ribonucleoprotein complex into normal and SCD donor CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells resulted in high frequencies of on-target mutations and the induction of HbF to potentially therapeutic levels in erythroid progeny generated in vitro and in vivo after transplantation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells into nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency/Il2rgamma-/-/KitW41/W41 immunodeficient mice. On-target editing did not impair CD34+ cell regeneration or differentiation into erythroid, T, B, or myeloid cell lineages at 16 to 17 weeks after xenotransplantation. No off-target mutations were detected by targeted sequencing of candidate sites identified by circularization for in vitro reporting of cleavage effects by sequencing (CIRCLE-seq), an in vitro genome-scale method for detecting Cas9 activity. Engineered Cas9 containing 3 nuclear localization sequences edited human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells more efficiently and consistently than conventional Cas9 with 2 nuclear localization sequences. Our studies provide novel and essential preclinical evidence supporting the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of a mechanism-based approach to induce HbF for treating hemoglobinopathies.
32941305	Managing patients with sickle cell disease in primary care.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of disorders affecting the hemoglobin in erythrocytes. SCD is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and occurs most commonly among people of African ancestry. In 2014, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute updated its guidelines for the management of SCD. These guidelines were implemented to provide evidence-based recommendations to assist primary care clinicians in the proper management of patients with SCD. This article reviews the current practice guidelines for SCD, with attention to health maintenance and hydroxyurea.
33723861	Vasculo-toxic and pro-inflammatory action of unbound haemoglobin, haem and iron in transfusion-dependent patients with haemolytic anaemias.	Increasing evidence suggests that free haem and iron exert vasculo-toxic and pro-inflammatory effects by activating endothelial and immune cells. In the present retrospective study, we compared serum samples from transfusion-dependent patients with beta-thalassaemia major and intermedia, hereditary spherocytosis and sickle cell disease (SCD). Haemolysis, transfusions and ineffective erythropoiesis contribute to haem and iron overload in haemolytic patients. In all cohorts we observed increased systemic haem and iron levels associated with scavenger depletion and toxic 'free' species formation. Endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress and inflammation markers were significantly increased compared to healthy donors. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, oxidative stress markers remained significantly associated with both haem- and iron-related parameters, while soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (sVCAM-1), soluble endothelial selectin (sE-selectin) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) showed the strongest association with haem-related parameters and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (sICAM-1), sVCAM-1, interleukin 6 (IL-6) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) with iron-related parameters. While hereditary spherocytosis was associated with the highest IL-6 and TNFalpha levels, beta-thalassaemia major showed limited inflammation compared to SCD. The sVCAM1 increase was significantly lower in patients with SCD receiving exchange compared to simple transfusions. The present results support the involvement of free haem/iron species in the pathogenesis of vascular dysfunction and sterile inflammation in haemolytic diseases, irrespective of the underlying haemolytic mechanism, and highlight the potential therapeutic benefit of iron/haem scavenging therapies in these conditions.
32462740	Vitamin D supplementation for sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic chronic haemolytic and pro-inflammatory disorder. With increased catabolism and deficits in energy and nutrient intake, individuals with SCD suffer multiple macro- and micro-nutritional deficiencies, including vitamin D deficiency. This is an update of a previous review. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of vitamin D supplementation in children and adults with SCD and to compare different dose regimens. To determine the effects of vitamin D supplementation on general health (e.g. growth status and health-related quality of life), on musculoskeletal health (including bone mineral density, pain crises, bone fracture and muscle health), on respiratory health (including lung function, acute chest syndrome, acute exacerbation of asthma and respiratory infections) and the safety of vitamin D supplementation. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. Date of last search: 19 March 2020. We also searched database such as PubMed, clinical trial registries and the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Date of last search: 14 January 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing oral administration of any form of vitamin D supplementation at any dose and for any duration to another type or dose of vitamin D or placebo or no supplementation in people with SCD, of all ages, gender, and phenotypes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. They used the GRADE guidelines to assess the quality of the evidence. MAIN RESULTS: Vitamin D versus placebo One double-blind RCT (n = 39) compared oral vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) supplementation (20 participants) to placebo (19 participants) for six weeks. Only 25 participants completed the full six months of follow-up. The study had a high risk of bias due to incomplete outcome data, but a low risk of bias for randomisation, allocation concealment, blinding (of participants, personnel and outcome assessors) and selective outcome reporting; and an unclear risk of other biases. Vitamin D supplementation probably led to higher serum 25(OH)D levels at eight weeks, mean difference (MD) 29.79 (95% confidence interval (CI) 26.63 to 32.95); at 16 weeks, MD 12.67 (95% CI 10.43 to 14.90); and at 24 weeks, MD 15.52 (95% CI 13.50 to 17.54) (moderate-quality evidence). There was little or no difference in adverse events (tingling of lips or hands) between the vitamin D and placebo groups, risk ratio 3.16 (95% CI 0.14 to 72.84) (low-quality evidence). Vitamin D supplementation probably caused fewer pain days compared to the placebo group at eight weeks, MD -10.00 (95% CI -16.47 to -3.53) (low-quality evidence), but probably led to a lower (worse) health-related quality of life score (change from baseline in physical functioning PedsQL scores); at both 16 weeks, MD -12.56 (95% CI -16.44 to -8.69) and 24 weeks, MD -12.59 (95% CI -17.43 to -7.76), although this may not be the case at eight weeks (low-quality evidence). Vitamin D supplementation regimens compared Two double-blind RCTs (83 participants) compared different regimens of vitamin D. One RCT (n = 62) compared oral vitamin D3 7000 IU/day to 4000 IU/day for 12 weeks, while the second RCT (n = 21) compared oral vitamin D3 100,000 IU/month to 12,000 IU/month for 24 months. Both RCTs had low risk of bias for blinding (of participants, personnel and outcome assessors) and incomplete outcome data, but the risk of selective outcome reporting bias was high. The bias from randomisation and allocation concealment was low in one study but not in the second. There was an unclear risk of other biases. When comparing oral vitamin D 100,000 IU/month to 12,000 IU/month, the higher dose may have resulted in higher serum 25(OH)D levels at one year, MD 16.40 (95% CI 12.59 to 20.21) and at two years, MD 18.96 (95% CI 15.20 to 22.72) (low-quality evidence). There was little or no difference in adverse events between doses (low-quality evidence). There were more episodes of acute chest syndrome in the high-dose group, at one year, MD 0.27 (95% CI 0.02 to 0.52) but there was little or no difference at two years, MD 0.09 (95% CI -0.04 to 0.22) (moderate-quality evidence). At one year and two years there was also little or no difference between the doses in the presence of pain (moderate-quality evidence) or forced expiratory volume in one second % predicted. However, the high-dose group had lower values for % predicted forced vital capacity at both one and two years, MD -7.20% predicted (95% CI -14.15 to -0.25) and MD -7.10% predicted (95% CI -14.03 to -0.17), respectively. There were little or no differences between dose regimens in the muscle health of either hand or the dominant hand. The study comparing oral vitamin D3 7000 IU/day to 4000 IU/day (21 participants) did not provide data for analysis, but median serum 25(OH)D levels were reported to be lower in the low-dose group at both six and 12 weeks. At 12 weeks the median serum parathyroid hormone level was lower in the high-dose group. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We included three RCTs of varying quality. We consider that the current evidence presented in this review is not of sufficient quality to guide clinical practice. Until further evidence becomes available, clinicians should consider the relevant existing guidelines for vitamin D supplementation and dietary reference intakes for calcium and vitamin D. Well-designed RCTs of parallel design, are required to determine the effects and the safety of vitamin D supplementation as well as to assess the relative benefits of different doses in children and adults with SCD.
36400545	Allogeneic Transplant and Gene Therapy: Evolving Toward a Cure.	Curative therapies for sickle cell disease (SCD) include allogeneic human leukocyte antigen (HLA)- matched sibling and haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT), gene therapy, and gene editing. However, comparative trial data that might facilitate selecting one curative therapy over another are unavailable. New strategies to decrease graft rejection and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) risks are needed to expand haploidentical HCT. Myeloablative gene therapy and gene editing also has limitations. Herein, we review recent studies on curative therapies for SCD in the past 5 years.
38553339	The acute pain crisis in sickle cell disease: What can be done to improve outcomes?	The acute pain crisis (APC) is the commonest complication of sickle cell disease (SCD). Severe episodes may require treatment in hospital with strong opioid analgesic drugs, combined with additional supportive care measures. Guidelines for APC management have been produced over the past two decades gathering evidence from published studies, expert opinion, and patient perspective. Unfortunately, reports from multiple sources indicate that guidelines are often not followed, and that acute care in emergency departments and on acute medical wards is suboptimal. It is important to understand what leads to this breakdown in health care, and to identify evidence-based interventions which could be implemented to improve care. This review focuses on recently published articles as well as information about on-going clinical trials. Aspects of care which could potentially make a difference to patient experience include availability and accessibility of individual care plans agreed between patient and treating specialist, innovative means of delivering initial opioids to reduce time to first analgesia, and availability of a specialist unit away from the ED, where expert care can be delivered in a more compassionate environment. The current evidence of improved outcomes and health economic advantage with these interventions is inadequate, and this is hampering their implementation into health care systems.
33596221	Evidence-based interventions implemented in low-and middle-income countries for sickle cell disease management: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials.	BACKGROUND: Despite ~90% of sickle cell disease (SCD) occurring in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), the vast majority of people are not receiving evidence-based interventions (EBIs) to reduce SCD-related adverse outcomes and mortality, and data on implementation research outcomes (IROs) and SCD is limited. This study aims to synthesize available data on EBIs for SCD and assess IROs. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of RCTs reporting on EBIs for SCD management implemented in LMICs. We identified articles from PubMed/Medline, Global Health, PubMed Central, Embase, Web of Science medical subject heading (MeSH and Emtree) and keywords, published from inception through February 23, 2020, and conducted an updated search through December 24, 2020. We provide intervention characteristics for each study, EBI impact on SCD, and evidence of reporting on IROs. MAIN RESULTS: 29 RCTs were analyzed. EBIs identified included disease modifying agents, supportive care agents/analgesics, anti-malarials, systemic treatments, patient/ provider education, and nutritional supplements. Studies using disease modifying agents, nutritional supplements, and anti-malarials reported improvements in pain crisis, hospitalization, children's growth and reduction in severity and prevalence of malaria. Two studies reported on the sustainability of supplementary arginine, citrulline, and daily chloroquine and hydroxyurea for SCD patients. Only 13 studies (44.8%) provided descriptions that captured at least three of the eight IROs. There was limited reporting of acceptability, feasibility, fidelity, cost and sustainability. CONCLUSION: EBIs are effective for SCD management in LMICs; however, measurement of IROs is scarce. Future research should focus on penetration of EBIs to inform evidence-based practice and sustainability in the context of LMICs. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: This review is registered in PROSPERO #CRD42020167289.
38477912	Consequence of RBC Deformability On Heat Sink Effect of Blood in a Three Dimensional Bifurcated Vessel.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to analyze the effect of RBC shape and deformation on blood heat transfer of a tumor patient suffering from blood disorders when being treated with hyperthermia procedure. METHODS: Euler-Euler multiphase method along with granular model is used in this study to simulate blood flow in a bifurcated vessel. Kinetic theory is used to include particle nature of RBCs during blood flow in the current model. RESULTS: An increase of 0.25 K in blood temperature is noticed during a cardiac cycle for diseased patient compared to normal patient. These results indicate that blood disorders can alter the heat sink effect and blood heat transfer in a bifurcated vessel, which also affects the efficacy and efficiency of tumor treatment procedure. Hence, blood disorder (where the morphology of RBC is altered) of a patient needs to be taken into consideration when thermal therapy is being used for tumor treatment. CONCLUSION: Both spatial and transient Nusselt number of a normal patient is higher compared to a blood diseased patient which indicates a higher heat transfer in case of normal patient compared to the later, when treated with similar ablation procedure. So for a tumor patient suffering from blood disorder, modification in hyperthermia procedure needs to be done compared to a normal patient for complete infected cell necrosis and minimal destruction of healthy tissues.
33533039	Guideline on the peri-operative management of patients with sickle cell disease: Guideline from the Association of Anaesthetists.	Sickle cell disease is a multisystem disease characterised by chronic haemolytic anaemia, painful vaso-occlusive crises and acute and chronic end-organ damage. It is one of the most common serious inherited single gene conditions worldwide and has a major impact on the health of affected individuals. Peri-operative complications are higher in patients with sickle cell disease compared with the general population and may be sickle or non-sickle-related. Complications may be reduced by meticulous peri-operative care and transfusion, but unnecessary transfusion should be avoided, particularly to reduce the risk of allo-immunisation. Planned surgery and anaesthesia for patients with sickle cell disease should ideally be undertaken in centres with experience in caring for these patients. In an emergency, advice should be sought from specialists with experience in sickle cell disease through the haemoglobinopathy network arrangements. Emerging data suggest that patients with sickle cell disease are at increased risk of COVID-19 infection but may have a relatively mild clinical course. Outcomes are determined by pre-existing comorbidities, as for the general population.
36992422	Gene Therapy for beta-Hemoglobinopathies: From Discovery to Clinical Trials.	Investigations to understand the function and control of the globin genes have led to some of the most exciting molecular discoveries and biomedical breakthroughs of the 20th and 21st centuries. Extensive characterization of the globin gene locus, accompanied by pioneering work on the utilization of viruses as human gene delivery tools in human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HPSCs), has led to transformative and successful therapies via autologous hematopoietic stem-cell transplant with gene therapy (HSCT-GT). Due to the advanced understanding of the beta-globin gene cluster, the first diseases considered for autologous HSCT-GT were two prevalent beta-hemoglobinopathies: sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia, both affecting functional beta-globin chains and leading to substantial morbidity. Both conditions are suitable for allogeneic HSCT; however, this therapy comes with serious risks and is most effective using an HLA-matched family donor (which is not available for most patients) to obtain optimal therapeutic and safe benefits. Transplants from unrelated or haplo-identical donors carry higher risks, although they are progressively improving. Conversely, HSCT-GT utilizes the patient's own HSPCs, broadening access to more patients. Several gene therapy clinical trials have been reported to have achieved significant disease improvement, and more are underway. Based on the safety and the therapeutic success of autologous HSCT-GT, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2022 approved an HSCT-GT for beta-thalassemia (Zynteglo ). This review illuminates the beta-globin gene research journey, adversities faced, and achievements reached; it highlights important molecular and genetic findings of the beta-globin locus, describes the predominant globin vectors, and concludes by describing promising results from clinical trials for both sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia.
34002408	Screening for new red blood cell alloantibodies after transfusion in patients with sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) are frequent recipients of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions and are at risk for RBC alloimmunization. RBC alloimmunization is diagnosed by identifying RBC alloantibodies as part of pre-transfusion testing, but this testing fails to detect alloantibodies that have evanesced. It may be beneficial to screen for new RBC alloantibody development after transfusion before possible antibody evanescence. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Our institution started a new initiative for episodically transfused patients with SCD to obtain at least one antibody screen 2-6 months after transfusion as part of their clinical care. A database was created to prospectively track all transfused patients for 1 year and their post-transfusion antibody screen results. Patients received prophylactically CEK-matched RBC units. RESULTS: During the study year, 138 patients with SCD received a total of 242 RBC transfusions. Patients with a history of an RBC alloantibody (n = 13, 9.4%) had previously received more RBC units than non alloimmunized patients (median 11 vs. 2 RBC units, p = .0002). A total of 337 post-transfusion antibody screens were obtained in 127 patients (92.0%) with 110 patients (79.7%) having at least one antibody screen 2-6 months post-transfusion. With this prospective testing, two new RBC alloantibodies (anti-C and -M) were identified in two patients. CONCLUSION: It is feasible to test for new RBC alloantibody development in most episodically transfused patients with SCD as part of their routine care. The yield of this screening appears low with CEK matching, but it could still provide important information for individual patients.
32826064	An Interrupted Time Series Analysis of the Dissemination of a Sickle Cell Vaso-Occlusive Episode Treatment Algorithm and a Case Management Referral Form for Individuals With Sickle Cell Disease in the Emergency Department.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease is associated with frequent vaso-occlusive episode and emergency department visits. Our group developed (1) a vaso-occlusive episode treatment algorithm based on the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute recommendations, and (2) a case management referral form to identify social behavioral health needs of patients with sickle cell disease in the emergency department. The aims of this project were to (1) disseminate the vaso-occlusive episode algorithm and case management referral form, and (2) to evaluate the individual provider-reported awareness, use, and preferred method of access to each tool among emergency department providers in North Carolina. METHODS: An interrupted time series analysis was used to study the impact that an educational effort had on the awareness of a sickle cell vaso-occlusive episode treatment algorithm and a case management referral form. A targeted list was developed to identify the providers working in emergency departments with the largest number of sickle cell disease patient visits. In-service education was provided to targeted emergency departments in North Carolina over a period of 3 years. The vaso-occlusive episode algorithm and case management referral form were put up on the websites of professional organizations. Surveys were provided to emergency department providers at these targeted emergency departments with a baseline and post dissemination at 20 and 32 months for assessing the provider awareness, use, and preferred method of access of the tools. Additional feedback could be given by the participants through telephone interviews. Descriptive statistics were obtained, and content analysis was performed on interviews. RESULTS: We received survey responses for the following periods: baseline (T1, n = 190), post dissemination at 20 (T2, n = 142), and 32 months (T3, n = 93). Awareness of the tools was between 42% (baseline) and 41% (post dissemination at T2, T3) for the vaso-occlusive episodes algorithm and 25% (baseline) and 29% (post dissemination at T2, T3) for the case management referral form. However, use of these tools was found to be low as only 19% of the emergency department providers used the vaso-occlusive episode algorithm at T1 and 13% T2, while 5% of emergency department providers used the case management referral form at T1 and 6% at T2. With further education about the tools, an increase in the usage of the tools was observed T3, which was 29% for the vaso-occlusive episodes algorithm and 9% for the case management referral form. Lack of incorporation of the decision support tools into emergency department processes was observed to be an overarching barrier to dissemination of the tools identified in interviews (n = 8). CONCLUSIONS: This study can be used to inform future strategies on dissemination of evidence-based tools to emergency department providers.
33836866	Gaps in Medicaid Coverage and Financial Toxicity: A Health Disparity in Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation for Sickle Cell Disease.	
34981707	Liver Transplant in Hemoglobin SC Disease and Autoimmune Hepatitis: A Case Report.	Although liver transplant is a life-saving measure for individuals with end-stage liver disease, the perioperative management may be challenging in individuals with concomitant sickle cell disease. We report a case of a 50-year-old man with sickle cell disease genotype SC (HbSC) and cirrhosis secondary to autoimmune hepatitis who underwent liver transplant. His postoperative course included upper extremity deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, stroke via a patent foramen ovale after a line removal, and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. Fortunately, he is alive with a functioning graft at 10 months after liver transplant. This case highlights the feasibility of liver transplant in sickle cell disease given the support of meticulous multidisciplinary care and the unique aspects of autoimmune hepatitis and sickle cell disease for liver transplant consideration.
33836889	A Qualitative Analysis of State Medicaid Coverage Benefits for Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (alloHCT) for Patients with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD).	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common inherited hemoglobin disorder, affecting approximately 100,000 people in the United States. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT), also known as bone marrow transplant (BMT), is currently the only established curative option for SCD. However, alloHCT is an optional benefit under Medicaid. This study of alloHCT coverage for patients with SCD aims to understand the scope of state Medicaid coverage benefits and BMT financial coordinators' experience working with their state Medicaid programs. States estimated to have more than 50 newborns diagnosed with SCD in 2016 and at least one active BMT Clinical Trials Network (1503 [STRIDE 2], NCT02766465) transplant center (TC) were eligible to participate in this study. Qualitative, semi-structured interviews 30 to 60 minutes in length were conducted with BMT financial coordinators via telephone between May and October 2019. A total of 10 BMT financial coordinators from 10 TCs representing eight states (Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Michigan, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Virginia) participated in the semi-structured interviews. Coordinators in all of the included states reported that alloHCT in children with SCD with a human leukocyte antigen-matched sibling donor was covered by their state Medicaid programs. However, only two states (Florida and Texas) had legislative policies mandating coverage of routine medical costs for patients in clinical trials. TCs in two states (Illinois and Pennsylvania) reported accepting out-of-state Medicaid insurance, but only one state (Michigan) covered both travel and lodging for the patient and one caregiver. Four themes emerged when coordinators were asked about their perspectives and experiences working with their corresponding state Medicaid programs: (1) state Medicaid eligibility criteria based on disability were perceived as being restrictive, and Medicaid reimbursement rates were reported to be low; (2) Medicaid fee-for-service plans were perceived as being more comprehensive and easier to navigate compared to comprehensive managed care (CMC) plans; (3) there is a need to address caregiver and financial assistance beyond the health care costs; and (4) completing the insurance authorization process leading up to alloHCT is critical, including peer-to-peer reviews. There is limited legislative policy to help ensure access to clinical trials and provide out-of-state benefits and travel and lodging for Medicaid enrollees with SCD. These data provide insight into potential areas that could influence changes in policy to enhance access to curative therapy for SCD.
35986655	Doing more with less: Patient blood management meets sickle cell disease management.	
33275672	Optimizing the management of chronic pain in sickle cell disease.	Chronic pain in sickle cell disease (SCD) refers to pain present on most days lasting over six months. It can start during childhood and the prevalence increases with age. By adulthood, over 55% of patients experience pain on over 50% of days; 29% reporting pain on 95% of days. The true prevalence of chronic pain in SCD is likely underappreciated as it is mostly managed at home. Patients with chronic pain and SCD frequently seek acute care for exacerbation of underlying chronic pain difficult to distinguish from their usual acute vaso-occlusive crises. When treating chronic pain in SCD, the challenge is distinguishing between non-SCD related etiologies versus chronic pain resulting from SCD pathophysiological processes. This distinction is important to delineate as it will drive appropriate management strategies. Chronic pain in SCD has profound consequences for the patient; is often associated with comorbid psychiatric illnesses (depression and anxiety), not dissimilar from other chronic pain syndromes. They may also experience challenges with sleep hygiene, various somatic symptoms, and chronic fatigue that impair quality of life. How best to treat chronic pain in SCD is not definitively established. Both acute and chronic pain in SCD is typically treated with opioids. Emerging data suggests that chronic opioid therapy (COT) is a suboptimal treatment strategy for chronic pain. This review will discuss the complexity of managing chronic pain in SCD; pain that may be dependent or independent of the underlying SCD diagnosis. We will also describe alternative treatment approaches to high-dose COT.
34042406	Towards manufactured red blood cells for the treatment of inherited anemia.	Patients with inherited anemia and hemoglobinopathies (such as sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia) are treated with red blood cell (RBC) transfusions to alleviate their symptoms. Some of these patients may have rare blood group types or go on to develop alloimmune reactions, which can make it difficult to source compatible blood in the donor population. Laboratory-grown RBC represent a particularly attractive alternative which could satisfy an unmet clinical need. The challenge, however, is to produce - from a limited number of stem cells - the 2x1012 RBC required for a standard adult therapeutic dose. Encouraging progress has been made in RBC production from adult stem cells under good manufacturing practice. In 2011, the Douay group conducted a successful proof-of-principle mini-transfusion of autologous manufactured RBC in a single volunteer. In the UK, a trial is planned to assess whether manufactured RBC are equivalent to RBC produced naturally in donors, by testing an allogeneic mini-dose of laboratory-grown manufactured RBC in multiple volunteers. This review discusses recent progress in the erythroid culture field as well as opportunities for further scaling up of manufactured RBC production for transfusion practice.
33496753	A systematic review of quality of life in sickle cell disease and thalassemia after stem cell transplant or gene therapy.	Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and thalassemia experience several complications across their lifespan that lead to impairment in different health-related quality of life (HRQOL) domains. There is increasing interest in curative therapies for patients with SCD and thalassemia, including hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) and gene therapy; however, the effect of these therapies on various HRQOL domains remains unclear. Our objective was to systematically evaluate the most recent evidence for the effect of HSCT and gene therapy on HRQOL in patients with SCD and thalassemia. A systematic search of medical literature databases was conducted. A total of 16 studies (thalassemia, n = 9; SCD, n = 6; both, n = 1) involving 517 participants met inclusion criteria (thalassemia, n = 416; SCD, n = 101). HSCT was associated with a small to large positive effects in most HRQOL domains (Cohen's d; mean = 0.47; median = 0.37; range, 0.27-2.05). In thalassemia, HSCT was frequently associated with large positive effects in physical and emotional HRQOL domains (median d = 0.79 and d = 0.57, respectively). In SCD, HSCT was associated with large positive effects in all HRQOL domains. Emerging data suggest improvement in HRQOL outcomes across different domains following gene therapy in thalassemia and SCD. The quality of evidence was moderate in 13 studies (81%). HSCT has a positive impact on several HRQOL domains in patients with SCD and thalassemia; however, more longitudinal studies are warranted to assess the sustainability of these effects. Reporting HRQOL outcomes from ongoing gene therapy or gene-editing trials in SCD and thalassemia is key to better understand the benefits of such therapies.
32853076	Sickle Cell-Related Complications in Patients Undergoing Cardiopulmonary Bypass.	BACKGROUND: We aimed to describe our experience with patients with sickle cell trait (SCT) and undergoing surgery on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). METHODS: Data on all patients with SCT or sickle-alpha thalassemia who underwent surgery on CPB were collected (1996-2017). RESULTS: Overall, 46 patients were included, 37 (80%) had SCT and 9 (20%) had sickle-alpha thalassemia. A total of 4 (9%) developed a potential sickle cell-related complication. Patients with sickle cell-related complications were significantly older (median 14 years vs 14 months, P = .037) and heavier (median 54 kg vs 9 kg, P = .041). Complications occurred, although without statistical significance, in patients who underwent longer median CPB times (249 minutes vs 137 minutes, P = .069), lower median temperature (31.7  C vs 33.3  C, P = .094), and a higher percentage underwent deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (50% vs 7%, P = .053). A total of 30 (65%) patients underwent exchange transfusion (ET) pre-bypass. Patients who underwent ET were significantly older (median 4 years vs 7 months, P = .003) and heavier (median 16 kg vs 6 kg, P = .015) than patients who did not undergo ET. The incidence of complications was comparable between patients who underwent ET (10%) and those who did not (6%). CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective, single-center study, it has been shown that cardiac surgery requiring CPB in patients with SCT and sickle-alpha thalassemia had a low risk for sickle cell-associated complications. In this cohort of patients, older age, longer CPB times, lower median temperature, and the utilization of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest appear to play an important role in the development of complications.

32448738	A Healthcare Improvement Initiative to Increase Multidisciplinary Pain Management Referrals for Youth with Sickle Cell Disease.	BACKGROUND: Chronic pain is a complex integration of biological, psychological, and social variables. Multidisciplinary pain management experts design interventions that treat the multidimensional experience. Children and adolescents with sickle cell disease (SCD) are at risk for chronic pain. Increased risk is associated with multiple characteristics including sickle cell genotype, age, gender, frequency of hospitalization, duration of hospitalization, and certain comorbid diagnoses. Referral to pain management professionals for this population is often delayed. AIMS: To increase multidisciplinary pain management referrals for youth with SCD identified to be at risk for chronic pain. DESIGN: Implementation research. SETTING: One pediatric, academic medical facility serving as a regional sickle cell treatment center in the Midwest. PARTICIPANTS: Children greater than 2 years of age and less than 21 years of age with laboratory confirmed SCD. METHODS: Implementation of an evidence-based screening tool using the consolidated framework for implementation research (CFIR) to guide project planning, design, and evaluation. The CFIR model was paired with the Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) quality improvement methodology to operationalize workflow and sustain project aims. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Eighty-four percent of all eligible patients were screened during their routine sickle cell appointments resulting in a 110% increase in multidisciplinary pain management referrals. Future interventions and PDSA cycles are targeted at improving attendance at scheduled appointments, reducing hospitalizations, decreasing 30-day readmissions, and shortening length of stay.
32621039	Prognostic value of left ventricular longitudinal strain by speckle-tracking echocardiography in patients with sickle cell disease.	Cardiovascular complications have been increasingly detected in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Two-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography (STE) detects early myocardial changes in a number of pathophysiological processes, which may be useful in SCD. This study was designed to examine the value of STE in predicting clinical outcome in adult patients with SCD. A total of 219 patients, mean age 33 +- 12 years were prospectively enrolled. Several clinical, laboratory and echocardiographic variables including left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LVGLS) by STE were assessed. The endpoint was a composite of the following events: (1) all-cause mortality, (2) three or more acute painful episodes that require hospitalization in one year, (3) acute chest syndrome and (4) hospitalization due to disease complication. The majority of the patients had enlargement of LV and left atrial (LA) with preserved ejection fraction. During the mean follow-up of 30 months, 69 patients (32%) had reached the endpoint, including eight deaths (3.7%). No difference was observed in the parameters of diastolic function comparing the patients with and without events. LVGLS ranged from - 12.25 to - 25.44 (mean - 20.26 +- 2.5), with higher values in the patients who had events compared with those who did not. In the multivariable analysis, higher LVGLS values were associated with adverse events (adjusted OR 1.25; 95% CI 1.04-1.51; p = 0.021), independently of the TR maximal velocity and LV ejection fraction. In patients with SCD, higher LV global longitudinal strain was a predictor of adverse outcome, independently of age, TR velocity and LV function.
36120980	Rates of Opioid Misuse Amongst Patients Receiving Pain Management for Sickle Cell Disease in An Urban Setting.	Background and Objective: Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is known to cause acute severe pain episodes known as vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) mainly treated with opioid analgesics. Since the opioid epidemic there is an interest in determining the opioid misuse potential in these patients. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to determine the rates of opioid misuse among patients with SCD by assessing the rate of unexpected drug screening results in a sickle cell disease clinic. Methods: This was a retrospective chart review study conducted at the outpatient sickle cell disease clinic. The primary independent variables were the prescribed opioid medications while the primary dependent variable was the collected opioid metabolite. Descriptive statistics, linear regression and multivariate logistic regression analysis were conducted using SPSS version 24. Results: A total of 100 participants were recruited from July 1, 2018, to June 30, 2020 with 71 included in the analysis. The total mean of morphine milligram equivalents (MME) for all participants was 71.1+-104.9 with 71% of participants having a daily calculated MME of <90MME. The odds of misusing an opioid were 6.72 times higher (P<.02) if a participant used marijuana compared to a participant who didn't. In addition, the odds of misusing an opioid were 2.47 times higher (P<.04) if the patient was prescribed an opioid daily dose greater than 90 MME as opposed to a daily dose less than 90 MME. Conclusion: Participants who consumed greater than 90 MME's per day and utilized marijuana were more likely to misuse opioids.
32586619	Parents of Children with Sickle Cell Disease Are Interested in Preimplantation Genetic Testing.	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate awareness of and attitudes toward preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) for sickle cell disease (SCD) among parents of children with SCD. STUDY DESIGN: Parents of children with SCD were given an educational handbook on PGT before a routine SCD clinic visit. After their clinic visit, parents were asked to complete an anonymous survey. RESULTS: Of 83 patents approached, 67 (81%) completed the survey. Only 16 of the 67 parents (24%) were previously aware of PGT for SCD. After our clinic-based education, 65 of the 67 parents (97%) indicated that it was important or very important for parents of children with SCD to know about PGT. Among parents interested in having more children, 29 of 32 (91%) would personally consider using PGT if covered by insurance. CONCLUSIONS: Parents of children with SCD are generally not aware of PGT. When educated in clinic, parents viewed information on PGT as valuable. Pediatricians and other health care professionals should inform parents of children with SCD about this reproductive option.
32894002	Practice patterns for neuroimaging and transfusion therapy for management of neurologic complications in sickle cell anemia: DISPLACE consortium.	BACKGROUND: Children with sickle cell anemia (SCA) are at risk for neurologic complications (stroke and silent cerebral infarct). The 2014 National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) guidelines for sickle cell disease include recommendations for initiation and maintenance of chronic red cell transfusion (CRCT) therapy for children with SCA at risk for or with ischemic stroke. The guidelines do not include well-delineated recommendations for cerebral imaging for stroke screening. The purpose of this study was to evaluate current stroke risk screening, prevention, and intervention practices amongst the Dissemination and Implementation of Stroke Prevention Looking at the Care Environment (DISPLACE) study sites. PROCEDURE: A survey was administered to DISPLACE site principal investigators to identify current stroke prevention practices relative to the Stroke Prevention Trial in Sickle Cell Anemia (STOP) study protocols and the 2014 NHLBI guidelines. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and line-by-line analysis of comments. RESULTS: Sites consistently applied NHLBI recommendations to initiate CRCT for ischemic stroke and abnormal transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) results. Similarly, nearly all sites reported obtaining an magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) following an abnormal TCD result. There was wide variation for other indications for MRI/MRA, frequency of MRI/MRA, and other neurological indications for initiating CRCT. CONCLUSIONS: Guideline-based practices for preventing ischemic stroke through TCD and CRCT initiation were evident in nearly all sites. Wide variation in practices pertaining to MRI/MRA exists, potentially influenced by more recent stroke prevention trials. New guidelines from the American Society of Hematology were published in April 2020, which may reduce practice variation.
32089275	Sickle Cell Disease is Associated with Increased Morbidity, Resource Utilization, and Readmissions after Common Abdominal Surgeries: A Multistate Analysis, 2007-2014.	INTRODUCTION: Sickle cell disease (SCD), the most commonly inherited hemoglobinopathy in the United States, increases the likelihood of postoperative complications, resulting in higher costs and readmissions. We used a retrospective cohort study to explore SCD's influence on postoperative complications and readmissions after cholecystectomy, appendectomy, and hysterectomy. METHODS: We used an administrative database's 2007-2014 data from California, Florida, New York, Maryland, and Kentucky. RESULTS: 1,934,562 patients aged >=18 years were included. Compared to non-SCD patients, SCD patients experienced worse outcomes: increased odds of blood transfusion and major and minor complications, higher adjusted odds of 30- and 90-day readmissions, longer length of stay, and higher total hospital charges. CONCLUSION: Sickle cell disease patients are at high risk for poor outcomes based on their demographic characteristics. Therefore, perioperative physicians including hematologists, anesthesiologists, and surgeons need to take this knowledge into consideration for management and counselling of SCD patients on the risks of surgery and recovery.

32283959	Veno-Venous Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation in Adult Patients with Sickle Cell Disease and Acute Chest Syndrome: a Single-Center Experience.	Acute chest syndrome (ACS) in adult patients with sickle cell disease represents a leading cause of death. It is characterized by a new density on chest X-ray accompanied by fever and/or respiratory symptoms. Currently, 49 adult patients with sickle cell disease are registered at our department. By now, 12 patients (24.5%) suffered from ACS and two patients showed multiple/recurrent (>2) episodes. Death in one patient was related to acute respiratory failure secondary to ACS. In three patients with ACS, invasive mechanical ventilation and subsequent veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) was mandatory. Veno-venous ECMO was applied within 24 hours upon arrival to the intensive care unit (ICU). All patients were treated aggressively for ACS including exchange transfusions [packed red blood cell (pRBC) units 5-16] maintaining a Hb S threshold of <30.0% in addition to broad-spectrum antibiotics, resulting in a successful outcome following decannulation from VV-ECMO (49 hours, 251 hours, 30 min., and 98 hours, respectively). Limited information is presently available on the use of VV-ECMO in adult patients with sickle cell disease in the context of acute respiratory failure secondary to ACS. The adequate timing of the decision to place ECMO in critically ill adults with sickle cell disease, incapable of being treated by conventional mechanical ventilation secondary to very severe vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC), might further reduce mortality rates while treating the underlying condition.

35973707	Inpatient palliative care use by patients with sickle cell disease: a retrospective cross-sectional study.	OBJECTIVE: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a highly morbid condition notable for recurrent hospitalisations due to vaso-occlusive crises and complications of end organ damage. Little is known about the use of inpatient palliative care services in adult patients with SCD. This study aims to evaluate inpatient palliative care use during SCD-related hospitalisations overall and during terminal hospitalisations. We hypothesise that use of palliative care is low in SCD hospitalisations. DESIGN: A retrospective cross-sectional study using data from the National Inpatient Sample from 2008 to 2017 was conducted. SETTING: US hospitals from 47 states and the District of Columbia. PARTICIPANTS: Patients >18 years old hospitalised with a primary or secondary International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) or ICD-10-CM diagnosis of SCD were included. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Palliative care service use (documented by ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes V66.7 and Z51.5). RESULTS: 987 555 SCD-related hospitalisations were identified, of which 4442 (0.45%) received palliative care service. Palliative care service use increased at a rate of 9.2% per year (95% CI 5.6 to 12.9). NH-black and Hispanic patients were 33% and 53% less likely to have palliative care services compared with NH-white patients (OR 0.67; 95% CI 0.45 to 0.99 and OR 0.47; 95% CI 0.26 to 0.84). Female patients (OR 0.40; 95% CI 0.21 to 0.76), Medicaid use (OR 0.40; 95% CI 0.21 to 0.78), rural (OR 0.47; 95% CI 0.28 to 0.79) and urban non-teaching hospitals (OR 0.61; 95% CI 0.47 to 0.80) each had a lower likelihood of palliative care services use. CONCLUSION: Use of palliative care during SCD-related hospitalisations is increasing but remains low. Disparities associated with race and gender exist for use of palliative care services during SCD-related hospitalisation. Further studies are needed to guide evidence-based palliative care interventions for more comprehensive and equitable care of adult patients with SCD.
37227254	An innovative intervention for the prevention of vaso-occlusive episodes in sickle cell disease.	OBJECTIVES: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is characterized by a mutation in the beta-globin gene resulting in abnormal hemoglobin S (HgbS). The significant sequela of SCD include anemia and recurrent vaso-occlusive episodes (VOEs) which may effectuate patients to receive chronic blood transfusions. Current pharmacotherapy options for SCD include hydroxyurea, voxelotor, Lglutamine, and crizanlizumab. Simple and exchange transfusions are often utilized as prophylaxis to prevent emergency department (ED)/urgent care (UC) visits or hospitalizations from VOEs by reducing the level of sickled red blood cells (RBCs). In addition, the treatment of VOEs involves intravenous (IV) hydration and pain management. Studies have demonstrated that sickle cell infusion centers (SCIC) decrease hospital admissions for VOEs, and IV hydration and pain medications are the key components of management employed. Thus, we hypothesized that implementing a structured infusion protocol in the outpatient setting would reduce the incidence of VOEs. METHODS: Here, we discuss two patients with SCD who were trialed on scheduled outpatient IV hydration and opioids with the goal of decreasing the frequency of VOEs in the setting of the current blood product shortage and the patients' refusal to receive exchange transfusions. RESULTS: Overall, the two patients had opposing outcomes- one demonstrated reduced frequency of VOEs, whereas the other had mixed results due to noncompliance to scheduled outpatient sessions. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: The use of outpatient SCICs may be an effective intervention for prevention of VOEs in patients with SCD, and further patient-centered research and quality improvement initiatives are needed to further quantify and understand the factors contributing to their efficacy.
32030737	Regulation of iron homeostasis through the erythroferrone-hepcidin axis in sickle cell disease.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) has a distinct pattern of transfusional iron overload (IO) when compared to transfusion-dependent beta-thalassaemia major (TDT). We conducted a single institution prospective study to evaluate plasma biomarkers of iron regulation and inflammation in patients with SCD with IO (SCD IO cases, n = 22) and without IO (SCD non-IO cases, n = 11), and non-SCD controls (n = 13). Hepcidin was found to be inappropriately low, as evidenced by a significantly higher median hepcidin/ferritin ratio in non-SCD controls compared to SCD IO cases (0 3 vs. 0 02, P < 0 0001) and SCD non-IO cases (0 3 vs. 0 02, P < 0 0001), suggesting that certain inhibitory mechanism (s) work to suppress hepcidin in SCD. As opposed to the SCD non-IO state, where hepcidin shows a strong significant positive correlation with ferritin (Spearman rho = 0 7, P = 0 02), this correlation was lost when IO occurs (Spearman rho = -0 2, P = 0 4). Although a direct non-linear correlation between erythroferrone (ERFE) and hepcidin did not reach statistical significance both in the IO (Spearman rho = -0 4, P = 0 08) and non-IO state (Spearman rho = -0 6, P = 0 07), patients with highest ERFE had low hepcidin levels, suggesting that ERFE contributes to hepcidin regulation in some patients. Our results suggest a multifactorial mechanism of hepcidin regulation in SCD.
31688630	The Adolescent and Caregiver Sickle Cell Disease Self-management Skills Checklist: Preliminary Reliability and Validity.	Adolescents with sickle cell disease (SCD) need assistance in developing the knowledge and skills that contribute to increased disease self-management and successful transition to adult-based health care. This study evaluated the preliminary psychometric properties of the Self-Management Skills Checklist (SMSC and SMSC-C; Adolescent and Caregiver versions), a measure of perceived SCD-specific knowledge and skills. A retrospective cohort study included 114 adolescents (mean=15.6 y) and their caregivers. We examined internal structure and reliability, score changes over time, and group differences. Cronbach coefficient alphas were 0.79 and 0.74 for caregiver-reported Skills and caregiver-reported knowledge, respectively, and 0.77 and 0.44 for adolescent-reported skills and adolescent-reported knowledge, respectively, indicating good internal consistency for 3 of the subscales. Poor reliability in the adolescent-reported knowledge summary score and factor analysis suggest an interpretation item-by-item, independent of one another. Participant group differences in age and chronic transfusion treatment existed in both summary and subscale scores of the SMSC and SMSC-C. Follow-up administrations of the scales indicated an increase in caregiver-reported skills for their adolescents from time 1 scores (M=3.72+-0.83) to time 2 scores (M=3.99+-0.63) (t16=2.178, P=0.045). Findings provide preliminary support for the usage of the SMSC and continued development to improve its psychometrics.
32789419	Incidence of sickle cell disease patients with pulmonary embolism admitted to the intensive care unit in Bahrain.	OBJECTIVES: To describe the incidence of pulmonary embolism (PE) in sickle cell disease (SCD) patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: A retrospective descriptive analysis was conducted with 124 SCD patients diagnosed with PE or suspected PE admitted to the ICU of Salmaniya Medical Complex, Manama, Bahrain between May 2017 and April 2018. A data collection form was used to obtain information on the history and demographics of PE patients. RESULTS: A total of 124 patients diagnosed with SCD were admitted to the ICU during the study period. Male patients slightly outnumbered (n=75; 56.4%) female patients, and the average age was in the mid- thirties (mean=37.4 years). The main diagnosis leading to ICU admission was vaso-occlusive crisis. The average hemoglobin level was 8.6 mg/dl, hemoglobin S% was 55.8%, and the length of stay in the ICU was 5.3 days. A total of 5 patients were diagnosed with PE with an incidence rate of 3.8%. All PE patients were females, which resulted in a significant relationship between gender and the likelihood of developing PE. No statistical relationship existed between the likelihood of developing PE and patient age, hemoglobin, hemoglobin S%, length of stay in ICU, and mortality. CONCLUSION: The demographic characteristics of the population included a male predominance, age in the mid-thirties, and vaso-occlusive crisis diagnosis upon admission to the ICU. The incidence of PE was significantly related to female gender. No significant relationship existed between the likelihood of developing PE and age, hemoglobin, hemoglobin S%, length of ICU stay, or mortality.
32157246	The role of HLA matching in unrelated donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for sickle cell disease in Europe.	We report the results of an analysis of unrelated allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantations (HSCT) in 71 patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) transplanted in EBMT centers between 2005 and 2017. Median age was 9.3 years; graft type was bone marrow in 79% and peripheral blood in 21%. Recipient-donor HLA match at high resolution typing was 10/10 in 31, 9/10 in 20, and 8/10 in 4 patients; the other patients had intermediate resolution typing. The most frequent conditioning regimens were fludarabine-thiotepa-treosulfan (64%) or busulfan-cyclophosphamide (12%). Cumulative incidence of neutrophil engraftment was 92%; platelet engraftment was 90%. Eleven patients (15%) experienced graft failure. Grade II-IV acute graft-vs.-host disease (GvHD) was 23%; 3-year chronic GvHD was 23%. Three-year overall survival (OS) was 88 +- 4%. GRFS was 62 +- 6%. HLA matching was the most significant risk factor for OS: 3-year OS was 96 +- 4% in 10/10 group vs. 75 +- 10% in 9-8/10 (p = 0.042); GRFS was 69 +- 9% vs. 50 +- 12% (p = 0.114), respectively. In conclusion, unrelated donor HSCT is a valid option for SCD patients who lack an HLA-identical sibling donor, preferably in the context of clinical trials. Using a 10/10 HLA-matched unrelated donor yields better survival indicating that HLA matching is an important donor selection factor in this nonmalignant disease.
34389516	Transition Navigator Intervention Improves Transition Readiness to Adult Care for Youth With Sickle Cell Disease.	OBJECTIVE: Adolescents and young adults (AYA) with sickle cell disease (SCD) experience high rates of acute care utilization and increased morbidity. At this high-risk time, they also face the need to transition from pediatric to adult services, which, if poorly coordinated, adds to heightened morbidity and acute care utilization. The study objective was to characterize the feasibility, acceptability, and short-term efficacy of a protocolized transition navigator (TN) intervention in AYA with SCD. METHODS: We developed a protocolized TN intervention that used ecological assessment and motivational interviewing to assess transition readiness, identify goals, and remove barriers to transition, and to provide disease and pain management education and skills to AYAs with SCD. RESULTS: Ninety-three percent (56/60) of enrolled individuals completed the intervention. Participation in the TN program was associated with significant improvement in mean transition readiness scores (3.58-4.15, P < .0001), disease knowledge scale (8.91-10.13, P < .0001), Adolescent Medication Barriers Scale (40.05-35.39, P = .003) and confidence in both disease (22.5-23.96, P = .048) and pain management (25.07-26.61, P = .003) for youth with SCD. CONCLUSION: The TN intervention was acceptable to youth with SCD, feasible to implement at an urban academic medical center, and addressed barriers to transition identified by the youth. Longer-term assessment is needed to determine if the TN intervention improved successful transfer to and retention in adult care.
37939877	Sickle cell disease and pregnancy.	Pregnancy is a particularly risky period in the life of patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Physiological changes during pregnancy increase the risk of vaso-occlusive crises (VOC), acute chest syndrome, venous thromboembolic events, and infections. This concerns haemoglobin (Hb) S/C and S/beta+-thalassaemia patients as much than S/S or S/beta0-thalassaemia patients. SCD also increases the risk of obstetrical complications, such as preeclampsia, in utero foetal death, preterm delivery mostly induced, and intrauterine growth restriction. Thus, pregnancy should be planned and closely monitored by a multidisciplinary team involving obstetricians and sickle cell disease specialists. Before pregnancy, the parents should also be informed about the risk of transmission of this autosomal recessive disease, and the father should therefore be prescribed haemoglobin electrophoresis. Treatments have to be revised when planning pregnancy: hydroxyurea (HU) should be stopped as soon as pregnancy is suspected or confirmed. Preventive blood transfusion is not systematic, but is recommended in the case of a pre-existing transfusion program prior to pregnancy, severe pre-existing organ damage, severe obstetric history, and severe or repeated crises during follow-up, especially in patients taking HU before. Despite the risks of prematurity, systematic administration of corticosteroids for foetal lung maturation is not recommended due to the risk of maternal vaso-occlusive event. Although more frequent, due to obstetrical and maternal complications, caesarean section is not systematic, in the absence of maternal contraindications. It is advisable not to exceed the term of 39 weeks of amenorrhoea. Post-partum follow-up is recommended, particularly because of the risk of thromboembolism.
32367178	Outcomes related to intravenous fluid administration in sickle cell patients during vaso-occlusive crisis.	While fluid replacement therapy is a primary treatment modality used in vaso-occlusive crises for sickle cell disease, data is limited on its safety, efficacy, and variability. We performed a retrospective analysis on 157 unique patient encounters from 49 sickle cell patients hospitalized with a vaso-occlusive episode at our institution from 2013 to 2017. The median length of hospital stay was 4 days (IQR 2-7). The mean total amount of intravenous fluid administered during the hospitalization was 7.4 L (Std 9.6). The mean total amount of fluid intake including intravenous fluids, blood transfusions, and oral fluids was 14.2 L (Std 18.2). Multivariate analyses revealed significant associations between the development of any adverse event (including a new oxygen requirement, acute chest syndrome, aspiration event, other hospital-acquired infection, acute kidney injury, and intensive care unit transfer) and the following variables: intravenous fluid administered in the first 24 h (p = 0.001, OR 1.899, 95% CI 1.319-2.733), total amount of intravenous fluid administered (p = 0.005, OR 1.081, 95% CI 1.023-1.141), and total amount of fluid intake including oral fluids, blood transfusions, and intravenous fluids (p = 0.009, OR 1.046, 95% CI 1.011-1.081). Other factors found to be significantly associated with any adverse event were dialysis dependence prior to admission (p < 0.001, OR 12.984, 95% CI 3.660-46.056) and admission to an inpatient service versus an emergency room or observation unit (p = 0.008, OR 3.201, 95% CI 1.346-7.612). While fluid administration may theoretically slow the sickling process, this data suggests that fluid administration during a vaso-occlusive episode, and especially total volume given in the first 24 h, may also lead to adverse events.

34396933	Refractory acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura in a patient with sickle cell trait successfully treated with caplacizumab.	Methods: We report a case of a 20-year-old Nigerian male who presented with acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (aTTP) and sickle cell trait. The coexistence of published cases of TTP and sickle cell hemoglobinopathies is rare.Results: Despite the initial treatment with plasma exchange and glucocorticoids, our patient relapsed and also required caplacizumab which resulted in successful remission.Discussion: We conclude by reviewing the cases of TTP in patients with sickle cell hemoglobinopathies and review how vaso-occlusive crises with multiorgan injury can mimic TTP.Conclusion: Ours is the first published case of aTTP with confirmed ADAMTS13 autoantibodies in a patient with a sickle cell hemoglobinopathy and contributes to the literature on the successful use of caplacizumab in clinical practice.
36191299	Subanesthetic ketamine: the way forward for pain management in sickle cell disease patients?	INTRODUCTION: Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) present recurrent episodes of acute pain, the hallmark of the disease, and some will also develop chronic pain. Currently, the treatment of SCD acute pain only targets its symptoms, rather than underlying mechanisms, and is directed by expert and consensus guidelines. AREAS COVERED: While opioids remain the mainstay of therapy for acute pain and are also used to treat SCD-related chronic pain, in some patients, opioids are ineffective or are associated with severe undesirable side effects. In those instances, clinicians caring for patients with SCD face an unmet need for effective non-opioid analgesics. Recently, the use of subanesthetic ketamine has been explored as a strategy to meet this need. While definitive evidence of its efficacy is lacking, some information exists suggesting that subanesthetic ketamine improves pain control and may have opioid-sparing effects in SCD-related acute pain. However, ketamine can also yield undesirable psychotomimetic and cardiovascular effects. EXPERT OPINION: After weighing potential risks and benefits, in the absence of better alternatives and in settings where it can be administered safely, ketamine may be a reasonable option for patients with SCD-related acute refractory pain.
33240273	How Ancestry Influences the Chances of Finding Unrelated Donors: An Investigation in Admixed Brazilians.	A match of HLA loci between patients and donors is critical for successful hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. However, the extreme polymorphism of HLA loci - an outcome of millions of years of natural selection - reduces the chances that two individuals will carry identical combinations of multilocus HLA genotypes. Further, HLA variability is not homogeneously distributed throughout the world: African populations on average have greater variability than non-Africans, reducing the chances that two unrelated African individuals are HLA identical. Here, we explore how self-identification (often equated with "ethnicity" or "race") and genetic ancestry are related to the chances of finding HLA compatible donors in a large sample from Brazil, a highly admixed country. We query REDOME, Brazil's Bone Marrow Registry, and investigate how different criteria for identifying ancestry influence the chances of finding a match. We find that individuals who self-identify as "Black" and "Mixed" on average have lower chances of finding matches than those who self-identify as "White" (up to 57% reduction). We next show that an individual's African genetic ancestry, estimated using molecular markers and quantified as the proportion of an individual's genome that traces its ancestry to Africa, is strongly associated with reduced chances of finding a match (up to 60% reduction). Finally, we document that the strongest reduction in chances of finding a match is associated with having an MHC region of exclusively African ancestry (up to 75% reduction). We apply our findings to a specific condition, for which there is a clinical indication for transplantation: sickle-cell disease. We show that the increased African ancestry in patients with this disease leads to reduced chances of finding a match, when compared to the remainder of the sample, without the condition. Our results underscore the influence of ancestry on chances of finding compatible HLA matches, and indicate that efforts guided to increasing the African component of registries are necessary.
33516678	Linkage to Care Intervention to Improve Post-Hospital Outcomes Among Children with Sickle Cell Disease in Tanzania: A Pilot Study.	We conducted a pilot study to determine the effectiveness of a linkage to care intervention with social workers to improve 12-month post-hospital mortality for children in Tanzania with sickle cell disease. Comparison was done with a historical cohort. Mortality was 6.7% in the interventional cohort compared with 19.2% (adjusted Hazard Ratio, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.08-0.83).
34998394	Cost analysis of acute care resource utilization among individuals with sickle cell disease in a middle-income country.	BACKGROUND: The costs associated with the treatment of sickle cell disease (SCD) are understudied in low and middle-income countries (LMIC). We evaluated the cost of treating SCD-related acute complications and the potential cost-savings of hydroxyurea in a specialized hematology center in Brazil. METHODS: The costs (US dollars) of emergency department (ED) and hospitalizations from SCD-related complications between 01.01.2018 and 06.30.2018 were ascertained using absorption and micro-costing approaches. The reasons for acute hospital visits were grouped as: 1) vaso-occlusive (VOC) pain, 2) infection, 3) anemia exacerbation, and 4) chronic organ damage complications. Hydroxyurea adherence was estimated by medication possession ratio (MPR) during the study period. RESULTS: In total, 1144 patients, median age 17 years (range 0-70), 903 (78.9%) with HbSS/HbSbeta0-thalassemia, 441 (38.5%) prescribed hydroxyurea, visited the ED, of whom 381 (33%) were admitted. VOC accounted for 64% of all ED visits and 60% of all admissions. Anemia exacerbation was the most expensive reason for ED visit ($321.87/visit), while chronic organ damage carried the highest admission cost ($2176.40/visit). Compared with other genotypes, individuals with HbSS/HbSbeta0-thalassemia were admitted more often (79% versus 21%, p < 0.0001), and their admission costs were higher ($1677.18 versus $1224.47/visit, p = 0.0001). Antibiotics and analgesics accounted for 43% and 42% of the total ED costs, respectively, while housing accounted for 46% of the total admission costs. Costs of ED visits not resulting in admissions were lower among HbSS/HbSbeta0-thalassemia individuals with hydroxyurea MPR >=65% compared with visits by patients with MPR <65% ($98.16/visit versus $182.46/visit, p = 0.0007). No difference in admission costs were observed relative to hydroxyurea use. DISCUSSION: In a LMIC hematology-specialized center, VOCs accounted for most acute visits from patients with SCD, but costs were highest due to anemia exacerbation. Analgesics, antibiotics, and housing drove most expenses. Hydroxyurea may reduce ED costs among individuals with HbSS/HbSbeta0-thalassemia but is dependent on adherence level.
32312326	Serial prophylactic exchange blood transfusion in pregnant women with sickle cell disease (TAPS-2): study protocol for a randomised controlled feasibility trial.	BACKGROUND: Pregnancies in women with sickle cell disease (SCD) are associated with a higher risk of sickle and pregnancy complications. Limited options exist for treating SCD during pregnancy. Serial prophylactic exchange blood transfusion (SPEBT) has been shown to be effective in treating SCD outside pregnancy, but evidence is lacking regarding its use during pregnancy. The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of conducting a future phase 3 randomised controlled trial (RCT) to establish the clinical and cost effectiveness of SPEBT in pregnant women with SCD. METHODS: The study is an individually randomised, two-arm, feasibility trial with embedded qualitative and health economic studies. Fifty women, 18 years of age and older, with SCD and a singleton pregnancy at <= 18 weeks' gestation will be recruited from six hospitals in England. Randomisation will be conducted using a secure online database and minimised by centre, SCD genotype and maternal age. Women allocated to the intervention arm will receive SPEBT commencing at <= 18 weeks' gestation, performed using automated erythrocytapheresis every 6-10 weeks until the end of pregnancy, aiming to maintain HbS% or combined HbS/HbC% below 30%. Women in the standard care arm will only receive transfusion when clinically indicated. The primary outcome will be the recruitment rate. Additional endpoints include reasons for refusal to participate, attrition rate, protocol adherence, and maternal and neonatal outcomes. Women will be monitored throughout pregnancy to assess maternal, sickle, and foetal complications. Detailed information about adverse events (including hospital admission) and birth outcomes will be extracted from medical records and via interview at 6 weeks postpartum. An embedded qualitative study will consist of interviews with (a) 15-25 trial participants to assess experiences and acceptability, (b) 5-15 women who decline to participate to identify barriers to recruitment and (c) 15-20 clinical staff to explore fidelity and acceptability. A health economic study will inform a future cost effectiveness and cost-utility analysis. DISCUSSION: This feasibility study aims to rigorously evaluate SPEBT as a treatment for SCD in pregnancy and its impact on maternal and infant outcomes. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NIH registry (www.clinicaltrials.gov), registration number NCT03975894 (registered 05/06/19); ISRCTN (www.isrctn.com), registration number ISRCTN52684446 (retrospectively registered 02/08/19).
34983921	Delayed Hemolytic Transfusion Reaction in Sickle Cell Disease: A Case Series.	BACKGROUND Transfusion therapy has a well-established role in the management of several sickle cell disease (SCD)-related complications. Nevertheless, the benefits of transfusion must outweigh the possible risks, including iron overload, infections, and transfusion reactions. Alloimmunization is the underlying etiology of most delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions (DHTR). DHTR is often underestimated and underdiagnosed in sickle cell disease patients as it mimics a vaso-occlusive crisis in presentation. Alloimmunization to RBC antigens can be a serious complication of transfusion, which is of particular interest in individuals with SCD, as the occurrence rate is higher in this population. This complication represents a secondary immunological phenomenon that typically arises after the emergence of an alloantibody to which the patient had been previously sensitized to. CASE REPORT Here, we report 2 cases of delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction (DHTR) in which the patients showed evidence of alloimmunization from previous blood transfusions. The patients were managed with a variety of medications, including supportive treatments, utilization of immunosuppressive agents, and enhancement of erythropoiesis. Both patients had evidence of clinical and laboratory improvement following the management. CONCLUSIONS DHTR is considered one of the most deleterious complications of transfusion in SCD patients. The diagnosis and management of DHTR is very challenging, especially because it can present differently in this population. A high index of clinical suspicion is needed in addition to the laboratory criteria.
37399057	Sickle cell disease and coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) infection: a single-center experience.	PURPOSE: Sickle cell disease (SCD) has been found to be associated with an increased risk of hospitalization and death from coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). We sought to study clinical outcomes in patients with SCD and a diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of adult patients (>18 years) with SCD who were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection between 1 March 2020 and 31 March 2021. Data on baseline characteristics and overall outcomes were collected and analyzed using SAS 9.4 for Windows. RESULTS: A total of 51 patients with SCD were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection in the study period, out of which 39.3% were diagnosed and managed in the outpatient setting/emergency room (ER) and 60.3% in the inpatient setting. Disease-modifying therapy such as hydroxyurea did not impact inpatient vs outpatient/ER management (P > 0.05). Only 5.71% (n = 2) required intensive care unit admission and were mechanically ventilated and 3.9% (2 patients) died of complications of COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSION: We identified a lower mortality (3.9%) rate among patients in our cohort in comparison to previous studies and a higher burden of inpatient hospitalizations as compared to outpatient/ER management. Further prospective data are needed to validate these findings. Key messages What is already known on this topic COVID-19 has been shown to have a disproportionately unfavorable impact on African Americans, including longer hospital stays, higher rates of ventilator dependence, and a higher overall mortality rate. Limited data also suggest that sickle cell disease (SCD) is associated with an increased risk of hospitalization and death from COVID-19. What this study adds Our analysis did not show a higher mortality due to COVID-19 in patients with SCD. However, we identified a high burden of inpatient hospitalizations in this population. COVID-19-related outcomes did not improve with the use of disease-modifying therapies. How this study might affect research, practice, or policy These results will aid in decision making for triage of patients with COVID-19 and SCD and ensure the most appropriate use of healthcare resources. Our analysis underscores the need for more robust data to identify patients at higher risk of severe disease and/or mortality, necessitating inpatient hospitalization and aggressive management.
36350716	Creating an Automated Contemporaneous Cohort in Sickle Cell Anemia to Predict Survival After Disease-Modifying Therapy.	For participants receiving experimental gene therapy or gene editing clinical trials, the FDA requires contemporaneous controls to compare clinical outcomes. However, developing a contemporaneous cohort of rare diseases is costly and requires multiple person-hours. In a single referral center for sickle cell disease, we tested the hypothesis that we could create an automated contemporaneous cohort of children and adults with sickle cell anemia (SCA) to predict mortality. Data were obtained between 1/1/2004 and 4/30/2021. We identified 419 individuals with SCA with consistent medical care (i.e., followed continuously for >0.5 years with no visit gaps >=3.0 years). The median age was 10.2 years (IQR 1.0 - 24.0 years), with a median follow-up of 7.4 years (IQR 3.6-13.5 years) and 47 deaths. A total of 98% (274 of 277) of the children remained alive at 18 years of age, and 34.3% (94 of 274) of those children were followed into adulthood. For adults, the median age of survival was 49.3 years of age. Treatment groups were mutually exclusive and in a hierarchical order: hematopoietic stem cell transplant (n=22)>regular blood transfusion for at least two years (n=56)>hydroxyurea for at least one year (n=243)>no disease-modifying therapy (n=98). Compared to those receiving no disease-modifying treatment, those treated with hydroxyurea therapy had significantly lower hazard of mortality (hazard ratio=0.38, p=0.016), but no statistical difference for those receiving regular blood transfusions compared to no disease-modifying therapy (hazard ratio=0.71, p=0.440). An automated contemporaneous SCA cohort can be generated to estimate mortality in children and adults with SCA.
32808012	Fetal hemoglobin in sickle cell anemia.	Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) can blunt the pathophysiology, temper the clinical course, and offer prospects for curative therapy of sickle cell disease. This review focuses on (1) HbF quantitative trait loci and the geography of beta-globin gene haplotypes, especially those found in the Middle East; (2) how HbF might differentially impact the pathophysiology and many subphenotypes of sickle cell disease; (3) clinical implications of person-to-person variation in the distribution of HbF among HbF-containing erythrocytes; and (4) reactivation of HbF gene expression using both pharmacologic and cell-based therapeutic approaches. A confluence of detailed understanding of the molecular basis of HbF gene expression, coupled with the ability to precisely target by genomic editing most areas of the genome, is producing important preliminary therapeutic results that could provide new options for cell-based therapeutics with curative intent.
33890160	Effect of transfusion therapy on intracranial stenosis in a child with sickle cell anaemia.	
36541848	Delayed haemolytic transfusion reaction in paediatric patients with sickle cell disease: A retrospective study in a French national reference centre.	Delayed haemolytic transfusion reaction (DHTR) is a life-threatening haemolytic anaemia following red blood cell transfusion in patients with sickle cell disease, with only scarce data in children. We retrospectively analysed 41 cases of DHTR in children treated between 2006 and 2020 in a French university hospital. DHTR manifested at a median age of 10.5 years, symptoms occurred a median of 8 days after transfusion performed for an acute event (63%), before surgery (20%) or in a chronic transfusion programme (17%). In all, 93% of patients had painful crisis. Profound anaemia (median 49 g/L), low reticulocyte count (median 140 x109 /L) and increased lactate dehydrogenase (median 2239 IU/L) were observed. Antibody screening was positive in 51% of patients, and more frequent when there was a history of alloimmunisation. Although no deaths were reported, significant complications occurred in 51% of patients: acute chest syndrome (12 patients), cholestasis (five patients), stroke (two patients) and kidney failure (two patients). A further transfusion was required in 23 patients and corticosteroids were used in 21 to reduce the risk of additional haemolysis. In all, 13 patients subsequently received further transfusions with recurrence of DHTR in only two. The study affords a better overview of DHTR and highlights the need to establish guidelines for its management in children.
32920319	Cytokine changes in sickle-cell disease patients as markers predictive of the onset of delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions.	BACKGROUND: Changes in cytokine production are known to contribute to the pathogenesis of sickle-cell disease (SCD), particularly in painful acute complications (crises) and episodes of post-transfusion hemolysis. Little is known about cytokine profiles in patients with these complications. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We investigated possible associations between cytokine profile and the onset of delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions (DHTRs), particularly during acute-phase episodes, to improve characterization of the biological parameters predictive of such events. We included SCD patients with severe acute symptoms (n = 36) or steady-state disease (n = 31), both possibly leading to a DHTR (n = 18) event. Luminex  technology was used to determine the plasma concentrations of 23 cytokines. RESULTS: Regardless of clinical context, the concentrations of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, inducible protein-10, and macrophage inflammatory protein-1beta were higher in plasma samples from SCD patients than in those from healthy controls. IL-6 and IL-10 concentrations were even higher in acute-phase plasma samples from SCD patients. In addition, IL-27 and TNFalpha levels were higher, and IL-6 and RANTES levels were lower in acute-phase SCD patients just before the onset of DHTR than in patients experiencing painful occlusive episodes. CONCLUSION: In addition to reporting the plasma cytokine profiles of SCD patients in various clinical phases of the disease, we provide the first evidence of a significant association between low plasma TNFalpha concentration, high plasma IP-10 concentration and the onset of DHTR in SCD patients.
32735379	Vaso-occlusive crisis in a sickle cell patient after transfusion-transmitted dengue infection.	CASE REPORT: A 26-year-old woman with sickle cell disease (SCD) on chronic transfusion therapy complained of severe arthralgia, myalgia, abdominal pain, headache, and fever 24 hours after transfusion of a red blood cells (RBCs). Dengue virus (DENV) infection was suspected and the patient was hospitalized for clinical support and RBC transfusion, to lower the hemoglobin S to less than 30%. The patient's clinical condition improved approximately 8 days after the onset of symptoms. RESULTS: DENV type 2 (DENV-2) TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction was negative in the patient's pretransfusion sample while the posttransfusion sample was positive (Ct, 27.8), suggesting a high viral load and an acute infection. To investigate DENV transfusion transmission (TT-DENV) the stored donor serum was tested and was also positive (Ct, 25.8). Molecular typing confirmed the presence of DENV-2. The phylogenetic analysis of the DENV-2 strains obtained from both donor and patient samples were classified as the Southeast Asia-American genotype (Genotype III) and demonstrated 100% genomic identity, indicating TT-DENV. CONCLUSION: This is the first description of TT-DENV in a SCD patient. A presumed high viral load in the transfused RBC unit probably determined the early clinical manifestation. In endemic regions dengue fever should be considered as differential diagnosis in SCD patients with fever and acute pain crisis, mainly during DENV outbreaks.
32928457	Outcomes of an Emergency Department Observation Unit-Based Pathway for the Treatment of Uncomplicated Vaso-occlusive Events in Sickle Cell Disease.	STUDY OBJECTIVE: This was a prospective, pre-post, 13-year observational study documenting the multiyear implementation of an observation unit sickle cell pathway for patients with uncomplicated vaso-occlusive events. METHODS: The sickle cell pathway begins with rapid triage to identify patients with uncomplicated vaso-occlusive events for immediate transfer to the observation unit and initiation of patient-controlled analgesia followed by repeated evaluations of pain and identification of other complications. Data were abstracted from the electronic medical record or observation unit database. The sickle cell pathway was initiated in April 2006. Major revisions of it were carried out in June 2009 (physician evaluation occurs in sickle cell pathway and only patient-controlled analgesia administration of medications) and October 2010 (multidisciplinary management and individual dosing). RESULTS: Annual ED visits ranged between 287 and 528. The preimplementation hospital admission rate was 33% (123/368), 3-day return rate 16% (60/368), and 30-day return rate 67% (248/368). Refinements to the sickle cell pathway have resulted in a decrease in admission rate to 20% (258/1276); 3-day return rate, to 3.6% (46/1,276); and 30-day return rate, to 41% (525/1,276) for the past 3 years. CONCLUSION: The use of a sickle cell pathway for the treatment of uncomplicated vaso-occlusive events has been effective in providing rapid treatment and reducing hospital admissions. However, it was not only the intervention and its refinement that made the sickle cell pathway successful. With the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, it was discerned that outer setting factors of organizational commitment to the care of patients with SCD, inner setting factors of learning climate and leadership engagement, individuals, and process contributed to the success of the sickle cell pathway.
32765834	Drug Therapies for the Management of Sickle Cell Disease.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) afflicts millions of people worldwide but is referred to as an orphan disease in the United States. Over the past several decades, there has been an increasing understanding of the pathophysiology of SCD and its complications. While most individuals with SCD in resource-rich countries survive into adulthood, the life expectancy of patients with SCD remains substantially shorter than for the general African-American population. SCD can be cured using hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and possibly gene therapy, but these treatment approaches are not available to most patients, the majority of whom reside in low- and middle-income countries. Until relatively recently, only one drug, hydroxyurea, was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to ameliorate disease severity. Multiple other drugs (L-glutamine, crizanlizumab, and voxelotor) have recently been approved for the treatment of SCD, with several others at various stages of clinical testing. The availability of multiple agents to treat SCD raises questions related to the choice of appropriate drug therapy, combination of multiple agents, and affordability of recently approved products. The enthusiasm for new drug development provides opportunities to involve patients in low- and middle-income nations in the testing of potentially disease-modifying therapies and has the potential to contribute to capacity building in these environments. Demonstration that these agents, alone or in combination, can prevent or decrease end-organ damage would provide additional evidence for the role of drug therapies in improving outcomes in SCD.
33059298	Trends in hospitalizations and epidemiological characteristics of adults Moyamoya disorder in the United States.	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There has been an increasing prevalence of Moyamoya disorder (MMD) reported from recent US literature. There is a paucity of data available regarding trends of prevalence and epidemiological factors in the United States. To goal of this study was to test the hypotheses that racial-, sex-specific MMD hospitalizations and epidemiological factors have been increasing in the United States over the last decade. METHODS: In this retrospective observational study, using the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database from 2005 to 2016, MMD-related hospitalizations in patients aged >=18 years were identified. Trends of epidemiological factors were analyzed over time using the linear regression model with the significance of differences in trend over time assessed using the Wald test. Sex- and race-specific burden of MMD were calculated using the annual US Census data. Joinpoint regression model was used to evaluate trends of hospitalizations over time. RESULTS: A total of 24,484 adult hospitalizations were identified from January 2005 to September 2015 after excluding <18 years. Among them, approximately ~90% were aged <=60 years, and 73.5% were females. The most common vascular and non-vascular presentations were ischemic stroke (17.3%) and seizures (21%), respectively. The trend of antithrombotic therapy has increased, while extracranial-intracranial bypass has remained stagnant. The actual average hospitalizations of MMD was 10.4 cases/ million population/year (range 4.1-17.9) and varied significantly by sex (females 14.7 [range 6.2-23.6] and males 5.9 [range 1.8-11.9]) over the 2005 to 2016 study period. The burden of hospitalizations also differed by race (African Americans 40.6 [range 32.8-63.7], Asians 24.8 [15.4-34.8], Non-Hispanic Whites 8.1 [range 6.4-11.5], and Hispanics 8.4 [2.8-12.8]) over the 2010 to 2016 study period. Joinpoint regression analysis showed an increasing overall MMD trend across the study period (+11.7%; P < 0.001), which was higher in males (+14.5% vs. +10.7%; P < 0.001). The Hispanic group had significantly increased hospitalizations over the years (+20.2%; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Although overall more prevalent in females, MMD-related hospitalizations are increasing more rapidly in males. Among the racial subpopulations, African Americans had the highest MMD-related hospitalizations, even higher than Asian Americans. MMD-related hospitalizations have increased quicker in Hispanics than in any other racial group.
32994194	Remodelling of specialist services enables safe reduction in hospital admissions of patients with sickle cell disease: Lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic.	Sickle cell disease is characterised by recurrent painful crises often leading to hospitalisation. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it was important to try to reduce the need for hospital admission for these high-risk patients while at the same time ensuring that hospital avoidance did not put them at risk of deterioration from disease-related complications. In the 3-month period between March and May 2020, there was a significant reduction in the number of hospital admissions as well as mean length of stay compared with the mean figures over the same months in the preceding 5 years (2015-19), with an overall reduction in inpatient days of 77%. There were no cases of unsafe hospital avoidance or presentations to hospital that were inappropriately delayed. Frequent telephone communication with patients and provision of ambulatory care were, among others, two very important means of supporting our patient population.
36579749	Trends in blood transfusion, hydroxyurea use, and iron overload among children with sickle cell disease enrolled in Medicaid, 2004-2019.	BACKGROUND: There have been significant changes in clinical guidelines for sickle cell disease (SCD) over the past two decades, including updated indications for hydroxyurea, transfusions, and iron overload management. In practice however, there are few studies that examine SCD care utilization over time. METHODS: We conducted a serial cross-sectional cohort study of pediatric SCD patients from 2004 to 2019 using Georgia Medicaid claims data. For each year, we reported receipt of any transfusion, chronic transfusion, or three or more filled hydroxyurea prescriptions. For children receiving chronic transfusion (six or more annual transfusions), we evaluated iron overload diagnosis, monitoring, and chelation use. Among children with sickle cell anemia (SCA), we examined rates of transfusions and hydroxyurea use. The Cochran-Armitage test was used to assess trend. RESULTS: There were 5316 unique children 2-18 years old with SCD enrolled in Georgia Medicaid from 2004 to 2019. Children receiving any transfusion increased from 2004 to 2010, then stabilized. In SCA patients, chronic transfusions initially increased from 2004 to 2010, then stabilized from 2010 to 2019. For chronically transfused children, monitoring of iron burden and filled chelator prescriptions both increased significantly. Hydroxyurea use in SCA patients increased from 12% to 37%, with increases noted within each age group, most notably from 21% to 60% in the 13-18-year-old cohort. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated changes in SCD care utilization over time, including increased hydroxyurea use, changes in transfusion rates, and increased attention to iron overload management. While trends in clinical management do follow updates in treatment guidelines, there is still delayed and suboptimal uptake of guideline recommendations in pediatric SCD patients.
37046407	Feasibility study of busulfan, fludarabine, and thiotepa conditioning regimen for allogeneic hematopoietic stemcell transplantationfor children and young adults with nonmalignant disorders.	BACKGROUND: Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is the only curative treatment for several pediatric non-malignant disorders. A widely used conditioning backbone is busulfan, fludarabine, and rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (rATG). Thiotepa has improved engraftment when added to this regimen, however the minimum effective dose (MED) of thiotepa to achieve engraftment while minimizing toxicities has not been well established. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this prospective feasibility study was to determine the MED of thiotepa (5mg/kg) in combination with reduced-dose busulfan, fludarabine or cyclophosphamide, and rATG required to achieve engraftment in >90% of HSCT recipients for non-malignant disorders with acceptable toxicity. RESULTS: Six patients who received fully matched HSCT were enrolled. Patient diagnoses included Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (n = 1), CD40L deficiency (n = 1), sickle cell disease (n = 2), autoinflammatory syndrome (n = 1), and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (n = 1). All six patients achieved engraftment prior to Day +42 and five patients had stable full donor engraftment. Two of the six patients (33%) developed acute GVHD and/or chronic GHVD, both of whom had sickle cell disease. At a median follow-up of 2.25 years post-transplant, all patients were alive without evidence of disease recurrence. None of the patients experienced grade 4 or 5 toxicities. Three out of six patients (50%) developed grade 3 adverse events. Neurocognitive functioning of children under 10 years of age was not adversely affected by this regimen. CONCLUSION: This approach shows acceptable toxicity and reliable engraftment in children with non-malignant disorders receiving related or unrelated HLA-matched transplants.
33601015	Integrative holistic approaches for children, adolescents, and young adults with sickle cell disease: A single center experience.	CONTEXT: Painful vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs) associated with sickle cell disease (SCD) are the most common cause of morbidity, hospitalizations, and poor quality of life. Additional symptoms such as sleep disturbances, fatigue, and stress are also common. Non-traditional approaches are often used by families, but concerns remain that patients may forgo standard of care effective therapies in favor of dangerous unproven alternatives. OBJECTIVES: To describe a single center experience related to a multidisciplinary integrative medicine clinic within the division of hematology dedicated to children and young adults with SCD. METHODS: The Sickle Cell Integrative Clinic at Children's National Hospital services patients with SCD. The main goal of this clinic is to provide access to non-pharmacologic interventions, and to manage patients' symptoms in a holistic manner along with standard of care management of SCD. This IRB approved study evaluated experiences of both patients and parents who attended this clinic. RESULTS: Thirty-seven unique patients attended this clinic over 2 years and 31 participated in the study. After attending the SCD integrative clinic, the majority of patients reported integrative therapies to be an acceptable way of treating pain and believed these to be effective. Overall, the vast majority (88 %) of patients reported having a positive experience with the therapies offered in the clinic. None of the patients experienced any adverse events related to integrative therapies provided in the clinic. CONCLUSION: Our experience suggests that encouraging conversations and offering safe and potentially effective integrative therapies alongside conventional SCD therapies under medical guidance allows patients to have an open discussion about their beliefs and treatment goals, improves patient satisfaction and can improve outcomes.
37399450	Early Diagnosis of Sickle Cell Disease at Birth Hospitals and Vaccination Centers in Angola Using Point-of-Care Tests.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a life-threatening blood disorder affecting >300,000 infants annually, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa. Most infants do not have access to an early diagnosis and die early from treatable complications of SCD. Universal NBS is not yet available in any African country for a variety of reasons, including lack of laboratory capacity, difficulty in tracking affected infants, and the relatively short stay of mothers and newborns at maternity hospitals. Several point-of-care (POC) tests for SCD have been recently developed and validated, but the two most well-established tests (Sickle SCAN and HemoTypeSC) have not been rigorously compared to one another. In this study, we aimed to evaluate and compare these two POC tests to screen infants <=6 months of age in Luanda, Angola. Challenging the traditional NBS paradigm, we performed testing not only at maternity centers, but also at vaccination centers across Luanda. We enrolled 2,000 babies and performed 1,000 tests with each POC test. Both tests demonstrated diagnostic accuracy, with 98.3% of Sickle SCAN results and 95.3% of HemoTypeSC results aligning with the gold standard isoelectric focusing hemoglobin pattern. When the result was provided at the POC, 92% of infants were linked to SCD care compared to 56% in the pilot Angolan NBS program, which used centralized laboratory testing. This study demonstrates the real-world feasibility and accuracy of POC tests to screen infants for SCD in Angola. This study also suggests that including vaccination centers may improve the capture rate for early infant SCD screening programs.
33103306	The haemoglobinopathy survey: The reality of transfusion practice in sickle cell disease and thalassaemia in England.	OBJECTIVES: To establish, in an unselected population of London haemoglobinopathy patients, transfusion requirements, blood antigens/alloantibodies, transfusion modalities, burden of transfusion reactions and donor exposure. BACKGROUND: Haemoglobinopathy patients are among the most highly transfused patient populations, and the overall population and number of patients on long-term transfusion programmes are increasing. To provide a safe and efficacious transfusion service for patients, it is important to understand current practice, morbidity associated with transfusion, efficacy of different transfusion modalities and geno-/phenotype requirements. METHODS: Data on 4451 transfusion episodes in 760 patients from 12 London hospitals were collected retrospectively over a 6-month period in 2011. RESULTS: Alloimmunisation prevalence was 17% for sickle cell disease (SCD) and 22% for thalassaemia, most commonly anti-Rh/Kell/Kpa /Cw . Rh phenotypes differed between SCD (Ro r 59.8%/R1 r 15.9%/R2 r 15.6%) and thalassaemia (R1 R1 29.6%/R1 r 28.4%/R1 R2 15.4%). Recording of pheno-/genotypes fell below recommendations. A 2-weekly manual exchange and 3-weekly automated exchange came closest to achieving presumptive targets. In adults with thalassaemia, the mean blood requirement was 36 units per year; for SCD, erythrocytapheresis was carried out every 7 weeks with 66 units; for manual exchange, it was 38 units every 4 weeks; and for simple transfusion, it was 30 units p.a. every 4 weeks. CONCLUSION: Transfusion modality choice was influenced by the resources available-children mostly received simple transfusions, and adults received erythrocytapheresis; the relationships between frequency of exchanges/transfusion modality/target HbA% were not simple, possibly reflecting the difference in recipient erythropoiesis and consequent transfusion modality selection bias; adherence to existing and current guidelines regarding geno-/phenotyping was limited; and alloimmunisation had a low incidence and high prevalence in both disorders.

32813873	Abatacept is effective as GVHD prophylaxis in unrelated donor stem cell transplantation for children with severe sickle cell disease.	We report results of a phase 1 multicenter stem cell transplantation (SCT) trial from HLA-matched (n = 7) or one-antigen-mismatched (n = 7) unrelated donors (URD) using bone marrow or cord blood as stem cell source, following reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) in severe sickle cell disease (SCD). Conditioning included distal alemtuzumab, fludarabine, and melphalan (matched donors), with thiotepa (mismatched donors). Abatacept, a selective inhibitor of T cell costimulation, was added to tacrolimus and methotrexate as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis to offset GVHD risks, and was administered for longer duration in bone marrow recipients than in cord blood recipients because of increased incidence of chronic GVHD with bone marrow. Median age at transplant was 13 years (range, 7-21 years). The incidence of grades II to IV and grades III to IV acute GVHD at day +100 was 28.6% and 7%, respectively. One-year incidence of chronic GVHD was 57% and mild/limited in all but 1 patient who received abatacept for a longer duration. Only 1 patient developed reversible posterior encephalopathy syndrome and recovered. With a median follow-up of 1.6 years (range, 1-5.5 years), the 2-year overall and disease-free survival was 100% and 92.9%, respectively. The encouraging results from the phase 1 portion of this RIC SCT trial, despite risk factors such as older age, URD, and HLA-mismatch, support further evaluation of URD SCT in clinical trial settings. The phase 2 portion of the trial is in progress. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03128996.

34773444	Measuring transition readiness in adolescents and young adults with sickle cell disease using the transition readiness assessment questionnaire.	BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Adolescents and young adults (AYA) with sickle cell disease (SCD) face challenges related to the disease and its treatment. The Transition Readiness Assessment Questionnaire (TRAQ) is a self-report tool for assessing transition readiness for youth with special health care needs (YSHCN), including SCD. This study uses the TRAQ to understand transition readiness in patients with SCD treated at the Boston Medical Center and evaluates associations between TRAQ scores and transition outcomes (e.g., emergency department reliance [EDr] and emergency department utilization [EDu]). METHODS: We reviewed electronic medical records of AYA with SCD who completed the TRAQ in the pediatric hematology clinic between January 1, 2019, and March 1, 2020, and categorized healthcare encounters to calculate EDu and EDr.  We used t tests and ANOVA models to analyze mean TRAQ scores, sex, age, genotype, EDu, and EDr. RESULTS: The sample was 45 AYA patients with SCD between 13 and 22 years old. The mean TRAQ score for the overall patient sample was 3.67. Mean TRAQ scores did not significantly vary by sex or genotype but did significantly increase with age. TRAQ scores did not correlate to EDu or EDr. CONCLUSIONS: AYA patients with SCD have low transition readiness. The age of 18 may not be the most reliable attribute of readiness, though older patients do have higher readiness. The relationship between TRAQ scores, EDr, and EDu is not clear and requires further evaluation.

31790841	Outcomes in Patients with Moyamoya Syndrome and Sickle Cell Disease: A Systematic Review.	BACKGROUND: Moyamoya syndrome, a progressive, idiopathic stenosis of the internal carotid arteries, results in increased risk for both ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. Revascularization procedures have been shown in small studies to be both safe and efficacious for these patients; however, randomized controlled trials are lacking. The goal of this systematic review is to organize the literature evaluating surgical intervention versus conservative medical management. METHODS: A systematic review was performed including studies with 3 or more participants with moyamoya syndrome in the setting of sickle cell disease and a measured outcome after either medical or surgical intervention. Relevant studies were identified using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses criteria and a set of predetermined key words. RESULTS: Sixty-one articles were identified with 6 articles ultimately included in this review (N = 122). Of the patients, 73 (59.8%) were revascularized surgically (all indirect procedures), whereas 49 (40.2%) remained on chronic transfusion therapy. Of the patients that underwent indirect revascularization surgery, a total of 1 perioperative (1.4%) and 4 postoperative strokes (5.5%) were reported over 44 months (1 stroke per 53.3 patient-years). In comparison, an average of 46.5% of patients who were receiving chronic transfusions had major events (stroke or transient ischemic attack) while undergoing therapy (1 stroke per 13.65 patient-years, P = 0.00215). CONCLUSIONS: We present a large systematic review of the literature regarding outcomes of surgical and medical management for patients with moyamoya syndrome and sickle cell disease. The findings redemonstrate the efficacy and safety of surgical revascularization, and advocate for earlier discussion around surgical intervention.
33368343	Safety and benefits of automated red cell depletion-exchange compared to standard exchange in patients with sickle cell disease undergoing chronic transfusion.	BACKGROUND: The Spectra Optia allows automated performance of red blood cell reduction and isovolemic hemodilution (IHD) prior to standard red cell exchange (RCE), and is primarily intended for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) undergoing chronic RCE. Data on the safety of inducing transient further anemia and the benefits of IHD-RCE is limited and occasionally contradictory. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In this retrospective crossover analysis of six patients with SCD who underwent chronic exchange with standard RCE (Cobe Spectra) followed by IHD-RCE (Spectra Optia), we compared safety and benefit outcomes with IHD-RCE vs standard RCE. RESULTS: There were statistically but not clinically significant drops in blood pressure in the post-IHD phase. With IHD-RCE, there were significant reductions in red blood cell (RBC) usage and/or lower fraction of cells and significant increases in postprocedure hematocrit (Hct) associated with increased preprocedure Hct. There were no differences achieved in the time interval between procedures or in the net RBC gain with IHD-RCE. Overall, there were also no significant differences in pre- and postprocedure percentage of hemoglobin S, reticulocyte count, interval daily hemoglobin A decrement, or postprocedure white blood cell, neutrophil, or platelet counts. CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports that IHD-RCE can be safely used in patients with stroke risk and compared to standard RCE, results in benefits of lower RBC usage and/or fraction of cells remaining and higher postprocedure Hct associated with higher preprocedure Hct. These findings support wider use of IHD-RCE, especially in the current environment with reduced availability of minority units.
37184905	Developing an Implementation Blueprint for the NIH HEAL Initiative GRACE Trial: Perspectives on Acupuncture and Guided Relaxation for Chronic Sickle Cell Disease Pain.	Objective: This study aimed to explore perspectives of people living with sickle cell disease (SCD) and SCD clinic providers and staff about the use of acupuncture and guided relaxation for treating chronic SCD pain. Data obtained were to inform an implementation blueprint for an effectiveness implementation clinical trial (GRACE Trial) testing whether acupuncture or guided relaxation reduces chronic pain when compared with usual care. Design: Qualitative research design. Methods: We conducted 33 semistructured interviews with people with SCD and SCD clinic providers and staff. Interviews were transcribed and coded. A deductive content analysis process was used to identify themes. Results: Four themes were identified: Receptivity to Acupuncture and Guided Relaxation, Limited Awareness, Complementary and Integrative Health (CIH) Therapy Preference, and Access Barriers. Both patients and clinic providers and staff were open to the use of acupuncture and guided relaxation for chronic pain treatment. After learning about these CIH therapies, some patients expressed a preference for one therapy over the other. They also discussed their ability to successfully engage with each therapy. There is a need to dispel misconceptions about the therapies by increasing understanding of how each therapy is implemented and functions to reduce pain. We identified several potential barriers that might affect the success of the trial and future health system integration, including time, transportation, and technology. Conclusion: This study is one of the first to present perspectives of both patients with SCD and clinic providers and staff on the use of acupuncture and guided relaxation for chronic SCD pain. Stakeholders' early input and perspectives highlighted that they welcome nonpharmacological CIH therapies. Implementation of a clinical trial and future health system integration will require the addressing misinformation and identifying strategies to overcome access barriers. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04906447.
38066873	Alloimmunization and hyperhemolysis in sickle cell disease.	Alloimmunization against red blood cell antigens and delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction (DHTR) are major barriers to transfusion in sickle cell disease (SCD). In SCD, DHTR is a potentially life-threatening. Blood group polymorphism in SCD patients, who are of African ancestry and frequently exposed to antigens they do not carry; an inflammatory clinical state; and occasional transfusion in acute situations are risk factors for alloimmunization and DHTR. In patients at risk, the transfusion indication must be balanced against the risk of developing DHTR. However, when transfusion is absolutely necessary, protocols combining the prevention of exposure to immunogenic antigens with immunosuppressive treatments must be implemented, and patients should be carefully monitored during posttransfusion follow-up. This close monitoring makes it possible to diagnose hyperhemolysis as soon as possible; to avoid retransfusion, which can exacerbate hemolysis; and to administer specific treatments, such as anticomplement therapy, in severe cases. Finally, in patients with severe disease, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation may be indicated. However, transfusion is also required in this context, and its management is complex because these risks must be taken into account.
35260809	A population-based analysis of predictors of penile surgical intervention among inpatients with acute priapism.	While consensus exists regarding risk factors for priapism, predictors of operative intervention are less well established. We assessed patient and hospital-level predictors associated with penile surgical intervention (PSI) for patients admitted with acute priapism, as well as length of stay (LOS) and total hospital charges using the National Inpatient Sample (2010-2015). Inpatients with acute priapism were stratified by PSI, defined as penile shunts, incisions, and placement of penile prostheses, exclusive of irrigation procedures. Survey-weighted logistic regression models were utilized to assess predictors of PSI. Negative binomial regression and generalized linear models with logarithmic transformation were used to compare PSI to LOS and total hospital charges, respectively. Among 14,529 weighted hospitalizations, 4,953 underwent PSI. Non-Medicare insurances, substance abuse, and >=3 Elixhauser comorbidities had increased odds of PSI. Conversely, Black patients, sickle cell disease, alcohol abuse, neurologic diseases, malignancies, and teaching hospitals had lower odds. PSI coincided with shorter median LOS (adjusted IRR: 0.62; p < 0.001) and lower ratio of the mean hospital charges (adjusted Ratio: 0.49; p < 0.001). Additional subgroup analysis revealed penile incisions and shunts primarily associated with reduced LOS (adjusted IRR: 0.66; p < 0.001) and total hospital charges (adjusted Ratio: 0.49; p < 0.001). Further work is required to understand predictors of poor outcomes in these populations.
32191546	Mechanisms underlying priapism in sickle cell disease: targeting and key innovations on the preclinical landscape.	Introduction: Priapism is prolonged penile erection in the absence of sexual arousal or desire and is a devastating condition affecting millions of patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) globally. Available drug treatments for SCD-related priapism remain limited and have been primarily reactive rather than preventive. Hence, there is an unmet need for new drug targets and pharmacologic therapies.Areas covered: We examine the molecular mechanisms underlying SCD-associated priapism evaluated mostly in animal models. In mouse models of SCD, molecular defects of priapism operating at the cavernous tissue level include reduced tonic NO/cGMP signaling, elevated oxidative/nitrosative stress, vascular adhesion molecule derangements, excessive adenosine and opiorphin signaling, dysregulated vasoconstrictive RhoA/ROCK signaling, and testosterone deficiency. We discuss the consequences of downregulated cGMP-dependent phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) activity in response to these molecular signaling derangements, as the main effector mechanism causing unrestrained cavernous tissue relaxation that results in priapism.Expert opinion: Basic science studies are crucial for understanding the underlying pathophysiology of SCD-associated priapism. Understanding the molecular mechanisms could unearth new therapeutic targets for this condition based on these mechanisms. Treatment options should aim to improve deranged erection physiology regulatory signaling to prevent priapism and potentially restore or preserve erectile function.
36450880	Bone loss is ameliorated by fecal microbiota transplantation through SCFA/GPR41/ IGF1 pathway in sickle cell disease mice.	Bone loss is common in sickle cell disease (SCD), but the molecular mechanisms is unclear. Serum insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) was low in SCD subjects and SCD mice. To determine if decreased IGF1 associated with low bone mass in SCD is due to reduced SCFA production by gut microbiota, we performed reciprocal fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) between healthy control (Ctrl) and SCD mice. uCT and histomorphometry analysis of femur showed decreased bone volume/total volume (BV/TV), trabecular number (Tb.N), osteoblast surface/bone surface (Ob.S/BS), mineralizing surface/ bone surface (MS/BS), inter-label thickness (Ir.L.Th) in SCD mice were significantly improved after receiving Ctrl feces. Bone formation genes Alp, Col1, Runx2, and Dmp1 from SCD mice were significantly decreased and were rescued after FMT from Ctrl feces. Transplantation of Ctrl feces increased the butyrate, valerate, and propionate levels in cecal content of SCD mice. Decreased G-coupled protein receptors 41 and 43 (GPR41 and GPR43) mRNA in tibia and lower IGF1 in bone and serum of SCD mice were partially restored after FMT from Ctrl feces. These data indicate that the healthy gut microbiota of Ctrl mice is protective for SCD bone loss through regulating IGF1 in response to impaired bacterial metabolites SCFAs.
38190311	An Updated Equitable Model of Readiness for Transition to Adult Care: Content Validation in Young People With Sickle Cell Disease.	Importance: Despite elevated health risks during young adulthood, many adolescents and young adults with serious health care needs face barriers during the transfer to an adult specialty practitioner, and health disparities may occur during the transition. Objective: To validate the content of an updated Social-Ecological Model of Adolescent and Young Adult Readiness for Transition to Promote Health Equity (SMART-E) in a group of adolescents and young adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) and their supports. Design, Setting, and Participants: Health equity framework components were reviewed. Systems of power (eg, institutional and practitioner bias) and environments or networks (eg, peer or school support) were added as SMART-E preexisting factors, and health literacy was included within readiness factors. Adolescents and young adults aged 16 to 29 years with SCD, caregivers, and practitioners participated in this convergent, mixed-methods study within Children's Hospital of Philadelphia between January and August 2022. Main Outcomes and Measures: Content validity was assessed through nominations of top 3 most important transition barriers prior to interviews and focus groups, ratings on importance of SMART-E factors (0-4 scale; ratings >2 support validity) after interviews and focus groups, nominations of 3 most important factors for transition and for health equity, and qualitative content analysis of interview transcripts. Results: The study enrolled 10 pediatric adolescents and young adults (mean [SD] age, 18.6 [2.9] years; 4 female and 6 male), 10 transferred adolescents and young adults (mean [SD] age, 22.9 [2.1] years; 8 female and 2 male), 9 caregivers (mean [SD] age, 49.8 [8.7] years; 5 female and 4 male), and 9 practitioners (mean [SD] age, 45.6 [10.5] years; 8 female and 1 male). Quantitative ratings supported the content validity of SMART-E and met established criteria for validity. Systems of power was the most endorsed transition barrier (14 of 38 participants) reported prior to interviews and focus groups. After the interview, participants endorsed all SMART-E factors as important for transition, with new factors systems of power and environments and networks rated at a mean (SD) 2.8 (1.23) and 3.1 (0.90), respectively, on a 0 to 4 scale of importance. The most important factors for transition and equity varied by participant group, with all factors being endorsed, supporting the comprehensiveness of SMART-E. Qualitative data corroborated quantitative findings, further supporting validity, and minor modifications were made to definitions. Conclusions and Relevance: SMART-E obtained initial content validation with inclusion of health equity factors for adolescents and young adults with SCD, caregivers, and practitioners. The model should be evaluated in other populations of adolescents and young adults with chronic disease.
37190012	CRISPR-Cas System: The Current and Emerging Translational Landscape.	CRISPR-Cas technology has rapidly changed life science research and human medicine. The ability to add, remove, or edit human DNA sequences has transformative potential for treating congenital and acquired human diseases. The timely maturation of the cell and gene therapy ecosystem and its seamless integration with CRISPR-Cas technologies has enabled the development of therapies that could potentially cure not only monogenic diseases such as sickle cell anemia and muscular dystrophy, but also complex heterogenous diseases such as cancer and diabetes. Here, we review the current landscape of clinical trials involving the use of various CRISPR-Cas systems as therapeutics for human diseases, discuss challenges, and explore new CRISPR-Cas-based tools such as base editing, prime editing, CRISPR-based transcriptional regulation, CRISPR-based epigenome editing, and RNA editing, each promising new functionality and broadening therapeutic potential. Finally, we discuss how the CRISPR-Cas system is being used to understand the biology of human diseases through the generation of large animal disease models used for preclinical testing of emerging therapeutics.

32869281	Changing the Clinical Paradigm of Hydroxyurea Treatment for Sickle Cell Anemia Through Precision Medicine.	Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is a common and devastating inherited blood disorder, affecting millions of people across the world. Without treatment, SCA results in tremendous morbidity and early mortality. Hydroxyurea is the primary and most well-established pharmacologic therapy with proven benefits to ameliorate the clinical course of SCA, primarily due to its ability to increase the expression of fetal hemoglobin (HbF), which prevents sickling of red blood cells. The optimal induction of HbF depends upon selection and maintenance of the proper dose that maximizes benefits and minimizes toxicity. Due to the significant interpatient variability in hydroxyurea pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and dosing, most patients treated with hydroxyurea receive suboptimal doses and have only modest treatment responses. Recognizing this variability, using a precision medicine approach, we developed and prospectively evaluated an individualized dosing model for children with SCA, designed to optimize the hydroxyurea dose and clinical response. We utilize novel laboratory methods and a sparse sampling strategy requiring only 10 muL of blood collected 15 minutes, 60 minutes, and 180 minutes after a test dose. We use Bayesian adaptive control to estimate hydroxyurea exposure and to select an individual, optimal starting dose. This dosing model has resulted in HbF responses >30-40%, levels beyond what is achieved with traditional weight-based dosing and trial and error dose escalation. This hydroxyurea dosing strategy, if widely implemented, has the potential to change the treatment paradigm of hydroxyurea therapy and improve outcomes for the millions of patients with SCA across the world.

34350622	Patient-reported neurocognitive symptoms influence instrumental activities of daily living in sickle cell disease.	Individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD) experience neurocognitive decline, low medication adherence, increased unemployment, and difficulty with instrumental activities of daily living (IADL). The relationship between self-perceived cognitive difficulties and IADLs, including employment, school enrollment, independence, engagement in leisure activities, and medication adherence is unknown. We hypothesized that self-reported difficulties across neurocognitive areas would predict lower IADL skills. Adolescent and adult participants of the multi-site Sickle Cell Disease Implementation Consortium (SCDIC) (n = 2436) completed patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures of attention, executive functioning, processing speed, learning, and comprehension. Cognitive symptoms were analyzed as predictors in multivariable modeling. Outcome variables included 1) an IADL composite that consisted of employment, participation in school, reliance on others, and leisure pursuits, and 2) hydroxyurea adherence. Participants reported cognitive difficulty across areas of attention (55%), executive functioning (51%), processing speed (57%), and reading comprehension (65%). Executive dysfunction (p < 0.001) and sometimes or often experiencing learning difficulties (p < 0.001 and p = 0.04) and poor comprehension (p = 0.000 and p = 0.001), controlled for age (p < 0.001), pain (p < 0.001), and hydroxyurea use (p = 0.001), were associated with poor IADL skills. Executive functioning difficulties (p = 0.021), controlled for age (p = 0.013 for ages 25-34), genotype (p = 0.001), and hemoglobin (p = 0.004), predicted hydroxyurea non-adherence. Analysis of PRO measures indicated that cognitive dysfunction is prevalent in adolescents and adults with SCD. Cognitive dysfunction translated into clinically meaningful outcomes. PRO of cognitive symptoms can be used as an important adjunct clinical tool to monitor symptoms that impact functional skills, including engagement in societal activities and medication adherence.
37858508	The evolving treatment landscape for children with sickle cell disease.	Sickle cell disease is the most common inherited pathological haemoglobinopathy. Over the past 30 years, disease-related morbidity and mortality have improved in high-income countries due to advances in preventive care and treatments. Established disease-modifying therapies, such as hydroxyurea (hydrocarbamide), are continuing to have an important role in the treatment of sickle cell disease, and newer agents also show promise. In the past 5 years, the US Food and Drug Administration approved three additional sickle cell disease-modifying medications, and new gene therapies have been developed as an alternative curative treatment to haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. In this Review, we discuss the current treatment landscape for paediatric sickle cell disease and emerging innovations in care. We also review the need for close, long-term management for children receiving newer therapies and the importance of ongoing investment in people with sickle cell disease in low-income and middle-income countries.
34252204	Impact of universal irradiation on chronic transfusion for sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Irradiation of blood products prevents transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease, but most patients do not require this modification which could have an adverse impact on transfusion outcomes. We hypothesized that irradiation may increase transfusion requirements for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) receiving chronic transfusion. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Our pediatric hospital implemented a new policy of universal blood product irradiation in May 2018. We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients with SCD receiving chronic red blood cell (RBC) transfusion throughout the year before and after institution of this policy. The primary outcome was the change in RBC transfusion volume per patient weight transfused during the pre- vs. post- universal irradiation period. Secondary outcomes were the change in median pretransfusion laboratory values. RESULTS: Among 17 patients, 8 (47%) received more RBCs the year before irradiation and 9 (53%) received more the year after irradiation. Implementation of universal irradiation did not significantly increase transfusion volumes needed to clinically manage this population (median change +1.7 ml/kg/year, p = .54). Additionally, there were no significant changes in absolute reticulocyte count, hemoglobin, hemoglobin S%, white blood cell count, lactate dehydrogenase, total bilirubin, serum potassium, and ferritin during the two time periods. CONCLUSION: In a cohort of patients with SCD receiving simple chronic transfusion, irradiation did not impact transfusion requirements or pertinent pretransfusion laboratory values. Irradiation does not appear to have clinically significant consequences for SCD chronic transfusion management.
36519666	Reconsidering sickle cell trait testing of red blood cell units allocated to children with sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell trait (SCT) testing of red blood cell (RBC) units is sometimes performed to identify and divert units containing hemoglobin S (HbS). Recipients strategically guarded against this exposure include fetuses, neonates, and children with sickle cell disease (SCD). The clinical necessity of this practice is unclear. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A one-year audit (2018) was performed at a pediatric tertiary care hospital that tests for SCT in RBC units prescribed to children with SCD and neonates. The impact of incorporating varying numbers of SCT RBC units in a single-unit top-up, partial-manual red cell exchange, and automated erythrocytapheresis was modeled in four typical-parameter age scenarios (2, 5, 10, and 18 years) sharing a high baseline HbS. Additionally, a survey assessing SCT testing practices was administered to Canadian pediatric hospital transfusion laboratories serving hemoglobinopathy programs. RESULTS: Of 2268 donor RBC units tested, one was positive for SCT (0.04% [95% CI: 0.01%-0.24%]), at a cost of $19,384.56 CAD. The impact of SCT unit incorporation on lost HbS reduction was modest (Delta1%-3% [automated erythrocytapheresis] and Delta4%-15% [top-up/partial manual exchange]). The survey (with all 13 sites responding) showed variable SCT testing practice; four (31%) do not test, four (31%) test for children with SCD, and six (46%) test for neonates. CONCLUSION: RBC SCT testing may be more costly than beneficial or necessary in children with SCD. As of 2019, our transfusion service has ceased SCT testing for this population. Further research in the fetal/neonatal populations is needed to overturn this entrenched practice.
31697818	How I treat sickle cell disease with hematopoietic cell transplantation.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) leads to significant morbidity and early mortality, and hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is the only widely available cure, with impacts seen on SCD-related organ dysfunction. Outcomes are excellent following matched-related donor (MRD) HCT, leading to significantly expanded application of this treatment over the past decade. The majority of SCD patients lack an MRD, but outcomes following alternative donor HCT continue to improve on clinical trials. Within this framework, we aim to provide our perspective on how to apply research findings to clinical practice, for an individual patient. We also emphasize that the preparation of SCD recipients for HCT and supporting them through HCT have special nuances that require awareness and close attention. Through the use of clinical vignettes, we provide our perpsective on the complex decision-making process in HCT for SCD as well as recommendations for the evaluation and support of these patients through HCT.
32949739	Management of Acute Pulmonary Embolism in a Patient with Sickle Cell Anemia Using Catheter-Directed Thrombolysis.	The efficacy of thrombolytic therapy in submassive pulmonary embolism (PE) management is lacking, particularly in specific patient subgroups. The current case report demonstrates the use of catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) therapy in conjunction with standard systemic anticoagulation in a patient with sickle cell disease presenting with a submassive PE and chronic thrombus burden. CDT may potentially play a role in the management of submassive PE in sickle cell patients.
31663619	Transitions to adulthood: self-governance and disciplining in the making of patient citizens.	Young people develop new behaviours and redefine their identities during health transitions when they move from paediatric to adult healthcare environments. Their identities help to guide their health-related actions in response to life changes. Young people's health is increasingly recognised as important, yet we lack understanding of how health transitions shape identities and how they relate to other transitions to adulthood. We conducted a longitudinal interview study with young people with sickle cell disease to explore how young people define new identities as they transition to adulthood. We show how 'disciplining at a distance' via healthcare self-management discourses and neoliberal norms governing adolescence play out in the tensions participants encounter when they are crafting new identities. Health transitions involve struggles to negotiate competing demands for self-discipline. It is crucial to create enabling spaces for young people to protect their health while still developing identities that help them achieve life goals.

35700397	Transitioning Adolescents With Sickle Cell Disease From Pediatric to Adult Care: Results From a New Survey of Health Care Professionals.	Transition from pediatric to adult care for adolescents and young adults (AYA) with sickle cell disease (SCD) comes at a time when a range of biopsychosocial issues occur simultaneously. A new survey sought information from physicians who treat AYA with SCD about their practices in how they transition pediatric patients to adult care. An online survey to physicians who treat SCD was conducted using SurveyMonkey between November 2019 and January 2020. Of 209 physicians who were contacted, 58 completed the survey; 62.1% treated primarily pediatric patients and 37.9% treated adults. Patient education on transition was regarded as "important" or "very important" by 94.2% of the physicians. Patients' knowledge about their disease and their ability to navigate the health care system were identified as 2 primary barriers to transition (mean 1.30 and 1.67 on a 3-point scale, respectively). Most physicians employ established models to facilitate the transition, including Got Transition (41.3%) and a biopsychosocial model (34.8%), with 34.8% using a mix of models and 23.9% not using an established model. Fewer than half (34.8%) rated their program as "very successful" or "successful." Transition protocols from pediatric to adult care should be re-examined to facilitate successful transition for AYA with SCD.
33461919	Gene therapy for hemoglobinopathies.	Beta hemoglobinopathies such as sickle cell disease (SCD) and beta-thalassemia (BT) are the most common monogenic diseases worldwide. Both diseases are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Because patients require lifelong follow-up and care, it also poses a serious burden in health services. Blood transfusions and/or drug therapy ameliorate the signs and symptoms of the disorders but are not curative. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is currently the only cure but it has several limitations including the paucity of human leukocyte antigen-matched related donors and a high risk of adverse events. Recent advances in hematopoietic stem cell based-gene therapy has made autologous HCT (auto-HCT) a reality. Clinical trials are underway using different gene transfer vectors and cassettes. Data obtained so far with a short-term follow-up has been very encouraging. Patients with SCD engrafted, had sustained production of the transgene and a decreased number of vaso-occlusive crises. Patients with BT were able to decrease the amount of transfusions required or stop transfusions all together. Adverse events observed were mostly associated with the myeloablative conditioning regimen. Long term data on gene persistence and toxicities are still needed. This review focuses on the current state of auto-HCT with gene therapy for SCD and BT. Current clinical trials and their outcome results are summarized.
32202245	Standard management of sickle cell disease complications.	Sickle cell disease remains a major public health concern in sub-Saharan Africa, Europe, and the United States. The survival rate of children and adolescents has increased immensely in developed countries, whereas the survival rate for adults lagged behind. The increase in the pediatric survival rate is attributable to the institution of hydroxyurea treatment as well as stroke prevention strategies. In this review, we discuss the management of the sickle disease major complications such as pain, stroke, and acute chest syndrome with the most current hydroxyurea use and transfusion therapy.
37595686	Treosulfan-based conditioning regimen in pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: A retrospective analysis on behalf of the Spanish Group for Hematopoietic Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (GETH-TC).	INTRODUCTION: Data on treosulfan-based conditioning regimens are little by little increasing, and the benefits of this approach are consistent, particularly regarding acute toxicity. This study aims to describe the results of treosulfan-based conditioning regimens in children, focusing on toxicity and outcomes when used to treat both malignant and non-malignant diseases. METHODS: Retrospective observational study on pediatric patients treated in Spain with treosulfan-based conditioning regimens before hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), based on data collection from electronic clinical records. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty treosulfan-based conditioning HSCTs to treat non-malignant diseases (n=117) or malignant diseases (n=43) in 158 children and adolescents are reported. Median age at HSCT was 5.1 years (IQR: 2-10). The most frequent diagnoses were primary immunodeficiency (n=42; 36%) and sickle cell disease (n=42; 36%) in the non-malignant cohort and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n=15; 35%) in the malignant cohort. Engraftment occurred in 97% of the patients. There was a longer median time to neutrophil engraftment (17 vs. 14 days; p=0.008) and platelet engraftment (20 vs. 15 days; p=0.002) in the non-malignant cohort. The 1-year cumulative incidence of VOD was 7.98 (95%CI [4.6-13.6]), with no significant differences between cohorts. The 1-year cumulative incidence of grade III-IV aGvHD was higher in the malignant cohort (18% vs. 3.2%; p=0.011). Overall, cGvHD was more frequently observed in the malignant cohort for both total incidence (9 vs. 3%; p<0.001) and 2-year cumulative incidence of total cGvHD (16 vs. 1.9%; p<0.001). The 2-year cumulative TRM was 15%, with no differences between cohorts. 5-year Overall Survival was 80% (95%CI [72-86]) and was higher in the non-malignant cohort (87 vs. 61%; p=0.01). The 2-year cumulative incidence of relapse in the malignant cohort was 25%. 5-year cumulative GRFS rate was 60% (95%CI [51-70]) and was higher in the non-malignant cohort (72 vs. 22%; p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The treosulfan-based radiation-free conditioning regimen is feasible, achieving a high engraftment rate and 5-year overall survival. A treosulfan-based conditioning regimen is an emerging option for the first HSCT in non-malignant diseases.
35617049	Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in hospitalized sickle cell disease and sickle cell trait patients.	INTRODUCTION: Sickle trait (Hb SA) or sickle disease (Hb SS) carries increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Hb SS patients are young and lack common comorbid conditions that qualify them for VTE prophylaxis (VTEP). METHODS: Retrospective, multicenter analysis of Hb SS/Hb SA adult patients between January 2013 and December 2018. RESULTS: There were 803 Hb SA (525 patients) and 1020 Hb SS admissions (262 patients). VTEP use was similar between Hb SA and controls (42% vs. 46%; p-value = .06) and Hb SS and controls (45% vs. 42%; p-value = .13). Hb SS/Hb SA patients more frequently received more than half of prescribed doses of VTEP. In multivariate analysis, increasing age and longer hospitalizations were positive predictors. Odds of VTEP use varied with treatment site for Hb SS patients, whereas comorbid conditions, admission hemoglobin and platelet count were not predictive. By contrast, in Hb SA patients, comorbid conditions, higher admission hemoglobin, and higher admission platelet counts raised the odds of VTEP being offered. CONCLUSIONS: VTEP is underused in Hb SS/Hb SA patients. There may be a trend toward offering more VTEP in Hb SS disease, but not in Hb SA patients, where VTEP prescribing is driven by comorbid conditions rather than genotype. Patient compliance does not appear to play a major role, but intercenter variability suggests provider education may improve VTEP use.
33779756	Feasibility of Medical Student Mentors to Improve Transition in Sickle Cell Disease.	OBJECTIVE: Advances in medical care have resulted in nearly 95% of all children with sickle cell disease (SCD) living to adulthood. There is a lack of effective transition programming, contributing to high rates of mortality and morbidity among adolescents and young adults (AYAs) during the transition from pediatric to adult healthcare. This nonrandomized study evaluated the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary outcomes of a novel medical student mentor intervention to improve transition outcomes for AYA with SCD. METHODS: Eligible participants were ages 18-25 years, either preparing for transition or had transferred to adult care within the past year. Twenty-four AYA with SCD (Mage = 20.3, SD = 2.6) enrolled in the program and were matched with a medical student mentor. Feasibility and acceptability of the intervention was assessed through enrollment rates, reasons for refusal, retention rates, engagement with the intervention, satisfaction, and reasons for drop-out. Dependent t-tests were used to evaluate the preliminary effects of the intervention on patient transition readiness, health-related quality of life, self-efficacy, SCD knowledge, medication adherence, and health literacy. RESULTS: Participants (N = 24) demonstrated adequate retention (75.0%), adherence to the intervention (M = 5.3 of 6 sessions), and satisfaction with the intervention components. Participants demonstrated significant improvements in transition readiness (p = .001), self-efficacy (p = .002), medication adherence (p = .02), and health literacy (p = .05). CONCLUSIONS: A medical student mentor intervention to facilitate transition from pediatric to adult care for AYA with SCD is both feasible and acceptable to patients and medical students. Preliminary results suggest benefits for patients, warranting a larger efficacy study.
32020146	Endocrinopathies complicating transfusion-dependent hemoglobinopathy.	OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence and significance of different endocrinopathies in children and adolescents with transfusion-dependent thalassemia and sickle-cell anemia. METHODS: This is a descriptive, retrospective study between January 2010 and July 2018 in King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Data was collected through reviewing electronic hospital medical records then filling out data collection sheets and was interpreted through the IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows version 20.0 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA). Results: The total sample size was 119 patients, gender equality was almost achieved with 55.5% being male and 45.5% being female. The most common endocrinopathies were identified in the following order of short stature (39.5%), diabetes mellitus (29.4%), hypogonadism (12.6%), osteopenia (12.6%), osteoporosis (9.2%), hypothyroidism (9.2%), hypocortisolism (3.4%), and hypoparathyroidism (2.5%). All of which were statistically significant in their relationship to hemoglobinopathies with the exception of osteopenia and osteoporosis. Hypogonadism and hypocortisolism were found to be statistically significant in their relationship to a positive history of splenectomy at p=0.026 and p=0.012. Short stature was found to be statistically significant in its relationship to the male gender with a p=0.001. Conclusion: Endocrinopathy is a frequent complication of hemoglobinopathies, for which the most common were found to be short stature, diabetes mellitus,  and low bone mineral density.
32039737	Impact of a paediatric-adult care transition programme on the health status of patients with sickle cell disease: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial (the DREPADO trial).	BACKGROUND: Thanks to advancements in medical care, a majority of patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) worldwide live beyond 18 years of age, and therefore, patients initially followed in paediatric departments are then transferred to adult departments. This paediatric-adult care transition is a period with an increased risk of discontinuity of care and subsequent morbidity and mortality. During this period, the patient will have to manage new interlocutors and places of care, and personal issues related to the period of adolescence. To take into consideration all these aspects, an interesting approach is to use the whole system approach to the patient, as presented in the biopsychosocial approach. The aim of this trial is to evaluate the impact of the proposed biopsychosocial paediatric-adult transition programme. METHODS: The DREPADO study is a multicentre randomised control trial comparing a control group (Arm A) to an interventional group with a paediatric-adult transition programme based on a biopsychosocial approach (Arm B). To be included, patients should have the SS, SC, or Sbeta form of sickle cell disease and be aged between 16 and 17 years. The randomisation in a 1:1 ratio assigns to Arm A or B. The primary outcome is the number of hospital admissions and emergencies for complications in the index hospital, in the 2 years after the first consultation in the adult department of care. Secondary outcomes consider the quality of life, but also include coping skills such as sense of self-efficacy and disease knowledge. To provide patient and parent knowledge and coping skills, the transition programme is composed of three axes: educational, psychological, and social, conducted individually and in groups. DISCUSSION: By providing self-care knowledge and coping skills related to SCD and therapeutics, helping empower patientsin relation to pain management and emotions, and facilitating the relationship to oneself, others, and care in Arm B of the DREPADO study, we believe that the morbidity and mortality of patients with SCD may be reduced after the proposed paediatric-adult transition programme.

37498339	The use of extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) in treating osteonecrosis of the femoral head (AVNFH): a retrospective study.	PURPOSE: As most of the cases of avascular necrosis (AVN) in Saudi Arabia is seen in young population and as literature showed good effect of extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) in reducing pain and oedema in avascular necrosis and delaying the need of surgical intervention. Our purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of ESWT in reducing pain, improving range of motion (ROM) and delaying the surgical intervention in patient with AVN of femoral head and compare our results to published literature. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We have treated 24 patients, 13 males and 11 females with a mean age of 29 years (range 14-48) with 34 hips affected. There were 14 unilateral and ten bilateral lesions. In our series 11 out of 24 patients (45.8%) were due to sickle cell disease. Other causes included idiopathic in five patients (20.8%), corticosteroids use and systemic lupus erythematous in three patients each (12.5% each) and post-traumatic AVN in two patients (8.3%). Extracorporeal shock wave therapy was implanted in FICAT stage I, II and III. All patients had two sessions of extracorporeal shock wave therapy, four to six weeks apart, each with 4000 impulses divided into four points. Radiological and MRI assessment were performed at regular time intervals with a minimum follow-up of two years. Clinical assessment was based on Visual Analog Scale and Harris Hip Score (HHS). The end point outcome measurement was the need for any operative intervention. RESULTS: Operative intervention was necessary in eight out of 34 hips (23.5%), within an average of 2.5 years (range 1 to 5 years). A hip salvage was achieved in 76.5%. Function was improved with the Harris Hip Score from a mean of 54.6 to 80.4 (P value using paired t test <= 0.05). Pain assessed with Visual Analog Scale improved from 5.73 to 2.75 (P value using paired t test <= 0.05). CONCLUSION: We do recommend the use of ESWT in treating AVN of bone whether of femoral head or other sites prior to the collapse of the articular surface. Further studies are needed to compare using two or more sessions as well as using four or six points for ESWT.
38037041	Opioid prescriptions among the World Trade Center Health Program population.	BACKGROUND: The World Trade Center Health Program (Program) provides limited health care to those directly affected by the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Because of physical/mental trauma arising from the 9/11 attacks, Program members might be at high risk of opioid use. To prevent prescription opioid overuse, in 2018 the Program implemented various measures to improve opioid prescribing and expand access to non-opioid pain management among Program members. However, the characteristics of opioid prescriptions dispensed among this population has never been described. METHODS: Administrative and claims data from 07/01/2011 to 09/30/2022 were used to describe opioid prescriptions dispensed during 2013-2021. RESULTS: From 2013-2021, 108,285 members were Program-enrolled for >= 10 months, 4,053 (3.7%) had 22,938 outpatient opioid prescriptions, of which, 62.1% were for cancer-related pain, 11.1% for hospice/end of life care, 4.8% for surgery pain, and 9.8% for acute/chronic pain. Among members with Program-paid diagnostic/treatment claims (n = 70,721), the proportion with opioid prescriptions for cancer/hospice/end of life care increased from 0.5% in 2013 to 1.6% in 2018 (p = 0.010), then decreased to 1.1% in 2021 (p = 0.070), and the proportion for non-cancer surgery/acute/chronic pain decreased from 0.6% in 2013 to 0.23% in 2021 (p = 0.0005). Among members prescribed opioids without cancer/hospice/sickle cell disease, the proportion who started with long-acting opioids or had opioid prescriptions from >= 4 prescribers were below 6.5% annually; the proportion receiving a high-dose (>= 90 morphine milligram equivalents per day [MED]), or with concurrent opioids and benzodiazepines use, or who started opioids with MED >= 50 or with long duration (>= 7 days' supply) were above 10% annually, but decreased since 2017. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of outpatient opioid prescriptions paid by the Program was very low and prescriptions were primarily dispensed for cancer/hospice/end of life care. Although Program efforts to improve opioid prescribing coincided with improvements in outcomes, ongoing surveillance is needed.
32147964	Impact of Medicaid expansion on access and healthcare among individuals with sickle cell disease.	PURPOSE: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is associated with high acute healthcare utilization. The purpose of this study was to examine whether Medicaid expansion in California increased Medicaid enrollment, increased hydroxyurea prescriptions filled, and decreased acute healthcare utilization in SCD. METHODS: Individuals with SCD (<=65 years and enrolled in Medicaid for >=6 total calendar months any year between 2011 and 2016) were identified in a multisource database maintained by the California Sickle Cell Data Collection Program. We describe trends and changes in Medicaid enrollment, hydroxyurea prescriptions filled, and emergency department (ED) visits and hospital admissions before (2011-2013) and after (2014-2016) Medicaid expansion in California. RESULTS: The cohort included 3635 individuals. Enrollment was highest in 2014 and lowest in 2016 with a 2.8% annual decease postexpansion. Although <20% of the cohort had a hydroxyurea prescription filled, the percentage increased by 5.2% annually after 2014. The ED visit rate was highest in 2014 and decreased slightly in 2016, decreasing by 1.1% annually postexpansion. Hospital admission rates were similar during the pre- and postexpansion periods. Young adults and adults had higher ED and hospital admission rates than children and adolescents. CONCLUSIONS: Medicaid expansion does not appear to have improved enrollment or acute healthcare utilization among individuals with SCD in California. Future studies should explore whether individuals with SCD transitioned to other insurance plans or became uninsured postexpansion, the underlying reasons for low hydroxyurea utilization, and the lack of effect on hospital admissions despite a modest effect on ED visits.
35181561	Reduction in the Prevalence of Thrombotic Events in Sickle Cell Disease after Allogeneic Hematopoietic Transplantation.	Thrombosis is a recognized complication in sickle cell disease (SCD). Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) remains the sole curative option for patients with severe SCD phenotypes. Data describing the effects of allo-HCT on recurrent thrombotic events (venous and arterial events) are limited, however. We evaluated 31 patients with SCD who underwent allo-HCT with a median follow-up of 34.5 months (range, 13 to 115) post-transplantation. No patient continued anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy after allo-HCT. There was an absolute difference of 32% (95% confidence interval [CI], 12.3% to 32.2%; P = .002) in the prevalence of venous thromboembolic (VTE) events before and after allo-HSCT. In addition, there was an absolute difference of 38.5% (95% CI, 10.63 to 45.96; P = .006) in the number of ischemic cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) occurring before and after allo-HSCT. Patients with severe SCD who undergo allo-HCT are less likely to develop recurrent thrombotic events compared with a control cohort of patients matched for age and genotype (odds ratio, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.058 to 0.83; P = .025). Following curative therapy with allo-HCT, there is a reduction in recurrent arterial and venous thrombosis in patients with severe SCD phenotypes.
38702922	Immunization adherence among children with sickle cell disease and sickle cell trait: Results of a population-based study.	INTRODUCTION: Despite the importance of timely vaccine completion for protection from infectious disease, there is limited knowledge of the immunization adherence rates of children with sickle cell disease (SCD). METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study comparing the immunization rates of children with SCD to those with sickle cell trait between 2008 and 2019 in Georgia. Completion rates for each vaccine and the proportion of children with up-to-date status at 24 and 35 months were calculated and compared between the cohorts. Chi-square tests with odds ratios (OR) for differences and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported on the overall up-to-date rates and rates for individual vaccines at 24 and 35 months for the two cohorts. RESULTS: Children with SCD had higher up-to-date rates than children with sickle cell trait at 24 and 35 months. At 35 months, the overall up-to-date rates (OR = 1.17; 95% CI, 1.04-1.31; p = .004) and the four-dose pneumococcal conjugate vaccine series (OR = 1.36; 95% CI, 1.18-1.57; p < .001) were significantly different between the groups. Both cohorts had the highest completion rates for the hepatitis B series and the lowest rates for the varicella vaccine. Doses of diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis vaccine; varicella; and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines were most commonly missed by children in both cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Children with SCD have better immunization coverage than children with sickle cell trait, but there is an opportunity for improvement. Policymakers and healthcare professionals should focus on increasing access to care coordination services among children with SCD to ensure on-time and preventive healthcare services.
37318395	A systematic review of clinical trials for gene therapies for beta-hemoglobinopathy around the world.	BACKGROUND AIMS: Amidst the success of cell therapy for the treatment of onco-hematological diseases, the first recently Food and Drug Administration-approved gene therapy product for patients with transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia (TDT) indicates the feasibility of gene therapy as curative for genetic hematologic disorders. This work analyzed the current-world scenario of clinical trials involving gene therapy for beta-hemoglobinopathies. METHODS: Eighteen trials for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and 24 for patients with TDT were analyzed. RESULTS: Most are phase 1 and 2 trials, funded by the industry and are currently recruiting volunteers. Treatment strategies for both diseases are fetal hemoglobin induction (52.4%); addition of wild-type or therapeutic beta-globin gene (38.1%) and correction of mutations (9,5%). Gene editing (52.4%) and gene addition (40.5%) are the two most used techniques. The United States and France are the countries with the greatest number of clinical trials centers for SCD, with 83.1% and 4.2%, respectively. The United States (41.1%), China (26%) and Italy (6.8%) lead TDT trials centers. CONCLUSIONS: Geographic trial concentration indicates the high costs of this technology, logistical issues and social challenges that need to be overcome for gene therapy to reach low- and middle-income countries where SCD and TDT are prevalent and where they most impact the patient's health.
33852506	Peripartum considerations in sickle cell disease.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Pregnancy exacerbates sickle cell disease (SCD) and is associated with increased frequency and severity of complications resulting in high levels of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. We review recent recommendations for managing SCD in pregnancy. RECENT FINDINGS: An updated pathobiological model of SCD now attributes the clinical picture to a vicious cycle of four major cellular disturbances. Management decisions should be guided by an understanding of this upgraded model. Red cell transfusions are a key therapeutic intervention used in managing several acute and chronic complications. Transfusion however has significant drawbacks. The American Society of Hematology recently published transfusion guidelines to support care providers. SUMMARY: Patients should be managed by a multidisciplinary and experienced team. The perioperative episode is a recognized period of disease exacerbation and informed anesthetic management can contribute to improved patient outcomes.
35082243	Identifying and Treating Severe Bone Marrow Necrosis and Fat Embolism Syndrome in Pediatric Patients With Sickle Cell Disease: A Case Report.	Fat embolism syndrome after bone marrow necrosis is an extremely rare complication in sickle cell disease associated with significant morbidity and mortality. A high index of suspicion is required for diagnosis. This case report will assist pediatric clinicians and hematologists to recognize this severe complication in patients with sickle cell disease and to promptly initiate treatment. Red flags include severe bone pain, respiratory distress, neurological impairment, decreasing platelet count, peripheral leukocyte left shift, elevated nucleated red blood cells, and significant elevation in plasma ferritin and lactate dehydrogenase. We report a pediatric patient who was diagnosed early, received urgent red cell exchange transfusion and plasma exchange, and ultimately survived this devastating complication.
34986133	Development and Validation of Pediatric Opioid Analgesia Self-Instruction System (PedOASIS): An Opioid Knowledge Tool for Pediatric Clinicians.	BACKGROUND: Acute pain is common in children and young adults with cancer and sickle cell disease. Current training curricula fail to adequately impart skills for pain management. We sought to develop and validate an education and assessment tool to address the safe effective use of opioids for pain management by pediatrics trainees. METHODS: The first version of the tool contained 10 case-based, multiple-choice questions. It was pilot tested within a medium-sized pediatric residency program using preintervention and postintervention surveys to assess residents' knowledge and comfort related to prescribing opioids. Content validation was performed through an expert panel of physicians. Internal reliability was tested by administering the tool to learners and practitioners with varying levels of training. RESULTS: Comfort with choosing and converting between opioids increased significantly in pilot testing (P=0.005). Mean objective knowledge scores increased from 51% to 85.9% (P<0.001). The revised tool showed internal reliability within each group (Cronbach alpha 0.71 to 0.78) and significant differences in mean scores between groups (F ratio=9.45, P=0.0002). CONCLUSIONS: This tool demonstrates validity and internal reliability. Its use was associated with short-term educational gains and it garnered overall favorable feedback from users. Further testing is needed to assess the duration of these gains.
36661087	Hospital and ICU Admission Risk Associated With Comorbidities Among Children With COVID-19 Ancestral Strains.	A large proportion of children have been affected by COVID-19; we evaluated the association between comorbidities and hospitalization/ICU (intensive care unit) admission among 4097 children under age 21 years with symptomatic COVID-19 (not just polymerase chain reaction [PCR]-positive or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children associated with COVID-19 [MIS-C]) from 2 large health systems from March 2020 to September 2021. Significant comorbidities and demographic factors identified by univariable analysis were included in a multivariable logistic regression compared with children ages 6 to 11 without comorbidities. In all, 475 children (11.6%) were hospitalized, of whom 25.5% required ICU admission. Children under 1 year had high hospitalization risk, but low risk of ICU admission. Presence of at least 1 comorbidity was associated with hospitalization and ICU admission (odds ratio [OR] > 4). Asthma, obesity, chronic kidney disease, sickle cell disease, bone marrow transplantation, and neurologic disorders were associated with hospitalization (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] > 2). Malignancy, intellectual disability, and prematurity were associated with ICU admission (AOR > 4). Comorbidities are significantly associated with hospitalization/ICU admission among children with COVID-19.
36379441	Optimal predelivery hemoglobin to reduce transfusion and adverse perinatal outcomes.	BACKGROUND: Maternal anemia has been associated with poor obstetrical outcomes; however, the optimal hemoglobin level for reducing blood transfusion at delivery has not been well-defined. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to measure the association of maternal anemia immediately before delivery with peripartum transfusion and other adverse perinatal outcomes. We also sought to identify the optimal hemoglobin level for predicting transfusion. STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective cohort study of patients who had hemoglobin or hematocrit collected before delivery of live, nonanomalous neonates at >=23 weeks' gestation at a single center (2013-2018). Patients were excluded if they had sickle cell disease or were receiving anticoagulation. Patients were categorized as having anemia or no anemia on the basis of predelivery hemoglobin or hematocrit levels using criteria set by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. The primary outcome was transfusion of >=1 unit of packed red blood cells during the delivery admission. Secondary outcomes included select adverse perinatal outcomes. Bivariable analyses compared baseline characteristics and outcomes between the anemia and no-anemia groups. Multivariable logistic regression estimated the association between anemia and outcomes. The hemoglobin cutoff optimizing sensitivity and specificity for transfusion was identified by the Liu method. RESULTS: Of the 18,357 patients included in the analysis, 5444 (30%) had predelivery anemia (mean hemoglobin, 10.0+-0.8 g/dL) vs 12,913 (70%) who did not (mean hemoglobin, 12.3+-1.1 g/dL). Patients with anemia were more likely to be non-Hispanic Black and publicly insured and less likely to be nulliparous. Anemia was associated with 5-fold higher odds of packed red blood cell transfusion (6.0% vs 1.3%; adjusted odds ratio, 5.23 [95% confidence interval, 4.09-6.69]) compared with no anemia. For each 1 g/dL increase in predelivery hemoglobin, the odds of transfusion were 56% lower (adjusted odds ratio, 0.44 [confidence interval, 0.40-0.48]). The optimal hemoglobin for prediction of transfusion was 10.6 g/dL (sensitivity: 80%, specificity: 86%). There was no association between anemia and composite maternal or neonatal morbidity after adjustment for covariates, but anemia was associated with higher odds of postpartum readmission (adjusted odds ratio, 1.35 [1.11-1.64]). CONCLUSION: Maternal anemia before delivery was associated with 5-fold higher odds of packed red blood cell transfusion and postpartum readmission, but not other perinatal morbidity. Optimizing predelivery hemoglobin, particularly >=10.6 g/dL, may reduce peripartum transfusion.

33626864	Chronic organ injuries in children with sickle cell disease.	Median life expectancy of patients with sickle cell disease has increased to up to 55 years but there are still frequent cases of premature death, mostly in patients with pre-existing organ failure such as pulmonary hypertension, kidney injury, and cerebral vasculopathy. Most organ injuries remain asymptomatic for a long time and can only be detected through early systematic screening. Protocols combining assessment of velocities on transcranial Doppler and regular transfusions in patients with abnormal velocities have been demonstrated to dramatically reduce the risk of stroke. In contrast, no consensus has been reached on systematic screening or therapy for silent cerebral infarcts. The prognostic significance of increased tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity on echocardiography has not yet been identified in children, whereas increased albuminuria is a good predictor of kidney injury. Finally, screening for hip and eye disorder is recommended; however, different countries adopt different screening strategies. Hydroxyurea is probably of potential benefit in preventing chronic organ damage but this requires further study in order to be fully demonstrated. Efficacy and safety of the other new drugs available are also under investigation.

35094801	Health State Utilities for Sickle Cell Disease: A Catalog Prepared From a Systematic Review.	OBJECTIVES: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a complex, chronic condition that impairs health-related quality of life of affected individuals and their caregivers. As curative therapies emerge, comprehensive cost-effectiveness models will inform their value. These models will require descriptions of health states and their corresponding utility values that accurately reflect health-related quality of life over the disease trajectory. The objectives of this systematic review were to develop a catalog of health state utility (HSU) values for SCD, identify research gaps, and provide future directions for preference elicitation. METHODS: Records were identified through searches of PubMed and Embase, Tufts Medical Center Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry, reference lists of relevant articles, and consultation with SCD experts (2008-2020). We removed duplicate records and excluded ineligible studies. For included studies, we summarized the study characteristics, methods used for eliciting HSUs, and HSU values. RESULTS: Five studies empirically elicited utilities using indirect methods (EQ-5D) (n = 3) and Short Form-6 Dimension (n = 2); these represent health states associated with general SCD (n = 1), SCD complications (n = 2), and SCD treatments (n = 3). Additionally, we extracted HSUs from 7 quality-adjusted life-years-based outcome research studies. The HSU among patients with general SCD without specifying complications ranged from 0.64 to 0.887. Only 36% of the HSUs used in the quality-adjusted life-year-based outcomes research studies were derived from individuals with SCD. No study estimated HSUs in caregivers. CONCLUSIONS: There is a dearth of literature of HSUs for use in SCD models. Future empirical studies should elicit a comprehensive set of HSUs from individuals with SCD and their caregivers.
32544526	Red blood cell alloimmunisation after platelet transfusion (excluding ABO blood group system).	Red blood cell alloimmunisation after transfusion of red blood cell concentrates carries a risk for every recipient. This risk is particularly high for patients with conditions such as sickle cell disease. However, red blood cell alloimmunisation can also occur after platelet concentrate transfusion. All blood group systems other than ABO are affected, and there are several mechanisms responsible for this alloimmunisation. The practical implications of this are a need to match red blood cell concentrates in all alloimmunised patients and, in pregnant women, recongnition of the risk of developing haemolytic disease of the foetus and newborn. Several measures can be taken to prevent alloimmunisation: in the case of the D antigen, for example, anti-RhD immunoglobulins can be infused before transfusing platelet concentrates from an RhD-positive donor in a RhD-negative recipient.
32404689	Teaching Versus Nonteaching Hospitals: Where Children With Sickle Cell Disease Receive Their Emergency Department Care.	
32569034	Emergency Department Provider Survey Regarding Acute Sickle Cell Pain Management.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) can lead to potentially devastating complications that occur secondary to vaso-occlusion. Current national clinical guidelines are largely based on expert opinion, resulting in significant variation of management. Provider awareness regarding emergency department (ED) management of vaso-occlusive crises (VOC) remains unknown. A 23-question assessment of VOC management was administered to all eligible ED providers at Riley Hospital for Children between September and November 2018. Univariate analyses were performed to evaluate responses between groups. Of 52 respondents comprised of ED staff attendings (27%), resident trainees (58%), and ED nurses (15%), the majority were not aware of SCD management guidelines being available. Approximately 54% of providers endorsed a high comfort level in managing VOC, with staff and nurses more likely to report this than trainees (P=0.02). Less than 10% of all providers knew the recommended timeframe from triage to initial medication administration. Prolonged time between pain assessments was reported by 25% of providers with a high comfort level in managing VOC, which was similar to providers with a lower comfort level (13%, P=0.217). Only one fourth of all respondents appropriately did not use vital signs as an indication of a patient's pain level, and >10% reported not utilizing patient-reported pain scores. This was not significantly different between provider comfort levels (P=0.285 and 0.412, relatively). Our results suggest education regarding recommended practices was inadequate regardless of reported provider comfort. Further provider education and/or standardized ED VOC management guidelines may serve as areas for improvement in SCD care.
34294508	Provider Attitudes, Preferences, and Practices Regarding Sexual and Reproductive Health for Adolescents and Young Adults With Sickle Cell Disease.	PURPOSE: With improvements in life expectancy, adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with sickle cell disease (SCD) increasingly face sexual and reproductive health (SRH) concerns. As subspecialists often serve as primary care providers for those with chronic disease, this study examines pediatric SCD providers' practices and attitudes related to SRH of AYA women with SCD. METHODS: We developed an adapted survey to identify SCD provider attitudes and practices in addressing menses, sexual activity, contraception, and pregnancy for their female patients. We electronically distributed this survey to the American Society of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology SCD interest group. We used descriptive statistics to analyze results. RESULTS: A total of 78 pediatric SCD providers completed the survey. A majority (95%) rated SRH discussions as moderately important or higher, with 89% agreeing this care should be standardized. Most respondents reported discussing SRH, such as menses (78%), teratogenic medications (61%), and contraception (90%), with their female patients with SCD at least annually. Although most refer AYAs with SCD for birth control (83%), 39% endorsed a preferred method, with 33% of these favoring levonorgestrel intrauterine devices in this population and 40% injectable contraception. Approximately half of respondents (57%) reported that the use of combined hormonal contraceptives was unacceptable despite published guidelines that support potential benefits outweighing theoretical risk in AYAs with SCD. CONCLUSIONS: The range of SRH conversations and contraceptive recommendations for AYAs from pediatric SCD providers is broad. SCD providers and AYAs with SCD would benefit from improved evidence and educational resources related to contraception as well as coordinated SRH counseling.
34881428	Perinatal outcomes in women with sickle cell disease: a matched cohort study from London, UK.	There are limited data on contemporary outcomes for women with sickle cell disease (SCD) in pregnancy. We conducted a single-site matched cohort study, comparing 131 pregnancies to women with SCD between 2007 and 2017 to a comparison group of 1310 pregnancies unaffected by SCD. Restricting our analysis to singleton pregnancies that reached 24 weeks of gestation, we used conditional Poisson regression to estimate adjusted risk ratios (aRRs) for perinatal outcomes. Infants born to mothers with SCD were more likely to be small for gestational age [aRR 1 69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1 13-2 48], preterm (aRR 2 62, 95% CI 1 82-3 78) and require Neonatal Unit (NNU) admission (aRR 3 59, 95% CI 2 18-5 90). Pregnant women with SCD were at higher risk of pre-eclampsia/eclampsia (aRR 3 53, 95% CI 2 00-6 24), more likely to receive induction of labour (aRR 2 50, 95% CI 1 82-1 76) and caesarean birth (aRR 1 44, 95% CI 1 18-1 76). In analysis stratified by genotype, the risk of adverse outcomes was highest in haemoglobin SS (HbSS) pregnancies (n = 80). There was no strong evidence that haemoglobin SC (HbSC) pregnancies (n = 46) were at higher risk of preterm birth, caesarean delivery, or NNU admission. Pre-eclampsia/eclampsia was more frequently observed in HbSC pregnancies. Despite improvements in the care of pregnant women with SCD, the increased risk of adverse perinatal outcomes remains.
36261305	A Novel Measure of Pain Location in Adults with Sickle Cell Disease.	BACKGROUND: Pain intensity remains a primary focus clinically for sickle cell disease pain assessment despite the fact that pain quality and pain location and distribution are critical for clinical diagnosis and treatment of its etiology. However, in part because of measurement issues, scant evidence is available about pain location or its relationship to intensity and quality in adults with SCD. AIM: Our study aim was to examine sickle cell disease pain location for relationships with pain quality and intensity measured in outpatient and inpatient settings. METHODS: We used an existing longitudinal dataset prospectively collected with the valid and reliable tablet-based PAINReportIt(R). Adults with sickle cell disease (n = 99) reported pain location, intensity, and quality during a routine outpatient clinic visit and again during a subsequent hospitalization. From their digital body outline drawings and using the ImageJ software, we computed the pain-affected body surface area. With Pearson's correlations and paired t tests, we examined relationships between pain-affected body surface area and other pain variables across outpatient and inpatient visits. RESULTS: The mean pain-affected body surface area was 14.4% +- 15.0% of the total body surface area for outpatient visits (min-max: 0.0%-90.2%) and 13.5% +- 14.7% (min-max: 0.0%-73.0%) for inpatient stay. Pain-affected body surface area was positively correlated with pain quality scores for both visits but not significantly correlated with pain intensity at either visit. Compared with the outpatient visit, mean pain intensity for inpatient stay was higher (p < .001); pain quality (p = .12) and pain-affected body surface area (p = .60) did not differ significantly between visits. CONCLUSIONS: Unknown is the explanation for pain-affected body surface area association with SCD pain quality but not pain intensity at outpatient and inpatient visits. Additional research is warranted to explore these findings and examine the clinical utility of pain-affected body surface area for chronic sickle cell disease pain and acute sickle cell disease crisis pain.
36705266	Immunological efficacy of pneumococcal vaccination including the 13-valent pneumococcal vaccine in adult patients with sickle-cell disease: results of the randomized DREVAC controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: Patients with sickle-cell disease (SCD) are at high risk for invasive pneumococcal diseases. The immunological efficacy of 13-valent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine (PCV13) followed by a 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) is poorly documented in adults with SCD. METHODS: This was a randomized open-labelled phase 2 study of the immunogenicity of PCV13 at week (W)0, followed by PPSV23 at W4, compared to PPSV23 alone at W4 in adult patients with SCD. The proportion of responders (four-fold increase of serotype-specific IgG antibodies) to at least 10-shared serotypes was assessed at W8. Secondary endpoints were: i) geometrical mean titers (GMTs), ii) responders to 0-1, 2-5, 6-9, and 10-12 serotypes, iii) pneumococcal opsonophagocytic (OPA) activity, and iv) response durability at W24 and W96. RESULTS: In total, 128 patients were randomized in the PCV13/PPSV23 (n=63) or PPSV23-alone groups (n=65). At W8, 24.56% and 8.20% of patients from the PCV13/PPSV23 and PPSV23 groups, respectively, reached the primary endpoint (p=0.016). These numbers were 36.2% and 8.7% for OPA responders (p=0.002). A combined PCV13/PPSV23 strategy improved the breadth of responses to 0-1, 2-5, 6-9, and 10-12 serotypes with 15.8%, 35%, 24.6%, and 24.6% versus 52.5%, 31%, 8%, and 8% in the PPSV23 group. At W96, GMTs were significantly higher in the PCV13/PPSV23 than in the PPSV23 alone group for five serotypes (4, 14, 19A, 19F, 23F). CONCLUSIONS: A PCV13/PPSV23 regimen improved the breadth and magnitude of antibody responses against a large range of pneumococcal serotypes in adults with SCD. The sustainability of the immune response requires recall strategies.Clinical Trial Registration: NCT02274415.
35180761	Introduction of Hydroxyurea Therapy to a Cohort of Sickle Cell Patients in Northern Haiti.	Although the prevalence of sickle cell anemia is high in Haiti, treatment with hydroxyurea (HU) is uncommon. HU therapy was started at a hospital in Northern Haiti for children and young adults who had presented with complications of their disease. The patients were followed in clinic for their response to therapy and the principal outcome was hospitalization for complications. There was a 70% decrease in the rate of hospitalization in the cohort with no significant complications or deaths during the study period. Treatment with HU is a proven therapy that reduces the morbidity associated with sickle cell anemia and efforts should be made to assure access and affordability in regions with a high prevalence.

33193339	Mesenchymal Stromal Cells in Pediatric Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation a Review and a Pilot Study in Children Treated With Decidua Stromal Cells for Acute Graft-versus-Host Disease.	Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are rare precursors in all organs of the body. MSCs have profound anti-inflammatory effects and reduce alloreactivity in vitro and in vivo. In pediatric allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), MSCs have mainly been used to treat acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). MSCs are commercially available for this indication in Canada, Japan, and New Zeeland. More rare indications for MSCs in pediatric patients include graft failure and chronic GVHD. MSCs from bone marrow, adipose tissue, umbilical cord, Wharton's jelly, placenta tissue, and decidua have been used, but the optimal clinical stromal cell source has not been compared in clinical trials. More experimental clinical indications using MSCs, such as sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, hemorrhages, pneumo-mediastinum, and neuroinflammation have primarily been explored in animal models or adult HCT patients. MSCs have almost no if any side-effects. In this pilot study we report the outcome of six children treated with decidua stromal cells (DSCs) for steroid refractory acute GVHD. At 6 months, complete response was seen in four patients and partial response in two patients. One child with high-risk ALL died from relapse and a boy with sickle cell disease died from a cerebral hemorrhage. Five-year survival was 67% and all survivors showed a Lansky score of 100%. To conclude, MSCs from various organs are well-tolerated and have shown an encouraging outcome for acute GVHD in pediatric patients.
33109398	Potent and orally active purine-based fetal hemoglobin inducers for treating beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease.	Reactivation of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) expression by therapeutic agents has been suggested as an alternative treatment to modulate anemia and the related symptoms of severe beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease (SCD). Hydroxyurea (HU) is the first US FDA-approved HbF inducer for treating SCD. However, approximately 25% of the patients with SCD do not respond to HU. A previous study identified TN1 (1) as a small-molecule HbF inducer. However, this study found that the poor potency and oral bioavailability of compound 1 limits the development of this inducer for clinical use. To develop drug-like compounds, further structure-activity relationship studies on the purine-based structure of 1 were conducted. Herein, we report our discovery of a more potent inducer, compound 13a, that can efficiently induce gamma-globin gene expression at non-cytotoxic concentrations. The molecular mechanism of 13a, for the regulation HbF expression, was also investigated. In addition, we demonstrated that oral administration of 13a can ameliorate anemia and the related symptoms in SCD mice. The results of this study suggest that 13a can be further developed as a novel agent for treating hemoglobinopathies, such as beta-thalassemia and SCD.
35810055	[Acute chest syndrome in adult sickle cell patients].	Sickle cell disease is a frequent genetic condition, due to a mutation of the beta-globin gene, leading to the production of an abnormal S hemoglobin and characterized by multiple vaso-occlusive events. The acute chest syndrome is a severe complication associated with a significant disability and mortality. It is defined by the association of one or more clinical respiratory manifestations and a new infiltrate on lung imaging. Its pathophysiology is complex and implies vaso-occlusive phenomena (pulmonary vascular thrombosis, fat embolism), infection, and alveolar hypoventilation. S/S or S/beta0-thalassemia genotype, a history of vaso-occlusive crisis or acute chest syndrome, a low F hemoglobin level (<5%), a high steady-state hemoglobin level (> 10 g/dL), or a high steady-state leukocytosis (>10 G/L) are the main risk factors. Febrile chest pain, dyspnea, sometimes cough with expectorations are its main clinical manifestations, and bi-basal crackles are found at auscultation. Inferior alveolar opacities with or without pleural effusions are identified on chest X-ray or CT-scan. Management of the acute chest syndrome should be prompt and implies, besides the recognition of severity signs, a multimodal analgesia, oxygen supplementation, sometimes a parenteral antibiotic treatment and the frequent use of blood transfusions especially in the most severe cases. Prevention is important and includes a regular monitoring of hospitalized patients and the use of incentive spirometry.
35659126	Liver Transplantation After Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant for the Treatment of Sickle Cell Disease: A Case Report.	Sickle cell anemia is the most common of the hemoglobinopathies, in which the abnormal hemoglobin formed in deoxygenation states undergoes a polymerization process with consequent erythrocyte deformation and vaso-occlusive events. The need for multiple blood transfusions, prolonged ineffective erythropoiesis, hemolysis, and increased iron absorption can cause iron overload in the liver, leading to liver fibrosis. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is currently the only treatment with a curative potential for this disease and can establish normal complete or partial donor-derived erythropoiesis and stabilize or restore function in affected organs, preventing further deterioration of function. However, it does not reverse preexisting liver fibrosis and siderosis. One of the possible complications of patients who undergo HSCT is chronic liver disease, which has a multifactorial cause, with iron overload being an important factor. In the long term, the prevalence of chronic liver disease in HSCT patients, including cirrhosis and its complications, can be significant. Solid organ transplantation after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation for end-organ failure remains a very rare event. It may offer a valuable treatment strategy in selected recipients, although it is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. We report the case of a patient with sickle cell anemia who underwent HSCT and developed severe liver dysfunction requiring liver transplantation 13 years after the procedure. We found no previous report in the literature of orthotopic liver transplant after HCT for the treatment of sickle cell disease.
38582651	Utility of hemoglobin electrophoresis to distinguish between severe delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction versus hyperhemolysis syndrome.	Delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction (DHTR) and hyperhemolysis syndrome (HHS) are both complications of red blood cell transfusions in patients with sickle cell disease.Clinically, both present with hemolysis and can be difficult to differentiate. Hemoglobin electrophoresis may aid in the diagnosis. Herein we describe a case in which a patient with hemoglobin SC disease presented with features of severe hemolysis several days after initiation of red blood cell exchange. Increase in reticulocyte count and complete absence of hemoglobin A on electrophoresis during this event supported the diagnosis of severe DHTR, indicating a rapid and selective destruction of the transfused red blood cells. Ability to interpret the hemoglobin electrophoresis can help clinicians distinguish between these two severe transfusion complications in patients living with sickle cell disease. It is important to identify the presence or absence of concomitant HHS, as patients with HHS tend to have a worse prognosis and there is a higher rate of recurrence of HHS with subsequent transfusions. Accurate diagnosis can lead to prompt management and decrease morbidity and mortality.
32583456	Red cell exchange for patients with sickle cell disease: an international survey of current practices.	INTRODUCTION: Red cell exchange (RCE) therapy is increasingly used to treat patients with acute or chronic manifestations of sickle cell disease (SCD). However, little is known regarding the most safe and effective practice parameters associated with this particular therapy. METHODS: A SCD subcommittee of members of the American Society for Apheresis (ASFA) developed a 122-question survey and administered it via email to other ASFA members. The survey inquired about clinical indications for treatment, practice patterns, and transfusion policies for RCE when used for patients with SCD. RESULTS: Ninety-nine distinct institutions completed the survey. Twenty-one (21%) were from outside of the US. Twenty-two (22%) provided chronic transfusion therapy to >10 patients, and both adult (25%) and pediatric-focused services (20%) were represented. Common acute indications for RCE included acute chest syndrome, acute ischemic stroke, and pre-surgical prophylaxis. Common chronic indications included primary stroke prophylaxis, secondary stroke prophylaxis, and recurrent acute chest syndrome. Respondents most commonly set a post-RCE treatment target of 30% for the hematocrit and hemoglobin S levels, regardless of the therapeutic indication. Units for RCE were phenotypically matched in 95% of cases. About 40% of respondents reported using isovolemic hemodilution. CONCLUSIONS: This survey solicited the current practice variations in RCE from a diverse range of practice sites. Many sites reported similar practice patterns and challenges but some variations emerged. To our knowledge, this survey represents the largest and most in-depth investigation of the use of RCE for patients with SCD, and could inform future studies in the field.
33632759	Mortality and Access to Kidney Transplantation in Patients with Sickle Cell Disease-Associated Kidney Failure.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Patients with sickle cell disease-associated kidney failure have high mortality, which might be lowered by kidney transplantation. However, because they show higher post-transplant mortality compared with patients with other kidney failure etiologies, kidney transplantation remains controversial in this population, potentially limiting their chance of receiving transplantation. We aimed to quantify the decrease in mortality associated with transplantation in this population and determine the chance of receiving transplantation with sickle cell disease as the cause of kidney failure as compared with other etiologies of kidney failure. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Using a national registry, we studied all adults with kidney failure who began maintenance dialysis or were added to the kidney transplant waiting list in 1998-2017. To quantify the decrease in mortality associated with transplantation, we measured the absolute risk difference and hazard ratio for mortality in matched pairs of transplant recipients versus waitlisted candidates in the sickle cell and control groups. To compare the chance of receiving transplantation, we estimated hazard ratios for receiving transplantation in the sickle cell and control groups, treating death as a competing risk. RESULTS: Compared with their matched waitlisted candidates, 189 transplant recipients with sickle cell disease and 220,251 control recipients showed significantly lower mortality. The absolute risk difference at 10 years post-transplant was 20.3 (98.75% confidence interval, 0.9 to 39.8) and 19.8 (98.75% confidence interval, 19.2 to 20.4) percentage points in the sickle cell and control groups, respectively. The hazard ratio was also similar in the sickle cell (0.57; 95% confidence interval, 0.36 to 0.91) and control (0.54; 95% confidence interval, 0.53 to 0.55) groups (interaction P=0.8). Nonetheless, the sickle cell group was less likely to receive transplantation than the controls (subdistribution hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% confidence interval, 0.61 to 0.87). Similar disparities were found among waitlisted candidates (subdistribution hazard ratio, 0.62; 95% confidence interval, 0.53 to 0.72). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with sickle cell disease-associated kidney failure exhibited similar decreases in mortality associated with kidney transplantation as compared with those with other kidney failure etiologies. Nonetheless, the sickle cell population was less likely to receive transplantation, even after waitlist registration.
35927947	Pulmonary function in children and adolescents with sickle cell disease after nonmyeloablative hematopoietic cell transplantation.	BACKGROUND: Pulmonary complications are common in sickle cell disease (SCD). The use of standard myeloablative conditioning regimens may increase the risk of lung injury. We report serial pulmonary function testing (PFT) outcomes in children with SCD who underwent a matched-sibling donor hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) using nonmyeloablative (NMA) protocol. METHODS: This is a retrospective chart review describing pulmonary outcomes in pediatric patients post HCT. The conditioning regimen consisted of alemtuzumab and a single fraction of 300 cGy of total body irradiation (TBI), and sirolimus for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. Serial PFT testing was performed pre and post HCT. The evaluated pulmonary measures included: forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1 ), FEV1 /FVC, and forced expiratory flow (FEF25-75 ). RESULTS: Twelve subjects were included in the analysis. All had HbSS genotype, and five of the 12 patients had one or more episodes of acute chest syndrome prior to HCT. Serial PFT measures were completed per patient. No patient was diagnosed with chronic GVHD of any organ post HCT. The baseline median FVC, FEV1 , FEV1 /FVC, and FEF25-75 were within the normal range and remained relatively unchanged post HCT. A linear mixed effects model, adjusting for gender and time from HCT, suggested no significant relationship between HCT and PFT parameters, including FVC, FEV1 , and FEV1 /FVC. Interestingly, the FEF25-75 results exhibited a shift in the means post HCT (pre-HCT 86.2% predicted and post-HCT 93.05% predicted, p-value = .018). CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that HCT in children with SCD may prevent the anticipated decline in pulmonary function over time.

34263922	Fluid overload due to intravenous fluid therapy for vaso-occlusive crisis in sickle cell disease: incidence and risk factors.	Intravenous fluid therapy (IV-FT) is routinely used in the treatment of vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs), as dehydration possibly promotes and sustains erythrocyte sickling. Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) are at risk of developing diastolic dysfunction and fluid overload due to IV-FT. However, data on the adverse effects of IV-FT for VOC is sparse. We aimed to evaluate the incidence and risk factors of fluid overload due to IV-FT in patients with SCD. Consecutive hospitalisations for VOC treated with IV-FT between September 2016 and September 2018 were retrospectively analysed. The median (interquartile range) age was 25 0 (18 3-33 8) years and 65% had a severe genotype (HbSS/HbSbeta0 -thal). Fluid overload occurred in 21% of 100 patients. Hospital stay was longer in patients with fluid overload (6 0 vs. 4 0 days, P = 0 037). A positive history of fluid overload (P = 0 017), lactate dehydrogenase level (P = 0 011), and top-up transfusion during admission (P = 0 005) were independently associated with fluid overload occurrence. IV-FT was not reduced in 86% of patients despite a previous history of fluid overload. Fluid overload is frequently encountered during IV-FT for VOC. IV-FT is often not adjusted despite a positive history of fluid overload or when top-up transfusion is indicated, emphasising the need for more awareness of this complication and a personalised approach.
32286203	Leg Ulcers in Sickle-Cell Disease: Treatment Update.	Significance: Sickle-cell leg ulcers (SCLUs) are a severe, chronic, and recurrent complication of sickle-cell disease (SCD). There are no official recommendations for treatment. Recent Advances: Only a few studies with a high level of evidence have been conducted to evaluate treatment of SCLUs. However, several studies have been conducted with a high level of evidence to evaluate the efficacy of treatments in venous leg ulcers, and SCLUs could benefit from these treatments, especially when a venous incompetence or an edema is associated. Pathophysiology of SCLUs includes a vasculopathy related to chronic hemolysis and an endothelial dysfunction, which could be therapeutic approaches to SCLU treatment. Critical Issues: Therapeutic approaches to SCLUs can target SCD on the one hand and skin healing and associated aggravating factors on the other. A review of the literature found only case series and six randomized controlled trials; some offered encouraging results, but most had serious biases. Clinical trials specifically targeting SCLUs are difficult to realize because of the small number of affected patients, in comparison with patients with leg ulcers from other causes. Future Direction: Treating SCLUs remains a challenge. Data in the literature are currently insufficient to offer clear treatment guidelines because of several biases in controlled studies. New studies are under way to assess the efficacy of topical treatments and describe the microbiome of SCLUs. Prevention of SCLU recurrence should be assessed in future clinical trials because the high risk of recurrence is an unsolved critical issue.

32202252	Haploidentical bone marrow transplant with posttransplant cyclophosphamide for sickle cell disease: An update.	Hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) can cure both children and adults with sickle cell disease. Outcomes have historically been poor for the vast majority of patients who lack a matched sibling donor. However, the development of haploidentical HCT (haplo-HCT) with high doses of posttransplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) has allowed for curative long-term potential with favorable transplant-related outcomes, though this has not obviated the potential for graft rejection from human leukocyte antigen mismatch and repeated red blood cell transfusions. Accordingly, multiple strategies have been developed to improve outcomes, the majority of which are based on the Johns Hopkins platform from 2012. Presently, we aim to discuss results from pertinent studies and compare outcomes with the two most recent approaches involving either thiotepa plus 200-cGy total body irradiation or 400-cGy total body irradiation. Direct comparisons are required to determine the optimized curative potential. Transplant-eligible patients must be referred to tertiary medical centers for consideration of haplo-HCT.
37169288	Female Reproductive Health Outcomes after Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation for Sickle Cell Disease: Is Reduced Intensity Better Than Myeloablative Conditioning?	Curative therapy for sickle cell disease (SCD) through hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is associated with a high level of risk for treatment-related gonadal dysfunction and future infertility. Both the myeloablative conditioning (MAC) and reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens used for SCD HCT are considered to carry a high risk for ovarian damage. Cyclophosphamide equivalent doses (CEDs) are thought to correlate with the degree of gonadal damage in pediatric oncology patients. We aimed to evaluate ovarian outcomes previously reported from our center, characterize the conditioning regimens as MAC or RIC, and calculate the CED for each regimen. The ovarian outcomes diminished ovarian reserve (DOR), as determined by an anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) below the normal limits for age and assay or <5%, and premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), defined as a follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level >40 mIU/ML, are presented by conditioning regimen from 3 clinical studies from our center (2 published and 1 presented as an abstract in 2022). The studies were not mutually exclusive of patients. CEDs were calculated for each regimen. The CED ranged from 3388 to 9705 mg/m2 for MAC regimens and from 5600 to 18,750 mg/m2 for RIC regimens. DOR was observed in all regimens; however, in one study 2 patients had normal AMH levels after a fludarabine/melphalan regimen, and 1 patient had a normal AMH level after a fludarabine/melphalan/thiotepa regimen. Rates of POI were more variable and ranged from 40% to 100% after MAC regimens and from 0 to 100% after RIC regimens. Female patients with SCD who undergo HCT have very high rates of DOR after both MAC HCT and RIC HCT. Two of the 3 RIC regimens evaluated had higher CEDs than were seen in any of the MAC regimens evaluated. Rates of POI were more variable but may increase with time from transplantation. All SCD patients need to be counseled about the risk of infertility and provided information about fertility preservation.
34116933	Taking therapeutic apheresis services to patients in South Africa: An eight year review of SANBS mobile therapeutic apheresis service, 2013-2020.	INTRODUCTION: A 20 year review of health and health care presents the multiple challenges faced by South Africans. Health and poverty is highlighted with 45% of population living on approximately US$ 2 per day and 10 million living on less than US$ 1 per day. Widening disparities in health care provision between public and private sector hospital services exist. The South African population includes the largest number of people living with HIV infection/AIDS of any country in the world, with a 70% estimate of 7.5 million people living with HIV on antiretroviral therapy. The South African National Blood Service provides a mixed model therapeutic apheresis service including mobile service and fixed-site therapeutic apheresis and an apheresis collection of hematopoietic stem cell (HPC-A) service. Therapeutic apheresis modalities offered by SANBS include plasmapheresis, red cell exchange, leukocyte and platelet reduction. In addition, collection of plasma, thrombocytes, mononuclear cells including CD34+ cells (HPCs) and granulocytes by apheresis for plasma and cellular therapies, and customised apheresis products for research purposes is offered. An operational database for the period 2013 to 2020 was reviewed to characterise the SANBS's mixed therapeutic apheresis service and HPC-A service from 2013 to 2020 in terms of patient numbers, patient demographics, patient procedures, therapeutic apheresis indication or diagnosis, therapeutic apheresis modality, hospital service type, and the American Society for Apheresis (ASFA) category of diagnosis. METHODS: A retrospective review of therapeutic apheresis patients referred to SANBS characterising patient numbers, patient demographics, patient procedures, therapeutic apheresis indication or diagnosis, therapeutic apheresis modality (Linz, 2017), hospital service type, and the ASFA category of diagnosis (Padmanabhan et al., 2019) for the period 01 January 2013 to 31 December 2020 was completed. Data is obtained from a SANBS operational routinely utilised to record patient procedure data. Patient procedure data is manually recorded by apheresis nurses and indexed on to the operational database, with both processes audited. The review period is a convenience sample. Storage of the database and access of the operational database is in compliance with the Protection of Personal Information Act (Government Gazette, 2013). Therapeutic apheresis modalities analysed include Plasmapheresis, Red Cell Exchange, Leukopheresis, Thrombocytapheresis, Lymphocyte collection, Granulocyte collection, Haematopoietic stem cell collection by apheresis and customised apheresis products for research purposes. Customised apheresis products for research purposes is excluded from this review. Descriptive statistics is used. RESULTS: For the review period, 2,485 unique patients with 120 unique indications as recorded by referring clinicians received 13,518 procedures involving 7 therapeutic apheresis modalities at 78 hospitals (21 public sector and 57 private sector) and at 3 SANBS blood donor centres in 7 provinces of South Africa. The age range of patients serviced is 4 months to 90 years (median = 39.5 years) (figure 1), 91% by procedure count was for patients 21 years of age or older, 62% were female, with 10,783 (79.6%) procedures performed in public sector hospitals. In all patients, the most common indications was plasmapheresis for thrombotic thromobocytopaenic purpura (52.5% of cumulative procedures), HPC-A for multiple myeloma (7.86%) and Antibody-mediated kidney transplant rejection (4.90%). Plasmapheresis was the most common therapeutic apheresis modality used (82.5% of cumulative procedures) followed by HPC-A (13.7%) and leukoreduction (3.39%). A range of indications for plasmapheresis (n = 65) and HPC-A (n = 41) were observed. Red cell exchange procedures was performed for patients with severe malaria and sickle cell disease indications. For leukoreduction indications, all patients were adults managed in public sector facilities and all were symptomatic. The most common indications were Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia, Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia and Multiple Myeloma. A pooled, total white cell count average of 457 x 109/L (range 141-689 x 109/L) prior to first procedure. Despite complex challenges for a national mixed model service, successful patient outcomes in emergent indications such as TTP (Louw et al., 2018; Swart et al., 2019) and engraftment post HPC-A in HSCT in multiple centres (Glatt, personal communication) are reported. CONCLUSION: The review confirms that apheresis medicine is increasingly used in South Africa in patients in both public and private sector, with the most common modalities being plasmapheresis, HPC-A and leukoreduction. Patients with HIV-associated TTP is the most commonly referred patient in both paediatric and adult patients and this is anticipated to continue. A growing HSCT transplant network capacity in South Africa is augmented through the mixed model mobile and fixed-site therapeutic apheresis services, including a mobile HPC-A service. The increasing number of HPC-A is a trend towards increasing numbers of patients support to HSCT for both adults and paediatric patients in private and public sector hospitals.
36219461	Influenza Vaccination Receipt in Pediatric Patients With Cancer or Sickle Cell Disease.	BACKGROUND: Influenza causes greater morbidity in children with cancer or sickle cell disease (SCD). Literature on influenza vaccination receipt for these populations is limited in low-vaccination states. Outpatient interventions improve vaccine receipt but isolated inpatient interventions remain unstudied. PROCEDURE: We reviewed influenza vaccine receipt of children with cancer or SCD treated at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta during three influenza seasons. We implemented a clinical decision support intervention during an influenza season and compared influenza vaccine receipt preintervention and postintervention among admitted children. RESULTS: The oncology cohort (N=1548, 60% to 62%) and the SCD cohort (N=2549, 61% to 65%) had similar-to-higher vaccination receipt to the United States (58% to 64%, P =0.01 to 0.79) and Georgia (51% to 56%, P <0.01). The intervention did not significantly improve vaccination receipt for admitted children with cancer (40% vs. 56%, P =0.05 to 0.88) or SCD (44% vs. 56%, P =0.01). Regression modeling also found no significant increase in vaccine receipt (hematologic malignancy: 0.8 [0.73 to 0.98], solid tumor: 0.9 [0.80 to 1.90], central nervous system tumor: 0.9 [0.71 to 1.14], SCD: 0.9 [0.85 to 0.99]). CONCLUSIONS: Children with cancer and SCD have similar-to-greater influenza vaccination receipt compared with Georgia and the United States. An inpatient intervention did not significantly improve influenza vaccine receipt in these patient cohorts. Future studies are needed to identify alternative approaches to improving vaccine receipt in these cohorts.
34268729	Biomarkers of clinical severity in treated and untreated sickle cell disease: a comparison by genotypes of a single center cohort and African Americans in the NHANES study.	Haemolysis and vaso-occlusion underlie multi-organ system complications in sickle cell disease (SCD). We assessed real-world biomarkers in University of Illinois adult SCD patients, categorised as severe (HbSS/Sbeta0 -thalassaemia; n = 342) or mild (HbSC/Sbeta+ -thalassaemia; n = 100) genotypes and stratified according to treatment. African-American controls from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were matched with each genotype category. Most measures of haemolysis, anaemia, inflammation and function of kidneys, liver and lungs differed markedly in untreated severe genotype patients compared to NHANES controls. These same biomarkers were significantly closer to the NHANES control range in untreated mild versus severe genotype patients, but they were not improved in severe genotype patients receiving treatment with hydroxycarbamide or blood transfusions, except that haemoglobin and HbF were higher with hydroxycarbamide. Systolic blood pressures did not differ among the SCD and NHANES groups, but diastolic pressures were higher in mild genotype patients. Ferritin in severe genotype patients on chronic transfusions was 50-fold higher than NHANES controls. The cross-sectional real-world biomarkers of patients on hydroxycarbamide or transfusions were not markedly improved compared to untreated patients. This may be due partly to poor compliance or more severe disease. Our findings highlight the need for more effective treatments.
35180760	Peripheral Blood Smear Detection of Asymptomatic Central Line Infection in a Patient With Sickle Cell Disease.	Sickle cell disease is a lifelong disorder which may be managed by chronic red cell transfusion including exchange transfusion. Chronic indwelling vascular catheters including ports offer convenient and reliable access for red cell exchange but confer risk of complications including infection and thrombosis. Detection of these complications is essential for preserving vascular access and relies on both clinical and laboratory observation. Here we describe a case of asymptomatic port infection detected by manual screening of a peripheral blood smear.
32078406	Prescribers' experiences of, and attitudes to, use of morphine for palliative care at a tertiary hospital in Zambia.	OBJECTIVE: To explore medical doctors' experiences of, and attitudes to, use of morphine for palliative care at a tertiary hospital in Zambia. METHODS: A qualitative, exploratory case study was undertaken. Semi-structured interviews were used to collect data from 14 medical doctors working in the fields of oncology, pediatrics, and internal medicine at a tertiary hospital in Lusaka, Zambia, regarding their experiences and attitudes to prescribing morphine for palliative care. Thematic analysis of interview transcripts was carried out to establish common themes in the data. The study was approved by BSMS and UNZA research ethics committees. RESULTS: All participants agreed that doctors were becoming more comfortable with the prescribing of morphine, although experiences were notably different for doctors working in oncology, compared to other departments. Themes of difficulty discussing end-of-life, poor recognition of pain, and fear of patient addiction, were more prominent in the responses of non-cancer doctors. Morphine use was generally restricted to cancer and sickle cell disease patients, with most non-cancer doctors stating that they rarely prescribe morphine for outpatient use. Training in pain management and the presence of a palliative care team were perceived to be facilitators to morphine prescribing. CONCLUSIONS: Although there is an increased willingness to prescribe morphine, limited knowledge of pain management, especially for nonmalignant disease, underlies many of the findings in this study. Opportunity exists for professional development in pain management to further improve the acceptance and use of opioids in palliative care, especially for out-patients.
36708005	Childhood cancer and hematological disorders negatively affect spermatogonial quantity at diagnosis: a retrospective study of a male fertility preservation cohort.	STUDY QUESTION: What is the impact of cancer or hematological disorders on germ cells in pediatric male patients? SUMMARY ANSWER: Spermatogonial quantity is reduced in testes of prepubertal boys diagnosed with cancer or severe hematological disorder compared to healthy controls and this reduction is disease and age dependent: patients with central nervous system cancer (CNS tumors) and hematological disorders, as well as boys <7 years are the most affected. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Fertility preservation in pediatric male patients is considered based on the gonadotoxicity of selected treatments. Although treatment effects on germ cells have been extensively investigated, limited data are available on the effect of the disease on the prepubertal male gonad. Of the few studies investigating the effects of cancer or hematologic disorders on testicular function and germ cell quantity in prepuberty, the results are inconsistent. However, recent studies suggested impairments before the initiation of known gonadotoxic therapy. Understanding which diseases and at what age affect the germ cell pool in pediatric patients before treatment is critical to optimize strategies and counseling for fertility preservation. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This multicenter retrospective cohort study included 101 boys aged <14 years with extra-cerebral cancer (solid tumors), CNS tumors, leukemia/lymphoma (blood cancer), or non-malignant hematological disorders, who were admitted for a fertility preservation programme between 2002 and 2018. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: In addition to clinical data, we analyzed measurements of testicular volume and performed histological staining on testicular biopsies obtained before treatment, at cryopreservation, to evaluate number of spermatogonia per tubular cross-section, tubular fertility index, and the most advanced germ cell type prior to chemo-/radiotherapy. The controls were data simulations with summary statistics from original studies reporting healthy prepubertal boys' testes characteristics. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Prepubertal patients with childhood cancer or hematological disorders were more likely to have significantly reduced spermatogonial quantity compared to healthy controls (48.5% versus 31.0% prevalence, respectively). The prevalence of patients with reduced spermatogonial quantity was highest in the CNS tumor (56.7%) and the hematological disorder (55.6%) groups, including patients with hydroxyurea pre-treated sickle cell disease (58.3%) and patients not exposed to hydroxyurea (50%). Disease also adversely impacted spermatogonial distribution and differentiation. Irrespective of disease, we observed the highest spermatogonial quantity reduction in patients <7 years of age. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: For ethical reasons, we could not collect spermatogonial quantity data in healthy prepubertal boys as controls and thus deployed statistical simulation on data from literature. Also, our results should be interpreted considering low patient numbers per (sub)group. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Cancers, especially CNS tumors, and severe hematological disorders can affect spermatogonial quantity in prepubertal boys before treatment. Consequently, these patients may have a higher risk of depleted spermatogonia following therapies, resulting in persistent infertility. Therefore, patient counseling prior to disease treatment and timing of fertility preservation should not only be based on treatment regimes, but also on diagnoses and age.

33796176	[Epidemiological and clinical profile of children with Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) at the Center for the Treatment of Epidemics and Infection Prevention (CTEIP) of the University Hospital of Donka in Conakry].	COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is genetically similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus. In pediatrics, it has a benign clinical course. Since the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic in Guinea, whose epicenter was Conakry, pediatric cases have been reported at the CTEIP in Donka. The purpose of this study was to determine their epidemiological profile. We conducted a descriptive cross-sectional study of children aged 0-16 years admitted to the CTEIP, Donka, over a period of four months. Out of 7308 patients, coming predominantly from 5 communes of Conakry and hospitalized in the CTEPI, 189 were aged between 0 and 16 years (2 .59%). The majority of patients were within the age-group 0-4-years (38.62%) with a sex-ratio (F/M) of 1.52; 62.96% were students, 70% of children lived in Conakry, 28.57% of mothers were traders and contact persons (39.68%); 37.57% of fathers were civil servants, 2.65% of children had a history of sickle cell disease and 1.59% had allergic rhinitis. Asymptomatic patients accounted for 52.38% of cases and diagnosed patients were 74.6%. Symptoms included fever, rhinorrhea, headache, cough, abdominal pain, sneezing, diarrhea, physical asthenia. The incidence of COVID-19 among children hospitalized in the CTEIP of Donka is low. Children aged 5 years and older are more affected and nearly 50% are asymptomatic. Common symptoms are fever, headache, rhinorrhea, cough, abdominal pain, sneezing, diarrhea, physical asthenia.
31831326	Can we better predict delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions and hyperhemolysis in sickle cell disease?	Delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions (DHTR) occurring in individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD) are usually indolent but may rarely progress to life-threatening hemolysis known as hyperhemolysis syndrome (HHS), which can be difficult to diagnose and manage. We evaluate a predictive model for DHTR proposed by Drs. Pirenne and Yazdanbakhsh. A scoring system and nomogram were utilized in three individuals with SCD and delayed hemolysis, with one likely having HHS. The scoring system is based on identified risk factors for developing hemolysis from patient transfusion history, while the nomogram utilizes persistence of hemoglobin A (HbA) which is not innate to SCD patients. We propose a novel method for HbA estimation to facilitate application of the nomogram. Application of the recently published predictive scoring system revealed a low risk of developing DHTR in one patient and an intermediate risk in two patients. As serial HbA values are not routinely assessed, HbA measurements were only available in one of the three patients, though use of the nomogram predicted a high likelihood of DHTR. The recently published predictive score and nomogram yielded mixed results and should be interpreted with caution when predicting the risk of developing DHTR in individuals with SCD. Management of DHTR/HHS continues to be a challenge for transfusion medicine and hematology services standardized methods to facilitate their early diagnosis and treatment are warranted to improve the safety of blood transfusions in individuals with SCD.
35240138	Comorbidities Associated with Hospitalization and Progression Among Adolescents with Symptomatic Coronavirus Disease 2019.	OBJECTIVE: To identify subgroups likely to benefit from monoclonal antibody and antiviral therapy by evaluating the relationship between comorbidities and hospitalization among US adolescents with symptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). STUDY DESIGN: We analyzed the relationship between presence of comorbidities and need for hospitalization within 28 days of COVID-19 diagnosis for adolescents aged 12-17 years listed in the Pediatric COVID-19 US registry, a multicenter retrospective cohort of US pediatric patients with COVID-19. Comorbidities assessed included obesity, chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes, immunosuppressive disease or treatment, sickle cell disease (SCD), heart disease, neurologic disease/neurodevelopmental disorders, and pulmonary disease (excluding patients with mild asthma). We used multivariable logistic regression to determine race/ethnicity-adjusted associations between comorbidities and hospitalization. RESULTS: A total of 1877 patients met our inclusion criteria, of whom 284 (15%) were hospitalized within 28 days of their COVID-19 diagnosis. In a race/ethnicity-adjusted model, the following comorbidities were independently associated with increased odds of hospitalization: SCD (aOR, 6.9; 95% CI, 3.0-15.9), immunocompromising condition (aOR, 6.4; 95% CI, 3.8-10.8), obesity (aOR, 3.2; 95% CI, 2.1-4.9), diabetes (aOR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.4-6.2), neurologic disease (aOR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.8-4.3), and pulmonary disease (excluding mild asthma) (aOR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.2-3.1). Heart disease and CKD were not independently associated with hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: SCD, immunocompromising conditions, obesity, diabetes, neurologic disease, and pulmonary disease (excluding mild asthma) were associated with hospitalization for symptomatic COVID-19. Adolescents with acute COVID-19 and these comorbidities should be prioritized for consideration of therapy to avert hospitalization.

31942751	Blood transfusions for treating acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease is an inherited autosomal recessive blood condition and is one of the most prevalent genetic blood diseases worldwide. Acute chest syndrome is a frequent complication of sickle cell disease, as well as a major cause of morbidity and the greatest single cause of mortality in children with sickle cell disease. Standard treatment may include intravenous hydration, oxygen as treatment for hypoxia, antibiotics to treat the infectious cause and blood transfusions may be given. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2010 and updated in 2016. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of blood transfusions, simple and exchange, for treating acute chest syndrome by comparing improvement in symptoms and clinical outcomes against standard care. SEARCH METHODS: We searched The Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearching of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of the most recent search: 30 May 2019. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing either simple or exchange transfusion versus standard care (no transfusion) in people with sickle cell disease suffering from acute chest syndrome. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Both authors independently selected trials and assessed the risk of bias, no data could be extracted. MAIN RESULTS: One trial was eligible for inclusion in the review. While in the multicentre trial 237 people were enrolled (169 SCC, 42 SC, 15 Sbeta0-thalassaemia, 11Sbeta+-thalassaemia); the majority were recruited to an observational arm and only ten participants met the inclusion criteria for randomisation. Of these, four were randomised to the transfusion arm and received a single transfusion of 7 to 13 mL/kg packed red blood cells, and six were randomised to standard care. None of the four participants who received packed red blood cells developed acute chest syndrome, while 33% (two participants) developed acute chest syndrome in standard care arm. No data for any pre-defined outcomes were available. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found only one very small randomised controlled trial; this is not enough to make any reliable conclusion to support the use of blood transfusion. Whilst there appears to be some indication that chronic blood transfusion may play a roll in reducing the incidence of acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease and albeit offering transfusions may be a widely accepted clinical practice, there is currently no reliable evidence to support or refute the perceived benefits of these as treatment options; very limited information about any of the potential harms associated with these interventions or indeed guidance that can be used to aid clinical decision making. Clinicians should therefore base any treatment decisions on a combination of; their clinical experience, individual circumstances and the unique characteristics and preferences of adequately informed people with sickle cell disease who are suffering with acute chest syndrome. This review highlights the need of further high quality research to provide reliable evidence for the effectiveness of these interventions for the relief of the symptoms of acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease.
38302121	Disease-Modifying Therapies for Sickle Cell Disease-An Overview.	Sickle cell disease refers to a group of inherited blood disorders in which hemoglobin polymerization leads to hemolysis and vaso-occlusion. This causes a myriad of complications during a patient's life span, ranging from anemia, infections, and acute and chronic pain to stroke and multiorgan dysfunction. Although there have been dramatic improvements in childhood survival thanks to improved supportive care with penicillin prophylaxis, immunizations, and improved transfusion practices, there was a dearth of disease-modifying therapies, with hydroxyurea being the only medication for >20 years. Here, we discuss the newer therapies for sickle cell disease that have emerged in recent years. [Pediatr Ann. 2024;53(2):e52-e55.].
32589774	Sickle cell trait and the potential risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019-A mini-review.	Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a rapidly evolving public health problem. The severity of COVID-19 cases reported hitherto has varied greatly from asymptomatic to severe pneumonia and thromboembolism with subsequent mortality. An improved understanding of risk factors for adverse clinical outcomes may shed some light on novel personalized approaches to optimize clinical care in vulnerable populations. Emerging trends in the United States suggest possibly higher mortality rates of COVID-19 among African Americans, although detailed epidemiological study data is pending. Sickle cell disease (SCD) disproportionately affects Black/African Americans in the United States as well as forebearers from sub-Saharan Africa, the Western Hemisphere (South America, the Caribbean, and Central America), and some Mediterranean countries. The carrier frequency for SCD is high among African Americans. This article underscores the putative risks that may be associated with COVID-19 pneumonia in sickle cell trait as well as potential opportunities for individualized medical care in the burgeoning era of personalized medicine.
33025340	In vitro assessment of the anti-sickling properties of Buchholzia coriacea and Mucuna pruriens seed extracts.	Sickle cell disease is a group of diseases inherited through the gene and it affects the haemoglobin in the red blood cell. This study investigated the methanol seed extract of Buchholzia coriacea for possible in vitro anti-sickling effects and also determined the effect of Mucuna pruriens seed extract on the solubility and oxygen-binding rate of sickle cell haemoglobin. Sickle cell blood was collected from sickle cell disease patients with subsequent addition of 2% sodium metabisulphite to cause more sickling. Varying concentrations of the seed extracts (50%, 25%, 12.5% and 6.25%) were added to the pre-treated blood for these in vitro assays. The results showed that the extract of Buchholzia coriacea significantly (P < 0.05) inhibited sickling at all concentrations with the highest percentage inhibition of 73.3 +- 5.8, reversed sickled erythrocytes at all concentrations with the highest percentage reversal of 83.3 +- 5.8 and significantly (P < 0.05) inhibited polymerisation at all concentrations used in comparison to the parallel control. The extract of Mucuna pruriens seed significantly (P < 0.05) increased the solubility of sickle haemoglobin at 50%, 25%, 12.5% and 6.25% concentrations, increased Fe2+/Fe3+ ratio from 1.7 (control) to 12.2 (50% concentration) and reduced osmotic fragility (at 12.5% and 6.25% concentrations) when compared with parallel control. The results indicate the feasibility of the seed extracts as promising agents in the management of sickle cell disease.
33515215	Adapting to supply-and-demand emerging trends for antigen-negative red blood cell units.	BACKGROUND: A global downtrend in blood usage has been observed by many countries, while the demand for antigen-negative red blood cell (RBC) units used in antigen-matched transfusions keeps increasing. The declining number of units collected exposes blood providers to a rapidly evolving supply challenge. METHODS: This study was conducted retrospectively with use of internal data analysis to weigh Quebec's situation regarding global and antigen-negative RBC demand, to measure the effects of community-directed recruitment and blood drives, and to evaluate the benefits of mass-scale RBC genotyping. RESULTS: Our findings confirm a global RBC usage downtrend of over 20% total in the past 10 years with a steady antigen-negative usage and highlight the most requested negative antigen combinations. Our data also show our +39.5% progress regarding the number of Black donors recruited for antigen matching of patients with sickle cell disease in the past 3 years, as well as a constantly growing number of just-in-time blood collection for complex orders. Finally, our data summarize the efficiency of our mass-scale RBC genotyping efforts. CONCLUSION: Altogether, this study confirms the demand trends for regular and antigen-negative RBC units in Quebec and the efficient effects of our recruitment and typing strategies.
31606237	Genetics and ESKD Disparities in African Americans.	African Americans have a 2- to 4-fold greater incidence of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) than whites, which has long raised the possibility of a genetic cause for this disparity. Recent advances in genetic studies have shown a causal association of polymorphisms at the apolipoprotein L1 gene (APOL1) with the markedly increased risk for the nondiabetic component of the overall disparity in ESKD in African Americans. Although APOL1-associated kidney disease is thought to account for a substantial proportion of ESKD in African Americans, not all the increased risk for ESKD is accounted for, and a complete cataloging of disparities in genetic causes of ESKD eludes our current understanding of genetic-associated kidney disease. Genetic testing aids the screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of diseases with a genetic basis. Widespread use of genetic testing in clinical practice is limited by the small number of actionable genetic variants, limited health literacy of providers and patients, and underlying complex ethical, legal, and social issues. This perspective reviews racial and ethnic differences associated with genetic diseases and the development of ESKD in African Americans and discusses potential uncertainties associated with our current understanding of penetrance of genetically linked kidney disease and population-attributable risk percent.
33541761	Parameters affecting successful stem cell collections for genetic therapies in sickle cell disease.	Emerging cellular therapies require the collection of peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) by apheresis for in vitro manipulation to accomplish gene addition or gene editing. These therapies require relatively large numbers of HSCs within a short time frame to generate an efficacious therapeutic product. This review focuses on the principal factors that affect collection outcomes, especially relevant to gene therapy for sickle cell disease.

35485039	[Self-management of pain crisis in patients with sickle cell disease].	Introduction : Sickle cell disease, while it is the most common genetic disease in France, is little known to caregivers and the general public.Context : Only a few studies have examined the daily lives of people suffering from this disease.Objectives : The purpose of this project was to describe the specific strategies helping adult patients to manage the symptoms of their disease.Method : To reach this objective, a qualitative study was conducted among eight homozygous (SS) people over 30 years old living in the Ile-de-France region of France. The semi-structured interviews took place at the patients' homes, selected from several regional competence centers and on social media. An inductive methodology and a thematic analysis were used to draw the conclusions of this research.Results : They show that pain and suffering are patients' main complaints. Patients suffering from sickle cell disease seek numerous effective self-care strategies to manage their long-term pain : preventive measures and drugs, as well as complementary and alternative medicine.Discussion : A sociological approach shows us the considerable work that patients undertake to manage symptoms daily.Conclusion : The findings support interventions that would increase the feeling of control over the disease through better self-awareness and appropriate physical activity.
31845460	National comparative audit of blood transfusion: 2014 audit of transfusion services and practice in children and adults with sickle cell disease.	OBJECTIVES: To determine the organisational resources in place; what blood was being transfused, why, how, where, when and by whom; whether laboratory support and policies met standards for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). BACKGROUND: SCD affects 14 000 people in the United Kingdom (UK). Standards and guidelines do not cover all aspects of transfusion in SCD and there are no data on their use; people may become very sick without warning presenting to non-specialist hospitals; blood services are increasingly supplying units for transfusion in SCD with little data on their use. METHODS: A retrospective audit of transfusion services/practice for people with SCD who had received a transfusion in January-July 2014 in participating hospitals in the UK and Republic of Ireland (ROI). RESULTS: Eighty-four hospitals submitted 1290 cases, 75% of cases came from 18 hospitals submitting 25 or more cases. Transfusions (91.2% [1164/1276]) were administered to patients with HbSS, 60% (732/1227) of patients needed Rh CE negative blood. Transfusion episodes (4528) were recorded, of which 84% were elective. Stroke prevention accounted for 42% of all transfusions; adults received 56% of transfusions of which 50% were automated red cell exchange (RCE), children received 44% of transfusions of which 87% were simple transfusions. CONCLUSIONS: There was a paucity of appropriate clinical management protocols, adequately trained staff and network arrangements. The high numbers of children being transfused, disparity in transfusion modality between children and adults and the high frequency of the CE negative Rh phenotype were noted.
34417053	Influenza immunization coverage of children with sickle cell disease.	OBJECTIVES: To assess receipt of annual flu immunization among children living with sickle cell disease (SCD). METHODS: Receipt of flu immunization (2014-2019) by SCD status was assessed among all Michigan children <18 years of age using the statewide immunization registry. Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds of annual flu immunization by SCD status and age. RESULTS: Annual flu immunization coverage was higher among children with SCD (46.9%; n = 751) than without (23.2%; n = 2,012,846). The annual adjusted odds of flu immunization for those with SCD were 2.8 (95% CI: 2.5-3.1) times higher than for those without SCD; there were no significant differences by age among children with SCD. Among those without SCD, adolescents aged 13-17 were 2.2 (95% CI: 2.2-2.2) times less likely to receive annual flu immunization than children 6-35 months. CONCLUSIONS: Children with SCD had higher annual flu immunization rates than those without SCD, but >50% remain unimmunized.
32621537	Cumulative outcome of pre-implantation genetic diagnosis for sickle cell disease: a 5-year review.	To review the cumulative outcome of pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) cycles performed for prevention of sickle cell disease (SCD). Couples referred for PGD for SCD between April 2012 and October 2017 were included. Ovarian stimulation was performed using a short gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist protocol and follicle-stimulating hormone injections. The GnRH agonist was used to trigger oocyte maturation. Oocytes were fertilised using intracytoplasmic sperm injection. Trophectoderm biopsy was performed on day 5 or 6 followed by vitrification. Genetic testing was done using pre-implantation genetic haplotyping. A total of 60 couples started 70 fresh PGD cycles (mean 1 2 cycles/couple) and underwent a total of 74 frozen-embryo-transfer (FET) cycles (mean 1 3 FET/couple). The mean (SD) female age was 33 (4 4) years and the mean (SD) anti-mullerian hormone level was 22 9 (2 8) pmol/l. The cumulative live-birth rate was 54%/PGD cycle started and 63%/couple embarking on PGD. The rate of multiple births was 8%. The cumulative outcome of PGD treatment for prevention of SCD transmission is high and PGD treatment should be offered to all at-risk couples.

32472448	Literacy assessment of preimplantation genetic patient education materials exceed national reading levels.	PURPOSE: In vitro fertilization with preimplantation genetic testing (IVF+PGT-M) reduces the risk of having a child affected by a heritable condition, yet only one-third of eligible patients are aware of this reproductive option. Access to education materials written at appropriate literacy levels could raise patients' awareness, but there is a mismatch between patient reading ability and the literacy demand of most materials. This study aimed to systematically identify written education materials on IVF+PGT-M and evaluate their literacy levels. We hypothesized that materials would fail to meet standards set by the Joint Commission and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). METHODS: To identify patient education materials about IVF+PGT-M from academic databases and public-facing sources, an environmental scan was performed. Materials were analyzed using three validated scales: Simple Measure of Gobbledygook, Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool, and Clear Communication Index. RESULTS: Seventeen patient education materials about IVF+PGT-M were identified from patient education databases, a consumer search engine, and professional organizations. The median reading level was 14.5 grade, median understandability was 74.2%, and median comprehensibility was 73.3%. CONCLUSIONS: For most American adults, materials about IVF+PGT-M are not readable, understandable, or clear. The Joint Commission requires patient education materials be written at or below 5th grade reading level and the CDC recommends a 90% minimum score for comprehensibility. No evaluated material met these guidelines. Patient education materials that exceed average American literacy skills may perpetuate disparities in the utilization of IVF+PGT-M. Materials that communicate this complicated subject at an understandable level are needed.
32573838	COVID-19 and thalassaemia: A position statement of the Thalassaemia International Federation.	OBJECTIVES: Many patients with haemoglobinopathies, including thalassaemia and sickle cell disease, are at increased risk of developing severe complications from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Although epidemiologic evidence concerning the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection in these patients is currently lacking, the COVID-19 pandemic represents a significant challenge for haemoglobinopathy patients, their families and their attending physicians. METHODS: The present statement summarizes the key challenges concerning the management of haemoglobinopathies, with particular focus on patients with either transfusion-dependent or non-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia, identifies the gaps in knowledge and suggests measures and strategies to deal with the pandemic, based on available evidence and expert opinions. Key areas covered include patients' risk level, adaptation of haemoglobinopathy care, safety of blood transfusions, blood supply challenges, and lifestyle and nutritional considerations. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed measures and strategies may be useful as a blueprint for other disorders which require regular hospital visits, as well as for the timely adaptation of patient care during similar future pandemics.
33534948	Non-myeloablative human leukocyte antigen-matched related donor transplantation in sickle cell disease: outcomes from three independent centres.	Non-myeloablative haematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation (HPCT) from matched related donors (MRD) has been increasingly utilized in sickle cell disease (SCD). A total of 122 patients received 300 cGy of total body irradiation (TBI), alemtuzumab, unmanipulated filgrastim-mobilized peripheral blood HPC and sirolimus. The median follow-up was four years; median age at HPCT was 29 years. Median neutrophil and platelet engraftment occurred on day 22 and 19 respectively; 41 patients required no platelet transfusions. Overall and sickle-free survival at one and five years were 93% and 85% respectively. Age, sex, pre-HPCT sickle complications, ferritin and infused HPC numbers were similar between graft failure and engrafted patients. Mean donor myeloid chimaerism at one and five years post HPCT were 84% and 88%, and CD3 was 48% and 53% respectively. Two patients developed grade 1 and 2 skin graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) with no chronic GVHD. Median days of recipients taking immunosuppression were 489; 83% of engrafted patients have discontinued immunosuppression. Haemoglobin, haemolytic parameters and hepatic iron levels improved post HPCT. Pulmonary function testing, hepatic histology and neurovascular imaging remained stable, suggesting cessation of further sickle-related injury. Fourteen patients had children. In this largest group of adult SCD patients, this regimen was highly efficacious, well-tolerated despite compromised organ functions pre HPCT, and without clinically significant GVHD.
32147066	Review/overview of pain in sickle cell disease.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a highly complex inherited disorder of hemoglobin structure. Although the molecular lesion is a single-point mutation, the sickle gene is pleiotropic in nature causing multiple phenotypic expressions that constitute the various complications of the disease. Its manifestations could be acute, chronic, nociceptive, neuropathic that could occur singly or in various combinations. Pain continues to be the major factor of SCD phenotypic complications and the most common cause of admissions to the Emergency Department and/or the hospital. Although progress has been made in understanding the pathophysiology of SCD as well as in developing curative therapies such as hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and gene therapy, effective pain management continues to lag behind. Palliative therapies continue to be the major approach to the management of SCD and its complications. The advent of hydroxyurea made partial success in preventing the frequency of vaso-occlusive crises and l-glutamine awaits post-trial confirmation of benefits. The search for additional pharmacotherapeutic agents that could be used singly or in combination with hydroxyurea and/or l-glutamine awaits their dawn hopefully in the near future. The purpose of this review is to describe the various manifestations of SCD, their pathophysiology and their current management. Recent impressive advances in understanding the pathophysiology of pain promise the determination of agents that could replace or minimize the use of opioids.
32818300	Primary prevention of sickle cell disease using preimplantation genetic testing and in vitro fertilization is cost-effective.

38786070	Current and Future Therapeutics for Treating Patients with Sickle Cell Disease.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common genetic blood disorder in the United States, with over 100,000 people suffering from this debilitating disease. SCD is caused by abnormal hemoglobin (Hb) variants that interfere with normal red blood cell (RBC) function. Research on SCD has led to the development and approval of several new SCD therapies in recent years. The recent FDA-approved novel gene therapies are potentially curative, giving patients an additional option besides a hematopoietic bone marrow transplant. Despite the promise of existing therapies, questions remain regarding their long-term pharmacological effects on adults and children. These questions, along with the exorbitant cost of the new gene therapies, justify additional research into more effective therapeutic options. Continual research in this field focuses on not only developing cheaper, more effective cures/treatments but also investigating the physiological effects of the current therapies on SCD patients, particularly on the brain and kidneys. In this article, we undertake a comprehensive review of ongoing clinical trials with completion dates in 2024 or later. Our exploration provides insights into the landscape of current therapeutics and emerging novel therapies designed to combat and potentially eradicate SCD, including the latest FDA-approved gene therapies.
34628962	Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant for Sickle Cell Disease: PATIENT SELEction and Timing Based on Sickle Cell-Related Multiple Chronic Conditions.	Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is the only cure for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Although most SCD patients experience progressive end-organ damage and shortened lifespans, not all patients follow the same disease course, tempo, or outcome. Therefore, the dilemma facing physicians is weighing the selection of patients and timing for the procedure against donor type and transplant-related mortality and morbidity that go up with increasing age. On the other hand, the dilemma facing the patients and families is how acceptable HSCT that carries some mortality risks to them. We have analyzed the chronic conditions due to SCD in 449 patients to determine whether SCD-related multiple chronic conditions (MCC) can be risk-stratified to identify the group of patients predicted to not only have shortened lifespans but also functional limitation and poor quality of life so that these at-risk patients can be offered HSCT early and before MCC develops. We identified that the age of onset of the first SCD-related chronic conditions strongly predicted for the risks for disease-related MCC. SCD patients who suffered their first disease-related chronic condition before age 30 years developed MCC at a rate of 19.1 times faster than those at a later age. These patients are therefore high-risk patients and should be offered HSCT early in the course of their disease before multiple organ damage intervenes, even if matched-related donors are not available. This patient selection and timing approach provides a forum for an easy-to-understand and real-time discussion, including the choice of donor type, with SCD patients and families when considering HSCT.
36866433	Case report: Successful treatment with plasma exchange in life-threatening hyperhemolytic syndrome unrelated to sickle cell disease.	INTRODUCTION: Hyperhemolytic syndrome (HHS) is a severe form of delayed transfusion reaction primarily described in sickle cell anemia patients which is characterized by a hemoglobin decrease to pre-transfusion levels or lower, often with reticulocytopenia and no evidence of auto- or allo-antibodies. CASE PRESENTATION: We present two cases of severe HHS in patients without sickle cell anemia refractory to treatment with steroids, immunoglobulins, and rituximab. In one case, temporary relief was achieved with eculizumab. In both cases, plasma exchange resulted in a profound and immediate response allowing for splenectomy and resolution of hemolysis. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: We discuss the pathophysiology of HHS, its presentation and treatment and expand on the possible role of plasma exchange in this setting.
34550643	How I approach disease-modifying therapy in children with sickle cell disease in an era of novel therapies.	Finally,after decades of stagnation, the therapeutic landscape for sickle cell disease (SCD) is changing with an increasing number of novel therapeutics. Hydroxyurea remains the primary disease-modifying therapy and, when started early in life with maintenance of an optimal dose, can reduce many SCD-related complications. To complement hydroxyurea, there are a growing number of pharmacologic options with additional efforts focused on the development and optimization of curative therapies. Here, we review current treatment options and provide recommendations as to how to approach the treatment of children and adolescents within this evolving therapeutic landscape to allow for full and healthy lives.
33974583	Maintenance of a High Influenza Vaccination Rate and Improvement in Health Outcomes in a Pediatric Sickle Cell Disease Clinic.	BACKGROUND: Children with sickle cell disease (SCD) are at high-risk of complications from influenza and should receive an influenza vaccination seasonally. Despite this recommendation, vaccination rates remain suboptimal. Boston Medical Center (BMC) previously achieved high influenza vaccination rates among its pediatric patients with SCD. The purpose of this study was to determine whether this high vaccination rate has been maintained and whether it has influenced outcome measures. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted in the hematology clinic at an urban, academic medical center. Fisher's exact test and the independent samples t test were used to determine if there were any significant differences in characteristics between patients with influenza and patients without influenza, as well as between vaccinated and unvaccinated patients. Influenza vaccination rate, influenza-related hospitalization rate, and influenza-positive rate were collected and compared with reported rates. RESULTS: Data from 124 pediatric patients with SCD were examined. The influenza vaccination rate for pediatric patients with SCD at BMC (90.32%) was higher than previous studies that were not conducted at BMC, while BMC's influenza-related hospitalization rate (0) and influenza-positive rate (4.84%) were lower than other studies. Subjects who contracted influenza were younger than those who did not (4.67 vs. 10.03 y, P=0.005). CONCLUSIONS: BMC has maintained a high influenza vaccination rate among pediatric patients with SCD. BMC's vaccination strategy has been successful at improving outcome measures including rates of influenza and influenza hospitalizations without requiring additional staff. Such efforts should be replicated at other centers.
32202244	Status quo of allogeneic stem cell transplantation for patients with sickle cell disease using matched unrelated donors.	This mini review is based on an oral presentation reflecting the current status quo of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) using matched unrelated donors (MUDs) presented at the EBMT Sickle Disease Meeting held in Regensburg, Germany, in May 2019. Although the clinical trial landscape for MUD HSCT in patients with SCD is limited to date, some attempts to improve patient outcome in terms of overall survival and event-free survival have been made recently, including optimization of conditioning regimens and prevention of engraftment failure as well as graft-versus-host disease. The results achieved by these approaches are summarized in this review and are still unsatisfactory. Whether new haploidentical transplantation protocols will achieve superior results and are able to replace MUD HSCT for patients with SCD remains to be elucidated.
36482771	RNA in Therapeutics: CRISPR in the Clinic.	The advent of the CRISPR-Cas genome editing platform has greatly enhanced the capabilities of researchers in many areas of biology. Its use has also been turned to the development of therapies for genetic diseases and to the enhancement of cell therapies. This review describes some recent advances in these areas.
35405207	Black and White Adults With CKD Hospitalized With Acute Kidney Injury: Findings From the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study.	RATIONALE & OBJECTIVE: Few studies have investigated racial disparities in acute kidney injury (AKI), in contrast to the extensive literature on racial differences in the risk of kidney failure. We sought to study potential differences in risk in the setting of chronic kidney disease (CKD). STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: We studied 2,720 self-identified Black or White participants with CKD enrolled in the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study from July 1, 2013, to December 31, 2017. EXPOSURE: Self-reported race (Black vs White). OUTCOME: Hospitalized AKI (>=50% increase from nadir to peak serum creatinine). ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Cox regression models adjusting for demographics (age and sex), prehospitalization clinical risk factors (diabetes, blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, estimated glomerular filtration rate, proteinuria, receipt of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers), and socioeconomic status (insurance status and education level). In a subset of participants with genotype data, we adjusted for apolipoprotein L1 gene (APOL1) high-risk status and sickle cell trait. RESULTS: Black participants (n = 1,266) were younger but had a higher burden of prehospitalization clinical risk factors. The incidence rate of first AKI hospitalization among Black participants was 6.3 (95% CI, 5.5-7.2) per 100 person-years versus 5.3 (95% CI, 4.6-6.1) per 100 person-years among White participants. In an unadjusted Cox regression model, Black participants were at a modestly increased risk of incident AKI (HR, 1.22 [95% CI, 1.01-1.48]) compared with White participants. However, this risk was attenuated and no longer significant after adjusting for prehospitalization clinical risk factors (adjusted HR, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.83-1.25]). There were only 11 AKI hospitalizations among individuals with high-risk APOL1 risk status and 14 AKI hospitalizations among individuals with sickle cell trait. LIMITATIONS: Participants were limited to research volunteers and potentially not fully representative of all CKD patients. CONCLUSIONS: In this multicenter prospective cohort of CKD patients, racial disparities in AKI incidence were modest and were explained by differences in prehospitalization clinical risk factors.

32889040	"Pain is Subjective": A Mixed-Methods Study of Provider Attitudes and Practices Regarding Pain Management in Sickle Cell Disease Across Three Countries.	CONTEXT: Sickle cell disease (SCD), an autosomal recessive blood disorder, affects millions of people worldwide. Approximately 80% of all cases are located in Africa. OBJECTIVES: This cross-national, interdisciplinary, collaborative study investigated provider attitudes about, and practices for, managing (assessing and treating) SCD pain. METHODS: We conducted 111 quantitative surveys and 52 semistructured interviews with health-care providers caring for adults and/or children with SCD in Cameroon, Jamaica, and the U.S. RESULTS: Applying Haywood's scale for assessing SCD provider attitudes, the Jamaica site scored lower on "Negative Attitudes" than the Cameroonian and U.S. sites (P = 0.03 and <0.001, respectively). Providers at the U.S. site scored lower on "Positive Attitudes" than other sites (P < 0.001). "Red Flag" scores at the Cameroon sites were lower than at other sites (P < 0.001). Qualitative results across all three sites describe the current practices for SCD pain management, as well as the challenges surrounding management for health providers, including pain subjectivity, patient-provider and parent-provider relationships, resource availability, perceptions of drug-seeking behavior, and adherence. Providers also spontaneously offered solutions to reported challenges. CONCLUSION: Overall, findings reveal that SCD provider attitudes toward their patients differed across sites, yet at all three sites, treating SCD pain is multidimensional.
37051746	Parental perspective on the risk of infertility and fertility preservation options for children and adolescents with sickle cell disease considering hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.	BACKGROUND: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) performed in children from human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical related donors is associated with very high survival rates and disease-free survival. Patients are exposed to gonadotoxic alkylating agents or irradiation in the HCT conditioning regimen. Consequently, infertility is a major long-term complication of HCT for sickle cell disease (SCD). We sought to understand how caregivers perceive the risk of infertility from HCT, how they perceive the options for fertility preservation, and how this risk perception impacted their decision-making to pursue HCT. PROCEDURES: We conducted qualitative interviews with primary caregivers after a consultation for HCT for SCD. Data were analyzed using descriptive qualitative analysis. RESULTS: We interviewed 19 primary caregivers who had attended a consultation with an HCT physician (female, age 25-59 [median 39] years). Eleven participants reported that their child had an available HLA-matched donor. Analysis revealed that (i) mothers were worried about death and graft-versus-host disease from HCT, more than about the risk of infertility; (ii) parents have a realistic understanding of the risk of infertility after HCT and take it into consideration in decision-making; (iii) parents report multiple barriers to fertility preservation. CONCLUSION: For parents actively considering HCT for their child with SCD, the risk of infertility while important was not a barrier to pursuing HCT. Inconvenience and invasiveness of fertility preservation procedures are some of the barriers to pursuing fertility preservation for their child. Future research must aim at addressing these barriers to fertility preservation.
34079130	Base editing of haematopoietic stem cells rescues sickle cell disease in mice.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is caused by a mutation in the beta-globin gene HBB1. We used a custom adenine base editor (ABE8e-NRCH)2,3 to convert the SCD allele (HBBS) into Makassar beta-globin (HBBG), a non-pathogenic variant4,5. Ex vivo delivery of mRNA encoding the base editor with a targeting guide RNA into haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) from patients with SCD resulted in 80% conversion of HBBS to HBBG. Sixteen weeks after transplantation of edited human HSPCs into immunodeficient mice, the frequency of HBBG was 68% and hypoxia-induced sickling of bone marrow reticulocytes had decreased fivefold, indicating durable gene editing. To assess the physiological effects of HBBS base editing, we delivered ABE8e-NRCH and guide RNA into HSPCs from a humanized SCD mouse6 and then transplanted these cells into irradiated mice. After sixteen weeks, Makassar beta-globin represented 79% of beta-globin protein in blood, and hypoxia-induced sickling was reduced threefold. Mice that received base-edited HSPCs showed near-normal haematological parameters and reduced splenic pathology compared to mice that received unedited cells. Secondary transplantation of edited bone marrow confirmed that the gene editing was durable in long-term haematopoietic stem cells and showed that HBBS-to-HBBG editing of 20% or more is sufficient for phenotypic rescue. Base editing of human HSPCs avoided the p53 activation and larger deletions that have been observed following Cas9 nuclease treatment. These findings point towards a one-time autologous treatment for SCD that eliminates pathogenic HBBS, generates benign HBBG, and minimizes the undesired consequences of double-strand DNA breaks.
34889371	Evidence-Based Minireview: In young children with severe sickle cell disease, do the benefits of HLA-identical sibling donor HCT outweigh the risks?	In case 1, a 14-month-old male child with sickle cell disease (SCD) was referred for evaluation for an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT). The patient had a history of dactylitis 3 times in his first year of life and febrile episodes twice at the consult. His 4-year-old sister was found to be human leukocyte antigen (HLA) identical. The patient was started on hydroxyurea (HU) at 2.5 years of age. His parents again sought consultation when he was 5 years old because of concerns about his medical condition. At the time, the patient had experienced 2 vaso-occlusive pain episodes (VOEs) requiring hospitalization during the previous 2 years. He had also experienced intermittent pain crises requiring rest at home for 2 to 3 days. The child has not attended school in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The family is considering HCT but is ambivalent about it because of potential toxicity. In case 2, an 8-year-old female child is 3 years out from HCT for SCD from her HLA-identical sibling. Before HCT, despite receiving HU, she had experienced >5 VOEs requiring hospitalization and 2 episodes of acute chest syndromes in the previous 3 years. She had also been missing almost 50 days of school days each year. After HCT, she is now attending school regularly and participating in all normal age-appropriate activities. The parents believe that HCT has been transformative in their child's life.
32797735	Role of prophylactic and therapeutic red blood cell exchange in pregnancy with sickle cell disease: Maternal and perinatal outcomes.	BACKGROUND AND AIM: The incidence of fetomaternal complications during pregnancy is high for women with sickle cell disease (SCD), which is the most common hematologic genetic disorder worldwide. Prophylactic red blood cell exchange (pRBCX) has been shown to be efficient, safe, and feasible for preventing complications. The aim of this study was to observe maternal, perinatal, and neonatal outcomes of pregnancies in which pRBCX was. METHOD: This was a single-center, retrospective, cross-sectional study, which recruited 46 consecutive adult pregnant women with SCD between January 2012 and June 2019. Obstetric features, SCD-related complications, and fetomaternal outcomes were compared between the 27 patients who received prophylactic exchange and the 19 who did not (therapeutic exchange was performed in 7 and was not performed in 12 cases). RESULTS: Painful crises, preeclampsia, and preterm birth rates were significantly higher in the group that did not receive prophylactic exchange (control group; P = .001, P = .024, and P = .027, respectively). There was one maternal mortality in the control group (P = .41). Incidence of adverse fetal or maternal complications was significantly higher in the control group (P = .044 and P = .007, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our center's experience over a 7.5-year period, as described above, demonstrates that pRBCX in SCD affects the course of pregnancy positively by ameliorating negative fetomaternal outcomes.
37736806	CRISPR-Cas9 system: a novel and promising era of genotherapy for beta-hemoglobinopathies, hematological malignancy, and hemophilia.	Gene therapy represents a significant potential to revolutionize the field of hematology with applications in correcting genetic mutations, generating cell lines and animal models, and improving the feasibility and efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. Compared to different genetic engineering tools, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) emerged as an effective and versatile genetic editor with the ability to precisely modify the genome. The applications of genetic engineering in various hematological disorders have shown encouraging results. Monogenic hematological disorders can conceivably be corrected with single gene modification. Through the use of CRISPR-CAS9, restoration of functional red blood cells and hemostasis factors were successfully attained in sickle cell anemia, beta-thalassemia, and hemophilia disorders. Our understanding of hemato-oncology has been advanced via CRIPSR-CAS9 technology. CRISPR-CAS9 aided to build a platform of mutated genes responsible for cell survival and proliferation in leukemia. Therapeutic application of CRISPR-CAS9 when combined with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy in multiple myeloma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia was feasible with attenuation of CAR T cell therapy pitfalls. Our review outlines the latest literature on the utilization of CRISPR-Cas9 in the treatment of beta-hemoglobinopathies and hemophilia disorders. We present the strategies that were employed and the findings of preclinical and clinical trials. Also, the review will discuss gene engineering in the field of hemato-oncology as a proper tool to facilitate and overcome the drawbacks of chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy (CAR-T).
35260961	Pragmatic Clinical Trial to Improve Patient Experience Among Adults During Transitions from Hospital to Home: the PArTNER study.	INTRODUCTION: Minority-serving hospitals (MSHs) need evidence-based strategies tailored to the populations they serve to improve patient-centered outcomes after hospitalization. METHODS: We conducted a pragmatic randomized clinical trial (RCT) from October 2014 to January 2017 at a MSH comparing the effectiveness of a stakeholder-supported Navigator intervention vs. Usual care on post-hospital patient experience, outcomes, and healthcare utilization. Community health workers and peer coaches delivered the intervention which included (1) in-hospital visits to assess barriers to health/healthcare and to develop a personalized Discharge Patient Education Tool (DPET); (2) a home visit to review the DPET; and (3) telephone-based peer coaching. The co-primary outcomes were between-group comparisons of 30-day changes in Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) measures of anxiety and informational support (minimum important difference is 2 to 5 units change); a p-value <0.025 was considered significant using intention-to-treat analysis. Secondary outcomes included death, ED visits, or readmissions and measures of emotional, social, and physical health at 30 and 60 days. RESULTS: We enrolled 1029 adults hospitalized with heart failure (28%), pneumonia (22%), MI (10%), COPD (11%), or sickle cell disease (29%). Over 80% were non-Hispanic Black. Overall, there were no significant between-group differences in the 30-day change in anxiety (adjusted difference: -1.6, 97.5% CI -3.3 to 0.1, p=0.03), informational support (adjusted difference: -0.01, 97.5% CI -2.0 to 1.9, p=0.99), or any secondary outcomes. Exploratory analyses suggested the Navigator intervention improved anxiety among participants with COPD, a primary care provider, a hospitalization in the past 12 months, or higher baseline anxiety; among participants without health insurance, the intervention improved informational support (all p-values <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In this pragmatic RCT at a MSH, the Navigator intervention did not improve post-hospital anxiety, informational support, or other outcomes compared to Usual care. Benefits observed in participant subgroups should be confirmed in future studies. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT02114515.
38517142	Disparities in pediatric hospital use during transition to adult healthcare for young adults with childhood-onset chronic conditions.	BACKGROUND: Young adults (YA) with childhood-onset chronic conditions-particularly YA with cystic fibrosis (CF), congenital heart disease (CHD), and sickle cell disease (SCD)-continue to have pediatric hospital admissions. Factors associated with this continued pediatric hospital use remain underexplored. OBJECTIVE: To determine if pediatric hospital use by YA differed (1) across condition and (2) within each condition by sociodemographic factors. METHODS: Conducted a cross-sectional analysis of admissions for YA 22-35 years with CF, CHD, and SCD from 2016 to 2020 in the National Inpatient Sample. Admissions for YA with CF, CHD, and SCD were identified by international classification of diseases, 10th revision-clinical modification diagnosis codes. To determine if conditions or sociodemographic factors were associated with YA pediatric hospital use, we used multivariable logistic regression with separate models for the different objectives. RESULTS: YA with SCD had lower odds of pediatric hospital use compared to YA with CF. Relationships between sociodemographic factors and pediatric hospital use varied. Black YA with both CF and CHD had lower odds of pediatric hospital use than white YA with CF and CHD. For YA with SCD, despite 17,810 (6.5%) having rural residence, zero (0) had pediatric hospital use; whereas YA with CF living in a rural area had greater odds of pediatric hospital use compared to urban residents. CONCLUSION: YA with SCD used pediatric hospitals less than YA with either CF or CHD. Coupled with our findings that Black YA with CF and CHD had less pediatric hospital use, these data may reflect systematic racial differences within pediatric to adult healthcare transition programs.
32428732	CTLA4Ig in an Extended Schedule along with Sirolimus Improves Outcome with a Distinct Pattern of Immune Reconstitution Following Post-Transplantation Cyclophosphamide-Based Haploidentical Transplantation for Hemoglobinopathies.	The major hindrances to the success of a haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation for hemoglobinopathies are graft failure, early post-transplant hemophagocytic syndrome (PTHPS), and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Following the successful incorporation of CTLA4Ig (abatacept) in post-transplantation cyclophosphamide-based haploidentical transplantation, we piloted this approach in 10 patients (aged 3 to 19 years), with thalassemia major (TM, n=5) and sickle cell disease (n = 5). Pretransplant immunosuppressive therapy (pTIST) was administered for 10 weeks. Conditioning was myeloablative. CTLA4Ig was administered every 2 weeks during pTIST and on days -1, +5, +20, and +35 and every 4 weeks thereafter for 6 months, along with sirolimus. A short course of low-dose dexamethasone was given from day +6 for 14 days. Nine patients engrafted at a median of 15 days, with 1 patient with TM dying of sepsis on day +19. None of the patients developed acute or chronic GVHD. All 9 patients are alive and disease free at a median follow-up of 28 months. Only 4 patients had cytomegalovirus reactivation. The pattern of immune reconstitution showed a prompt and sustained recovery of T cell subsets with memory phenotype, along with early and sustained increase of Tregs and NKG2C+ natural killer (NK) cells. This novel approach, targeting CD80 and CD86 on monocytes/macrophages, promoted engraftment and limited early-onset PTHPS and graft failure. The lack of GVHD and serious infections with this approach reflects an early recovery of Tregs, memory T cells, and persistence of NKG2C+ NK cells.
34200975	Cell and Gene Therapy for Anemia: Hematopoietic Stem Cells and Gene Editing.	Hereditary anemia has various manifestations, such as sickle cell disease (SCD), Fanconi anemia, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PDD), and thalassemia. The available management strategies for these disorders are still unsatisfactory and do not eliminate the main causes. As genetic aberrations are the main causes of all forms of hereditary anemia, the optimal approach involves repairing the defective gene, possibly through the transplantation of normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from a normal matching donor or through gene therapy approaches (either in vivo or ex vivo) to correct the patient's HSCs. To clearly illustrate the importance of cell and gene therapy in hereditary anemia, this paper provides a review of the genetic aberration, epidemiology, clinical features, current management, and cell and gene therapy endeavors related to SCD, thalassemia, Fanconi anemia, and G6PDD. Moreover, we expound the future research direction of HSC derivation from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), strategies to edit HSCs, gene therapy risk mitigation, and their clinical perspectives. In conclusion, gene-corrected hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has promising outcomes for SCD, Fanconi anemia, and thalassemia, and it may overcome the limitation of the source of allogenic bone marrow transplantation.
37671902	Acute chest syndrome in children with sickle cell disease: Data from a national AIEOP cohort identify priority areas of intervention in a hub-and-spoke system.	Acute chest syndrome (ACS) is a frequent cause of hospitalization in sickle cell disease (SCD). Despite advances in acute care, many settings still lack knowledge about ACS best practices. After the AIEOP Guidelines were published in 2012, suggesting standardized management in Italy, a retrospective study was performed to assess the diagnostic and therapeutic pathways of ACS in children. From 2013 to 2018, 208 ACS episodes were presented by 122/583 kids in 11 centres. 73 were male, mean age 10.9 years, 85% African, 92% HbSS or Sbeta . In our hub-and-spoke system, a good adherence to Guidelines was documented, but discrepancies between reference centres and general hospitals were noted. Improvement is needed for timely transfer to reference centres, use of incentive spirometry, oxygen therapy and pain management.
33020528	Non-hematopoietic deficiency of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 deficiency leads to more severe anemia in a murine model of sickle cell disease.	Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) deficiency leads to lower cholesterol and is associated with reduced vascular complications in the general population. Cholesterol lowering may also have beneficial effects in sickle cell disease (SCD). The objective of this study was to determine effects of PCSK9 deficiency in a mouse model of SCD. Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) was performed from donor SCD mice to wild-type, PCSK9-deficient, and LDLR-deficient recipients to generate SCD controls (Pcsk9+/+, SCDbmt) with preserved PCSK9 status, SCD mice with deficiency of PCSK9 (Pcsk9-/-, SCDbmt), and SCD mice with deficiency of LDLR (Ldlr-/-, SCDbmt). Although cholesterol levels were lower in Pcsk9-/-, SCDbmt mice compared to Pcsk9+/+, SCDbmt mice, anemia was more severe in Pcsk9-/-, SCDbmt mice. Increased reticulocytosis, enhanced ex vivo erythrocyte sickling, and increased erythrocyte phosphatidylserine exposure was also observed. Livers, spleens, and kidneys contained increased iron in Pcsk9-/-, SCDbmt mice compared to Pcsk9+/+, SCDbmt mice consistent with greater hemolysis. SCD mice with deficiency of LDLR (Ldlr-/-, SCDbmt mice) had similar anemia as Ldlr+/+, SCDbmt mice despite higher serum cholesterol. In conclusion, deficiency of PCSK9 is associated with worsened anemia in SCD mice due to increased hemolysis. These findings may have implications for lipid-lowering strategies in patients with SCD, as well as for potential novel modifiers of anemia severity.
32203584	Regulatory T cells promote alloengraftment in a model of late-gestation in utero hematopoietic cell transplantation.	In utero hematopoietic cell transplantation (IUHCT) has the potential to cure congenital hematologic disorders including sickle cell disease. However, the window of opportunity for IUHCT closes with the acquisition of T-cell immunity, beginning at approximately 14 weeks gestation, posing significant technical challenges and excluding from treatment fetuses evaluated after the first trimester. Here we report that regulatory T cells can promote alloengraftment and preserve allograft tolerance after the acquisition of T-cell immunity in a mouse model of late-gestation IUHCT. We show that allografts enriched with regulatory T cells harvested from either IUHCT-tolerant or naive mice engraft at 20 days post coitum (DPC) with equal frequency to unenriched allografts transplanted at 14 DPC. Long-term, multilineage donor cell chimerism was achieved in the absence of graft-versus-host disease or mortality. Decreased alloreactivity among recipient T cells was observed consistent with donor-specific tolerance. These findings suggest that donor graft enrichment with regulatory T cells could be used to successfully perform IUHCT later in gestation.
34705847	Profile of Medicaid enrollees with sickle cell disease: A high need, high cost population.	Sickle cell disease is a progressively debilitating genetic condition that affects red blood cells and can result in a variety of serious medical complications, reduced life expectancy, and diminished quality of life. Medicaid nationwide covered 66 percent of sickle cell disease hospitalizations in 2004 and 58 percent of emergency department visits for the disease between 1999 and 2007. Using Medicaid data from four states with large populations that account for more than one-third of Medicaid program enrollment, we examined the characteristics of those with sickle cell disease. We found instances of mortality rates more than nine times the age-adjusted population average (in Texas, a mortality rate for Medicaid enrollees with SCD of 1.11 percent compared to 0.12 percent overall); rates of disability-related eligibility-which is associated with long-term Medicaid enrollment-of up to 69 percent; and half or more of affected enrollees having (all-cause) hospital stays, emergency department visits, and opioid prescription fills. With gene therapies on the horizon that will spur discussions of treatment coverage, costs, and outcomes for people with sickle cell disease, it is important for relevant stakeholders to understand the affected populations.
37072548	Advances in the Diagnosis and Treatment of Pediatric Arterial Ischemic Stroke.	Though rare, stroke in infants and children is an important cause of mortality and chronic morbidity in the pediatric population. Neuroimaging advances and implementation of pediatric stroke care protocols have led to the ability to rapidly diagnose stroke and in many cases determine the stroke etiology. Though data on efficacy of hyperacute therapies, such as intravenous thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy, in pediatric stroke are limited, feasibility and safety data are mounting and support careful consideration of these treatments for childhood stroke. Recent therapeutic advances allow for targeted stroke prevention efforts in high-risk conditions, such as moyamoya, sickle cell disease, cardiac disease, and genetic disorders. Despite these exciting advances, important knowledge gaps persist, including optimal dosing and type of thrombolytic agents, inclusion criteria for mechanical thrombectomy, the role of immunomodulatory therapies for focal cerebral arteriopathy, optimal long-term antithrombotic strategies, the role of patent foramen ovale closure in pediatric stroke, and optimal rehabilitation strategies after stroke of the developing brain.
33176303	Hyperhaemolytic Syndrome in Sickle Cell Disease: Clearing the Cobwebs.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) presents with a dynamic background of haemolysis and deepening anaemia. This increases the demand for transfusion if any additional strain on haemopoiesis is encountered due to any other physiological or pathological causes. Patients with cerebrovascular accidents are placed on chronic blood transfusion; those with acute sequestration and acute chest syndrome are likewise managed with blood transfusion. These patients are prone to develop complications of blood transfusion including alloimmunization and hyperhaemolytic syndrome (HHS). This term is used to describe haemolysis of both transfused and "own" red cells occurring during or post-transfusion in sickle cell patients. Hyperhaemolysis results in worsening post-transfusion haemoglobin due attendant haemolysis of both transfused and autologous red cells. The mechanism underlying this rare and usually fatal complication of SCD has been thought to be secondary to changes in the red cell membrane with associated immunological reactions against exposed cell membrane phospholipids. The predisposition to HHS in sickle cell is also varied and the search for a prediction pattern or value has been evasive. This review discusses the pathogenesis, risk factors and treatment of HHS, elaborating on what is known of this rare condition.
31724788	Variation in hospital admission of sickle cell patients from the emergency department using the Pediatric Health Information System.	BACKGROUND: Universal newborn screening and improved treatment options have led to increased survival in sickle cell disease (SCD). However, patients with SCD still rely heavily on acute care services. OBJECTIVE: To determine the variation seen in hospitalizations for the top complaints for ED visits for children with SCD nationally. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of the Pediatric Health Information Systems (PHIS) Database between October 2011 and September 2015. Emergency department (ED) encounters were selected by using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Edition, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes for SCD with and without crisis, fever, and pain. Univariate analyses were performed, as well as index of dispersion (ID) to assess variation by day of the week and region. ANOVA and t-test were used to determine statistical significance. RESULTS: A total of 68 661 ED encounters at 36 hospitals met the criteria for inclusion. Of those encounters, 50.1% were admitted to the hospital. Pain and fever were the most common primary diagnoses among this population. Although variation in hospitalization was seen overall, as well as for a primary diagnosis of pain or fever, this variation was not explained by weekday/weekend designation. CONCLUSION: The results of our study confirm pain and fever as the most common primary diagnoses for children with SCD who seek acute care, as well as demonstrate that while significant variation in hospitalization exists, it is not associated with day of the week. Further studies to elucidate patient- and hospital-level factors that influence admission variation are necessary.
35791853	Barriers and Facilitators to Chronic Red Cell Transfusion Therapy in Pediatric Sickle Cell Anemia.	Background: Chronic red cell transfusion (CRCT) therapy is one of a few effective disease-modifying therapies for children with sickle cell anemia (SCA). CRCT is recommended for primary and secondary stroke prevention for at-risk children with SCA and is sometimes used for other disease-related complications. However, CRCT can be resource- and time-intensive for patients/families, providers, and organizations. This study was conducted to provide a comprehensive, multilevel examination of barriers and facilitators to transfusion therapy in children with SCA from health care provider and caregiver perspectives. Methods: A qualitative descriptive approach was used to conduct key informant interviews in a sample of 26 caregivers and 25 providers across the United States. Interviews were analyzed using directed content analysis with the Multilevel Ecological Model of Health as an initial coding framework and the constant comparison method. Results: Ten barrier themes and 10 facilitator themes emerged across all ecological levels. Themes most commonly occurred on the patient and organizational levels. Key barriers themes included Logistical Challenges, Obtaining and Maintaining Venous Access, Alloantibodies/Alloimmunization and Reactions, and Iron Overload and Adherence to Chelation Therapy. Key facilitator themes included Nursing and Non-nursing Staff Support, Positive Child/Family Experiences, Logistical Help and Social Resources, Blood Bank and Access to Blood, and Transfusion-Specific Resources. Discussion: The comprehensive understanding of multilevel barriers and facilitators to transfusion therapy, including the role of nursing, in children with SCA can inform strategies to improve CRCT for patients/families and providers and can also be applied by organizations seeking to implement transfusion services for SCA.
32469414	Assessment of Patient and Caregiver Attitudes and Approaches to Decision-Making Regarding Bone Marrow Transplant for Sickle Cell Disease: A Qualitative Study.	Importance: Bone marrow transplant (BMT) is a potentially curative treatment for sickle cell disease (SCD). Patient and caregiver attitudes toward BMT for SCD and the willingness to accept risks of BMT vary, but these attitudes are not well understood. Objective: To understand patient and caregiver perceptions of and attitudes toward BMT for SCD and decision-making about BMT. Design, Setting, and Participants: Qualitative study of interview transcripts from a convenience sample. Transcripts were from adults with SCD and caregivers of patients with SCD recruited from national and regional SCD conferences, symposia, and sickle cell clinics in 2 cities. Interview transcripts were used from the needs assessment phase to develop a patient-decision aid in 2013 to 2014 (group 1) and from the baseline point in 2015 to 2016 (group 2) of the parent trial, a randomized clinical trial of adults and caregivers of patients with SCD to evaluate the effectiveness of a patient decision aid. Main Outcomes and Measures: Participant perspectives on decision-making regarding BMT for SCD. Results: Fifty-seven transcripts from adults with SCD and 50 transcripts from caregivers of patients with SCD were included. Median (interquartile range [IQR]) age of adults with SCD was 34 (21-50) years in group 1 and 30 (23-38) years in group 2. The median (IQR) age of caregivers was 42.5 (31-52) years in group 1 and 41 (35-46.5) years in group 2. Most transcripts from adults with SCD (75.0% in group 1 and 72.4% in group 2) and caregivers of patients with SCD (76.7% in group 1 and 85.0% in group 2) were from female participants. Bone marrow transplant was perceived as a treatment option associated with serious risks. Reported attitudes toward BMT occurred on a continuum ranging from unfavorable to favorable. Participants reported serious decisional dilemma regarding BMT for SCD. Most participants expressed interest in learning about BMT or curative treatments. Conclusions and Relevance: This qualitative study found a continuum in attitudes toward BMT for SCD and highlights the complexity of decision-making in BMT for SCD. Patients and families with SCD expressed an interest in learning about BMT. Future prospective studies of patient decision-making regarding BMT, especially in the context of emerging curative and novel disease-modifying therapies for SCD, are warranted.
37742907	"Buprenorphine, It Works so Differently": Adults with Sickle Cell Disease Describe Transitioning to Buprenorphine for Treatment of Chronic Pain.	A growing body of literature describes the use of buprenorphine for the treatment of chronic pain in people with sickle cell disease. The experiences of people with sickle cell disease who have tried buprenorphine are not yet reported. This qualitative descriptive study was conducted to explore perspectives on buprenorphine for chronic pain in sickle cell disease. We interviewed 13 participants with sickle cell disease who had been prescribed buprenorphine and had a clinic visit between December 1, 2020 and April, 2022 in our Sickle Cell Center for Adults. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis. Eleven out of 13 participants were taking buprenorphine at the time of the interview, with mean treatment duration of 33 months (SD 18, range 7 to 78 months). Five major themes were identified: 1) dissatisfaction with full agonist opioids; 2) navigating uncertainty with autonomy in deciding to try buprenorphine; 3) functional and relational changes after starting buprenorphine, 4) enduring systemic barriers to pain treatment, and 5) trusting treatment relationships are necessary when approaching patients about buprenorphine. The experience of adulthood living with sickle cell disease before and after starting buprenorphine is qualitatively different with significant improvements in social functioning. PERSPECTIVE: This study examined the experience of adults with sickle cell disease and chronic pain transitioning from full agonist opioids to buprenorphine. It is the first qualitative study of buprenorphine in people with sickle cell disease, contributing to a small but growing literature about buprenorphine and sickle cell disease.
38246166	A new frontier: FDA approvals for gene therapy in sickle cell disease.	
34035408	Cost-effectiveness of a hypothetical cell or gene therapy cure for sickle cell disease.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of inherited genetic conditions associated with lifelong complications and increased healthcare resource utilization. Standard treatment for SCD in the US varies based on stage of the disease and observed clinical severity. In this study, we aim to evaluate the potential cost-effectiveness of a durable cell or gene therapy cure for sickle cell disease from the US healthcare sector perspective. We developed a lifetime Markov model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a hypothetical single-administration durable treatment (DT) for SCD provided at birth, relative to standard of care (SOC). We informed model inputs including direct healthcare costs, health state utility weights, transition probabilities, and mortality rates using a retrospective database analysis of commercially insured individuals and the medical literature. Our primary outcome of interest was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of DT versus SOC evaluated at a base case willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $150,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). We tested the robustness of our base case findings through scenario, deterministic sensitivity (DSA), and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA). In the base case analysis, treatment with DT was cost-effective with an ICER of $140,877/QALY relative to SOC for a hypothetical cohort involving 47% females. Both males (ICER of $135,574/QALY) and females (ICER of $146,511/QALY) were similarly cost-effective to treat. In univariate DSA the base case ICER was most sensitive to the costs of treating males, DT treatment cost, and the discount rate. In PSA, DT was cost-effective in 32.7%, 66.0%, and 92.6% of 10,000 simulations at WTP values of $100,000, $150,000, and $200,000 per QALY, respectively. A scenario analysis showed cost-effectiveness of DT is highly contingent on assumed lifetime durability of the cure. A hypothetical cell or gene therapy cure for SCD is likely to be cost-effective from the US healthcare sector perspective. Large upfront costs of a single administration cure are offset by significant downstream gains in health for patients treated early in life. We find cost-effectiveness outcomes do not vary substantially by gender; however, several model parameters including assumed durability and upfront cost of DT are likely to influence cost-effectiveness findings.
32201151	How to setup a successful transplant program for hemoglobinopathies in developing countries: The Cure2Children approach.	Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains the only established definitive cure for severe hemoglobinopathies, such as sickle cell disease (SCD) and thalassemia-the most prevalent life-threatening non-communicable disease of childhood globally. HSCT can not only cure over 85% of children with a compatible sibling but also restore normal health-related quality of life in most cases who do not have major irreversible organ damage at transplant. In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, SCD carrier rate can be up to 30% and 1% of live births have SCD. Relatively simple and inexpensive measures such as newborn screening, early diagnosis, caregiver education, and timely institution of anti-pneumococcal prophylaxis and hydroxyurea therapy can substantially reduce SCD-related mortality and morbidity. Improved prevention and early care should proceed in parallel with the development of transplant services and hope for cure. Cure2Children, an Italian NGO, has supported the startup of several bone marrow transplantation programs in LMICs where over 500 transplants have been performed over the last 10 years, with outcomes not substantially different from high-income countries but at a fraction of the cost. This report summarizes this experience and suggests some strategies to set up new HSCT units.
37309792	[Therapeutic approaches in sickle cell disease].	THERAPEUTIC APPROACHES IN SICKLE CELL DISEASE. Sickle cell disease, the most common genetic disease in France, is still burdened with morbidity and early mortality before the age of 50. When the first-line treatment, hydroxyurea, is insufficient or in the case of organic damage(s) (in particular cerebral vasculopathy), a therapeutic intensification must be considered. New molecules are now available, such as voxelotor and crizanlizumab, but only hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation can cure the disease. Allogeneic HSC transplantation during childhood with a sibling donor is the reference but it is now possible to perform this procedure in adults with a reduced pre-transplant conditioning. Gene therapy, which consists of an autograft of genetically modified HSCs, has obtained promising results but has not yet demonstrated a complete cure of the disease (protocols underway). The toxicity of myeloablative conditioning (used in pediatrics or for gene therapy), particularly the sterility induced, and the risk of graft-versushost disease (for allogeneic transplantation) are limiting factors of these treatments.
34669783	Comparative metavirome analysis in polytransfused patients.	Due to the high transfusion volume, polytransfused patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and beta-thalassemia are constantly exposed to parenterally transmitted infections. Currently, we have little information about the virome of such patients and how the virological composition might be influenced by the hemotherapy procedures that these patients receive. The objective of this study was to compare the viral diversity between these two groups with respect to the viral abundance and how it might be affected by the specific conditions of these groups. We sequenced by next-generation sequencing (NGS) and compared the virome of 30 patients with beta-thalassemia major, 45 with SCD, and 16 blood donors from the Blood Center of Ribeirao Preto, Brazil. Predominantly, commensal viruses including Torque teno virus (TTV) genotypes and human pegiviris-1 (HPgV-1) were identified in each group. Strikingly, while HPgV-1 reads were dominant in the SCD group, thalassemic patients showed high TTV abundance, expressed both in viral reads and genotypes. We speculated that the commensal virome of polytransfused patients might be influenced by the transfusion frequency and disease characteristics and that commensal viruses might be used as important genetic biomarkers for these hematological disturbances. Nevertheless, more specific studies are necessary to confirm a relationship between blood virome and transfusion treatment.
33264445	Impact of sickle cell disease on patients' daily lives, symptoms reported, and disease management strategies: Results from the international Sickle Cell World Assessment Survey (SWAY).	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder, characterized by hemolytic anemia and vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs). Data on the global SCD impact on quality of life (QoL) from the patient viewpoint are limited. The international Sickle Cell World Assessment Survey (SWAY) aimed to provide insights into patient-reported impact of SCD on QoL. This cross-sectional survey of SCD patients enrolled by healthcare professionals and advocacy groups assessed disease impact on daily life, education and work, symptoms, treatment goals, and disease management. Opinions were captured using a Likert scale of 1-7 for some questions; 5-7 indicated "high severity/impact." Two thousand one hundred and forty five patients (mean age 24.7 years [standard deviation (SD) = 13.1], 39% <=18 years, 52% female) were surveyed from 16 countries (six geographical regions). A substantial proportion of patients reported that SCD caused a high negative impact on emotions (60%) and school achievement (51%) and a reduction in work hours (53%). A mean of 5.3 VOCs (SD = 6.8) was reported over the 12 months prior to survey (median 3.0 [interquartile range 2.0-6.0]); 24% were managed at home and 76% required healthcare services. Other than VOCs, fatigue was the most commonly reported symptom in the month before survey (65%), graded "high severity" by 67% of patients. Depression and anxiety were reported by 39% and 38% of patients, respectively. The most common patient treatment goal was improving QoL (55%). Findings from SWAY reaffirm that SCD confers a significant burden on patients, epitomized by the high impact on patients' QoL and emotional wellbeing, and the high prevalence of self-reported VOCs and other symptoms.
38308541	Adverse pregnancy, fetal and neonatal outcomes in women with sickle cell disease in a Middle Eastern country.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease in pregnancy is associated with high maternal and fetal mortality. However, studies reporting pregnancy, fetal, and neonatal outcomes in women with sickle cell disease are extremely limited. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of the study are to determine whether women with sickle cell disease have a greater risk of adverse pregnancy, fetal, and neonatal outcomes than women without sickle cell disease and identify the predictors of adverse pregnancy, fetal, and neonatal outcomes in women with sickle cell disease. DESIGN: A retrospective pair-matched case-control study was conducted to compare 171 pregnant women with sickle cell disease to 171 pregnant women without sickle cell disease in Muscat, Sultanate of Oman. METHODS: All pregnant Omani women with sickle cell disease who delivered between January 2015 and August 2021 at Sultan Qaboos University Hospital and Royal Hospital, who were either primipara or multipara and who had a gestational age of 24-42 weeks, were included as patients, whereas women who had no sickle cell disease or any comorbidity during pregnancy, who delivered within the same timeframe and at the same hospitals, were recruited as controls. The data were retrieved from electronic medical records and delivery registry books between January 2015 and August 2021. RESULTS: Women with sickle cell disease who had severe anemia had increased odds of (chi2 = 58.56, p < 0.001) having adverse pregnancy outcomes. Women with sickle cell disease had 21.97% higher odds of delivering a baby with intrauterine growth retardation (chi2 = 17.80, unadjusted odds ratio = 2.91-166.13, p < 0.001). Newborns born to women with sickle cell disease had 3.93% greater odds of being admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (chi2 = 16.80, unadjusted odds ratio = 1.97-7.84, p < 0.001). In addition, the children born to women with sickle cell disease had 10.90% higher odds of being born with low birth weight (chi2 = 56.92, unadjusted odds ratio = 5.36-22.16, p < 0.001). Hemoglobin level (odds ratio = 0.17, p < 0.001, 95% confidence interval = 0.10-3.0), past medical history (odds ratio = 7.95, p < 0.001, 95% confidence interval = 2.39-26.43), past surgical history (odds ratio = 17.69, p < 0.001, 95% confidence interval = 3.41-91.76), and preterm delivery (odds ratio = 9.48, p = 0.005, 95% confidence interval = 1.95-46.23) were identified as predictors of adverse pregnancy, fetal, and neonatal outcomes in women with sickle cell disease. CONCLUSION: As pregnant women with sickle cell disease are at increased risk for pregnancy, fetal, and neonatal adverse outcomes; improved antenatal surveillance and management may improve the outcomes.
32814708	Curative in vivo hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy of murine thalassemia using large regulatory elements.	Recently, we demonstrated that hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) mobilization followed by intravenous injection of integrating, helper-dependent adenovirus HDAd5/35++ vectors resulted in efficient transduction of long-term repopulating cells and disease amelioration in mouse models after in vivo selection of transduced HSPCs. Acute innate toxicity associated with HDAd5/35++ injection was controlled by appropriate prophylaxis, making this approach feasible for clinical translation. Our ultimate goal is to use this technically simple in vivo HSPC transduction approach for gene therapy of thalassemia major or sickle cell disease. A cure of these diseases requires high expression levels of the therapeutic protein (gamma- or beta-globin), which is difficult to achieve with lentivirus vectors because of their genome size limitation not allowing larger regulatory elements to be accommodated. Here, we capitalized on the 35 kb insert capacity of HDAd5/35++ vectors to demonstrate that transcriptional regulatory regions of the beta-globin locus with a total length of 29 kb can efficiently be transferred into HSPCs. The in vivo HSPC transduction resulted in stable gamma-globin levels in erythroid cells that conferred a complete cure of murine thalassemia intermedia. Notably, this was achieved with a minimal in vivo HSPC selection regimen.
36018254	Simple open-heart surgery protocol for sickle-cell disease patients: a retrospective cohort study comparing patients undergoing mitral valve surgery.	OBJECTIVES: Sickle-cell disease (SCD) patients are considered to be at high risk from open-heart surgery. This study assessed the role of a simple sickling-prevention protocol. METHODS: Perioperative non-specific and SCD-specific morbidity and 30-day mortality are investigated in a retrospective cohort study on patients undergoing isolated mitral valve surgery. Patients with and without SCD were compared. In the SCD cohort, a bundle of interventions was applied to limit the risk of sickling: 'on-demand' transfusions to keep haemoglobin levels of around 7-8 g/dl, cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) with higher blood flow and perfusion temperature, close monitoring of acid-base balance and oxygenation. RESULTS: Twenty patients with and 40 patients without SCD were included. At baseline, only preoperative haemoglobin levels differed between cohorts (8.1 vs 11.8 g/dl, P < 0.001). Solely SCD patients received preoperative transfusions (45.0%). Intraoperative transfusions were significantly larger in SCD patients during CPB (priming: 300 vs 200 ml; entire length: 600 vs 300 ml and 20 vs 10 ml/kg). SCD patients had higher perfusion temperatures during CPB (34.7 vs 33.0 C, P = 0.01) with consequently higher pharyngeal temperature, both during cooling (34.1 vs 32.3 C, P = 0.02) and rewarming (36.5 vs 36.2 C, P = 0.02). No mortality occurred, and non-SCD-specific complications were comparable between groups, but one SCD patient suffered from perioperative cerebrovascular accident with seizures, and another had evident haemolysis. CONCLUSIONS: SCD patients may undergo open-heart surgery for mitral valve procedures with an acceptable risk profile. Simple but thoughtful perioperative management, embracing 'on-demand' transfusions and less-aggressive CPB cooling is feasible and probably efficacious.
38682445	Optimization of single-needle red cell exchange in patients with sickle cell disease.	The hypercoagulable state associated with sickle cell disease (SCD) can be challenging for apheresis procedures. Among 62 single-needle red cell exchanges (SN-RCEs) performed over a 15-month period, 4 patients experienced 6 hemolytic events with a discolored plasma layer, elevated plasma/RBC interface in the centrifuge, and accompanying alarms of "Cells were detected in plasma line from centrifuge" or "AIM system detected RBC at top of connector." The hemolysis originated from the apheresis instrument because samples from the apheresis belt but not the patients' peripheral blood were positive for hemolysis. Further analysis showed the alarms occurred more often in SN-RCEs (20.4%) than double-needle RCEs (2.7%), and the hemolysis was probably secondary to clumping. To optimize SN-RCE, we increased the anticoagulant dosage by changing Inlet/AC ratio from 13 to 8 and lowered the inlet rate to the level comparable to double-needle RCE. The adjustments were well-tolerated with no more hemolysis.

32200490	A Comprehensive Review of the Treatment and Management of Pain in Sickle Cell Disease.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a hematological disorder which leads to serious complications in multiple organ systems. While significant research has addressed many of the effects of acute pain episodes and end-organ damage connected to this disease, little has approached the chronic pain state associated with this condition. RECENT FINDINGS: Associated chronic pain represents a significant detractor from the quality of life experienced by these patients, affecting over half of those with SCD on more days than not. Current treatment typically is centered upon preventing and responding to acute vasoocclusive crises, presumably because this is the most common reason for hospitalization in these patients. The lack of management of chronic pain symptoms leaves many with SCD in a state of suffering. In this review, the treatment methodologies of SCD patients are examined including alternative treatments, both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical, as well as procedural approaches specifically aimed at reducing chronic pain in these patients.
33877274	Effect of Poloxamer 188 vs Placebo on Painful Vaso-Occlusive Episodes in Children and Adults With Sickle Cell Disease: A Randomized Clinical Trial.	Importance: Although effective agents are available to prevent painful vaso-occlusive episodes of sickle cell disease (SCD), there are no disease-modifying therapies for ongoing painful vaso-occlusive episodes; treatment remains supportive. A previous phase 3 trial of poloxamer 188 reported shortened duration of painful vaso-occlusive episodes in SCD, particularly in children and participants treated with hydroxyurea. Objective: To reassess the efficacy of poloxamer 188 for vaso-occlusive episodes. Design, Setting, and Participants: Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, international trial conducted from May 2013 to February 2016 that included 66 hospitals in 12 countries and 60 cities; 388 individuals with SCD (hemoglobin SS, SC, S-beta0 thalassemia, or S-beta+ thalassemia disease) aged 4 to 65 years with acute moderate to severe pain typical of painful vaso-occlusive episodes requiring hospitalization were included. Interventions: A 1-hour 100-mg/kg loading dose of poloxamer 188 intravenously followed by a 12-hour to 48-hour 30-mg/kg/h continuous infusion (n = 194) or placebo (n = 194). Main Outcomes and Measures: Time in hours from randomization to the last dose of parenteral opioids among all participants and among those younger than 16 years as a separate subgroup. Results: Of 437 participants assessed for eligibility, 388 were randomized (mean age, 15.2 years; 176 [45.4%] female), the primary outcome was available for 384 (99.0%), 15-day follow-up contacts were available for 357 (92.0%), and 30-day follow-up contacts were available for 368 (94.8%). There was no significant difference between the groups for the mean time to last dose of parenteral opioids (81.8 h for the poloxamer 188 group vs 77.8 h for the placebo group; difference, 4.0 h [95% CI, -7.8 to 15.7]; geometric mean ratio, 1.2 [95% CI, 1.0-1.5]; P = .09). Based on a significant interaction of age and treatment (P = .01), there was a treatment difference in time from randomization to last administration of parenteral opioids for participants younger than 16 years (88.7 h in the poloxamer 188 group vs 71.9 h in the placebo group; difference, 16.8 h [95% CI, 1.7-32.0]; geometric mean ratio, 1.4 [95% CI, 1.1-1.8]; P = .008). Adverse events that were more common in the poloxamer 188 group than the placebo group included hyperbilirubinemia (12.7% vs 5.2%); those more common in the placebo group included hypoxia (12.0% vs 5.3%). Conclusions and Relevance: Among children and adults with SCD, poloxamer 188 did not significantly shorten time to last dose of parenteral opioids during vaso-occlusive episodes. These findings do not support the use of poloxamer 188 for vaso-occlusive episodes. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01737814.

34470050	Decreased parasite burden and altered host response in children with sickle cell anemia and severe anemia with malaria.	Plasmodium falciparum malaria causes morbidity and mortality in African children with sickle cell anemia (SCA), but comparisons of host responses to P falciparum between children with SCA (homozygous sickle cell disease/hemoglobin SS [HbSS]) and normal hemoglobin genotype/hemoglobin AA (HbAA) are limited. We assessed parasite biomass and plasma markers of inflammation and endothelial activation in children with HbAA (n = 208) or HbSS (n = 22) who presented with severe anemia and P falciparum parasitemia to Mulago Hospital in Kampala, Uganda. Genotyping was performed at study completion. No child had known SCA at enrollment. Children with HbSS did not differ from children with HbAA in peripheral parasite density, but had significantly lower sequestered parasite biomass. Children with HbSS had greater leukocytosis but significantly lower concentrations of several plasma inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). In contrast, children with HbSS had threefold greater concentrations of angiopoietin-2 (Angpt-2), a marker of endothelial dysregulation associated with mortality in severe malaria. Lower TNF-alpha concentrations were associated with increased risk of postdischarge mortality or readmission, whereas higher Angpt-2 concentrations were associated with increased risk of recurrent clinical malaria. Children with SCA have decreased parasite sequestration and inflammation but increased endothelial dysregulation during severe anemia with P falciparum parasitemia, which may ameliorate acute infectious complications but predispose to harmful long-term sequelae.
34203861	Critical Role of Hemopexin Mediated Cytoprotection in the Pathophysiology of Sickle Cell Disease.	Circulating hemopexin is the primary protein responsible for the clearance of heme; therefore, it is a systemic combatant against deleterious inflammation and oxidative stress induced by the presence of free heme. This role of hemopexin is critical in hemolytic pathophysiology. In this review, we outline the current research regarding how the dynamic activity of hemopexin is implicated in sickle cell disease, which is characterized by a pathological aggregation of red blood cells and excessive hemolysis. This pathophysiology leads to symptoms such as acute kidney injury, vaso-occlusion, ischemic stroke, pain crises, and pulmonary hypertension exacerbated by the presence of free heme and hemoglobin. This review includes in vivo studies in mouse, rat, and guinea pig models of sickle cell disease, as well as studies in human samples. In summary, the current research indicates that hemopexin is likely protective against these symptoms and that rectifying depleted hemopexin in patients with sickle cell disease could improve or prevent the symptoms. The data compiled in this review suggest that further preclinical and clinical research should be conducted to uncover pathways of hemopexin in pathological states to evaluate its potential clinical function as both a biomarker and therapy for sickle cell disease and related hemoglobinopathies.
33668588	Mechanisms of Bone Impairment in Sickle Bone Disease.	Sickle bone disease (SBD) is a chronic and invalidating complication of Sickle cell disease (SCD), a multisystem autosomal recessive genetic disorder affecting millions of people worldwide. Mechanisms involved in SBD are not completely known, especially in pediatric age. Among the hypothesized pathogenetic mechanisms underlying SBD are bone marrow compensatory hyperplasia and bone ischemic damage, both secondary to vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC), which leads to cell sickling, thus worsening local hypoxia with a negative impact on osteoblast recruitment. Furthermore, the hypoxia is a strong activator of erythropoietin, which in turn stimulates osteoclast precursors and induces bone loss. Hemolysis and iron overload due to a chronic transfusion regimen could also contribute to the onset of bone complications. Vitamin D deficiency, which is frequently seen in SCD subjects, may worsen SBD by increasing the resorptive state that is responsible for low bone mineral density, acute/chronic bone pain, and high fracture risk. An imbalance between osteoblasts and osteoclasts, with a relative decrease of osteoblast recruitment and activity, is a further possible mechanism responsible for the impairment of bone health in SCD. Moreover, delayed pubertal growth spurt and low peak bone mass may explain the high incidence of fracture in SCD adolescents. The aim of this review was to focus on the pathogenesis of SBD, updating the studies on biochemical, instrumental, and biological markers of bone metabolism. We also evaluated the growth development and endocrine complications in subjects affected with SCD.

36606705	Intranasal fentanyl and discharge from the emergency department among children with sickle cell disease and vaso-occlusive pain: A multicenter pediatric emergency medicine perspective.	Children with sickle cell disease (SCD) commonly experience vaso-occlusive pain episodes (VOE) due to sickling of erythrocytes, which often requires care in the emergency department. Our objective was to assess the use and impact of intranasal fentanyl for the treatment of children with SCD-VOE on discharge from the emergency department in a multicenter study. We conducted a cross-sectional study at 20 academic pediatric emergency departments in the United States and Canada. We used logistic regression to test bivariable and multivariable associations between the outcome of discharge from the emergency department and candidate variables theoretically associated with discharge. The study included 400 patients; 215 (54%) were female. The median age was 14.6 (interquartile range 9.8, 17.6) years. Nineteen percent (n = 75) received intranasal fentanyl in the emergency department. Children who received intranasal fentanyl had nearly nine-fold greater adjusted odds of discharge from the emergency department compared to those who did not (adjusted odds ratio 8.99, 95% CI 2.81-30.56, p < .001). The rapid onset of action and ease of delivery without intravenous access offered by intranasal fentanyl make it a feasible initial parenteral analgesic in the treatment of children with SCD presenting with VOE in the acute-care setting. Further study is needed to determine potential causality of the association between intranasal fentanyl and discharge from the emergency department observed in this multicenter study.

32248201	Possible Propofol-Induced Priapism Following Cardiac Catheter Ablation in a Teenager.	BACKGROUND Priapism is rarely reported as a potential complication after the cardiac ablation procedure. We report the case of a teenager admitted for atrial flutter ablation who developed priapism following the procedure. CASE REPORT A 16-year-old male with episodic atrial flutter came to our hospital for an electrophysiological study and catheter ablation. During the procedure, he was given IV propofol for anesthesia and IV heparin for anticoagulation. After the procedure, nursing noted that he had an erection, which persisted for 5 h, with complaints of discomfort. There was no known history of sickle cell disease or trauma to the perineum, nor did he endorse any prior prolonged erections. On physical examination, he had a circumcised phallus with rigid and non-tender corpora cavernosa. He was given 5 mg terbutaline PO, without improvement. Three hours later, a second dose of terbutaline was given. In addition, a penis corporal venous blood gas was taken, and the result was consistent with an ischemic priapism. He had detumescence 1-2 min later. The total duration of his priapism was 8 h. There was no swelling, pain, or any sequelae after detumescence. CONCLUSIONS Although priapism rarely occurs as a complication following catheter ablation procedures due to propofol use, prolonged priapism can result in corporal fibrosis and cause future erectile dysfunction. Recognition and treatment of priapism in the postoperative period may be delayed due to a patient's hesitance to express concerns. To prevent future erectile dysfunction, signs of priapism should be included in routine postoperative evaluation in male patients.
34001792	Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in a Pediatric Patient With Sickle Cell Disease and COVID-19: A Case Report.	To this day, there are limited data about the effects and management of coronavirus disease infection in pediatric patients with sickle cell disease. We present the management and successful clinical course of an 8-year-old female with homozygous sickle cell disease (SS) and severe acute chest syndrome secondary to coronavirus disease 2019 infection, complicated by cortical vein thrombosis.
35139577	Main Complications during Pregnancy and Recommendations for Adequate Antenatal Care in Sickle Cell Disease: A Literature Review.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common monogenic disease worldwide, with a variable prevalence in each continent. A single nucleotide substitution leads to an amino-acid change in the beta-globin chain, altering the normal structure ofhemoglobin, which is then called hemoglobin S inherited in homozygosity (HbSS) or double heterozygosity (HbSC, HbSbeta), and leads to chronic hemolysis, vaso-occlusion, inflammation, and endothelium activation. Pregnant women with SCD are at a higher risk of developing maternal and perinatal complications. We performed a narrative review of the literature considering SCD and pregnancy, the main clinical and obstetrical complications, the specific antenatal care, and the follow-up for maternal and fetal surveillance. Pregnant women with SCD are at a higher risk of developing clinical and obstetric complications such as pain episodes, pulmonary complications, infections, thromboembolic events, preeclampsia, and maternal death. Their newborns are also at an increased risk of developing neonatal complications: fetal growth restriction, preterm birth, stillbirth. Severe complications can occur in patients of any genotype. We concluded that SCD is a high-risk condition that increases maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. A multidisciplinary approach during pregnancy and the postpartum period is key to adequately diagnose and treat complications.
32506514	Liver transplantation in patients with sickle cell disease: possible but challenging-a cohort study.	The liver is frequently affected in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), but few reports have described liver transplantation (LT) in patients with SCD. We present a thorough analysis of the largest single-center series of LT in patients with SCD and the first systematic review. There were 21 patients with a median age of 37.6 years. LT was performed for acute liver failure related to the sickling process (57%) or electively for end-stage liver disease (43%). Prior to LT, 13 patients (62%) were in the intensive care unit and required mechanical ventilation (33%), vasopressor therapy (24%), renal replacement therapy (10%), or molecular adsorbent recirculating system therapy (19%). Post-LT morbidity and mortality were 95% and 33%, respectively. Patient survival at 1 and 5 years were 58.3% and 41.7%, respectively, in the urgent group and 88.9% and 77.8%, respectively, in the elective group. A total of 22 transplant patients with SCD are described in 20 articles in the literature. The 1- and 5-year patient survival rates for the 18 evaluable patients were 75% and 65%, respectively. LT improves survival in patients with SCD and acute liver failure or end-stage liver disease but is associated with high morbidity during the early postoperative course.
33349018	Hyperacute Recanalization Strategies and Childhood Stroke in the Evidence Age.	No controlled pharmacological studies are available in the field of pediatric stroke, except for sickle cell disease. Therefore, while pharmacological and mechanical recanalization treatments have repeatedly shown clinical benefit in adults with arterial ischemic stroke, pediatric strokologists still cannot base their therapeutic management (including hyperacute strategies) on high-level evidence. Once again, pediatricians face the same dichotomic choice: adapting adult procedures now versus waiting-for a long time-for the corresponding pediatric trials. One way out is building a compromise based on observational studies with large, longitudinal, comprehensive, real-life, and multisource dataset. Two recent high-quality observational studies have delivered promising conclusions on recanalization treatments in pediatric arterial ischemic stroke. TIPSTER (Thrombolysis in Pediatric Stroke Extended Results) showed that the risk of severe intracranial hemorrhage after intravenous thrombolysis is low; the Save Childs Study reported encouraging data about pediatric thrombectomy. Beyond the conclusion of a satisfactory global safety profile, a thorough analysis of the methods, populations, results, and therapeutic complications of these studies helps us to refine indications/contraindications and highlights the safeguards we need to rely on when discussing thrombolysis and thrombectomy in children. In conclusion, pediatric strokologists should not refrain from using clot lysis/retrieval tools in selected children with arterial ischemic stroke. But the implementation of hyperacute care is only feasible if the right candidate is identified through the sharing of common adult/pediatric protocols and ward collaboration, formalized well before the child's arrival. These anticipated protocols should never undervalue contraindications from adult guidelines and must involve the necessary pediatric expertise when facing specific causes of stroke, such as focal cerebral arteriopathy of childhood.
37023228	Proinflammatory state promotes red blood cell alloimmunization in pediatric patients with sickle cell disease.	We examined risk factors for RBC alloimmunization in pediatric patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), focusing on recipients' inflammatory state at the time of transfusion and anti-inflammatory role of hydroxyurea (HU). Among 471 participants, 55 (11.70%) participants were alloimmunized and formed 59 alloantibodies and 17 autoantibodies with an alloimmunization rate of 0.36 alloantibodies per 100 units. Analysis of 27 participants who formed alloantibodies with specificities showed 23.8% (30/126) of units transfused during a proinflammatory event resulted in alloantibody formation compared to 2.8% (27/952) of units transfused at steady state. Therefore, transfusion during proinflammatory events increased the risk for alloimmunization (odds ratio [OR]: 4.22; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.64-10.85; p = 0.003). Further analysis of all the 471 participants showed alloimmunization of episodically transfused patients who received transfusion mostly during proinflammatory events was not reduced by HU therapy (OR: 6.52; 95% CI: 0.85-49.77; p = 0.071), HU therapy duration (OR: 1.13; 95% CI: 0.997-1.28; p = 0.056) or HU dose (OR: 1.06; 95% CI: 0.96-1.16; p = 0.242). The analysis also identified high transfusion burden (OR: 1.02; 95% CI: 1.003-1.04; p = 0.020) and HbSS and HbSbeta0-thalassemia genotypes (OR: 11.22, 95% CI: 1.51-83.38, p = 0.018) as additional risk factors for alloimmunization. In conclusion, the inflammatory state of transfusion recipients affects the risk of RBC alloimmunization, which is not modified by HU therapy. Judicious use of transfusion during proinflammatory events is critical for preventing alloimmunization.

36762634	Stroke in the young.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to review recent findings regarding stroke epidemiology, etiologies, and treatment in children and young adults. RECENT FINDINGS: Incidence in young adults is increasing, and incidence, recurrence, and survival is worse in patients with cryptogenic stroke and in developing countries. Careful consideration of patent foramen ovale closure is now recommended in young adults with cryptogenic stroke. Thrombectomy has recently been extended to carefully selected children with acute ischemic stroke, and two recent publications strongly suggest that it can be beneficial for children. Sickle cell is also an important global contributor to stroke burden, but hydroxyurea can be a cost effective medication for stroke prevention in children. Recent advances in genetic testing and treatments may improve outcomes for patients with monogenic causes of stroke, such as deficiency of adenosine deaminase 2, hemophilia, and Fabry's disease. SUMMARY: Stroke in children and young adults is a morbid disease responsible for enormous indirect societal costs and a high burden of years with disability per affected patient. Recent advances have improved access to care for children with large vessel occlusion and adults with rare causes of stroke. Future research may bring effective treatments for other monogenic causes of stroke as well as increasing access to hyperacute therapies for young stroke patients.
36040484	Normalization of cerebral hemodynamics after hematopoietic stem cell transplant in children with sickle cell disease.	Children with sickle cell disease (SCD) demonstrate cerebral hemodynamic stress and are at high risk of strokes. We hypothesized that curative hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) normalizes cerebral hemodynamics in children with SCD compared with pre-transplant baseline. Whole-brain cerebral blood flow (CBF) and oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) were measured by magnetic resonance imaging 1 to 3 months before and 12 to 24 months after HSCT in 10 children with SCD. Three children had prior overt strokes, 5 children had prior silent strokes, and 1 child had abnormal transcranial Doppler ultrasound velocities. CBF and OEF of HSCT recipients were compared with non-SCD control participants and with SCD participants receiving chronic red blood cell transfusion therapy (CRTT) before and after a scheduled transfusion. Seven participants received matched sibling donor HSCT, and 3 participants received 8 out of 8 matched unrelated donor HSCT. All received reduced-intensity preparation and maintained engraftment, free of hemolytic anemia and SCD symptoms. Pre-transplant, CBF (93.5 mL/100 g/min) and OEF (36.8%) were elevated compared with non-SCD control participants, declining significantly 1 to 2 years after HSCT (CBF, 72.7 mL/100 g per minute; P = .004; OEF, 27.0%; P = .002), with post-HSCT CBF and OEF similar to non-SCD control participants. Furthermore, HSCT recipients demonstrated greater reduction in CBF (-19.4 mL/100 g/min) and OEF (-8.1%) after HSCT than children with SCD receiving CRTT after a scheduled transfusion (CBF, -0.9 mL/100 g/min; P = .024; OEF, -3.3%; P = .001). Curative HSCT normalizes whole-brain hemodynamics in children with SCD. This restoration of cerebral oxygen reserve may explain stroke protection after HSCT in this high-risk patient population.
37151019	Self-management for sickle cell disease among patients and parents: A qualitative study.	OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore self-management practices among patients and parents of children with sickle cell disease (SCD). METHODS: The qualitative descriptive design was employed. The study involved 19 participants comprising adult SCD patients >=16 years, and nine parents of SCD children <= 15 years. Purposive sampling was conducted to select participants from a teaching hospital and SCD association. Data was collected using one-on-one interviews, transcribed verbatim, and analysed using qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Self-management was reported through four categories including preventive health, self-monitoring, self-diagnosis, and self-treatment. Hydration, nutrition, activity limitation, avoidance of cold temperatures, and supportive medications were the most common preventive health actions. Regarding self-monitoring and self-diagnosis, the parents emphasized objective indicators such as changes in urine and eye colour compared to the adults who utilize subjective indicators such as feeling unwell and easy fatigue. Pharmacological and non-pharmacological measures were reported by both groups for treating painful episodes, fever, leg ulcers, priapism, and unspecified symptoms. DISCUSSION: The participants in this study practice several self-management actions with some differences in application between adults and children. Tailored self-management services may be helpful for adults and children when developing services for SCD patients.
32841705	Efficacy and safety of recently approved drugs for sickle cell disease: a review of clinical trials.	Sickle cell disease is prevalent in several parts of the world. Most hospitalizations of these patients are related to pain crisis episodes. Moreover, levels of hemoglobin are lower in sickle cell disease patients as compared with the general population. Complications related to sickle cell disease are managed with blood transfusions, hydroxyurea, and opioids. Despite these therapies, patients with sickle cell disease experience multiple pain crisis episodes leading to hospitalizations and end-organ damage. The US Food and Drug Administration has approved three new drugs-L-glutamine, voxelotor, and crizanlizumab-for the prophylaxis and treatment of complications related to sickle cell disease. This review was aimed at assessing the efficacy and safety of recently approved drugs for the treatment of sickle cell disease. A comprehensive search was made on PubMed and clinicaltrials.gov to look for clinical trials reporting the efficacy and safety of recently approved drugs for sickle cell disease. Based on the results of clinical trials, L-glutamine, voxelotor, and crizanlizumab were well tolerated by sickle cell disease patients. L-Glutamine and crizanlizumab reduced the number of sickle cell crisis episodes, while voxelotor improved the level of hemoglobin in sickle cell disease patients. These drugs were effective alone and in combination with hydroxyurea.
33775851	An extensive review to facilitate understanding of CRISPR technology as a gene editing possibility for enhanced therapeutic applications.	CRISPR are the sequences in bacterial and archaeal genome which provide resistance against viral infections. They might be the natural part of bacterial genomes for providing protection against viruses like bacteriophages but science has successfully achieved their use in the benefit of man-kind by using them for the treatment of deadly diseases like cancer, AIDS or genetic disorders like sickle cell disease and Leber congenital amaurosis. CRISPR system is majorly divided into two classes i.e class I and class II, of which the class II CRISPR/Cas9 system performs site specific cleavage of DNA with a guide RNA Cas12 (Cpf1). With the new emerging discoveries it is being found that CRISPR not only works on double stranded DNA but can also be useful to induce any sort of site specific cleavage in RNA too by Cas13 earlier known as C2c2, which is a protein found in CRISPR system and has ability to cure viral infections in plants. CRISPR is being used in the field of gene manipulation and various animals models are available to serve this purpose with short lifespan, rapid reproducibility and lower maintenance cost. Many successful studies and experiments performed using CRISPR, reveals their potency and utility to bring revolution in the areas which were previously believed to be out of scope of science and medicine.
34101983	SNAP: Supportive noninvasive ventilation for acute chest syndrome prevention in children with sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Acute chest syndrome (ACS) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among children with sickle cell disease (SCD). Preventing hypoxemia by optimizing lung aeration during sleep remains a challenge. OBJECTIVES: To explore safety, feasibility, and tolerability of noninvasive, bi-level positive airway pressure ventilation (BiPAP) as preventative, supportive care for hospitalized, medically stable children with SCD on a general pediatric inpatient unit. METHODS: Retrospective chart review of patients <=22 years of age with SCD admitted to the general pediatric inpatient unit from February 1, 2017 to March 1, 2020 for whom BiPAP was recommended as supportive care. Hospitalizations were excluded if patients were admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), required BiPAP for respiratory failure, or used BiPAP at home for obstructive sleep apnea. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients had 53 hospitalizations in which BiPAP was recommended. Fifty-two (98%) hospitalizations included acute SCD pain. Indications for BiPAP included prior ACS (94%), chest or back pain (79%), and/or oxygen desaturation (66%). On 17 occasions, patients already had mild to moderate ACS but were stable when BiPAP was recommended. BiPAP was used successfully during 75% of hospitalizations for a median of two nights. There were no adverse effects associated with BiPAP. PICU transfer for respiratory support occurred during three hospitalizations. In 26 hospitalizations of children at risk for ACS who tolerated BiPAP, 23 (88%) did not develop ACS. CONCLUSIONS: BiPAP is safe, feasible, and well tolerated as supportive care for hospitalized children with SCD. Next steps include an intervention trial to further assess the efficacy of BiPAP on ACS prevention.
38331925	Role of hydroxyurea therapy in the prevention of organ damage in sickle cell disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.	BACKGROUND: Hydroxyurea is an affordable drug that reduces vaso-occlusive crises and transfusion requirements in sickle cell disease. However, its effectiveness in preventing chronic organ damage is still unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the role of hydroxyurea in preventing organ morbidity. METHOD: We included original articles published in English from 1st January 1990 to 31st January 2023, reporting hydroxyurea therapy and organ damage from PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, and CrossRef databases. A total of 45 studies with 4681 sickle cell disease patients were evaluated for organ damage. RESULTS: Our analysis showed that hydroxyurea intervention significantly lowered transcranial Doppler and tricuspid regurgitant velocity, with a standardized mean difference of - 1.03 (- 1.49; - 0.58); I 2 = 96% and - 1.37 (CI - 2.31, - 0.42); I 2 = 94%, respectively. Moreover, the pooled estimate for albuminuria showed a beneficial effect post-hydroxyurea therapy by reducing the risk of albuminuria by 58% (risk ratio of 0.42 (0.28; 0.63); I 2 = 28%). CONCLUSION: Our study found that a hydroxyurea dose above 20 mg/kg/day with a mean rise in HbF by 18.46% post-hydroxyurea therapy had a beneficial role in reducing transcranial doppler velocity, tricuspid regurgitant velocity, albuminuria, and splenic abnormality.

33955552	Transfusion management of severe anaemia in African children: a consensus algorithm.	The phase III Transfusion and Treatment of severe anaemia in African Children Trial (TRACT) found that conservative management of uncomplicated severe anaemia [haemoglobin (Hb) 40-60 g/l] was safe, and that transfusion volume (20 vs. 30 ml/kg whole blood equivalent) for children with severe anaemia (Hb <60 g/l) had strong but opposing effects on mortality, depending on fever status (>37 5 C). In 2020 a stakeholder meeting of paediatric and blood transfusion groups from Africa reviewed the results and additional analyses. Among all 3196 children receiving an initial transfusion there was no evidence that nutritional status, presence of shock, malaria parasite burden or sickle cell disease status influenced outcomes or modified the interaction with fever status on volume required. Fever status at the time of ordering blood was a reliable determinant of volume required for optimal outcome. Elevated heart and respiratory rates normalised irrespective of transfusion volume and without diuretics. By consensus, a transfusion management algorithm was developed, incorporating three additional measurements of Hb post-admission, alongside clinical monitoring. The proposed algorithm should help clinicians safely implement findings from TRACT. Further research should assess its implementation in routine clinical practice.
37016392	Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine or sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine for the chemoprevention of malaria in children with sickle cell anaemia in eastern and southern Africa (CHEMCHA): a protocol for a multi-centre, two-arm, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled superiority trial.	BACKGROUND: An estimated 300,000 babies are born with sickle cell anaemia (SCA) annually. Affected children have chronic ill health and suffer premature death. Febrile illnesses such as malaria commonly precipitate acute crises in children with SCA. Thus, chemoprophylaxis for malaria is an important preventive strategy, but current regimes are either sub-optimally effective (e.g. monthly sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine, SP) or difficult to adhere to (e.g. daily proguanil). We propose dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) as the agent with the most potential to be used across Africa. METHODS: This will be a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group superiority trial of weekly single-day courses of DP compared to monthly single-day courses of SP in children with SCA. The study will be conducted in eastern (Uganda) and southern (Malawi) Africa using randomisation stratified by body weight and study centre. Participants will be randomised using an allocation of 1:1 to DP or SP. We will investigate the efficacy, safety, acceptability and uptake and cost-effectiveness of malaria chemoprevention with weekly courses of DP vs monthly SP in 548 to 824 children with SCA followed up for 12-18 months. We will also assess toxicity from cumulative DP dosing and the development of resistance. Participant recruitment commenced on 30 April 2021; follow-up is ongoing. DISCUSSION: At the end of this study, findings will be used to inform regional health policy. This manuscript is prepared from protocol version 2.1 dated 1 January 2022. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04844099 . Registered on 08 April 2021.
38429041	The Inequality of Pain Control in Patients With Pain From Sickle Cell Disease: A Case Report.	Approximately 100,000 people in the United States are affected by Sickle Cell Disease (SCD). Acute pain and chronic pain are common and are experienced by everyone with SCD. Children and adolescents who had pain from SCD reported daily pain, decreased function, missed school/workdays, and limited participation in recreational and social activities. This case report aims to highlight the lack of diversity, equity, and inclusion of pain control through the lens of a patient with SCD to improve clinical practice.
32470438	Evaluation of the efficacy and safety of deferiprone compared with deferasirox in paediatric patients with transfusion-dependent haemoglobinopathies (DEEP-2): a multicentre, randomised, open-label, non-inferiority, phase 3 trial.	BACKGROUND: Transfusion-dependent haemoglobinopathies require lifelong iron chelation therapy with one of the three iron chelators (deferiprone, deferasirox, or deferoxamine). Deferasirox and deferiprone are the only two oral chelators used in adult patients with transfusion-dependent haemoglobinopathies. To our knowledge, there are no randomised clinical trials comparing deferiprone, a less expensive iron chelator, with deferasirox in paediatric patients. We aimed to show the non-inferiority of deferiprone versus deferasirox. METHODS: DEEP-2 was a phase 3, multicentre, randomised trial in paediatric patients (aged 1 month to 18 years) with transfusion-dependent haemoglobinopathies. The study was done in 21 research hospitals and universities in Italy, Egypt, Greece, Albania, Cyprus, Tunisia, and the UK. Participants were receiving at least 150 mL/kg per year of red blood cells for the past 2 years at the time of enrolment, and were receiving deferoxamine (<100 mg/kg per day) or deferasirox (<40 mg/kg per day; deferasirox is not registered for use in children aged <2 years so only deferoxamine was being used in these patients). Any previous chelation treatment was permitted with a 7-day washout period. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive orally administered daily deferiprone (75-100 mg/kg per day) or daily deferasirox (20-40 mg/kg per day) administered as dispersible tablets, both with dose adjustment for 12 months, stratified by age (<10 years and >=10 years) and balanced by country. The primary efficacy endpoint was based on predefined success criteria for changes in serum ferritin concentration (all patients) and cardiac MRI T2-star (T2*; patients aged >10 years) to show non-inferiority of deferiprone versus deferasirox in the per-protocol population, defined as all randomly assigned patients who received the study drugs and had available data for both variables at baseline and after 1 year of treatment, without major protocol violations. Non-inferiority was based on the two-sided 95% CI of the difference in the proportion of patients with treatment success between the two groups and was shown if the lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI was greater than -12 5%. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This study is registered with EudraCT, 2012-000353-31, and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01825512. FINDINGS: 435 patients were enrolled between March 17, 2014, and June 16, 2016, 393 of whom were randomly assigned to a treatment group (194 to the deferiprone group; 199 to the deferasirox group). 352 (90%) of 390 patients had beta-thalassaemia major, 27 (7%) had sickle cell disease, five (1%) had thalassodrepanocytosis, and six (2%) had other haemoglobinopathies. Median follow-up was 379 days (IQR 294-392) for deferiprone and 381 days (350-392) for deferasirox. Non-inferiority of deferiprone versus deferasirox was established (treatment success in 69 [55 2%] of 125 patients assigned deferiprone with primary composite efficacy endpoint data available at baseline and 1 year vs 80 [54 8%] of 146 assigned deferasirox, difference 0 4%; 95% CI -11 9 to 12 6). No significant difference between the groups was shown in the occurrence of serious and drug-related adverse events. Three (2%) cases of reversible agranulocytosis occurred in the 193 patients in the safety analysis in the deferiprone group and two (1%) cases of reversible renal and urinary disorders (one case of each) occurred in the 197 patients in the deferasirox group. Compliance was similar between treatment groups: 183 (95%) of 193 patients in the deferiprone group versus 192 (97%) of 197 patients in the deferisirox group. INTERPRETATION: In paediatric patients with transfusion-dependent haemoglobinopathies, deferiprone was effective and safe in inducing control of iron overload during 12 months of treatment. Considering the need for availability of more chelation treatments in paediatric populations, deferiprone offers a valuable treatment option for this age group.

33524905	Motivations and deterrents toward blood donation in Kampala, Uganda.	Severe malaria, hemorrhage during childbirth, sickle cell anemia, injury from road accidents, and other medical conditions that necessitate blood transfusions affect thousands of Ugandans every year. However, only 0.3-0.5% of the population donates blood, which is less than half of the proportion recommended by the World Health Organization to maintain a sufficient supply in blood banks and health facilities. In January 2018, Uganda faced crisis level blood shortages, increasing preventable deaths in the country as patients lacked access to life-saving transfusions. To understand the factors that impact a person's decision to give blood and to inform public health campaigns that seek to promote donation, researchers collaborated with Uganda Blood Transfusion Services (UBTS) and the Uganda Red Cross Society (URCS), the primary actors in blood donation in Uganda, to conduct 50 semi-structured in-depth interviews with blood donors and non-donors and 22 key informant interviews with UBTS and URCS staff members. Through qualitative data analysis using Dedoose software, this study identified several key motivations that promote donation, including altruism, civic duty, and opportunities for disease testing, as well as important deterrents, including fear of needles and blood and lack of awareness of or access to blood donation drives. Results have been shared with blood collection agencies to inform public health campaigns that seek to dispel fears and promote motivations toward donation to increase the blood supply and decrease preventable deaths in Uganda.
37939876	Prevention of neurovascular complications in children with Sickle Cell Disease in the real-world setting: What adult medicine physicians should know.	Neurovascular complications represent one of the most detrimental manifestations of Sickle Cell Disease (SCD), affecting many patients since infancy. They include overt stroke, silent cerebral infarcts and neurocognitive disorders. In fact, neurodevelopment can be impaired in children resulting in cognitive dysfunction in adults with SCD. This review is meant to resume the most recent guidelines about the prevention of SCD neurovascular complications and to highlight the open challenges in their implementation. Transcranial Doppler, Magnetic Resonance Imaging/Angiography and neurocognitive test are useful screening tools. Chronic transfusion regimen, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and neurocognitive rehabilitation find indications in the context of primary and secondary prevention of neurovascular complications of SCD. However, international guidelines are often difficult to bring into the real world due to the lack of appropriate instruments and trained personnel. Many challenges have still to be faced to guarantee the best possible neurocognitive function to each child affected by SCD.
34102090	Chronic opioid use in patients with sickle cell disease.	
33956057	Disease severity impacts plerixafor-mobilized stem cell collection in patients with sickle cell disease.	Recent studies suggest that plerixafor mobilization and apheresis in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) is safe and can allow collection of sufficient CD34+ hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) collection for clinical gene therapy applications. However, the quantities of plerixafor-mobilized CD34+ cells vary between different SCD patients for unknown reasons. Twenty-three participants with SCD underwent plerixafor mobilization followed by apheresis, processing, and HSC enrichment under a phase 1 safety and efficacy study conducted at 2 institutions. Linear regression or Spearman's correlation test was used to assess the relationships between various hematologic and clinical parameters with total CD34+ cells/kg collected. Median CD34+ cells/kg after 2 or fewer mobilization and apheresis cycles was 4.0 x 106 (range, 1.5-12.0). Similar to what is observed generally, CD34+ yield correlated negatively with age (P < .001) and positively with baseline (P = .003) and preapheresis blood CD34+ cells/microL (P < .001), and baseline white blood cell (P = .01) and platelet counts (P = .03). Uniquely for SCD, CD34+ cell yields correlated positively with the number of days hydroxyurea was held (for up to 5 weeks, P = .01) and negatively with markers of disease severity, including hospitalization frequency within the preceding year (P = .01) and the number of medications taken for chronic pain (P = .002). Unique SCD-specific technical challenges in apheresis were also associated with reduced CD34+ cell collection efficiency and purification. Here, we describe factors that impact plerixafor mobilization success in patients with SCD, confirming known factors as described in other populations in addition to reporting previously unknown disease specific factors in patients with SCD. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT03226691.
37883315	Longer length peripheral catheters in sickle cell treatment: a more efficient and cost-effective care pathway.	Patients with sickle cell disease require frequent venous access for red blood cell exchange transfusions to manage their condition. Such frequent access can lead to scar tissue formation, increased pain on insertion, and difficult vascular access for the patients. Previous attempts at achieving successful venous access for patients with difficult venous access has been made with central venous lines, usually femoral lines, which required a large amount of nursing input and resulted in anxiety and pain on insertion for patients. In this article, the author reports on a new pathway with a longer-length peripheral intravenous catheter that reduces the nursing time burden during line insertion, requires less equipment and, crucially, results in a less painful procedure for patients. The increased efficiency of the pathway resulted in a cost saving of $149 per insertion, and patient feedback revealed that the longer-length catheter was preferred over femoral lines.
36508693	Laser therapy for retinopathy in sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) includes a group of inherited haemoglobinopathies affecting multiple organs including the eyes. Some people with SCD develop ocular manifestations. Vision-threatening complications are mainly due to proliferative sickle retinopathy, which is characterised by proliferation of new blood vessels. Laser photocoagulation is widely applicable in proliferative retinopathies. It is important to evaluate the efficacy and safety of laser photocoagulation in the treatment of proliferative sickle retinopathy (PSR) to prevent sight-threatening complications. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of various techniques of laser photocoagulation therapy in SCD-related proliferative retinopathy. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. Date of last search: 4 July 2022. We also searched the following resources (26 June 2022): Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Literature Database (LILACS); WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platforms (ICTRP); and ClinicalTrials.gov. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials comparing laser photocoagulation to no treatment in children and adults with SCD. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed eligibility and risk of bias of the included trials; we extracted and analysed data, contacting trial authors for additional information. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE criteria. MAIN RESULTS: We included three trials (414 eyes of 339 children and adults) comparing the efficacy and safety of laser photocoagulation to no therapy in people with PSR. There were 160 males and 179 females ranging in age from 13 to 67 years. The trials used different laser photocoagulation techniques; one single-centre trial employed sectoral scatter laser photocoagulation using an argon laser; a two-centre trial employed feeder vessel coagulation using argon laser in one centre and xenon arc in the second centre; while a third trial employed focal scatter laser photocoagulation using argon laser. The mean follow-up periods were 21 to 32 months in one trial, 42 to 47 months in a second, and 48 months in the third. Two trials had a high risk of allocation bias due to the randomisation method for participants with bilateral disease; the third trial had an unclear risk of selection bias. One trial was at risk of reporting bias. Given the unit of analysis is the eye rather than the individual, we chose to report the data narratively. Using sectoral scatter laser photocoagulation, one trial (174 eyes) reported no difference between groups for complete regression of PSR: 30.2% in the laser group and 22.4% in the control group. The same trial also reported no difference between groups in the development of new PSR: 34.3% of lasered eyes and 41.3% of control eyes (very low-certainty evidence). The two-centre trial using feeder vessel coagulation, only presented data at follow-up for one centre (mean period of nine years) and reported the development of new sea fan in 48.0% in the treated and 45.0% in the control group; no statistical significance (P = 0.64). A third trial reported regression in 55% of the laser group versus 28.6% of controls and progression of PSR in 10.5% of treated versus 25.7% of control eyes. We graded the evidence for these two primary outcomes as very low-certainty evidence. The sectoral scatter laser photocoagulation trial reported visual loss in 3.0% of treated eyes (mean follow-up 47 months) versus 12.0% of controlled eyes (mean follow-up 42 months) (P = 0.019). The feeder vessel coagulation trial reported visual loss in 1.14% of the laser group and 7.5% of the control group (mean follow-up 26 months at one site and 32 months in another) (P = 0.07). The focal scatter laser photocoagulation trial (mean follow-up of four years) reported that 72/73 eyes had the same visual acuity, while visual loss was seen in only one eye from the control group. We graded the certainty of the evidence as very low. The sectoral scatter laser trial detected vitreous haemorrhage in 12.0% of the laser group and 25.3% of control with a mean follow-up of 42 (control) to 47 months (treated) (P <= 0.5). The two-centre feeder vessel coagulation trial observed vitreous haemorrhage in 3.4% treated eyes (mean follow-up 26 months) versus 27.5% control eyes (mean follow-up 32 months); one centre (mean follow-up nine years) reported vitreous haemorrhage in 1/25 eyes (4.0%) in the treatment group and 9/20 eyes (45.0%) in the control group (P = 0.002). The scatter laser photocoagulation trial reported that vitreous haemorrhage was not seen in the treated group compared to 6/35 (17.1%) eyes in the control group and appeared only in the grades B and (PSR) stage III) (P < 0.05). We graded evidence for this outcome as low-certainty. Regarding adverse effects, only one occurrence of retinal tear was reported. All three trials reported on retinal detachment, with no significance across the treatment and control groups (low-certainty evidence). One trial reported on choroidal neovascularization, with treatment with xenon arc found to be associated with a significantly higher risk, but visual loss related to this complication is uncommon with long-term follow-up of three years or more. The included trials did not report on other adverse effects or quality of life. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Our conclusions are based on the data from three trials (two of which were conducted over 30 years ago). Given the limited evidence available, which we assessed to be of low- or very low-certainty, we are uncertain whether laser therapy for sickle cell retinopathy improves the outcomes measured in this review. This treatment does not appear to have an effect on clinical outcomes such as regression of PSR and development of new incidences. No evidence is available assessing efficacy in relation to patient-important outcomes (such as quality of life or the loss of a driving licence).  Further research is needed to examine the safety of laser treatment compared to other interventions such as intravitreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) . Patient-important outcomes as well as cost-effectiveness should be addressed.
31742587	Beneficial effects of endurance exercise training on skeletal muscle microvasculature in sickle cell disease patients.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic hemoglobinopathy leading to 2 major clinical manifestations: severe chronic hemolytic anemia and iterative vaso-occlusive crises. SCD is also accompanied by profound muscle microvascular remodeling. The beneficial effects of endurance training on microvasculature are widely known. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of an endurance training program on microvasculature of skeletal muscle in SCD patients. A biopsy of the vastus lateralis muscle and submaximal incremental exercise was performed before and after the training period. Of the 40 randomized SCD patients, complete data sets from 32 patients were obtained. The training group (n = 15) followed a personalized moderate-intensity endurance training program, while the nontraining (n = 17) group maintained a normal lifestyle. Training consisted of three 40-minute cycle ergometer exercise sessions per week for 8 weeks. Histological analysis highlighted microvascular benefits in the training SCD patients compared with nontraining patients, including increases in capillary density (P = .003), number of capillaries around a fiber (P = .015), and functional exchange surface (P < .0001). Conversely, no significant between-group difference was found in the morphology of capillaries. Indexes of physical ability also improved in the training patients. The moderate-intensity endurance exercise training program improved the muscle capillary network and partly reversed the microvascular defects commonly observed in skeletal muscle of SCD patients. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT02571088.
36115765	Under the hood: The molecular biology driving gene therapy for the treatment of sickle cell disease.	Gene therapy will soon become the dominant modality for treating of sickle cell disease (SCD). Currently, three technologies are the most promising: expression of transgenic globin genes via a lentiviral vector, controlled mutation of the beta-globin control cluster by transgenic CRISPR-based ribonucleoprotein, and suppression of BCL11a mRNA by shRNA. In this review, we discuss the mechanism of each technology and how they correct the SCD pathology at the molecular level. We conclude by discussing potential directions future therapy may take.
35590440	A rapid evidence assessment of sickle cell disease educational interventions.	AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of educational interventions on the knowledge and attitude of healthcare professionals (HCPs) regarding sickle cell disease (SCD) pain management in the UK. BACKGROUND: Variations and inadequate pain management due toHCPs' lack of knowledge and negative attitude is still an ongoing global concern for SCD patients despite availability of effective treatment and evidence-based guidelines. Several international studies have implemented interventions aimed at improving knowledge, attitude, and pain management. No review on the effectiveness of these interventions was found. Also, no previous intervention done in the UK was found from the thorough search of research databases. However, there are estimated 240,000 genetic carriers with about 12,500-15,000 estimated people living with SCD in the UK. DESIGN: Rapid Evidence Assessment of existing evidence. METHODS: A rapid evidence assessment was conducted between March 2021-January 2022 following the PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Included papers must have an educational intervention about SCD or related symptom management where the learners were HCPs. Excluded papers were those not published in English or before 2010. The following databases were searched: CINAHL, MEDLINE, PubMed America and Europe, Scopus, PsycINFO and Web of Science. Data quality was assessed using the Mixed Methods Assessment Tool (MMAT) and analysed using a narrative approach. RESULTS: Ten studies were included in the final review. Overall, they reported improved outcomes in six main themes: knowledge, attitude, perception, adoption, satisfaction and efficiency. Five studies reported statistically significant improvement in at least one outcome, four studies reported positive improvement, and two studies reported no significant improvement in knowledge and attitude. These heterogeneous studies were implemented once, and all designs were prone to bias; this makes it difficult to state how effective interventions are for SCD. CONCLUSION: Current evidence of positive improvement in HCPs' knowledge and attitude is insufficient for generalisation and recommendation for adoption. However, we believe that implementing validated educational interventions remains essential for effective acute SCD pain management and patient-centred care. Further research is needed to find a suitable educational intervention that can be replicated. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Quality SCD education, timely crisis management and reduced patient stigma are crucial in reducing the risk of rapid clinical decompensation to avoid developing life-threatening complications. Understanding SCD can also support the building of therapeutic relationships between the patient and practitioner. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This review was not registered.

34474658	Co-existing sickle cell anaemia and inflammatory bowel disease: case report and review of the literature.	Sickle cell anaemia (SCA) is a chronic haemolytic anaemia associated with vaso-occlusive painful crises which may affect several systems including the gastro-intestinal system, resulting in abdominal pain. The concurrence of inflammatory bowel disease and haemoglobinopathy is rare. No previously reported concurrent cases of both SCA and ulcerative colitis (UC) in sub-Saharan Africa were found in the literature. A 16-year-old girl with concurrent SCA and UC is presented. She was admitted to University College Hospital, Ibadan with a 1-year history of recurrent peri-umbilical pain and bloody stools. These symptoms were mainly attributed to SCA at the referring hospital, and she was managed for chronic tropical diarrhoea without a remarkable clinical response. This case illustrates the concurrent presentation of SCA and ulcerative colitis which led to the missed and delayed diagnosis of ulcerative colitis.
34537158	Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine Special Statement: Beyond the scalpel: in utero fetal gene therapy and curative medicine.	With the recent advances in gene editing with systems such as CRISPR-Cas9, precise genome editing in utero is on the horizon. Sickle cell disease is an excellent candidate for in utero fetal gene therapy, because the disease is monogenic, causes irreversible harm, and has life-limiting morbidity. Gene therapy has recently been proven to be effective in an adolescent patient. Several hurdles still impede the progress for fetal gene therapy in humans, including an incomplete understanding of the fetal immune system, unclear maternal immune responses to in utero gene therapy, risks of off-target effects from gene editing, gestational age constraints, and ethical questions surrounding fetal genetic intervention. However, none of these barriers appears insurmountable, and the journey to in utero gene therapy for sickle cell disease and other conditions should be well underway.
37743224	Effects of prophylactic red blood cell (RBC) transfusion with extended antigen matching on alloimmunization in patients with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD).	BACKGROUND: RBC alloimmunization remains a significant problem for many patients with SCD. To reduce alloimmunization some strategies have been implemented to provide limited or extended antigen matched RBC transfusions to patients with SCD who need chronic transfusion support. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of prophylactic RBC transfusion with extended antigen matching on alloimmunization in patients with SCD. METHODS: This is a 20-year retrospective study of patients with SCD transfused with RBCS that were prospectively matched for D, C, c, E, e, K, Fya/Fyb, Jka/Jkb and S antigens. Our study included 95 patients, and none had antibodies documented before their first transfusion. Patients and donors were phenotyped and molecular typing was performed in all patients who had recent transfusions or a positive direct antiglobulin test to predict their antigen profile. Unexpected antibodies to the Rh system, meaning anti-Rh antibodies in patients whose serologic phenotype was Rh positive, were investigated by molecular genotyping for RH variant alleles. RESULTS: During this study-period, 12 (12.6%) were alloimmunized and 83 (87.4%) were not. Among the 12 patients who alloimmunized, 7 (58.3%) developed antibodies to Rh antigens and 5 (41.7%) produced antibodies to low prevalence antigens. All patients who developed Rh antibodies had RH variant alleles. Autoantibodies were found in 16 (16.8%) transfused patients. CONCLUSION: SCD patients benefit from receiving prophylactic RBC transfusions with extended antigen matching, as demonstrated by the reduction on the rates of alloimmunization and the lack of antibodies to K, FY, JK and S antigens, however, this strategy does not avoid alloimmunization to Rh and low-prevalence antigens.
33554579	Optimal timing to screen for asymptomatic bacteriuria during pregnancy: first vs. second trimester.	OBJECTIVES: Although current guidelines advice to screen for asymptomatic bacteriuria during pregnancy, little is known about the best moment of testing. The goal of this study is to analyze the optimal timing (first vs. second trimester) to screen for asymptomatic bacteriuria during pregnancy. METHODS: A retrospective cohort analysis, comparing patients that were screened for asymptomatic bacteriuria in the first vs. second trimester was performed. The main question was to compare the rate of positive urinary culture in both trimesters. Study included patients all followed a prenatal consultation at the University Hospital of Brussels between 2012 and 2017. Other outcomes considered were the nature of identified germs, treatments, possible risk and confounding factors (age, BMI, gravidity-parity-abortus [GPA], type of conception, ethnicity, education, prior urinary tract infection (UTI), diabetes, hypertension, prior preterm delivery and sickle cell disease) and complications (UTI, preterm delivery, preterm rupture of the membranes and chorio-amnionitis). RESULTS: A total of 2,005 consecutive files were reviewed, 655 concerned patients screened during the first trimester group and 1,350 in the second trimester group. Asymptomatic bacteriuria was present in only 71 cases (3.54%), 23 in the first trimester group (3.50%) and 48 in the second trimester group (3.55%). Escherichia coli was the most frequently identified germ (37 cases (1.8%), 14 in the first trimester group and 23 in the second trimester group). Our logistic regression analysis shows no statistical difference according to the moment the urinary culture was done for the presence of asymptomatic bacteriuria (E. coli or others), for its association with hospitalization for pyelonephritis, preterm contractions, preterm pre-labor rupture of the membranes (PPROM) and/or preterm delivery. CONCLUSIONS: If recommendations remain to screen for asymptomatic bacteriuria at least once during pregnancy, this study indicates that the moment of testing (first vs. second trimester) has no clinical impact on obstetrical outcomes.
38693059	Survival of transfused red blood cells from a donor with alpha-thalassemia trait in a recipient with sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Post-transfusion survival of donor red blood cells (RBCs) is important for effective chronic transfusion therapy in conditions including sickle cell disease (SCD). Biotin labeling RBCs allows direct in vivo measurement of multiple donor RBC units simultaneously post-transfusion. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In an observational trial of patients with SCD receiving monthly chronic transfusion therapy, aliquots of RBCs from one transfusion episode were biotin-labeled and infused along with the unlabeled RBC units. Serial blood samples were obtained to measure RBC survival. Donor units were tested for RBC indices, hemoglobin fractionation, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) enzyme activity. For microcytic donor RBCs (MCV < 70 fL), HBA1 and HBA2 genetic testing was performed on whole blood. RESULTS: We present one recipient, a pediatric patient with SCD and splenectomy who received two RBC units with aliquots from each unit labeled at distinct biotin densities (2 and 18 mug/mL biotin). One donor unit was identified to have microcytosis (MCV 68.5 fL after biotinylation); whole blood sample obtained at a subsequent donation showed 2-gene deletion alpha-thalassemia trait (alpha-3.7kb/alpha-3.7kb) and normal serum ferritin. G6PD activity was >60% of normal mean for both. The RBCs with alpha-thalassemia RBC had accelerated clearance and increased surface phosphatidylserine post-transfusion, as compared with the normocytic RBC (half life 65 vs. 86 days, respectively). DISCUSSION: Post-transfusion RBC survival may be lower for units from donors with alpha-thalassemia trait, although the impact of thalassemia trait donors on transfusion efficacy requires further study.
37074146	Epidemiological and clinical features, therapeutic strategies and outcomes in patients with hyperhaemolysis: A systematic review.	Hyperhaemolysis syndrome (HHS), a severe form of delayed haemolytic transfusion reaction most commonly described in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), involves destruction of both donor and recipient red blood cells (RBCs). As the epidemiology and underlying pathophysiology have yet to be definitively elucidated, recognition can be challenging. We systematically reviewed PubMed and EMBASE to identify all cases of post-transfusion hyperhaemolysis and characterized the epidemiological, clinical and immunohaematological characteristics and treatments of HHS. We identified 51 patients (33 females and 18 males), including 31 patients with SCD (HbSS, HbSC and HbS/beta-thalassaemia). The median haemoglobin nadir (3.9 g/dL) occurred a median of 10 days post-transfusion. 32.6% and 45.7% of patients had a negative indirect anti-globulin test and a negative direct anti-globulin test, respectively. The most common therapies included corticosteroids and intravenous immune globulin. 66.0% of patients received >=1 supportive transfusion, which was associated with a longer median hospital stay/time to recovery (23 days vs. 15 days; p = 0.015) compared to no supportive transfusion. These findings illustrate that HHS that often results in marked anaemia 10 days post-transfusion is not restricted to patients with haemoglobinopathies, and additional transfused RBCs may be associated with a longer time-to-recovery.
37277324	A multimodal pain protocol for treatment of vaso-occlusive crisis in patients with sickle cell disease: Implementation and evaluation.	OBJECTIVES: Pain management during a vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) remains a major challenge and strongly depends on opioids. We developed a multimodality pain protocol for rapid, opioid-sparing pain treatment of VOC and evaluated its feasibility. METHODS: Patients were included for evaluation if they were >=18 years, diagnosed with SCD and visited the emergency department (ED) because of VOC between July 2018 and December 2020. Primary evaluation outcome was the feasibility of multimodal pain analgesia (i.e., the use of at least two analgesics with different underlying mechanisms of action). RESULTS: A total of 131 SCD patients visited the ED because of VOC with a total of 550 ED presentations, of which 377 were eventually hospitalised. A total of 508 (92.4%) ED presentations and 374 (99.2%) hospital admissions received multimodal pain treatment. Time to first administration of an opioid was median [IQR] 34.0 [21.0-62.0] minutes. CONCLUSION: The implementation of a pain protocol using multimodal analgesia for VOC in patients with SCD appeared to be feasible and facilitated rapid administration of opioids. Controlled trials are needed to investigate the effectiveness of multimodal analgesia on pain and should focus on patient reported outcome measures.
34535466	Risk prediction of covid-19 related death and hospital admission in adults after covid-19 vaccination: national prospective cohort study.	OBJECTIVES: To derive and validate risk prediction algorithms to estimate the risk of covid-19 related mortality and hospital admission in UK adults after one or two doses of covid-19 vaccination. DESIGN: Prospective, population based cohort study using the QResearch database linked to data on covid-19 vaccination, SARS-CoV-2 results, hospital admissions, systemic anticancer treatment, radiotherapy, and the national death and cancer registries. SETTINGS: Adults aged 19-100 years with one or two doses of covid-19 vaccination between 8 December 2020 and 15 June 2021. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was covid-19 related death. Secondary outcome was covid-19 related hospital admission. Outcomes were assessed from 14 days after each vaccination dose. Models were fitted in the derivation cohort to derive risk equations using a range of predictor variables. Performance was evaluated in a separate validation cohort of general practices. RESULTS: Of 6 952 440 vaccinated patients in the derivation cohort, 5 150 310 (74.1%) had two vaccine doses. Of 2031 covid-19 deaths and 1929 covid-19 hospital admissions, 81 deaths (4.0%) and 71 admissions (3.7%) occurred 14 days or more after the second vaccine dose. The risk algorithms included age, sex, ethnic origin, deprivation, body mass index, a range of comorbidities, and SARS-CoV-2 infection rate. Incidence of covid-19 mortality increased with age and deprivation, male sex, and Indian and Pakistani ethnic origin. Cause specific hazard ratios were highest for patients with Down's syndrome (12.7-fold increase), kidney transplantation (8.1-fold), sickle cell disease (7.7-fold), care home residency (4.1-fold), chemotherapy (4.3-fold), HIV/AIDS (3.3-fold), liver cirrhosis (3.0-fold), neurological conditions (2.6-fold), recent bone marrow transplantation or a solid organ transplantation ever (2.5-fold), dementia (2.2-fold), and Parkinson's disease (2.2-fold). Other conditions with increased risk (ranging from 1.2-fold to 2.0-fold increases) included chronic kidney disease, blood cancer, epilepsy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary heart disease, stroke, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, thromboembolism, peripheral vascular disease, and type 2 diabetes. A similar pattern of associations was seen for covid-19 related hospital admissions. No evidence indicated that associations differed after the second dose, although absolute risks were reduced. The risk algorithm explained 74.1% (95% confidence interval 71.1% to 77.0%) of the variation in time to covid-19 death in the validation cohort. Discrimination was high, with a D statistic of 3.46 (95% confidence interval 3.19 to 3.73) and C statistic of 92.5. Performance was similar after each vaccine dose. In the top 5% of patients with the highest predicted covid-19 mortality risk, sensitivity for identifying covid-19 deaths within 70 days was 78.7%. CONCLUSION: This population based risk algorithm performed well showing high levels of discrimination for identifying those patients at highest risk of covid-19 related death and hospital admission after vaccination.
33749705	Gene Therapy for Sickle Cell Disease-A Debt to Be Paid.	
36775201	Multicenter Long-Term Follow-Up of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation with Omidubicel: A Pooled Analysis of Five Prospective Clinical Trials.	Omidubicel is an umbilical cord blood (UCB)-derived ex vivo-expanded cellular therapy product that has demonstrated faster engraftment and fewer infections compared with unmanipulated UCB in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. Although the early benefits of omidubicel have been established, long-term outcomes remain unknown. We report on a planned pooled analysis of 5 multicenter clinical trials including 105 patients with hematologic malignancies or sickle cell hemoglobinopathy who underwent omidubicel transplantation at 26 academic transplantation centers worldwide. With a median follow-up of 22 months (range, .3 to 122 months), the 3-year estimated overall survival and disease-free survival were 62.5% and 54.0%, respectively. With up to 10 years of follow-up, omidubicel showed durable trilineage hematopoiesis. Serial quantitative assessments of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD19+, CD116+CD56+, and CD123+ immune subsets revealed median counts remaining within normal ranges through up to 8 years of follow-up. Secondary graft failure occurred in 5 patients (5%) in the first year, with no late cases reported. One case of donor-derived myeloid neoplasm was reported at 40 months post-transplantation. This was also observed in a control arm patient who received only unmanipulated UCB. Overall, omidubicel demonstrated stable trilineage hematopoiesis, immune competence, and graft durability in extended follow-up.
32501930	The Heterogeneity of Pediatric Knee Infections: A Retrospective Analysis.	BACKGROUND: Musculoskeletal infection is a major cause of morbidity in the pediatric population. Despite the canonical teaching that an irritable joint and signs of infection likely represent an infected joint space, recent evidence in the pediatric hip has demonstrated that alternative diagnoses are equally or more likely and that combinations of pathologies are common. The knee is the second most commonly infected joint in children, yet there remains a paucity of available data regarding the epidemiology and workup of the infected pediatric knee. The authors hypothesize that there is heterogeneity of pathologies, including combinations of pathologies, that presents as a potentially infected knee in a child. The authors aim to show the utility of magnetic resonance imaging and epidemiologic and laboratory markers in the workup of these patients. METHODS: A retrospective review of all consults made to the pediatric orthopaedic surgery team at a single tertiary care center from September 2009 through December 2015 regarding a concern for potential knee infection was performed. Excluded from the study were patients with penetrating trauma, postoperative infection, open fracture, no C-reactive protein (CRP) within 24 hours of admission, sickle cell disease, an immunocompromised state, or chronic osteomyelitis. RESULTS: A total of 120 patients were analyzed in this study. There was marked variability in pathologies. Patients with isolated osteomyelitis or osteomyelitis+septic arthritis were older, had an increased admission CRP, were more likely to be infected with Staphylococcus aureus, required an increased duration of antibiotics, and had an increased incidence of musculoskeletal complications than patients with isolated septic arthritis. CONCLUSIONS: When considering a child with an irritable knee, a heterogeneity of potential underlying pathologies and combinations of pathologies are possible. Importantly, the age of the patient and CRP can guide a clinician when considering further workup. Older patients with a higher admission CRP value warrant an immediate magnetic resonance imaging, as they are likely to have osteomyelitis, which was associated with worse outcomes when compared with patients with isolated septic arthritis. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III-retrospective research study.
33331032	A case of hyperhaemolysis syndrome in a pregnant Chinese woman with beta-thalassemia during perinatal transfusion.	OBJECTIVES: To report a case of hyperhaemolysis syndrome (HHS) that occurred during perinatal blood transfusion in a pregnant Chinese woman with beta-thalassemia to deepen the understanding of HHS and the risk of transfusion therapy for patients with thalassemia. BACKGROUND: Most HHS cases occur in people with sickle cell disease. So far, no cases of HHS have been reported in the Chinese population. Here, we report a pregnant Chinese women with beta-thalassemia experiencing HHS. METHODS: The patient received ABO- and RhD-matched red blood cell transfusion from six blood donors in four perinatal transfusions. Haemoglobinuria and lower haemoglobin levels compared to those before transfusion were observed after each transfusion, and the lactate dehydrogenase was consistently elevated. The blood samples were collected at different time points during the hospitalisation for direct antiglobulin test (DAT), antibody screening test and acid elution test. The antigens of six blood donors were identified, and the cross-matching tests were repeated using the blood sample of the patient with specific irregular antibodies after the last transfusion. RESULTS: The DAT of the patient was negative for anti-IgG and positive (1+) for anti-C3d, and no red blood cell antibodies were detected in the eluent before, between and after transfusions. Before and between transfusions, blood samples were negative for red blood cell irregular antibodies, whereas IgM anti-P1 and IgG anti-Jka were detected in blood samples the next day after the last transfusion. In the six donors, two were negative for P1 and Jka , one was positive for P1 and negative for Jka , and three were negative for P1 and positive for Jka . The tentative cross-matching tests using the indirect antiglobulin method in saline showed that only agglutination occurred in the blood samples of the patient collected after last transfusion and the three Jka -positive blood donors. DISCUSSION: The clinical manifestations and laboratory test results suggested that HHS occurred in this patient with beta-thalassemia after each transfusion. Clinicians should be aware that HHS can occur with compatible blood transfusion.
32928460	Association of Antibiotic Choice With Hospital Length of Stay and Risk Factors for Readmission in Patients With Sickle Cell Disease and Acute Chest Syndrome: An Observational Cohort Study.	STUDY OBJECTIVE: We determine the association between use of specific cephalosporins and macrolides and hospital length of stay in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) who are admitted with acute chest syndrome, and determine treatment risk factors for acute chest syndrome-related 30-day readmission. METHODS: Patients admitted to 48 US hospitals within the Pediatric Health Information System between January 2008 and December 2016 with associated International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) or ICD-10 diagnoses of SCD and acute chest syndrome were included. Primary outcomes were hospital length of stay and acute chest syndrome-related and all-cause 30-day readmission. Data were analyzed with t tests, ANOVA, and bivariable and multivariable linear and logistic regressions. RESULTS: In 21,126 visits (representing 8,856 patients), median age was 11.2 years (interquartile range 6.1 to 16.5 years), 53.5% were male patients, and 77.2% had hemoglobin SS genotype. Median length of stay was 4 days (interquartile range 2 to 6 days; mean 4.76 days [SD 4.62 days]). Ceftriaxone alone (length of stay 4.75 days [SD 4.66 days]; P<.001) or the combination of ceftriaxone and azithromycin (length of stay 4.84 days [SD 4.74 days]; P<.001) was associated with the shortest length of stay and a reduced risk of acute chest syndrome-related readmission (ceftriaxone odds ratio [OR] 0.31; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.27 to 0.35; ceftriaxone+azithromycin OR 0.20; 95% CI 0.17 to 0.24). Albuterol (OR 0.97; 95% CI 0.96 to 0.98) and RBC transfusion (OR 0.60; 95% CI 0.43 to 0.83) were also associated with decreased rates of acute chest syndrome-related 30-day readmission. All-cause 30-day readmission rate was 16.7% (95% CI 16.2% to 17.3%). CONCLUSION: Guideline-compliant therapy for acute chest syndrome could preferentially include ceftriaxone and azithromycin. All-cause 30-day readmission for acute chest syndrome is lower than that reported for all-cause readmissions for SCD and more consistent with rates of readmission for pneumonia in the general population.
37002797	Variant RHD alleles and Rh immunization in patients with sickle cell disease.	RH diversity among patients and donors contributes to Rh immunization despite serologic Rh-matched red cell transfusions. Anti-D can occur in D+ patients with RHD variants that encode partial D antigens. Anti-D has also been reported in patients with conventional RHD transfused primarily with units from Black donors who frequently have variant RHD. We report 48 anti-D in 690 D+ transfused individuals with sickle cell disease, categorized here as expressing conventional D, partial D or D antigen encoded by RHD*DAU0. Anti-D formed in a greater proportion of individuals with partial D, occurred after fewer D+ unit exposures, and remained detectable for longer than for those in the other categories. Among all anti-D, 13 had clinical or laboratory evidence of poor transfused red cell survival. Most individuals with anti-D were chronically transfused, including 32 with conventional RHD who required an average of 62 D- units/year following anti-D. Our findings suggest that patients with partial D may benefit from prophylactic D- or RH genotype-matched transfusions to prevent anti-D. Future studies should investigate whether RH genotype-matched transfusions can improve use of valuable donations from Black donors, reduce D immunization and minimize transfusion of D- units to D+ individuals with conventional RHD or DAU0 alleles.
32403100	Chronic Pain Does Not Impact Baseline Circulating Cytokine Levels in Adults with Sickle Cell Disease.	Chronic pain affects 50% of adults with sickle cell disease (SCD). Although inflammation is thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic pain, no studies have examined the differences in circulating cytokines between patients with SCD with and without chronic pain. We performed an observational cohort study using blood and urine samples from adults with SCD with and without chronic pain at their usual state of health. We tested the hypothesis that, compared to those without chronic pain, those with chronic pain would have significantly higher baseline circulating proinflammatory cytokines. A total of 61 adults with SCD, 40 with chronic pain and 21 without chronic pain were tested. When SCD patients with chronic pain were compared to those without chronic pain, no significant differences in cytokine levels were noted. The variables most associated with the diagnosis of chronic pain in this population were opioid dose and subject age.
36031725	Neurocognitive functioning in children with sickle cell anemia and history of abnormal transcranial doppler ultrasonography.	BACKGROUND: Transcranial doppler (TCD) ultrasonography can be used to identify stroke risk in children with sickle cell anemia. Previous studies have reported mixed findings on neurocognitive outcomes in children with elevated TCD. This study examined associations between TCD velocity and neurocognitive outcomes in children and adolescents without prior history of stroke. PROCEDURE: Participants were selected from the Sickle Cell Clinical Research Intervention Program cohort. The highest recorded mean maximum TCD velocity was selected for analysis, along with participant's most recent data from serial neurocognitive surveillance. RESULTS: A total of 200 children with sickle cell anemia completed neurocognitive testing (109 males, 91 females; mean age 12.7 years [SD = 3.56]). Most participants were prescribed hydroxyurea (72%) at the time of neurocognitive testing and nearly 16% had a history of chronic transfusions prior to neurocognitive evaluation. Mean age at time of highest TCD value was 6.6 years (SD = 2.5) and 13.5% of screenings were abnormal (>=200 cm/s). Mean interval between TCD and most recent neurocognitive evaluation was 6.1 years (+-3.5). There were no significant differences in the interval between TCD and neurocognitive testing across normal, conditional, and abnormal groups. Maximum TCD velocity was not significantly associated with neurocognitive outcomes in multivariate models. CONCLUSIONS: History of elevated TCD in the absence of overt stroke should not be considered a risk factor for poor neurocognitive outcomes in children and adolescents with sickle cell anemia on modern disease-modifying therapy.
32202248	Alternative donor: alphass/CD19 T-cell-depleted haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for sickle cell disease.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited disorder; despite significant improvements in supportive care, SCD continues to cause substantial morbidity, mortality, and reduced life expectancy. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is currently the only widely available curative therapy for SCD, which is offered as a standard of care for patients with a matched sibling donor (MSD). Donor availability is limited to a minority of patients. Thus, alphabeta/CD3-depleted haploidentical HSCT, as an efficient means for depletion of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD)-mediating T cells, can be offered as an alternative curative therapy, particularly for nonmalignant diseases such as SCD. Out of 38 patients with advanced stage SCD, 25 were transplanted with CD3/CD19- or T-cell receptor alphabeta/CD19 T-cell-depleted peripheral stem cell grafts (T-haplo-HSCT group), whereas 13 transplanted from MSD (MSD group); both groups received an almost identical conditioning regimen. Engraftment was achieved in all. However, in the T-haplo-HSCT group, three patients succumbed to an uncontrolled cytomegalovirus pneumonitis, a macrophage activation syndrome, and a major blood group incompatibility with a late graft failure and multiorgan failure. The overall survival was 88% and 100% in T-haplo-HSCT and MSD groups, respectively. None of our patients developed a Glucksberg Grade III-IV acute GvHD. Four patients (16%) in the T-haplo-HSCT group and two patients (15%) in the MSD group developed a steroid-sensitive, mild-to-moderate chronic GvHD that resolved within 18 months posttransplant. These results are encouraging and demonstrate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of T-haplo-HSCT in advanced stage SCD in children and adults, thus offering a curative alternative to majority of patients.
34889404	Management of hemolytic transfusion reactions.	Delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions (DHTRs) in patients with sickle cell disease are underappreciated and potentially fatal. Patients with DHTRs typically have symptoms of pain or dark urine days to weeks following a red blood cell (RBC) transfusion. In instances of DHTRs with hyperhemolysis, the patient's hemoglobin (Hgb) may be significantly lower than it was pretransfusion, and the Hgb A may drop by more than 50%. In most cases, at least 1 RBC alloantibody and sometimes multiple RBC alloantibodies can be identified during the DHTR, with those antibodies presumably having fallen below the level of detection at the time of the implicated transfusion. However, in up to one-third of cases, no new RBC alloantibodies can be identified posttransfusion. Complement is increasingly being appreciated to play a role in DHTRs and hyperhemolysis, not only due to classic pathway activation (with complement fixed antibody bound to RBCs) but also due to alternative pathway activation (resulting in part from plasma free heme). As such, anti-C5 inhibition has recently been reported to be effective at mitigating hemolysis in the setting of some severe DHTRs. Transfusion avoidance during DHTRs is recommended if possible, with long-term transfusion support advice being less clear; for example, a history of a severe DHTR may lead to questions regarding the safety of transfusions prior to curative therapies such as stem cell transplantation or gene therapy. A better understanding of antibody-positive and antibody-negative DHTRs, including patient- or disease-specific risk factors, is necessary to improve transfusion safety.
37417197	Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of an oral formulation of decitabine and tetrahydrouridine.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is caused by an inherited structural abnormality of adult hemoglobin causing polymerization. Fetal hemoglobin interferes with polymerization but is epigenetically silenced by DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) in adult erythropoiesis. Decitabine depletes DNMT1 and increases fetal and total hemoglobin in SCD patients, but is rapidly catabolized by cytidine deaminase (CDA) in vivo. Tetrahydrouridine (THU) inhibits CDA, safeguarding decitabine. METHODS: The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of three oral combination formulations of THU and decitabine, with different coatings producing different delays in decitabine release, were investigated in healthy participants. RESULTS: Tetrahydrouridine and decitabine were rapidly absorbed into the systemic circulation after a single combination oral dose, with relative bioavailability of decitabine >=74% in fasted males compared with separate oral administration of THU followed by decitabine 1 h later. THU and decitabine Cmax and area under the plasma concentration versus time curve were higher in females versus males, and fasted versus fed states. Despite sex and food effect on pharmacokinetics, the pharmacodynamic effect of DNMT1 downregulation was comparable in males and females and fasted and fed states. Treatments were well tolerated. CONCLUSION: Combination oral formulations of THU with decitabine produced pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics suitable for oral DNMT1-targeted therapy.
36400544	The Evolving Landscape of Drug Therapies for Sickle Cell Disease.	Although sickle cell disease can be cured using allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and possibly gene therapy and gene editing, these treatments remain unavailable to most patients. As understanding of the disease pathophysiology increases, progress is being made in developing drug therapies. Hydroxyurea, l-glutamine, crizanlizumab, and voxelotor are currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, with multiple others at various stages of testing. With the limited efficacy of individual agents, combinations of agents will likely be required for optimal outcomes. Clinical and surrogate endpoints, other than vaso-occlusive crisis, are increasingly being considered in the evaluation of novel drugs.
37996648	Motixafortide: First Approval.	Motixafortide (APHEXDATM) is a selective C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) inhibitor being developed by BioLineRx under licence from Biokine Therapeutics for the mobilization of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and the treatment of various cancers. On 11 September 2023, motixafortide was approved in the USA for use in combination with filgrastim [granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF)] to mobilize HSCs to the peripheral blood for collection and subsequent autologous transplantation in patients with multiple myeloma. Motixafortide has been granted Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of pancreatic cancer in the EU and the USA, and for the treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia in the USA. Clinical development is ongoing for the mobilization of CD34+ HSCs for gene therapy in patients with sickle cell disease. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of motixafortide leading to this first approval.
31796035	Utilization patterns of malaria chemoprophylaxis among Tanzanian children attending sickle cell clinic in Dar es Salaam tertiary hospitals.	BACKGROUND: Malaria is among the leading cause of infection in individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD) living in sub-Saharan Africa, including Tanzania. However, after 2005 the standard treatment guidelines (STGs) on malaria chemoprevention for SCD patients were non-existent, and at present no medicine is recommended for SCD patients. Since several anti-malarials have been approved for the treatment of malaria in Tanzania, it is important to establish if there is a continued use of chemoprevention against malaria among SCD children. METHODS: A cross-sectional, hospital-based study was conducted between January and June 2019 at tertiary hospitals in Dar es Salaam. Data were collected using a semi-questionnaire and analysed using SPSS software version 25. The descriptive statistics were summarized using proportions, while factors associated with the use of chemoprophylaxis were analysed using multivariate logistic regression. Statistical significance of p < 0.05 was accepted. RESULTS: A total of 270 SCD children were involved. The median age of SCD children was 6 years (interquartile range (IQR): 3-11 years). Of 270 SCD children, 77% (number (n) = 218) of children with SCD had not been diagnosed with malaria in the previous year, whereas 12.6% (n = 34) of children were admitted because of malaria in the previous year. Regarding the use of chemoprophylaxis in SCD children, 32.6% (n = 88) of parents were aware that, chemoprophylaxis against malaria is recommended in SCD children. Of the 270 participants, 17% (n = 46) were using malaria chemoprophylaxis. A majority used artemisinin combination therapy (ACT), 56.8% (n = 26). Of 223 parents who did not give chemoprophylaxis, the majority (n = 142, 63.7%) indicated unavailability at clinics as the reason. Children whose parents were primary level educated were 9.9 times more likely to not use chemoprophylaxis (adjusted odds ratio (AOR); 9.9, 95% CI 1.8-56.5, P = 0.01) compared to those whose parents had tertiary education. CONCLUSION: Despite the lack of STGs, a small proportion of children with SCD were using malaria chemoprophylaxis where the majority used ACT, i.e., dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine.
33050763	Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation in Patients with Hemoglobinopathies.	Hemoglobinopathies are the most common single-gene diseases and are estimated to affect millions of people worldwide. Thalassemia and sickle cell disease are the most prevalent diseases of this group. Today, despite the decreasing number of newborns diagnosed with a hemoglobinopathy, it remains an important health problem for many countries. Although regular red blood cell (RBC) transfusions, advanced iron chelation, and supportive therapy alternatives have improved life expectancy, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative option for patients with hemoglobinopathies to prevent irreversible organ damage. Modern transplantation approaches and careful posttransplantation follow-up of patients have improved survival outcomes, and HSCT has now been performed in several patients with hemoglobinopathies worldwide. Considering current experiences, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is recommended in cases of beta-thalassemia (beta-thal) in the presence of a matched family or unrelated donor, without secondary organ damage due to transfusion. In patients with sickle cell anemia, transplantation indications include transfusion dependence and cases of secondary organ damage. Recently, gene therapy as a possible treatment option has yielded promising results, though it is not in routine clinical use at its current stage.
31809007	Sickle cell disease: current treatment and emerging therapies.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is among the most common genetic diseases in the United States, affecting approximately 100,000 people. In the United States, SCD is characterized by a shortened life expectancy of only about 50 years in severe subtypes, significant quality-of-life impairments, and increased healthcare utilization and spending. SCD is characterized by chronic hemolytic anemia, vaso-occlusion, and progressive vascular injury affecting multiple organ systems. The pathophysiology is directly related to polymerization of deoxygenated hemoglobin, leading to a cascade of pathologic events including erythrocyte sickling, vaso-occlusion, tissue ischemia, and reperfusion injury as well as hemolysis, abnormal activation of inflammatory and oxidative pathways, endothelial dysfunction, increased oxidative stress, and activation of coagulation pathways. These multifactorial abnormalities have both acute and chronic clinical consequences across multiple organ systems, including acute pain episodes, chronic pain syndromes, acute chest syndrome, anemia, stroke and silent cerebral infarcts, cognitive dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension, and a wide range of other clinical consequences. Hydroxyurea was the only approved treatment for SCD for nearly 2 decades; in 2017, L-glutamine oral powder was approved for the prevention of the acute complications of SCD. During the last several years there has been a dramatic increase in research into treatments that address distinct elements of SCD pathophysiology and even new curative approaches that provide new hope to patients and physicians for a clinically consequential disease that has long been neglected.
32220342	Paediatric to adult transition care for patients with sickle cell disease: a global perspective.	Sickle cell disease is a life-threatening inherited condition designated as a public health priority by WHO. Increased longevity of patients with sickle cell disease in high-income, middle-income, and low-income countries present unprecedented challenges for all settings; however, a globally standardised solution for patient transition from paediatric to adult sickle cell disease health care is unlikely to address the challenges. We established a task force of experts from a multicountry (the USA, Europe, Middle East, and Africa) consortium. We combined themes from the literature with viewpoints from members of the task force and invited experts to provide a global overview of transition care practice, highlighting barriers to effective transition care and provide baseline recommendations that can be adapted to local needs. We highlighted priorities to consider for any young person with sickle cell disease transitioning from paediatric to adult health care: skills transfer, increasing self-efficacy, coordination, knowledge transfer, linking to adult services, and evaluating readiness (the SICKLE recommendations). These recommendations aim to ensure appropriate benchmarking of transition programming, but multisite prospective studies are needed to address this growing public health need.
34488784	Combining malaria vaccination with chemoprevention: a promising new approach to malaria control.	Malaria control has stalled in a number of African countries and novel approaches to malaria control are needed for these areas. The encouraging results of a recent trial conducted in young children in Burkina Faso and Mali in which a combination of the RTS,S/AS01E malaria vaccine and seasonal malaria chemoprevention led to a substantial reduction in clinical cases of malaria, severe malaria, and malaria deaths compared with the administration of either intervention given alone suggests that there may be other epidemiological/clinical situations in which a combination of malaria vaccination and chemoprevention could be beneficial. Some of these potential opportunities are considered in this paper. These include combining vaccination with intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in infants, with intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy (through vaccination of women of child-bearing age before or during pregnancy), or with post-discharge malaria chemoprevention in the management of children recently admitted to hospital with severe anaemia. Other potential uses of the combination are prevention of malaria in children at particular risk from the adverse effects of clinical malaria, such as those with sickle cell disease, and during the final stages of a malaria elimination programme when vaccination could be combined with repeated rounds of mass drug administration. The combination of a pre-erythrocytic stage malaria vaccine with an effective chemopreventive regimen could make a valuable contribution to malaria control and elimination in a variety of clinical or epidemiological situations, and the potential of this approach to malaria control needs to be explored.
33471938	Sickle cell disease: progress towards combination drug therapy.	Dr. John Herrick described the first clinical case of sickle cell anaemia (SCA) in the United States in 1910. Subsequently, four decades later, Ingram and colleagues characterized the A to T substitution in DNA producing the GAG to GTG codon and replacement of glutamic acid with valine in the sixth position of the betaS -globin chain. The establishment of Comprehensive Sickle Cell Centers in the United States in the 1970s was an important milestone in the development of treatment strategies and describing the natural history of sickle cell disease (SCD) comprised of genotypes including homozygous haemoglobin SS (HbSS), HbSbeta0 thalassaemia, HbSC and HbSbeta+ thalassaemia, among others. Early drug studies demonstrating effective treatments of HbSS and HbSbeta0 thalassaemia, stimulated clinical trials to develop disease-specific therapies to induce fetal haemoglobin due to its ability to block HbS polymerization. Subsequently, hydroxycarbamide proved efficacious in adults with SCA and was Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved in 1998. After two decades of hydroxycarbamide use for SCD, there continues to be limited clinical acceptance of this chemotherapy drug, providing the impetus for investigators and pharmaceutical companies to develop non-chemotherapy agents. Investigative efforts to determine the role of events downstream of deoxy-HbS polymerization, such as endothelial cell activation, cellular adhesion, chronic inflammation, intravascular haemolysis and nitric oxide scavenging, have expanded drug targets which reverse the pathophysiology of SCD. After two decades of slow progress in the field, since 2018 three new drugs were FDA-approved for SCA, but research efforts to develop treatments continue. Currently over 30 treatment intervention trials are in progress to investigate a wide range of agents acting by complementary mechanisms, providing the rationale for ushering in the age of effective and safe combination drug therapy for SCD. Parallel efforts to develop curative therapies using haematopoietic stem cell transplant and gene therapy provide individuals with SCD multiple treatment options. We will discuss progress made towards drug development and potential combination drug therapy for SCD with the standard of care hydroxycarbamide.
34078644	Trends in Technology Assistance Among Patients With Childhood Onset Chronic Conditions.	OBJECTIVE: To describe the prevalence, types, and trends over time of medical technology assistance (TA) in patients at the age of transition to adult care with childhood onset chronic conditions (COCCs) cared for at children's hospitals. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this retrospective repeated annual cross-sectional cohort study of the Pediatric Health Information Systems inpatient data, patients with at least 1 hospitalization from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2018 with a selected COCC were included. The COCCs investigated were brain and spinal cord malformation, cerebral palsy, heart and great vessel malformation, cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, and chronic renal failure. TA was defined as requiring an indwelling medical device to maintain health status. Trends over time in TA were analyzed with the Cochran-Armitage test and generalized linear models. RESULTS: During the study, 381 289 unique patients accounted for 940 816 hospitalizations. Transition-aged patients (19-21 years old) represented 2.4% of all included hospitalizations over the 11-year period, whereas patients ages 21 and above represented 2.7%. The annual proportion of patients with TA increased significantly from 31.3% in 2008 to 36.9% in 2018, a 17.9% increase (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of patients with select COCCs hospitalized at children's hospitals, a substantial and growing number of patients at the age of transition to adult care required TA. Identifying adult providers with resources to manage COCCs and maintain medical devices placed in childhood is challenging. These trends warrant special attention to support the timely and successful transition of medically complex patients from pediatric to adult care.
36752670	An outpatient pain plan and ED pain pathway for adults with sickle cell disease.	ABSTRACT: Sickle cell disease (SCD), one of the most common inherited diseases, is associated with lifetime morbidity and reduced life expectancy. In the United States, SCD primarily affects Black patients and, to a lesser degree, those of Hispanic descent. These populations are known to have healthcare disparities related to lower socioeconomic status, limited access to healthcare, and racial bias. The quality-adjusted life expectancy of patients with SCD is less than 35 years, because of progressive complications of the disease. The most common complication is severe episodic pain related to vaso-occlusive ischemic events. Despite guidelines, pain management often is delayed as patients struggle with resistance from clinicians based on concerns over opioid use or abuse, overdose, or drug-seeking behavior. Effective pain management can be accomplished with collaboration between clinicians and patients, a documented outpatient pain management plan, and when necessary, an ED clinical pain pathway for acute SCD pain management.

34287597	Contraception and reproductive planning from the perspective of women with sickle cell disease.	OBJECTIVE: To understand the perceptions of women with sickle cell disease (SCD) about reproductive planning in a public health service. METHOD: This is a qualitative study conducted with 15 women with SCD attended at a public hospital in Recife, between August 2018 and May 2019. Bardin's content analysis technique was used. RESULTS: The women were between 25 and 38 years old, married, and had low education. After the analysis, four thematic categories emerged: information about contraception, use of contraceptive methods, feelings about pregnancy, and gynecological consultation. It was found that women with SCD are influenced by factors such as fear of complications during pregnancy, lack of information on reproductive planning, partners and health professional opinion, and difficulties in health service access. FINAL CONSIDERATIONS: The reports demonstrate that health workers need to improve the way through which information reaches the patient, to offer a more satisfactory professional practice.
31804727	Prevalence of serologic markers of transfusion and sexually transmitted infections and their correlation with clinical features in a large cohort of Brazilian patients with sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) often require red blood cell (RBC) transfusion for clinical complications, so may be exposed to transfusion-transmitted infections (TTIs). The prevalence of markers for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and B (HBV), human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV-1/2), Chagas disease, and syphilis in an SCD cohort in Brazil were studied. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Clinical history, interview data, blood samples, and medical chart review data were collected during cohort enrollment from November 2013 to May 2015. Serologic markers of infection were assessed. Standard measures of statistical association were calculated, and multivariable models were developed for the most prevalent infections to identify associated factors. RESULTS: Infection markers were evident in 5.2% (144/2779) of the enrolled cohort. Anti-HCV was detected in 69 (2.5%), syphilis antibodies in 34 (1.2%), anti-HTLV-1/2 in 17 (0.6%), HBV surface antigen in 13 (0.5%), Chagas disease antibodies in 13 (0.5%), and anti-HIV in 8 (0.3%) of participants. Factors associated with increased odds of being anti-HCV reactive were older age, illegal drug use, increasing number of RBCs, more than three pain crises in the previous year, and geographic location. Syphilis was associated with older age, females, and smoking history. CONCLUSION: HCV infection was more common in older patients who may have received RBCs before testing was performed on donations, suggesting possible historic transfusion transmission. The cohort showed decreasing rates of infections and a reduction in transfusion transmission markers in younger patients compared to historical literature except for syphilis, indicating contemporary reduced risk of TTI.
35995392	Comparison of Anti-Mullerian Hormone Levels Pre- and Post-Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation in Pediatric and Adolescent Females with Sickle Cell Disease.	Allogeneic hematopoietic cell therapy (HCT) is an established cure for sickle cell disease (SCD); however, HCT conditioning regimens are known to be gonadotoxic. Anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) measures ovarian reserve, and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) defines premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) at values >40 mIU/mL in pubertal females. The present study was conducted to assess ovarian reserve and function before and after transplantation in pediatric and adolescent females with SCD treated with allogeneic HCT between January 2015 and June 2020 at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta. In this retrospective review of 17 females age <21 years with SCD who had AMH levels measured at baseline and at 2 years post-HCT, AMH levels were categorized as normal, low, or undetectable, and FSH levels were measured and used to identify pubertal females who had developed POI. Demographic and treatment data were abstracted from the institutional database and medical records, and a descriptive statistical analysis was conducted. Of the 17 patients in the study cohort, 14 had been treated with hydroxyurea and 3 had chronic transfusions but with no significant iron overload. AMH levels were normal in 15 patients (88%) and low in 2 patients (12%) at baseline. The median age at HCT was 7.5 years (range, 3.7 to 20.3 years), and 14 patients (82%) underwent matched related donor HCT. After HCT, 15 patients (88%) had undetectable AMH and 2 (12%) had low AMH, with no apparent differences by HCT conditioning regimen. No pubertal patients had POI at baseline, whereas 55% of pubertal patients had progressed to POI by 2 years post-HCT. In this cohort, the majority of females had normal AMH levels at baseline but undetectable levels after HCT. Females with SCD considering HCT should be counseled about the treatment-related risk of gonadal dysfunction.   2022 American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.

35320302	Perspectives of individuals with sickle cell disease on barriers to care.	INTRODUCTION: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited hemoglobinopathy that predominantly affects African Americans in the United States. The disease is associated with complications leading to high healthcare utilization rates, including emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations. Optimal SCD care requires a multidisciplinary approach involving SCD specialists to ensure preventive care, minimize complications and prevent unnecessary ED visits and hospitalizations. However, most individuals with SCD receive sub-optimal care or are unaffiliated with care (have not seen an SCD specialist). We aimed to identify barriers to care from the perspective of individuals with SCD in a multi-state sample. METHODS: We performed a multiple methods study consisting of surveys and interviews in three comprehensive SCD centers from March to June 2018. Interviews were transcribed and coded, exploring themes around barriers to care. Survey questions on the specific themes identified in the interviews were analyzed using summary statistics. RESULTS: We administered surveys to 208 individuals and conducted 44 in-depth interviews. Barriers to care were identified and classified according to ecological level (i.e., individual, family/interpersonal, provider, and socio-environmental/organizational level). Individual-level barriers included lack of knowledge in self-management and disease severity. Family/interpersonal level barriers were inadequate caregiver support and competing life demands. Provider level barriers were limited provider knowledge, provider inexperience, poor provider-patient relationship, being treated differently, and the provider's lack of appreciation of the patient's SCD knowledge. Socio-environmental/organizational level barriers included limited transportation, lack of insurance, administrative barriers, poor care coordination, and reduced access to care due to limited clinic availability, services provided or clinic refusal to provide SCD care. CONCLUSION: Participants reported several multilevel barriers to SCD care. Strategies tailored towards reducing these barriers are warranted. Our findings may also inform interventions aiming to locate and link unaffiliated individuals to care.
33034160	The burden of respiratory syncytial virus infections among children with sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Although respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of pediatric lower respiratory tract infections, the burden of RSV in children with sickle cell disease (SCD) is unknown. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, nested, case-control study of children with SCD <18 years who had respiratory viral panels (RVPs) performed at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta from 2012 to 2019. We abstracted the medical records to describe the demographics, clinical features, and outcomes of children who tested positive for RSV (cases) versus children who tested negative (controls). We calculated the annual incidence of RSV and related hospitalization rates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and used multivariate logistic regression to evaluate associations. RESULTS: We identified 3676 RVP tests performed on 2636 patients over seven respiratory seasons resulting in 219/3676 (6.0%) RSV-positive tests among 160/2636 (6.1%) patients. The average annual incidence of laboratory-confirmed RSV infection among children with SCD was 34.3 (95% CI 18.7-49.8) and 3.8 (95% CI 0.5-7.0) cases per 1000 person-years for those <5 years and 5-18 years, respectively. The RSV-related hospitalization rate for children <5 years was 20.7 (95% CI 8.5-32.8) per 1000 person-years. RSV-positive cases were significantly younger than RSV-negative patients (3.8 years vs 7.6 years, P < .001). Of RSV-positive cases, 22 (13.8%) developed acute chest syndrome and nine (5.6%) required intensive care, which was not significantly different from RSV-negative children with SCD. CONCLUSION: RSV infections are common in children with SCD with higher burden in younger patients. RSV is associated with considerable morbidity, including higher rates of hospitalization compared to the general population.
34537420	Haploidentical Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation in Sickle Cell Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.	Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT) is the sole established curative treatment option for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). However, a lack of HLA-identical sibling donors is a limiting factor. Haploidentical related donors are a promising donor pool, potentially extending SCT as a curative treatment option to a larger group of patients with no other meaningful treatment options for their severe SCD. In the present study, we aimed to systematically review the results of haploidentical SCT in patients with SCD. A comprehensive search was performed in MEDLINE/PubMed and Embase up to May 2021. Data were extracted by 2 reviewers independently, and the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale was used to assess the quality of the studies. Fourteen studies met our inclusion criteria. To provide an overview of the results of haploidentical SCT, we grouped the studies into myeloablative conditioning versus nonmyeloablative conditioning as well as into in vitro versus in vivo (ie, with post-transplantation cyclophosphamide) T cell depletion with a subgroup meta-analysis of proportions. All the included studies were observational cohort studies. Only 3 of these studies reported data for both matched sibling donor (MSD) SCT and haploidentical SCT. Based on a comparative meta-analysis of the 3 studies that included both haploidentical and MSD transplantation, graft failure was significantly higher in the haploidentical group than in the MSD group (odds ratio, 5.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0 to 27.6). Overall survival was not significantly different between the groups. A subgroup meta-analysis of the results of haploidentical SCT showed relatively low overall pooled proportions of graft failure (7%; 95% CI, 2% to 20%), acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (4%; 95% CI, 2% to 12%), and chronic GVHD (11%; 95% CI, 7% to 16%). Overall survival (OS) was high in all the included studies (91%; 95% CI, 85% to 94%). Adjustments to the conditioning regimens, robust pretransplantation and post-transplantation T cell depletion, and improved supportive care have resulted in reduced graft failure and improved OS following haploidentical SCT in patients with SCD. We conclude that the safety of haploidentical SCT in SCD patients has improved significantly, and that this should be considered as a curative option in patients with severe SCD.
36058780	Acute and chronic pain management in patients with sickle cell disease in the modern era: a comprehensive review.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common inherited red blood cell (RBC) disorder worldwide, resulting in chronic hemolytic anemia, vaso-occlusion, tissue hypoxia, and ultimately end organ damage. The hallmark of the disease is manifested by vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) resulting in acute on chronic pain, and the most common cause for presentation to the emergency department and hospital admission. The management of pain for patients with SCD in the U.S. has historically been socially and politically complex with most patients experiencing pain on a daily basis but not seeking immediate medical attention. The pathophysiology of acute and chronic pain in SCD is multifactorial and complex. Here, we describe factors contributing to acute and chronic pain in SCD and management strategies.
35302009	Long-term Survival after Hematopoietic Cell Transplant for Sickle Cell Disease Compared to the United States Population.	Hematopoietic cell transplant for sickle cell disease is curative but is associated with life threatening complications most of which occur within the first 2 years after transplantation. In the current era with interest in gene therapy and gene editing we felt it timely to report on sickle cell disease transplant recipients who were alive for at least 2-year after transplantation, not previously reported. Our objectives were to (1) report the conditional survival rates of patients who were alive for 2 or more years after transplantation (2) identify risk factors for death beyond 2 years after transplantation and (3) compare all-cause mortality risks to those of an age-, sex- and race-matched general population in the United States. By limiting to 2-year survivors, we exclude deaths that occur as a direct consequence of the transplantation procedure. De-identified records of 1149 patients were reviewed from a publicly available data source and 950 patients were eligible (https://picsure.biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov). All analyses were performed in this secure cloud environment using the available statistical software package(s). The validity of the public database was confirmed by reproducing results from an earlier publication. Conditional survival estimates were obtained using the Kaplan-Meier method for the sub-cohort that had survived a given length (x) of time after transplantation. Cox regression models were built to identify risk factors associated with mortality beyond 2 years after transplantation. The standardized relative mortality risk (SMR) or the ratio of observed to expected number of deaths, was used to quantify all-cause mortality risk after transplantation and compared to age, race and sex-matched general population. Person-years at risk were calculated from an anchor date (i.e., 2-, 5- and 7-years) after transplantation until date of death or last date known alive. The expected number of deaths was calculated using age, race and sex-specific US mortality rates. The median follow up was 5 years (range 2-20) and 300 (32%) patients were observed for more than 7 years. Among those who lived for at least 7 years after transplantation the 12-year probability of survival was 97% (95% CI, 92%-99%). Compared to an age-, race- and sex-matched US population, the risk for late death after transplantation was higher as late as 7 years after transplantation (hazard ratio (HR) 3.2; P= .020) but the risk receded over time. Risk factors for late death included age at transplant and donor type. For every 10-year increment in patient age, an older patient was 1.75 times more likely to die than a younger patient (P= .0004). Compared to HLA-matched siblings the use of other donors was associated with higher risk for late death (HR 3.49; P= .003). Graft failure (beyond 2-years after transplantation) was 7% (95% CI, 5%-9%) and graft failure was higher after transplantation of grafts from donors who were not HLA-matched siblings (HR 2.59, P< .0001). Long-term survival after transplantation is excellent and support this treatment as a cure for sickle cell disease. The expected risk for death recedes over time but the risk for late death is not negligible.
34227124	Early initiation of hydroxyurea (hydroxycarbamide) using individualised, pharmacokinetics-guided dosing can produce sustained and nearly pancellular expression of fetal haemoglobin in children with sickle cell anaemia.	Hydroxyurea (hydroxycarbamide) is an effective treatment for sickle cell anaemia (SCA), but clinical responses depend primarily upon the degree of fetal haemoglobin (HbF) induction and the heterogeneity of HbF expression across erythrocytes. The number and characteristics of HbF-containing cells (F-cells) are not assessed by traditional HbF measurements. Conventional hydroxyurea dosing (e.g. fixed doses or low starting doses with stepwise escalation) produces a moderate heterocellular HbF induction, but haemolysis and clinical complications continue. Robust, pancellular HbF induction is needed to minimise or fully inhibit polymerisation of sickle haemoglobin. We treated children with hydroxyurea using an individualised, pharmacokinetics-guided regimen starting at predicted maximum tolerated dose (MTD). We observed sustained HbF induction (mean >30%) for up to 6 years, which was not dependent on genetic determinants of HbF expression. Nearly 70% of patients had >=80% F-cells (near-pancellular), and almost half had >=90% F-cells (pancellular). The mean HbF/F-cell content was ~12 pg. Earlier age of initiation and better medication adherence were associated with high F-cell responses. In summary, early initiation of hydroxyurea using pharmacokinetics-guided starting doses at predicted MTD can achieve sustained near-pancellular or pancellular HbF expression and should be considered an achievable goal for children with SCA treated with hydroxyurea at optimal doses. Clinical trial registration number: NCT02286154 (clinicaltrials.gov).
37653351	Kidney failure outcomes in children and young adults with sickle cell disease in the United States Renal Data System.	BACKGROUND: Children and young adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) develop kidney disease early in childhood, with some patients progressing to require dialysis and kidney transplantation. The prevalence and outcomes of children with kidney failure (chronic kidney disease stage 5) due to SCD are not well described. This study aimed to assess the outcome of children and young adults with SCD with kidney failure compared to matched children and young adults without SCD with kidney failure in a large national database. METHODS: Utilizing the United States Renal Data System (USRDS), we retrospectively examined kidney failure outcomes in children and young adults with SCD from 1998 to 2019. RESULTS: We identified 97 patients with SCD who developed kidney failure and identified 96 matched controls with a median age of 19 years (IQR 17, 21) at the time of kidney failure diagnosis. SCD patients had significantly shorter survival (8.4 years vs. 14.0 years, p < 0.001) and had a longer waiting time for their first transplant when compared to matched non-SCD kidney failure patients (12.1 years vs. 7.3 years, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Children and young adults with SCD kidney failure have significantly higher mortality when matched to non-SCD kidney failure children and experience a longer mean time to kidney transplant.
34043152	Sickle cell disease related chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension: challenging clinical scenario.	Sickle cell disease (SCD), a haemoglobinopathy characterized by chronic haemolysis with acute exacerbations and vascular occlusion episodes, may be complicated by pulmonary hypertension. The latter may be caused by chronic thromboembolic disease of pulmonary artery branches and its management is not well-defined. Herein, we present a case of SCD complicated by chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension of subsegmental pulmonary artery branches successfully treated with endothelin receptor antagonists, orally administered prostacyclin analogs and balloon pulmonary angioplasty. This challenging case highlights the need for clinical awareness of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension as a specific and potentially curable form of pulmonary hypertension complicating SCD course that may necessitate combined pharmacologic and interventional management.
36860093	Attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccine among pediatric patients with sickle cell disease and their caregivers.	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate attitudes toward vaccination and vaccine uptake regarding coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among pediatric patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and their caregivers. PROCEDURE: Adolescent patients and caregivers of children with SCD were surveyed during routine clinic visits; we then conducted a logistic regression analysis to understand differences in vaccine status, while qualitative responses were coded thematically. RESULTS: Among respondents, the overall vaccination rate among adolescents and caregivers was 49% and 52%, respectively. Among the unvaccinated, 60% and 68% of adolescents and caregivers, respectively, preferred to remain unvaccinated, most commonly due to lack of perceived personal benefit from vaccination or mistrust in the vaccine. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that child's age (odds ratio [OR] = 1.1, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.0-1.2, p < .01) and caregiver education (measured by the Economic Hardship Index [EHI] score, OR = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.74-0.78, p < .05) were independent predictors of getting vaccinated. CONCLUSION: Despite the increased risk of severe illness due to COVID-19 in patients with SCD, vaccine hesitancy remains high in this population of families whose children have SCD. Fortunately, the reasons cited for deferring vaccination among those who are unvaccinated were largely due to barriers that may be overcome with quality communication around the utility of the vaccine and information about vaccine safety.
35731941	Transition for Adolescents and Young Adults With Sickle Cell Disease in a US Midwest Urban Center: A Multilevel Perspective on Barriers, Facilitators, and Future Directions.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD), an inherited red blood cell disorder, primarily affects African Americans in the United States. Adolescents and young adults with SCD (AYA-SCD) are at risk of high morbidity and mortality when transitioning from pediatric to adult care. The goal of this qualitative study was to understand factors associated with optimal implementation of the AYA-SCD transition. METHODS: Participants were recruited from a large hospital system and the community. Interview guides included topics on access to primary and specialized care, beliefs and practices related to pain control, transition from pediatric to adult care, and patient experiences in the emergency department. Data were coded and analyzed using an inductive thematic coding approach in combination with a deductive coding approach using domains from the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). RESULTS: Fifty-nine participants, including 21 AYA-SCD from both the pediatric and adult clinics, 17 caregivers, 9 pediatric SCD providers, 6 adult SCD providers, and 6 emergency department providers, completed 11 focus groups and 5 semistructured interviews. Results identified multiple factors within the domains of CFIR including the outer setting, inner setting, individual characteristics, and intervention characteristics. Results were incorporated into a transition framework to inform local practice improvement. CONCLUSION: Our study highlights the importance of multilevel barriers and facilitators for AYA-SCD transition from pediatric to adult care. Future studies could use implementation science frameworks to understand local context and identify strategies and intervention characteristics to improve transition programming. These efforts will ultimately reduce health disparities and ensure health equity.
33127654	Sensitive manipulation of CAR T cell activity using a chimeric endocytosing receptor.	BACKGROUND: Most adoptive cell therapies (ACTs) suffer from an inability to control the therapeutic cell's behavior following its transplantation into a patient. Thus, efforts to inhibit, activate, differentiate or terminate an ACT after patient reinfusion can be futile, because the required drug adversely affects other cells in the patient. METHODS: We describe here a two domain fusion receptor composed of a ligand-binding domain linked to a recycling domain that allows constitutive internalization and trafficking of the fusion receptor back to the cell surface. Because the ligand-binding domain is designed to bind a ligand not normally present in humans, any drug conjugated to this ligand will bind and endocytose selectively into the ACT. RESULTS: In two embodiments of our strategy, we fuse the chronically endocytosing domain of human folate receptor alpha to either a murine scFv that binds fluorescein or human FK506 binding protein that binds FK506, thereby creating a fusion receptor composed of largely human components. We then create the ligand-targeted drug by conjugating any desired drug to either fluorescein or FK506, thereby generating a ligand-drug conjugate with ~10-9 M affinity for its fusion receptor. Using these tools, we demonstrate that CAR T cell activities can be sensitively tuned down or turned off in vitro as well as tightly controlled following their reinfusion into tumor-bearing mice. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest this 'chimeric endocytosing receptor' can be exploited to manipulate not only CAR T cells but other ACTs following their reinfusion into patients. With efforts to develop ACTs to treat diseases including diabetes, heart failure, osteoarthritis, cancer and sickle cell anemia accelerating, we argue an ability to manipulate ACT activities postinfusion will be important.
34251034	Low rates of transfusion-transmitted infection screening in chronically transfused adults with sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) on chronic transfusion therapy are exposed to a large volume of blood products, thus increasing their risk of transfusion-associated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C (HCV), and hepatitis B (HBV). METHODS: We performed a systematic chart review of chronically transfused SCD subjects at the Johns Hopkins Sickle Cell Center for Adults between October 2014 and September 2019 to determine our Center's adherence to the 2014 National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) SCD guidelines for annual screening for Transfusion Transmitted infections (TTI) and assessed HBV immunity and HBV vaccination rates. RESULTS: The study included 85 subjects with a median age of 34 years (23-63); 52% were female. No subject received annual screening; 68 subjects (80%) were screened for HIV, 60 subjects (71%) for HCV and 53 subjects (62%) for HBV infections at least once in the study period. Of those screened, one patient was newly diagnosed with HCV infection, and none with HIV or HBV infection. Among 31 subjects tested for anti-Hepatitis B surface antibody, 16 subjects (52%) tested negative. Nineteen (20%) subjects had HBV vaccination documented. CONCLUSIONS: Low adherence to the NHLBI TTI screening guidelines, especially for HBV, highlights the resource intensiveness of this patient population. The low rates of anti-Hepatitis B surface antibody positivity highlight the need to confirm vaccination, provide boosters as indicated, and investigate the adults with SCD's immune response to HBV vaccination.
38206762	Managing sickle cell disease and related complications in pregnancy: results of an international Delphi panel.	ABSTRACT: Data to guide evidence-based management of pregnant people with sickle cell disease (SCD) are limited. This international Delphi panel aimed to identify consensus among multidisciplinary experts for SCD management during pregnancy. The 2-round Delphi process used questionnaires exploring 7 topics (antenatal care, hydroxyurea use, transfusion, prevention of complications, treatment of complications, delivery and follow-up, and bottlenecks and knowledge gaps) developed by a steering committee. Thirteen panelists (hematologists, physiologists, obstetricians, maternal fetal medicine, and transfusion medicine physicians) from the United States, the United Kingdom, Turkey, and France completed the first survey; 12 panelists completed the second round. Anonymized responses were collected and summarized by a contract research organization (Akkodis Belgium). Consensus and strong consensus were predefined as 75% to 90% (9-10 of 12) and >90% (>=11 of 12) of panelists, respectively, agreeing or disagreeing on a response to a predefined clinical scenario or statement. In several areas of SCD management, consensus was achieved: experts recommended performing at least monthly multidisciplinary antenatal follow-up, administering prophylactic aspirin for preeclampsia prevention between gestational weeks 12 and 36, initiating prophylactic transfusion therapy in certain cases, or choosing automated red blood cell exchange over other transfusion methods for patients with iron overload or severe acute chest syndrome. No consensus was reached on several topics including the prophylactic aspirin dose, indications for starting infection prophylaxis, routine use of prophylactic transfusions, or use of prophylactic transfusions for preventing fetal complications. These recommendations could inform clinical care for patients with SCD who are pregnant in the absence of large clinical trials involving this population; the identified knowledge gaps can orient future research.
33093353	Complications of Central Venous Access Devices in Patients With Sickle Cell Disease and Thalassemia Major.	Pediatric patients with sickle cell disease and thalassemia major present clinical characteristics that could lead to a higher incidence of central venous access devices-associated complications (CVAD-C). With the objective of analyzing the safety of the use of CVAD in these patients, a retrospective review including all pediatric patients with these pathologies who required the implantation of a CVAD between 2004 and 2019 was performed. In all, 54 patients with 100 CVAD (65 totally implantable venous access port with subcutaneous reservoir, 35 single-lumen or double-lumen partially tunneled catheter) were included. During 60,410 days at risk of suffering a CVAD-C, 55 complications (complication rate [CR]/1000 catheter-days at risk=0.91) were reported in 46 CVAD: 19 mechanicals (CR=0.32), 32 infectious (CR=0.53), and 4 thrombotic complications (CR=0.066). Incidence of mechanical and infectious complications was significantly higher in double-lumen partially tunneled catheter than in totally implantable venous access port with subcutaneous reservoir (P<0.001). Lower age at insertion was related with a higher incidence of any complication (odds ratio=0.88/y, P=0.02). Patients who required a stem cell transplantation (31 patients and 65 CVAD) had no significant higher incidences of CVAD-C. In conclusion, our study supports the safety of using CVAD in these patients, with a low incidence of infectious, thrombotic, and mechanical complications.
33075179	Randomized control trial of oral arginine therapy for children with sickle cell anemia hospitalized for pain in Nigeria.	Low arginine bioavailability is associated with vaso-occlusive painful crisis (VOC) severity in sickle cell anemia (SCA) and predicts need for pediatric hospitalization. Intravenous arginine therapy has opioid-sparing effects and was found to significantly decrease pain scores in children hospitalized with SCA-VOC in a phase-two randomized placebo-controlled trial (RCT). Efficacy of oral arginine is unknown. Our objective was to determine the safety and efficacy of oral arginine therapy in Nigerian children with SCA. A double-blind RCT of oral L-arginine-hydrochloride (100 mg/kg TID) was conducted in children with SCA-VOC, aged 5-17 years, hospitalized at two Nigerian sites. The primary outcome measure was analgesic usage, quantified by difference in the mean Analgesic Medication Quantification Scale (MQS). Secondary outcomes included daily pain scores, time-to-crisis-resolution and length-of-hospital-stay. An intention-to-treat analysis was performed. Sixty-eight children (age 5-17 years, mean 10.6 +- 0.4 years; 56% male), were randomized to receive L-arginine (35 patients) or placebo (33 patients). The mean total MQS for the arginine group was 73.4 (95% CI, 62.4-84.3) vs 120.0 (96.7-143.3) for placebo (P < .001). The mean rate of decline in worst pain scores was faster in the arginine arm vs placebo (1.50 [1.23-1.77] vs 1.09 [0.94-1.24] point/d, P = .009). Children receiving arginine had a shorter time-to-crisis-resolution (P = .02), shorter hospital-stay (P = .002) and experienced no serious adverse event. Pain control was more rapid, total analgesic requirement was significantly reduced, and most notably, time-to-crisis-resolution and length-of-hospital-stay were shorter in children with SCA-VOC receiving arginine vs placebo. Given the established safety and low cost, oral arginine is a promising adjuvant therapy for SCA-VOC management.
32651584	Unrecognized Hemoglobin Variants in the Donor Blood Supply Are Detectable in the Transfused Population.	OBJECTIVES: The US Food and Drug Administration requires donated blood to be tested for various infectious diseases to ensure safety and purity. However, testing for hemoglobin variants is not required, despite reported occurrences of hemoglobin variant transfusion and concerns about the safety of such transfusions. This study aimed to investigate the frequency of hemoglobin variants within the blood supply. METHODS: We performed a 2-part study. First, we tested all RBC units in our blood bank by high-performance liquid chromatography for the presence of hemoglobin variants. Second, we performed a retrospective analysis of hemoglobin variant testing completed for routine management of sickle cell disease patients at our institution over a 5-month period to identify cases of hemoglobin variant transfusion. RESULTS: We found that 2 of 476 (0.4%) RBC units in our blood bank contained a hemoglobin variant, and 5 of 563 (0.9%) sickle cell patients seen at our institution in a 5-month period were transfused with RBCs containing a hemoglobin variant. CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed that hemoglobin variants are present within the blood supply, and the frequency of hemoglobin variant transfusion is elevated for patients with sickle cell disease given the increased prevalence of hemoglobin variants in the population of matched donors.
37147250	The implementation of automated red blood cell exchange (erythrocytapheresis) as a treatment modality in sickle cell disease patients: Single center experience.	BACKGROUND: Improvements of health infrastructure, preventive care and clinical management is important to reduce the morbidity and mortality of sickle cell disease (SCD). OBJECTIVE: This prospective, investigator-initiated non-randomized open-label intervention, single centre study describes the implementation of the automated erythrocytapheresis in low-middle income country as a treatment modality for SCD patients to improve the standard of care and highlights its benefits and challenges. METHODOLOGY: Eligible patients with SCD who had overt stroke, abnormal/conditional transcranial doppler (TCD), or other indications were subjected to regular automated erythrocytapheresis program. RESULTS: From 18th Dec 2017 till 17th Dec 2022, 21 subjects were enrolled; seventeen (80.9 %) were Egyptian and four (19.1 %) were non-Egyptian (three Sudanese and one Nigerian). Totalling 133 sessions had been performed mainly in working hours with fluctuating frequency per month. All sessions maintained isovolumic status and were performed using central venous access. The target HbS concentration was set from the start; the mean final FCR % fraction was 51, most of the session (n = 78, 58.7 %) were able to achieve target FCR. The majority of session pass smoothly with no adverse event (n = 81, 60.9 %), except for certain challenges as shortage of the required blood (n = 38), hypotension (n = 2), hypocalcaemia (n = 2). CONCLUSION: Automated erythrocytapheresis is safe and effective modality for management of patients with sickle cell disease.
38775255	Antioxidant supplementation for sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) refers to a group of genetic disorders characterized by the presence of an abnormal haemoglobin molecule called haemoglobin S (HbS). When subjected to oxidative stress from low oxygen concentrations, HbS molecules form rigid polymers, giving the red cell the typical sickle shape. Antioxidants have been shown to reduce oxidative stress and improve outcomes in other diseases associated with oxidative stress. Therefore, it is important to review and synthesize the available evidence on the effect of antioxidants on the clinical outcomes of people with SCD. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of antioxidant supplementation for improving health outcomes in people with SCD. SEARCH METHODS: We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 15 August 2023. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing antioxidant supplementation to placebo, other antioxidants, or different doses of antioxidants, in people with SCD. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently extracted data, assessed the risk of bias and certainty of the evidence, and reported according to Cochrane methodological procedures. MAIN RESULTS: The review included 1609 participants in 26 studies, with 17 comparisons. We rated 13 studies as having a high risk of bias overall, and 13 studies as having an unclear risk of bias overall due to study limitations. We used GRADE to rate the certainty of evidence. Only eight studies reported on our important outcomes at six months. Vitamin C (1400 mg) plus vitamin E (800 mg) versus placebo Based on evidence from one study in 83 participants, vitamin C (1400 mg) plus vitamin E (800 mg) may not be better than placebo at reducing the frequency of crisis (risk ratio (RR) 1.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64 to 2.18), the severity of pain (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.40 to 4.37), or adverse effects (AE), of which the most common were headache, nausea, fatigue, diarrhoea, and epigastric pain (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.00). Vitamin C plus vitamin E may increase the risk of SCD-related complications (acute chest syndrome: RR 2.66, 95% CI 0.77 to 9.13; 1 study, 83 participants), and increase haemoglobin level (median (interquartile range) 90 (81 to 96) g/L versus 93.5 (84 to 105) g/L) (1 study, 83 participants) compared to placebo. However, the evidence for all the above effects is very uncertain. The study did not report on quality of life (QoL) of participants and their caregivers, nor on frequency of hospitalization. Zinc versus placebo Zinc may not be better than placebo at reducing the frequency of crisis at six months (rate ratio 0.62, 95% CI 0.17 to 2.29; 1 study, 36 participants; low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether zinc is better than placebo at improving sickle cell-related complications (complete healing of leg ulcers at six months: RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.60 to 6.72; 1 study, 34 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Zinc may be better than placebo at increasing haemoglobin level (g/dL) (MD 1.26, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.26; 1 study, 36 participants; low-certainty evidence). The study did not report on severity of pain, QoL, AE, and frequency of hospitalization. N-acetylcysteine versus placebo N-acetylcysteine (NAC) 1200 mg may not be better than placebo at reducing the frequency of crisis in SCD, reported as pain days (rate ratio 0.99 days, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.84; 1 study, 96 participants; low-certainty evidence). Low-certainty evidence from one study (96 participants) suggests NAC (1200 mg) may not be better than placebo at reducing the severity of pain (MD 0.17, 95% CI -0.53 to 0.87). Compared to placebo, NAC (1200 mg) may not be better at improving physical QoL (MD -1.80, 95% CI -5.01 to 1.41) and mental QoL (MD 2.00, 95% CI -1.45 to 5.45; very low-certainty evidence), reducing the risk of adverse effects (gastrointestinal complaints, pruritus, or rash) (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.14; low-certainty evidence), reducing the frequency of hospitalizations (rate ratio 0.98, 95% CI 0.41 to 2.38; low-certainty evidence), and sickle cell-related complications (RR 5.00, 95% CI 0.25 to 101.48; very low-certainty evidence), or increasing haemoglobin level (MD -0.18 g/dL, 95% CI -0.40 to 0.04; low-certainty evidence). L-arginine versus placebo L-arginine may not be better than placebo at reducing the frequency of crisis (monthly pain) (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.95; 1 study, 50 participants; low-certainty evidence). However, L-arginine may be better than placebo at reducing the severity of pain (MD -1.41, 95% CI -1.65 to -1.18; 2 studies, 125 participants; low-certainty evidence). One participant allocated to L-arginine developed hives during infusion of L-arginine, another experienced acute clinical deterioration, and a participant in the placebo group had clinically relevant increases in liver function enzymes. The evidence is very uncertain whether L-arginine is better at reducing the mean number of days in hospital compared to placebo (MD -0.85 days, 95% CI -1.87 to 0.17; 2 studies, 125 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Also, L-arginine may not be better than placebo at increasing haemoglobin level (MD 0.4 g/dL, 95% CI -0.50 to 1.3; 2 studies, 106 participants; low-certainty evidence). No study in this comparison reported on QoL and sickle cell-related complications. Omega-3 versus placebo Very low-certainty evidence shows no evidence of a difference in the risk of adverse effects of omega-3 compared to placebo (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.48; 1 study, 67 participants). Very low-certainty evidence suggests that omega-3 may not be better than placebo at increasing haemoglobin level (MD 0.36 g/L, 95% CI -0.21 to 0.93; 1 study, 67 participants). The study did not report on frequency of crisis, severity of pain, QoL, frequency of hospitalization, and sickle cell-related complications. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There was inconsistent evidence on all outcomes to draw conclusions on the beneficial and harmful effects of antioxidants. However, L-arginine may be better than placebo at reducing the severity of pain at six months, and zinc may be better than placebo at increasing haemoglobin level. We are uncertain whether other antioxidants are beneficial for SCD. Larger studies conducted on each comparison would reduce the current uncertainties.
38753737	Burden and outcome of respiratory morbidities among children and adolescents with sickle cell disease-A retrospective review of emergency presentations in some Nigerian tertiary institutions.	BACKGROUND: Despite the huge burden of sickle cell disease (SCD) among Nigerian children, the burden and outcome of respiratory illnesses remain undocumented. Thus, we aimed to describe the spectrum and outcome of respiratory illnesses among SCD childrenand adolescentadmissions in ten Nigerian tertiary hospitals. METHOD: A retrospective review of the SCD admission records of children and adolescents with a confirmed diagnosis of respiratory illnesses from 2012 to 2021 in ten tertiary health facilities across five geopolitical zones in Nigeria was conducted. The data, collectedbetween March and June 2023, included the age, sex, diagnosis, complications, duration and outcome of hospitalization. RESULTS: Of the 72,333 paediatric admissions, 7,256 (10.0%) had SCD; the proportion of SCD from the total admission ranged from 2.1 to 16.3% in the facilities. Of the 7,256 children and adolescents with SCD, 1,213 (16.7%) had respiratory morbidities. Lower respiratory disease was the most common (70.0%) respiratory entity and the majority were pneumonia (40.1.0%), followed by acute chest syndrome (26.7%). Seventeen (1.4%) patients died; all had lower respiratory diseases [(acute chest syndrome ACS (11, 64.7%), pneumonia; 5, 29.4%, and asthma (1, 5.9%). Based on the proportion of deaths among overall SCD, the 17 death cases contributed 9.4% (95% CI 5.9 to 14.5). Factors associated with deaths included duration of hospitalization less than 72 hours and lower respiratory tract diseases. CONCLUSION: Sickle cell disease is a major contributor to hospitalization among Nigerian children and adolescents, with high respiratory morbidity and mortality. Pneumonia and acute chest syndrome were associated with mortality, andthe highest risk of death within the first 72 hours.

34419981	Core Decompression and Bone Marrow Aspirate Concentrate in the Treatment of Femoral Head Avascular Necrosis in Pediatric Sickle Cell Disease: Can We Improve Natural History?	INTRODUCTION: Femoral head avascular necrosis (AVN) affects between 10% and 41% of children with sickle cell disease (SCD), resulting in the development of proximal femoral deformity and residual hip pain in the majority of patients without treatment. There have been multiple adult studies published on the outcomes of core decompression with and without the use of bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) injection both in idiopathic and SCD-related AVN with promising results, however, few studies have reported on outcomes in skeletally immature patients. PURPOSE: This study sought to report on a single surgeon's outcomes for core decompression with BMAC injection in pediatric patients with AVN of the femoral head secondary to underlying SCD. METHODS: A single-center, retrospective review was performed for pediatric patients undergoing core decompression with BMAC injection for femoral head AVN in patients with SCD with a minimum of 12-month follow-up. Demographic, radiographic, and clinical variable were collected. Patients were subdivided based upon presence of open femoral physes at the time of surgery. Successful treatment was defined as the ability to return to activities without limitations. RESULTS: A total of 13 patients (average age 14.1+-2.8 y, 84.6% male, 6 skeletally immature and 7 skeletally mature) with 18 affected extremities were identified. Open physes were present in 50% of operative extremities. Skeletally immature patient demonstrated reconstitution of the femoral head in 78% of cases and 89% demonstrated regression of at least 1 Steinberg grade and none had progression. Skeletally immature patients were significantly more likely to return to activities (100% vs. 55.6%, P=0.023) and achieve a final Tonnis grade <2 (89% vs. 44%, P=0.046). CONCLUSION: Core decompression appears to alter the natural history of AVN in skeletally immature patients with SCD. Skeletal immaturity was a positive prognostic factor for the ability to return to activities without pain and achieve a lower Tonnis grade at final follow-up.
36413684	Pregnancy and sickle cell disease: an overview of complications and suggested perinatal care.	INTRODUCTION: Pregnancy in women with sickle cell disease (SCD) has been identified as high risk owing to increased incidence of materno-fetal complications across various studies and reports. These complications include consequences related to the underlying hemoglobinopathy; chronic anemia/associated inflammation, and pregnancy related including the risk for thromboembolism, bleeding and maternal mortality. Outcomes of neonates born to women with SCD has been suboptimal over the years with recent improvement due to strict monitoring, preventive and therapeutic measures. Much is yet to be unraveled regarding the optimal management of women with SCD during pregnancy, identifying target hemoglobin, delivery mode or timing among others. AREAS COVERED: This review includes a summary of available data of the maternal and fetal outcomes; in addition to current recommendations for monitoring and management of women with SCD during pregnancy. EXPERT OPINION: To have a successful pregnancy, women should be closely monitored, and interventions provided as needed to guarantee adequate management of anemia, as well as prevention, diagnosis and management of disease. They should also be educated regarding their reproductive health, emphasizing that pregnancy is possible, and achieving optimal results depends on providing adequate care in a health care facility with expertise in high-risk pregnancies and SCD.
31990287	Pathologic angiogenesis in the bone marrow of humanized sickle cell mice is reversed by blood transfusion.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a monogenic red blood cell (RBC) disorder with high morbidity and mortality. Here, we report, for the first time, the impact of SCD on the bone marrow (BM) vascular niche, which is critical for hematopoiesis. In SCD mice, we find a disorganized and structurally abnormal BM vascular network of increased numbers of highly tortuous arterioles occupying the majority of the BM cavity, as well as fragmented sinusoidal vessels filled with aggregates of erythroid and myeloid cells. By in vivo imaging, sickle and control RBCs have significantly slow intravascular flow speeds in sickle cell BM but not in control BM. In sickle cell BM, we find increased reactive oxygen species production in expanded erythroblast populations and elevated levels of HIF-1alpha. The SCD BM exudate exhibits increased levels of proangiogenic growth factors and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1. Transplantation of SCD mouse BM cells into wild-type mice recapitulates the SCD vascular phenotype. Our data provide a model of SCD BM, in which slow RBC flow and vaso-occlusions further diminish local oxygen availability in the physiologic hypoxic BM cavity. These events trigger a milieu that is conducive to aberrant vessel growth. The distorted neovascular network is completely reversed by a 6-week blood transfusion regimen targeting hemoglobin S to <30%, highlighting the plasticity of the vascular niche. A better insight into the BM microenvironments in SCD might provide opportunities to optimize approaches toward efficient and long-term hematopoietic engraftment in the context of curative therapies.
34607344	Economic evaluation of regular transfusions for cerebral infarct recurrence in the Silent Cerebral Infarct Transfusion Trial.	In 2020, the American Society of Hematology published evidence-based guidelines for cerebrovascular disease in individuals with sickle cell anemia (SCA). Although the guidelines were based on National Institutes of Health-sponsored randomized controlled trials, no cost-effectiveness analysis was completed for children with SCA and silent cerebral infarcts. We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing regular blood transfusion vs standard care using SIT (Silent Cerebral Infarct Transfusion) Trial participants. This analysis included a modified societal perspective with direct costs (hospitalization, emergency department visit, transfusion, outpatient care, and iron chelation) and indirect costs (special education). Direct medical costs were estimated from hospitalizations from SIT hospitals and unlinked aggregated hospital and outpatient costs from SIT sites by using the Pediatric Health Information System. Indirect costs were estimated from published literature. Effectiveness was prevention of infarct recurrence. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio using a 3-year time horizon (mean SIT Trial participant follow-up) compared transfusion vs standard care. A total of 196 participants received transfusions (n = 90) or standard care (n = 106), with a mean age of 10.0 years. Annual hospitalization costs were reduced by 54% for transfusions vs standard care ($4929 vs $10 802), but transfusion group outpatient costs added $22 454 to $137 022 per year. Special education cost savings were $2634 over 3 years for every infarct prevented. Transfusion therapy had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $22 025 per infarct prevented. Children with preexisting silent cerebral infarcts receiving blood transfusions had lower hospitalization costs but higher outpatient costs, primarily associated with the oral iron chelator deferasirox. Regular blood transfusion therapy is cost-effective for infarct recurrence in children with SCA. This trial is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00072761.
34851438	First report of successful treatment for hemoglobin Bristol-Alesha by hemopoietic stem cell transplantation.	HBB gene mutations lead to many kinds of diseases, of which, except for the two most common diseases of thalassemia and sickle cell anemia, rare kinds of hemolytic anemia, such as hemoglobin Bristol-Alesha, are rarely reported, no ideal treatment in clinic. A child suffered from chronic recurrent hemolytic attacks and the related genes of hereditary hemolytic anemia were detected on her. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was conducted in the treatment of the patient. The patient was diagnosed as hemoglobin Bristol-Alesha and achieved complete recovery after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. For Bristol-Alesha, without characteristic clinical manifestation and specific biochemical examination, diagnosis is dependent on the gene mutation detection and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is an effective and curable method.
34420880	Alloimmunization in transfused patients with constitutional anemias in Norway.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The status of red blood cell alloimmunization in patients with constitutional anemias including hemoglobinopathies is not known in Norway. The study objective was to investigate the impact of a strategy based on phenotype-matching for C, c, E, e, K, Jka, Jkb, Fya, Fyb, S and s on alloimmunization. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed transfusions of 40 patients retrospectively using the computerized blood bank management system and medical records; including diagnosis, age at start of transfusion therapy, gender, number and age of packed red blood cell units transfused, follow-up time, phenotypes of the donors and patients, antigen-negative patients exposed to antigen-positive packed red blood cell units, transfusion reactions and alloantibody specificities. RESULTS: Forty patients received 5402 packed red blood cell units. Alloimmunization frequency was 20 % for the whole group, being 7%, 25 % and 30 % in patients with sickle cell disease (n = 14), thalassemia (n = 16) and other conditions (n = 10), respectively. The alloantibodies detected were anti-E, -c, -C, -Cw, -K, -Jka and -Lua. CONCLUSION: Good communication between the clinicians and the transfusion services is essential for successful management of patients with constitutional anemias. Providing full phenotype-matched units was not always possible. Extended pheno-/genotyping before the first transfusion and providing antigen-negative units for antigen-negative patients for at least C, c, E and K in every red cell transfusion would probably have reduced the alloimmunization rate. Non-phenotype-matched transfusions seem to be the main reason for alloimmunization. Finding markers for identifying responders prone to alloimmunization will ensure targeted transfusion strategies.
36191963	Patients with sickle cell disease who develop end-stage kidney disease continue to experience poor survival - A 19-year United States Renal Data System study.	
35848827	Urgent use of voxelotor in sickle cell disease when immediate transfusion is not safe.	The use of blood transfusions to improve anemia resulting from sickle cell disease (SCD) is often limited by alloimmunization, which occurs due to exposure to incompatible antigen present on donor red blood cells (RBCs). This complication occasionally manifests as delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions (DHTRs) that cause hemolysis of the recipient's own RBCs and can lead to fatal anemia. In this case study, we report a patient with SCD who experienced a DHTR following chronic transfusion and was successfully treated with voxelotor, an orally administered sickle hemoglobin (HbS) polymerization inhibitor for the treatment of SCD. Laboratory tests following admission indicated pan-reactivity in antigens, and a rare donor registry was used to locate acceptable units. The patient experienced the DHTR 3 days after admission, which limited laboratory tests due to profound hemolysis. Alternative treatments were limited, and phenotypically matched units were incompatible, so voxelotor was selected as a last-resort treatment. Following initiation of voxelotor 1500 mg, the patient's hemoglobin levels returned to baseline (6 g/dl) within 10 days, with clinical improvements. This report provides evidence regarding the use of voxelotor in the treatment of profound anemia where other treatments could be unsafe or unavailable.
34419651	Increased Rates of Rhabdomyolysis in Male Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Recipients Taking Sirolimus and Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole.	Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) offers long-term cure against early morbidity and mortality of hemoglobinopathies, such as sickle cell disease (SCD) and beta-thalassemia. Following HCT, sirolimus is an immunosuppressant used to prevent graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) while receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) for Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis and other antimicrobial agents (including acyclovir). One rare adverse event associated with both drugs is rhabdomyolysis, defined as creatine kinase (CK) elevation at least 5 to 10 times the upper limit of normal. This study was conducted to evaluate the rate of and risk factors for developing rhabdomyolysis in the post-HCT setting. Across 4 haploidentical and matched related donor (MRD) nonmyeloablative protocols, CK levels were prospectively monitored and patients were retrospectively identified for rhabdomyolysis. The rhabdomyolysis was graded based on the severity of CK elevation and other organ injury. At diagnosis, patients were queried for concurrent medication use (ie, sirolimus, TMP-SMX, acyclovir, or statins), sex, age, donor genotype, and time from transplantation. Among 127 patients with mostly SCD, rhabdomyolysis occurred in 22 (17%), including 2 recipients of haploidentical donor HCT and 20 recipients of MRD HCT. The time to the development of rhabdomyolysis was 61 and 73 days for the 2 recipients of haploidentical HCT and a median of 73 days for the MRD HCT recipients. Among the 22 patients who developed rhabdomyolysis, 20 (91%) were receiving sirolimus (2 haploidentical HCT recipients and 18 MRD HCT recipients), and 14 (64%) were also receiving TMP-SMX (all in the MRD HCT group). Seventy-five percent of the haploidentical donors and 69% of the MRDs had sickle cell trait. All but 2 patients with rhabdomyolysis were male. No patients who developed rhabdomyolysis were receiving statins at any point. Higher-than-expected rates of rhabdomyolysis were found post-transplantation for patients with SCD and beta-thalassemia. Contributing risk factors included immunosuppression with sirolimus, TMP-SMX, male sex, and sickle trait donor. These factors differ from the excessive muscle strain or injury, seizures, infections, or HMG-CoA inhibitors typically identified in non-HCT recipients.
33566985	OCCURRENCE OF UNUSUAL HAEMOGLOBINOPATHIES IN BALOCHISTAN: HB SD AND HB SE - PRESENTATION WITH OSTEOMYELITIS.	OBJECTIVE: To describe two cases of unusual variants of sickle cell disease. CASE DESCRIPTION: We present two cases of sickle cell disease variants (haemoglobinopathies), from unrelated families, in the state of Balochistan (Pakistan). One was diagnosed with sickle cell disease in the haemoglobin electrophoresis, whereas the other was diagnosed with sickle cell SE disease. Both were diagnosed based on the presentation of osteomyelitis. COMMENTS: Haemoglobin SD disease (Hb SD) and haemoglobin SE disease (Hb SE) are rare haemoglobinopathies in the world. The lack of available literature suggests that both are variants of sickle cell disease (SCD), with heterogeneous nature. The prevalence of sickle cell disease with compound heterozygotes was found at a variable frequency in the population of the Asian Southeast. The frequency of osteomyelitis in SCD is 12 to 18%, but its occurrence among variant haemoglobinopathies is little reported. Both reported cases presented with osteomyelitis as a characteristic of the disease presentation.
31891655	Assessment of health-related quality of life among adults hospitalized with sickle cell disease vaso-occlusive crisis.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is characterized by painful vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs). Self-reported pain intensity is often assessed with the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), whereas newer patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) assess multidimensional pain in SCD. We describe pain experiences among hospitalized adults with VOCs, using 2 PROMs: the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Global Health and the Adult Sickle Cell Quality of Life Measurement System (ASCQ-Me). Adults with SCD hospitalized with VOCs at 2 academic centers in Boston, Massachusetts, from April 2016 to October 2017 were eligible. Participants completed the NRS and PROMs at admission and 7 days postdischarge. PROM scores were described and compared with population norms. Length of stay (LOS) and 30-day readmission rates were assessed. Forty-two (96%) of 44 eligible patients consented and completed admission assessments. Mean age was 30.2 years (standard deviation, 9.1), 60% were women, 76% were non-Hispanic black, and 64% had hemoglobin SS. Twenty-seven participants (64%) completed postdischarge assessments. Sixty percent had >=4 VOCs in the last year. Nearly all PROMIS Global Health and ASCQ-Me scores were worse than population norms. NRS and PROMIS Global Physical Health scores improved after discharge, the latter driven principally by improvements in pain. Overall median LOS was 7 days, and 30-day readmission rate was 40.5%. Administration of PROMs among adults with SCD hospitalized for VOCs is feasible and demonstrates participants experienced recurrent, prolonged, and severe VOCs. PROMIS Global and ASCQ-Me scores indicated substantial suffering, and the striking 30-day readmission rate highlights the vulnerability of these patients.
34846319	Breaking the Cycle: Care Coordination Interventions and Sickle Cell Readmissions.	PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: Approximately 100,000 people in the United States are affected by sickle cell disease (SCD). Sickle cell disease represents one of the highest readmitting diagnoses at this organization. The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of implementing care coordination interventions to reduce hospital readmissions of patients with SCD. PRIMARY PRACTICE SETTING: The setting for conducting the interventions took place at the flagship hospital of a seven hospital system in Houston, TX. The hospital is a not-for-profit, faith-based, 907-bed academic facility that provides highly specialized health services to the community and the world. The population of focus was adult patients (18 years of age and older) admitted to the hospital with a primary diagnosis of SCD. FINDINGS/CONCLUSION: Two interventions were implemented: Disease-specific discharge education and scheduling postdischarge follow-up appointments prior to discharge. These interventions were conducted by bedside nurses, case managers, and SCD champions over a 6-month period. The 30-day readmission rate for SCD was reduced by 22%. There was also a 0.9-day reduction in length of stay and a 17% reduction in emergency, observation, and inpatient encounters of patients with SCD. IMPLICATIONS FOR CASE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES: This project found that implementing evidence-based care coordination interventions can reduce the 30-day readmission rate for patients with SCD. Implementation of effective evidence-based care coordination is a key aspect to reducing hospital readmissions of patients with SCD. Partnering with community networks is also important in addressing readmission risk factors including management of social determinants of health that increase hospital visits. Consistent, patient-centered education using simple and convenient tools helps improve understanding, applicability, and self-care management.
35177777	A randomised double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial of oral hydroxyurea for transfusion-dependent beta-thalassaemia.	Hydroxyurea is an antimetabolite drug that induces fetal haemoglobin in sickle cell disease. However, its clinical usefulness in beta-thalassaemia is unproven. We conducted a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of hydroxyurea in transfusion-dependent beta-thalassaemia. Sixty patients were assigned 1:1 to oral hydroxyurea 10-20 mg/kg/day or placebo for 6 months by stratified block randomisation. Hydroxyurea treatment did not alter the blood transfusion volume overall. However, a significantly higher proportion of patients on hydroxyurea showed increases in fetal haemoglobin percentage (89% vs. 59%; p < 0.05) and reductions in erythropoietic stress as measured by soluble transferrin receptor concentration (79% vs. 40%; p < 0.05). Based on fetal haemoglobin induction (> 1.5%), 44% of patients were identified as hydroxyurea-responders. Hydroxyurea-responders, required significantly lower blood volume (77 +- SD27ml/kg) compared to hydroxyurea-non-responders (108 +- SD24ml/kg; p < 0.01) and placebo-receivers (102 +- 28ml/kg; p < 0.05). Response to hydroxyurea was significantly higher in patients with HbE beta-thalassaemia genotype (50% vs. 0%; p < 0.01) and Xmn1 polymorphism of the gamma-globin gene (67% vs. 27%; p < 0.05). We conclude that oral hydroxyurea increased fetal haemoglobin percentage and reduced erythropoietic stress of ineffective erythropoiesis in patients with transfusion-dependent beta-thalassaemia. Hydroxyurea reduced the transfusion burden in approximately 40% of patients. Response to hydroxyurea was higher in patients with HbE beta-thalassaemia genotype and Xmn1 polymorphism of the gamma-globin gene.
38012299	Looking ahead: ethical and social challenges of somatic gene therapy for sickle cell disease in Africa.	Somatic gene therapy will be one of the most exciting practices of genetic medicine in Africa and is primed to offer a "new life" for persons living with sickle cell disease (SCD). Recently, successful gene therapy trials for SCD in the USA have sparked a ray of hope within the SCD community in Africa. However, the high cost, estimated to exceed 1.5 million USD, continues to be a major concern for many stakeholders. While affordability is a key global health equity consideration, it is equally important to reflect on other ethical, legal and social issues (ELSIs) that may impact the responsible implementation of gene therapy for SCD in Africa. These include informed consent comprehension, risk of therapeutic misestimation and optimistic bias; priorities for SCD therapy trials; dearth of ethical and regulatory oversight for gene therapy in many African countries; identifying a favourable risk-benefit ratio; criteria for the selection of trial participants; decisional conflict in consent; standards of care; bounded justice; and genetic tourism. Given these ELSIs, we suggest that researchers, pharma, funders, global health agencies, ethics committees, science councils and SCD patient support/advocacy groups should work together to co-develop: (1) patient-centric governance for gene therapy in Africa, (2) public engagement and education materials, and (3) decision making toolkits for trial participants. It is also critical to establish harmonised ethical and regulatory frameworks for gene therapy in Africa, and for global health agencies to accelerate access to basic care for SCD in Africa, while simultaneously strengthening capacity for gene therapy.
36748667	Successful therapeutic plasma exchange for a patient with sickle cell disease and fat embolism syndrome after a failure of a response to red cell exchange transfusion.	BACKGROUND: Fat embolism syndrome (FES) is a rare complication, which was reported mostly with milder forms of heterozygous sickle cell disease (SCD). It may present in a catastrophic way with multi-organ failure, particularly involving the pulmonary and neurological systems. Diagnosis is often missed or delayed; and the standard recommended treatment is red cell exchange (RCE) transfusion, which has sub-optimal results, such as debilitating long-term neurological complications. Recently, few reports suggested that the addition of Therapeutic Plasma Exchange (TPE) might further improve the outcome. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 23-year-old woman with homozygote SCD was admitted with bony pains and vaso-occlusive crises. However, her course evolved to respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, decreased level of consciousness, skin rash, severe anemia and thrombocytopenia and a picture consistent with thrombotic microangiopathy. MRI of the brain showed scattered multi-focal ischemic foci and cytotoxic edema. The patient received RCE on the third day after admission without improvement. On the seventh day, TPE was instituted (2 L/day of fresh frozen plasma for 5 days), following which she regained her consciousness and showed an improvement in her laboratory abnormalities. On follow up, she had gradual full neurological recovery and resolution of the MRI findings within a few months. CONCLUSION: FES remains a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge, with significant morbidity and mortality. Success in the management of this reported case with the addition of TPE to RCE supports the notion that TPE may be a potentially helpful modality that deserves further research.
32267841	Influence of sickle cell disease on susceptibility to HIV infection.	People with sickle cell disease (SCD) are reported to have low rates of HIV infection, slower progression to AIDS and lower HIV-associated mortality compared to the general population. Mechanisms of potential resistance to HIV in SCD are incompletely understood. We retrospectively reviewed the Transfusion Safety Study to compare HIV status between people with SCD and other congenital anemias who were routinely exposed to blood products during the high-risk period before HIV screening implementation. Non-SCD congenital anemia diagnosis was associated with a higher risk of HIV acquisition compared to SCD (OR 13.1 95%CI 1.6-108.9). In addition, we prospectively enrolled 30 SCD cases and 30 non-SCD controls to investigate potential mechanisms of resistance to HIV in SCD. CCR5 and CCR7 expression was lower and CD4 expression was higher on CD4+ T cells from SCD cases compared to controls. Surface expression of CD4+ T cell CXCR4, CD38 and HLA-DR did not differ between the groups. SCD CD4+ T cells were not less susceptible to HIV infection than controls. Levels of multiple cytokines were elevated in the SCD plasma, but SCD plasma compared to control plasma did not inhibit HIV infection of target cells. In conclusion, our epidemiological data support people with SCD being resistant to HIV infection. Potential mechanisms include lower CD4+ T cell expression of CCR5 and CCR7, balanced by increased CD4 expression and cytokine levels, which did not result in in vitro resistance to HIV infection. Further study is needed to define the risk and pathophysiology of HIV in persons with SCD.
33958740	Stable to improved cardiac and pulmonary function in children with high-risk sickle cell disease following haploidentical stem cell transplantation.	Children with sickle cell disease (SCD) are at high-risk of progressive, chronic pulmonary and cardiac dysfunction. In this prospective multicenter Phase II trial of myeloimmunoablative conditioning followed by haploidentical stem cell transplantation in children with high-risk SCD, 19 patients, 2.0-21.0 years of age, were enrolled with one or more of the following: history of (1) overt stroke; (2) silent stroke; (3) elevated transcranial Doppler velocity; (4) multiple vaso-occlusive crises; and/or (5) two or more acute chest syndromes and received haploidentical transplants from 18 parental donors. Cardiac and pulmonary centralized cores were established. Pulmonary function results were expressed as percent of the median of healthy reference cohorts, matched for age, sex, height and race. At 2 years, pulmonary functions including forced expiratory volume (FEV), FEV1/ forced vital capacity (FVC), total lung capacity (TLC), diffusing capacity of lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) were stable to improved compared to baseline values. Importantly, specific airway conductance was significantly improved at 2 years (p < 0.004). Left ventricular systolic function (fractional shortening) and tricuspid regurgitant velocity were stable at 2 years. These results demonstrate that haploidentical stem cell transplantation can stabilize or improve cardiopulmonary function in patients with SCD.
33399868	A Hemolytic Transfusion Reaction Caused by an Unexpected Leb Antibody.	A Black male patient aged 21 years with a history of sickle cell disease and HIV was admitted to the hospital with vaso-occlusive crisis. A transfusion reaction was called after the patient developed a fever (39.5 C), tachycardia, chills, and hematuria after receiving 300 mL of red blood cells. A posttransfusion specimen was submitted to the Immunohematology Reference Laboratory for investigation. Antibody identification revealed an anti-Leb as the probable cause of the immediate acute hemolytic transfusion reaction. Lewis antibodies are considered clinically insignificant. This case shows the importance of considering cold antibodies, including Lewis antibodies, as a possible cause of an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction.
32171610	Longitudinal Relationships Between Depression and Chronic Illness in Adolescents: An Integrative Review.	INTRODUCTION: Depression is prevalent among adolescents with chronic illness. However, little is known about how depression affects chronic illness over time. This review aimed to synthesize longitudinal relationships between depression and disease control, self-management behaviors, illness-related morbidity, and quality of life. METHOD: Four databases were searched, including PubMed, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, PsycINFO, and EMBASE. Inclusion criteria were cohort studies examining depression among adolescents aged 10-21 years with a chronic illness and studies published in English. Study quality was appraised using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale and data was synthesized by the outcome. RESULTS: Of the 3,463 articles identified, 11 were included in the review. For adolescents with diabetes, increased depressive symptoms predicted decreased metabolic control and monitoring, medication adherence, quality of life, and increased hospitalization. Studies on cystic fibrosis, congenital heart disease, sickle cell disease, and juvenile idiopathic arthritis were limited but demonstrated that depressive symptoms affected the quality of life, disability, pain, and hospitalization rates/costs. DISCUSSION: Evidence supports the need for mental health care strategies suitable for adolescents with chronic illness. Future research is needed to examine the effects of depressive symptoms across diversified chronic illness populations.
36510904	Impact of hydroxyurea on hospital stay & analgesic utilization in sickle cell anaemia with vaso-occlusive crises.	Background & objectives: Hydroxyurea (HU) has been useful in preventing sickle cell vaso-occlusive crises (VOC). A few studies also suggest utility of HU, during acute VOC. Sickle cell anaemia (SCA) is of high prevalence in western districts of Odisha State, India, and VOC is a common presentation, despite being mostly of Arab-Indian haplotype. This study was undertaken to evaluate the impact of HU on hospital stay and analgesic utilization in acute painful VOC of SCA. Methods: Homozygous sickle cell disease (HbSS) patients were categorized as cases who were receiving low-dose HU (10 mg/kg/day) and patients who were not on HU were considered as control. Days of hospital stay, analgesic utilization and visual analogue scale (VAS) score in patients were compared with that of control. Analgesics used to control pain were tramadol hydrochloride, ketorolac and diclofenac. Results: A total of 359 homozygous sickle cell disease (SCD) patients with VOC were studied (187 patients and 172 controls). The patient group had lesser mean days of hospital stay (1.4 days less than controls, P<0.001) and required lesser days of analgesic utilization than controls (1.18 days less than controls, P<0.001). Significant differences were observed between patients and controls concerning VAS score and amount of tramadol hydrochloride, ketorolac and diclofenac utilization (P<0.05). Interpretation & conclusions: In this study, HU was found to have beneficial effects in acute VOC of homozygous SCD, which includes shortening the duration of hospital stay and reducing the net amount of analgesic utilization during hospitalization.
33026052	Outcomes of multidisciplinary team interventions in the management of sickle cell disease patients with opioid use disorders. A retrospective cohort study.	OBJECTIVES: To identify the magnitude of opioid use disorder (OUD) among sickle cell disease (SCD) patients; emphasize on multidisciplinary team (MDT) role; estimate cost-effectiveness following the proper use of therapeutic guidelines; and facilitate the reduction of emergency room (ER) visits and the length of stay (LOS). METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included SCD patients aged 14 years and above, who have OUD. Data was collected between January 2016 and December 2018. Data included ER visits, hospital LOS, opioid consumption, and narcotic prescription tracking. The target group was followed with a set of interventions for pain management and healthcare resource utilization. Results: Twenty one SCD patients were identified with OUD. Following the interventions, there was a statistically significant decrease in ER visits of these OUD patients (from 8709 visits in 2016 to only 94 in 2018). Morphine consumption decreased by 82% and meperidine by 60%, over the 3-year period. Moreover, there was a huge reduction in both ER and LOS costs for this cohort of patients. CONCLUSION: Establishing an MDT and a series of interventions for SCD patients with OUD, including educational activities for caregivers and patients; establishing a palliative/pain clinic and a SCD addiction clinic; and implementing an adequate opioid prescription tracking system resulted in a significant reduction in both the cost and number of ER visits and hospital LOS and dramatically decreased opioid consumption.
33519708	Consequences of beta-Thalassemia or Sickle Cell Disease for Ovarian Follicle Number and Morphology in Girls Who Had Ovarian Tissue Cryopreserved.	Women with beta-thalassemia (BT) and sickle cell disease (SCD) have a high risk of infertility and premature ovarian insufficiency. Different fertility preserving strategies, including ovarian tissue cryopreservation (OTC) and oocyte cryopreservation has been considered, and healthy babies have been born after successful OTC and transplantation. We evaluated follicle number and follicle health in ovarian tissue from a cohort of BT and SCD patients who underwent OTC before the age of 18 years. Patients undergoing OTC from 2002 to 2019 were included. A total of 14 girls and adolescents with BT and four with SCD, aged 2.8-17.4 years at OTC were included together with a reference group of 43 girls and adolescents with non-anemia diseases considered to have normal ovaries aged 0.6-17.9 years at OTC. Ovarian follicle density was measured in cortex biopsies and compared to the reference group. Expression of proteins associated with follicular health was evaluated using immunohistochemistry. Follicles were detected in the ovarian cortex biopsies from all patients with BT and SCD. The follicle densities were within the 95% prediction interval of the reference group in all cases. A similar expression of six proteins essential for follicular health was detected using immunohistochemistry in BT, SCD, and references. OTC should be considered an option for young girls and adolescents with BT and SCD.
37158403	Impact of prenatal corticosteroid therapy on sickle cell disease in pregnant women.	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate safety of prenatal corticosteroids in pregnancies of women with sickle cell disease. METHODS: A multicenter observational study of patients with sickle cell disease, comparing vaso-occlusive crises (VOC) requiring hospital care between pregnancies with versus without prenatal corticosteroids. RESULTS: In 40 pregnancies exposed to prenatal corticosteroids, compared with 370 unexposed pregnancies, VOC were not more frequent (62.5% vs 57.9%, P = 0.578) but they were more severe, with more intensive care hospitalizations (25.0% vs 12.9%, P = 0.039), emergency transfusions (44.7% vs 22.7%, P = 0.006), and acute chest syndromes (22.5% vs 8.9%, P = 0.010). These differences persisted after adjustment for severity and type of sickle cell syndrome (for intensive care admission adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.10-6.79, P = 0.031 and for acute chest syndrome aOR 4.15, 95% CI 1.57-14.4, P = 0.008). VOC occurred on average 1.2 days following steroid administration. When comparing 36 patients receiving corticosteroids for fetal maturation with 58 patients who were hospitalized for obstetrical complications before 34 weeks of pregnancy but that did not receive corticosteroids, VOC incidence was not significantly higher (41.7% vs 31.5%, P = 0.323). CONCLUSION: The present study was the first to study the impact of prenatal corticosteroids on sickle cell disease. They were associated with more severe VOC, suggesting that steroids should be avoided in these women.
33097032	Characterization of HIV risks in a Brazilian sickle cell disease population.	BACKGROUND: A low prevalence of HIV in sickle cell disease (SCD) patients has been reported in the literature though mechanisms for this are not understood. METHODS: HIV risk behaviors were compared between SCD cases and non-SCD controls using a self-administered audio computer-assisted self-interview. SCD cases were recruited from a multi-center SCD cohort established in Brazil; controls were recruited from SCD social contacts. Categorical variables were analyzed using Chi-Square or Fisher exact test. Continuous variables were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: There were 152 SCD cases and 154 age/location matched controls enrolled at three participating Brazilian centers during 2016-17. No significant differences in number of sexual partners (lifetime or previous 12 months), male-to-male sex partners or intravenous drug use were observed. Cases received more transfusions, surgeries, and acupuncture treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Besides the risk of transfusion-transmitted HIV, which is now exceedingly rare, SCD and non-SCD participants demonstrated similar HIV risk behaviors. Causes other than risk behaviors such as factors inherent to SCD pathophysiology may explain the reported low prevalence of HIV in SCD.
32432400	Utilising red cell antigen genotyping and serological phenotyping in sickle cell disease patients to risk-stratify patients for alloimmunisation risk.	BACKGROUND: Alloimmunisation and haemolytic transfusion reactions (HTRs) can occur in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) despite providing phenotype-matched red blood cell (RBC) transfusions. Variant RBC antigen gene alleles/polymorphisms can lead to discrepancies in serological phenotyping. We evaluated differences between RBC antigen genotyping and phenotyping methods and retrospectively assessed if partial antigen expression may lead to increased risk of alloimmunisation and HTRs in SCD patients at a tertiary centre in Canada. METHODS: RBC antigen phenotyping and genotyping were performed by a reference laboratory on consenting SCD patients. Patient demographic, clinical and transfusion-related data were obtained from a local transfusion registry and chart review after research ethics board approval. RESULTS: A total of 106 SCD patients were enrolled, and 91% (n = 96) showed additional clinically relevant genotyping information when compared to serological phenotyping alone. FY*02N.01 (FY*B GATA-1) (n = 95; 90%) and RH variant alleles (n = 52, 49%; majority accompanied by FY*02N.01) were common, the latter with putative partial antigen expression in 25 patients. Variability in genotype-phenotype antigen prediction occurred mostly in the Rh system, notably with the e antigen (kappa: 0.17). Fifteen (14.2%) patients had a history of alloimmunisation, with five having HTR documented; no differences in clinical outcomes were found in patients with partial antigen expression. Genotype/extended-phenotype matching strategies may have prevented alloimmunisation events. CONCLUSION: We show a high frequency of variant alleles/polymorphisms in the SCD population, where genotyping may complement serological phenotyping. Genotyping SCD patients before transfusion may prevent alloimmunisation and HTRs, and knowledge of the FY*02N.01 variant allele increases feasibility of finding compatible blood.
32034210	Epidemiology and Predictors of all-cause 30-Day readmission in patients with sickle cell crisis.	The 30-day readmission rate after hospitalization for a sickle cell crisis (SCC) is extremely high. Accurate information on readmission diagnoses, total readmission costs and factors associated with readmission is required to effectively plan resource allocation and to plan interventions to reduce readmission rates. The present study aimed to examine readmission diagnoses and factors associated with all-cause 30-day readmission after hospitalization for SCC. We analyzed 2016 nationwide readmission database (NRD) to identify patterns of 30-day readmission by patient demographic characteristics and time after hospitalization for SCC. We estimated the percentage and most common readmission diagnoses for 30-day and 7-day readmissions after discharge. We studied the relationship between risk factors and readmission and the impact of readmission on patient outcomes and resulting financial burden on health care in dollars. In 2016, of 67,887 discharges after index hospitalizations, 18099 (26.9%) were readmitted within 30-days. Of all readmissions, 5166 (7.6%) were readmitted within 7 days. The spectrum of readmission diagnoses was largely similar in both 30-day and 7-day readmission with more than 80% patients in both time periods readmitted with diagnoses related to SCC. The mean length of stay for readmitted patients was significantly longer than the index hospitalization (5.3 days (5.1-5.5) vs 4.9 days (CI 4.8-5.1, p < 0.01). Also, the mean cost of hospitalization in readmitted patients $8485 was significantly higher than the index hospitalization $8064 p < 0.01. In 2016, readmission among patients with SCC incurred an additional 95,445 hospitalization days resulting a total charge of $609 million and a total cost of $152 million in the US. On Multivariate analysis, age group 18-30 years, discharge against medical advice, higher Charlson comorbidity index, low socioeconomic status and admission at high volume centers were associated with a higher likelihood of 30-day readmission. Among patients hospitalized for SCC, 30-day readmissions were frequent throughout the month post hospitalization and resulted in an enormous financial burden on the United States healthcare system.
35836008	Phenotypes of sickle cell intensive care admissions: an unsupervised machine learning approach in a single-center retrospective cohort.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is associated with multiple known complications and increased mortality. This study aims to further understand the profile of intensive care unit (ICU) admissions of SCD patients. In this single-center retrospective cohort (approval number 0926-11), we evaluated SCD-related ICU admissions at our hospital in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Admissions were clustered using clinical data and organ dysfunction at ICU admission. A hierarchical clustering method was used to distinguish phenotypes. From 140 admissions obtained, 125 were included. The mean age was 30 years, 48% were male, and SS genotype was predominant (71.2%). Non-surgical causes of admissions accounted for 85.6% (n = 107). The mean Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (SOFA) was 4 (IQR 2-7). Vasopressors were required by 12% and mechanical ventilation by 17.6%. After analysis of the average silhouette width, the optimal number of clusters was 3: cluster 1 (n = 69), cluster 2 (n = 25), cluster 3 (n = 31). Cluster 1 had a mean age of 29 years, 87% of SS genotype, and mean SOFA of 4. Cluster 2 had a mean age of 37 years, 80% of SS genotype, and mean SOFA of 8. Cluster 3 had a mean age of 26 years, 29% of SS genotype, and mean SOFA of 3. The need for mechanical ventilation was 11.6%, 44%, and 9.7%, respectively. Mortality was significantly higher in cluster 2 (44%, p = 0.012). This cohort of critical SCD admissions suggested the presence of three different profiles. This can be informative in the ICU setting to identify SCD patients at higher risk of worse outcomes.

34551184	A systematic review of cases of West African crystalline maculopathy.	AIM: West African crystalline maculopathy (WACM) is, reportedly, a rare condition whose aetiology remains unclear. This study aims to describe the epidemiology, summarizing the identified risk factors and clinical characteristics of cases of WACM, with the goal of highlighting presentation patterns and the clinical course of the condition. METHODS: A comprehensive PubMed, Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science, OMIM and Google scholar search of all articles written in English, and non-English language articles with abstract translated to English on WACM was carried out. Only full case reports and series were included. Data reviewed included epidemiology, risk factors, clinical presentations, imaging characteristics, management and prognosis of WACM. Information on the location of the study was also extracted. RESULTS: Ten studies - seven case reports and three case series - comprising of 30 patients were included. The patients were from West, Central and North-east Africa, with all the studies carried out in North America and Europe. The majority of the patients (76.7%) had diabetes mellitus, 80% had a vascular retinopathy (diabetic retinopathy, sickle cell retinopathy, familial exudative vitreoretinopathy and branch retinal vein occlusion) and 50% had macular oedema. There was no report of associated visual impairment or retinal degeneration. Clinical improvement in the number of crystals was documented in two cases with retinal laser photocoagulation for associated vascular retinopathies. Clinical observation was employed by most clinicians. CONCLUSION: West African crystalline retinopathy is a seemingly innocuous condition affecting black or African people, who were also born in Africa. The majority of the patients have a vascular retinopathy. Longitudinal studies, particularly in Africa, may be required to elucidate the aetiology, as well as the long-term prognosis, of the crystals.

33152749	Hemolysis inhibits humoral B-cell responses and modulates alloimmunization risk in patients with sickle cell disease.	Red blood cell alloimmunization remains a barrier for safe and effective transfusions in sickle cell disease (SCD), but the associated risk factors remain largely unknown. Intravascular hemolysis, a hallmark of SCD, results in the release of heme with potent immunomodulatory activity, although its effect on SCD humoral response, specifically alloimmunization, remains unclear. Here, we found that cell-free heme suppresses human B-cell plasmablast and plasma cell differentiation by inhibiting the DOCK8/STAT3 signaling pathway, which is critical for B-cell activation, as well as by upregulating heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) through its enzymatic byproducts, carbon monoxide and biliverdin. Whereas nonalloimmunized SCD B cells were inhibited by exogenous heme, B cells from the alloimmunized group were nonresponsive to heme inhibition and readily differentiated into plasma cells. Consistent with a differential B-cell response to hemolysis, we found elevated B-cell basal levels of DOCK8 and higher HO-1-mediated inhibition of activated B cells in nonalloimmunized compared with alloimmunized SCD patients. To overcome the alloimmunized B-cell heme insensitivity, we screened several heme-binding molecules and identified quinine as a potent inhibitor of B-cell activity, reversing the resistance to heme suppression in alloimmunized patients. B-cell inhibition by quinine occurred only in the presence of heme and through HO-1 induction. Altogether, these data suggest that hemolysis can dampen the humoral B-cell response and that B-cell heme responsiveness maybe a determinant of alloimmunization risk in SCD. By restoring B-cell heme sensitivity, quinine may have therapeutic potential to prevent and inhibit alloimmunization in SCD patients.
35472468	Pediatric Vulvovaginal Graft-Versus-Host Disease: A Retrospective Cohort Study and Literature Review.	STUDY OBJECTIVE: To assess genital symptomatology, characterize the findings of genital examination, and describe the incidence and treatment of vulvovaginal graft-versus-host disease (vvGvHD) in girls and adolescents after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). DESIGN: Retrospective cohort. SETTING: Metropolitan-area children's hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Female allogeneic HSCT recipients ages 0 to 22 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Genital symptoms, genital examination, diagnosis, and treatment of vvGvHD. RESULTS: A total of 57 participants were included in the analysis. The median age at the time of HSCT was 10 years (range 4 months-23 years). Most (n = 40, 71%) underwent transplant for a nonmalignant condition, most commonly sickle cell anemia (n = 19, 33%). The median time of onset of GvHD post HSCT was 62 days (IQR = 42 to 151 days). The most common initial site of GvHD was skin (n = 21, 64%), followed by GI tract (n = 10, 30%). Three patients (5%) were diagnosed with vvGvHD. The time of onset of vvGvHD post HSCT ranged from 62 to 1565 days. One patient (33%) was asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. There was no difference in diagnosis of vvGvHD when race (P = 0.15), age at allogeneic HSCT (P = 0.64), nonmalignant vs malignant indication (P = 0.21), source of stem cells (P = 0.25), partial vs full human leukocyte antigens (HLA) donor match (P = 0.34), and GvHD prophylaxis regimen (P = 0.18) were compared. None had isolated vvGvHD. Vulvovaginal GvHD was preceded by skin GvHD in 1 patient, was preceded by lung GvHD in 1 patient, and occurred concurrently with skin GvHD in the third patient. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric vvGvHD can occur within the first 100 days after transplant and can be asymptomatic. Routine gynecologic evaluation post allogeneic HSCT in children and adolescents should include a thorough review of vulvovaginal symptoms and a gynecologic exam for the detection and treatment of vvGvHD.
33705373	Can subjective pain be inferred from objective physiological data? Evidence from patients with sickle cell disease.	Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) experience lifelong struggles with both chronic and acute pain, often requiring medical interventMaion. Pain can be managed with medications, but dosages must balance the goal of pain mitigation against the risks of tolerance, addiction and other adverse effects. Setting appropriate dosages requires knowledge of a patient's subjective pain, but collecting pain reports from patients can be difficult for clinicians and disruptive for patients, and is only possible when patients are awake and communicative. Here we investigate methods for estimating SCD patients' pain levels indirectly using vital signs that are routinely collected and documented in medical records. Using machine learning, we develop both sequential and non-sequential probabilistic models that can be used to infer pain levels or changes in pain from sequences of these physiological measures. We demonstrate that these models outperform null models and that objective physiological data can be used to inform estimates for subjective pain.
37795523	Busulfan-fludarabine- or treosulfan-fludarabine-based conditioning before allogeneic HSCT from matched sibling donors in paediatric patients with sickle cell disease: A study on behalf of the EBMT Paediatric Diseases and Inborn Errors Working Parties.	How important is choice of conditioning regimen in allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for sickle cell disease (SCD)? We compared HSCT outcomes by conditioning regimen in paediatric patients with SCD from the EBMT registry. In 2010-2020, 251 patients aged <18 years underwent a first matched sibling donor (MSD) HSCT with conditioning based on busulfan-fludarabine (bu-flu; n = 89) or treosulfan-fludarabine (treo-flu; n = 162). In the bu-flu and treo-flu groups, 51.7% and 99.4% of patients, respectively, received thiotepa. Median follow-up was 2.7 years. Two-year overall survival (OS) was 98.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 90.9-99.8) with bu-flu and 99.3% (95% CI: 95.2-99.9) with treo-flu (p = 0.63). Grade III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) at 100 days was 2.4% (95% CI: 0.4-7.5) and 0.6% (0.1%-3.2%) for bu-flu and treo-flu respectively (p = 0.25). The 2-year incidence of extensive chronic GVHD was 1.5% (95% CI: 0.1-7.3) with bu-flu and 8.0% (95% CI: 4.1-13.3) with treo-flu (p = 0.057). These multinational data confirm the excellent curative capacity of MSD HSCT with myeloablative conditioning. Both conditioning regimens yielded excellent OS, low rates of acute and chronic GVHD, and low rates of graft failure.
31860969	The role of hydroxyurea to prevent silent stroke in sickle cell disease: Systematic review and meta-analysis.	BACKGROUND: Chronic blood transfusions are standard of care for stroke prevention in sickle cell disease but is not cost effective and not without risks. Hydroxyurea has emerged as an option in the prevention of silent stroke in sickle cell disease. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of hydroxyurea in preventing silent strokes in a systematic review by adhering to the Cochrane guidelines. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science Core Collection, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for the related articles. Eligibility criteria included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the use of hydroxyurea vs blood transfusions and observational studies evaluating the role of hydroxyurea to prevent stroke and silent stroke in patients with sickle cell anemia or sickle cell beta thalassemia. The meta-analysis was conducted using STATA software version 13. RESULTS: We included 10 single arm observational studies with 361 participants, and one RCT study with 60 participants receiving hydroxyurea, respectively. There were no deaths attributed to hydroxyurea. The results revealed that 1% (95% CIs 0.0 to 0.05) of patients receiving hydroxyurea had stroke. 18% (95% CIs 0.03 to 0.4) of the hydroxyurea patients had silent stroke. 24% (95% CIs 0.02 to 0.57) of the hydroxyurea patients had adverse events attributed to hydroxyurea. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that hydroxyurea is safe and may prevent silent stroke and stroke in sickle cell disease. More high-quality studies including RCTs are needed.
32051994	Impact of plasma concentration of transferrin on targeting capacity of nanoparticles.	It is becoming increasingly accepted that various diseases have a capacity to alter the composition of plasma proteins. This alteration in protein composition may consequently change the targeting capacity of nanoparticles (NPs). In this study, the impact of a model targeting ligand's (i.e., Transferrin; Tf) concentration in human plasma on the targeting capacity of gold NPs (Au NPs), pre-conjugated with Tf, is investigated. Our findings demonstrate that the protein corona formation by both healthy and Tf depleted human plasma diminishes the targeting efficacy of Au NPs within human cancer cells despite a preservation of targeting ability by plasma with excess Tf (10-fold). Moreover, the plasma samples obtained from patients with various Tf levels (e.g., thalassemia major, sickle cell anemia, aplastic anemia, and iron deficiency anemia) have affected the accessibility of the targeting Tf in the corona layer and subsequently affected their targeting ability, which emphasizes the critical role of disease-specific protein corona on the efficacy of Au NPs. Ultimately, variations of protein concentration (e.g., due to disease occurrence and progress) in plasma affect its recruiting in corona formation, and in turn, affect the targeting and therapeutic efficacies of Au NPs.

33677007	Anti-sickling activities of two isolated compounds from the root of Combretum racemosum P. beauv. (Combretaceae).	ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Evaluation of plants such as Combretum racemosum with claimed traditional use in the management of sickle cell anaemia in Nigeria and other parts of West Africa could serve as a useful research strategy in the search for potential anti-sickling drugs and templates. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed at evaluating the antisickling potential of C. racemosum by activity-guided purification and isolation of its active constituents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Crude methanol extract of the root of C. racemosum and the fractions obtained by partitioning with chloroform, ethyl acetate, and aqueous were investigated for anti-sickling activity against sodium metabisulphite induced sickling of sickle cell haemoglobin (HbSS). Repeated chromatographic separations were conducted on the most active chloroform fraction to purify and isolate bioactive compounds for further tests for anti-sickling activity. The characterization of the isolated compounds was done by mass spectrometry (FD+MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (1HNMR) spectroscopy. RESULTS: The chloroform fraction (FA) (% sickled erythrocyte ranged from 3.0 to 34.1) exhibited better anti-sickling activity than aqueous (% sickled erythrocyte ranged from 38.9 to 51.5) as well as the crude methanol (% sickled erythrocyte ranged from 19.1 to 30.4). Hence, the phytochemical investigation was focused on the chloroform fraction, which led to the identification of two ellagic acid derivatives (3,3',4'-tri-O-methyl ellagic acid (A) and 3,3'-di-O- methyl ellagic acid (B). The two isolated compounds possessed good, comparable anti-sickling activities with compound A exhibiting a slightly better in vitro activity. CONCLUSION: This paper reports for the first time anti-sickling principles from C. racemosum and therefore, provided some justification for the ethnomedicinal use of the plant in the management of sickle cell disease.
36102140	HLA Class II regulation of immune response in sickle cell disease patients: Susceptibility to red blood cell alloimmunization (systematic review and meta-analysis).	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Sickle cell disease (SCD) patients are commonly treated with red blood cell (RBC) transfusion. Pretransfusion tests commonly involve limited serological antibody testing. RBC alloimmunization to RBC antigens is a frequently encountered complication seen in chronically transfused patients. Genetic factors such as the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) are known to influence and regulate immune responses. HLAs are highly polymorphic and play an essential role in regulating immune responses, including RBC alloimmunization. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the association between HLA Class II allelic polymorphisms with the possible risk of developing RBC alloantibodies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four databases were systematically searched for relevant studies between the years 2000 and 2021 following the PRISMA guidelines. Four articles met the eligibility and quality criterion, and three alleles, HLA-DRB1*04, HLA-DRB1*15 and HLA-DQB1*03, that were found to be potentially associated with an increased risk in alloantibody formation were included. RESULTS: The primary outcome measure was alloimmunization by RBC antigen exposure in multiply transfused SCD patients. The total estimate of alloimmunization of the SCD patients was 2.33 (95% CI, 1.58-3.44), demonstrating susceptibility to RBC alloantibody formation. Heterogeneity between the studies was insignificant, suggesting the differences associated with random sampling errors. The results showed that SCD patients carry an increased risk of producing RBC alloantibodies. CONCLUSION: A strategy to prevent RBC alloimmunization is genotyping for genetically susceptible SCD patients receiving multiple transfusions. Early identification of genetic variants that can potentially increase the risk of RBC alloimmunization could aid in the screening process and selection of phenotypically matched RBC units.
35218242	Outcomes of kidney donors with sickle cell trait: A preliminary analysis.	Most transplant centers do not screen kidney donor candidates for sickle cell trait (SCT) and many decline candidates with SCT since it may associate with kidney disease. We compared 17 kidney donors with SCT to propensity score matched donor controls on mortality, reduced eGFR, proteinuria and kidney failure. The prevalence of SCT in African American (AA) donors was 11 per 1000 compared to 73 per 1000 in non-donor AA. Donors with SCT were younger; 33 versus 35 years in controls, nine were AA, six were White, and two were listed as other or unknown ethnicities. After a follow-up period of 18.2 +- 10.5 years, the proportions of donors with SCT and controls who were alive, developed hypertension or cardiovascular disease were similar. No donor with SCT developed an eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 or kidney failure. SCT was, however, associated with increased risk of proteinuria; RR 5.71 (95% CI 5.7 - 22.7), P = .01. This small and preliminary case series suggest that donors with SCT should perhaps be considered more often provided they were aware of the lack of evidence to support liberal acceptance and that these outcomes reported here likely represent a healthy cohort of donors with SCT.
32419156	Blood transfusion support for sickle cell patients during haematopoietic stem cell transplantation: a single-institution experience.	
32202243	What is the place of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in the management of cerebral vasculopathy in children with sickle cell anemia?	Cerebral vasculopathy is the most severe complication affecting children with sickle cell anemia. Significant progress has been made in the management of sickle cell anemia cerebral vasculopathy, including early transcranial Doppler screening, chronic transfusion, andhydroxyurea. Nevertheless, for patients with a potential matched-sibling donor (MSD), stem cell transplantation (SCT) is now the treatment offering the best cerebral vasculopathy outcome. In the absence of MSD,alternative SCT should be recommended only in those with worsening cerebral vasculopathy despite standard treatments, and should be limited to related haplo-identical SCT undertaken in controlled studies.
35018749	Assessing and managing people with sickle cell disease presenting with vaso-occlusive crisis in the emergency department.	Sickle cell disease is a group of inherited blood disorders characterised by atypical haemoglobin molecule structures (haemoglobin S) which can manifest as painful vaso-occlusive crises, chronic anaemia and progressive organ damage. This article aims to raise greater awareness of sickle cell disease, its acute manifestations and the potential for rapid clinical deterioration that can occur in patients with this condition. The article outlines the main aspects of the assessment and management of patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with vaso-occlusive crisis, describes the barriers to effective care that they commonly experience and explains how their care could be improved. The authors emphasise the importance of timely management of these patients by ED staff, including emergency nurses.
38570214	Prevention of potential delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction in two sickle cell patients using intravenous immunoglobulins and steroids before and after red blood cell exchange with antigen positive units and review literature.	Emergent Red Blood Cell (RBC) exchange is indicated in sickle cell disease (SCD) patients with severe acute chest syndrome. However, fully matched RBC units may not be available for patients with multiple RBC antibodies. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and steroids were reported for preventing potential delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction (HTR) in simple transfusion of antigen-positive RBCs. We investigated the efficacy and safety of IVIG and steroids in two SCD patients presented with acute chest syndrome receiving RBC exchange with multiple incompatible units. The first patient had multiple historical alloantibodies, including anti-Jsb, although none of them were reactive. IVIG (1 g/kg) was given before and after RBC exchange with methylprednisolone (500 mg IV) one hour before exchange. Her sickle hemoglobin (HbS) was reduced from 89.4% to 17.4% after the exchange with five Jsb-positive units. The patient improved clinically without acute or delayed hemolysis. The second patient had reactive anti-Jsb on two different admissions 18 months apart. Only one of the sixteen units used in the exchanges was Jsb negative. He received the same IVIG regimen during both admissions but 100 mg IV hydrocortisone instead of methylprednisolone. His HbS was reduced from 63.4% to 22.4% after the first exchange. Significant clinical improvements were achieved after both exchanges. No delayed HTR was observed. Our experience of these two patients suggested that IVIG and steroids may be used in preventing potential delayed HTR in some SCD patients with rare antibodies receiving large amounts of antigen-positive RBC products.
38680015	Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation in Sickle Cell Disease: A Multidimentional Review.	While exagamglogene autotemcel (Casgevy) and lovotibeglogene autotemcel (Lyfgenia) have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as the first cell-based gene therapies for the treatment of patients 12 years of age and older with sickle cell disease (SCD), this treatment is not universally accessible. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) has the potential to eradicate the symptoms of patients with SCD, but a significant obstacle in HSCT for SCD is the availability of suitable donors, particularly human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched related donors. Furthermore, individuals with SCD face an elevated risk of complications during stem cell transplantation due to SCD-related tissue damage, endothelial activation, and inflammation. Therefore, it is imperative to consider optimal conditioning regimens and investigate HSCT from alternative donors. This review encompasses information on the use of HSCT in patients with SCD, including the indications for HSCT, conditioning regimens, alternative donors, and posttransplant outcomes.
33779245	For which diseases do broader value elements matter most? An evaluation across 20 ICER evidence reports.	BACKGROUND: U.S. value framework developers such as the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) use cost-effectiveness analysis to value new health care technologies. Often, these value assessment frameworks use a health system perspective without fully accounting for societal and broader benefits and costs of an intervention. Although there is ongoing debate about the most appropriate methods for including broader value elements in value assessment, it remains unclear whether the inclusion of these value elements is likely to affect the quantitative estimates of treatment value. OBJECTIVE: To assess variations in the relevance of broader value elements to cost-effectiveness analysis across diseases. METHODS: Thirty-two broader value elements (e.g., caregiver burden, health equity, real option value, productivity) not traditionally included in health technology assessments were identified through a targeted literature review. Evidence reports published by ICER between July 2017 and January 2020 were evaluated to identify which broader value elements were discussed as relevant to each disease in the report text. The study examined whether there were associations among ICER's discussion of broader value elements, rare disease status, treatment cost, estimated treatment cost-effectiveness, and ICER committee voting results for contextual considerations and additional benefits/disadvantages. RESULTS: The most commonly cited broader value element category in the ICER evidence reports was household and leisure (e.g., absenteeism from normal activities and caregiver burden). More value elements were cited for inherited retinal disease (19 elements) and sickle cell disease (18 elements) than for other diseases. Cardiovascular disease and diabetes had the fewest number of value elements cited (7 elements). Rare diseases were more likely to have broader value elements cited compared with nonrare diseases (15.9 vs. 11.5, P < 0.001). Treatments with higher (i.e., less favorable) incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were more likely to have a greater number of broader value elements cited (rho = 0.625, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of broader value elements varied across diseases, with less cost-effective treatments more likely to have a higher number of relevant broader value elements. Inclusion of all relevant value elements in value assessments will more appropriately incentivize innovation and improve allocation of research funding.

35456398	Vignette-Based Reflections to Inform Genetic Testing Policies in Living Kidney Donors.	Family history of kidney disease increases risk of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) in donors. Pre-donation genetic testing is recommended in evaluation guidelines and regulatory policy. Collaborating across several institutions, we describe cases to illustrate the utility as well as practical issues in incorporating genetic testing in transplant protocols. Case 1 is from 2009, before pervasive genetic testing. A healthy 27-year-old Caucasian male had an uneventful donor evaluation for his mother, who had early onset ESKD of unclear cause. He participated in paired-exchange kidney donation, but developed progressive kidney disease and gout over the next 10 years. A uromodulin gene mutation (NM_003361.3(UMOD):c.377 G>A p.C126Y) was detected and kidney biopsy showed tubulointerstitial kidney disease. The patient subsequently required kidney transplantation himself. Case 2 was a 36-year-old African American female who had an uneventful kidney donor evaluation. She underwent gene panel-based testing to rule out ApolipoproteinL1 risk variants, for which was negative. Incidentally, a sickle-cell trait (NM_000518.5(HBB):c.20A>T p.Glu7Val) was noted, and she was declined for kidney donation. This led to significant patient anguish. Case 3 was a 26-year-old Caucasian female who underwent panel-based testing because the potential recipient, her cousin, carried a variant of uncertain significance in the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1-beta (HNF1B) gene. While the potential donor did not harbor this variant, she was found to have a likely pathogenic variant in complement factor I (NM_000204.4(CFI):c.1311dup:p.Asp438Argfs*8), precluding kidney donation. Our cases emphasize that while genetic testing can be invaluable in donor evaluation, transplant centers should utilize detailed informed consent, develop care pathways for secondary genetic findings, and share experience to develop best practices around genetic testing in donors.
34991920	l-glutamine, crizanlizumab, voxelotor, and cell-based therapy for adult sickle cell disease: Hype or hope?	For more than two decades, hydroxyurea was the only therapeutic agent approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for sickle cell disease (SCD). Although curative allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants (allo-HSCT) were also available, only very few patients underwent the procedure due to lack of matched-related donors. However, therapeutic options for SCD patients increased dramatically in the last few years. Three new agents, l-glutamine, crizanlizumab, and voxelotor, were approved by the FDA for use in SCD patients. The number of SCD patients who underwent allo-HSCT also increased as a result of advances in the prevention of graft failure and graft-versus-host disease from using mismatched donor HSC. More recently gene therapy was made available on clinical trials. The increased treatment options for SCD have led to a sense of optimism and excitement among many physicians that these new approaches would alter the clinical course and disease burden. Although these newer agents do provide hope to SCD patients, the hyped-up responses need to be evaluated in the context of reality. In this review, we will discuss and compare these new agents and cell-based therapy, evaluate their clinical and economic impacts, and examine their roles in reducing the disease burden.

32305060	Patient and family experience with chronic transfusion therapy for sickle cell disease: A qualitative study.	BACKGROUND: There is a limited understanding of the patient and family experience of Chronic Transfusion Therapy (CTT) for prevention of complications of Sickle Cell Disease (SCD). We sought to understand patient and family experience with CTT using qualitative methods. METHODS: Fifteen parents of children < 18 years old and nine children 12-18 years old with SCD who were receiving CTT for > 1 year were interviewed using a semi-structured interview format, and interviews were analyzed using open coding methods. RESULTS: Four themes created a narrative of the patient and family experience of CTT: 1) Burden of CTT, 2) Coping with CTT, 3) Perceived benefits and risks of CTT, and 4) Decision making regarding CTT. Participants reported substantial burden of CTT, including the impact of CTT on daily life and family, distress about venous access, burden of chelation therapy, and anxiety about CTT complications. Participants described how they coped with CTT. Participants reported increased energy, decreased pain, fewer hospitalizations, and stroke prevention with CTT, but also recognized complications of CTT, though awareness was limited in adolescents. Parents described sharing in the informed decision-making process with their healthcare provider about CTT, but adolescent patient participants reported that they were not involved in this process. CONCLUSIONS: CTT is associated with significant patient and family burden. Support from family, healthcare providers and school may help individuals cope with some of this burden. These findings provide the basis for future studies to identify strategies to mitigate the burden of CTT and improve the patient experience with this therapy. Future studies should also systematically assess patient knowledge about the key components of CTT and chelation using quantitative assessments.

35059711	Standardizing Opioid Prescribing in a Pediatric Hospital: A Quality Improvement Effort.	BACKGROUND: Opioids are indicated for moderate-to-severe pain caused by trauma, ischemia, surgery, cancer and sickle cell disease, and vaso-occlusive episodes (SCD-VOC). There is only limited evidence regarding the appropriate number of doses to prescribe for specific indications. Therefore, we developed and implemented an opioid prescribing algorithm with dosing guidelines for specific procedures and conditions. We aimed to reach and sustain 90% compliance within 1 year of implementation. METHODS: We conducted this quality improvement effort at a pediatric academic quaternary care institution. In 2018, a multidisciplinary team identified the need for a standard approach to opioid prescribing. The algorithm guides prescribers to evaluate the medical history, physical examination, red flags, pain type, and to initiate opioid-sparing interventions before prescribing opioids. Opioid prescriptions written between January 2015 and September 2020 were included. Examples from 2 hospital departments will be highlighted. Control charts for compliance with guidelines and variability in the doses prescribed are presented for selected procedures and conditions. RESULTS: Over 5 years, 83 037 opioid prescriptions in 53 804 unique patients were entered electronically. The encounters with >=1 opioid prescription decreased from 48% to 25% between 2015 and 2019. Compliance with the specific guidelines increased to ~85% for periacetabular osteotomies and SCD-VOC and close to 100% for anterior-cruciate ligament surgery. In all 3 procedures and conditions, variability in the number of doses prescribed decreased significantly. CONCLUSION: We developed an algorithm, guidelines, and a process for improvement. The number of opioid prescriptions and variability in opioid prescribing decreased. Future evaluation of specific initiatives within departments is needed.
35964532	Characteristics and outcomes of stroke hospitalizations in patients with sickle cell disease and moyamoya syndrome.	OBJECTIVES: Stroke is the leading cause of death in patients with Sickle cell disease (SCD). Here, we detail the burden of Moyamoya syndrome (MMS) as a cause of stroke in patients with SCD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A review of SCD-related hospital discharges was conducted utilizing the National Inpatient Sample. Rates of stroke hospitalization, risk factors, procedures, and outcomes were compared between patients with SCD-MMS and SCD alone. Univariate analyses including T-test, Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test, Chi-square were performed to compare risk factors and outcomes. Multivariable regression was used to identify predictors of stroke unique to each population. RESULTS: Stroke occurred in 9.8% of SCD-MMS hospitalizations versus 0.5% of those involving patients with SCD alone (OR = 20.71, p < 0.001). Patients with SCD-MMS developed stroke at younger ages and with fewer comorbidities compared to those with SCD alone. Stroke hospitalizations in SCD-MMS involved a greater number of procedures (90.5% vs. 79.3%, p = 0.007), but were more likely to result in favorable discharge (58.5% vs. 44.2%, p = 0.005). The presence of anemia during hospitalization was a significant risk factor for stroke in both cohorts. Long-term antiplatelet use was protective against stroke (OR = 0.42, p = 0.008) only in the SCD-MMS cohort. CONCLUSIONS: MMS confers a 20-fold increased risk of stroke among patients with SCD and appears to be an important cause of recurrent stroke in this population. Anemia is one of the most significant risk factors for stroke, while antiplatelet use appears to confer a protective benefit.
34090800	Topical Vapocoolant-Associated Vaso-occlusive Event in a 10-year-old with Sickle Cell Disease.	Vapocoolant sprays are convenient forms of cold temperature analgesia. These sprays may not be suitable for all patients with particular concern for patients with sickle cell disease. To prevent any further cases from occurring, we propose adding a more specific cautionary statement to the manufacturer guidelines. We also hope that medical personnel can help patients with sickle cell avoid topical and environmental cold temperature triggers for sickle vaso-occlusive pain and reduce the suffering in this rare disease.

38454604	Autologous Gene Therapy for Hemoglobinopathies: From Bench to Patient's Bedside.	In recent years, a growing number of clinical trials have been initiated to evaluate gene therapy approaches for the treatment of patients with transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia (TDT) and sickle cell disease (SCD). Therapeutic modalities being assessed in these trials utilize different molecular techniques, including lentiviral vectors to add functional copies of the gene encoding the hemoglobin beta subunit in defective cells and CRISPR/Cas9, TALE nuclease (TALEN), and zinc finger nuclease (ZFN) gene editing strategies to either directly address the underlying genetic cause of disease or induce fetal hemoglobin production by gene disruption. Here, we review the mechanisms of action of these various gene addition and gene editing approaches and describe the status of clinical trials designed to evaluate the potentially for these approaches to provide one-time functional cures to patients with TDT and SCD.
35247584	Globin vector regulatory elements are active in early hematopoietic progenitor cells.	The globin genes are archetypal tissue-specific genes that are silent in most tissues but for late-stage erythroblasts upon terminal erythroid differentiation. The transcriptional activation of the beta-globin gene is under the control of proximal and distal regulatory elements located on chromosome 11p15.4, including the beta-globin locus control region (LCR). The incorporation of selected LCR elements in lentiviral vectors encoding beta and beta-like globin genes has enabled successful genetic treatment of the beta-thalassemias and sickle cell disease. However, recent occurrences of benign clonal expansions in thalassemic patients and myelodysplastic syndrome in patients with sickle cell disease call attention to the non-erythroid functions of these powerful vectors. Here we demonstrate that lentivirally encoded LCR elements, in particular HS1 and HS2, can be activated in early hematopoietic cells including hematopoietic stem cells and myeloid progenitors. This activity is position-dependent and results in the transcriptional activation of a nearby reporter gene in these progenitor cell populations. We further show that flanking a globin vector with an insulator can effectively restrain this non-erythroid activity without impairing therapeutic globin expression. Globin lentiviral vectors harboring powerful LCR HS elements may thus expose to the risk of trans-activating cancer-related genes, which can be mitigated by a suitable insulator.
34232993	Gene therapy for sickle cell disease: moving from the bench to the bedside.	Gene therapy as a potential cure for sickle cell disease (SCD) has long been pursued, given that this hemoglobin (Hb) disorder results from a single point mutation. Advances in genomic sequencing have increased the understanding of Hb regulation, and discoveries of molecular tools for genome modification of hematopoietic stem cells have made gene therapy for SCD possible. Gene-addition strategies using gene transfer vectors have been optimized over the past few decades to increase expression of normal or antisickling globins as strategies to ameliorate SCD. Many hurdles had to be addressed before clinical translation, including collecting sufficient stem cells for gene modification, increasing expression of transferred genes to a therapeutic level, and conditioning patients in a safe manner that enabled adequate engraftment of gene-modified cells. The discovery of genome editors that make precise modifications has further advanced the safety and efficacy of gene therapy, and a rapid movement to clinical trial has undoubtedly been supported by lessons learned from optimizing gene-addition strategies. Current gene therapies being tested in clinical trial require significant infrastructure and expertise, given that cells must be harvested from and chemotherapy administered to patients who often have significant organ dysfunction and that gene-modification takes place ex vivo in specialized facilities. For these therapies to realize their full potential, they would have to be portable, safe, and efficient, to make an in vivo-based approach attractive. In addition, adequate resources for SCD screening and access to standardized care are critically important for gene therapy to be a viable treatment option for SCD.

36172983	Comprehensive guide to managing a chronic automated red cell exchange program in sickle cell disease.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and limits both the quality and quantity of life. Transfusion therapy, specifically automated red cell exchange (aRCE), plays a key role in management of SCD and is beneficial for certain indications in the chronic, outpatient setting. The approach to maintain a successful chronic aRCE program for SCD is multifaceted. This review will highlight important considerations including indications for aRCE, patient selection, transfusion medicine pearls, vascular access needs, complications of therapy, aRCE prescription, and therapy optimization. Moreover, the importance of a multidisciplinary approach with frequent communication between the services involved cannot be overstated. Ultimately, the underlying goal of a chronic RCE program is to improve the quality of life and longevity of patients with SCD.
34632580	Extended phenotyping does not preclude the occurrence of delayed haemolytic transfusion reactions in sickle cell disease.	Delayed haemolytic transfusion reaction (DHTR) is a potentially life-threatening complication of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in sickle cell disease (SCD) and is classically induced by reactivation of previously formed antibodies. Improved antigenic matching has reduced alloimmunization and may reduce DHTR risk. We conducted a retrospective cohort study to investigate the incidence rate of DHTR in SCD patients receiving extended matched units (ABO/RhDCcEe/K/Fya /Jkb /S). Occasional transfusion episodes (OTE) between 2011 and 2020 were reviewed for occurrence of DHTR symptoms using four screening criteria: decreased Hb, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), pain, and dark urine. We included 205 patients who received a cumulative number of 580 transfusion episodes of 1866 RBC units. During follow-up, 10 DHTR events were observed. The incidence rate of DHTR was 13 8/1000 OTEs [95% confidence interval (CI): 7 37-22 2], with a cumulative incidence of 15 2% (95% CI: 8 4-24 0%) after 25 patients having received RBC units. One DHTR event was fatal (10%). Symptoms were misdiagnosed in four DHTR events (40%) as other acute SCD complications. Despite a lower incidence rate compared to most other studies, the incidence rate of DHTR in SCD remains high, in spite of extended matching of donor RBCs. Increased awareness of DHTR is of utmost importance to facilitate early diagnosis and, consequently, improve outcome.
32706825	Utilization, financial outcomes and stakeholder perspectives of a re-organized adult sickle cell program.	In 2011 Yale New Haven Hospital, in response to high utilization of acute care services and widespread patient and health care personnel dissatisfaction, set out to improve its care of adults living with sickle cell disease. Re-organization components included recruitment of additional personnel; re-locating inpatients to a single nursing unit; reducing the number of involved providers; personalized care plans for pain management; setting limits upon access to parenteral opioids; and an emphasis upon clinic visits focused upon home management of pain as well as specialty and primary care. Outcomes included dramatic reductions in inpatient days (79%), emergency department visits (63%), and hospitalizations (53%); an increase in outpatient visits (31%); and a decrease in costs (49%). Providers and nurses viewed the re-organization and outcomes positively. Most patients reported improvements in pain control and life style; many patients thought the re-organization process was unfair. Their primary complaint was a lack of shared decision-making. We attribute the contrast in these perspectives to the inherent difficulties of managing recurrent acute and chronic pain with opioids, especially within the context of the imbalance in wellness, power, and privilege between persons living with sickle cell disease, predominantly persons of color and poor socio-economic status, and health care organizations and their personnel.
35856776	Pediatric hematology providers' contraceptive practices for female adolescents and young adults with sickle cell disease: A national survey.	BACKGROUND: Adolescent and young adult (AYA) women with sickle cell disease (SCD) have increased pregnancy-related health risks and are prescribed potentially teratogenic medications, yet limited data are available regarding pediatric SCD provider contraceptive practices. We aimed to assess pediatric hematology providers' beliefs, practices, motivators, and barriers for providing contraceptive care to female AYAs with SCD. METHODS: Guided by the Health Belief Model (HBM), we developed a 25-question, web-based survey to assess practices. Survey links were distributed nationwide to pediatric SCD and/or general hematology providers through their publicly available emails and by request to directors of U.S.-accredited Pediatric Hematology-Oncology fellowship programs for distribution to their SCD providers. Data analysis included descriptive statistics, chi-square analysis, and logistic regression. RESULTS: Of 177 respondents, 160 surveys meeting inclusion criteria were analyzed. Most providers reported counseling (77.5%) and referring female AYA patients for contraception (90.8%), but fewer reported prescribing contraception (41.8%). Proportionally fewer trainees provided counseling compared with established providers (54% vs. 85%, p < .001), with a similar trend for prescribing (p = .05). Prescription practices did not differ significantly by provider beliefs regarding potential teratogenicity of hydroxyurea. Key motivators included patient request and disclosure of sexual activity. Key barriers included inadequate provider training, limited visit time, and perceived patient/parent interest. CONCLUSION: Provider contraceptive practices for female AYAs with SCD varied, especially by provider status. Health beliefs regarding teratogenic potential of hydroxyurea did not correlate with contraceptive practices. Clinical guidelines, provider training, and patient/parent decision-making tools may be tested to assess whether provider contraceptive practices could be improved.
34080441	Acupuncture for chronic pain in adults with sickle cell disease: a mixed-methods pilot study.	OBJECTIVE: Chronic pain is a common symptom experienced among patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Our aims were to assess the feasibility and acceptability of performing acupuncture for the treatment of chronic pain in adults with SCD. METHODS: This was a single-arm, prospective pilot study of six adults with SCD. Participants reported >= 3 months of chronic pain and were > 18 years of age. Per protocol, acupuncture was to be administered twice per week for 5 weeks, for 30 min per session. All treatments were performed in the acupuncture treatment laboratory at the University of Illinois Chicago College of Nursing. Pain intensity, pain interference, and other symptoms were measured at baseline and after the intervention. Participants completed a semi-structured interview and a protocol acceptability questionnaire after the acupuncture intervention. RESULTS: Six participants (mean age 52.5 years, six Black) were enrolled. Although the study was suspended due to COVID-19 and not all participants completed the 10-session protocol, completion rates were high with no missed appointments. One participant did not complete the study due to hospitalization unrelated to acupuncture. No adverse events were reported. At completion of the intervention at 4-5 weeks post-baseline, all participants had reduced pain intensity and pain interference. The mean acceptability score on the protocol acceptability questionnaire was 82%. CONCLUSION: It was feasible and acceptable to implement acupuncture in adults with SCD. This study can be used to guide a larger randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of acupuncture on reducing chronic pain in adults with SCD.Trial registration number: NCT04156399 (ClinicalTrials.gov).
32885834	Adjuvant interventions with opioids for vaso-occlusive crisis in sickle cell disease: A mixed treatment network meta-analysis of randomized controlled clinical trials.	OBJECTIVE: Vaso-occlusive crisis is the most common clinical feature requiring opioid analgesics in patients with sickle cell disease. We conducted a network meta-analysis to compare the drugs that can be used as add-on with opioids for vaso-occlusive crisis. DESIGN: Network meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials. PATIENTS: Sickle cell disease patients with vaso-occlusive crisis receiving adjuvants to opioids for pain management. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A number of patients with complete pain relief and pain scores assessed either by visual ana-log or by a numerical rating scale were the primary outcomes. Adverse events and dose of opioids (in morphine equiva-lents) for pain alleviation between the treatment arms were the secondary outcome measures. RESULTS: Eleven studies evaluating the addition of ketorolac, magnesium sulfate, ketoprofen, ibuprofen, methadone, inhalational nitric oxide, methylprednisolone, and arginine with morphine were obtained. The pooled analysis showed a favorable effect in the pain reduction for the additions of arginine {-2 [-3.39, -0.61]} and ibuprofen {-1.7 [-3.26, -0.14]} with morphine. Arginine has high probability of being the "best" in the pool followed by ibuprofen. No significant differ-ences were observed in the risk of adverse events {ketoprofen-0.84 [0.42, 1.65]; magnesium sulfate-1.81 [0.64, 5.81]; and arginine-2.08 [0.18, 24.31]}. A significant lower dose of opioid was required when given adjunctive to argin-ine, inhalational nitric oxide, and methylprednisolone. CONCLUSION: We observed that arginine and ibuprofen could produce additional analgesic effects when combined with morphine in vaso-occlusive crisis.
37973947	Clonal selection of hematopoietic stem cells after gene therapy for sickle cell disease.	Gene therapy (GT) provides a potentially curative treatment option for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD); however, the occurrence of myeloid malignancies in GT clinical trials has prompted concern, with several postulated mechanisms. Here, we used whole-genome sequencing to track hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from six patients with SCD at pre- and post-GT time points to map the somatic mutation and clonal landscape of gene-modified and unmodified HSCs. Pre-GT, phylogenetic trees were highly polyclonal and mutation burdens per cell were elevated in some, but not all, patients. Post-GT, no clonal expansions were identified among gene-modified or unmodified cells; however, an increased frequency of potential driver mutations associated with myeloid neoplasms or clonal hematopoiesis (DNMT3A- and EZH2-mutated clones in particular) was observed in both genetically modified and unmodified cells, suggesting positive selection of mutant clones during GT. This work sheds light on HSC clonal dynamics and the mutational landscape after GT in SCD, highlighting the enhanced fitness of some HSCs harboring pre-existing driver mutations. Future studies should define the long-term fate of mutant clones, including any contribution to expansions associated with myeloid neoplasms.
35175224	The hematopoietic saga of clonality in sickle cell disease.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is associated with an increased risk of vascular-occlusive events and of leukemia. Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) may increase both risks. In turn, physiologic abnormalities in SCD may modify the incidence and/or distribution of genetic alterations in CH. In a recent issue of the JCI, Liggett et al. found no difference in CH rate between individuals with versus without SCD. Here we contextualize this report and discuss the complex interplay between CH and SCD with particular attention to consequences for emerging gene therapies. We further consider the limitations in our current understanding of these topics that must be addressed in order to optimize therapeutic strategies for SCD.
36781119	Preventive treatment of unruptured intracranial aneurysms in adult patients with sickle cell anemia: A cohort study.	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Intracranial aneurysms are frequent in patients with sickle cell anemia, while subarachnoid hemorrhage is a major cause of death and disability in young adult patients. Several characteristics, such as younger age and smaller size at rupture, may incline therapeutic decision towards exclusion treatments. Clinical guidelines on treatment of unruptured intracranial aneurysms in this population are still missing. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of the treatment of unruptured intracranial aneurysm in patients with sickle cell anemia, using an adapted hematological preparation regimen. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Adult patients with sickle cell anemia and treated unruptured aneurysms by endovascular therapy or neurosurgery were included in this retrospective cohort study. Treatment decision was reached after multi-disciplinary assessment. A pre-operative blood transfusion protocol was undertaken targeting a HbS below 30%. Demographic data, hematological preparation parameters and clinical and radiological outcomes were documented. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Twenty-five procedures were performed in 18 patients encompassing 19 aneurysms treated by embolization and 6 by surgery. Median age at treatment was 34 years-old and median aneurysm dome size was 4.4 mm. Immediate aneurysm exclusion rate was 85.7% after endovascular therapy and 100% after neurosurgery. Median follow-up was 6 months, with all patients being asymptomatic at last follow-up. Two transitory ischemic neurological deficits, as well as four cases of iodine-induced encephalopathy were identified after embolization. No complication occurred after surgery. Endovascular therapy by coiling and neurosurgical treatment of unruptured intracranial aneurysms appears to be safe in patients with sickle cell anemia and should be considered given the specific hemorrhagic risk observed in this population. A rigorous hematological preparation, associated with a dedicated peri-operative protocol and an adequate therapeutic strategy are essential prerequisites.
33362271	Clinical characteristics of paediatric autoimmune hepatitis at a referral hospital in Sub Saharan Africa.	BACKGROUND: Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a progressive inflammatory liver disease of unknown aetiology. The number of reported AIH cases is increasing in the developed countries but the same cannot be said about sub Saharan Africa (SSA). Paediatric AIH diagnosis is usually missed and patients present with decompensated liver disease. Our study highlights the clinical profile of paediatric AIH cases at a referral hospital in Ghana. METHODS: This is a retrospective review of all cases of children diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis at the gastroenterology clinic in Korle Bu Teaching Hospital, Accra, Ghana. Data was extracted from the patients' records from April 2016 to October 2019. These children were diagnosed based on the presence of autoantibodies, elevated immunoglobulin G and histologic presence of interphase hepatitis with the exclusion of hepatitis A, B, C and E depending on their clinical presentation, Wilson's disease, HIV, Schistosomiasis and sickle cell disease. RESULTS: Thirteen patients aged between 5 years to 13 years with a mean age of 10 years were diagnosed with AIH. All the patients had type 1 AIH with majority 8 (61.5%) being females. Most of the children presented with advanced liver disease with complications. Three patients had other associated autoimmune diseases. The patients were treated with prednisolone with or without azathioprine depending on the severity of the liver disease. CONCLUSION: Majority of paediatric AIH presents with advanced liver disease. There is the need for early detection to change the natural history of AIH in SSA.
38506484	Using the daily rate of rise in hemoglobin S to manage RBC depletion/exchange treatment in sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Red blood cell exchange is often used prophylactically in patients with sickle cell disease, with the goal to maintain hemoglobin S (HbS) below a target threshold level. We reviewed whether the daily "rate of rise" (RoR) in HbS that occurs between procedures can be used for patient management. For some patients not achieving their HbS goals despite efficient exchanges, the post-procedure hematocrit (Hct) target is increased to potentially suppress HbS production. This case series explores the utility of this approach, other clinical uses of the daily RoR in HbS, and the factors that influence it. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 660 procedures from 24 patients undergoing prophylactic RBC depletion/exchange procedures were included. Laboratory values and clinical parameters were collected and used to calculate the daily RoR in HbS. Factors such as Hct or medications that might influence the RoR in HbS were evaluated. RESULTS: The RoR in HbS varied widely between patients but remained relatively stable within individuals. Surprisingly, this value was not significantly influenced by changes in post-procedure Hct or concurrent hydroxyurea use. A patient's average RoR in HbS effectively predicted the pre-procedure HbS at the following visit (R2  = 0.65). DISCUSSION: The RoR in HbS is a relatively consistent parameter for individual patients that is unaffected by medication use or procedural Hct targets and may be useful in determining intervals between procedures.
32614150	The association between timely opioid administration and hospitalization in children with sickle cell disease presenting to the emergency department in acute pain.	INTRODUCTION: The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute guidelines for sickle cell disease (SCD) pain crisis management recommend opioids within 60 minutes of emergency department (ED) registration and every 30 minutes thereafter until acute pain is managed. These guidelines are based on expert opinion without published, supporting data. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between timely ED opioid administration and hospitalization rates in children with SCD. METHODS: Retrospective cohort of children presenting to a children's hospital ED with SCD pain between January 1, 2014, and April 30, 2018. Visits were extracted using ICD codes, chief complaints, and receipt of at least one opioid, and then reviewed to confirm the visit was an uncomplicated pain crisis. The primary outcome was hospitalization, yes or no. Generalized estimating equations were used to determine adjusted odds of hospitalization for the timely administration of initial and second doses of opioids. RESULTS: Of the 902 eligible visits, 368 (40.8%) resulted in hospitalization. The mean (SD) age was 11.9 (+- 5.2) years. The first opioid was administered within 60 minutes of arrival in 601 (66.6%) visits. The second opioid was administered within 30 minutes of the first in 84 (12.3%) visits. Receipt of the first opioid within 60 minutes of arrival was not associated with decreased hospitalization (1.30 [0.96-1.76]). However, receipt of the second dose within 30 minutes of the first was associated with decreased hospitalization (0.56 [0.33-0.94]). CONCLUSION: This study suggests an association between children with SCD receiving a second dose within 30 minutes of the first opioid dose and decreased hospitalizations.
38285418	Priapism in a Young Adult With Sickle Cell Disease.	This article presents a case study focusing on priapism in a patient with sickle cell disease, with repeated emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations. The patient was successfully identified and treated by the ED nurse practitioner (NP) with aspiration of the corpus cavernosum. Priapism is a persistent penile erection that continues for an extended time. There is some argument about what that length of time is, but generally, the consensus is more than 4 hr beyond sexual stimulation or unrelated to sexual stimulation or sexual interest (Bivalacqua et al., 2022). Priapism is a fairly common but underrecognized complication of sickle cell disease. It represents a urological emergency in which timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment are vital to preserving penile tissue and sexual function. The diagnosis is made clinically with a comprehensive history, physical examination, and appropriate laboratory test values. Initial management can be conservative with hydration and analgesics or, if necessary, more invasive with needle aspiration to promote detumescence. Permanent tissue damage or erectile dysfunction can result if priapism is unrecognized, untreated, or not treated immediately. The NP plays an integral role in treating and preventing permanent damage. Patient education should focus on instructions for preventing priapism and managing episodes at home.
37229519	Using an individualized pain management plan for African American adults with sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: The increased lifespan of individuals having sickle cell disease (SCD) causes an overall increase in hospitalizations and more instances in which pain may not be well controlled. LOCAL PROBLEM: The mainstay treatment for severe pain is opioids and the underlying cause. Laws affecting opioid prescribing, implicit bias, racial inequity, poor research funding, and lack of knowledge contribute to poor patient outcomes. METHOD: Data were collected retrospectively using electronic medical record data from before and after the intervention. INTERVENTION: The individualized pain management plan (IPMP) was initiated in collaboration with the patient, pain nurse practitioner (NP), and hematologist. RESULT: The mean length of stay for the traditional pain management plan (TPMP) was 7.89 days compared with 5.66 days for the IPMP, with a mean difference of 2.23 days, t = 2.278, p = .024 (p < .05). There was a decrease in the admission of the individuals with the IPMP, with 25% readmitted within 30 days of discharge, versus 59.0% who were readmitted using the TPMP. Chi-square showed statistical significance (chi2 = 61.667, p = .000) in using nonpharmacological interventions with the IPMP group. CONCLUSION: The IPMP with a patient-centered approach did improve patient outcomes for African American adults living with SCD.
38511273	Chronic kidney disease and outcomes in hospitalized sickle cell disease patients: A National Inpatient Sample analysis.	OBJECTIVES: To examine the association between chronic kidney disease (CKD) and outcomes in sickle cell disease (SCD) patients. METHODS: Patients >=18 years with SCD in the National Inpatient Sample database between 2016 and 2018 were identified using ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes. A 1:1 propensity-score matched analysis was performed to compare in-hospital outcomes of patients with and without CKD. RESULTS: Of the 366 240 SCD admissions, 19 365 (5.3%) had CKD. The CKD group had higher odds of in-hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR] 2.59, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.63-4.12, p = <.01), blood transfusion (OR 1.67, 95% CI: 1.47-1.90, p < .01), mechanical ventilation (OR 2.20, 95% CI: 1.56-3.12, p = <.01), sepsis (OR 1.75, 95% CI: 1.46-2.10, p < .01), incurred higher costs ($53 255 vs. $47 294, p < .001), but had lower odds of acute chest syndrome (OR 0.71, 95% CI: 0.54-0.95, p = 0.02) and pulmonary embolism (OR 0.45, 95% CI: 0.31-0.67, p < .01). CONCLUSIONS: CKD was associated with higher mortality, higher costs, blood transfusion, sepsis, and mechanical ventilation in SCD patients. Further studies are needed to explore the reasons for the reduced odds of pulmonary embolism and acute chest syndrome.
35917483	Meteorological parameters and hospitalizations of patients with sickle cell anemia: a 20-year retrospective study in Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.	To investigate the influence of climate on hospitalizations of sickle cell anemia (SCA) adults and children, we analyzed the health and meteorological parameters from a metropolis (1999-2018). 1462 hospitalizations were coded for SCA patients in crisis (M:F = 715:747) and 1354 hospitalizations for SCA patients without crisis (M:F = 698:656) [age = 22.9 vs 15.2 years and duration of hospitalization (DoH) = 5.7 vs 4.4 days, respectively,]. More hospitalizations were for adults than children in crisis, and for children than adults without crisis. More children and adults were hospitalized in winter andspring than in summer and autumn     Hospitalizations correlated positively with humidity (lag -5), maximum pressure (lag -2), mean pressure (lag -2), and thermal amplitude (lag -2), and negatively with maximum temperature (lag -3). DoH positively correlated with minimum temperature (lag -4). Understanding these complex associations would induce attitudinal/behavioral modifications among patients and their caregivers.
31724541	Serum Folate Levels in Patients with Chronic Hemolytic Anemia on Regular Folic Acid Supplementation Before and After Dose Modification.	OBJECTIVE: In light of the recommendation of folic acid supplementation in chronic hemolytic anemia, with possible supratherapeutic dosing and associated side effects, we performed this study to investigate serum folate levels in children with chronic hemolytic anemia. METHODS: Phase 1 was a cross-sectional study of 134 patients in the Pediatric Hematology service, documenting daily dosage and performing serum folate levels. In phase 2, we reduced the dose to 1 mg for 148 patients and repeated the testing after six months. RESULTS: We found very high serum folate levels with Phase 1, with 93.2% above the upper level of normal. In Phase 2, values remained high with 42.5% above the acceptable upper limit. CONCLUSION: Doses of folic acid given to sickle cell and thalassemia patients exceed their actual needs. This should be re-evaluated to strike a balance between benefit and harm, with close monitoring of serum folate levels.
33948577	Preclinical evaluation for engraftment of CD34+ cells gene-edited at the sickle cell disease locus in xenograft mouse and non-human primate models.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is caused by a 20A > T mutation in the beta-globin gene. Genome-editing technologies have the potential to correct the SCD mutation in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), producing adult hemoglobin while simultaneously eliminating sickle hemoglobin. Here, we developed high-efficiency viral vector-free non-footprint gene correction in SCD CD34+ cells with electroporation to deliver SCD mutation-targeting guide RNA, Cas9 endonuclease, and 100-mer single-strand donor DNA encoding intact beta-globin sequence, achieving therapeutic-level gene correction at DNA (~30%) and protein (~80%) levels. Gene-edited SCD CD34+ cells contributed corrected cells 6 months post-xenograft mouse transplant without off-target delta-globin editing. We then developed a rhesus beta-to-betas-globin gene conversion strategy to model HSC-targeted genome editing for SCD and demonstrate the engraftment of gene-edited CD34+ cells 10-12 months post-transplant in rhesus macaques. In summary, gene-corrected CD34+ HSCs are engraftable in xenograft mice and non-human primates. These findings are helpful in designing HSC-targeted gene correction trials.
37391656	Sickle Cell Crises in Pregnancy: Fetal and Neonatal Implications.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common inherited condition worldwide. In the United States, SCD affects 100,000 births every year, mostly persons of African descent. In SCD, red blood cells assume a sickle shape when deoxygenated. This leads to the occlusion of small blood vessels and decreased oxygenated blood flow, resulting in ischemic and thrombotic injury to various organs, which further leads to organ dysfunction. In pregnancy, patients with SCD are at an increased risk of vaso-occlusive crises, which further increases the risks of maternal, fetal, and neonatal morbidity and mortality.
37092306	Revisiting the benefits of isovolemic hemodilution red cell exchange for sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Isovolemic hemodilution red cell exchange (IHD-RCE) is a modified form of the standard red cell exchange (STD-RCE), intended to reduce red cell requirements in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). This retrospective crossover analysis of nine patients aims to add to the limited existing literature on IHD-RCE and address the equipoise regarding whether the benefits of (a) decreased RBC usage per exchange and (b) increased interprocedure interval (via lower fraction of cells remaining, FCR) can be observed at the same time, in the same patient. METHODS: At a single center, we identified 37 patients with SCD undergoing chronic RCE between 2014 and 2021. We excluded those patients who did not have at least six consecutive procedures of each type (STD- and IHD-RCE), arriving at nine patients for analysis. RESULTS: When using greater decreases in hematocrit than previously published, we did not find that IHD-RCE resulted in any clinically apparent adverse events. We did find greater decreases in diastolic blood pressure and increases in heart rate in some patients, as compared to STD-RCE. After correcting for total blood volume, seven of the nine patients had significantly reduced red cell requirements with each IHD-RCE. Because the pattern of achieving a lower FCR than programmed was seen to an equal extent with both IHD-RCE and STD-RCE, none of the nine patients showed any statistical difference in actual FCR between procedure types. DISCUSSION: Our data do not support the observation of both IHD-RCE benefits, decreased red cell usage per exchange and lower FCR/increased interprocedure interval, simultaneously.
32716940	Spatial and temporal patterns of nitric oxide diffusion and degradation drive emergent cerebrovascular dynamics.	Nitric oxide (NO) is a gaseous signaling molecule that plays an important role in neurovascular coupling. NO produced by neurons diffuses into the smooth muscle surrounding cerebral arterioles, driving vasodilation. However, the rate of NO degradation in hemoglobin is orders of magnitude higher than in brain tissue, though how this might impact NO signaling dynamics is not completely understood. We used simulations to investigate how the spatial and temporal patterns of NO generation and degradation impacted dilation of a penetrating arteriole in cortex. We found that the spatial location of NO production and the size of the vessel both played an important role in determining its responsiveness to NO. The much higher rate of NO degradation and scavenging of NO in the blood relative to the tissue drove emergent vascular dynamics. Large vasodilation events could be followed by post-stimulus constrictions driven by the increased degradation of NO by the blood, and vasomotion-like 0.1-0.3 Hz oscillations could also be generated. We found that these dynamics could be enhanced by elevation of free hemoglobin in the plasma, which occurs in diseases such as malaria and sickle cell anemia, or following blood transfusions. Finally, we show that changes in blood flow during hypoxia or hyperoxia could be explained by altered NO degradation in the parenchyma. Our simulations suggest that many common vascular dynamics may be emergent phenomena generated by NO degradation by the blood or parenchyma.
35072359	Successful use of veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for acute chest syndrome in a child with sickle cell disease and SARS-CoV-2.	Children with sickle cell disease (SCD) are at increased risk for severe illness due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We describe the successful native lung recovery of a child with SCD referred for lung transplant (LTx) evaluation who was on prolonged veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO). He initially presented with acute chest syndrome complicated by SARS-CoV-2 infection that ultimately required dual-lumen, single bicaval VV-ECMO cannulation for respiratory support. Despite the increased risk of hemolysis and thrombosis from SCD and SARS-CoV-2 infection, he was successfully supported on VV-ECMO for 71 days without complications leading to native lung recovery with meticulous management of his SCD therapy. This report provides new insight on our approach to VV-ECMO support in a child with SCD and SARS-CoV-2 infection. With a successful outcome, the patient has returned home but still on mechanical ventilation with LTx still an option if he is not eventually liberated from invasive respiratory support.
34274957	Matched related hematopoietic cell transplant for sickle cell disease with alemtuzumab: the Texas Children's Hospital experience.	Serotherapeutic agents facilitate engraftment and prevent graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) following hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Anti-thymocyte globulin is generally added to conditioning chemotherapy for matched related donor transplant (MRD-HCT) for sickle cell disease (SCD). Alemtuzumab, however, is appealing due to its broad lymphocyte killing that may achieve very low rejection and GVHD rates. To assess the impact of alemtuzumab in MRD-HCT for SCD, we retrospectively reviewed transplant-related outcomes and markers of immunity in 38 consecutive patients at Texas Children's Hospital having received myeloablative conditioning with alemtuzumab. Median follow-up was 4.8 years (range: 0.2-17). All patients engrafted. Donor chimerism was mixed in 47.1% of patients at >=2-years. Donor chimerism <50% was uncommon (n = 2). One patient with low myeloid chimerism (19%) had sickle-related hemolysis at 10-years. Incidence of acute GVHD grade II-IV (5.3%) and extensive chronic GVHD (2.8%) was very low. Five-year event-free survival (EFS) and composite chronic GVHD-EFS were excellent at 94.7% (95% CI: 80.3, 98.6) and 89.2% (95% CI: 73.7, 95.8), respectively. Infections did not contribute to mortality although cytomegalovirus reactivation occurred commonly in the first 3 months after transplant. Our data suggest potential for alemtuzumab in myeloablative transplant for children with SCD although further evaluation in older patients and with unrelated donors is warranted.
31951361	Predicting hospitalizations from electronic health record data.	OBJECTIVES: Electronic health record (EHR) data have become increasingly available and may help inform clinical prediction. However, predicting hospitalizations among a diverse group of patients remains difficult. We sought to use EHR data to create and internally validate a predictive model for clinical use in predicting hospitalizations. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective observational cohort study. METHODS: We analyzed EHR data in patients 18 years or older seen at Atrius Health from June 2013 to November 2015. We selected variables among patient demographics, clinical diagnoses, medications, and prior utilization to train a logistic regression model predicting any hospitalization within 6 months and validated the model using a separate validation set. We performed sensitivity analysis on model performance using combinations of EHR-derived, claims-derived, or both EHR- and claims-derived data. RESULTS: After exclusions, 363,855 patient-months were included for analysis, representing 185,388 unique patients. The strongest features included sickle cell anemia (odds ratio [OR], 52.72), lipidoses and glycogenosis (OR, 8.44), heart transplant (OR, 6.12), and age 76 years or older (OR, 5.32). Model testing showed that EHR-only data had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.84 (95% CI, 0.838-0.853), which was similar to the claims-only data (AUC, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.831-0.848) and combined claims and EHR data (AUC, 0.846; 95% CI, 0.838-0.853). CONCLUSIONS: Prediction models using EHR-only, claims-only, and combined data had similar predictive value and demonstrated strong discrimination for which patients will be hospitalized in the ensuing 6 months.
32507420	Integrative approaches to treating pain in sickle cell disease: Pre-clinical and clinical evidence.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder characterized by hemolysis, end-organ damage, inflammation, and pain. Recurrent and unpredictable episodes of acute pain due to vaso-occlusive crises are a unique feature of SCD. Many patients also develop lifelong chronic pain. Opioids are the primary method of pain treatment in SCD; however, continued use is associated with several adverse effects. Integrative approaches to treating pain in SCD are increasingly being explored to prevent the side effects associated with opioids. In this review, we highlight the mechanisms of pain in SCD and describe mechanism-based integrative approaches for treating pain.
32614473	Preoperative blood transfusions for sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the commonest severe monogenic disorders in the world, due to the inheritance of two abnormal haemoglobin (beta globin) genes. SCD can cause severe pain, significant end-organ damage, pulmonary complications, and premature death. Surgical interventions are more common in people with SCD, and occur at much younger ages than in the general population. Blood transfusions are frequently used prior to surgery and several regimens are used but there is no consensus over the best method or the necessity of transfusion in specific surgical cases. This is an update of a Cochrane Review. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether there is evidence that preoperative blood transfusion in people with SCD undergoing elective or emergency surgery reduces mortality and perioperative or sickle cell-related serious adverse events. To compare the effectiveness of different transfusion regimens (aggressive or conservative) if preoperative transfusions are indicated in people with SCD. SEARCH METHODS: We searched for relevant trials in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the Transfusion Evidence Library (from 1980), and ongoing trial databases; all searches current to 28 January 2020 We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register: 19 September 2019. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing preoperative blood transfusion regimens to different regimens or no transfusion in people with SCD undergoing elective or emergency surgery. There was no restriction by outcomes examined, language or publication status. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility and the risk of bias and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: Three trials with 990 participants were eligible for inclusion in the review. There were no ongoing trials identified. These trials were conducted between 1988 and 2011. The majority of people included had haemoglobin (Hb) SS SCD. The majority of surgical procedures were considered low or intermediate risk for developing sickle cell-related complications. Aggressive versus simple red blood cell transfusions One trial (551 participants) compared an aggressive transfusion regimen (decreasing sickle haemoglobin to less than 30%) to a simple transfusion regimen (increasing haemoglobin to 100 g/L). This trial re-randomised participants and therefore quantitative analysis was only possible on two subsets of data: participants undergoing cholecystectomy (230 participants); and participants undergoing tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy surgeries (107 participants). Data were not combined as we do not know if any participant received both surgeries. Overall, the quality of the evidence was very low across different outcomes according to GRADE methodology. This was due to the trial being at high risk of bias primarily due to lack of blinding, indirectness and the outcome estimates being imprecise. Cholecystectomy subgroup results are reported in the abstract. Results for both subgroups were similar. There was no difference in all-cause mortality between people receiving aggressive transfusions and those receiving conservative transfusions. No deaths occurred in either subgroup. There were no differences between the aggressive transfusion group and conservative transfusion group in the number of people developing:   an acute chest syndrome, risk ratio (RR) 0.84 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38 to 1.84) (one trial, 230 participants, very low-quality evidence);   vaso-occlusive crisis, risk ratio 0.30 (95% CI 0.09 to 1.04) (one trial, 230 participants, very low quality evidence);   serious infection, risk ratio 1.75 (95% CI 0.59 to 5.18) (one trial, 230 participants, very low-quality evidence);   any perioperative complications, RR 0.75 (95% CI 0.36 to 1.55) (one trial, 230 participants, very low-quality evidence);   a transfusion-related complication, RR 1.85 (95% CI 0.89 to 3.88) (one trial, 230 participants, very low-quality evidence). Preoperative transfusion versus no preoperative transfusion Two trials (434 participants) compared a preoperative transfusion plus standard care to a group receiving standard care. Overall, the quality of the evidence was low to very low across different outcomes according to GRADE methodology. This was due to the trials being at high risk of bias due to lack of blinding, and outcome estimates being imprecise. One trial was stopped early because more people in the no transfusion arm developed an acute chest syndrome. There was no difference in all-cause mortality between people receiving preoperative transfusions and those receiving no preoperative transfusions (two trials, 434 participants, no deaths occurred). There was significant heterogeneity between the two trials in the number of people developing an acute chest syndrome, a meta-analysis was therefore not performed. One trial showed a reduced number of people developing acute chest syndrome between people receiving preoperative transfusions and those receiving no preoperative transfusions, risk ratio 0.11 (95% confidence interval 0.01 to 0.80) (65 participants), whereas the other trial did not, RR 4.81 (95% CI 0.23 to 99.61) (369 participants). There were no differences between the preoperative transfusion groups and the groups without preoperative transfusion in the number of people developing:   a vaso-occlusive crisis, Peto odds ratio (OR) 1.91 (95% confidence interval 0.61 to 6.04) (two trials, 434 participants, very low-quality evidence).   a serious infection, Peto OR 1.29 (95% CI 0.29 to 5.71) (two trials, 434 participants, very low-quality evidence);   any perioperative complications, RR 0.24 (95% CI 0.03 to 2.05) (one trial, 65 participants, low-quality evidence). There was an increase in the number of people developing circulatory overload in those receiving preoperative transfusions compared to those not receiving preoperative transfusions in one of the two trials, and no events were seen in the other trial (no meta-analysis performed). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence from randomised trials to determine whether conservative preoperative blood transfusion is as effective as aggressive preoperative blood transfusion in preventing sickle-related or surgery-related complications in people with HbSS disease. There is very low quality evidence that preoperative blood transfusion may prevent development of acute chest syndrome. Due to lack of evidence this review cannot comment on management for people with HbSC or HbSbeta+ disease or for those with high baseline haemoglobin concentrations.

38319834	Should Intravenous Fluids Be Administered During Hospitalizations for Sickle-Cell Disease?	Intravenous Fluids for Sickle-Cell DiseaseA 30-year-old woman with sickle-cell disease presents with diffuse pain in her arms, legs, and back. She has had frequent vaso-occlusive episodes, and this episode feels similar to previous ones. She is admitted for treatment, including with intravenous pain medications. Should she also receive intravenous fluids?
36310401	Hypoxic storage of donor red cells preserves deformability after exposure to plasma from adults with sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Red cell (RBC) transfusions are beneficial for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), but ex vivo studies suggest that inflamed plasma from patients with SCD during crises may damage these RBCs, diminishing their potential efficacy. The hypoxic storage of RBCs may improve transfusion efficacy by minimizing the storage lesion. We tested the hypotheses that (1) The donor RBCs exposed to the plasma of patients in crisis would have lower deformability and higher hemolysis than those exposed to non-crisis plasma, and (2) hypoxic storage, compared to standard storage, of donor RBCs could preserve deformability and reduce hemolysis. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: 18 SCD plasma samples from patients who had severe acute-phase symptoms (A-plasma; n = 9) or were at a steady-state (S = plasma; n = 9) were incubated with 16 RBC samples from eight units that were stored either under conventional(CRBC) or hypoxic(HRBC) conditions. Hemolysis and microcapillary deformability assays of these RBCs were analyzed using linear mixed-effect models after each sample was incubated in patient plasma overnight at 37 C RESULTS: Relative deformability was 0.036 higher (p < 0.0001) in HRBC pairs compared to CRBC pairs regardless of plasma type. Mean donor RBC hemolysis was 0.33% higher after incubation with A-plasma compared to S-plasma either with HRBC or CRBC (p = 0.04). HRBCs incubated with steady-state patient plasma demonstrated the highest deformability and lowest hemolysis. CONCLUSION: Hypoxic storage significantly influenced RBC deformability. Patient condition significantly influenced post-incubation hemolysis. Together, HRBCs in steady-state plasma maximized donor red cell ex vivo function and survival.
36400543	Genotyping and the Future of Transfusion in Sickle Cell Disease.	Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) have a high rate of red cell alloimmunization, which increases morbidity and mortality. Reasons for this susceptibility are multifactorial, but differences in antigen frequency between donors and recipients are one of the modifiable risk factors. Here, we evaluate the benefits of red cell molecular antigen-typing for both patients with SCD and their donors and describe how results from these critical tests could be used to enhance patient safety.
34389204	Systematic RHD genotyping in Brazilians reveals a high frequency of partial D in transfused patients serologically typed as weak D.	BACKGROUND: The discrimination between weak D types and partial D can be of clinical importance because carriers of partial D antigen may develop anti-D when transfused with D-positive red blood cell units. The aim of this study was to determine by molecular analysis the type of D variants among Brazilian patients requiring transfusions with serologic weak D phenotypes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Samples from 87 patients (53 with sickle cell disease, 10 with thalassemia and 24 with myelodysplastic syndrome), serologic typed as weak D by manual tube indirect antiglobulin test or gel test were first RHD genotyped by using the RHD BeadChip Kit (BioArray, Immucor). Sanger sequencing was performed when necessary. RESULTS: RHD molecular analysis revealed 32 (36.8 %) variant RHD alleles encoding weak D phenotypes and 55 (63.2 %) alleles encoding partial D antigens. RHD variant alleles were present in the homozygous state or as a single RHD allele, one variant RHD allele associated with the RHDPsi allele, or two different variant RHD alleles in compound heterozygosity with each other in 70 patients, 4 patients and 13 patients, respectively. Alloanti-D was found in 9 (16.4 %) cases with RHD alleles predicting a partial D. DISCUSSION: The frequency of partial D was higher than weak D types in Brazilian patients serologically typed as weak D, showing the importance to differentiate weak D types and partial D in transfused patients to establish a transfusion policy recommendation.
37488061	Haematopoietic stem cell mobilisation followed by high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation for patients with sickle cell disease and myeloma.	
34898140	Acute Myeloid Leukemia Case after Gene Therapy for Sickle Cell Disease.	Gene therapy with LentiGlobin for sickle cell disease (bb1111, lovotibeglogene autotemcel) consists of autologous transplantation of a patient's hematopoietic stem cells transduced with the BB305 lentiviral vector that encodes the betaA-T87Q-globin gene. Acute myeloid leukemia developed in a woman approximately 5.5 years after she had received LentiGlobin for sickle cell disease as part of the initial cohort (Group A) of the HGB-206 study. An analysis of peripheral-blood samples revealed that blast cells contained a BB305 lentiviral vector insertion site. The results of an investigation of causality indicated that the leukemia was unlikely to be related to vector insertion, given the location of the insertion site, the very low transgene expression in blast cells, and the lack of an effect on expression of surrounding genes. Several somatic mutations predisposing to acute myeloid leukemia were present after diagnosis, which suggests that patients with sickle cell disease are at increased risk for hematologic malignant conditions after transplantation, most likely because of a combination of risks associated with underlying sickle cell disease, transplantation procedure, and inadequate disease control after treatment.

35679148	Safety and Acceptance of Acupuncture and Acupressure in Children, Adolescents, and Young Adults Undergoing Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant.	BACKGROUND: Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is associated with significant morbidity and high symptom burden including mucositis pain, nausea, and vomiting. There is little documentation in the literature regarding acupuncture or acupressure for children undergoing HSCT. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the safety and acceptance of acupuncture and acupressure in children undergoing HSCT in a large tertiary care children's hospital. METHODS: This is a descriptive retrospective study that evaluated 80 admissions to the HSCT unit over a 24-month period. Every child admitted for HSCT was offered acupuncture or acupressure as part of their care. RESULTS: Of 80 patients, 46 were male patients (ages range, 0-32 years; mean, 8 years). Diagnoses include leukemia/lymphoma, sickle cell disease, aplastic anemia, neuroblastoma, and other metabolic, other solid tumor, or other hematologic disorders. Both allogenic and autologous were represented. Sixty-six patients (82.5%) agreed to treatment with acupuncture, acupressure, or both. There were no adverse effects or safety concerns noted. Symptoms addressed by acupuncture or acupressure included pain from mucositis, nausea, constipation, diarrhea, anxiety, insomnia, and general wellness or healing. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that acupuncture and acupressure are well accepted by children and their families admitted for HSCT and are safe even when performed in the first 4 weeks following transplant when the patient is likely to have thrombocytopenia. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: These findings suggest that there may be more therapies for patients undergoing HSCT to help with symptom control.
31688620	Inpatient Ordering of Home Hydroxyurea by Residents for Hospitalized Patients With Sickle Cell Disease.	BACKGROUND: Hydroxyurea is a well-established disease-modifying medication for sickle cell disease (SCD). At some institutions, hydroxyurea can only be ordered by "chemotherapy-certified" providers which may not include pediatric resident physicians. METHODS: We conducted a survey of 39 American pediatric hospitals regarding their policy on resident hydroxyurea ordering for SCD. Our institution changed its policy in June 2016 to allow residents to order hydroxyurea for hospitalized patients with SCD who were already on hydroxyurea at home. We conducted a retrospective review of the medical records of a random sample of patients with SCD on hydroxyurea admitted the year before and the year after this policy change. RESULTS: In our national survey, 51% of surveyed hospitals allowed residents to order hydroxyurea, 19% required a second signature, and 30% did not allow residents to order hydroxyurea. In our institutional study, patients after the policy change were significantly more likely to have received their home hydroxyurea by hospital day 1: before 62/90 (69%) versus after 105/119 (88%), P=0.0005. The proportion of patients who inappropriately received hydroxyurea was very low in both groups: before 1/91 (1%) versus after 3/126 (2%), P=0.64, with no serious adverse clinical events due to inappropriate hydroxyurea administration. CONCLUSIONS: Considerable national variation in practice currently exists in regards to resident hydroxyurea ordering hospital policies. A policy allowing residents to order hydroxyurea significantly increased the likelihood of a patient receiving hydroxyurea while hospitalized with no significant increase in inappropriate hydroxyurea administration. Resident hydroxyurea ordering seems safe and beneficial.

33974588	Maintenance of an Immunogenic Response to Pneumococcal Vaccination in Children With Sickle Cell Disease.	Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) are at increased risk for invasive pneumococcal disease because of splenic dysfunction. To mitigate this risk, patients are protected with prophylactic penicillin until completion of pneumococcal vaccination series. The objective of this study was to assess the maintenance of a protective immune response to pneumococcal vaccination in children with SCD. A retrospective review was conducted between June 2019 and June 2020 of all patients with SCD patients for whom it had been 5+-1 year since completion of PPSV23 vaccination series. A total of 41 patients were analyzed. The majority of children (68%) were able to maintain an adequate immune response. There was no identifiable disease characteristic associated with maintenance of an appropriate immunogenic response. This study finds that patients with SCD are able to maintain an adequate immune response at the 5+-1 year time point from completion of PPSV23 vaccination series. Similarly, patients were not found to have an increased rate of invasive pneumococcal disease even if not meeting criteria for adequate pneumococcal serum titer levels. Maintenance of pneumococcal titers suggests that there may not be a need for revaccination at the 5-year time point in this patient population.
36485115	Long-term health outcomes following curative therapies for sickle cell disease.	Treatment options for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) continue to rapidly expand and evolve. The goal of therapies such as an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), gene therapy, and gene editing is to cure rather than control SCD. The benefits of these therapies must be accompanied by minimizing long-term adverse health outcomes from SCD and its treatment. SCD can have adverse effects on a variety of organ systems, including the heart, lung, kidney, and reproductive system, leading to high disease burden, morbidity, and premature mortality in both pediatric and adult patients. While curative therapies are being increasingly used, there remains a paucity of data on the long-term health outcomes associated with these treatments in children and adults with SCD. There are data available regarding the effects of HSCT performed largely for malignant diseases, from which data on SCD outcomes may be extrapolated. However, given the significant differences between these 2 populations of patients who undergo HSCT, such extrapolation is imprecise at best. Furthermore, there are currently no published data on long-term health outcomes following gene therapy for SCD due to current short follow-up times. We summarize the limited data reported on health outcomes following HSCT for SCD and emphasize the need for more research within this area.
36645839	Prevalence and Risk Factors for Pulmonary Embolism in Pediatric Sickle Cell Disease: A National Administrative Database Study.	Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) have a high risk for venous thromboembolism which is associated with increased risk of mortality. Studies examining risk of pulmonary embolism (PE) in children with SCD are lacking. This study was conducted in children with SCD between 0-21 years of age using a nationwide administrative database in the United States- Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) from January 2010 to June 2021. Diagnostic codes and imaging, procedure, and pharmaceutical billing codes were used to identify PE and potential clinical, demographic, and utilization risk factors. Logistic regression analyses were performed to assess association between risk factors and PE. We identified 22,631 unique patients with SCD with a median age of 10.8 years (range: <0.1-20.9). A total of 120 (0.53%) patients developed a PE with median age of 17.4 years (range: 6.6-20.9) at PE diagnosis. Patients with PE had longer hospitalization and more frequent ICU admissions than patients without PE (p < 0.001). Risk factors significantly associated with PE on multivariable analysis included older age, prior history of central venous line (CVL), acute chest syndrome, and apheresis. Mortality was not significantly different between those with and without PE. The prevalence of PE in hospitalized children with SCD was estimated to be 0.53%. Patients with PE had higher healthcare utilization characteristics. Factors significantly associated with PE suggest that the risk for PE in SCD may be related to the severity of disease state. Future trials are needed for risk stratification and PE prevention strategies in children with SCD.
33029796	Hydroxyurea Pharmacokinetics in Pediatric Patients After Total Pancreatectomy With Islet Autotransplantation.	Total pancreatectomy with islet autotransplantation is a complex surgical approach for acute recurrent or chronic pancreatitis that frequently triggers extreme thrombocytosis (platelets >= 1000 x 109 /L). Thrombocytosis can be prothrombotic, so cytoreductive hydroxyurea is often initiated after this surgery; however, optimal dosing strategy and efficacy are unknown. This prospective pilot study characterized the pharmacokinetics of hydroxyurea after this procedure in children. It also compared them with previously published pediatric parameters in sickle cell anemia (SCA), the disease in which pediatric hydroxyurea pharmacokinetics have primarily been studied. Plasma hydroxyurea levels were quantified in 14 participants aged 4-19 years using high-performance liquid chromatography. Blood collections were scheduled 20 minutes, 1 hour, and 4 hours after the first dose, on pharmacokinetic day 1 (PK1), and again 2-3 months later if still on hydroxyurea (PK2). Six participants had PK1 and PK2 data at all 3 postdose timed collections, 5 only had PK1 samples, and 3 only had PK2 samples. Total pancreatectomy with islet autotransplantation participants had reduced and delayed absorption compared with sickle cell anemia participant data from the Hydroxyurea Study of Long-Term Effects, regardless of timing or dosing methodology. Total pancreatectomy with islet autotransplantation participants had different pharmacokinetic profiles at PK1 versus PK2, with lower dose-normalized exposures than previously reported in sickle cell anemia. These results suggest variability exists in hydroxyurea absorption and bioavailability in total pancreatectomy with islet autotransplantation patients, suspected to be primarily because of Roux-en-Y reconstruction, and suggest that more pharmacokinetic data are needed for scenarios when hydroxyurea is prescribed to children without sickle cell anemia.
31743153	Reflections of Healthcare Experiences of African Americans With Sickle Cell Disease or Cancer: A Qualitative Study.	BACKGROUND: The experiences of African American adult patients before, during, and after acute care utilization are not well characterized for individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD) or cancer. OBJECTIVE: To describe the experiences of African Americans with SCD or cancer before, during, and after hospitalization for pain control. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative study among African American participants with SCD (n = 15; 11 male; mean age, 32.7 +- 10.9 years; mean pain intensity, 7.8 +- 2.6) or cancer (n = 15; 7 male; mean age, 53.7 +- 15.2 years; mean pain intensity, 4.9 +- 3.7). Participants completed demographic questions and pain intensity using PAINReportIt and responded to a 7-item open-ended interview, which was recorded and transcribed verbatim. We used content analysis to identify themes in the participants' responses. RESULTS: Themes identified included reason for admission, hospital experiences, and discharge expectations. Pain was the primary reason for admission for participants with SCD (n = 15) and for most participants with cancer (n = 10). Participants of both groups indicated that they experienced delayed treatment and a lack of communication. Participants with SCD also reported accusations of drug-seeking behavior, perceived mistreatment, and feeling of not being heard or believed. Participants from both groups verbalized concerns about well-being after discharge and hopeful expectations. CONCLUSIONS: Race-concordant participants with SCD but not with cancer communicated perceived bias from healthcare providers. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Practice change interventions are needed to improve patient-provider interactions, reduce implicit bias, and increase mutual trust, as well as facilitate more effective pain control, especially for those who with SCD.

37612699	Factors associated with hospital admission and 30-day readmission for children less than 18 years of age in 2018 in France: a one-year nationwide observational study.	BACKGROUND: Nationwide data for children for short-stay hospitalisation (SSH) and associated factors are scarce. This retrospective study of children in France < 18 years of age followed after their birth or birthday in 2018 focused on at least one annual SSH, stay < 1 night or >= 1 night, or 30-day readmission >= 1 night. METHODS: Children were selected from the national health data system (SNDS), which includes data on long-term chronic disease (LTD) status with full reimbursement and complementary universal coverage based on low household income (CMUC). Uni and multivariate quasi-Poisson regression were applied for each outcome. RESULTS: Among 13.211 million children (94.4% population, 51.2% boys), CMUC was identified for 17.5% and at least one LTD for 4% (0-<1 year: 1.5%; 14-<18 year: 5.2%). The most frequent LTDs were pervasive developmental diseases (0.53%), asthma (0.24%), epilepsy (0.17%), and type 1 diabetes (0.15%). At least one SSH was found for 8.8%: SSH < 1 night (4.9%), SSH >= 1 night (4.5%), readmission (0.4%). Children with at least one SSH were younger (median 6 vs. 9 years) and more often had CMUC (21%), a LTD (12%), an emergency department (ED) visit (56%), or various primary healthcare visits than all children. Those with a SSH >=1 night vs. < 1 night were older (median: 9 vs. 4 years). They had the same frequency of LTD (13.4%) but more often an ED visit (78% vs. 42%). Children with readmissions were younger (median 3 years). They had the highest levels of CMUC (29.3%), LTD (34%), EDs in their municipality (35% vs. 29% for the whole population) and ED visits (87%). In adjusted analysis, each outcome was significantly less frequent among girls than boys and more frequent for children with CMUC. LTDs with the largest association with SSH < 1 night were cystic fibrosis, sickle cell diseases (SCD), diabetes type 1, those with SSH >=1 night type 1 diabetes epilepsy and SCD, and those for readmissions lymphoid leukaemia, malignant neoplasm of the brain, and SCD. Among all SSH admissions of children < 10 years, 25.8% were potentially preventable. CONCLUSION: Higher SSH and readmission rates were found for children with certain LTD living in low-income households, suggesting the need or increase of specific policy actions and research.
33093339	Pain in Youth With Sickle Cell Disease: A Report From the Sickle Cell Clinical Research and Intervention Program.	OBJECTIVES: Pain is prevalent among youth with sickle cell disease (SCD). However, previous research has been limited by small sample sizes and lacked examinations of developmental differences in pain, which are critical to minimizing the development of chronic pain as youth transition into adulthood. The primary aim of the current study was to compare pain and pain interference across 4 developmental groups in a large sample of youth with SCD. The secondary aim was to identify risk factors for greater pain and pain interference. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Utilizing a cross-sectional study design, the expression and predictors of pain and pain interference were compared across 4 developmental stages: toddlers/preschoolers (2 to 4 y), school-aged children (5 to 7 y), preadolescents (8 to 12 y), and adolescents (13 to 18 y). Participants included 386 youth with SCD and their caregivers. RESULTS: Caregiver-reported pain and pain interference and youth-reported pain interference increased across developmental groups and plateaued approaching adolescence (multivariate analyses of variance P=0.002 for pain and P<0.001 for pain interference). Elevated fatigue, anxiety, and perceived difficulties with pain management were the most robust predictors of higher youth- and caregiver-reported pain (betas ranging from 0.15 to 0.68; P<0.001) and pain interference (betas ranging from 0.18 to 0.64; P<0.001). DISCUSSION: Disease and treatment-related variables were not associated with pain. Self-reported pain was elevated in older versus younger developmental groups and was largely linked to anxiety, fatigue, and perceptions of pain management, thus highlighting the modifiable nature of factors influencing pain among youth with SCD.
36708736	Expecting more: the case for incorporating fertility services into comprehensive sickle cell disease care.	Assisted reproductive technologies (ART) are not yet systematically available to people with sickle cell disease or their parents. Fertility care for these groups requires addressing sickle cell disease-associated infertility risks, fertility preservation options, pregnancy possibilities and outcomes, and, when needed, infertility treatment. People with a chance of having a child with sickle cell disease can use in-vitro fertilisation with preimplantation genetic testing to conceive a child unaffected by sickle cell disease. Also, parents of children with sickle cell disease can use this technology to identify embryos to become potential future matched sibling donors for stem cell transplant. In the USA, disparities in fertility care for the sickle cell disease community are especially stark. Universal screening of newborn babies' identifies sickle cell disease and sickle cell trait, guidelines direct preconception genetic carrier screening, and standard-of-care fertility preserving options exist. However, potentially transformative treatments and cures for patients with sickle cell disease are not used due to iatrogenic infertility concerns. In diversely resourced care settings, obstacles to providing fertility care to people affected by sickle cell disease persist. In this Viewpoint, we contend that fertility care should be incorporated into the comprehensive care model for sickle cell disease, supporting alignment of treatment goals with reproductive life plans and delivering on the promise of individualised high-quality care for people with sickle cell disease and their families. We consider the obligation to provide fertility care in light of medical evidence, with acknowledgment of formidable obstacles to optimising care, and powerful historical and ethical considerations.
32570659	Preliminary Evaluation of a mHealth Coaching Conversational Artificial Intelligence for the Self-Care Management of People with Sickle-Cell Disease.	Adherence to the complex set of recommended self-care practices among people with Sickle-Cell Disease (SCD) positively impacts health outcomes. However, few patients possess the required skills (i.e. disease-specific knowledge, adequate levels of self-efficacy). Consequently, adherence rates remain low and only 1% of patients are empowered enough to master the self-care practices. Health coaching and therapeutic patient education have emerged as new approaches to enhance patients' self-management and support health behavior changes. This preliminary feasibility study examined patients' perceived usefulness of the information provided by a chatbot we developed following patient-important requirements collected during our preliminary studies. Participants tested the chatbot and completed a post-test survey. A total of 19 patients were enrolled and 2 withdrew. 15 respondents (15/17, 88%) gave a score of at least 3/4 to the question "The chatbot contains all the information I need". Results suggest that mHealth coaching apps could be used to promote the knowledge acquisition of recommended health behaviors related to the prevention of SCD main symptoms.
38714239	Evaluation of Anti-Sickling Effects of Two Varieties of Cajanus cajan (L.) Huth on Sickle Cell Beta Thalassemia.	ETHNO-PHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Globally, the prevalence of sickle cell disease is on the rise, with developing countries experiencing particularly alarming mortality rate compared to developed nations. The World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations (UN) have acknowledged sickle cell disease as a significant global public health concern. Unfortunately, a cure for this condition is yet to be discovered, and existing allopathic treatments, while offering relief, come with serious side effects. In recent times, there has been a growing interest in exploring the potential of medicinal plants for treating sickle cell disease due to their content of secondary metabolites that may impact the disease's mechanisms. Cajanus cajan, a crucial grain legume in rain-fed agriculture in semi-arid tropics, has been traditionally used in folk medicine to manage various illnesses and is suggested to possess anti-sickling properties. AIM OF THE STUDY: The present study investigated two varieties of C. cajan for their effectiveness in treating sickle cell beta thalassemia, a variant of sickle cell disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was divided into four groups consisting of the untreated group (group 1), group treated with standard drug (group 2), group treated with white C. cajan (group 3) and group treated with brown C. cajan (group 4). The effects of the two variety of C. cajan were measured by polymerization test, reversibility test, osmotic fragility test, deoxygenation and beta globin synthesis test. RESULT: The results revealed that both varieties of C. cajan demonstrated a reduction in polymerization rates, reversed sickled red blood cells, increased the oxygen affinity of Hb-S/beta, elevated the Fe2+/Fe3+ ratio, and maintained the membrane stability of red blood cells. Notably, the white variety exhibited superior anti-sickling properties compared to the brown variety. CONCLUSION: This suggests that this significant leguminous crop could be utilized for the treatment and management of sickling disorders, particularly in low-income countries where conventional treatments may be financially inaccessible to patients.
31628051	Improved Titer and Gene Transfer by Lentiviral Vectors Using Novel, Small beta-Globin Locus Control Region Elements.	beta-globin lentiviral vectors (beta-LV) have faced challenges in clinical translation for gene therapy of sickle cell disease (SCD) due to low titer and sub-optimal gene transfer to hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). To overcome the challenge of preserving efficacious expression while increasing vector performance, we used published genomic and epigenomic data available through ENCODE to redefine enhancer element boundaries of the beta-globin locus control region (LCR) to construct novel ENCODE core sequences. These novel LCR elements were used to design a beta-LV of reduced proviral length, termed CoreGA-AS3-FB, produced at higher titers and possessing superior gene transfer to HSPCs when compared to the full-length parental beta-LV at equal MOI. At low vector copy number, vectors containing the ENCODE core sequences were capable of reversing the sickle phenotype in a mouse model of SCD. These studies provide a beta-LV that will be beneficial for gene therapy of SCD by significantly reducing the cost of vector production and extending the vector supply.
38718133	Nothing about us without us: Advocacy and engagement in genetic medicine.	The development of new genetic medicines to treat sickle cell disease highlights the need for greater collaboration between researchers and people with lived experiences. Drawing on the adage "Nothing about us, without us," we call for increased investments in community advocacy and engagement.
34021342	Clinical validity and utility of preconception expanded carrier screening for the management of reproductive genetic risk in IVF and general population.	STUDY QUESTION: What is the clinical validity and utility of preconception Expanded Carrier Screening (ECS) application on the management of prospective parents? SUMMARY ANSWER: The high detection rate of at-risk couples (ARCs) and the high proportion opting for IVF/preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) treatment demonstrate the clinical utility of ECS in the preconception space in IVF and general population. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: About 2-4% of couples are at risk of conceiving a child with an autosomal recessive or X-linked genetic disorder. In recent years, the increasing cost-effectiveness of genetic diagnostic techniques has allowed the creation of ECS panels for the simultaneous detection of multiple recessive disorders. Comprehensive preconception genetic screening holds the potential to significantly improve couple's genetic risk assessment and reproductive planning to avoid detectable inheritable genetic offspring. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A total of 3877 individuals without a family history of genetic conditions were analyzed between January 2017 and January 2020. Of the enrolled individuals, 1212 were gamete donors and 2665 were patients planning on conceiving from both the IVF and the natural conception group. From the non-donor cohort, 1133 were analyzed as individual patients, while the remaining ones were analyzed as couples, for a total of 766 couples. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: A focused ECS panel was developed following American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology ACOG-recommended criteria (prevalence, carrier rate, severity), including highly penetrant severe childhood conditions. Couples were defined at-risk when both partners carried an autosomal recessive pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant (PLP) on the same gene or when the woman was a carrier of an X-linked PLP variant. ARC detection rate defined the clinical validity of the ECS approach. Clinical utility was evaluated by monitoring ARCs reproductive decision making. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: A total of 402 individuals (10.4%) showed PLP for at least one of the genes tested. Among the 766 couples tested, 173 showed one carrier partner (22.6%), whereas 20 couples (2.6%) were found to be at increased risk. Interestingly, one ARC was identified as a result of cascade testing in the extended family of an individual carrying a pathogenic variant on the Survival Of Motor Neuron 1SMN1 gene. Of the identified ARCs, 5 (0.7%) were at risk for cystic fibrosis, 5 (0.7%) for fragile X syndrome, 4 (0.5%) for spinal muscular atrophy, 4 (0.5%) for Beta-Thalassemia/Sickle Cell Anemia, 1 (0.1%) for Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome and 1 (0.1%) for Duchenne/Becker Dystrophy. Fifteen ARCs were successfully followed up from both the IVF and the natural conception groups. All of these (15/15) modified their reproductive planning by undergoing ART with Preimplantation Genetic Testing for Monogenic disease and Aneuploidies (PGT-M and PGT-A). To date, 6/15 (40%) couples completed their PGT cycle with euploid/unaffected embryos achieving a pregnancy after embryo transfer and three of them have already had an unaffected baby. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The use of a limited panel of core gene-disease pairs represents a limitation on the research perspective as it can underestimate the rate of detectable carriers and ARCs in this cohort of prospective parents. Expanding the scope of ECS to a larger panel of conditions is becoming increasingly feasible, thanks to a persistent technological evolution and progressive cataloging of gene-disease associations. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: These results highlight the potential clinical validity and utility of ECS in reducing the risk of a pregnancy affected by a detectable inheritable genetic condition. The steady reduction in the costs of genetic analyses enables the expansion of monogenic testing/screening applications at the preimplantation stage, thus, providing valid decisional support and reproductive autonomy to patients, particularly in the context of IVF.

37646569	Males with sickle cell disease have higher risks of cerebrovascular disease, increased inflammation, and a reduced response to hydroxyurea.	Biological sex is important. Male sex is associated with worse outcomes in most measures, including cerebrovascular disease, hospital admissions, and blood transfusions, but not survival. Females also appear to have a better response to hydroxyurea therapy, reduced markers of inflammation, and better liver function.
32330288	Protecting vulnerable patients with inherited anaemias from unnecessary death during the COVID-19 pandemic.	With the developing COVID-19 pandemic, patients with inherited anaemias require specific advice regarding isolation and changes to usual treatment schedules. The National Haemoglobinopathy Panel (NHP) has issued guidance on the care of patients with sickle cell disease, thalassaemia, Diamond Blackfan anaemia (DBA), congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia (CDA), sideroblastic anaemia, pyruvate kinase deficiency and other red cell enzyme and membrane disorders. Cascading of accurate information for clinicians and patients is paramount to preventing adverse outcomes, such as patients who are at increased risk of fulminant bacterial infection due to their condition or its treatment erroneously self-isolating if their fever is mistakenly attributed to a viral cause, delaying potentially life-saving antibiotic therapy. Outpatient visits should be minimised for most patients, however some, such as first transcranial dopplers for children with sickle cell anaemia should not be delayed as known risk of stroke will outweigh the unknown risk from COVID-19 infection. Blood transfusion programmes should be continued, but specific changes to usual clinical pathways can be instituted to reduce risk of patient exposure to COVID-19, as well as contingency planning for possible reductions in blood available for transfusions. Bone marrow transplants for these disorders should be postponed until further notice. With the current lack of evidence on the risk and complications of COVID-19 infection in these patients, national data collection is ongoing to record outcomes and eventually to identify predictors of disease severity, particularly important if further waves of infection travel through the population.
34139105	A systems pharmacology model for gene therapy in sickle cell disease.	We developed a mathematical model for autologous stem cell therapy to cure sickle cell disease (SCD). Experimental therapies using this approach seek to engraft stem cells containing a curative gene. These stem cells are expected to produce a lifelong supply of red blood cells (RBCs) containing an anti-sickling hemoglobin. This complex, multistep treatment is expensive, and there is limited patient data available from early clinical trials. Our objective was to quantify the impact of treatment parameters, such as initial stem cell dose, efficiency of lentiviral transduction, and degree of bone marrow preconditioning on engraftment efficiency, peripheral RBC numbers, and anti-sickling hemoglobin levels over time. We used ordinary differential equations to model RBC production from progenitor cells in the bone marrow, and hemoglobin assembly from its constituent globin monomers. The model recapitulates observed RBC and hemoglobin levels in healthy and SCD phenotypes. Treatment simulations predict dynamics of stem cell engraftment and RBC containing the therapeutic gene product. Post-treatment dynamics show an early phase of reconstitution due to short lived stem cells, followed by a sustained RBC production from stable engraftment of long-term stem cells. This biphasic behavior was previously reported in the literature. Sensitivity analysis of the model quantified relationships between treatment parameters and efficacy. The initial dose of transduced stem cells, and the intensity of myeloablative bone marrow preconditioning are predicted to most positively impact long-term outcomes. The quantitative systems pharmacology approach used here demonstrates the value of model-assisted therapeutic design for gene therapies in SCD.
34234298	Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation reverses white matter injury measured by diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) in sickle cell disease patients.	Brain injury in sickle cell disease (SCD) comprises a wide spectrum of neurological damage. Neurocognitive deficits have been described even without established neurological lesions. DTI is a rapid, noninvasive, and non-contrast method that enables detection of normal-appearing white matter lesions not detected by conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The aim of the study was to evaluate if stem cell transplantation can revert white matter lesions in patients with SCD. Twenty-eight SCD patients were evaluated with MRI and DTI before and after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), compared with 26 healthy controls (HC). DTI metrics included fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), radial (RD), and axial (AD) diffusivity maps, global efficiency, path length, and clustering coefficients. Compared to HC, SCD patients had a lower FA (p = 0.0086) before HSCT. After HSCT, FA increased and was not different from healthy controls (p = 0.1769). Mean MD, RD, and AD decreased after HSCT (p = 0.0049; p = 0.0029; p = 0.0408, respectively). We confirm previous data of white matter lesions in SCD and present evidence that HSCT promotes recovery of brain injury with potential improvement of brain structural connectivity.
38684631	Cost-Effectiveness of Lovotibeglogene Autotemcel (Lovo-Cel) Gene Therapy for Patients with Sickle Cell Disease and Recurrent Vaso-Occlusive Events in the United States.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Gene therapies for sickle cell disease (SCD) may offer meaningful benefits for patients and society. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of lovotibeglogene autotemcel (lovo-cel), a one-time gene therapy administered via autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, compared with common care for patients in the United States (US) with SCD aged >= 12 years with >= 4 vaso-occlusive events (VOEs) in the past 24 months. METHODS: We developed a patient-level simulation model accounting for lovo-cel and SCD-related events, complications, and mortality over a lifetime time horizon. The pivotal phase 1/2 HGB-206 clinical trial (NCT02140554) served as the basis for lovo-cel efficacy and safety. Cost, quality-of-life, and other clinical data were sourced from HGB-206 data and the literature. Analyses were conducted from US societal and third-party payer perspectives. Uncertainty was assessed through probabilistic sensitivity analysis and extensive scenario analyses. RESULTS: Patients treated with lovo-cel were predicted to survive 23.84 years longer on average (standard deviation [SD], 12.80) versus common care (life expectancy, 62.24 versus 38.40 years), with associated discounted patient quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gains of 10.20 (SD, 4.10) and direct costs avoided of $1,329,201 (SD, $1,346,446) per patient. Predicted societal benefits included discounted caregiver QALY losses avoided of 1.19 (SD, 1.38) and indirect costs avoided of $540,416 (SD, $262,353) per patient. Including lovo-cel costs ($3,282,009 [SD, $29,690] per patient) resulted in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of $191,519 and $124,051 per QALY gained from third-party payer and societal perspectives, respectively. In scenario analyses, the predicted cost-effectiveness of lovo-cel also was sensitive to baseline age and VOE frequency and to the proportion of patients achieving and maintaining complete resolution of VOEs. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis of lovo-cel gene therapy compared with common care for patients in the US with SCD with recurrent VOEs estimated meaningful improvements in survival, quality of life, and other clinical outcomes accompanied by increased overall costs for the health care system and for broader society. The predicted economic value of lovo-cel gene therapy was influenced by uncertainty in long-term clinical effects and by positive spillover effects on patient productivity and caregiver burden.
36067800	Diverse Approaches to Gene Therapy of Sickle Cell Disease.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) results from a single base pair change in the sixth codon of the beta-globin chain of hemoglobin, which promotes aggregation of deoxyhemoglobin, increasing rigidity of red blood cells and causing vaso-occlusive and hemolytic complications. Allogeneic transplant of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) can eliminate SCD manifestations but is limited by absence of well-matched donors and immune complications. Gene therapy with transplantation of autologous HSCs that are gene-modified may provide similar benefits without the immune complications. Much progress has been made, and patients are realizing significant clinical improvements in multiple trials using different approaches with lentiviral vector-mediated gene addition to inhibit hemoglobin aggregation. Gene editing approaches are under development to provide additional therapeutic opportunities. Gene therapy for SCD has advanced from an attractive concept to clinical reality.
32083384	A pilot study to screen for poor academic performance in children with sickle cell disease in the outpatient setting.	BACKGROUND: Children with sickle cell disease (SCD) are at risk for neurocognitive deficits, which can lead to effects on academic performance and later job attainment. However, screening in children at high risk for poor academic performance (PAP) in a clinic setting has been limited. The goal was to identify young children with SCD at high risk for PAP via administration of a standardized screening tool at the clinic visit. PROCEDURE: Parents of 20 patients were asked to complete the Behavior Assessment System for Children, 3rd edition (BASC-3) Parent Rating Scale. Children ages six to nine years and all SCD genotypes were included. Those patients who scored at least 1 standard deviation below the mean were considered high risk. Statistics was used to associate demographic, academic, and laboratory data with risk status (RS). RESULTS: Four of 20 patients (20%) were found to be at risk by the BASC-3. A significant association was found between those with a history of PAP and RS (P = 0.001). A trend toward association was found between baseline hemoglobin, reticulocyte count, and RS. Children not at risk had a higher hemoglobin level and lower reticulocyte count (P = 0.37 and P = 0.20, respectively). Those on hydroxyurea were significantly less likely to score as at risk (P = 0.014), whereas those with siblings may be at greater risk (P = 0.037). CONCLUSION(S): A parent-directed screening tool may identify children with SCD in need of additional school support. Further prospective studies are necessary to understand correlations found between hemoglobin, reticulocyte count, and hydroxyurea treatment and risk for PAP.
37865180	Multi-component Strategy Improves HPV Vaccination Rates among Adolescents with Sickle Cell Disease.	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a vaccine strategy bundle to increase HPV vaccine initiation and completion in a specialty clinic setting. STUDY DESIGN: Our Hematology clinic utilized an implementation framework from October 1, 2018, to December 31, 2019, involving nurses, nursing coordinators, and clinicians in administering the HPV vaccination series to our adolescent sickle cell sample of nearly 500 patients. The bundle included education for staff on the need for HPV vaccine administration, provider incentives, vaccines offered to patients in SCD clinics, and verification of patients' charts of vaccine completion. RESULTS: Following the implementation of the bundle, the cumulative incidence of HPV vaccination initiation and completion improved from 28% to 46% and 7% to 49%, respectively. Both rates remained higher post-implementation as well. HPV vaccination series completion was associated with a decreased distance to the healthcare facility, lower state deprivation rank, and increased hospitalizations. CONCLUSION: Our clinic's implementation strategy successfully improved vaccine completion rates among adolescents with SCD while continuing to educate staff, patients, and families on the importance of cancer prevention among people living with SCD.
36485154	No crystal stair: supporting fertility care and the pursuit of pregnancy in women with sickle cell disease.	Growing recognition that the ovary is an end organ in sickle cell disease (SCD), advances in SCD treatment and cure, and innovations in assisted reproductive technologies invite progressive challenges in fertility care for women with SCD. The reproductive life span of women with SCD may be reduced because ovarian reserve declines more rapidly in people with SCD compared to unaffected people. Some young women have diminished ovarian reserve, a risk factor for infertility. Referrals for fertility preservation may be offered and anticipatory guidance about when to seek infertility care provided. For a subset of people with SCD, this information is also applicable when pursuing in vitro fertilization with preimplantation genetic testing to avoid implantation of an embryo with SCD. Here we explore the dimensions of SCD-related fertility care illustrated by the case of a 28-year-old woman with hemoglobin SS disease who initially presented for a hematology consultation for preconception counseling. This case highlights the complexity of preconception SCD management and care and the need to partner with patients to help align pregnancy hopes with SCD treatment and the many associated uncertainties.

32892996	Adherence to Iron Chelation Therapy with Deferasirox Formulations among Patients with Sickle Cell Disease and beta-thalassemia.	BACKGROUND: Individuals with hemoglobinopathies experience complications that often require management with multiple transfusions. These chronic transfusions can lead to iron overload, which places them at increased risk of organ damage, malignancy, and even death. Deferasirox is the most common iron chelator used to treat iron overload due to its safety, efficacy, and oral administration. The first formulation of deferasirox, a dispersible tablet for oral suspension (DT) called Exjade , was associated with adherence challenges due to complaints from poor taste and side effects such as abdominal discomfort. A new film-coated tablet formulation (FCT) called Jadenu  was subsequently developed to overcome these challenges. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare adherence rates between formulations of deferasirox (DT versus FCT) and describe associations between adherence to chelation therapy and changes in hematological parameters among patients with SCD and beta-thalassemia. METHODS: In this retrospective study of 20 children and adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) and beta-thalassemia with iron overload, we compared adherence rates for deferasirox DT versus deferasirox FCT. We reviewed data from the electronic medical record and pharmacy expense reports between 2014 and 2018. We calculated the mean medication possession ratio (MPR) and analyzed the mean paired difference in MPR and ferritin levels using paired sample t-test. RESULTS: The overall mean MPR was 0.15 (0.25) for deferasirox DT and 0.44 (0.32) for deferasirox FCT. The mean paired difference in MPR when transitioning from deferasirox DT to deferasirox FCT was +0.29, p-value < 0.01 (95% CI: 0.19, 0.39). The mean paired difference in ferritin while on deferasirox DT compared to ferritin 6 months after transitioning to deferasirox FCT was -306 ng/mL p-value = 0.14 (95% CI: 719, 113). CONCLUSION: There was significant improvement in adherence to iron chelation therapy when patients transitioned from deferasirox DT to deferasirox FCT.

Introduction: Due to advances in disease management, mortality rates in children with sickle cell disease (SCD) have decreased. However, mortality rates for young adults (YA) increased, and understanding of social and psychological factors is critical. The aim of this study was to explore factors associated with health care transition experiences for YA with SCD. Method: This was a qualitative descriptive study. A 45-minute semistructured interview was conducted with 13 YA (M = 21.5 years, SD = 1.73). Results: Results suggest that social and psychological factors and self-management experiences influence health care transition. Eight themes emerged: "need for accessible support"; "early assistance with goal setting"; "incongruence among expectations, experiences, and preparation"; "spiritual distress"; "stigma"; "need for collaboration"; "appreciation for caring providers"; and "feeling isolated." Discussion: Consideration of cultural contexts will guide nurses in supporting health care transition. Designing culturally relevant interventions that address unique needs for YA living with SCD is warranted.
34224261	Treatment of Acute Pain in Adults With Sickle Cell Disease in an Infusion Center Versus the Emergency Department : A Multicenter Prospective Cohort Study.	BACKGROUND: Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) have vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs). Infusion centers (ICs) are alternatives to emergency department (ED) care and may improve patient outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether care in ICs or EDs leads to better outcomes for the treatment of uncomplicated VOCs. DESIGN: Prospective cohort. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02411396). SETTING: 4 U.S. sites, with recruitment between April 2015 and December 2016. PARTICIPANTS: Adults with SCD living within 60 miles of a study site. MEASUREMENTS: Participants were followed for 18 months after enrollment. Outcomes of interest were time to first dose of parenteral pain medication, whether pain reassessment was completed within 30 minutes after the first dose, and patient disposition on discharge from the acute care visit. Treatment effects for ICs versus EDs were estimated using a time-varying propensity score adjustment. RESULTS: Researchers enrolled 483 participants; the 269 who had acute care visits on weekdays are included in this report. With inverse probability of treatment-weighted adjustment, the mean time to first dose was 62 minutes in ICs and 132 minutes in EDs; the difference was 70 minutes (95% CI, 54 to 98 minutes; E-value, 2.8). The probability of pain reassessment within 30 minutes of the first dose of parenteral pain medication was 3.8 times greater (CI, 2.63 to 5.64 times greater; E-value, 4.7) in the IC than the ED. The probability that a participant's visit would end in admission to the hospital was smaller by a factor of 4 (0.25 [CI, 0.18 to 0.33]) with treatment in an IC versus an ED. LIMITATION: The study was restricted to participants with uncomplicated VOCs. CONCLUSION: In adults with SCD having a VOC, treatment in an IC is associated with substantially better outcomes than treatment in an ED.

32893954	Acute chest syndrome in the setting of SARS-COV-2 infections-A case series at an urban medical center in the Bronx.	New York City has emerged as one of the epicenters of the SARS-COV-2 pandemic, with the Bronx being disproportionately affected. This novel coronavirus has caused significant respiratory manifestations raising the concern for development of acute chest syndrome (ACS) in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). We report a series of pediatric SCD SARS-COV-2-positive patients admitted with ACS. SARS-COV-2-positive SCD patients, who did not develop ACS, were the comparison group. Hydroxyurea use (P-value = .02) and lower absolute monocyte counts (P-value = .04) were noted in patients who did not develop ACS. These preliminary findings need to be further evaluated in larger cohorts.
32578506	Engagement in Household Chores in Youth With Chronic Conditions: Health care Transition Implications.	This study examined associations between chores engagement, self-management, and transition readiness in youth with chronic conditions. Youths with various chronic conditions attending a therapeutic camp, and their parents participated. Responses of 165 campers and their parents were analyzed (mean camper age 12.3 +- 2.6 years, 47.9% males, 79.4% White). The most common diagnoses were diabetes, spina bifida, cerebral palsy, and sickle cell anemia. Youth who completed chores manifested higher overall health care transition readiness (beta^ = 5.17, p = .026) and better communication with providers (beta^ = 2.98, p = .006) than youth who completed no chores. Higher chores frequency was not more predictive of higher health care transition readiness scores above and beyond the effects of having chores at all. These results suggest that responsible health care behaviors are related to similar actions in other areas of life. Assignment of chores may promote self-management and health care transition readiness in youth with chronic conditions.
31985807	American Society of Hematology 2020 guidelines for sickle cell disease: transfusion support.	BACKGROUND: Red cell transfusions remain a mainstay of therapy for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), but pose significant clinical challenges. Guidance for specific indications and administration of transfusion, as well as screening, prevention, and management of alloimmunization, delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions (DHTRs), and iron overload may improve outcomes. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to develop evidence-based guidelines to support patients, clinicians, and other healthcare professionals in their decisions about transfusion support for SCD and the management of transfusion-related complications. METHODS: The American Society of Hematology formed a multidisciplinary panel that was balanced to minimize bias from conflicts of interest and that included a patient representative. The panel prioritized clinical questions and outcomes. The Mayo Clinic Evidence-Based Practice Research Program supported the guideline development process. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to form recommendations, which were subject to public comment. RESULTS: The panel developed 10 recommendations focused on red cell antigen typing and matching, indications, and mode of administration (simple vs red cell exchange), as well as screening, prevention, and management of alloimmunization, DHTRs, and iron overload. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of panel recommendations were conditional due to the paucity of direct, high-certainty evidence for outcomes of interest. Research priorities were identified, including prospective studies to understand the role of serologic vs genotypic red cell matching, the mechanism of HTRs resulting from specific alloantigens to inform therapy, the role and timing of regular transfusions during pregnancy for women, and the optimal treatment of transfusional iron overload in SCD.
32878859	Long-term oxygen therapy in children with sickle cell disease and hypoxaemia.	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the acceptability and safety profile of nocturnal long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) in children with sickle cell disease (SCD) and chronic hypoxaemia. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. PATIENTS, SETTING AND INTERVENTION: Children with SCD who started LTOT from 2014 to early 2019 in two tertiary hospitals in London, UK were retrospectively enrolled. Patients who started disease-modifying therapies <12 months before LTOT or while on LTOT were excluded. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Minor and major adverse events during LTOT were reported. Laboratory and clinical data, transcranial Doppler (TCD) scans and overnight oximetry studies performed at steady state within 12 months before and after starting LTOT were compared. RESULTS: Nineteen children (10 males; median age 12 years, range 6-15) were included. Nearly half of them (9/19; 47%) were on hydroxyurea at baseline. No child discontinued LTOT because of intolerance or poor adherence. No major adverse events were reported. Laboratory data did not show significant changes in haemoglobin and reticulocyte count after 1 year of follow-up. No statistically significant change in the incidence of vaso-occlusive pain events was noted (median annual rate from 0.5 to 0 episode per patient/year; p=0.062). Overnight oximetry tests performed while on LTOT showed improvements in all oxygen saturation parameters (mean overnight and nadir SpO2, % of time spent with SpO2 <90%) compared with the baseline. CONCLUSION: LTOT is a safe and feasible treatment option for children with SCD and chronic hypoxaemia.

38657597	[Transition in sickle cell disease - recommendations of the transition initiative sickle cell disease].	Sickle cell disease is a rare, but complex multi-systemic disorder with high need of interdisciplinary and specialized care and new structural requirements. Besides care of those chronically sick patients, transition process is a vulnerable phase which highly influences further treatment. To make matters worse, patients often have migration background with subsequent communication problems. A national guidance for a standardized transition process is lacking in Germany. In context of a structured consensus process, the "transition initiative sickle cell disease" developed specific recommendations for a structured transition of sickle cell patients on the basis of the S3 transition guideline of the DGfTM. These recommendations should improve this vulnerable process in this complex disease to ensure adequate further treatment and to avoid acute and chronic complications but also mental, social or job-related issues. Besides improvement of quality of life, medical treatment and survival, health economic aspects arise. Documents were developed to support and facilitate the transition process and are available under www.sichelzellkrankheit.info/transition/.
35588309	Hyperhemolysis in a patient with sickle cell disease and recent SARS-CoV-2 infection, with complex auto- and alloantibody work-up, successfully treated with tocilizumab.	BACKGROUND: Hyperhemolysis syndrome (HHS) is a severe delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction seen in sickle cell disease (SCD) patients, characterized by destruction of donor and recipient RBCs. It results in a drop in hemoglobin to below pretransfusion levels and frequently reticulocytopenia. CASE REPORT: We report a case of a man in his thirties with SCD with a recent hospitalization 2 weeks prior for COVID-19. His red cell antibody history included anti-Fy(a) and warm autoantibody. At that time, he was given 2 units of RBC and discharged with a hemoglobin of 10.2 g/dl. He returned to the hospital approximately 1.5 weeks later with hemoglobin 6.0 g/dl and symptoms concerning for acute chest syndrome. Pretransfusion testing now showed 4+ pan-agglutinin in both gel-based and tube-based testing. Alloadsorption identified an anti-N and a strong cold agglutinin. Three least incompatible units were transfused to this patient over several days, with evidence of hemolysis. Further reference lab work revealed anti-Fya , anti-Fyb , anti-Lea , anti-Leb , and an anti-KN system antibody. The patient's hemoglobin nadired at 4.4 g/dl. The patient was treated with a single dose of tocilizumab, his hemoglobin stabilized, and he was discharged. DISCUSSION: We present a case of HHS proximate to recent SARS-CoV-2 infection with multiple allo and autoantibodies identified. Information on the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and HHS is limited; however, it is possible that inflammation related to COVID-19 could predispose to HHS. Tocilizumab is an approved treatment for COVID-19. Additionally, tocilizumab appears to be a promising treatment option for patients with HHS.
31634463	Dysregulated NO/PDE5 signaling in the sickle cell mouse lower urinary tract: Reversal by oral nitrate therapy.	AIMS: Nitric oxide (NO) has a critical, but not well understood, influence in the physiology of the lower urinary tract. We evaluated the effect of NO/phosphodiesterase (PDE)5 signaling in voiding dysfunction in the sickle cell disease (SCD) mouse, characterized by low NO bioavailability. MAIN METHODS: Adult SCD (Sickle) and wild-type (WT) male mice were treated daily with sodium nitrate (10 mM) or vehicle. After 18 days, blood was obtained for nitrite measurement, urethra was collected for organ bath study, and bladder and urethra were collected for Western blot analysis of PDE5 phosphorylation (Ser-92) (activated form). Non-anesthetized mice underwent evaluation of urine volume by void spot assay. eNOS phosphorylation (Ser-1177) and nNOS phosphorylation (Ser-1412) (positive regulatory sites) were evaluated in the bladder and urethra of untreated mice. KEY FINDINGS: Sickle mice exhibited decreased eNOS, nNOS, and PDE5 phosphorylation in the bladder and urethra, decreased plasma nitrite levels, increased relaxation of phenylephrine-contracted urethral tissue to an NO donor sodium nitroprusside, and increased total urine volume, compared with WT mice. Nitrate treatment normalized plasma nitrite levels, relaxation of urethra to sodium nitroprusside, PDE5 phosphorylation in the urethra and bladder, and urine volume in Sickle mice. SIGNIFICANCE: Derangement in PDE5 activity associated with basally low NO bioavailability in the bladder and urethra contributes to the molecular basis for voiding abnormalities in Sickle mice. Inorganic nitrate supplementation normalized voiding in Sickle mice through mechanisms likely involving upregulation of PDE5 activity. These findings suggest that interventions targeting dysregulatory NO/PDE5 signaling may ameliorate overactive bladder in SCD.

34889383	Optimizing management of sickle cell disease in patients undergoing surgery.	Individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD) are likely to be referred for surgery at some point in their lifetime due to a high incidence of musculoskeletal and intrabdominal complications such as avascular necrosis and gallbladder disease. Preoperative optimization is a multidisciplinary process that involves a hematologist with SCD expertise, an anesthesiologist, and the surgical team. The type and risk classification of the surgery, disease severity, medications, baseline hemoglobin, transfusion history, and history of prior surgical complications are often documented. Clinicians should consider perioperative risk assessment that includes determining the patient's functional status and cardiovascular risk and screening for obstructive sleep apnea. Many patients will require preoperative transfusion to reduce the risk of postoperative complications such as acute chest syndrome and vaso-occlusive pain crises. The hematologist should consider the patient's preoperative transfusion requirements and ensure that the surgical team has an appropriate plan for postoperative observation and management. This often includes follow-up laboratory studies, a postoperative pain management plan, and venous thromboembolism prophylaxis. The transfusion plan should be patient-specific and take into account the SCD genotype, baseline hemoglobin, disease severity, risk classification of the surgery, and history of prior surgical complications. In the intraoperative and postoperative period, dehydration, hypothermia, hypotension, hypoxia, and acidosis should be avoided, and incentive spirometry should be utilized to minimize complications such as acute chest syndrome. In this review we discuss preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative strategies to optimize patients with SCD undergoing surgery.
34879990	Curative therapy for hemoglobinopathies: an International Society for Cell & Gene Therapy Stem Cell Engineering Committee review comparing outcomes, accessibility and cost of ex vivo stem cell gene therapy versus allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.	Thalassemia and sickle cell disease (SCD) are the most common monogenic diseases in the world and represent a growing global health burden. Management is limited by a paucity of disease-modifying therapies; however, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and autologous HSCT after genetic modification offer patients a curative option. Allogeneic HSCT is limited by donor selection, morbidity and mortality from transplant conditioning, graft-versus-host disease and graft rejection, whereas significant concerns regarding long-term safety, efficacy and cost limit the broad applicability of gene therapy. Here the authors review current outcomes in allogeneic and autologous HSCT for transfusion-dependent thalassemia and SCD and provide our perspective on issues surrounding accessibility and costs as barriers to offering curative therapy to patients with hereditary hemoglobinopathies.
32705357	Neuropathic Pain and Sickle Cell Disease: a Review of Pharmacologic Management.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Sickle cell disease (SCD) remains among the most common and severe monogenic disorders present in the world today. Although sickle cell pain has been traditionally characterized as nociceptive, a significant portion of sickle cell patients has reported neuropathic pain symptoms. Our review article will discuss clinical aspects of SCD-related neuropathic pain, epidemiology of neuropathic pain among individuals with SCD, pain mechanisms, and current and future potential pharmacological interventions. RECENT FINDINGS: Neuropathic pain in SCD is a complicated condition that often has a lifelong and significant negative impact on life; therefore, improved pain management is considered a significant and unmet need. Neuropathic pain mechanisms are heterogeneous, and the difficulty in determining their individual contribution to specific pain types may contribute to poor treatment outcomes in this population. Our review article outlines several pharmacological modalities which may be employed to treat neuropathic pain in SCD patients.
37832631	CRISPR-based precision medicine for hematologic disorders: Advancements, challenges, and prospects.	The development of programmable nucleases to introduce defined alterations in genomic sequences has been a powerful tool for precision medicine. While several nucleases such as zinc-finger nucleases (ZFN), transcriptor activator-like effector nucleases (TALEN), and meganucleases have been explored, the advent of CRISPR/Cas9 technology has revolutionized the field of genome engineering. In addition to disease modeling, the CRISPR/Cas9 technology has contributed to safer and more effective treatment strategies for hematologic diseases and personalized T-cell-based therapies. Here we discuss the applications of the CRISPR technology in the treatment of hematologic diseases, their efficacy, and ongoing clinical trials. We examine the obstacles to their successful use and the approaches investigated to overcome these challenges. Finally, we provide our perspectives to improve this genome editing tool for targeted therapies.
35114690	Quantitative analysis of mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccination response in immunocompromised adult hematology patients.	Vaccination guidelines for patients treated for hematological diseases are typically conservative. Given their high risk for severe COVID-19, it is important to identify those patients that benefit from vaccination. We prospectively quantified serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to spike subunit 1 (S1) antigens during and after 2-dose mRNA-1273 (Spikevax/Moderna) vaccination in hematology patients. Obtaining S1 IgG >= 300 binding antibody units (BAUs)/mL was considered adequate as it represents the lower level of S1 IgG concentration obtained in healthy individuals, and it correlates with potent virus neutralization. Selected patients (n = 723) were severely immunocompromised owing to their disease or treatment thereof. Nevertheless, >50% of patients obtained S1 IgG >= 300 BAUs/mL after 2-dose mRNA-1273. All patients with sickle cell disease or chronic myeloid leukemia obtained adequate antibody concentrations. Around 70% of patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD), multiple myeloma, or untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) obtained S1 IgG >= 300 BAUs/mL. Ruxolitinib or hypomethylating therapy but not high-dose chemotherapy blunted responses in myeloid malignancies. Responses in patients with lymphoma, patients with CLL on ibrutinib, and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell recipients were low. The minimal time interval after autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) to reach adequate concentrations was <2 months for multiple myeloma, 8 months for lymphoma, and 4 to 6 months after allogeneic HCT. Serum IgG4, absolute B- and natural killer-cell number, and number of immunosuppressants predicted S1 IgG >= 300 BAUs/mL. Hematology patients on chemotherapy, shortly after HCT, or with cGVHD should not be precluded from vaccination. This trial was registered at Netherlands Trial Register as #NL9553.
33735176	Descriptive analysis of sickle cell patients living in France: The PHEDRE cross-sectional study.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) induces chronic haemolytic anaemia and intermittent vaso-occlusion that results in tissue ischaemia causing acute, severe pain episodes that can lead to frequent hospitalizations. These consequences can have repercussions on family, social, school and/or professional life. Here, we present some of the results of the PHEDRE study (Pharmacodependance Et DREpanocytose-drug dependence and sickle-cell disease), which is the largest study of patients with SCD in France. This paper intends to describe characteristics of the French SCD population. We also aimed to assess the impact of the disease on the lives of patients using objective and subjective variables. METHODS: The PHEDRE study was a national multicentric observational study. Adults, adolescents and children with a confirmed SCD diagnosis were included in the study by their referring doctor. Then, they were interviewed by phone about their socioeconomic status, about the impact of the disease on their lives and about their analgesic and psychoactive drug use. RESULTS: The study population consisted of 872 patients (28% were minors). Seventy-two percent of adults were active, and all minors were in school. Many patients presented criteria of severe SCD. Seventy-five percent were homozygous SS, 15% were double heterozygotes SC and 8% were heterozygotes Sbetathal, 87% received specific treatment, 58% were hospitalized at least once for vaso-occlusive crisis in the past 12 months, and the number of analgesic drugs taken averaged 3.8. Seventy-five percent of patients reported academic or professional consequences related to their SCD, and 52% reported social consequences. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of SCD on patients' lives can be significant, nevertheless their social integration seems to be maintained. We highlighted respect of recommendations regarding analgesic treatments and only a few patients used tobacco, alcohol or cannabis. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical Trials, NCT02580565; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ Registered 16 October 2015.
36043959	Blood transfusion and iron overload in patients with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD): Personal experience and a short update of diabetes mellitus occurrence.	The conventional treatment of beta-thalassemia (beta-TM) patients is based on the correction of anemia through regular blood transfusions and iron chelation therapy. However, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains the only currently available technique that has curative potential. Variable frequency and severity of long-term growth and endocrine changes after conventional treatment as well as after HSCT have been reported by different centers. The goal of this mini-review is to summarize and update knowledge about long-term growth and endocrine changes after HSCT in patients with beta-TM in comparison to those occurring in beta-TM patients on conventional treatment. Regular surveillance, early diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up in a multi-disciplinary specialized setting are suggested to optimize the patient's quality of life (www.actabiomedica.it).
34786823	Use of infusion ports in patients with sickle cell disease: Indications and complications.	BACKGROUND: Peripheral venous access in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) can become difficult over time due to frequent access and scarring. Infusion ports provide reliable central venous access. Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and infections are complications associated with SCD and infusion ports. METHODS: We performed a 17.5-year single-institution retrospective chart review (January 2000 to July 2018) with literature review regarding use of infusion ports in patients with SCD. RESULTS: We identified 32 patients with infusion ports placed for a total of 63 devices (48 for chronic transfusion [CT] and 15 for poor venous access [PVA], not on CT) for a total of 99,272 catheter days. The mean age at first insertion was 8 years (range 1-20 years). Complications included malfunction, infection, thrombosis, difficult access, and pain over infusion port site. The rate of infection was 0.2 per 1000 catheter days. Thrombosis was identified in three devices (5%) in three patients (9%), with a rate of 0.03 per 1000 catheter days. There was no difference in complications by site in either the left or right subclavian vein (p = 1). The rate of premature removal was 0.36 per 1000 catheter days, which was higher among patients with infusion ports solely for PVA (0.87 per 1000 catheter days) compared with those placed for CT (0.29 per 1000 catheter days). CONCLUSION: Infusion ports in patients with SCD was associated with low rates of thrombosis, infection, and malfunction, and may be considered as an alternative to frequent intravenous access, especially in patients requiring CT.
33666363	Persistence of CRISPR/Cas9 gene edited hematopoietic stem cells following transplantation: A systematic review and meta-analysis of preclinical studies.	Gene editing blood-derived cells is an attractive approach to cure selected monogenic diseases but remains experimental. A systematic search of preclinical controlled studies is needed to determine the persistence of edited cells following reinfusion. All studies identified in our systematic search (to 20 October 2020) examining the use of CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing in blood-derived cells for transplantation were included. Meta-analysis was performed to determine the engraftment and persistence of gene edited cells. A total of 3538 preclinical studies were identified with 15 published articles meeting eligibility for meta-analysis. These in vivo animal studies examined editing of hemoglobin to correct sickle cell disease (eight studies), inducing resistance to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (two studies), and six other monogenic disorders (single studies). CRISPR-Cas9 edited hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells demonstrated equivalent early engraftment compared to controls in meta-analysis but persistence of gene-edited cells was reduced at later time points and in secondary transplant recipients. Subgroup analysis in studies targeting the hemoglobin gene revealed a significant reduction in the persistence of gene-edited cells whether homology-directed repair or nonhomologous end-joining were used. No adverse side effects were reported. Significant heterogeneity in study design and outcome reporting was observed and the potential for bias was identified in all studies. CRISPR-Cas9 gene edited cells engraft similarly to unedited hematopoietic cells. Persistence of gene edited cells, however, remains a challenge and improved methods of targeting hematopoietic stem cells are needed. Reducing heterogeneity and potential risk of bias will hasten the development of informative clinical trials.
32101564	Improved health care utilization and costs in transplanted versus non-transplanted adults with sickle cell disease.	Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) have access to fewer health care resources and therapies compared to other diseases, which contributes to increased morbidity and health care utilization. We compared health care utilization (inpatient hospital days, emergency care visits) and health care-related costs between SCD adults that underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) using a nonmyeloblative conditioning regimen versus those referred for HSCT but did not proceed due to lack of an HLA-matched sibling donor, denial by insurance, red blood cell antibodies to the potential donor, or declining further evaluation. Between 8/2011 and 4/2016, 83 SCD patients were referred for allogeneic HSCT and 16 underwent the procedure. The HSCT and non-HSCT groups were similar by age, sex, prior SCD-related therapy and complications. Compared to pre HSCT, significantly fewer inpatient hospital days (median of 1 versus 22 days, P = 0.003) and emergency care visits (median of 1 versus 4 visits, P = 0.04) were observed by the 2nd year post-HSCT. Similar results were observed in comparison to the standard-of-care group (median of 1 versus 12 hospital days, P = 0.002; median of 1 versus 3 emergency visits, P = 0.03). Lower health care costs were observed by the 2nd year post-HSCT (median of $16,281 versus $64,634 pre-HSCT (P = 0.01) and versus $54,082 in the standard-of-care group (P = 0.05). A median reduction of -$20,833/patient/year (IQR, -$67,078-+$4,442/patient/year) in health care costs compared to pre-HSCT was observed in the 2nd year post-HSCT. In conclusion, allogeneic HSCT leads to improvements in health care utilization and costs compared to standard-of-care therapy in high-risk SCD adults.
31656474	Patterns of paediatric emergency admissions and predictors of prolonged hospital stay at the children emergency room, University of Calabar Teaching Hospital, Calabar, Nigeria.	BACKGROUND: There is a high prevalence of paediatric emergency cases in less developed countries. However, prolonged hospital stay at emergency units may further overstretch the facilities. OBJECTIVE: To assess the patterns of presentations, services offered and predictors of a prolonged stay at the Children Emergency Room of a tertiary hospital in Southern Nigeria. METHODS: This prospective cross-sectional, study was conducted at the University of Calabar Teaching Hospital, Nigeria from 1st January-31st December 2014. Socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of consecutively recruited children (n=633) were recorded in a proforma. Binary logistic regression was conducted to determine predictors of prolonged stay (>72 hours). RESULT: The median age of participants was 2 (1 - 4.6) years. Three-fifths of children were admitted at off-hours and the commonest symptom was fever (73.9%). About 16.4% (95%CI:13.6% - 19.4%, n= 103/633) of the children had prolonged stay while those with sepsis had the longest mean stay (65.5+-72.1 hours). Children admitted on account of Sickle cell disease (OR:11.2, 95%CI:1.3-95.1, P-value = 0.03), Malaria (OR:10.7, 95%CI:1.4-82.5, P-value = 0.02) or sepsis (OR:10.5, 95%CI:1.3 - 82.7, P-value = 0.03) had higher odds of prolonged hospital stay. There was no significant difference in hospital stay among children admitted by the consultant as compared to other health personnel (P-value = 0.08). CONCLUSION: Prevention and proper management of Sickle cell disease and malaria reduces paediatric hospital stay in our environment. Paediatric emergency medicine should be re-organized to cater for high volume of off-hour admissions.
33504459	Complement in sickle cell disease and targeted therapy: I know one thing, that I know nothing.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a common inherited clinical syndrome, characterized by the presence of hemoglobin S. Anemia, susceptibility to infections and episodes of vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) are among its features. Since SCD complications (VOC or delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction/DHTR) lead to significant morbidity and mortality, a number of studies have addressed their pathophysiology Although SCD pathophysiology has been mainly attributed to the interaction between sickle cells and neutrophils, platelets or endothelial cells in small vessels leading to hemolysis, the role of complement activation has been increasingly investigated. Importantly, complement inhibition with eculizumab has shown beneficial effects in DHTR. Given the unmet clinical need of novel therapeutics in SCD, our review summarizes current understanding of (a) complement system for the clinician, (b) complement activation in SCD both in asymptomatic state and severe clinical manifestations, (c) probable underlying mechanisms of complement activation in SCD, and (d) new therapeutic perspective of complement inhibition.
33486484	Mortality and Hospitalizations among Sickle Cell Disease Patients with End-Stage Kidney Disease Initiating Dialysis.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common inherited hematological disorder and a well-described risk factor for end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Mortality and hospitalizations among patients with SCD who develop ESKD remain understudied. Furthermore, prior studies focused only on SCD patients where ESKD was caused by SCD. We aimed to describe mortality and hospitalization risk in all SCD patients initiating dialysis and explore risk factors for mortality and hospitalization. METHODS: We performed a national observational cohort study of African American ESKD patients initiating dialysis (2000-2014) in facilities affiliated with a large dialysis provider. SCD was identified by diagnosis codes and matched to a reference population (non-SCD) by age, sex, dialysis initiation year, and geographic region of care. Sensitivity analyses were conducted by restricting to patients where SCD was recorded as the cause of ESKD. RESULTS: We identified 504 SCD patients (mean age: 47 +- 14 years; 48% females) and 1,425 reference patients (mean age: 46 +- 14 years; 49% females). The median follow-up was 2.4 (IQR 1.0-4.5) years. Compared to the reference, SCD was associated with higher mortality risk (hazard ratio 1.66; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.36-2.03) and higher hospitalization rates (incidence rate ratio 2.12; 95% CI: 1.88-2.38) in multivariable analyses. Exploratory multivariable mortality risk models showed the largest mortality risk attenuation with the addition of time-varying hemoglobin and high-dose erythropoietin, but the association of SCD with mortality remained significant. Sensitivity analyses (restricted to ESKD caused by SCD) also showed significant associations between SCD and mortality and hospitalizations, but with larger effect estimates. High-dose erythropoietin was associated with the highest risk for mortality and hospitalization in SCD. CONCLUSIONS: Among ESKD patients, SCD is associated with a higher risk for mortality and hospitalization, particularly in patients where SCD is identified as the cause of ESKD.
37340519	Indian sickle cell disease registry for surveillance and patient management: Development and implementation.	In India, sickle cell disease (SCD) predominantly occurs in indigenous (tribal) people, who are about 104 million. However, screening and diagnosis seldom happen. This situation necessitates developing a comprehensive SCD care model, including a registry. This paper describes the development and implementation of the Indian SCD registry (ISCDR) in six tribal-dominated districts of India. The ISCDR was created in two components-(i) an Android-based mobile/tablet application, (ii) a dashboard/admin panel for patients' data management and retrieval. Data capture involves two electronic case report forms (CRF), that is, the primary form (CRF-1) and the repeat visit form (CRF-2). CRF-1 is completed as soon as the patient is found positive and captures the patient's information, including medical history, diagnosis, symptoms, precipitating factors, hospitalisation history and treatment received. Issues related to quality, security and data-sharing were addressed. After the screening system was functional, ISCDR was initiated. In 12 months, data of 324 SCD patients and 1771 carriers were entered. The study demonstrates the feasibility of establishing an SCD registry in India. It collects systematic longitudinal data on SCD patients, which are essential for programme planning and management. Further, it is feasible to scale up and integrate with other health management databases.
33674866	Pain Experiences of Adults With Sickle Cell Disease and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation: A Qualitative Study.	OBJECTIVE: Despite increasing use of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for adults with sickle cell disease (SCD), little is known about pain management experiences throughout this process. The objective of this study was to explore patients' experiences with pain and pain management during and after HSCT for SCD. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative interview study with 10 patients who underwent HSCT for SCD. We transcribed interviews verbatim and inductively identified codes. We used thematic analysis alongside a constant comparative method to develop and refine a codebook that aided in the identification of themes. RESULTS: Four key themes emerged. (1) The pain trajectory: patients described a fluctuating course of pain during HSCT, which often extended long afterwards and impacted all aspects of life, particularly affected by pre-HSCT experiences; (2) The role of opioids-a double-edged sword: patients described opioids as reducing pain but insufficiently to balance significant adverse effects and burden; (3) Patient-centered decision making in pain management: patients described insufficient agency in decisions about opioid use and weaning; and (4) Consequences of health-related stigma: patients described experiences with stigma, mainly related to opioid use and weaning, as similar to pre-HSCT. CONCLUSIONS: From the perspective of patients who have undergone HSCT for SCD, clinicians should use a patient-centered approach, integrating non-opioid approaches into pain management, particularly psychosocial support. As transplant for SCD becomes increasingly available, incorporating patient perspectives may improve health care delivery and overall patient experiences.
35360062	Testicular Tissue Banking for Fertility Preservation in Young Boys: Which Patients Should Be Included?	Due to the growing number of young patients at risk of germ cell loss, there is a need to preserve spermatogonial stem cells for patients who are not able to bank spermatozoa. Worldwide, more and more clinics are implementing testicular tissue (TT) banking programs, making it a novel, yet indispensable, discipline in the field of fertility preservation. Previously, TT cryopreservation was predominantly offered to young cancer patients before starting gonadotoxic chemo- or radiotherapy. Nowadays, most centers also bank TT from patients with non-malignant conditions who need gonadotoxic conditioning therapy prior to hematopoietic stem cell (HSCT) or bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Additionally, some centers include patients who suffer from genetic or developmental disorders associated with prepubertal germ cell loss or patients who already had a previous round of chemo- or radiotherapy. It is important to note that the surgical removal of TT is an invasive procedure. Moreover, TT cryopreservation is still considered experimental as restoration methods are not yet clinically available. For this reason, TT banking should preferably only be offered to patients who are at significant risk of becoming infertile. In our view, TT cryopreservation is recommended for young cancer patients in need of high-risk chemo- and/or radiotherapy, regardless of previous low-risk treatment. Likewise, TT banking is advised for patients with non-malignant disorders such as sickle cell disease, beta-thalassemia, and bone marrow failure, who need high-risk conditioning therapy before HSCT/BMT. TT retrieval during orchidopexy is also proposed for patients with bilateral cryptorchidism. Since patients with a medium- to low-risk treatment generally maintain their fertility, TT banking is not advised for this group. Also for Klinefelter patients, TT banking is not recommended as it does not give better outcomes than a testicular sperm extraction later in life.

35788087	Is Severity Score Associated With Indication for Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation in Individuals With Sickle Cell Anemia?	Manifestations of sickle cell disease (SCD) begin early in childhood and cause morbidity and decreased life expectancy. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is curative but associated with risk of mortality attributable to the transplant. This risk should be counterbalanced with SCD morbidity and mortality. A severity score using a Bayesian network model was previously validated to predict the risk of death in adult individuals with SCD. The objective of this study is to calculate the severity scores of participants in a multicenter cohort of Brazilians with SCD, using a previously published Bayesian network-derived score, associated with risk of death and then compare the severity scores between participants with and without an indication for HSCT as defined by the Brazilian Ministry of Health (MoH) criteria. This is an observational, retrospective study. We analyzed 2063 individuals with sickle cell anemia from the Recipient Epidemiology and Donor Evaluation Study-III Brazil SCD cohort and applied a Bayesian network-derived score to compare candidates and non-candidates for HSCT according to the Brazilian MoH transplant criteria. Classical statistical methods were used to analyze data and make comparisons. We compared severity scores between cohort members with (n = 431) and without (n = 1632) HSCT indications according to Brazilian MoH. Scores were not different in adult participants with >=1 HSCT indication when compared to those with no indication (mean 0.342 versus 0.292; median 0.194 versus 0.183, P = .354) and receiver operating characteristic curves did not demonstrate an obvious threshold to differentiate participants with or without HSCT indications. Severity score may predict risk of death but does not differentiate HSCT candidates. Current indications should be evaluated to ensure that patients with more severe disease who might benefit from HSCT are appropriately identified.

32790687	Outcomes following kidney transplantation in patients with sickle cell disease: The impact of automated exchange blood transfusion.	There are over 12,000 people with sickle cell disease (SCD) in the UK, and 4-12% of patients who develop Sickle Cell Nephropathy (SCN) progress to End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). Renal transplantation offers the best outcomes for these patients with but their access to transplantation is often limited. Regular automated exchange blood transfusions (EBT) reduce the complications of SCD and may improve outcomes. However, concerns over alloimmunisation limit its widespread implementation. In this retrospective multicenter study, data were collected on 34 SCD patients who received a kidney transplant across 6 London Hospitals between 1997 and 2017. 20/34 patients were on an EBT program, pre or post renal transplantation. Overall patient and graft survival were inferior to contemporaneous UK data in the ESRD population as a whole, a finding which is well-recognised. However, patient survival (CI 95%, p = 0.0032), graft survival and graft function were superior at all time-points in those who received EBT versus those who did not. 4/20 patients (20%) on EBT developed de novo donor specific antibodies (DSAs). 3/14 patients (21%) not on EBT developed de novo DSAs. The incidence of rejection in those on EBT was 5/18 (28%), as compared with 7/13 (54%) not on EBT. In conclusion, our data, while limited by an inevitably small sample size and differences in the date of transplantation, do suggest that long-term automated EBT post renal transplant is effective and safe, with improvement in graft and patient outcomes and no increase in antibody formation or graft rejection.
36240296	Reduction in vaso-occlusive events following stem cell transplantation in patients with sickle cell disease.	Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is potentially curative for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Patients with stable donor engraftment after allogeneic HSCT generally do not experience SCD-related complications; however, there are no published data specifically reporting the change in vaso-occlusive events (VOE) after HSCT. Data regarding the number of VOEs requiring medical attention in the 2 years before allogeneic HSCT were compared with the number of VOEs in the 2 years (0-12 months and 12-24 months) after allogeneic HSCT in patients with SCD. One-hundred sixty-three patients with SCD underwent allogeneic HSCT between 2005 and 2019. The average age at the time of HSCT was 21 years (range, 7 months - 64 years). Most patients underwent nonmyeloablative conditioning (75% [N = 123]) and had a matched sibling donor (72% [N = 118]). The mean number of VOEs was reduced from 5.6 (range, 0-52) in the 2 years before HSCT to 0.9 (range, 0-12) in the 2 years after HSCT (P < .001). Among the post-HSCT events, VOE was more frequent during the first 12 months (0.8 [range, 0-12]) than at 12 to 24 months after HSCT (0.1 [range, 0-8) (P < .001)). In patients who had graft rejection (12%, N = 20), VOEs were reduced from 6.6 (range, 0-24) before HSCT to 1.1 (range, 0-6) and 0.8 (range, 0-8) at 0 to 12 months and 12 to 24 months after HSCT, respectively (P < .001). VOEs requiring medical care were significantly reduced after allogeneic HSCT for patients with SCD. These data will inform the development of novel autologous HSCT gene therapy approaches.
38010293	Defining curative endpoints for sickle cell disease in the era of gene therapy and gene editing.	A growing number of gene therapy- and gene editing-based treatments for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) are entering clinical trials. These treatments, designed to target the underlying cause of SCD, have the potential to provide functional cures, which until now were possible only through allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. However, as these novel approaches advance from early- to late-stage clinical trials, it is essential to identify physiologically and clinically relevant endpoints that can demonstrate the achievement of a functional cure for SCD. Here, we present an overview of the pathophysiology of SCD and current treatment options, review ongoing SCD clinical trials using gene therapy or gene editing approaches, and identify the most relevant endpoints for demonstrating the attainment of a functional cure for SCD.
35708651	A Standardized Emergency Department Order Set Decreases Admission Rates and In-Patient Length of Stay for Adults Patients with Sickle Cell Disease.	INTRODUCTION: Pain associated with sickle cell disease (SCD) causes severe complications and frequent presentation to the emergency department (ED). Patients with SCD frequently report inadequate pain treatment in the ED, resulting in hospital admission. A retrospective analysis was conducted to assess a quality improvement project to standardize ED care for patients presenting with pain associated with SCD. METHODS: A 3-year prospective quality improvement initiative was performed. Our multidisciplinary team of providers implemented an ED order set in 2019 to improve care and provide adequate analgesia management. Our primary outcome was the overall hospital admission rate for patients after the intervention. Secondary outcome measures included ED disposition, rate of return to the ED within 72 hours, ED pain scores at admission and discharge, ED treatment time, in-patient length of stay, non-opioid medication use, and opioid medication use. RESULTS: There was an overall 67% reduction in the hospital admission rate after implementation of the order set (P = 0.005) and a significant decrease in the percentage admission rate month over month (P = 0.047). Time to the first non-opioid analgesic decreased by 71 minutes (P > 0.001), and there was no change in time to the first opioid medication. The rate of return to the ED within 72 hours remained unchanged (7.0% vs 7.1%) (P = 0.93), and the ED elopement rate remained unchanged (1.3% vs 1.85%) (P = 0.93). After the implementation, there were significant increases in the prescribing of orally administered acetaminophen (7%), celecoxib (1.2%), and tizanidine (12.5%) and intravenous ketamine (30.5%) and ketorolac (27%). ED pain scores at discharge were unchanged for both hospital-admitted (7.12 vs 7.08) (P = 0.93) and non-admitted (5.51 vs 6.11) (P = 0.27) patients. The resulting potential cost reduction was determined to be $193,440 during the 12-month observation period, with the mean cost per visit decreasing by $792. CONCLUSIONS: Use of a standardized and multimodal ED order set reduced hospital admission rates and the timeliness of analgesia without negatively impacting patients' pain.
34151636	Contemporary Management and Prevention of Vaso-Occlusive Crises (VOCs) in Adults With Sickle Cell Disease.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a hematological disorder that primarily affects individuals of African descent from sub-Saharan Africa and along the mediterranean. The main complications leading to hospitalizations include vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs) and acute chest syndrome (ACS). Therefore, the main objective of this paper was to identify and evaluate evidence-based management and prevention of VOCs in patients with SCD. A literature search of PubMed, Medline Cochrane and Google Scholar database (January 1985 to April 2020) was performed using the following search terms "vaso-occlusive crises", "sickle cell disease", "hydroxyurea", "L-glutamine", "voxelotor", "crizanlizumab", "treatment" and "prevention" as well as a combination of these terms. All English-language interventional studies assessing the efficacy and safety of VOC outcomes were evaluated. Literature was excluded if published in a language other than English or if it was a review article. A total of 69 articles were identified and there were 7 articles that met the search criteria. Majority of the studies focused on mean and median annual rates of VOCs as primary outcomes while median time to first sickle cell crises, median rates of hospitalizations etc were evaluated as secondary outcomes. After reviewing the literature, many patients with VOCs will still benefit from hydroxyurea therapy since long term efficacy data and cost is still a concern for the newer agents including L-glutamine, voxelotor and crizanlizumab. Other factors such as cost or compliance may also be taken into consideration when making recommendations for therapy.
32579245	Blood utilization and characteristics of patients treated with chronic transfusion therapy in a large cohort of Brazilian patients with sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions are used in sickle cell disease (SCD) to treat acute complications or as chronic transfusion therapy (CTT) to prevent severe manifestations. The objectives of this study were to describe blood utilization and adverse events (AEs) associated with RBCs in the Brazilian SCD population and compare characteristics of patients treated or not with CTT. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A SCD cohort was established at six Brazilian centers. Medical and blood bank records were abstracted for clinical and transfusion history. Two controls not treated with CTT matched on center, SCD genotype, sex, and age were selected for each CTT case within the cohort to compare characteristics between the two groups. RESULTS: Most of the 2794-member cohort had received a transfusion (75.0% of children and 89.2% of adults) with 29.2% of patients receiving transfusion in the prior year. There were 170 (10.6%) children and 115 (9.2%) adults treated with CTT. Children not treated with CTT were more likely to have pain and acute chest hospitalizations in the prior year (25.3% vs. 11.9%, p = 0.0003; and 22.0% vs. 10.7%, p = 0.002, respectively). Both iron overload and alloimmunization were more common in CTT cases compared to controls (65.6% vs. 17.0% and 36.2% vs. 15.9%, respectively). A higher proportion of adults treated with CTT demonstrated oxygen saturation of greater than 95% compared to controls not treated (51.1% vs. 39.2%), while there was no difference in oxygenation between children treated or not. Of 4501 transfusion episodes, 28 (0.62%) AEs were reported. There was no difference in AEs associated with transfusions for acute indications versus CTT. CONCLUSION: Red blood cell transfusion was common in Brazilian SCD patients, with utilization driven by CTT. Transfusion reactions were not common; however, alloimmunization and iron overload were frequent among those on CTT, highlighting the need for novel clinical strategies to mitigate these risks.
31665139	Investigating the potential of the secretome of mesenchymal stem cells derived from sickle cell disease patients.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a monogenic red cell disorder associated with multiple vascular complications, microvessel injury and wound-healing deficiency. Although stem cell transplantation with bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSC) can promote wound healing and tissue repair in SCD patients, therapeutic efficacy is largely dependent on the paracrine activity of the implanted BM stromal cells. Since in vitro expansion and culture conditions are known to modulate the innate characteristics of BMSCs, the present study investigated the effects of normoxic and hypoxic cell-culture preconditioning on the BMSC secretome, in addition to the expression of paracrine molecules that induce angiogenesis and skin regeneration. BMSCs derived from SCD patients were submitted to culturing under normoxic (norCM) and hypoxic (hypoCM) conditions. We found that hypoxically conditioned cells presented increased expression and secretion of several well-characterized trophic growth factors (VEGF, IL8, MCP-1, ANG) directly linked to angiogenesis and tissue repair. The hypoCM secretome presented stronger angiogenic potential than norCM, both in vitro and in vivo, as evidenced by HUVEC proliferation, survival, migration, sprouting formation and in vivo angiogenesis. After local application in a murine wound-healing model, HypoCM showed significantly improved wound closure, as well as enhanced neovascularization in comparison to untreated controls. In sum, the secretome of hypoxia-preconditioned BMSC has increased expression of trophic factors involved in angiogenesis and skin regeneration. Considering that these preconditioned media are easily obtainable, this strategy represents an alternative to stem cell transplantation and could form the basis of novel therapies for vascular regeneration and wound healing in individuals with sickle cell disease.
37458568	Return visit rates after an emergency department discharge for children with sickle cell pain episodes.	BACKGROUND: High return visit rates after hospitalization for people with sickle cell disease (SCD) have been previously established. Due to a lack of multicenter emergency department (ED) return visit rate data, the return visit rate following ED discharge for pediatric SCD pain treatment is currently unknown. PROCEDURE: A seven-site retrospective cohort study of discharged ED visits for pain by children with SCD was conducted using the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network Registry. Visits between January 2017 and November 2021 were identified using previously validated criteria. The primary outcome was the 14-day return visit rate, with 3- and 7-day rates also calculated. Modified Poisson regression was used to analyze associations for age, sex, initial hospitalization rate, and a visit during the COVID-19 pandemic with return visit rates. RESULTS: Of 2548 eligible ED visits, approximately 52% were patients less than 12 years old, 50% were female, and over 95% were non-Hispanic Black. The overall 14-day return visit rate was 29.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 27.4%-30.9%; site range 22.7%-31.7%); the 7- and 3-day return visit rates were 23.0% (95% CI: 21.3%-24.6%) and 16.7% (95% CI: 15.3%-18.2%), respectively. Younger children had slightly lower 14-day return visit rates (27.3% vs. 31.1%); there were no associations for site hospitalization rate, sex, and a visit occurring during the pandemic with 14-day returns. CONCLUSION: Nearly 30% of ED discharged visits after SCD pain treatment had a return visit within 14 days. Increased efforts are needed to identify causes for high ED return visit rates and ensure optimal ED and post-ED care.
33225591	Predictors of dental complications post-dental treatment in patients with sickle cell disease.	OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to explore potential medical or dental indicators associated with dental complications and the utilization of emergency services in sickle cell disease (SCD), especially that clinical reports on adverse outcomes post-dental treatment are scarce. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of dental treatments of 47 eligible adults with confirmed SCD between May 2016 and October 2019. Logistic regression analysis was used whether clinical outcomes, course of dental treatment, and regularity of dental care are associated with dental complications after dental procedures and/or resulted in emergency care or hospital admissions. RESULTS: We identified a new, statistically significant association (p-value = .01) between the number of prescription medications taken and complications (10%) after dental procedures. The most frequent dental procedures were tooth extractions (36%) and pain management (28%) during a non-scheduled dental encounter (68%). The majority of cases did not participate in regular recall exams and periodical oral hygiene maintenance. CONCLUSIONS: A higher number of prescription medications was associated with an increased risk of post-dental complications in SCD patients. A thorough medical history, including a list of prescribed medications, and collaboration with the patient medical team are important to assess the risk of complications post-dental procedures and the need for antibiotic prophylaxis according to the case complexity.
33275730	Neuropathic pain in sickle cell disease: measurement and management.	The identification of chronic pain and neuropathic pain as common contributors to the overall pain experience of patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) has altered the way we should evaluate difficult-to-treat pain. The recognition of these 2 entities is not generally routine among various medical specialties and provider levels that treat SCD. Due to the relative recency with which neuropathic pain was first described in SCD, validated assessment tools and evidence-based treatments remain lacking. Although clinical assessment and judgment must continue to inform all decision making in this understudied area of SCD pain management, a number of validated neuropathic pain assessment tools exist that can make possible a standardized evaluation process. Similarly, investigation of available neuropathic pain treatments for the uniquely complex pain phenotypes of SCD has only just begun and is better established in pain conditions other than SCD. The aim of this review is to briefly summarize the proposed basic pathophysiology, assessment, and treatment of neuropathic pain in patients with SCD. Furthermore, the aim of this review is to encourage an expanded framework for the assessment and treatment of SCD pain that appreciates the hidden complexities of this common complication of SCD.
35194011	Sickle Cell Trait and SARS-CoV-2-Induced Rhabdomyolysis: A Case Report.	BACKGROUND Rhabdomyolysis is a syndrome characterized by muscle necrosis and the subsequent release of intracellular muscle constituents into the bloodstream. Although the specific cause is frequently evident from the history or from the immediate events, such as a trauma, extraordinary physical exertion, or a recent infection, sometimes there are hidden risk factors that have to be identified. For instance, individuals with sickle cell trait (SCT) have been reported to be at increased risk for rare conditions, including rhabdomyolysis. Moreover, there have been a few case reports of SARS-CoV-2 infection-related rhabdomyolysis. CASE REPORT We present a case of a patient affected by unknown SCT and admitted with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, who suffered non-traumatic non-exertional rhabdomyolysis leading to acute kidney injury (AKI), requiring acute hemodialysis (HD). The patients underwent 13 dialysis session, of which 12 were carried out using an HFR-Supra H dialyzer. He underwent kidney biopsy, where rhabdomyolysis injury was ascertained. No viral traces were found on kidney biopsy samples. The muscle biopsy showed the presence of an "open nucleolus" in the muscle cell, which was consistent with virus-infected cells. After 40 days in the hospital, his serum creatinine was 1.62 mg/dL and CPK and Myoglobin were 188 U/L and 168 ng/mL, respectively; therefore, the patient was discharged. CONCLUSIONS SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in severe rhabdomyolysis with AKI requiring acute HD. Since SARS-CoV-2 infection can trigger sickle-related complications like rhabdomyolysis, the presence of SCT needs to be ascertained in African patients.
32007639	Goal-Oriented Monitoring of Cyclosporine Is Effective for Graft-versus-Host Disease Prevention after Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation in Sickle Cell Disease and Thalassemia Major.	Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is an important challenge and a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children after hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Herein we report our institution's experience of goal-oriented Bayesian monitoring for cyclosporine (CsA) used alone as GVHD prophylaxis during the post-transplant period in pediatric patients with thalassemia major (TM) or sickle cell anemia (SCA) undergoing HLA-matched HSCT. We also studied evolution of chimerism. Twenty-six consecutive patients (SCA, 14; TM, 12) underwent matched sibling donor (MSD) HSCT from 2004 to 2014. All patients received a myeloablative conditioning regimen. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of 20 mg/kg antithymocyte globulin in the conditioning regimens and then CsA alone in the post-transplant period. Target CsA trough blood concentration (TBC) was 150 +- 20 ng/mL. At last follow-up, all patients were alive and free of disease, even in cases of mixed chimerism. Engraftment occurred in all patients. No patient developed grades II to IV acute GVHD, 4 patients developed acute grade I skin GVHD, and only 1 presented with chronic pulmonary GVHD. A better control of GVHD and immunosuppression by a strict monitoring of CsA TBC as described herein is promising and could play a crucial role. Further investigations are required, but this study opens new perspectives to improve survival and safety of HSCT from alternative donors in TM and SCA to levels compatible with that obtained with MSDs.
32394268	Acute care utilization in pediatric sickle cell disease and sickle cell trait in the USA: prevalence, temporal trends, and cost.	The objective of this study was to analyze acute care utilization of sickle cell disease (SCD) and sickle cell trait (SCT) in children and identify trends in emergency department (ED) visits and inpatient admissions over a 10-year period. This is a retrospective population-based study of SCD- and SCT-related ED visits and admissions from 2006 to 2015. Data were acquired from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP), National Inpatient Sample (NIS), and National Emergency Department Sample (NEDS) database. Cost-to-charge and estimated professional fee ratios were applied to approximate costs. Over 80% of medical expenditure on HbSS is through ED-based admissions. There is a statistically significant increase from 2006 to 2015 in the direct hospital admissions associated with patients less than 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with SCT.Conclusion: Among patients less than 18 years of age with HbSS, inpatient admissions through the emergency department accounted for the largest medical expenditure of the SCD subtypes. What is Known:   There are currently no multi-year, nationwide analyses of acute care utilization in sickle cell disease and sickle cell trait (SCT) in the pediatric population.   SCT is more common than SCD, affecting 1.5% of all infants born in the USA. What is New:   Comprehensive annual costs of acute care utilization of patients less than 18 years of age with SCD and SCT in the USA which includes aggregated demographical patient care data and to illustrate temporal trends of acute care utilization in children less than 18 years of age with SCD and SCT   Among patients less than 18 years of age with HbSS, inpatient admissions through the emergency department accounted for the largest medical expenditure of the sickle cell disease subtypes.
37952647	Improvement in cardiac morphology demonstrated by CMR and echo after haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplant in adults with sickle cell disease.	Cardiopulmonary complications account for approximately 40% of deaths in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Diffuse myocardial fibrosis, elevated tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity (TRV) and iron overload are all associated with early mortality. While HLA-matched sibling hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) offers a potential cure, fewer than 20% of patients have a suitable donor. Haploidentical HCT allows for an increased donor pool and has recently demonstrated improved safety and efficacy. Our group has reported improved cardiac morphology via echocardiography at one year after HCT. Herein, we describe the first use of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR), the gold standard for measuring volume, mass, and ventricular function, to evaluate changes in cardiac morphology post-HCT in adults with SCD. We analyzed baseline and 1-year data from 12 adults with SCD who received nonmyeloablative haploidentical peripheral blood HCT at the NIH. Patients underwent non-contrast CMR at 3T, echocardiography, and laboratory studies. One year after HCT, patients showed marked improvement in cardiac chamber morphology by CMR, including left ventricular (LV) mass and volume (70.2 to 60.1 g/m2, p = 0.02; 114.5 to 90.6 mL/m2, p = 0.001). Furthermore, mean TRV normalized by 1 year, suggesting that HCT may offer a survival benefit. Fewer patients had pathologically prolonged native myocardial T1 times, an indirect marker of myocardial fibrosis at 1 year; these data showed a trend toward significance. In this small sample, CMR was very sensitive in detecting cardiac mass and volume changes after HCT and provided complementary information to echocardiography. Notably, post-HCT improvement in cardiac parameters can be attributed only in part to the resolution of anemia; further studies are required to determine the role of myocardial fibrosis reversal, improved blood flow, and survival impact after HCT for SCD.
36089470	Haploidentical stem cell transplantation for patients with sickle cell disease: current status.	For patients with high-risk sickle cell disease (SCD) without any available matched sibling or unrelated donor, haploidentical stem cell transplantation (haploHCT) expands the availability of this life-saving intervention to nearly all patients who may benefit from HCT. The greatest challenge in haploHCT has been the significant risk of graft failure. Developing a treatment modality which sustains engraftment without increasing the incidence of debilitating graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) remains the ultimate goal. A number of modifications have been explored to overcome the high incidence of graft rejection and severe GvHD including: (1) ex-vivo T-cell depletion (via CD34+ selection, CD3+/CD19+, or TCRalphabeta+/CD19+ depletion), and (2) in vivo T-cell depletion using unmanipulated grafts followed by post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) for GvHD prophylaxis. Furthermore, the presence of donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies (DSA) has been associated with an increased risk of both graft failure and poor graft function. Several approaches for desensitization ameliorate this risk when a suitable donor without DSA is not available. In addition to advances in supportive care, the recent demonstration that stable mixed chimerism post-HCT sufficiently sustains symptom-free status has opened the door for less toxic treatment approaches yielding excellent survival outcomes. Though late effects remain uncertain, the goal of finding the least toxic conditioning regimen while providing the highest rate of donor engraftment draws closer within reach. In this review, the authors aim to present the latest findings, challenges, and treatment modalities of this life-saving modality.
35583381	Assessment of donor cell engraftment after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for sickle cell disease: A review of current and future methods.	Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only established curative treatment for sickle cell disease (SCD), a debilitating red blood cell (RBC) disorder with significant prevalence worldwide. Accurate assessment of RBC engraftment following HSCT is essential to evaluate the status of the graft and can enable early intervention to treat or prevent graft rejection. Currently, chimerism measurement is performed on whole blood samples, which mainly reflect white blood cell (WBC) chimerism. This approach has limitations in assessing engraftment in patients with SCD because RBCs engraft non-linearly with WBCs. Direct measures of RBC chimerism exist but are not routinely used. In this review, we critically examine the current methodologies for assessing donor engraftment; highlight the limitations of these different methods, and present emerging and novel technologies with the potential to improve clinical monitoring of RBC engraftment post-HSCT for SCD. Promising alternative methodologies include RBC-specific flow cytometry, RBC-specific RNA analysis, and quantification of plasma cell-free DNA derived specifically from nucleated RBCs.
33785253	Treatment of aseptic osteonecrosis of the femoral head: Historical aspects.	The treatment of aseptic osteonecrosis (ON) of the femoral head has been the subject of numerous therapeutic and surgical proposals due to the absence of medical treatment with proven efficacy. For many years, the goal of surgical treatment was to avoid total hip replacement (THR) with uncertain survival in patients considered too young (30-50 years) for this procedure. Numerous conservative treatments were thus proposed: core decompression with numerous variants, non-vascularized and vascularized bone grafts, intertrochanteric and rotational transtrochanteric osteotomies, cementing. The lack of a common classification and a lack of knowledge of natural history complicated the interpretation of the results for a long time. Nevertheless, it appeared that these treatments were effective only in the very early stages and among these in the limited ONs, medial rather than central and especially lateral, with discrepancies according to etiologies apart from sickle cell disease recognized by all as being pejorative. For the same reason, partial arthroplasties have been attempted and abandoned in turn: femoral head total and partial resurfacing and femoral prosthesis. The most recent advances are stem-cell-enhanced core decompression and progress in total arthroplasty, whose reliability has made it possible to extend the indications to increasingly younger patients seeking treatment with guaranteed or near-guaranteed efficacy. Most of the other interventions have disappeared or almost disappeared because of their lack of effectiveness especially in extensive and post-fracture ONs, sometimes because of their complexity and the length of their post-operative management, and also because they complicate and penalize a future total arthroplasty. This argues for early detection of ON at an early stage where the "head can be saved" by stem cell augmented core decompression, a minimally invasive treatment that leaves the chances of success of a THR intact.
37290934	Outcomes of COVID-19 hospitalizations in patients with sickle cell disease: A nationwide analysis.	INTRODUCTION: There is a paucity of data on the outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) in the United States. We examined the outcomes of patients with COVID-19 and SCD. METHODS: We utilized the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) to identify the data of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and SCD in 2020 using the International Classification of Disease, Tenth Revision codes. In-hospital outcomes (invasive mechanical ventilation and mortality) were compared between SCD and non-SCD groups. RESULTS: Of the 1 057 550 COVID-19 hospitalizations, 2870 (0.3%) had SCD. The median age of the SCD group was 42 (IQR: 31) vs. 66 (IQR: 23) in the non-SCD group (p < .0001). Patients with SCD were likely to be females (62.02% vs. 37.98%, p < .0001), Blacks (87.81% vs. 12.19%, p < .0001), and in the lowest income quartile (50.62% vs. 11.15%, p < .0001). There was no difference in the outcomes between the two groups. There were increased odds of invasive mechanical ventilation and in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 in Asians, Hispanics, Native Americans, and Blacks (except for in-hospital mortality) compared to Whites. CONCLUSION: In-hospital mortality and invasive mechanical ventilation outcomes in SCD are comparable to that in non-SCD patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
35087158	Machine learning-based approaches for identifying human blood cells harboring CRISPR-mediated fetal chromatin domain ablations.	Two common hemoglobinopathies, sickle cell disease (SCD) and beta-thalassemia, arise from genetic mutations within the beta-globin gene. In this work, we identified a 500-bp motif (Fetal Chromatin Domain, FCD) upstream of human Upsilon-globin locus and showed that the removal of this motif using CRISPR technology reactivates the expression of Upsilon-globin. Next, we present two different cell morphology-based machine learning approaches that can be used identify human blood cells (KU-812) that harbor CRISPR-mediated FCD genetic modifications. Three candidate models from the first approach, which uses multilayer perceptron algorithm (MLP 20-26, MLP26-18, and MLP 30-26) and flow cytometry-derived cellular data, yielded 0.83 precision, 0.80 recall, 0.82 accuracy, and 0.90 area under the ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve when predicting the edited cells. In comparison, the candidate model from the second approach, which uses deep learning (T2D5) and DIC microscopy-derived imaging data, performed with less accuracy (0.80) and ROC AUC (0.87). We envision that equivalent machine learning-based models can complement currently available genotyping protocols for specific genetic modifications which result in morphological changes in human cells.
35365364	Frequency of Opioid Prescription Filling After Discharge from the Pediatric Emergency Department.	BACKGROUND: Little is known about prescription filling of pain medicine for children. In adult populations, race and insurance type are associated with differences in opioid prescription fill rate. We hypothesize that known disparities in pain management for children are exacerbated by the differential rates of opioid prescription filling between patients based on age and race. OBJECTIVE: To determine if there are demographic or clinical factors associated with differences in opioid prescription fill rates after discharge from the pediatric emergency department (ED). METHODS: This was a retrospective cross-sectional study of all patients younger than 19 years discharged with an opioid prescription from either of two pediatric EDs in 2018. We performed multivariable logistic regression to measure associations between prescription filling and demographic and clinical factors. RESULTS: There were 287 patient visits in which opioids were prescribed. Forty percent of prescriptions were filled. The majority of patients were male (53%), black (69%), and had public insurance (55%). There were no significant associations between prescription filling and age, insurance status, or race/ethnicity. Patients with sickle cell disease were more likely to fill prescriptions (odds ratio 3.87, 95% confidence interval 2.33-6.43) and patients without an identified primary care provider were less likely to fill prescriptions (odds ratio 0.16, 95% confidence interval 0.03-0.84). CONCLUSION: Less than half of opioid prescriptions prescribed at discharge from a pediatric emergency department are filled. Patient age, insurance status, and race/ethnicity are not associated with opioid prescription filling. Patients with sickle cell disease and those with a primary care provider are more likely to fill their opioid prescriptions.
37216689	New ASH initiatives to improve patient care of the long-overlooked Sickle Cell Disease.	Due to the unique biology of sickle cell disease, as well as the societal disadvantages and racial inequities suffered by these patients, individuals with sickle cell disease have not benefited from the same remarkable advances in care and therapeutics as other hematologic disorders. Life expectancy of individuals with sickle cell disease is shortened by approximately 20 years even with optimal clinical care, and infant mortality continues to be a major concern in low-income countries. As hematologists, we must do more. ASH and the ASH Research Collaborative have instituted a multi-pronged initiative to improve the lives of individuals living with this disease. Here we describe two components of this ASH initiative, the Consortium on Newborn Screening in Africa (CONSA) to improve early diagnosis of infants in low-resource countries, and the Sickle Cell Disease Clinical Trial Network to accelerate the development of more effective therapeutics and care for those with this disorder. The combination of sickle cell disease-focused initiatives, the ASH Research Collaborative, CONSA, and the Sickle Cell Clinical Trials Network, have enormous potential to dramatically alter the course of sickle cell disease worldwide. We believe that the timing is ripe to embark on these critical and worthwhile initiatives and improve the lives of individuals with this disease.
34418379	Contraceptive use and preferences among females with sickle cell disease.	OBJECTIVES: Females with sickle cell disease now have a life expectancy that extends well into and beyond their reproductive years. Pregnancy and childbirth are accompanied by high morbidity and mortality in this population, rendering contraception a critical part of their health care. STUDY DESIGN: We approached adult female patients of the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania hematology clinic who were of reproductive age (ages 18-45) and carried a diagnosis of sickle cell disease. We evaluated contraceptive method uptake and method characteristic preferences, as well as other reproductive history, and compared contraceptive uptake rates to that from female respondent data from the National Survey of Family Growth (2017-2019). RESULTS: Of 95 eligible patients, we completed surveys with 48 participants (response rate of 51%). Over half (n = 27, 56%) of participants were not currently using any form of contraception-double the rate of the general United States population (25%). The most common contraceptives currently used were the depot medroxyprogesterone (DMPA) injection (n = 6, 13%) and the progestin intrauterine device (IUD) (n = 6, 13%). DMPA uptake was significantly higher, and permanent contraceptive and oral contraceptive pill uptake significantly lower, among these participants with sickle cell disease compared to the general United States population. Participants' preferred contraceptive characteristics included effectiveness (n = 39, 81%), control over when to use the contraceptive (n = 39, 81%), and lack of side effects (n = 38, 79%). CONCLUSIONS: Contraceptive uptake was significantly lower and method mix different among females with sickle cell disease compared to the general United States population. Further research is needed on contraceptive safety, non-contraceptive benefits, and contraceptive decision-making for females with sickle cell disease. IMPLICATIONS: This study sheds light on the contraceptive choices and preferences of females with sickle cell disease, who are at disproportionate risk for pregnancy complications. In order to maximize the reproductive health of females with sickle cell disease, we must consider how their disease interacts with contraception and better understand how they approach contraceptive decision-making.
32672889	Cost of health care for paediatric patients with sickle cell disease: An analysis of resource use and costs in a European country.	BACKGROUND: While multiple studies have examined the cost of health care for one aspect of sickle cell disease care, few have focussed on the overall cost of comprehensive care for sickle cell disease. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of children with sickle cell disease treated in a comprehensive care centre from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2016. Health care utilisation of included patients was based upon data from two main sources. The clinical practice guideline was used to determine the expected resource use of routine comprehensive care (planned elective care), and the financial claims database was used to estimate real-world resource use associated with acute and inpatient care (additional care). RESULTS: A total of 125 children with sickle cell disease were analysed. Expenditures for these patients averaged $5049 [standard deviation (SD) $1634] per child per year. Total yearly costs per patient varied considerably, ranging from $669 to $84 010, and less than 15% of patients were responsible for 50% of the health care costs. The majority (37%) of costs was associated with inpatient hospital care, which increased by age group, 27% with diagnostics, 19% with treatment, 11% with outpatients' visits and 6% with emergency care. CONCLUSION: We have described real-world resource use and expenditures for children with sickle cell disease in a European comprehensive care centre. It seems that costs of a comprehensive approach with effective management in the outpatient setting is favourable when compared to episodic health care.
34196678	Comorbidities are risk factors for hospitalization and serious COVID-19 illness in children and adults with sickle cell disease.	Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) are at high risk of developing serious infections, therefore, understanding the impact that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection has on this population is important. We sought to identify factors associated with hospitalization and serious COVID-19 illness in children and adults with SCD.We established the international SECURE-SCD Registry to collect data on patients with SCD and COVID-19 illness. We used multivariable logistic models to estimate the independent effects of age, sex, genotype, hydroxyurea, and SCD-related and -nonrelated comorbidities on hospitalization, serious COVID-19 illness, and pain as a presenting symptom during COVID-19 illness. As of 23 March 2021, 750 COVID-19 illness cases in patients with SCD were reported to the registry. We identified history of pain (relative risk [RR], 2.15; P < .0001) and SCD heart/lung comorbidities (RR, 1.61; P = .0001) as risk factors for hospitalization in children. History of pain (RR, 1.78; P = .002) was also a risk factor for hospitalization in adults. Children with history of pain (RR, 3.09; P = .009), SCD heart/lung comorbidities (RR, 1.76; P = .03), and SCD renal comorbidities (RR, 3.67; P < .0001) and adults with history of pain (RR 1.94, P = .02) were at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness. History of pain and SCD renal comorbidities also increased risk of pain during COVID-19 in children; history of pain, SCD heart/lung comorbidities, and female sex increased risk of pain during COVID-19 in adults. Hydroxyurea showed no effect on hospitalization and COVID-19 severity, but it lowered the risk of presenting with pain in adults during COVID-19.

37350061	Vaccination in sickle cell disease: Immunocompromised or immunocompetent?	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an immunocompromised condition and patients with SCD may have a reduced immune response to certain vaccinations. The report by Nakahara et al. demonstrated that SCD patients exhibited elevated and more sustained IgG production following COVID-19 vaccination, when compared to healthy controls. This suggests that the immune response to vaccinations may vary among different types of vaccines in individuals with SCD. Commentary on: Nakahara et al.

35666654	Management of acute chest syndrome in patients with sickle cell disease: a systematic review of randomized clinical trials.	INTRODUCTION: Acute chest syndrome (ACS) accounts for the highest mortality in Sickle cell disease patients. Early diagnosis and timely management of ACS results in better outcomes. However, the effectiveness of most treatment modalities for ACS management has not been established. AREAS COVERED: To review the treatment modalities management protocols and highlight the effectiveness of each option a literature search was done. Randomized controlled trials that assessed the efficacy of different treatment modalities in ACS management in SCD patients were chosen and reviewed. EXPERT OPINION: 11 randomized controlled trials were found that evaluated the efficacy of incentive spirometry, positive expiratory pressure device, intravenous dexamethasone, oral vs. intravenous morphine, inhaled nitric oxide, unfractionated heparin, and blood transfusion in the prevention or treatment of ACS. Although there are guidelines for ACS treatment, the available evidence is very limited to delineating the effectiveness of various interventions in ACS management. More high-quality studies and trials with a larger patient population can benefit this area to support the recommendations with stronger evidence.
33315547	Spellchecking for the Story of Life With CRISPR-Cas9 and Base, Prime Editors.	Just four letters-A, G, T, and C-make up the alphabet of the genome. It may seem simple, but a small difference in spelling can create mutations that result in life-threatening diseases. Gene variants that cause genetic diseases come in many varieties. Transition point mutations cause conditions such as progeria, the rapid aging disease. Transversion point mutations cause sickle-cell disease and other major disorders. Small insertions can cause Tay-Sachs, which stops nerves working properly and is usually fatal, and deletions can result in cystic fibrosis.
36134546	Risk of COVID-19 hospitalizations among school-aged children in Scotland: A national incident cohort study.	Background: There is considerable policy, clinical and public interest about whether children should be vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 and, if so, which children should be prioritised (particularly if vaccine resources are limited). To inform such deliberations, we sought to identify children and young people at highest risk of hospitalization from COVID-19. Methods: We used the Early Pandemic Evaluation and Enhanced Surveillance of COVID-19 (EAVE II) platform to undertake a national incident cohort analysis to investigate the risk of hospitalization among 5-17 years old living in Scotland in risk groups defined by the living risk prediction algorithm (QCOVID). A Cox proportional hazard model was used to derive hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between risk groups and COVID-19 hospital admission. Adjustments were made for age, sex, socioeconomic status, co-morbidity, and prior hospitalization. Results: Between March 1, 2020 and November 22, 2021, there were 146 183 (19.4% of all 752 867 children in Scotland) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections among 5-17 years old. Of those with confirmed infection, 973 (0.7%) were admitted to hospital with COVID-19. The rate of COVID-19 hospitalization was higher in those within each QCOVID risk group compared to those without the condition. Similar results were found in age stratified analyses (5-11 and 12-17 years old). Risk groups associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 hospital admission, included (adjusted HR, 95% CIs): sickle cell disease 14.35 (8.48-24.28), chronic kidney disease 11.34 (4.61-27.87), blood cancer 6.32 (3.24-12.35), rare pulmonary diseases 5.04 (2.58-9.86), type 2 diabetes 3.04 (1.34-6.92), epilepsy 2.54 (1.69-3.81), type 1 diabetes 2.48 (1.47-4.16), Down syndrome 2.45 (0.96-6.25), cerebral palsy 2.37 (1.26-4.47), severe mental illness 1.43 (0.63-3.24), fracture 1.41 (1.02-1.95), congenital heart disease 1.35 (0.82-2.23), asthma 1.28 (1.06-1.55), and learning disability (excluding Down syndrome) 1.08 (0.82-1.42), when compared to those without these conditions. Although our Cox models were adjusted for a number of potential confounders, residual confounding remains a possibility. Conclusions: In this national study, we observed an increased risk of COVID-19 hospital admissions among school-aged children with specific underlying long-term health conditions compared with children without these conditions.

36244884	Combining PTCy and ATG for GvHD prophylaxis in non-malignant diseases.	Bone marrow transplantation for non-malignant diseases such as aplastic anemia and hemoglobinopathies is a burgeoning clinical area. The goal of these transplants is to correct the hematopoietic defect with as little toxicity as possible. This requires mitigation of transplant-specific toxicities such as graft versus host disease, given this is not needed in non-malignant disorders. This review details current clinical outcomes in the field with a focus on post-transplantation cyclophosphamide and anti-thymoglobulin as intensive graft versus host disease prophylaxis to achieve that goal.
36560719	The Optimized gamma-Globin Lentiviral Vector GGHI-mB-3D Leads to Nearly Therapeutic HbF Levels In Vitro in CD34+ Cells from Sickle Cell Disease Patients.	We have previously demonstrated that both the original gamma-globin lentiviral vector (LV) GGHI and the optimized GGHI-mB-3D LV, carrying the novel regulatory elements of the 3D HPFH-1 enhancer and the 3' beta-globin UTR, can significantly increase HbF production in thalassemic CD34+ cells and ameliorate the disease phenotype in vitro. In the present study, we investigated whether the GGHI-mB-3D vector can also exhibit an equally therapeutic effect, following the transduction of sickle cell disease (SCD) CD34+ cells at MOI 100, leading to HbF increase coupled with HbS decrease, and thus, to phenotype improvement in vitro. We show that GGHI-mB-3D LV can lead to high and potentially therapeutic HbF levels, reaching a mean 2-fold increase to a mean value of VCN/cell of 1.0 and a mean transduction efficiency of 55%. Furthermore, this increase was accompanied by a significant 1.6-fold HbS decrease, a beneficial therapeutic feature for SCD. In summary, our data demonstrate the efficacy of the optimized gamma-globin lentiviral vector to improve the SCD phenotype in vitro, and highlights its potential use in future clinical SCD trials.
34600645	Exploring the Use of Exchange Transfusion in the Surgical Management of Priapism in Sickle Cell Disease: A Population-Based Analysis.	INTRODUCTION: Priapism is a urologic emergency that may require surgical intervention in cases refractory to supportive care. Exchange transfusion (ET) has been previously used to manage sickle cell disease (SCD), including in priapism; however, its utilization in the context of surgical intervention has not been well-established. AIM: To explore the utilization of ET, as well as other patient and hospital-level factors, associated with surgical intervention for SCD-induced priapism METHODS: Using the National Inpatient Sample (2010-2015), males diagnosed with SCD and priapism were stratified by need for surgical intervention. Survey-weighted regression models were used to analyze the association of ET to surgical intervention. Furthermore, negative binomial regression and generalized linear models with logarithmic transformation were used to compare ET vs surgery to length of hospital stay (LOS) and total hospital charges, respectively. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Predictors of surgical intervention among patients with SCD-related priapism RESULTS: A weighted total of 8,087 hospitalizations were identified, with 1,782 (22%) receiving surgical intervention for priapism, 484 undergoing ET (6.0%), and 149 (1.8%) receiving combined therapy of both ET and surgery. On multivariable regression, pre-existing Elixhauser comorbidities (e.g. >=2 Elixhauser: OR: 2.20; P < 0.001), other forms of insurance (OR: 2.12; P < 0.001), and ET (OR: 1.99; P = 0.009) had increased odds of undergoing surgical intervention. In contrast, Black race (OR: 0.45; P < 0.001) and other co-existing SCD complications (e.g. infectious complications OR: 0.52; P < 0.001) reduced such odds. Compared to supportive care alone, patients undergoing ET (adjusted IRR: 1.42; 95% CI: 1.10-1.83; P = 0.007) or combined therapy (adjusted IRR: 1.42; 95% CI: 111-1.82; P < 0.001) had a longer LOS vs. surgery alone (adjusted IRR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.74-0.97; P = 0.017). Patients receiving ET (adjusted Ratio: 2.39; 95% CI: 1.52-3.76; P < 0.001) or combined therapy (adjusted Ratio: 4.42; 95% CI: 1.67-11.71; P = 0.003) had higher ratio of mean hospital charges compared with surgery alone (adjusted Ratio: 1.09; 95% CI: 0.69-1.72; P = 0.710). CONCLUSIONS: Numerous factors were associated with the need for surgical intervention, including the use of ET. Those receiving ET, as well as those with combined therapy, had a longer LOS and increased total hospital charges. Ha AS, Wallace BK, Miles C, et al.

33408108	Bone marrow necrosis and fat embolism syndrome: a near fatal complication in previously undiagnosed sickle beta + thalassaemia.	Prevalence of haemoglobin sickle-beta+ thalassaemia (Hb S/beta+thal) is variable with geography ranging from 0.2% to 10% among sickle cell patients. Clinical presentation of Hb S/beta+thal patients depends on HbA level, with milder disease often going undiagnosed. However, rarely these patients can present with a fulminant vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC). Given VOC can present with non-specific symptoms, the diagnosis and treatment is often delayed. Here, we present a patient who initially developed altered mental status, pancytopenia and multiorgan failure due a critical VOC resulting in bone marrow necrosis and fat embolism. Subsequent workup confirmed that our patient had Sickle-beta+ thalassaemia, which had gone undiagnosed, despite subclinical evidence of haemolysis on routine lab work for years. Following diagnosis and initiation of RBC exchange, he improved significantly and was discharged home. High index of suspicion and bone marrow biopsy is vital for early diagnosis and management of this rare condition.
36481614	IF IM in a crisis: Intranasal fentanyl versus intravenous morphine in adult vaso-occlusive crisis.	IMPORTANCE: Studies have demonstrated the benefits of INF in reducing pain scores in pediatric patients with VOC due to sickle cell disease (SCD) and in adult patients with chronic pain conditions other than VOC, such as cancer. However, there is limited literature that exists describing the role of INF in adult patients with VOC due to SCD. Current literature demonstrates that the use of IV morphine for VOC patients leads to reduced pain. Therefore, comparing the use of INF with IV morphine will establish the degree of effectiveness of INF for VOC patients. OBJECTIVE: To determine if intranasal fentanyl is equally as effective as IV morphine for treating VOC-associated pain in adult SCD patients. DESIGN: This study was a retrospective non-inferiority cohort study. Electronic health records were utilized to identify eligible patients between January 1, 2021 to February 28, 2022. Patients who received INF as an initial opioid upon presentation to the ED where allocated to the intervention group. On the other hand, individuals who received IV morphine as an initial opioid upon presentation to the ED were allocated to the control group. SETTING: A multi-site healthcare system containing five hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Patients 18 years of age or older, admitted to the ED with VOC due to SCD, and received INF or IV morphine as an initial opioid upon presentation to the ED. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was to evaluate the percent change in pain reduction after the initial dose of opiate between groups. Secondary outcomes include time to first rescue medication, total morphine milligram equivalent (MME) of IV opiates, hypotension, bradycardia, respiratory distress requiring opiate reversal within 6 h post- study drug administration, readmission within 48 h, and ED disposition. RESULTS: A total of 230 patients were reviewed within the study period, 95 subjects met inclusion criteria, 31 subjects were included in the INF arm and 64 subjects in the IV morphine arm. The primary outcome showed an average percent pain reduction of 17.25% in the INF arm and 17.15% in the IV morphine arm. The point estimate difference was 0.1% (95% CI -9.3%-9.5%; non-inferiority (p < 0.0001). The median dose of IV opiates was 8 MME in the INF group, and 6 MME in the IV morphine group (p = 0.0268). The time from study drug to first rescue medication administration was 22.4 min and 27.3 min in the INF and IV morphine groups, respectively (p = 0.2231). There was no incidence of hypotension or respiratory distress requiring opiate reversal in either arm. Bradycardia occurred in 12.9% and 7.7% (p = 0.2042), readmission rates within 48 h due to VOC was 6.5% and 20.9% (p = 0.0553), and discharge from the ED to home was 16% and 66% (p = 0.0196) in INF and IV morphine arms, respectively. CONCLUSION: INF provided similar pain reduction compared to IV morphine in the treatment of adults with VOC presenting to the ED. IV morphine arm showed a statistically significant difference in discharge to home from the ED, however there was a trend in readmission within 48 h. The study showed no significant difference in hypotension, respiratory distress, or bradycardia between the groups. The INF group had no significant impact on time to drug administration compared to IV morphine, however it was within 1 h of patient presentation which complies with American Society of Hematology (ASH) guidelines. In conclusion, our study showed that INF was non-inferior when compared to IV morphine in reducing pain scores after drug administration. Therefore, INF is an effective alternative to IV morphine for pain management in adults presenting to the ED for VOC particularly in those with limited IV access.
37929626	Safety of Ultrasound Contrast Agents in Pediatric Patients With Sickle Cell Disease and Trait.	Ultrasound contrast agent (UCA) use is increasing. Recent isolated reports observed a rise in pain-related adverse events with the intravenous administration of the UCA Definity in adults with sickle cell disease. To date, no studies have investigated the incidence of similar adverse events with UCA Lumason or Optison. We describe our experience regarding the safety of Lumason and Optison in children with sickle cell disease and trait who underwent contrast-enhanced ultrasound exams in our department with intravenous, intravesical, and other intracavitary routes. No pain-related or other adverse events were observed in this pediatric population with any route of UCA administration.
33431265	Liver transplantation for sickle cell disease: a systematic review.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease is a group of autosomal recessive disorders characterised by haemolytic anaemia. Liver is one of the most affected organs, ranging from liver tests alterations to acute liver failure for which liver transplantation is the only life-saving treatment. METHODS: This study aims to make a systematic review of the current literature to evaluate indications, timing, and results of liver transplantation for patients affected by SCD. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients in total were reported worldwide until 2018, the average patient age is 28.7 (0.42-56), all patients have a pre-transplant diagnosis of SCD. Cirrhosis at transplantation was present in six-teen (n = 16, 55.1%) patients. In ten patients (n = 10, 34.5%), acute liver failure arises from healthy liver and presented sickle cell intrahepatic cholestasis. Eleven patients (n = 11, 39.2%) died, three (n = 3, 10.7%) in the first postoperative month, and seven (n = 7, 25%) in the first year. Mean follow-up was 27 months (range: 7-96), one-year overall survival was 48.7%. DISCUSSION: Liver transplantation for SCD has been increasingly reported with encouraging results. Indications are presently reserved for acute liver failure arising both in healthy liver and end-stage liver disease.
34489185	Complete neurological recovery from fat embolism syndrome in sickle cell disease after sequential red cell exchange transfusion and therapeutic plasma exchange.	Fat embolism syndrome in sickle cell disease is associated with great mortality, while more than half of survivors suffer severe neurological sequelae. Release of fat droplets leads to obstruction of the microcirculation as well as generation of proinflammatory cytokines that can cause direct tissue injury. Red cell exchange transfusion can be life-saving but the addition of therapeutic plasma exchange may further improve outcomes by removing such inflammatory mediators. Here, we describe the case of a 27-year-old male patient with sickle cell anaemia presenting with typical features of fat embolism syndrome including neurological involvement with greatly reduced level of consciousness. MRI of his brain showed multiple widespread microhemorrhages giving the characteristic "star field" pattern but also a cytotoxic lesion of the corpus callosum, known to be the result of direct neurotoxicity by proinflammatory cytokines. The patient underwent emergency red cell exchange transfusion leading only to modest clinical improvement but fully regained consciousness after three cycles of therapeutic plasma exchange. This case highlights the deleterious effect of the hyperinflammatory state characteristic of many sickle cell complications and supports further exploring the potential benefit from plasma exchange as an adjunct to red cell exchange in order to remove proinflammatory cytokines during acute complications of sickle cell disease.
37694765	Mixed donor chimerism following stem cell transplantation for sickle cell disease.	Sickle cell disease is a debilitating hemoglobinopathy with high morbidity and mortality. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) is curative, but the presence of mixed donor/recipient chimerism post-HCT raises concerns about disease control long-term. Mixed donor/recipient chimerism is reported in significant numbers even after aggressive HCT conditioning regimens. Post-HCT, adequacy of donor erythropoiesis is crucial for disease control. This review explores the relationship between mixed donor/recipient chimerism and outcomes post-HCT. Serial chimerism analysis in lineage specific manner in erythroid or myeloid cells post-HCT predicts for disease control and HCT success. Adequate and stable donor-derived erythropoiesis is essential for reversing SCD manifestations. Myeloid lineage chimerism mirrors erythropoiesis is commercially available, and a reliable indicator of adequacy. Using this tool, the minimum threshold of donor chimerism is required to prevent SCD-related complications and maintain sickle hemoglobin less than 50% is approximately 20-25% even when a donor has Hb S trait. Curative interventions should, at a minimum, meet this goal long-term. Achieving a balance between successful engraftment while minimizing toxicity is important in patients vulnerable because of age or preexisting morbidity and is the objective of recent clinical trials. As HCT and gene therapies evolve, efficient long-term follow-up that includes durability assessment of mixed donor/recipient chimerism will be crucial.
34332804	Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant for sickle cell disease: The why, who, and what.	Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants (allo-HSCTs) from matched-related donors (MRDs), mismatched-related donors (MMRDs), and matched-unrelated donors (MUDs) are increasingly being used to treat sickle cell disease (SCD) in both pediatric and adult patients. The overall results have been extremely encouraging, especially if a MRD is available and the transplant being performed before the age of 13. Although there is a general consensus that patients with high-risk SCD, even in adults and irrespective of donor characteristics, should be offered allo-HSCT, the debates on optimal patient selection and timing of transplant have yet to be resolved. Unlike patients with hematologic malignancies, there are also a number of clinical issues that require to be addressed in patients with SCD undergoing allo-HSCT. In this review, we will discuss the reasons allo-HSCT should be offered more widely to patients with SCD, the challenges facing physicians in patient selection and timing of transplant, and the awareness of and solutions to prevent the complications that are unique or more common in SCD undergoing allo-HSCT.
36161320	Lovo-cel gene therapy for sickle cell disease: Treatment process evolution and outcomes in the initial groups of the HGB-206 study.	lovo-cel (bb1111; LentiGlobin for sickle cell disease [SCD]) gene therapy (GT) comprises autologous transplantation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells transduced with the BB305 lentiviral vector encoding a modified beta-globin gene (betaA-T87Q ) to produce anti-sickling hemoglobin (HbAT87Q ). The efficacy and safety of lovo-cel for SCD are being evaluated in the ongoing phase 1/2 HGB-206 study (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02140554). The treatment process evolved over time, using learnings from outcomes in the initial patients to optimize lovo-cel's benefit-risk profile. Following modest expression of HbAT87Q in the initial patients (Group A, n = 7), alterations were made to the treatment process for patients subsequently enrolled in Group B (n = 2, patients B1 and B2), including improvements to cell collection and lovo-cel manufacturing. After 6 months, median Group A peripheral blood vector copy number (>=0.08 c/dg) and HbAT87Q levels (>=0.46 g/dL) were inadequate for substantial clinical effect but stable and sustained over 5.5 years; both markedly improved in Group B (patient B1: >=0.53 c/dg and >=2.69 g/dL; patient B2: >=2.14 c/dg and >=6.40 g/dL, respectively) and generated improved biologic and clinical efficacy in Group B, including higher total hemoglobin and decreased hemolysis. The safety of the lovo-cel for SCD treatment regimen largely reflected the known side effects of HSPC collection, busulfan conditioning regimen, and underlying SCD; acute myeloid leukemia was observed in two patients in Group A and deemed unlikely related to insertional oncogenesis. Changes made during development of the lovo-cel treatment process were associated with improved outcomes and provide lessons for future SCD GT studies.
34120124	Letter to the Editor: Physicians' Opinions of COVID-19 Ambulatory Care Constraints: A Survey of Sickle Cell Clinicians.	
38485402	[The transition of adolescents with sickle cell disease: an interdisciplinary exchange].	With the rising incidence of sickle cell disease, this chronic pathology is becoming the most common genetic disease in France. Advances in care have led to a marked improvement in life expectancy. Caregivers in pediatric facilities are therefore increasingly confronted with the question of the transition to adulthood of the adolescents they have been following since birth. As nurses working in Robert-Debre's transfusion and curative medicine unit, in 2022, adolescents accounted for 57 % of sickle cell patients enrolled in our transfusion exchange program. Adolescence is a period of major change, and the repercussions of the disease are all the more pronounced. This raises the issue of transferring them to the adult sector.
35894560	High-Priced Sickle Cell Gene Therapies Threaten to Exacerbate US Health Disparities and Establish New Pricing Precedents for Molecular Medicine.	Gene therapies to treat sickle cell disease are in development and are expected to have high costs. The large eligible population size - by far, the largest for a gene therapy - poses daunting budget challenges and threatens to exacerbate health disparities for Black patients, who make up the vast majority of American sickle cell patients.
34917079	Early Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cells (eMDSCs) Are Associated With High Donor Myeloid Chimerism Following Haploidentical HSCT for Sickle Cell Disease.	Haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (haplo-HSCT) is a widely available curative option for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Our original non-myeloablative haplo-HSCT trial employing post-transplant (PT) cyclophosphamide had a low incidence of GVHD but had high rejection rates. Here, we aimed to evaluate immune reconstitution following haplo-HSCT and identify cytokines and cells associated with graft rejection/engraftment. 50 cytokines and 10 immune cell subsets were screened using multiplex-ELISA and flow cytometry, respectively, at baseline and PT-Days 30, 60, 100, and 180. We observed the most significant differences in cytokine levels between the engrafted and rejected groups at PT-Day 60, corresponding with clinical findings of secondary graft rejection. Of the 44 cytokines evaluated, plasma concentrations of 19 cytokines were different between the two groups at PT-Day 60. Factor analysis suggested two independent factors. The first factor (IL-17A, IL-10, IL-7, G-CSF, IL-2, MIP-1a, VEGF, and TGFb1 contributed significantly) was strongly associated with engraftment with OR = 2.7 (95%CI of 1.4 to 5.4), whereas the second factor (GROa and IL-18 contributed significantly) was not significantly associated with engraftment. Sufficient donor myeloid chimerism (DMC) is critical for the success of HSCT; here, we evaluated immune cells among high (H) DMC (DMC>=20%) and low (L) DMC (DMC<20%) groups along with engrafted and rejected groups. We found that early myeloid-derived suppressor cell (eMDSC) frequencies were elevated in engrafted patients and patients with HDMC at PT-Day 30 (P< 0.04 & P< 0.003, respectively). 9 of 20 patients were evaluated for the source of eMDSCs. The HDMC group had high mixed chimeric eMDSCs as compared to the LDMC group (P< 0.00001). We found a positive correlation between the frequencies of eMDSCs and Tregs at PT-Day 100 (r=0.72, P <0.0007); eMDSCs at BSL and Tregs at PT-Day 100 (r=0.63, P <0.004). Of 10 immune regulatory cells and 50 cytokines, we observed mixed chimeric eMDSCs and IL-17A, IL-10, IL-7, G-CSF, IL-2, MIP-1a, VEGF, TGFb1 as potential hits which could serve as prognostic markers in predicting allograft outcome towards engraftment following haploidentical HSCT employing post-transplant cyclophosphamide. The current findings need to be replicated and further explored in a larger cohort.
32134128	Preoperative transfusion versus no transfusion policy in sickle cell disease patients: a randomized trial.	BACKGROUND: Many children with sickle cell disease (SCD) indicated for adenotonsillectomy receive pre-operative transfusion therapy, either simple or exchange transfusion, in order to reduce surgical and sickle cell disease-related complications. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This is a prospective randomized controlled clinical trial aiming to compare between preoperative simple transfusion and no transfusion in pediatric patients with sickle SCD admitted in Sultan Qaboos University Hospital, Muscat, Oman for adenotonsillectomy during the period from January 2014 through June 2018. They were randomly assigned into two arms (simple transfusion and no transfusion). RESULTS: Postoperative SCD-related complications have been encountered in 6 out of 138 patients (4.3%). There was no statistically significant difference between the two studied groups as regards the development of surgical or SCD-related complications (p = 0.6 and 0.8 respectively). The length of postoperative hospital stay was comparable in the two groups. (p = 0.607). SCD-related complications occurred exclusively in cases with homozygous sickle anemia (4 out of 81 = 4.9%). CONCLUSION: Sickle cell disease patients with a hemoglobin level above 7.5 g/dL do not need PRBCs transfusion prior to adenotonsillectomy. This approach did not increase the risk of postoperative surgical or SCD-related complications.
35404888	Outpatient Pain Management in Children With Chronic Pancreatitis: A Scoping Systematic Review.	OBJECTIVES: Although pain management is central to pediatric chronic pancreatitis (CP) care, no evidence-based guidelines exist. In this scoping systematic review, we sought promising strategies for CP pain treatment in children. METHODS: We systematically reviewed literature on pain management in children and adults with CP, and 2 conditions with similar pain courses: juvenile idiopathic arthritis and sickle cell disease. RESULTS: Of 8997 studies identified, 287 met inclusion criteria. There are no published studies of analgesic medications, antioxidants, dietary modification, integrative medicine, or regional nerve blocks in children with CP. In adults with CP, studies of nonopioid analgesics, pancreatic enzymes, and dietary interventions have mixed results. Retrospective studies suggest that endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and surgical procedures, most durably total pancreatectomy with islet autotransplant, improve pain for children with CP. Follow-up was short relative to a child's life. Large studies in adults also suggest benefit from endoscopic therapy and surgery, but lack conclusive evidence about optimal procedure or timing. Studies on other painful pediatric chronic illnesses revealed little generalizable to children with CP. CONCLUSIONS: No therapy had sufficient high-quality studies to warrant untempered, evidence-based support for use in children with CP. Multicenter studies are needed to identify pain management "best practices."
35705370	Sickle cell disease in children: an update of the evidence in low- and middle-income settings.	Sickle cell disease (SCD), one of the most common monogenetic diseases in the world, is associated with multisystemic complications that begin in childhood. Most of the babies homozygous for the sickle haemoglobin gene are born in sub-Saharan Africa. Over the years, progress has been made with early diagnosis through newborn screening, penicillin prophylaxis, pneumococcal immunisation, transcranial Doppler (TCD) screening, hydroxyurea therapy and chronic blood transfusions with remarkably improved survival and quality of life of children with SCD. However, wide disparities in outcomes exist between high-income countries (HICs) where over 90% survive to adulthood, and low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) where less than half achieve that milestone. Even in HICs, racial inequities pose barriers to accessing specialised care and receiving treatment for acute pain episodes. Better understanding of SCD pathophysiology is being exploited to develop new disease-modifying drugs and gene therapy approaches to further improve outcomes. Bone marrow transplantation is established as a curative treatment for SCD, but it is largely unavailable in LMICs. To bridge the disparity and inequity gaps, innovative approaches are needed in LMICs. Validated and more affordable, easy-to-use point-of-care tests offer opportunities to link early diagnosis with immunisation programmes and healthcare encounters. Widespread use of hydroxyurea therapy-a relatively affordable and effective disease-modifying drug-in LMICs would help improve survival and quality of life. Integration of SCD treatment into primary care linked to district level/provincial hospitals that are supported with evidence-based guidelines will help extend needed interventions to many more patients living in LMICs.
33715942	Primary Immunization Series Coverage of Children With Sickle Cell Disease.	INTRODUCTION: Children with sickle cell disease are at increased risk of serious infections, many of which can be prevented by receipt of recommended immunizations. Study objectives were to (1) assess the primary immunization series coverage among children with sickle cell disease and (2) compare the coverage with that of those without sickle cell disease. METHODS: The Michigan Care Improvement Registry was used to obtain primary immunization series doses and sickle cell disease status for all eligible children in Michigan born in 2001-2016 (analysis was conducted in 2019). Completion of series and each individual vaccine were assessed for every child at ages 19 and 35 months. Proportions were stratified by sickle cell disease status and compared using chi-square tests. Logistic regression was used to model the odds of completing the series at each age, as predicted by sickle cell disease status and adjusting for the presence of Medicaid identification number. RESULTS: The proportion of children who completed the immunization series was higher for those with sickle cell disease than for those without sickle cell disease at 19 months (58.5% vs 48.0%) and 35 months (74.7% vs 59.6%) (both p<0.0001). The odds of completing the series were 1.4 times higher at 19 months (95% CI=1.2, 1.6) and 1.7 times higher at 35 months (95% CI=1.5, 2.0) for children with sickle cell disease than for those without, adjusting for the presence of Medicaid identification number. CONCLUSIONS: Although children with sickle cell disease had higher immunization rates than those without sickle cell disease, >40% of children with sickle cell disease did not receive all recommended immunizations by age 19 months. Immunization information systems should be utilized to improve routine immunization coverage of children with sickle cell disease.
33077498	Manipulation of Developmental Gamma-Globin Gene Expression: an Approach for Healing Hemoglobinopathies.	beta-Hemoglobinopathies are the most common monogenic disorders, and a century of research has provided us with a better understanding of the attributes of these diseases. Allogenic stem cell transplantation was the only potentially curative option available for these diseases until the discovery of gene therapy. The findings on the protective nature of fetal hemoglobin in sickle cell disease (SCD) and thalassemia patients carrying hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH) mutations has given us the best evidence that the cure for beta-hemoglobinopathies remains hidden in the hemoglobin locus. The detailed understanding of the developmental gene regulation of gamma-globin (gamma-globin) and the emergence of gene manipulation strategies offer us the opportunity for developing a gamma-globin gene-modified autologous stem cell transplantation therapy. In this review, we summarize different therapeutic strategies that reactivate fetal hemoglobin for the gene therapy of beta-hemoglobinopathies.
31937250	Malaria in patients with sickle cell anaemia: burden, risk factors and outcome at the Laquintinie hospital, Cameroon.	BACKGROUND: It is believed that the current prevalence of malaria in endemic areas reflects selection for the carrier form of sickle cell trait through a survival advantage. Malaria has been incriminated as a great cause of mortality in people with sickle cell disease (SCD). However, people with SCD, a high-risk group, do not benefit from free or subsisized malaria prevention and treatment in Cameroon unlike other vulnerable groups which may be due to insufficient evidence to guide policy makers. This study aimed at describing clinical and socio-demographic characteristics of patients with malaria, determining the prevalence of malaria in hospitalized children and in those with SCD and without, compare frequency of presentation of malaria related complications (using clinical and laboratory elements that define severe malaria) between children admitted for malaria with SCD and those without and finally, determing the risk factors for death in children admitted for malaria. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of admission records of children age 1 to 18 years with a confirmed malaria diagnosis admitted at the Laquintinie Hospital during January 2015 through December 2018. Clinical features, laboratory characteristics and outcome of malarial infections, stratified by SCD status were studied. Patients with HIV infection, malnutrition, renal failure and discharged against medical advice were excluded from the study. Data were analysed using Epi-info 7 software and analysis done. Chi square test, Odds ratios, CI and student's t test were used to determine association between variables. Statistical significance was set at p-value <=0.05. RESULTS: The prevalence of malaria was lower among children with SCD than it was among children without SCD (23.5% vs 44.9%). Similarly, among those with a positive microscopy, the mean parasite density was significantly lower among children with SCD than it was among children without SCD (22,875.6 vs 57,053.6 parasites/ mul with t-value - 3.2, p-value 0.002). The mean hemoglobin concentration was lower in SCD as compared to non SCD (5.7 g/l vs 7.4 g/l, t-value - 12.5, p-value < 0.001). Overall mortality in SCD was 3.4% and malaria was reponsible for 20.4% of these deaths as compared to the 35.4% in non SCD patients. Convulsion and impaired consciousness were significantly lower in SCD group (OR:0.1, CI: 0.1-0.3, p value < 0.01 and OR:0.1, CI:0.1-0.2, p-value < 0.001 respectively). Death was significantly higher in SCD patients with malaria as compared to SCD patients admitted for other pathologies (3.2% vs 1.5%., OR:2.2, CI:1-5, p-value 0.050). CONCLUSION: The SCD population has a lower mortality related to malaria compared to the non-SCD population. Meanwhile, within the SCD population, those admitted with malaria are twice more likely to die than those admitted for other pathologies. Jaundice, hepatomegaly and splenomegaly were common in SCD with malaria, however no risk factors for malaria severity or malaria related death was identified.
34121200	Antigen matching for transfusion support in Brazilian female patients with sickle cell disease to reduce RBC alloimmunization.	BACKGROUND: Red blood cell (RBC) alloimmunization is a complication of patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and it has a greater impact on pregnancy, leading to a risk of hemolytic disease of the newborn and reducing blood availability for pregnant women. This study proposed to evaluate antigen matching transfusion protocols, aiming to reduce RBC alloimmunization in Brazilian female patients with SCD. METHODS: Samples from female patients with SCD (153) and self-declared Afro-Brazilian donors (307) were genotyped for RBC antigens and RH variants were investigated. The transfusion needs of patients during 1-year period and the number of compatible donors were assessed using three antigen-matching transfusion protocols: prophylactic CEK antigen-matched RBCs, prophylactic extended antigen-matched RBCs, and extended-matched red blood cells (RBCs) only for alloimmunized patients. In addition, RH molecular matching has been proposed for patients carrying variant RHCE. RESULTS: Provision of CEK antigen-matched donors would have been possible in 92.4% of transfusion events while provision of prophylactic extended antigen-matched RBCs would cover 88.7% of the transfusion events. Extended antigen matching for alloimmunized patients would be efficient in 99% of the cases. The presence of partial D in 10 patients increased the need of D-negative donors. Compatible donors could be enough for four of the five patients with altered RHCE genotypes in both alleles. CONCLUSION: In Brazilians, screening African descent donors allows the implementation of prophylactic CEK and extended antigen-matching transfusion protocols to female patients with SCD to reduce RBC alloimmunization; however, the supply of compatible blood can be impaired for patients with Rh variants.
34850464	Sickle cell disease patients in two London trusts: Genotyping including RH variants.	BACKGROUND: All SCD patients need extended RBC antigen typing (by serology or genotyping) for provision of extended RH, K matched blood and to guide RBC selection in those with complex transfusion requirements. Genotyping can also identify RH variants which can cause sensitisation even when extended RH phenotypically matched blood is provided and alloantibodies associated with RH variants can cause HTRs. OBJECTIVES: To review the use of RBC genotyping in SCD patients at two London trusts (ICHNT, LNWH) with a focus on RH variants. METHODS: Retrospective review with data collected from clinical notes, local and national pathology reporting systems. RESULTS: A 311/482 (64%) ICHNT patients and 181/346 (52%) LNWH patients had extended genotyping. Of genotyped patients, 68 (22%) ICHNT and 31 (17%) LNWH patients had RH variants. Eight ICHNT patients had RH variants and corresponding antibodies associated with RH variants; 4/8 received multiple transfusions with antigen positive RBCs but had no evidence of haemolysis. One LNWH patient had a RH variant with corresponding alloantibody but could not be investigated further for possible HTR. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients (59%) had genotyping and a significant number had RH variants (99, 20%). A small proportion (9, 9%) had antibodies associated with RH variants, but with no evidence of clinically significant HTRs despite transfusions in four of them with antigen positive RBCs. All SCD patients should have RBC genotyping including RH variants (preferentially over extended phenotyping) to guide better selection of RBC units. However, where antigen negative blood cannot be provided, the risk of alloimmunisation is not inevitable and subsequent HTRs from antibodies associated with RH variants might not always occur.
31758587	How do I incorporate red cell genotyping to improve chronic transfusion therapy?	BACKGROUND: Children with transfusion dependent anemia, such as sickle cell disease (SCD) and thalassemia, are at an increased risk for developing red blood cell (RBC) alloantibodies due to their lifelong need for transfusion therapy. With the advent of genotyping, extended RBC antigen typing can be incorporated into chronic transfusion therapy programs (CTTPs) to improve patient care and provide antigen matched blood for this population of patients. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The hospital, blood center (BC), and hematology clinic caring for children requiring long-term transfusion support developed a CTTP. Genotyping was performed at entry to determine patient RBC antigen type. Limited versus extended antigen matching of transfusions was provided based on known RBC antibodies. RESULTS: Fifty patients with the following disorders were enrolled: 20 with SCD, 23 with thalassemia, and 7 with other disorders. At enrollment, nine (18%) had RBC alloantibodies, including six (30%) of patients with SCD and three (13%) with thalassemia. Two children developed antibodies after enrollment; one warm autoantibody following limited "CEK" matched RBCs and one patient with a hemizygous variant RHD allele developed anti-D. Six (30%) patients with SCD had variant RHCE alleles; two had homozygous variant alleles and four had a variant present along with a wild type allele. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate how a CTTP can be developed in a community hospital through collaboration with the blood supplier, hospital, and clinical care team. A model of incorporating RBC genotyping informs risk for alloimmunization and allows consideration of transfusion strategy for providing prophylactic antigen matched blood.
32032243	Liver Stiffness Measurement by Vibration Controlled Transient Elastography Does Not Correlate to Hepatic Iron Overload in Children With Sickle Cell Disease.	BACKGROUND: Children with sickle cell disease (SCD) are at risk of liver injury because of sickle cell hepatopathy and iron overload from chronic transfusions (CT). The authors examine the association between iron overload and liver stiffness measurement (LSM) by vibration controlled transient elastography (VCTE), which has been shown to correlate with fibrosis. METHODS: Patients 21 years of age and less with SCD had VCTE performed; those who received CT underwent magnetic resonance imaging T2* for iron quantification. RESULTS: The authors enrolled 42 patients, 17 (40%) of whom received CT. There was no difference in LSM between patients who underwent CT (5.5+-1.5 kPa) and those who did not (5.2+-2.3 kPa) (P=0.923). There was no correlation between iron quantification and LSM (r=-0.077, P=0.769). However, children 12 years of age and older had abnormal LSM when compared with a reference range (P=0.013). CONCLUSION: VCTE is a noninvasive technology that is feasible in children with SCD. LSM values were elevated in older children but did not correlate with iron overload, suggesting that fibrosis may not be affected by iron overload alone. Though additional data are needed, LSM may be a useful test for the progression of liver disease in SCD regardless of iron burden.
38161155	Management of Acute Sickle Cell Disease Pain.	Pain is a common complication of sickle cell disease. Sickle cell pain can often be effectively managed by pediatricians in outpatient and hospital settings. Acute pain management should be initiated quickly. Patients need to be evaluated for sickle cell complications and other causes of pain. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids are the mainstay of pain treatment, but additional therapies include hydration, local pain control, muscle relaxants, and nonpharmacologic approaches. Healthy lifestyle habits and good behavioral and mental health are important for preventing and coping with sickle cell disease pain. Disease-modifying therapies, such as hydroxyurea, can help prevent sickle hemoglobin polymerization and acute pain episodes. Because sickle cell disease largely affects people who are racialized minorities in the United States, health-care providers need to be aware of how their own personal biases may affect care of these patients.
35975375	Depression among patient with sickle cell disease: Prevalence and prediction.	Background: Depression is a widespread disorder with either an independent or interrelated relationship with chronic disease. Aim: This study aims to assess depression prevalence and its predictors among patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Patients and Methods: This is a cross-sectional study conducted in Saudi Arabia where patients with SCD assessed for having depression through Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9). Results: Depression was evaluated among 88 patients with SCD with a median age of 32.6 +- 11.8. Out of 88 patients, 44 (50%) participants had some form of depression. Out of those with depression, 25 (56.8%) had mild depression and 18 (40.9%) had moderate depression. However, there was a significant relationship between depression and the number of annual emergency visits, intensive care unit admissions, and frequency of blood transfusion (P-value < 0.05). There was no significant relationship between depression with neither hemoglobin nor HbS (P-value > 0.05). However, depression score found to be inversely proportional to the HbF level. Both gender and annual emergency visits were significantly related to depression (P-value = 0.01, 0.001. respectively). Conclusion: Depression is quite prevalent in patients with SCD though it is still being overlooked. Several clinical and laboratory indices found to be closely linked to depression. Constellations of these factors may help early recognition of depression and disease severity modulation.
32949495	In Vivo HSC Gene Therapy Using a Bi-modular HDAd5/35++ Vector Cures Sickle Cell Disease in a Mouse Model.	We have recently reported that, after in vivo hematopoietic stem cell/progenitor (HSPC) transduction with HDAd5/35++ vectors, SB100x transposase-mediated gamma-globin gene addition achieved 10%-15% gamma-globin of adult mouse globin, resulting in significant but incomplete phenotypic correction in a thalassemia intermedia mouse model. Furthermore, genome editing of a gamma-globin repressor binding site within the gamma-globin promoter by CRISPR-Cas9 results in efficient reactivation of endogenous gamma-globin. Here, we aimed to combine these two mechanisms to obtain curative levels of gamma-globin after in vivo HSPC transduction. We generated a HDAd5/35++ adenovirus vector (HDAd-combo) containing both modules and tested it in vitro and after in vivo HSPC transduction in healthy CD46/beta-YAC mice and in a sickle cell disease mouse model (CD46/Townes). Compared to HDAd vectors containing either the gamma-globin addition or the CRISPR-Cas9 reactivation units alone, in vivo HSC transduction of CD46/Townes mice with the HDAd-combo resulted in significantly higher gamma-globin in red blood cells, reaching 30% of that of adult human alpha and betaS chains and a complete phenotypic correction of sickle cell disease.
35131182	Therapeutic plasma exchange in the management of acute complications of sickle cell disease: A single centre experience.	Sickle cell disease results in systemic inflammation even at steady state and this is accentuated during acute crises. The plasma of affected patients contains several proinflammatory cytokines as well as adhesion molecules and prothrombotic factors. This environment promotes further red cell sickling while many of these substances can cause direct tissue toxicity and end-organ damage. Even though red cell transfusion, whether simple or exchange, is the mainstay of treatment of severe acute complications, addition of therapeutic plasma exchange could potentially provide additional benefit by removing such harmful substances. Here, we describe two cases where therapeutic plasma exchange was used. The first involved a patient with the acute chest syndrome who despite adequate red cell exchange remained significantly hypoxic and in severe pain. We therefore proceeded to perform plasma exchange; this led to rapid clinical improvement and resolution of his symptoms. The second case involved a patient with intractable chest wall pain and impending acute chest syndrome; this patient also had a past history of hyperhaemolysis. The patient underwent therapeutic plasma exchange with very rapid resolution of the pain, avoidance of any respiratory deterioration and full recovery. We also give a brief summary of our previous experience using plasma exchange in patients with sickle cell disease. Plasma exchange was well tolerated with no adverse events in all cases we have treated, led to rapid resolution of pain irrespective of primary indication and in the majority of cases to a favourable clinical outcome.
38578371	Partial Splenic Embolization in Paediatric Sickle Cell Disease Patients with Hypersplenism.	PURPOSE: To assess the safety and efficacy of partial splenic embolization (PSE) to reduce the need of transfusions and improve hematologic parameters in patients with hypersplenism and sickle cell disease (SCD). MATERIAL AND METHODS: This prospective study includes 35 homozygous hemoglobin S patients with SCD and hypersplenism who underwent PSE from 2015 until 2021 in Kinshasa. Patients were evaluated, before and after PSE (1, 3 and 6 months), using clinical, laboratory and ultrasonographic methods. PSE was performed with the administration of gelatin sponge particles embolizing 60-70% of the splenic parenchyma. RESULTS: The mean age was 10 (+- 4) years and (21/35, 60%) were male. After PSE Leucocytes decreased at 3 months (16 692.94 vs 13 582.86, p = 0.02) and at six months Erythrocytes increased 2 004 000 vs. 2 804 142 (p < 0.001), Platelets increased (168 147 vs. 308 445, p < 0.001) and Hemoglobin increased (5.05 g/dL vs. 6.31 g/dL, p < 0.001) There was a significant dicrease in the need of transfusions from 6 (2-20) before PSE to 0.06 (0-1) after PSE (p < 0.001). The most frequent complication was splenic rupture (4/35, 11.4%), seen only and in all patients with hypoechogenic nodules at baseline. CONCLUSION: PSE is a safe procedure in patients with SCD and hypersplenism, that do not have hypoechogenic nodules in the spleen. PSE improves the hematological parameters and reduces the frequency of blood transfusions.
32639228	Coronavirus Disease among Persons with Sickle Cell Disease, United States, March 20-May 21, 2020.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) disproportionately affects Black or African American persons in the United States and can cause multisystem organ damage and reduced lifespan. Among 178 persons with SCD in the United States who were reported to an SCD-coronavirus disease case registry, 122 (69%) were hospitalized and 13 (7%) died.
35998894	Eclampsia a preventable tragedy: an African overview.	Eclampsia is a multisystemic disease associated with various complications which individually or in combination can lead to maternal/fetal morbidity and mortality. Developed countries and some developing countries were largely successful in reducing the incidence of eclampsia. Developing countries especially those in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are still dealing with high incidence of eclampsia. The question is why have the incidence and mortality of eclampsia remained high in SSA? The risk factors for this disease are globally the same but a critical assessment showed that there are certain risk factors that are common in Sub-Saharan Africa (multiple pregnancy, sickle cell disease, pregnancies at the extremes of reproductive age, pre-existing vasculitis). In addition, there are compounding factors (illiteracy, poverty, superstitious beliefs, poor prenatal care services, poorly trained manpower and lack of facilities to cater for patients). Addressing the menace of this disease require a holistic approach which among others, includes education to address beliefs and reduce harmful practices, poverty alleviation which will improve the ability for communities to afford health care services. Improving transport services to convey patients quickly to facilities on time when there is need. Improving the health infrastructure, building more facilities, providing trained and motivated manpower and regular supply of quality essential drugs for the management of the disease. This review is meant to analyze factors prevalent in Sub-Saharan that hinder reducing incidence of the disease and provide comprehensive and cost-effective solutions.
32614805	Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia in a Sickle Cell Trait Patient: A Report of a Rare Case with Use of Nuclear Medicine, and a Literature Review.	BACKGROUND Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), also known as Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome, is a rare autosomal dominant disease. CASE REPORT Here, we report a case of a 49-year-old Brazilian woman with a history of multiple hospitalizations, sometimes life-threatening anemia, and uncommon clinical manifestations. CONCLUSIONS We provide a brief literature review regarding the most common signs and symptoms, history, diagnosis, and treatment. Special attention is given to the techniques for identifying hemorrhagic areas, to the presence of angiodysplasia in gastric tissue, and the identification of sickle cell trait, this being an unprecedented hematological condition in the presentation of the disease. Thus, further studies on the relationship between sickle cell trait and the syndrome are needed.
38205646	Management of a patient with sickle cell disease and multiple red blood cell alloantibodies in preparation for a hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.	BACKGROUND: Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is currently the only widely available curative option for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Alloimmunization in this population is frequent and can complicate transfusion management during the HSCT period. The case of a pediatric patient with severe SCD clinical phenotype, multiple alloantibodies (9), and hyperhemolysis syndrome who underwent haploidentical HSCT is described. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The patient was known for an anti-e, despite RHCE*01.01 allele, which predicts a C- c+ E- weak e+ phenotype. Donors matching the patient's extended phenotype were targeted for RHCE genotyping. RESULTS: Donors homozygotes or heterozygotes for RHCE*01.01 were selected for compatibility analyses and ranked based on strength of reactions. Discordance between zygosity and strength of reactions was observed, as the most compatible donors were heterozygotes for RHCE*01.01. In total, the patient received seven RBC units from two different donors during HSCT process without transfusion reaction or development of new alloantibodies. Six months post-HSCT, his hemoglobin level is stable at around 120 g/L and his chimerism is 100%. DISCUSSION: This case highlights the complexity of transfusion management during HSCT of alloimmunized patients with SCD. Collecting sufficient compatible units requires early involvement of transfusion medicine teams and close communication with the local blood provider. Genotyping of donors self-identifying as Black is useful for identifying compatible blood for those patients but has some limitations. HSCT for heavily alloimmunized patients is feasible and safe with early involvement of transfusion medicine specialists. Further research on the clinical impact of genotypic matching is needed.
37317564	Plasma exchange-A useful adjunct therapy to red cell exchange in patients with sickle cell disease and multiorgan dysfunction.	BACKGROUND: Urgent red cell exchange (RBCx) is indicated for many complications of sickle cell disease (SCD), including acute chest syndrome, stroke, and hepatic/splenic sequestration. Many who receive RBCx remain hospitalized and develop further complications, including multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), a leading cause of death in intensive care units. Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) has been advocated as an effective treatment of MODS, but its role in SCD compared with RBCx alone is not well studied. METHODS: We identified all ICU encounters from 2013 to 2019 involving RBCx procedures for MODS or SCD crisis that progressed to MODS, a total of 12 encounters. Data regarding hospital length of stay (LOS), survival, number of TPE procedures following RBCx, and procedure characteristics were collected. Surrogate laboratory markers of end-organ damage and disease severity scores were recorded at the time of admission, post-RBCx, post-TPE, and at discharge. RESULTS: Eight encounters involved RBCx followed by TPE (TPE group) while four involved RBCx alone (RBCx group). The TPE group had a higher SOFA score at ICU admission (9.5 vs. 7.0), greater predicted mortality, and a statistical trend toward higher disease severity scores following RBCx relative to the RBCx group (p = 0.10). The TPE group showed a significantly greater decrease in SOFA score between RBCx and discharge (p = 0.04). No significant difference in mortality or hospital LOS was observed between the groups. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest TPE may be considered as an adjunct treatment for patients with acute complications of SCD that progress to MODS, especially in cases where there is no significant improvement following RBCx.
38263886	Reversal of Cerebral Arteriopathy Post-Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant for Sickle Cell Disease.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a chronic hematologic disorder which causes progressive cerebral arteriopathy beginning in childhood. As a result, arterial ischemic stroke is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in SCD, and SCD is a leading cause of childhood stroke worldwide. Allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) may be curative for individuals with SCD. Long-term outcomes and effects are currently being studied. In this report, we describe a child with SCD who presented with arterial ischemic stroke at 6 years of age and was found to have a severe form of cerebral large vessel arteriopathy by catheter-directed angiography. The patient initially underwent revascularization surgery by indirect superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery bypass, and 1 year later, he underwent curative HSCT. Approximately 3 years after HSCT, repeat catheter-directed angiography revealed a striking reversal of cerebral large vessel arteriopathy. This article reveals a previously unrecognized and potentially beneficial effect of HSCT that may ameliorate cerebral large vessel arteriopathy and improve cerebrovascular health for children with SCD.
34254882	A Comparison of Two Regimens for Managing Sickle Cell Pain and Reducing Readmissions.	This was a multicenter retrospective analysis comparing intravenous push (IVP) analgesia versus patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) in patients admitted for sickle cell pain crisis. The primary objective was to compare the analgesic management, measured in total daily morphine milligram equivalents (MME). Secondary objectives included length of hospitalization, 30-day hospital readmissions and pain scores. Of the 98 patients identified between August 2017 and August 2018, 68 patients were included in this study. There were 51% (n = 35) in the IVP group and 49% (n = 33) in the PCA group. The majority of patients were on 90 or more daily MME prior to admission. The average total daily MME was significantly higher in patients on PCA compared to IVP on the first three days of hospitalization (289 vs 146, p < 0.01). Length of hospitalization was not different between patients on IVP and PCA (7.14 vs. 6.39 days, p = 0.53). There was no difference in 30-day readmissions, average pain scores on days 1-3 of hospitalization and adverse side effects between the groups. This study showed patients on IVP had significantly lower total daily MME requirements compared to PCA within the first three calendar days of admission.
35452362	The spectrum and burden of in-patient paediatric musculoskeletal diseases in Northern Tanzania.	BACKGROUND: Musculoskeletal diseases (MSD) are a major contributor to the global burden of disease and disability, and disproportionally affect low- and middle-income countries; however, there is a dearth of epidemiological data. Affected children often face increased morbidity, social isolation and economic hardship. AIM: To assess the spectrum and burden of paediatric MSD in children aged 5-18 years admitted to a major referral hospital in Tanzania. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of children aged 5-18 years admitted to Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre (KCMC) whose initial diagnosis was recognised as a musculoskeletal condition by the International Classification of Diseases-10 between 1 January and 31 December 2017. RESULTS: During 2017, 163 cases of confirmed paediatric MSD were admitted to KCMC, representing 21.2% of all admissions of children aged 5-18 years (n = 769). Bone disease was the most common diagnosis. They comprised 106 (65.0%) traumatic fractures, 31 (19.0%) osteo-articular infections, 9 (5.5%) malunions and 3 (1.8%) pathological fractures. Congenital defects and rheumatic disease were relatively uncommon, accounting for only 6 (3.7%) and 4 (2.5%) MSD admissions, respectively. CONCLUSION: The majority of cases of MSD were related to fractures, followed by osteo-articular infections, while recognised cases of rheumatic disease were rare. The study, although small, identified the sizeable burden and spectrum of paediatric MSD admitted to a hospital in Tanzania over a 12-month period and highlights the need for larger studies to inform the optimal allocation of health resources.

33119448	The association between hydroxyurea adherence and opioid utilization among Texas Medicaid enrollees with sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD) suffer from recurrent catastrophic pain crises that are often managed by opioid analgesics. Being adherent to hydroxyurea has been associated with decreased health care resource use for pain; however, evidence of its association with opioid use is limited. OBJECTIVE: To determine if adherence to hydroxyurea is associated with opioid use among patients with SCD. METHODS: This retrospective study used Texas Medicaid data from September 1, 2011, to August 31, 2016 (study period). The index date was the date of hydroxyurea initiation. Patients who were aged 2-63 years at the index date, had >= 1 inpatient or >= 2 outpatient SCD diagnoses during the study period, had >= 1 hydroxyurea prescription during the identification period (September 1, 2011-August 31, 2015), had no diagnosis of other indications for hydroxyurea during the study period, and were continuously enrolled for at least 12 months after the index date were included. Hydroxyurea adherence was measured using medication possession ratio (MPR). The study outcomes (measured 1-year post-index) were (a) opioid use; (b) number of opioid prescriptions; (c) strong opioid use (morphine, hydromorphone, fentanyl, and methadone); (d) number of strong opioid prescriptions; (e) high-dose opioid use (>= 50 mg morphine milligram equivalent [MME]); and (f) days supply for opioid prescriptions. Covariates included demographic (age and gender) and clinical (vaso-occlusive crisis [VOC], avascular necrosis, iron overload, acute chest syndrome, and blood transfusion) characteristics. Descriptive, bivariate (chi-square and Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests), multiple logistic regression, and negative binomial regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: 1,146 patients (18.3 [12.3] years) met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 19.6% were adherent to hydroxyurea (defined as MPR >= 80%) and mean (SD) MPR was 48.3% (29.7%). In the 1 year following hydroxyurea initiation, 923 (80.5%) patients had >= 1 opioid prescription with 7.6 (9.4) opioid prescriptions per patient, while 259 (22.6%) patients had >= 1 strong opioid prescription with 1.5 (4.4) strong opioid prescriptions per patient. Average (SD) opioid dose was 41.7 (74.3) mg MME, and 27.1% had high daily MME doses (>= 50 mg MME). Average (SD) opioid days supply was 83.1 (112.2) days. After adjusting for covariates, compared with being nonadherent, being adherent to hydroxyurea was associated with a 50.5% decreased risk of having strong opioids (OR = 0.495, 95% CI = 0.278-0.879, P = 0.0165). Additionally, SCD-related complications (VOC, avascular necrosis, and iron overload) and older age were significant factors associated with opioid use and higher MME. Post hoc analyses showed that being adherent to hydroxyurea was significantly associated with lower probabilities of experiencing SCD-related complications. CONCLUSIONS: Results showed that patients with SCD are moderately adherent to hydroxyurea. Being adherent to hydroxyurea was found to be associated with a lower risk of receiving a prescription for strong opioids. Findings suggest that close monitoring and interventions to improve adherence may help mitigate strong opioid use among these patients. DISCLOSURES: This research did not receive any specific funding. Barner and Kang report grants from Novartis Pharmaceuticals, unrelated to this work. A part of this study was presented as a poster at the American Pharmacists Association (APhA) 2019 Annual Meeting and Exposition (March 22-25, 2019, Seattle, WA) and received the 2019 APhA-APRS Presentation Award in the APhA-APRS Contributed Research Paper, Graduate Student/Fellow/Postdoctoral Scholar category.
31742431	Perspectives of Sickle Cell Disease Stakeholders on Heritable Genome Editing.	Advances in CRISPR technology and the announcement of the first gene-edited babies have sparked a global dialogue about the future of heritable genome editing (HGE). There has been an international call for public input to inform a substantive debate about benefits and risks of HGE. This study investigates the views of the sickle cell disease (SCD) community. We utilized a mixed-methods approach to examine SCD stakeholders' views in the United States. We found SCD stakeholders hold a nuanced view of HGE. Assuming the technology is shown to be safe and effective, they are just as supportive of HGE as genetics professionals, but more supportive than the general public. However, they are also concerned about the potential implications of HGE, despite this support. As discourse surrounding HGE advances, it is crucial to engage disease communities and other key stakeholders whose lives could be altered by these interventions.
33098344	Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from sibling and unrelated donors in pediatric patients with sickle cell disease-A single center experience.	HSCT is curative in SCD. Patients with HLA-identical sibling donor have an excellent outcome ranging from 90%-100% overall and event-free survival. However, due to the lack of matched sibling donors this option is out of reach for 70% of patients with SCD. The pool of potential donors needs to be extended. Transplantations from HLA-matched unrelated donors were reported to be less successful with shorter event-free survival and higher incidences of complications including graft-vs-host disease, especially in patients with advanced stage SCD. Here we report transplantation outcomes for 25 children with SCD transplanted using HLA-matched grafts from related or unrelated donors. Overall survival was 100% with no severe (grade III-IV) graft-vs-host disease and a 12% rejection rate. Mixed donor chimerisms only occurred in transplantations from siblings, while transplantations from unrelated donors resulted in either complete donor chimerism or rejection. Despite the small patient number, overall and disease-free survival for unrelated donor transplantations is excellent in this cohort. The advanced disease state, higher alloreactive effect and stronger immunosuppression in unrelated donor transplantations raises patient risk, for which possible solutions could be found in optimization of transplant preparation, graft manipulation or haploidentical transplantation using T cell receptor alpha/beta-depleted grafts.
36356169	Assessment of transition readiness to predict health care utilization during transition to adult care in sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Transition-age patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) are at risk for poor outcomes associated with incomplete transition readiness and neurocognitive deficits. Study objectives were to: 1) test if a SCD-specific measure of self-management skills was associated with transition outcomes and 2) evaluate if caregiver-reported executive functioning was associated with self-management skills and transition outcomes among youth with SCD. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Youth/caregivers were selected from a longitudinal cohort study. Caregivers completed the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF); caregivers and youth completed the Self-Management Skills Checklist (SMSC) at a median age of 16.8 +- 0.6 years. Non-parametric tests compared SMSC and transition outcomes. Regression assessed the incremental validity of SMSC in predicting transition outcomes. RESULTS: In total, 95 participants (54% male, 55% severe genotype) completed the SMSC assessment. Most participants (87%) transferred to adult care within six months and 87% were retained for at least 12 months. BRIEF and caregiver-reported SMSC assessments were weakly, negatively correlated (rho = -0.25, p = 0.0392) but were not significant in predicting transition outcomes (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The SMSC and executive function did not predict adult care engagement. Development of readiness assessments that predict care engagement and reflect self-efficacy is important for monitoring transition-aged patients with SCD.
37953236	"The project did not come to us with a solution": Perspectives of research teams on implementing a study about electronic health record-embedded individualized pain plans for emergency department treatment of vaso-occlusive episodes in adults with sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: This study aimed to capture the implementation process of the ALIGN Study, (An individualized Pain Plan with Patient and Provider Access for Emergency Department care of Sickle Cell Disease). ALIGN aimed to embed Individualized Pain Plans in the electronic health record (E-IPP) and provide access to the plan for both adult patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and emergency department providers when a person with SCD comes to the emergency department in vaso-occlusive crises. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with research teams from the 8 participating sites from the ALIGN study. Seventeen participants (principal investigators and study coordinators) shared their perspectives about the implementation of ALIGN in their sites. Data were analyzed in three phases using open coding steps adapted from grounded theory and qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: A total of seven overarching themes were identified: (1) the E-IPP structure (location and upkeep) and collaboration with the informatics team, (2) the role of ED champion, (3) the role of research coordinators, (4) research team communication, and communication between research team and clinical team, (5) challenges with the study protocol, (6) provider feedback: addressing over-utilizers, patient mistrust, and the positive feedback about the intervention, and (7) COVID-19 and its effects on study implementation. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study contribute to learning how to implement E-IPPs for adult patients with SCD in ED. The study findings highlight the importance of early engagement with different team members, a champion from the emergency department, study coordinators with different skills and enhancement of communication and trust among team members. Further recommendations are outlined for hospitals aiming to implement E-IPP for patients with SCD in ED.
32367470	[Pain management in sickle cell disease].	Sickle cell disease is associated with numerous symptoms and complications. Acute painful crisis is the most characteristic manifestation of the disease. In addition, many patients report chronic pain. As both acute and chronic pain severely diminish quality of life, adequate pain management is crucial. Recommendations for the treatment of acute painful crises are based on the World Health Organization analgesic ladder, which has been developed for cancer-related pain. Chronic pain can be treated with basic long-acting opioids and on-demand short-acting opioids. If patients show signs of neuropathic pain, administration of anticonvulsants, antidepressants or possibly ketamine should be considered.
32202242	Proceeding of the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) congress on sickle cell disease, 16-17 may 2019, Regensburg, Germany: What is the impact of antithymocyte globulin pharmacokinetics on haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation?	Antithymocyte globulin (ATG) is a widely accepted part of the conditioning regimen applied in the setting of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) to prevent graft rejection and graft-versus-host disease. Although weight-based dosing of ATG has been introduced to optimize ATG dosing, substantial variance in clearance of active ATG, the actual lymphocyte binding component, remains a challenge. Therefore, further research regarding ATG pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in different HSCT settings and in patients with different types of underlying diseases is required.

38050205	Nosocomial infections in sickle cell anemia patients: Prevention through multi-disciplinary approach: A review.	Sickle cell anemia (SCA), a hereditary blood disorder characterized by the presence of abnormal hemoglobin, poses a unique set of challenges for both patients and healthcare providers. One of the most pressing issues in the care of these individuals is the persistent threat of nosocomial infections, which are infections acquired during hospitalization. This abstract provides a concise overview of the ongoing challenge of nosocomial infections in SCA patients, highlighting the factors contributing to their vulnerability and the preventive measures in place. SCA patients face increased susceptibility to nosocomial infections due to their compromised immune systems, frequent hospitalizations, prolonged stays, and the need for invasive medical interventions. The emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens further complicates the management of these infections. To address this challenge, healthcare facilities have implemented infection control protocols, vaccination strategies, and antimicrobial stewardship, emphasizing the importance of patient education. Recognizing the gravity of this issue and adopting comprehensive preventive measures is crucial to improving the quality of care and patient outcomes in this vulnerable population. Further research and ongoing efforts are essential to reducing the burden of nosocomial infections in SCA patients and enhancing their overall healthcare experience.
34803155	Navigating Ethical Challenges for Pediatric Sickle Cell Pain Management in the Context of the Opioid Epidemic.	OBJECTIVES: The aim was to describe the impact of the opioid epidemic on pain management practices in pediatric sickle cell disease (SCD) and propose a conceptual framework for navigating ethical decision-making in pediatric sickle cell pain management. METHODS: A review of the literature on ethical challenges in the management of sickle cell pain was conducted and considered in the context of the opioid epidemic and psychosocial factors affecting youth with SCD. The Integrated Ethical Framework for Pain Management (IEFPM) was applied to pediatric sickle cell pain management using a clinical case example. RESULTS: Implicit bias, health-related stigma, and potential neurocognitive impairment all present unique challenges in ethical decision-making for youth with SCD. National guidelines for prescribing opioid medication may complicate providers' clinical decision-making and affect their sickle cell pain management practices. The IEFPM was found to be applicable to ethical decision-making for pediatric sickle cell pain and captures both patient-related and provider-related aspects of clinical pain management. DISCUSSION: The opioid epidemic has exacerbated existing ethical challenges for pain management among youth with SCD. The IEFPM provides a conceptual model that can be integrated into health care settings to facilitate ethical decision-making and promote greater health equity in the clinical management of pediatric sickle cell pain.
37933708	Impact of a hospital service for adults with chronic childhood-onset disease: A propensity weighted analysis.	BACKGROUND: Young adults with chronic childhood-onset diseases (CCOD) transitioning care from pediatrics to adult care are at high risk for readmission after hospital discharge. At our institution, we have implemented an inpatient service, the Med-Peds (MP) line, to improve transitions to adult care and reduce hospital utilization by young adults with CCOD. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the effect of the MP line on length of stay (LOS) and 30-day readmission rates compared to other inpatient services. METHODS: This was an observational, retrospective cohort analysis of patients admitted to the MP line compared to other hospital service lines over a 2-year period. To avoid potential confounding by indication for admission to the MP line, propensity score weighting methods were used. RESULTS: The MP line cared for 302 patients with CCOD from June 2019 to July 2021. Compared to other service lines, there was a 33% reduction in relative risk of 30-day readmission (26.9% compared to 40.3%, risk ratio = 0.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.55-0.81). LOS was 10% longer for the MP line (event time ratio (ETR): 1.10 95% CI 1.0-1.21) with median LOS 4.8 versus 4.5 days. Patients with sickle cell disease had less of a reduction in 30-day readmissions and longer LOS. CONCLUSION: Hospitalization for young adults with CCOD on a MP service line was associated with lower 30-day readmission rates and longer LOS than hospitalization on other services. Further research is needed to assess which components of the line most contribute to decreased utilization.
34483044	Challenging the dogma of the healthy heterozygote: Implications for newborn screening policies and practices.	Heterozygous (carrier) status for an autosomal recessive condition is traditionally considered to lack significance for an individual's health, but this assumption has been challenged by a growing body of evidence. Carriers of several autosomal recessive disorders and some X-linked diseases are potentially at risk for the pathology manifest in homozygotes. This minireview provides an overview of the literature regarding health risks to carriers of two common autosomal recessive conditions on the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel: sickle cell disease [sickle cell trait (SCT)] and cystic fibrosis (CF). We also consider and comment on bioethical and policy implications for newborn blood screening (NBS). Health risks for heterozygotes, while relatively low for individuals, are often influenced by intrinsic (e.g., other genomic variants or co-morbidities) and extrinsic (environmental) factors, which present opportunities for personalized genomic medicine and risk counseling. They create a special challenge, however, for developing screening/follow-up policies and for genetic counseling, particularly after identification and reporting of heterozygote status through NBS. Although more research is needed, this minireview of the SCT and CF literature to date leads us to propose that blanket terms such as "healthy heterozygotes" or "unaffected carriers" should be superseded in communications about NBS results, in favor of a more nuanced paradigm of setting expectations for health outcomes with "genotype-to-risk." In the molecular era of NBS, it remains clear that public health needs to become better prepared for the full range of applied genetics.
34210267	Health services use by children identified as heterozygous hemoglobinopathy mutation carriers via newborn screening.	BACKGROUND: Newborn screening (NBS) for sickle cell disease incidentally identifies heterozygous carriers of hemoglobinopathy mutations. In Ontario, Canada, these carrier results are not routinely disclosed, presenting an opportunity to investigate the potential health implications of carrier status. We aimed to compare rates of health services use among children identified as carriers of hemoglobinopathy mutations and those who received negative NBS results. METHODS: Eligible children underwent NBS in Ontario from October 2006 to March 2010 and were identified as carriers or as screen-negative controls, matched to carriers 5:1 based on neighbourhood and timing of birth. We used health care administrative data to determine frequencies of inpatient hospitalizations, emergency department (ED) visits, and physician encounters through March 2012, using multivariable negative binomial regression to compare rates of service use in the two cohorts. We analyzed data from 4987 carriers and 24,935 controls. RESULTS: Adjusted incidence rate ratios (95% CI) for service use in carriers versus controls among children < 1 year of age were: 1.11 (1.06-1.17) for ED visits; 0.97 (0.89-1.06) for inpatient hospitalization; and 1.02 (1.00-1.04) for physician encounters. Among children >=1 year of age, adjusted rate ratios were: 1.03 (0.98-1.07) for ED visits; 1.14 (1.03-1.25) for inpatient hospitalization and 0.92 (0.90-0.94) for physician encounters. CONCLUSIONS: While we identified statistically significant differences in health services use among carriers of hemoglobinopathy mutations relative to controls, effect sizes were small and directions of association inconsistent across age groups and health service types. Our findings are consistent with the assumption that carrier status is likely benign in early childhood.
32458066	Sleep disturbance in adults with sickle cell disease: relationships with executive and psychological functioning.	Sleep disturbance is common among children with sickle cell disease (SCD) and is related to neurocognitive difficulties. However, research on sleep disturbances and related variables among adults with SCD is extremely limited. The present study examined the relationship between sleep, executive functioning, and emotional functioning among 62 adults (29 females; M age = 32 years, SD = 7.79) with SCD preparing to undergo a stem cell transplant. Participants were administered a neurocognitive evaluation that included objective and subjective measures of executive functioning, and they completed PROMIS self-report measures of anxiety, depression, and pain intensity. Results showed that about 17% of participants endorsed clinically significant sleep disruptions, while 16.1% and 8% endorsed clinically significant symptoms of anxiety and depression, respectively. Sleep disturbance in these adults was not significantly correlated with objective or subjective measures of executive functioning. Moreover, anxiety, but not depression, was a significant mediator between self-reported sleep difficulties and both objective and subjective measures of executive functioning while controlling for pain intensity. Future research on sleep interventions will be essential for ameliorating the effects of sleep disturbance on executive functioning and anxiety among adults with SCD.
35373382	Beta-thalassemia and the advent of new interventions beyond transfusion and iron chelation.	Beta-thalassaemia, including sickle cell anaemia and thalassaemia E, is most common in developing countries in tropical and subtropic regions. Because carriers have migrated there owing to demographic migration, beta-thalassaemia can now be detected in areas other than malaria-endemic areas. Every year, an estimated 300 000-500 000 infants, the vast majority of whom are from developing countries, are born with a severe haemoglobin anomaly. Currently, some basic techniques, which include iron chelation therapy, hydroxyurea, blood transfusion, splenectomy and haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, are being used to manage thalassaemia patients. Despite being the backbone of treatment, traditional techniques have several drawbacks and limitations. Ineffective erythropoiesis, correction of globin chain imbalance and adjustment of iron metabolism are some of the innovative treatment methods that have been developed in the care of thalassaemia patients in recent years. Moreover, regulating the expression of B-cell lymphoma/leukaemia 11A and sex-determining region Y-box through the enhanced expression of micro RNAs can also be considered putative targets for managing haemoglobinopathies. This review focuses on the biological basis of beta-globin gene production, the pathophysiology of beta-thalassaemia and the treatment options that have recently been introduced.
34148067	Increased non-typhoidal Salmonella hospitalizations in transfusion-naive thalassemia children: a nationwide population-based cohort study.	INTRODUCTION: Although non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) infection usually causes self-limited enterocolitis, several risk factors have been found to predispose individuals to more severe NTS infections. However, few studies have discussed the association between NTS infection and pediatric thalassemia populations. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A nationwide population-based retrospective cohort study was conducted using medical records of the selected children from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. Immunocompromised individuals or patients with a history of transfusion or splenectomy were excluded. One thalassemia patient was matched with four non-thalassemia patients based on their year of birth, sex, and urbanization level. RESULTS: In this cohort, 912 patients with thalassemia and 3648 comparison cohort were analyzed. The mean age of NTS hospitalization was 2.0 +- 1.4 in thalassemia cohort and 2.6 +- 2.4 in non-thalassemia cohort. Transfusion-naive thalassemia children were proved to have a higher rate of NTS hospitalization (6.90 vs 4.11 per 1000 person-year; p = 0.0004) than the non-thalassemia cohort, with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.68 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.26-2.24). CONCLUSION: Our research shows that transfusion-naive thalassemia is associated with an increased risk of NTS hospitalization. Further prospective study comparing the incidence and severity of NTS infection among children with and without thalassemia is needed. IMPACT: Pediatric transfusion-naive thalassemia patients have an 1.68-fold increased risk for hospitalization due to non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) infection. This is the first nationwide population-based cohort study based on an extremely large database that shows pediatric transfusion-naive thalassemia patients have an increased risk for NTS hospitalizations. Besides the previously known risk factors such as extremes of age, sickle cell disease, or immunosuppressing conditions, clinicians must also take thalassemia as a possible risk factor for more severe NTS disease.
36476798	[Application of genome editing technology in gene therapy].	Genome editing has been attracting increasing attention as a new treatment for several refractory diseases since the CRISPR-Cas discovery has facilitated easy modification of target chromosomal DNA. The concept of treating refractory diseases by genome editing has been achieved in various animal models, and genome editing has been applied to human clinical trials for beta-thalassemia, sickle cell disease, mucopolysaccharidosis, transthyretin amyloidosis, HIV infection, and CAR-T therapy. The genome editing technology targets the germline in industrial applications in animals and plants and is directed at the chromosomal DNA of the somatic cells in human therapeutic applications. Genome editing therapy for germline cells is currently forbidden due to ethical and safety concerns. Concerns regarding genome editing technology include safety (off-target effects) as well as technical aspects (low homologous recombination). Various technological innovations for genome editing are expected to expand its clinical application to various diseases in the future.

33034214	What is the future of patient-reported outcomes in sickle-cell disease?	INTRODUCTION: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a complex, chronic disease caused by abnormal polymerization of hemoglobin, which leads to severe pain episodes, fatigue, and end-organ damage. Patient reported outcomes (PROs) have emerged as a critical tool for measuring SCD disease severity and response to treatment. AREAS COVERED: Authors review the key issues involved when deciding to use a PRO in a clinical trial. We describe the most highly recommended generic and disease-specific PRO tools in SCD and discuss the challenges of incorporating them in clinical practice. EXPERT OPINION: PRO measures are essential to incorporate into SCD clinical trials either as primary or secondary outcomes. The use of PRO measures in SCD facilitates a patient-centered approach, which is likely to lead to improved outcomes. Significant challenges remain in adapting PRO tools to routine clinical use and in developing countries.
32224022	The Effect of Progressive Muscle Relaxation Exercises on Pain on Patients with Sickle Cell Disease: Randomized Controlled Study.	PURPOSE: The study aimed to evaluate the effect of progressive muscle relaxation exercises on pain in patients with sickle cell disease. MATERIALS-METHOD: This randomized controlled interventional study was conducted in a hospital in Mersin, Turkey between October 2017 and July 2018. The study sample comprised 58 patients who were aged >18 years, conscious, had sickle cell disease, reported pain, and were treated with non-opioid or weak opioid analgesic based on the physician's recommendation (treatment group = 29, control group = 29). Data were collected by the individual presentation form and visual analog scale. During the study, both groups were treated with analgesics prescribed by the physician for three days. In addition to the analgesics, the treatment group was performed progressive muscle relaxation exercises for 30 minutes whereas the control group was rested. Pain level of both groups was evaluated at three time points every day for three days. In the study, frequency distributions and descriptive statistics were presented for categorical and numerical variables, respectively. Chi-square analysis, independent samples t-test, Mann-Whitney U test, three-way ANOVA, and Sidak test were used to analyze the difference between the variables. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 29.59 +- 6.94 years, and 53.4% of the patients were female and 69% were single. The mean pain score of the treatment group at the third time point on days 1, 2, and 3 was significantly lower than the control group (p < .05). There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of coping methods for pain, pain location, and complaints accompanying pain (p > .05). CONCLUSION: Progressive muscle relaxation exercises were found to be effective in the pain management of patients with sickle cell anemia.
33648529	A comprehensive review of hydroxyurea for beta-haemoglobinopathies: the role revisited during COVID-19 pandemic.	BACKGROUND: Hydroxyurea is one of the earliest drugs that showed promise in the management of haemoglobinopathies that include beta-thalassaemia and sickle cell disease. Despite this, many aspects of hydroxyurea are either unknown or understudied; specifically, its usefulness in beta-thalassaemia major and haemoglobin E beta-thalassaemia is unclear. However, during COVID-19 pandemic, it has become a valuable adjunct to transfusion therapy in patients with beta-haemoglobinopathies. In this review, we aim to explore the available in vitro and in vivo mechanistic data and the clinical utility of hydroxyurea in beta-haemoglobinopathies with a special emphasis on its usefulness during the COVID-19 pandemic. MAIN BODY: Hydroxyurea is an S-phase-specific drug that reversibly inhibits ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase enzyme which catalyses an essential step in the DNA biosynthesis. In human erythroid cells, it induces the expression of gamma-globin, a fetal globin gene that is suppressed after birth. Through several molecular pathways described in this review, hydroxyurea exerts many favourable effects on the haemoglobin content, red blood cell indices, ineffective erythropoiesis, and blood rheology in patients with beta-haemoglobinopathies. Currently, it is recommended for sickle cell disease and non-transfusion dependent beta-thalassaemia. A number of clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate its usefulness in transfusion dependent beta-thalassaemia. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it was widely used as an adjunct to transfusion therapy due to limitations in the availability of blood and logistical disturbances. Thus, it has become clear that hydroxyurea could play a remarkable role in reducing transfusion requirements of patients with haemoglobinopathies, especially when donor blood is a limited resource. CONCLUSION: Hydroxyurea is a well-tolerated oral drug which has been in use for many decades. Through its actions of reversible inhibition of ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase enzyme and fetal haemoglobin induction, it exerts many favourable effects on patients with beta-haemoglobinopathies. It is currently approved for the treatment of sickle cell disease and non-transfusion dependent beta-thalassaemia. Also, there are various observations to suggest that hydroxyurea is an important adjunct in the treatment of transfusion dependent beta-thalassaemia which should be confirmed by randomised clinical trials.

37309794	[What is your diagnosis? Inveterate anterior shoulder dislocation].	THERAPEUTIC APPROACHES IN SICKLE CELL DISEASE. Sickle cell disease, the most common genetic disease in France, is still burdened with morbidity and early mortality before the age of 50. When the first-line treatment, hydroxyurea, is insufficient or in the case of organic damage(s) (in particular cerebral vasculopathy), a therapeutic intensification must be considered. New molecules are now available, such as voxelotor and crizanlizumab, but only hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation can cure the disease. Allogeneic HSC transplantation during childhood with a sibling donor is the reference but it is now possible to perform this procedure in adults with a reduced pre-transplant conditioning. Gene therapy, which consists of an autograft of genetically modified HSCs, has obtained promising results but has not yet demonstrated a complete cure of the disease (protocols underway). The toxicity of myeloablative conditioning (used in pediatrics or for gene therapy), particularly the sterility induced, and the risk of graft-versushost disease (for allogeneic transplantation) are limiting factors of these treatments.
35934593	Effective therapies for sickle cell disease: are we there yet?	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a common genetic blood disorder associated with acute and chronic pain, progressive multiorgan damage, and early mortality. Recent advances in technologies to manipulate the human genome, a century of research and the development of techniques enabling the isolation, efficient genetic modification, and reimplantation of autologous patient hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), mean that curing most patients with SCD could soon be a reality in wealthy countries. In parallel, ongoing research is pursuing more facile treatments, such as in-vivo-delivered genetic therapies and new drugs that can eventually be administered in low- and middle-income countries where most SCD patients reside.
34191365	Further evidence for the benefit of therapeutic plasma exchange for acute multi-organ failure syndrome refractory to red cell exchange in sickle cell disease.	Acute multiorgan failure syndrome (MOFS) remains a significant cause of mortality in sickle cell disease (SCD) patients despite red cell exchange (RCE). In small case series and reports, therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) has shown benefit in MOFS. As further support for consideration of this modality, we present two patients with SCD and MOFS refractory to RCE who were subsequently treated with TPE. Fresh frozen plasma was used as the replacement fluid. Despite estimated hospital mortality of 40% at the time of intensive care unit admission, both patients showed marked clinical improvement with TPE treatment. Our cases add to the evidence supporting the potential inclusion of MOFS secondary to acute SCD as an indication for TPE in the next edition of the American Society of Apheresis Guidelines on the Use of Therapeutic Apheresis in Clinical Practice.
33019301	Measuring Pain in Sickle Cell Disease using Clinical Text.	Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is a hereditary disorder of red blood cells in humans. Complications such as pain, stroke, and organ failure occur in SCD as malformed, sickled red blood cells passing through small blood vessels get trapped. Particularly, acute pain is known to be the primary symptom of SCD. The insidious and subjective nature of SCD pain leads to challenges in pain assessment among Medical Practitioners (MPs). Thus, accurate identification of markers of pain in patients with SCD is crucial for pain management. Classifying clinical notes of patients with SCD based on their pain level enables MPs to give appropriate treatment. We propose a binary classification model to predict pain relevance of clinical notes and a multiclass classification model to predict pain level. While our four binary machine learning (ML) classifiers are comparable in their performance, Decision Trees had the best performance for the multiclass classification task achieving 0.70 in F-measure. Our results show the potential clinical text analysis and machine learning offer to pain management in sickle cell patients.
35645211	Comparative evaluation of efficacy and safety of automated versus manual red cell exchange in sickle cell disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Exchange transfusion is a valuable treatment option in sickle cell disease (SCD) and is preferred over simple transfusion as it removes abnormal haemoglobin S (HbS) levels and reduces complications. This meta-analysis aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety profile of automated red cell exchange (aRBX) procedure over manual red cell exchange transfusion (MET) in SCD patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A standard meta-analysis protocol was developed, and after performing a comprehensive literature search in PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane and International Clinical Trial Registry Platform (ICTRP), reviewers assessed eligibility and extracted data from nine relevant studies. A random effects model was used to estimate the pooled effect size calculated from the mean difference in HbS percentage, serum ferritin level and risk ratio for the adverse events. Quality assessment was done using the risk-of-bias assessment tool, and a summary of observations was prepared using standard Cochrane methodology with GradePro GDT. RESULTS: The random-model analysis revealed a mean difference of 4.10 (95% CI: -3.29-11.49; Z = 1.09; p = 0.28) for HbS percentage, mean difference of 435.29 (95% CI: -73.74-944.32; Z = 1.68; p = 0.09) for serum ferritin and pooled risk ratio of 1.35 (95% CI: 0.63-2.87; Z = 0.77; p = 0.44) for adverse events. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis did not reveal any significant benefit of aRBX in reducing HbS percentage and attenuating the serum ferritin level when compared with MET. There was also no significant increased risk of adverse events detected in association with aRBX.

38506450	Post-transfusion biotin-labeled red blood cell survival studies in pediatric sickle cell disease with antibodies of uncertain significance.	BACKGROUND: Red blood cell (RBC) antibodies are common in multiply transfused patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Unlike RBC alloantibodies, the potential of autoantibodies to cause post-transfusion hemolysis may be uncertain. Biotin-labeling provides a direct measurement of red cell survival (RCS) over time, thus can be used to assess the clinical significance of RBC antibodies. Antibodies to biotinylated RBC (B-RBC) occasionally are detected after exposure, which may impact B-RBC survival in subsequent RCS studies. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Pediatric patients with SCD receiving monthly chronic transfusions underwent RCS studies, receiving aliquots of allogeneic RBC labeled at distinct densities of biotin (2-18 mug/mL). B-RBC survival was followed for 4 months post-transfusion, and B-RBC antibody screening for 6 months. Patients with warm autoantibodies (WAA) or B-RBC antibodies are reported here. RESULTS: RBC antibodies were detected during RCS in four patients: one with WAA, one with WAA followed by B-RBC-specific antibodies, and two with transient B-RBC antibodies within the first 5 weeks of exposure. B-RBC half-lives (T50 ) ranged 37.6-61.7 days (mean 47.8 days). There was no evidence of increased hemolysis or accelerated B-RBC clearance in the presence of WAA or B-RBC antibodies. DISCUSSION: Biotinylation of allogenic RBC can be used to assess the possible effects of RBC antibodies on transfusion survival in individual cases, particularly when it is uncertain if the detected antibodies may result in hemolysis. In the cases presented here, neither WAA nor B-RBC antibodies were associated with significant shortening of B-RBC survival in individuals with SCD.
33405370	Hematopoietic stem cell transplant referral patterns for children with sickle cell disease vary among pediatric hematologist/oncologists' practice focus: A Sickle Cell Transplant Advocacy and Research Alliance (STAR) study.	BACKGROUND: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) provides a curative therapy for children severely affected by sickle cell disease (SCD). Rejection-free survival after matched sibling donor (MSD) HSCT is very high, but adoption of HSCT as a curative SCD therapy has been slow. In this study, we assess providers' perceptions about MSD HSCT for children with variable SCD severity, and determine the influence of provider characteristics on HSCT referrals. PROCEDURE: After our Institutional Review Board deemed the study exempt, American Society of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology Clinical Forum listserv subscribers and American Society of Hematology members who self-identified as pediatric hematologists/oncologists (PHO) were emailed a survey. Analysis was performed to describe and evaluate correlations between participant demographics (including practice focus within PHO) and likelihood of HSCT referral for each scenario. RESULTS: Spearman's rank correlation analysis did not reveal any significant relationship between demographic characteristics except practice focus and likelihood to refer to HSCT for any scenarios. Providers focused on SCD and HSCT were more likely to refer a child who had never been admitted to the hospital or had suboptimal adherence to hydroxyurea than general PHOs. A significantly higher proportion of all respondents would refer a child with beta-thalassemia major (87%) than an asymptomatic child with HbSS (47%, P < .00001) or non-HbSS variant (23%, P < .00001). CONCLUSION: PSCD and HSCT physicians are more likely to refer for MSD HSCT in almost every condition than general PHO practitioners, likely because of increased awareness of long-term effects of SCD and safety of MSD HSCT for children with SCD.
38181784	In vivo measurement of RBC survival in patients with sickle cell disease before or after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.	Stable, mixed donor-recipient chimerism after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) is sufficient for phenotypic disease reversal and results from differences in donor/recipient red blood cell (RBC) survival. Understanding variability and predictors of RBC survival among patients with SCD before and after HSCT is critical for gene therapy research which seeks to generate sufficient corrected hemoglobin to reduce polymerization thereby overcoming the red cell pathology of SCD. This study utilized biotin-labeling of RBCs to determine the lifespan of RBCs in patients with SCD compared to patients who have successfully undergone curative HSCT, participants with sickle cell trait (HbAS), and healthy (HbAA) donors (NCT04476277). Twenty participants were included in the analysis (N=6 SCD pre-HSCT, N=5 SCD post-HSCT, N=6 HbAS, N=3 HbAA). The average RBC lifespan was significantly shorter for participants with SCD pre-HSCT (64.1 days, range 35-91) compared to those with SCD post-HSCT (113.4 days, range 105-119), HbAS (126.0 days, range 119-147), and HbAA (123.7 days, range 91-147) (p<0.001). RBC lifespan correlated with various hematologic parameters, and strongly correlated with the average final fraction of sickled RBCs after deoxygenation (p<0.001). No adverse events were attributable to the use of biotin and related procedures. Biotin labeling of RBCs is a safe and feasible methodology to evaluate RBC survival in patients with SCD before and after HSCT. Understanding differences in RBC survival may ultimately guide gene therapy protocols to determine hemoglobin composition required to reverse the SCD phenotype as it relates directly to RBC survival.
33044907	The Meaning of Informed Consent: Genome Editing Clinical Trials for Sickle Cell Disease.	BACKGROUND: A first therapeutic target of somatic genome editing (SGE) is sickle cell disease (SCD), the most commonly inherited blood disorders, affecting more than 100,000 individuals in the United States. Advancement of SGE is contingent on patient participation in first in human clinical trials. However, seriously ill patients may be vulnerable to overestimating the benefits of early phase studies while underestimating the risks. Therefore, ensuring potential clinical trial participants are fully informed prior to participating in a SGE clinical trial is critical. Methods: We conducted a mixed-methods study of adults with SCD as well as parents and physicians of individuals with SCD. Participants were asked to complete a genetic literacy survey, watch an educational video about genome editing, complete a two-part survey, and take part in focus group discussions. Focus groups addressed topics on clinical trials, ethics of gene editing, and what is not understood regarding gene editing. All focus groups were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using conventional content analysis techniques to identify major themes. Results: Our study examined the views of SCD stakeholders regarding what they want and need to know about genome editing to make an informed decision to participate in a SGE clinical trial. Prominent themes included stakeholders' desire to understand treatment side effects, mechanism of action of SGE, trial qualification criteria, and the impact of SGE on quality of life. In addition, some physicians expressed concerns about the extent to which their patients would understand concepts related to SGE; however, individuals with SCD demonstrated higher levels of genetic literacy than estimated by physicians. Conclusions: Designing ethically robust genome editing clinical trials for the SCD population will require, at a minimum, addressing the expressed information needs of the community through culturally sensitive engagement, so that they can make informed decisions to consider participation in clinical trials.
33787937	Evidence for Prophylactic Transfusion during Pregnancy for Women with Sickle Cell Disease.	The objective of this study was to examine prior studies on maternal and neonatal outcomes with prophylactic compared with emergent blood transfusion in pregnant women with sickle cell disease. A review of the literature was performed. Twenty-one articles were identified and included in the analysis. A generalized linear mixed-effects model was used to analyze the outcomes. Pregnancy outcomes assessed were preeclampsia, pneumonia, pyelonephritis, pain crises, intrauterine growth restriction, neonatal death, perinatal death, and maternal mortality. Women who underwent emergent transfusion were more likely than women who underwent prophylactic transfusion to have the following adverse perinatal outcomes: preterm delivery (adjusted odds ratio [aOR 2.04], 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14-3.63), pneumonia (aOR 2.98, 95% CI 1.44-6.15), pain crises (aOR 1.67, 95% CI 1.18-2.38), and perinatal death (aOR 1.84, 95% CI 1.06-3.07). Prophylactic transfusion should be reexamined as a potentially beneficial approach to the management of sickle cell disease in pregnancy.
32561028	Risk factors for hemolytic transfusion reactions resulting from ABO and minor red cell antigen incompatibility: From mislabeled samples to stem cell transplant and sickle cell disease.	Advances in laboratory testing, pathogen reduction and donor qualification have dramatically reduced the risk of acquiring an infection from a blood transfusion. Despite this progress, the most feared complication of transfusion - a hemolytic reaction due to incompatibility between donor and recipient - remains, with essentially no recent progress in the prevention or recognition of this rare but frequently lethal complication. Herein, the role that compatibility testing and transfusion practice play in the occurrence of acute hemolysis are described, with a special emphasis on clinical scenarios confer an increased risk of a severe hemolytic reaction in response to red blood cell or platelet transfusion. In addition, the signs and symptoms of a severe hemolytic reaction are summarized, along with the initial approach to clinical management.
35811546	Practices of sickle cell disease genetic screening and testing in the prenatal population.	BACKGROUND: Genetic screening and testing are technologies historically underutilized in Black populations despite predicting diseases like sickle cell disease (SCD), which is predominantly found in Blacks. We surveyed prenatal patients to understand choices, beliefs and experiences surrounding genetic screening and testing, specifically for SCD. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we surveyed 322 women during prenatal visits. Responses were analyzed to identify barriers to care and education about testing and screening for SCD. Patients rated whether they agreed or disagreed with statements regarding sickle cell health behaviors. We used chi2 tests to compare categorical variables by self-reported race. Binary logistic regression was used to determine the odds ratios and confidence intervals for each outcome. RESULTS: Women were a mean (SD) age of 33.3 (6.1). 42.9% of patients self-identified as White while 41.3% of patients self- identified as Black. Screening questions were adjusted for differences in race, insurance, and education levels to show significant differences in responses between Blacks and Whites for screening for SCD (p = 0.047, OR 95% CI = 0.455 [0.210-0.989]) and plans to meet with genetic counselors (p = 0.049, OR 95% CI = 0.299 [0.090-0.993]). The statements "if sickle cell is not in their family, then it is likely not in themselves or their children," was significantly different between Black and White populations (p = 0.011, OR 95% CI = 0.207 [0.081-0.526]). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest gaps in screening, testing, education, and pregnancy management choices between Black and White patients. Research should focus on decreasing these healthcare gaps and improving education that address concerns about SCD for relevant populations.
36755516	An evaluation of deferiprone as twice-a-day tablets or in combination therapy for the treatment of transfusional iron overload in thalassemia syndromes.	INTRODUCTION: Regular blood transfusions in patients with thalassemia syndromes can cause iron overload resulting in complications including cirrhosis, heart problems, or endocrine abnormalities. To prevent iron overload toxicity in these patients, three iron chelators are currently FDA-approved for use: deferoxamine, deferasirox, and deferiprone. In the United States, deferiprone has been approved for three times daily dosing since 2011 and has recently gained approval for twice-daily administration. AREAS COVERED: A PubMed literature search was performed with the keywords 'deferiprone' and 'thalassemia.' Relevant original research studying deferiprone's effects on transfusional iron overload in patients with thalassemia syndromes was included. Exclusion criteria included case reports and review papers. Deferiprone is effective at reducing serum ferritin levels in patients with iron overload. Twice-daily administration provides a similar level of iron chelation as three times daily dosing with a comparable side effect profile and increased patient acceptability. EXPERT OPINION: New studies are highlighting deferiprone's potential for combination therapy with either deferoxamine or deferasirox to improve iron chelation. Deferiprone's ability to significantly decrease cardiac and liver iron content can be utilized in other transfusion-dependent hematologic conditions, as evidenced by its recent approval for use in the United States for sickle cell disease or other anemias.
36634737	Physical, Mental, and Social Health of Adult Patients with Sickle Cell Disease after Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation: A Mixed-Methods Study.	Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) experience a considerable physical and psychosocial disease burden. In recent years, the application of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) to treat adults with SCD has increased. A thorough understanding of patients' physical, mental, and social health before and after cure is needed to meet the needs of this growing group of patients. We aimed to explore the perspectives of adult SCD patients on the changes in their experienced health and personal life goals after being cured. A mixed-methods approach was used, comprising a semistructured interview and a set of 9 Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) measures. Adult SCD patients who underwent HSCT at least 1 year earlier were eligible to participate in the study. Interviews were thematically analyzed using MAXQDA software. PROMIS T scores were compared with reference scores of the general population using SPSS Statistics. Ten patients participated in the study; their median age was 29.5 years (range, 19 to 49 years), and their median time since HSCT was 2.7 years (range, 1.0 to 3.5 years). Themes from the interviews were (1) pain/living pain free, (2) physical well-being, (3) mental well-being, (4) perspective/ outlook, (5) education/work, (6) family/friends, and (7) activities/participation. Following the PROMIS framework, we described these themes in a narrative synthesis according to health domain and categorized in 4 chronological time phases: before HSCT, first year post-transplantation, current situation, and future expectations. Physical health improved greatly, but transplantation-related toxicity, ongoing pain from avascular osteonecrosis, and fatigue negatively impacted quality of life in some patients. Furthermore, emotional struggles during the post-transplantation period were common, and patients expressed a need for psychological help. Patients reported improvements in social health and the ability to pursue personal life goals. The mean T scores of all PROMIS measures fell within the normal symptom limits compared with reference data of the general population, although, large variations were observed among the participants, matching our qualitative findings. In general, adult SCD patients experienced improved physical, mental, and social health after cure by HSCT and were able to pursue personal life goals. Yet they found themselves confronted with a new and unfamiliar reality that brought different challenges. Pain due to irreversible avascular osteonecrosis continued to have a negative impact. Clinicians should aim to help patients have realistic expectations before transplantation and offer timely psychological care.
32240772	Outcomes after Cholecystectomy in Patients with Sickle Cell Disease: Does Acuity of Presentation Play a Role?	BACKGROUND: Cholecystectomy is the most commonly performed procedure in sickle cell disease (SCD) patients, but outcomes after cholecystectomy have not been well studied. Our aim was to explore the characteristics and outcomes of cholecystectomy in patients with SCD compared with patients without SCD, and assess whether acuity of presentation played a role. STUDY DESIGN: Patients younger than age 35, with the primary diagnosis of gallbladder disease, who underwent cholecystectomy, were identified in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2005 to 2014). Patients were grouped into treatment groups by sickle cell status and acuity of surgery. Patient demographics, length of stay, hospital charges, and complications were evaluated. Descriptive and multivariate regression analyses were performed to compare these groups. RESULTS: There were 149,415 patients analyzed; 1,225 (0.82%) had SCD. SCD was associated with higher complication rates (2.69% vs 1.12%), longer lengths of stay (3 days vs 2 days), and higher median hospital charge ($29,170 vs $25,438) (all p < 0.01). Stratified by level of acuity, comparing the SCD group with the non-SCD group, higher complication rates were seen in the acute presentation group (3.92% vs 1.00%, p < 0.01), but were not demonstrated in the elective group (0.98% vs 1.95%, p = 0.114). CONCLUSIONS: SCD patients appear to have a longer length of stay, higher hospital spending, and increased complication rates compared with non-SCD patients undergoing cholecystectomy. This difference is pronounced among patients who underwent surgery in the acute setting. The data suggest that planned cholecystectomy may be beneficial in improving postoperative outcomes in SCD patients.
33509861	Diverse manifestations of a sickle cell crisis.	We describe the case of a 21-year-old man with a background of sickle cell disease (SCD) who was on acute presentation in a sickle cell crisis required immediate intensive care admission with red blood cell exchange and ventilatory support. He had right frontal lobe infarcts and extensive bilateral deep white matter lesions most likely secondary to fat embolism. Inpatient investigations demonstrated a patent foramen ovale, explaining the route of spread of the fat embolus. He then had a transcatheter closure of the atrial defect. The patient needed prolonged inpatient rehabilitation. He was discharged from hospital in a wheelchair secondary to severe lower limb neurology and bilateral knee heterotopic ossification. He lives with the possibility of early onset dementia and cognitive decline, requiring constant care. The case highlights the multiple manifestations of SCD and their diverse and debilitating consequences.
36353243	Fertility preservation for pediatric patients with hemoglobinopathies: Multidisciplinary counseling needed to optimize outcomes.	Hemoglobinopathies are autosomal recessive disorders that occur when genetic mutations negatively impact the function of hemoglobin. Common hemoglobinopathies that are clinically significant include sickle cell disease, alpha thalassemia, and beta thalassemia. Advancements in disease-modifying and curative treatments for the common hemoglobinopathies over the past thirty years have led to improvements in patient quality of life and longevity for those who are affected. However, the diseases, their treatments and cures pose infertility risks, making fertility preservation counseling and treatment an important part of the contemporary comprehensive patient care. Sickle cell disease negatively impacts both male and female infertility, primarily by testicular failure and decreased ovarian reserve, respectively. Fertility in both males and females with beta thalassemia major are negatively impacted by iron deposition due to chronic blood transfusions. Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is currently the only curative treatment for SCD and transfusion dependent beta thalassemia. Many of the conditioning regimens for HSCT contain chemotherapeutic agents with known gonadotoxicity and whole-body radiation. Although most clinical studies on toxicity and impact of HSCT on long-term health do not evaluate fertility, gonadal failure is common. Male fertility preservation modalities that exist prior to gonadotoxic treatment include sperm banking for pubertal males and testicular cryopreservation for pre-pubertal boys. For female patients, fertility preservation options include oocyte cryopreservation and ovarian tissue cryopreservation. Oocyte cryopreservation requires controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) with ten to fourteen days of intensive monitoring and medication administration. This is feasible once the patient has undergone menarche. Follicular growth is monitored via transvaginal or transabdominal ultrasound, and hormone levels are monitored through frequent blood work. Oocytes are then harvested via a minimally invasive approach under anesthesia. Complications of COH are more common in patients with hemoglobinopathies. Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome creates a greater risk to patients with underlying vascular, pulmonary, and renal injury, as they may be less able to tolerate fluids shifts. Thus, it is critical to monitor patients undergoing COH closely with close collaboration between the hematology team and the reproductive endocrinology team. Counseling patients and families about future fertility must take into consideration the patient's disease, treatment history, and planned treatment, acknowledging current knowledge gaps.
33547762	The Rh blood group system and its role in alloimmunization rate among sickle cell disease and sickle thalassemia patients in Iran.	INTRODUCTION: The alloimmunization following blood transfusion can be life-threatening. The Rh alloantibodies are one of the most common causes contributing to alloimmunization. This study aimed to evaluate the rate and causes of alloimmunization and to determine the Rh phenotypes and genotypes among sickle cell disease (SCD) and sickle thalassemia (Sbeta). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our study included 104 SCD and Sbeta patients referring to Baghaei 2 Hospital of Ahvaz in 2019 using a non-random simple sampling method. The blood samples were collected for Rh phenotypes, alloantibody screening and identification, and molecular tests. The SSP-PCR and RFLP methods with the Pst 1 enzyme were used. RESULTS: The alloimmunization rate was 9.6% and 13.2% based on immunohematological tests and medical records, respectively. The main alloantibodies (90%) were anti-Rh, and 40% of the patients had multiple alloantibodies. A significant correlation was found between gender and alloimmunization. The phenotypes of DCce (37.5%), DCcEe (24%), Dce (20.2%), and dce (5.8%) and genotypes of R1r (25%), R1R2 (20.2%), R1R1 (18.3%), and R1R0 (10.6%) were the most prevalent. The R1R2 was a frequent genotype in Sbeta. CONCLUSION: R0r' and R1R0 genotypes were limited to our population in Iran. Due to the differences in RH genotypes between our population and others, the blood transfusion from other ethnicities increased our total alloimmunization rate.
38066927	Gene therapy for sickle cell disease.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is potentially curable after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or autologous HSCT after ex vivo genetic modification. Autologous HSCT with gene therapy has the potential to overcome many of the limitations of allogeneic HSCT that include the lack of suitable donors, graft-versus-host disease, the need for immune suppression, and the potential for graft rejection. Significant progress in gene therapy for SCD has been made over the past several decades, now with a growing number of clinical trials investigating various gene addition and gene editing strategies. Available results from a small number of patients, some with relatively short follow-up, are promising as a potentially curative strategy, with current efforts focused on continuing to improve the efficacy, durability, and safety of gene therapies for the cure of SCD.

38551525	Droplet digital polymerase chain reaction-based quantitation of therapeutic lentiviral vector copies in transduced hematopoietic stem cells.	BACKGROUND AIMS: Gene therapy using lentiviral vectors (LVs) that harbor a functional beta-globin gene provides a curative treatment for hemoglobinopathies including beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease. Accurate quantification of the vector copy number (VCN) and/or the proportion of transduced cells is critical to evaluate the efficacy of transduction and stability of the transgene during treatment. Moreover, commonly used techniques for LV quantification, including real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or fluorescence-activated cell sorting, require either a standard curve or expression of a reporter protein for the detection of transduced cells. In the present study, we describe a digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) technique to measure the lentiviral VCN in transduced hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). METHODS: After HSPCs were transduced with an LV encoding the therapeutic beta-globin (betaA-T87Q) gene, the integrated lentiviral sequence in the host genome was amplified with primers that targeted a sequence within the vector and the human RPP30 gene. The dynamic range of ddPCR was between 5 x 10-3 ng and 5 x 10-6 ng of target copy per reaction. RESULTS: We found that the ddPCR-based approach was able to estimate VCN with high sensitivity and a low standard deviation. Furthermore, ddPCR-mediated quantitation of lentiviral copy numbers in differentiated erythroblasts correlated with the level of betaA-T87Q protein detected by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the ddPCR technique has the potential to precisely detect LV copy numbers in the host genome, which can be used for VCN estimation, calculation of infectious titer and multiplicity of infection for HSPC transduction in a clinical setting.
32183478	Maternal Dietary Intakes, Red Blood Cell Indices and Risk for Anemia in the First, Second and Third Trimesters of Pregnancy and at Predelivery.	As anemia remains a major public health problem in Ghana, we examined the effect of dietary intakes, and antenatal care (ANC) practices on red cell indices and anemia prevalence during the pregnancy continuum for 415 women. Dietary history was taken using the Food and Agriculture Organization minimum dietary diversity indicator for women (MDD-W). Intake of >=5 food groups was a proxy for micronutrient adequacy. Odds for anemia and meeting the MDD-W were estimated using ordinal and binary logistic regressions respectively. Intakes of 41.4% were micronutrient inadequate. At any time point in pregnancy, 54.4% were anemic (mild = 31.1%; moderate = 23.1%; severe = 0.2%) with 10%-point variation across the first (57.3%), second (56.4%) and third (53.3%) trimesters and pre-delivery (47.7%); 27.8% were anemic throughout pregnancy while 17.1% were never anemic. Morphologically, microcytic (79.4%) and hypochromic (29.3%) anemia were most prevalent, indicating nutritional deficiencies. Planning the pregnancy was a significant determinant for meeting the MDD-W. Overall, adolescence, poor diet, suboptimum ANC and underweight were associated with moderate and severe anemia. In specific time-points, dietary counselling, malaria, iron-folic acid supplementation, sickle cell disease and preeclampsia were observed. Decline of anemia during pregnancy suggests the positive impact of ANC services and supports strengthening education on dietary diversification during ANC.
32284612	Therapeutic base editing of human hematopoietic stem cells.	Base editing by nucleotide deaminases linked to programmable DNA-binding proteins represents a promising approach to permanently remedy blood disorders, although its application in engrafting hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) remains unexplored. In this study, we purified A3A (N57Q)-BE3 base editor for ribonucleoprotein (RNP) electroporation of human-peripheral-blood-mobilized CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). We observed frequent on-target cytosine base edits at the BCL11A erythroid enhancer at +58 with few indels. Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) induction in erythroid progeny after base editing or nuclease editing was similar. A single therapeutic base edit of the BCL11A enhancer prevented sickling and ameliorated globin chain imbalance in erythroid progeny from sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia patient-derived HSPCs, respectively. Moreover, efficient multiplex editing could be achieved with combined disruption of the BCL11A erythroid enhancer and correction of the HBB -28A>G promoter mutation. Finally, base edits could be produced in multilineage-repopulating self-renewing human HSCs with high frequency as assayed in primary and secondary recipient animals resulting in potent HbF induction in vivo. Together, these results demonstrate the potential of RNP base editing of human HSPCs as a feasible alternative to nuclease editing for HSC-targeted therapeutic genome modification.

36633226	Emergency department visits and hospitalizations for pediatric vaso-occlusive pain events during the COVID-19 pandemic.	The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic altered all aspects of life, including healthcare. During the pandemic, social distancing led to decreased transmission of typical viral illnesses, leading to a decrease in these pediatric admissions. Studies have shown that pediatric emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations decreased during the pandemic, which may have led to some unmet healthcare needs and delays in treatment. Little is known about the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on ED visits and hospitalizations specifically for pediatric sickle cell pain. A retrospective review across hospitals in the Northwell Health system was conducted to compare the ED visits and hospitalizations for pediatric patients with sickle cell pain during 2020 (the year of the pandemic), the following year (2021), and the 2 years prior to the pandemic (2018, 2019). The average length of stay for patients hospitalized with vaso-occlusive events was also compared between these years. Total 511 patient encounters for patients seen and discharged home from the ED and 985 hospitalization encounters were included over the 4-year timespan. ED visits per year decreased significantly in 2020 compared with the 2 years prior (p < .001): 91 visits in 2020, 162 visits in 2019, and 143 visits in 2018. The number of ED visits for pediatric vaso-occlusive events trended upward in 2021 to 115. Hospitalizations also decreased in 2020 compared to the 2 years prior (n = 202 vs 196; p < .001), compared with 298 in 2019 and 289 in 2018. The number of patients hospitalized remained stable in 2021 (n = 202 vs 196). There was a statistically significant increase in the median length of stay in 2020 compared to years prior (p = .002): median (interquartile range [IQR]): 4.0 days (2-6 days) in 2020 compared to 3.0 days (2-5 days) in 2018 and 2019. ED encounters and hospitalizations for pediatric patients with sickle cell disease pain decreased during the pandemic; however, admitted patients had a longer median length of stay.
34905048	Investigational curative gene therapy approaches to sickle cell disease.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited blood condition resulting from abnormal hemoglobin production. It is one of the most common genetic diseases in the world. The clinical manifestations are variable and range from recurrent acute and debilitating painful crises to life-threatening pulmonary, cardiovascular, renal, and neurologic complications. The only curative treatment of SCD at this time is bone marrow transplantation (also called hematopoietic stem cell transplantation) using healthy blood stem cells from an unaffected brother or sister or from an unrelated donor if one can be identified who is a match in tissue typing. Unfortunately, only a minority of patients with sickle cell has such a donor available. The use of autologous hematopoietic stem cells and alternative types of genetic modifications is currently under study in clinical research trials for this disease. The approaches include the use of viral vectors to express globin genes that are modified to prevent sickle hemoglobin polymerization or to express interfering RNAs to "flip the switch" in adult red cells from adult beta-sickle hemoglobin to fetal hemoglobin using a physiologic switch, and several gene editing approaches with the goal of inducing fetal hemoglobin or correcting/modifying the actual sickle mutation. In this audio review, we will discuss these different approaches and review the current progress of curative therapy for SCD using gene therapy.
34848756	Nationwide retrospective study of critically ill adults with sickle cell disease in France.	Little is known about patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) who require intensive care unit (ICU) admission. The goals of this study were to assess outcomes in patients admitted to the ICU for acute complications of SCD and to identify factors associated with adverse outcomes. This multicenter retrospective study included consecutive adults with SCD admitted to one of 17 participating ICUs. An adverse outcome was defined as death or a need for life-sustaining therapies (non-invasive or invasive ventilation, vasoactive drugs, renal replacement therapy, and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). Factors associated with adverse outcomes were identified by mixed multivariable logistic regression. We included 488 patients admitted in 2015-2017. The main reasons for ICU admission were acute chest syndrome (47.5%) and severely painful vaso-occlusive event (21.3%). Sixteen (3.3%) patients died in the ICU, mainly of multi-organ failure following a painful vaso-occlusive event or sepsis. An adverse outcome occurred in 81 (16.6%; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 13.3%-19.9%) patients. Independent factors associated with adverse outcomes were low mean arterial blood pressure (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.98; 95% CI 0.95-0.99; p = 0.027), faster respiratory rate (aOR, 1.09; 95% CI 1.05-1.14; p < 0.0001), higher haemoglobin level (aOR, 1.22; 95% CI 1.01-1.48; p = 0.038), impaired creatinine clearance at ICU admission (aOR, 0.98; 95% CI 0.97-0.98; p < 0.0001), and red blood cell exchange before ICU admission (aOR, 5.16; 95% CI 1.16-22.94; p = 0.031). Patients with SCD have a substantial risk of adverse outcomes if they require ICU admission. Early ICU admission should be encouraged in patients who develop abnormal physiological parameters.
37585480	Comparison of Thromboembolism Outcomes in Patients with Sickle Cell Disease Prescribed Hormonal Contraception.	Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) are at risk of thromboembolism (TE) and use of hormonal contraception can further increase that risk. This study aims to assess patterns of hormonal contraceptive use and compare risk of contraception-related TE between combined hormonal contraceptives (CHC) and progestin-only contraceptives (POC). Patients with SCD between 12-44 years with a new prescription of a hormonal contraceptive in the CMS MAX database (2006-2018) were followed for one year. Cox regression analysis was used to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) of TE. We identified 7,173 new users: 44.6% initiated CHC and 55.4% initiated POC. Combined oral contraceptive pills (OCP) (36.5%) and progestin-only depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (33.9%) were the most frequently prescribed agents. A total of 1.8% of contraception users had a new diagnosis of TE within one year of first identified contraception prescription. There were no significant differences in TE event rates between CHC and POC users (17.2 and 24.7 events per 1000 person-years respectively, adjusted HR=0.83, 95% CI: 0.58-1.21; p-value=0.336). In patients prescribed OCP, there were no differences in TE event rates based on estrogen dose or progestin generation. Transdermal patch had 2.4 fold increased risk of TE as compared to OCP. Although limited by the retrospective study design and use of administrative claims data, this study found no significant differences in TE rates between new users of CHC and POC in patients with SCD. Careful evaluation of underlying TE risk factors should be considered in each patient with SCD prior to initiation of hormonal contraception.
33254372	Fatal Brain Injury Following Carbon Dioxide Angiography.	INTRODUCTION: Carbon dioxide (CO2) as a contrast agent has been in use as early as the 1920s for visualization of retroperitoneal structures. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) using CO2 as a contrast agent for vascular imaging was developed in the 1980s. Currently, CO2  angiography is an alternative agent in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and those who are at risk of developing contrast-induced nephropathy. However, CO2 causes neurotoxicity if the gas inadvertently enters the cerebrovascular circulation leading to fatal brain injury. CASE PRESENTATION: A 71-year-old female with h/o sickle cell trait, hypertension, obesity, metastatic renal cell cancer status post nephrectomy, bone metastasis, chronic kidney disease was admitted for elective embolization of the humerus bone metastasis. Given the high probability of contrast-induced nephropathy, CO2 angiography was chosen for embolization of the metastasis. During the procedure, the patient became unresponsive. Emergent medical management with hyperventilation, 100% fraction oxygen inhalation was performed. Her neuroimaging showed global cerebral edema. An intracranial pressure monitor was placed which confirmed intracranial hypertension. Hyperosmolar therapy was administered with no improvement in clinical examination. She progressed to brain stem herniation. Given poor prognosis, the family opted for comfort measures and the patient expired. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Inadvertent carbon dioxide entry into cerebrovascular circulation during angiography can cause fatal brain injury. Caution must be exercised while performing CO2  angiography in blood vessels above the diaphragm.
32722950	Impact of COVID-19 Infection on 24 Patients with Sickle Cell Disease. One Center Urban Experience, Detroit, MI, USA.	The city of Detroit has a large population of individuals with sickle cell disease, and hospitals in Detroit have seen some of the highest numbers of cases of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) in 2020. The purpose of this study was to examine the pathophysiological characteristics of COVID-19 in patients with sickle cell disease or trait to determine whether these patients have unique manifestations that might require special consideration. This retrospective analysis included 24 patients with confirmed COVID-19 and sickle cell disease or trait who were seen at the Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, MI, USA, between March 1 and April 15 2020. Of the 24 patients, 18 (75.0%) had heterozygous sickle cell trait, one (4.0%) was a double heterozygote for Hb S (HBB: c.20A>T)/beta+-thalassemia (beta+-thal), four had sickle cell anemia (betaS/betaS) and one (4.0%) had Hb S/Hb C (HBB: c.19G>A) disease. A total of 13 (54.0%) patients required hospitalization. All four patients with sickle cell anemia, developed acute pain crisis. We observed one patient who developed acute pulmonary embolism and no patients developed other sickle cell associated complications. Additionally, three (13.0%) patients required packed red blood cell transfusion without the need of exchange transfusion, and one patient required admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), mechanical ventilation and subsequently died. Patients with sickle cell disease or trait and laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 had a generally mild, or unremarkable, course of disease, with lower chances of intubation, ICU admission and death, but with a slightly longer hospitalization.
33690845	Implementation of Individualized Pain Care Plans Decreases Length of Stay and Hospital Admission Rates for High Utilizing Adults with Sickle Cell Disease.	OBJECTIVE: Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) face inconsistent effective analgesic management, leading to high inpatient healthcare utilization and significant financial burden for healthcare institutions. Current evidence does not provide guidance for inpatient management of acute pain in adults with sickle cell disease. We conducted a retrospective analysis of a longitudinal cohort quality improvement project to characterize the role of individualized care plans on improving patient care and reducing financial burden in high healthcare-utilizing patients with SCD-related pain. METHODS: Individualized care plans were developed for patients with hospital admissions resulting from pain associated with sickle cell disease. A 2-year prospective longitudinal cohort quality improvement project was performed and retrospectively analyzed. Primary outcome measure was duration of hospitalization. Secondary outcome measures included: pain intensity; 7, 30, and 90-day readmission rates; cost per day; total admissions; total cost per year; analgesic regimen at index admission; and discharge disposition. RESULTS: Duration of hospitalization, the primary outcome, significantly decreased by 1.23 days with no worsening of pain intensity scores. Seven-day readmission decreased by 34%. Use of intravenous hydromorphone significantly decreased by 25%. The potential cost saving was $1,398,827 as a result of this quality initiative. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of individualized care plans reduced both admission rate and financial burden of high utilizing patients. Importantly, pain outcomes were not diminished. Results suggest that individualized care plans are a promising strategy for managing acute pain crisis in adult sickle cell patients from both care-focused and utilization outcomes.
37696002	Identifying Barriers to HPV Vaccination for Patients With Sickle Cell Disease and Childhood Cancer Survivors.	Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination prevents the development of HPV-associated malignancies. Adolescent and young adult survivors of childhood cancers and patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) are vulnerable patient populations who would significantly benefit from HPV vaccination. In this multimethod study, a retrospective chart review found a notable difference between the rate of HPV vaccinations and other age-appropriate vaccinations in 177 childhood cancer survivors and in 70 patients with SCD. We then sought to describe patient and caregiver beliefs regarding HPV vaccination, through semistructured interviews with 21 patients and 48 caregivers. Interviews were analyzed with a thematic content approach to understand attitudes regarding the HPV vaccination. Qualitative interviews noted that many caregivers and adolescents had baseline misconceptions regarding the HPV vaccination in general and in context with their chronic illness. It was found that a strong recommendation from a trusted subspecialty provider would create reassurance about vaccination and reduce misconceptions and concerns about side effects in the context of a chronic illness. Counseling from subspecialists could have a strong impact on understanding the HPV vaccine in the context of chronic illness. This would likely help overcome many of the barriers to vaccination that are encountered by patients with SCD or oncology survivors.
33241734	Splenectomy in Jamaican children with sickle cell disease: Outcome of selective blood transfusion.	We reviewed the post-operative morbidity and mortality of open splenectomy undertaken in conjunction with selective blood transfusion in Jamaican children with sickle cell disease. Data were collected on 150 splenectomies performed between November 1994 and October 2017. Selective blood transfusion involved raising haemoglobin levels to approximately 100 g/L in patients with admission haemoglobin >=10 g/L below steady state. There was no mortality. Mean post-operative stay was 3.2 days with a median of three days. Total morbidity was 19/150 cases (12.7%), with acute chest syndrome accounting for 11/19 (57.9%). Among the non-transfused, acute chest syndrome occurred in 10/117 cases (8.5%), while among transfused, acute chest syndrome occurred in 1/33 cases (2.9%). We recommend this selective blood transfusion protocol for patients with sickle cell disease to surgeons who undertake splenectomies in settings where blood bank reserves are perennially low.
34327799	The health literacy disparity in adolescents with sickle cell disease.	PURPOSE: There are over 100,000 individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD) in the United States, most of whom are Black, poor, and publically insured. In combination with a chronic illness, these demographics lead to significant barriers to healthcare for patients with SCD, leaving them exceptionally vulnerable within the healthcare system. This unique vulnerability is especially notable when transitioning adolescents with SCD from pediatric to adult care, as this is a significant time of morbidity and mortality for these patients. It is postulated that health literacy influences transition from pediatric to adult care in adolescents with SCD. To better understand this relationship, more adolescent health literacy research must be conducted with both adolescents with and without SCD. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to systematically compare health literacy in adolescents with and without SCD. DESIGN AND METHODS: This is a cross-sectional, descriptive, exploratory study. One hundred and thirty-four adolescents with SCD and 105 adolescents without SCD were recruited for this study. The Newest Vital Sign (NVS) health literacy instrument was used to evaluate health literacy. Pearson correlations were conducted to evaluate relationships among health literacy and the influencing factors of age, grade level, income, and parental education level. Differences in NVS scores between groups were assessed using independent samples t tests. RESULTS: There was a significant relationship between health literacy, age (r = .286, p < .01) and grade level (r = .317, p = .00) in adolescents with SCD. In adolescents without SCD, there was a significant relationship between health literacy, income (r = .235; p < .05) and parental education (r = .263; p < .01). The mean NVS score was 2.66 for adolescents with SCD and 3.77 for adolescents without SCD. A statistically significant difference in NVS scores was found between groups (t = 4.772; p < .001). Adolescents with SCD demonstrated significantly lower NVS scores than adolescents without SCD. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: There are significant differences in health literacy scores and influencing factors in adolescents with and without SCD. Thus, this article provides unique insight for nurses as they design, implement and evaluate health promotion, patient education, and future research initiatives for adolescents and families, both with and without SCD. Further research is needed to gain more insight into this phenomenon.
32314798	COVID-19 infection in patients with sickle cell disease.	
34487854	[Erythrapheresis in children with sickle cell disease, experience of a paediatric apheresis unit].	Erythrocyte exchanges on cell separators can be used in children with sickle cell disease and are effective in lowering the level of haemoglobin S. Of the 938 aphereses performed in 2020 in our unit, we observed a low rate of failure of procedures and few complications. Ninety-six percent of erythraphereses were performed in the context of chronic exchange programs, in more than 80% of cases for cerebral vasculopathy or after the occurrence of ischemic strokes. Less than 4% of the procedures were performed for specific indications (preparation for cholecystectomy most often). The vascular access is rarely an obstacle to the realisation of the apheresis. In case of insufficient venous capital, installing an arteriovenous fistula may be considered. Depending on the child's weight, haemoglobin level, and the severity of the sickle cell anaemia, precautions may be necessary when priming the procedure. Nurses experienced in paediatric apheresis and a good medical knowledge of sickle cell disease allowed us to use this technique from the age of 3years and the weight of 15kg.

32976551	Effect of hydroxyurea exposure before puberty on sperm parameters in males with sickle cell disease.	Sperm parameters are known to be impaired in men with sickle cell disease (SCD). Although treatment with hydroxyurea (HU) has an impact on sperm quality, sperm preservation is impossible before puberty. This study's primary objective was to analyze and compare sperm parameters in male patients with SCD exposed (or not) to HU before puberty. Twenty-six sperm samples from 15 patients (median age, 17 years; range, 16-23) treated with HU during childhood were compared with 46 samples from 23 HU-naive patients (20 years; 16-24). The median age at HU initiation was 6 years (1-14 years), the median duration of HU treatment was 4 years (0.5-10), and the mean dose of HU was 22.4 +- 3.7 mg/kg per day. Although we observed substantial quantitative and qualitative semen abnormalities in all patients, there were no significant differences in semen volume, sperm concentration, total sperm count, or spermatozoa motility, morphology, and vitality between the HU-exposed and HU-naive groups. At the time of the semen analysis, 100% of the patients in the HU-exposed group and 52% of the patients in the HU-naive group received transfusion therapy. The specific effect of HU on spermatogenesis in very young infants and the putative value of transfusion for reversing the toxicity of HU warrant further investigation.
35535578	Vaccination in Pediatric Patients with Sickle-Cell Disease: Uptake Report and Mini-Review.	BACKGROUND: Brazil has one of the highest numbers of births with sickle-cell disease (SCD) in the Americas. Despite the risk of severe illnesses and death due to both vaccine-preventable infections, vaccination uptake in pediatric patients with SCD is unknown. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Children under 18 years with SCD presenting to routine medical consultations had their vaccination status evaluated according to the national recommendations. Data obtained were classified as 'Adequate', 'Delayed' or 'Missing' vaccination and compared among age groups. RESULTS: From 117 children screened, 100 had their vaccination card available. Vaccination coverage of routine vaccines was above 95% for all primary series and both age groups, with varied rates of delays and low missing doses. Among SCD extended vaccination, the most frequently delayed and missed vaccines were those specifically recommended to individuals with SCD as per national guidelines-and particularly those against encapsulated bacteria. Significant and varied rates of missing doses occurred in primary series and booster doses for PPSV23, Hib, menC, hepatitis A and varicella. The average influenza vaccination rate was 69.5%, with higher rates among younger children. CONCLUSIONS: Children with SCD have alarming under-vaccination rates. Basic prevention strategies in Brazil should be reassessed in this specific population.

35285420	Correlates of transfusion transmissible infections among patients with sickle cell disease in Nigeria: case-control study.	Transfusion transmissible infections (TTIs) such as Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) are among the most frequent complications in individuals with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD). We investigated factors associated with TTIs in SCD patients and controls in South-west Nigeria. A total of 2,034 participants with or without SCD were recruited in a matched case-control study. HIV, HBV and HCV infections were diagnosed using commercialy available ELISA kits (Biorad, Paris). Samples positive for HIV ELISA were further confirmed using Western blot. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, paired/independent t-test and logistic regression at p = .05. Proportion with HBV was higher among those with multiple sexual partners (12.7%), tattoo/body incision (11.8%), and sharing of sharp objects (7.3%), but HIV was only higher among participants with history of tattoo/body incision (1.5%). Prevalence of TTIs was similar among participants with or without transfusion. History of sharing sharp objects (adjusted odds ratios (aOR) = 1.72; 95%CI:1.11-2.66) and tattoo/body incision (aOR = 1.89; 95%CI:1.22-2.94) almost doubled the risk of HBV. TTIs are endemic in the studied area. Certain lifestyles predispose people to TTIs than having blood transfusion. Population-based intervention targeting lifestyle changes may reduce the risk of TTIs in the study area.Abbrveviations AA: Hemoglobin AA; AC: Hemoglobin AC; aOR: adjusted Odds Ratios; AS: Hemoglobin AS; CHOP: Children Outpatient; CI: Confidence Interval; EDTA: Ethylenediamine Tetraacetic Acid; GOP: General Outpatient; HBV: Hepatitis B Virus; HCV: Hepatitis C Virus; HIV: Human Immunodeficiency Virus; HPLC: High Performance Liquid Chromatography; IAMRAT: Advanced Medical Research & Training; IDU: Injection Drug Use; MOP: Medical Outpatient; SC: Hemoglobin SC; SCD: Sickle cell disease; SD: Standard Deviation; SF: Hemoglobin SF; SS: Hemoglobin SS; STDs: Sexually Transmitted Diseases; TTI: Transfusion transmissible infections; UCH: University College Hospital Ibadan; UI: University of Ibadan.
35724398	COVID19 vaccination in adults with sickle cell disease is not associated with increases in rates of pain crisis.	ABSTRACTPeople with sickle cell disease (SCD) are more vulnerable to hospitalization, pneumonia, and pain following COVID-19 infection. However, given the association between the inflammatory response and vaso-occlusive crises in SCD and a case report of vaso-occlusive crises following administration of the ChAdOx1 nCov-195-7/AstraZeneca vaccine, there is concern that the administration of COVID-19 vaccines in people with SCD might provoke a vaso-occlusive crisis. To address this critical gap in knowledge, we sought to examine acute care usage for vaso-occlusive crisis and frequency and severity of side effects following COVID-19 vaccination among patients at the Montefiore Sickle Cell Center for Adults. As part of regular care, patients were asked if they had received COVID-19 vaccination and any side effects were noted. Electronic medical records were reviewed for the type of vaccine, dates received, episodes of vaso-occlusive crises within seven days of a dose, and side effects noted. The risk of average hospital utilization per week in 2019 was calculated as a baseline. We found that fewer than 1 in 10 patients presented to the hospital within seven days of vaccination and that the risk of hospital utilization was similar to the average risk in a week in 2019. Of patients who reported side effects, one reported a possible case of sensorineural hearing loss otherwise no other rare side effects, including thrombosis or death, were reported.
36628629	How do we operate a large monthly red blood cell exchange program.	BACKGROUND: Red blood cell (RBC) exchange for sickle cell disease presents unique difficulties due to RBC phenotyping, complex antibody work-ups, large number of RBC units required, and vascular access considerations, any of which can delay the procedure. Multidisciplinary coordination and systemic processes ensure that monthly appointments remain on schedule. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A high-volume chronic RBC exchange program is described, highlighting the importance of multidisciplinary coordination and process improvement strategies involving initial referral, vascular access, order sets, and allocation of antigen-negative or phenotypically matched RBCs. RESULTS: Approximately 50 outpatient RBC exchanges are performed each month with an 82% kept-appointment rate. Specific factors for program success include open communication across services and improvements to referrals and standardized order sets. CONCLUSION: A combination of multidisciplinary coordination and process improvement can ensure the success of a high volume RBC exchange program. Frequent communication of upcoming appointments between the referring hematologists, the hemapheresis clinic, transfusion service, and interventional radiology is critical. Advance notice to the immunohematology reference lab of upcoming appointments is needed to allow enough time for allocating antigen-negative RBCs. Order sets can be leveraged to standardize and streamline RBC exchanges. Lastly, numerous mechanisms help patients compensate for the cognitive sequelae of stroke.
35708432	Uptake and usage of proguanil as malaria chemoprophylaxis and the socio-economic determinants of proguanil usage in children with sickle cell anemia in Benin City.	Background: Proguanil is currently the recommended drug used for malaria chemoprophylaxis in children with Sickle cell anaemia (SCA). Aims: This study aims to determine the uptake and usage of proguanil as malaria chemoprophylaxis and the socioeconomic determinants of its usage in children aged 6-59 months. This was a descriptive cross-sectional study carried out in two major sickle cell clinics in Benin City, Edo state, Nigeria. A total of 420 participants were interviewed using semistructured questionnaires. Patients and Methods: Descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate analysis of quantitative data were done using SPSS version 21. Results: The uptake of proguanil among study participants was 67.4%; of these number, 268 (94.7%) reported daily use of proguanil. Only 3 (0.7%) used pyrimethamine as chemoprophylaxis, while 134 (31.9%) used no form of malaria chemoprophylaxis. Having mothers with higher level of education (LOE) (P = 0.013, odds ratio [OR] = 1.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.15-3.17), attending clinic at the University of Benin Teaching Hospital (UBTH) (P = 0.044, OR = 2.15, 95% CI = 1.02-4.54), older age group (36-59 months) (P = 0.015, OR = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.11-2.51), and owning insecticide-treated net (ITN) (P = 0.000, OR = 3.11, 95% CI = 1.98-4.88) were significant positive predictors for the usage of proguanil. Conclusion: Proguanil uptake was low. Attending sickle-cell clinic at UBTH, having mothers with tertiary LOE, and owning ITN were social factors associated with high usage of proguanil amongst children with SCA. Continuous monitoring and evaluation of the uptake and usage of proguanil in children is important, so as to aid policy implementation and review.
32520675	Advances in Sickle Cell Disease Treatments.	Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is an inherited disorder of red blood cells that is caused by a single mutation in the beta -globin gene. The disease, which afflicts millions of patients worldwide mainly in low income countries, is characterized by high morbidity, mortality and low life expectancy. The new pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies for SCD is urgent in order to promote treatments able to reduce patient's suffering and improve their quality of life. Since the FDA approval of HU in 1998, there have been few advances in discovering new drugs; however, in the last three years voxelotor, crizanlizumab, and glutamine have been approved as new therapeutic alternatives. In addition, new promising compounds have been described to treat the main SCD symptoms. Herein, focusing on drug discovery, we discuss new strategies to treat SCD that have been carried out in the last ten years to discover new, safe, and effective treatments. Moreover, non-pharmacological approaches, including red blood cell exchange, gene therapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation will be presented.
32437728	Immune mechanisms involved in sickle cell disease pathogenesis: current knowledge and perspectives.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is caused by a single point mutation in the beta-chain of the hemoglobin gene that results in the replacement of glutamic acid with valine in the hemoglobin protein. However, recent studies have demonstrated that alterations in several other genes, especially immune related genes, may be associated with complications of SCD. In fact, higher chronic inflammatory status is related to more severe clinical symptoms in SCD patients, suggesting crucial roles of the immune system in SCD physiopathology. Nevertheless, although participation of innate immune cells in SCD pathogenesis has been broadly and extensively described, little is known about the roles of the adaptive immune system in this disease. In addition, the influence of treatments on the immune system of SCD patients and their complications (such as alloimmunization) are not yet completely understood. Thus, we reviewed the current knowledge about the immune mechanisms involved in SCD pathogenesis. We suggest recommendations for future studies to allow for a broader understanding of SCD pathogenesis, helping in the development of new therapies and improvement in the life quality and expectancy of patients.
32540577	Liver Transplantation in Patients with Sickle Cell Disease in the United States.	BACKGROUND: Up to 30% of patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) develop chronic liver disease via etiologies including sickle cell hepatopathy, acquired viral hepatitis, or secondary hemochromatosis. It is unclear how many patients with SCD ultimately undergo liver transplantation (LT) and what factors are associated with survival after LT. In this study, we examined LT outcomes in these patients by reviewing the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR) and our institutional experience. METHODS: Analysis of the SRTR identified 23 LT recipients and five simultaneous liver and kidney transplantation (SLKT) recipients with SCD. Patient demographics and graft and patient survival were analyzed. Two patients with SCD at our institution underwent SLKT. RESULTS: Review of the SRTR revealed that recipients with SCD had significantly higher model for end-stage liver disease scores (33 versus 21, P = 0.004), preoperative intensive care unit admission (43.5% versus 19.1%, P = 0.007), preoperative dialysis (17.4% versus 4.9%, P = 0.009), and were more likely to be status 1 (26.1% versus 12.1%, P = 0.041) when compared with the reference population of African American LT recipients. Despite being higher risk at the time of LT, patients with SCD had equivalent posttransplant graft and patient survival when compared with the reference population (P = 0.5 and P = 0.2, respectively) and a 2:1 propensity score-matched group (P = 0.5 and P = 0.2, respectively). Two recent SLKT recipients with SCD from our institution have performed well with stable allograft function. CONCLUSIONS: Data from the SRTR demonstrate that patients with SCD can expect equivalent graft and patient survival after LT despite exhibiting more comorbidities at the time of LT. The low number of patients with SCD who underwent LT in the SRTR in comparison with the rate of chronic liver disease in this population raises the question as to whether a disparity in access to LT exists for this complex population.
31674662	Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I antibodies and transfusion support in paediatric HLA-matched haematopoietic cell transplant for sickle cell disease.	The relevance of donor-specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibodies in HLA-mismatched haematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) is known, but the importance of HLA antibodies in HLA-matched HCT is unclear. We hypothesized that HLA antibodies detected before HCT would cause platelet transfusion refractoriness during HCT and investigated this in a multi-centre study. Pre-HCT samples from 45 paediatric patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) undergoing HLA-matched HCT were tested for HLA class I antibodies. The number of platelet transfusions received before day +45 was compared between those with and without antibodies. Thirteen of 45 (29%) patients had a positive HLA class I antibody screen, and these patients received significantly more platelet transfusions than patients without antibodies (median 19 vs. 7 5, P = 0 028). This platelet transfusion association remained significant when controlling for conditioning regimen. Among alloimmunized patients, there was no association between the panel-reactive antibody and the number of platelet transfusions. Patients with HLA class I antibodies also had a higher incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD): 6/13 (46%) vs. 3/32 (9%), P = 0 011. Pre-HCT HLA class I alloimmunization is associated with increased platelet transfusion support and acute GVHD in paediatric HLA-matched HCT for SCD. Further studies are needed to investigate the pathobiology of this association.
36535408	Fetal allotransplant recipients are resistant to graft-versus-host disease.	In utero hematopoietic cell transplantation (IUHCT) is an experimental treatment for congenital hemoglobinopathies, including Sickle cell disease and thalassemias. One of the principal advantages of IUHCT is the predisposition of the developing fetus toward immunologic tolerance. This allows for engraftment across immune barriers without immunosuppression and, potentially, decreased susceptibility to graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). We demonstrate fetal resistance to GVHD following T cell-replete allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation compared with the neonate. We show that this resistance is associated with elevated fetal serum interleukin-10 conducive to the induction of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Finally, we demonstrate that the adoptive transfer of Tregs from IUHCT recipients to neonates uniformly prevents GVHD, recapitulating the predisposition to tolerance observed after fetal allotransplantation. These findings demonstrate fetal resistance to GVHD following hematopoietic cell transplantation and elucidate Tregs as important contributors.
37205803	Current Evidence and Rationale to Guide Perioperative Management, Including Transfusion Decisions, in Patients With Sickle Cell Disease.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a collection of inherited hemoglobin disorders that results in chronic hemolytic anemia, vaso-occlusion, pain, and end organ damage. Surgery in the SCD population requires careful planning, as perioperative stressors can lead to increased sickling and risk of inducing or further exacerbating vaso-occlusive episodes (VOEs). Additionally, the underlying hypercoagulability and immunocompromised state due to SCD places patients at increased risk of both venous thromboembolism and infection. Judicious fluid administration, temperature regulation, thorough preoperative and postoperative analgesic planning, and preoperative transfusion are all crucial components of decreasing risks of surgery in patients with SCD.
37541536	Chronic Pain Management in Sickle Cell Disease: A Systematic Scoping Review of Controlled Trials.	Existing treatment for chronic pain in sickle cell disease (SCD) is opioid-dependent, which is ineffective and carries risks. We conducted a scoping literature review to assess the size and scope of available literature about controlled trials of therapies for SCD chronic pain and identify research gaps. The search strategy in PubMed and EMBASE utilized keywords for chronic pain and sickle cell and identified seven original articles that met inclusion criteria. Six of the studies recruited from clinics while one recruited from community sources. Cannabis and behavioral modification were associated with improvements in pain scores. However, existing evidence does not represent best practices for assessing chronic pain, and this along with small sample sizes prevents translation to clinical care. The limited evidence concerning treatment for SCD chronic pain highlights the need for larger trials of opioid alternatives and the utilization of chronic pain measures that capture nociplastic pain in SCD.
36400536	Chronic Pain: Prevalence and Management.	Chronic pain is a distinct complication that profoundly affects the lives of individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD). Chronic SCD pain emerges with increasing age and is very prevalent in adults. The pathophysiology of chronic SCD pain is likely distinct from acute SCD pain and therefore needs a different treatment approach. Clinical trials evaluating the treatment of chronic SCD pain are lacking and treatment currently relies on evidence from other chronic pain conditions. Continued investigations into the underlying causes of chronic SCD pain are needed, and clinical trials focused on chronic pain therapy are imperative.
36782408	Malposition of the central venous catheter secondary to accessory hemiazygos vein variant.	A 36-year-old female with sickle cell disease presented with sickle cell pain crisis. After failure to establish peripheral venous access, an internal jugular central venous catheter (CVC) was placed. Confirmation of internal jugular cannulation was performed with bedside ultrasound. A confirmatory chest X-ray revealed an unusual position of the catheter, taking a course inferiorly, making a loop and remaining on the left side of the mediastinum. A lateral view was done and revealed that the catheter passed inferiorly through the internal jugular vein then posteriorly and inferiorly giving the looped appearance. This is better delineated on a sagittal view CT scan showing the tip of the catheter terminating in the accessory hemiazygos vein. This unusual course is due to a variant of the accessory hemiazygos vein which is connected to the left superior intercostal vein. This creates a lower resistance pathway for the CVC which passes from the internal jugular vein, down the left superior intercostal vein (instead of the left brachiocephalic vein) and into the accessory hemiazygos vein. Discussion: The correct tip placement of an internal jugular CVC terminates in the superior vena cava just above the cardiac silhouette. In 1%-2% of individuals, a connection between the accessory hemiazygos and the left superior intercostal vein is present. Rare cases are discovered incidentally during CVC placement. The diameter of the accessory hemiazygos vein is less than half of that of the superior vena cava. The catheter should not be used as central venous access and removal is recommended. Malpositioning of central catheters is unpredictable but can be easily avoided by using intraprocedural methods to confirm tip position. Such modalities include intracavitary ECG or ultrasound with agitated saline injection as described in the SIC (Safe Insertion of Centrally Inserted Central Catheters) protocol.
33550421	Tolerance and humoral immune response to the yellow fever vaccine in sickle cell disease children treated with hydroxyurea: a multicentre prospective study.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) children are frequent travellers to countries where yellow fever (YF) is endemic, but there are no data regarding the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine in such children treated with hydroxyurea (HU). The main objective of this study was to compare the tolerance and immune response to YF vaccination in SCD children treated or not with HU. METHOD: SCD children < 18 years attending the international travel clinics of three large paediatric centres and requiring a first YF vaccination were included in a prospective study. Adverse events were collected 2 weeks after vaccination. YF vaccine antibody titres were measured ~6 months after vaccination. RESULTS: Among the 52 SCD children vaccinated against YF, 17 (33%) were treated with HU. Only mild adverse events, mainly fever and local reaction, were observed in the HU group with a similar frequency in the non-HU group (57 and 35%, respectively, P = 0.30). YF antibody titres were measured in 15/17 patients in the HU group and 23/35 patients in the non-HU group after a median of 6.0 months (3.5-8.5) following vaccination. The geometric mean of YF antibody titre was similar in both groups. A protective antibody level was observed in 85% of the children in the HU group vs 100% in the non-HU group (P = 0.14), suggesting a lower effectiveness of the vaccine in patients on HU similarly to what has been described in patients on immune suppressive therapy for other vaccines. CONCLUSION: YF vaccination seems to be safe and efficient in SCD children treated with HU. Considering the potential risk of severe complications in cases of YF while travelling in Africa for those patients, the benefit-to-risk ratio argues for YF vaccination in all SCD children. Control of a protective antibody titre may also be useful to ascertain an adequate response in those treated with HU.
32980556	COVID-19 and sickle cell disease in Bahrain.	INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a newly identified strain of the coronavirus family that has been shown to affect the hemoglobin beta chain, the same chain that has sickle cell disease (SCD) mutation. This study was undertaken to see if COVID-19 infection increased disease severity in patients with SCD. METHODS: Mass screening of the Bahraini population was undertaken between February and April 2020. RESULTS: A total of 38,092 Bahraini people were tested for COVID-19 during this period; 378 (1%) were SCD patients. Six patients with SCD had COVID-19 (1.6%): three remained asymptomatic, two had mild symptoms and one required oxygen therapy. The SCD patients had a similar average length of stay when compared with non-SCD COVID-19 patients (10.7 days). CONCLUSION: The infection rate, clinical course and viral clearance seen for the SCD patients with COVID-19 were no different to those without SCD.
38587343	[Population characterization of mutations for sickle cell anemia and its treatment: One step towards personalized medicine for the disease].	Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is the most common genetic disease worldwide. There are countries with massive public health programs for early detection of this condition. In the literature, several specific haplotypes or single-base polymorphic variants (SNPs) have been associated with the SCA prognosis. OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the significant correlation of SNPs relevant to the diagnosis and prognosis of SCA among different ethnic groups. METHODOLOGY: we analyzed population frequencies and correlations of several SNPs related to the prognosis of SCA (i.e., baseline fetal hemoglobin levels), response to hydroxyurea treatment, and response to other drugs used in the SCA treatment, collected from validated genomic databases among different ethnic groups. RESULTS: The calculation of the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and the logistic regression was successful in classifying the ethnic groups as African (0 = 0.78, 1 = 0.89), and with a lower efficiency as American (AMR) (0 = 0.88, 1 = 0.00), East Asian (EAS) (0 = 0.80, 1 = 0.00), European (EUR) (0 = 0.79, 1 = 0.00), and South Asian (SAS) (0 = 0.80, 1 = 0.00). CONCLUSIONS: The results extend those from previous reports and show that the profile of most of the SNPs studied presented statistically significant distributions among general ethnic groups, pointing to the need to carry out massive early screening of relevant SNPs for SCA in patients diagnosed with this disease. It is concluded that the application of a broad mutation detection program will lead to a more personalized and efficient response in the treatment of SCA.
32663844	Marijuana use and health behaviors in a US clinic sample of patients with sickle cell disease.	INTRODUCTION: As marijuana use becomes more common, it is essential clinicians understand the relationship between marijuana use and health behaviors. METHODS: Using a retrospective cohort of adolescents and adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) stratified into a young (<25 years) and older cohort (> = 25 years), we conducted multiple linear regression examining relationship of marijuana use (independent variable) on each dependent variable (SCD self-management score and pain management). RESULTS: Among young cohort, 16.9% used marijuana compared to 21.8% of older cohort. The younger cohort reporting marijuana use had lower mean self-care scores (beta = -2.74;p = 0.009) and were more likely to have admissions to the hospital for pain (beta = 0.87;p = 0.047) compared to non-users. In contrast, the older cohort reporting marijuana use had more days treating pain at home (beta = 0.44;p = 0.035). CONCLUSIONS: Only a minority of patients with SCD reported lifetime marijuana use. Among those reporting marijuana use, there were different associations with self-care and health-related behaviors by age. The older cohort who endorsed marijuana use reported more days of treating pain at home, although this did not translate into increased acute care visits for pain crisis. Among youth, endorsing marijuana use was associated with worse SCD self-care.
34956203	Long-Term Effects of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation on Systemic Inflammation in Sickle Cell Disease Patients.	Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is the only currently available curative treatment for sickle cell disease (SCD). However, the effects of HSCT on SCD pathophysiology are poorly elucidated. Here, we assessed red blood cell (RBC) adhesiveness, intensity of hemolysis, vascular tone markers and systemic inflammation, in SCD patients treated with allogeneic HSCT. Thirty-two SCD patients were evaluated before and on long-term follow-up after HSCT. Overall survival was 94% with no severe (grade III-IV) graft-vs-host disease and a 22% rejection rate (graft failure). Hematological parameters, reticulocyte counts, and levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), endothelin-1 and VCAM-1 normalized in SCD patients post-HSCT. Expression of adhesion molecules on reticulocytes and RBC was lower in patients with sustained engraftment. Levels of IL-18, IL-15 and LDH were higher in patients that developed graft failure. Increased levels of plasma pro-inflammatory cytokines, mainly TNF-alpha, were found in SCD patients long-term after transplantation. SCD patients with sustained engraftment after allo-HSCT showed decreased reticulocyte counts and adhesiveness, diminished hemolysis, and lower levels of vascular tonus markers. Nevertheless, systemic inflammation persists for at least five years after transplantation, indicating that allo-HSCT does not equally affect all aspects of SCD pathophysiology.
33128443	Emergence of gram-negative organisms as the cause of infections in patients with sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Patients with sickle cell disease are at higher risk of infections with encapsulated bacteria due to immature immune responses and functional asplenia. We aimed to study our patient population for the emergence of gram-negative organisms other than Salmonella as the cause of osteomyelitis and document a vast decrease in Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteremia rates. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of 158 patients with sickle cell disease registered at our hospital. Over a period of 13 years, every patient presenting to the emergency department (ED) with fever had their medical record reviewed for blood cultures, wound cultures, and magnetic resonance imaging results for osteomyelitis. RESULTS: The number of patients presenting to the ED with fever was 105, with 581 febrile episodes and 893 blood cultures. Among those, no culture grew Streptococcus pneumoniae, 14 grew coagulase-negative staphylococci (1.5%), one grew Salmonella enterica Paratyphi B, and three grew Salmonella enterica group C (in the same patient). The total number of osteomyelitis episodes in patients with sickle cell disease presenting with fever and documented by imaging was nine (1.5%). In patients with osteomyelitis, organisms were isolated in four patients (44%), including Enterobacter cloacae, Bacteroides, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella enterica group C. CONCLUSIONS: Immunization against Streptococcus pneumoniae and the use of prophylactic penicillin has virtually eliminated pneumococcal bacteremia among our patients. We observed the emergence of gram-negative organisms other than Salmonella as the cause of osteomyelitis in patients with sickle cell disease.
36210501	An Overview of Solid Organ Transplantation in Patients With Sickle Cell Disease.	Sickle cell disease is a common genetic disorder affecting >300 000 people across the world. The vast majority of patients cared for in high-resource settings live well into adulthood, but many develop a high burden of disease complications. Good standard of care including disease-modifying agents and transfusion programs limits the number of patients who develop end-stage organ disease, but for those that do, the prognosis can be very poor. Solid organ transplantation is a well-established mode of treatment for patients with sickle cell disease and kidney or liver failure, but appropriate patient selection and perioperative management are important for achieving good outcomes. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and gene therapy may offer novel treatment options for adult patients with chronic organ damage in the future, but these are not yet widely available. For now, good, holistic care and early intervention of end-organ complications can minimize the number of patients requiring solid organ transplantation later in life.
37573345	Impact and burden of sickle cell disease in critically ill obstetric patients in a high dependency unit in Sierra Leone-a registry based evaluation.	INTRODUCTION: Sickle cell disease (SCD) in pregnancy is associated with worse maternal and neonatal outcomes. There is limited available data describing the burden and outcomes of critically ill obstetric patients affected by SCD in low-income settings. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to define SCD burden and impact on mortality in critically-ill obstetric patients admitted to an urban referral hospital in Sierra Leone. We hypothesized that SCD burden is high and independently associated with increased mortality. METHODS: We performed a registry-based cross-sectional study from March 2020 to December 2021 in the high-dependency unit (HDU) of Princess Christian Maternity Hospital PCMH, Freetown. Primary endpoints were the proportion of patients identified in the SCD group and HDU mortality. Secondary endpoints included frequency of maternal direct obstetric complications (MDOCs) and the maternal early obstetric warning score (MEOWS). RESULTS: Out of a total of 497 patients, 25 (5.5%) qualified to be included in the SCD group. MEOWS on admission was not different between patients with and without SCD and SCD patients had also less frequently reported MDOCs. Yet, crude HDU mortality in the SCD group was 36%, compared to 9.5% in the non SCD group (P < 0.01), with an independent association between SCD group exposure and mortality when accounting for severity on admission (hazard ratio 3.40; 95%CI 1.57-7.39; P = 0.002). Patients with SCD had a tendency to longer HDU length of stay. CONCLUSIONS: One out of twenty patients accessing a HDU in Sierra Leone fulfilled criteria for SCD. Despite comparable severity on admission, mortality in SCD patients was four times higher than patients without SCD. Optimization of intermediate and intensive care for this group of patients should be prioritized in low-resource settings with high maternal mortality.
36123234	Editing human hematopoietic stem cells: advances and challenges.	Genome editing of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells is being developed for the treatment of several inherited disorders of the hematopoietic system. The adaptation of CRISPR-Cas9-based technologies to make precise changes to the genome, and developments in altering the specificity and efficiency, and improving the delivery of nucleases to target cells have led to several breakthroughs. Many clinical trials are ongoing, and several pre-clinical models have been reported that would allow these genetic therapies to one day offer a potential cure to patients with diseases where limited options currently exist. However, there remain several challenges with respect to establishing safety, expanding accessibility and improving the manufacturing processes of these therapeutic products. This review focuses on some of the recent advances in the field of genome editing of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and illustrates the ongoing challenges.
38130071	Reevaluation of the medical necessity of washed red blood cell transfusion in chronically transfused adults.	BACKGROUND: Washing red blood cell (RBC) units mitigates severe allergic transfusion reactions. However, washing reduces the time to expiration and the effective dose. Automated washing is time- and labor-intensive. A shortage of cell processor tubing sets prompted review of medical necessity for washed RBC for patients previously thought to require washing. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A single-center, retrospective study investigated discontinuing wash RBC protocols in chronically transfused adults. In select patients with prior requirements for washing, due to a history of allergic transfusion reactions, trials of unwashed transfusions were performed. Patient demographic, clinical, laboratory, and transfusion data were compiled. The per-unit washing cost was the sum of the tubing set, saline, and technical labor costs. RESULTS: Fifteen patients (median age 34 years interquartile range [IQR] 23-53 years, 46.7% female) were evaluated. These patients had been transfused with a median of 531 washed RBC units (IQR 244-1066) per patient over 12 years (IQR 5-18 years), most commonly for recurrent, non-severe allergic reactions. There were no transfusion reactions with unwashed RBCs aside from one patient with one episode of pruritus and another with recurrent pruritus, which was typical even with washed RBC. We decreased the mean number of washed RBC units per month by 72.9% (104 +- 10 vs. 28.2 +- 25.2; p < .0001) and saved US $100.25 per RBC unit. CONCLUSION: Washing of RBCs may be safely reconsidered in chronically transfused patients without a history of anaphylaxis. Washing should be implemented judiciously due to potential lack of necessity and logistical/operational challenges.
33753141	Morinda lucida Benth (Rubiaceae): A review of its ethnomedicine, phytochemistry and pharmacology.	ETHNOMEDICINAL RELEVANCE: Natural products derived from plants have served the primary healthcare needs of millions of indigenous people for centuries, many of which have been documented and scientifically validated. Morinda lucida Benth (Rubiaceae), also referred to as brimstone tree, is an ethnomedicinal plant which has been widely used in traditional medicine for several decades, particularly in the African continent. Various parts of the plant, including stem bark, leaves and root, have been applied in traditional medicine for the management of various pathological conditions such as malaria, diabetes, hypertension, inflammation, typhoid fever, cancer, cognitive disorders, sickle cell disease, trypanosomiasis, onchocerciasis and various fevers. In this review, we critically evaluated the relationship between traditional uses, laboratory pharmacological activities and clinical studies on M. lucida so as to unveil opportunities for the development of relevant therapeutic agents against diseases that threaten mankind. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A search for relevant data on M. lucida was done using scientific databases (Google Scholar, Mendeley, ScienceDirect, PubMed, Asian Science Citation Database, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Scientific Journal Database, Chinese Science Citation Database, other web sources (such as The Plant List and PROTA), books and other literature sources. RESULTS: A hundred compounds have been isolated from M. lucida. Many of the reported secondary metabolites include alkaloids, tannins, anthraquinones, sterols, saponins, polyphenols, terpenoids, phenols and cardiac glycosides. The in vitro and in vivo experimental studies on various extracts, fractions and isolated compounds of M. lucida support the acclaimed pharmacological activities of the plant, such as antimalarial, antidiabetic, hypotensive, anti-inflammatory, immunostimulatory, antioxidant, antimicrobial, antiproliferative, cognitive-enhancement, anti-sickling, anti-trypanosomal, anti-onchocercal, muscle relaxant, antifungal and anti-leishmanial activities. These evidence-based scientific reports lend credence to their traditional uses. However, the safety of extracts of M. lucida is a cause for concern following reported toxicities such as antispermatogenic effect, genotoxicity and in vitro inhibition of human cytochrome P450 3A subfamily. CONCLUSION: Documented evidence suggests that M. lucida remains a rich source of extracts and chemical compounds with diverse bioactivities that are of therapeutic benefit to man and this justifies its traditional uses for the primary healthcare needs of indigenous populations across tropical Africa. Due to the fact that M. lucida extracts may not be safe at some reported doses, more in-depth studies on their toxicities are required to better understand safer approaches to their traditional uses. In addition, mechanistic studies on the isolated compounds with known pharmacological activities are quite limited, thus necessitating future research efforts to be focused on the mechanisms of action of these active principles in order to facilitate their potential enlistment for rational drug design.
35841199	Sickle cell trait results in a high leukoreduction quality control failure rate for whole blood donations.	BACKGROUND: Prior studies have shown that sickle cell trait (SCT) is the most common reason attributed to leukoreduction (LR) filter failure due to physical blockage. However, current Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines do not require blood collectors to take a specific action to mitigate inadequate LR that may occur among donors with SCT. We sought to determine the scope of inadequate LR among whole blood (WB) donations collected from individuals with SCT and processed under standard manufacturing conditions. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Between 8/2021 and 2/2022, a total of 40 red blood cells units (RBCs) manufactured from WB donations collected from donors historically positive for SCT had residual leukocyte testing performed. All 40 of the units had appeared to successfully complete leukofiltration. RESULTS: Out of the 40 units tested, 22 failed routine residual leukocyte quality control testing (55% failure rate, 95% confidence interval 40%-70%). Nine out of the 22 failures resulted in more than 100 residual leukocytes per microliter of product. CONCLUSION: Even when leukofiltration appears to have been completed successfully, WB units collected from donors with SCT have a high (55% in aggregate) rate of inadequate leukoreduction. Correlating this result with previous studies showing that of up to 50% of WB units collected from donors with SCT fail to pass through the leukoreduction filter, we estimate that only 25% of WB donations collected from individuals with SCT will result in a leukoreduced RBC unit that meets all FDA requirements. Blood centers should encourage individuals with SCT to donate platelets or plasma, rather than WB.
32124977	Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) for pain management in sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD), one of the most common inherited disorders, is associated with vaso-occlusive pain episodes and haemolysis leading to recurrent morbidity, hospital admissions and work or school absenteeism. The crises are conventionally treated with opioids, non-opioids and other adjuvants with the risk of developing complications, addictions and drug-seeking behaviour. Different non-pharmacological treatments, such as transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) have been used for managing pain in other painful conditions. Hence, the efficacy of TENS for managing pain in SCD needs to be reviewed. OBJECTIVES: To assess the benefits and harms of TENS for managing pain in people with SCD who experience pain crises or chronic pain (or both). SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Register, comprising of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We also searched online trial registries and the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Date of the last search: 26 Febraury 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs, where TENS was evaluated for managing pain in people with SCD. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of the trials identified by the literature searches according to the inclusion criteria. Two review authors then independently extracted data, assessed for risk of bias using the Cochrane standard tool and rated the quality of evidence using the GRADE guidelines. MAIN RESULTS: One double-blind cross-over RCT with 22 participants with SCD (aged 12 to 27 years) was eligible for inclusion. Following stratification into four pain crises severity grades, participants were then randomised to receive TENS or placebo (sham TENS). The trial was concluded after 60 treatment episodes (30 treatment episodes of each treatment group). There is a lack of clarity regarding the trial design and the analysis of the cross-over data. If a participant was allocated to TENS treatment for an episode of pain and subsequently returned with a further episode of a similar degree of pain, they would then receive the sham TENS treatment (cross-over design). For those experiencing a pain episode of a different severity, it is not clear whether they were re-randomised or given the alternate treatment. Reporting and analysis was based on the total number pain events and not on the number of participants. It is unclear how many participants were crossed over from the TENS group to the sham TENS group and vice versa. The trial had a high risk of bias regarding random sequence generation and allocation concealment; an unclear risk regarding the blinding of participants and personnel; and a low risk regarding the blinding of the outcome assessors and selective outcome reporting. The trial was small and of very low quality; furthermore, given the issue with trial design we were unable to quantitatively analyse the data. Therefore, we present only a narrative summary and caution is advised in interpreting the results. In relation to our pre-defined primary outcomes, the included trial did not report pain relief at two to four weeks post intervention. The trial authors reported that no difference was found in the changes in pain ratings (recorded at one hour and four hours post intervention) between the TENS and the placebo groups. In relation to our secondary outcomes, the analgesic usage during the trial also did not show any difference between groups. Given the quality of the evidence, we are uncertain whether TENS improves overall satisfaction as compared to sham TENS. The ability to cope with activities of daily living was not evaluated. Regarding adverse events, although one case of itching was reported in the TENS group, the site and nature of itching was not clearly stated; hence it cannot be clearly attributed to TENS. Also, two participants receiving 'sham' TENS reported a worsening of pain with the intervention. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Since we have only included one small and very low-quality trial, with a high risk of bias across several domains, we are unable to conclude whether TENS is harmful or beneficial for managing pain in people with SCD. There is a need for a well-designed, adequately-powered, RCT to evaluate the role of TENS in managing pain in people with SCD.
32722787	Curative vs targeted therapy for SCD: does it make more sense to address the root cause than target downstream events?	Sickle cell disease (SCD) places a heavy burden on a global and increasing population predominantly resident in resource-poor and developing countries. Progress continues to be made in preventing childhood mortality, and increasing numbers of chronically ill adults with disease are requiring care for disease sequelae. Curative therapies for SCD are therefore attractive to physicians and investigators focused on SCD. Gene therapies are being developed, and several are now in various stages of early-phase human clinical trials. However, we must also pursue avenues through which we can do the most good for the most people alive today. Such efforts include improving our understanding of disease mechanisms and which disease sequelae most strongly affect survival and interfere with quality of life. The pathways leading to disease sequelae are multiple, complex, and highly interactive. Four drugs have now been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for SCD; however, each has a distinct mechanism and a measurable but limited effect on the many clinical sequelae of SCD. We therefore need to learn how to approach multi-agent therapy for SCD. The order of addition of each agent to treat a specific patient will need to be guided by response to previous therapy, risk factors identified for specific disease outcomes, and clinical studies to determine more comprehensively how the 4 currently approved drugs might interact and produce (or not) additive effects. Moreover, this will have to be accomplished with defined end points in mind, according to which pose the greatest threats to quality of life as well as survival.

37773926	VWF-ADAMTS13 axis dysfunction in children with sickle cell disease treated with hydroxyurea versus blood transfusion.	Previous studies have reported elevated von Willebrand factor (VWF) levels in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and demonstrated a key role for the VWF-ADAMTS13 axis in the pathobiology of SCD vaso-occlusion. Although blood transfusion is the gold standard for stroke prevention in SCD, the biological mechanisms underpinning its improved efficacy compared to hydroxycarbamide are not fully understood. We hypothesized that the improved clinical efficacy of blood transfusion might relate to differences in endothelial cell activation and VWF-ADAMTS13 axis dysfunction. One-hundred-eighty children with a confirmed diagnosis of SCD (HbSS) on hydroxycarbamide (n=96) or blood transfusion (n=84) were included. Despite disease-modifying treatment, plasma VWF and VWF propeptide were elevated in a significant proportion of SCD children (33% and 47% respectively). Crucially, all VWF parameters were significantly higher in the hydroxycarbamide compared to the blood transfusion cohort (p<0.05). Additionally, increased levels of other Weibel-Palade-body-stored proteins, including factor VIII (FVIII), angiopoietin-2, and osteoprotegerin were observed, indicated ongoing endothelial cell activation. Children treated with hydroxycarbamide also had higher FVIII activity and enhanced thrombin generation compared to the blood transfusion cohort (p<0.001), contributing to their thrombotic risk. Finally, hemolysis markers strongly correlated with VWF levels (p<0.001) and significantly reduced in the blood transfusion cohort (p<0.001). Cumulatively, our findings demonstrate for the first time that despite treatment, ongoing dysfunction of the VWF-ADAMTS13 axis is present in a significant sub-group of pediatric SCD patients, especially those treated with hydroxycarbamide. Since VWF plays an important role in vaso-occlusion pathogenesis, these data are of direct translational relevance.
34889358	Gene therapy for sickle cell disease: where we are now?	The landscape of sickle cell disease (SCD) treatment continues to evolve rapidly, with new disease-modifying therapies in development and potentially curative options on the horizon. Until recently, allogeneic stem cell transplant has been the only proven cure for SCD. Gene therapy is rising to the forefront of the discussion as a potentially curative or highly disease- modifying option for abating the complications of the disease. Understanding the different types of gene therapy in use, the differences in their end points, and their potential risks and benefits will be key to optimizing the long-term use of this therapy.
33941871	Successful mismatched hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for pediatric hemoglobinopathy by using ATG and post-transplant cyclophosphamide.	The use of HLA-mismatched (un)related donors is historically associated with a higher incidence of transplant-related complications and mortality. However, the use of such donors may overcome the limited availability of HLA-matched donors for patients with beta-thalassemia major (TM) and sickle cell disease (SCD). We investigated hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) outcomes of pediatric TM and SCD patients treated with a mismatched donor using a treosulfan-based conditioning in combination with ATG and post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PT-CY) and compared these results to the clinical outcome of patients treated by matched donor HSCT without PT-CY. Thirty-eight children (n = 24 HLA-identical or 10/10-matched donors; n = 14 HLA-mismatched donors), who received a non-depleted bone marrow graft were included. Event-free survival (EFS) and GvHD were not higher in the mismatched PT-Cy group as compared to the matched group. Moreover, despite delayed neutrophil engraftment (day +22 vs. +26, p = 0.002) and immune recovery in the mismatched PT-Cy group, this did not result in more infectious complications. Therefore, we conclude that in the absence of an HLA-identical or a matched unrelated donor, HSCT with a mismatched unrelated or haploidentical donor in combination with ATG plus PT-CY can be considered a safe and effective treatment option for pediatric hemoglobinopathy patients.
37914454	"SCULP" study: The benefits of skin graft pellets on the pain of sickle cell leg ulcers (SCLU).	BACKGROUND: Leg ulcers associated with major sickle cell disease (SCLU) are a chronic, painful complication, often treated by autologous skin graft. The analgesic effect of skin grafting in SCLU is poorly studied. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of skin grafting on the pain and healing of SCLU. METHODS: Patients hospitalized for SCLU skin grafting were included in a retrospective and prospective observational cohort, between 2019 and 2023: 53 autologous pinch grafts were performed on a total of 35 SCLUs in 25 sickle cell patients. The primary endpoint was the evaluation of the analgesic effect of the skin graft, measured by visual analog scale (VAS) and weekly cumulative analgesic consumption between day (D)0, D7 and D30. Wound healing was assessed by variation in wound areas between D0 and D30. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients with a median age range of 45.5years old were included, 68% were men, SS genotype was present in 96% of the cases. At D7, a significant decrease in VAS and consumption of analgesics of all classes was observed. At D30, only a significant decrease in VAS and consumption of mild opioids was present, as well as a significant reduction in wound surface area compared with D0. CONCLUSION: Pinch grafts have a significant early analgesic effect in the management of patients with SCLU, and significantly notice reduction of wound surface area within one month.
33484967	BMI1 enables extensive expansion of functional erythroblasts from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.	Transfusion of red blood cells (RBCs) from ABO-matched but genetically unrelated donors is commonly used for treating anemia and acute blood loss. Increasing demand and insufficient supply for donor RBCs, especially those of universal blood types or free of known and unknown pathogens, has called for ex vivo generation of functional RBCs by large-scale cell culture. However, generating physiological numbers of transfusable cultured RBCs (cRBCs) ex vivo remains challenging, due to our inability to either extensively expand primary RBC precursors (erythroblasts) or achieve efficient enucleation once erythroblasts have been expanded and induced to differentiation and maturation. Here, we report that ectopic expression of the human BMI1 gene confers extensive expansion of human erythroblasts, which can be derived readily from adult peripheral blood mononuclear cells of either healthy donors or sickle cell patients. These extensively expanded erythroblasts (E3s) are able to proliferate exponentially (>1 trillion-fold in 2 months) in a defined culture medium. Expanded E3 cells are karyotypically normal and capable of terminal maturation with approximately 50% enucleation. Additionally, E3-derived cRBCs can circulate in a mouse model following transfusion similar to primary human RBCs. Therefore, we provide a facile approach of generating physiological numbers of human functional erythroblasts ex vivo.
31808832	Optimal disease management and health monitoring in adults with sickle cell disease.	In countries with access to organized health care, survival of children with sickle cell disease (SCD) has greatly improved, resulting in a growing population of adults with SCD. Transition from pediatric to adult care presents many challenges for the patient, who now faces the reality of emerging complications in many organs that are cumulative, adding to other age-related nonsickle conditions that interact and add to the disease morbidity. We recommend regular comprehensive annual assessments, monitoring for early signs of organ damage and joint clinics with relevant specialists, if applicable. While maintaining a low threshold for intervention with disease-modifying therapies, we should always keep in mind that there is no single complication that is pathognomonic of SCD, and nonsickle comorbidities should always be excluded and treated if present. We need to reevaluate our approach to managing adults with SCD by putting a greater emphasis on multidisciplinary care while proactively considering curative options (hematopoietic stem cell transplant and gene therapy) and experimental pharmacological agents for adults with SCD of all ages before complications render the patients ineligible for these treatments.
32003198	[Evaluation of the Follow-Up and State of Adolescents with Sickle-Cell Disease in Brazzaville (Congo)].	The experience of the adolescent with homozygous sickle-cell disease is influenced by several factors that differentiate it from the older child entirely dependent on his parents. The objective of this study was to describe the state of health and to assess the quality of follow-up and to identify the determinants of poor monitoring of adolescent sickle-cell followed in Brazzaville for an average of 12 +- 9.6 years, starting from a cross-sectional study carried out at the Brazzaville University Hospital from March to September 2016. It is based on a questionnaire composed of elements of assessment of the state of health and the quality of the follow-up. The vaccination coverage of adolescents was low, 81.3% for DTCP, 66.5% for Typhim Vi, 50.2% for viral hepatitis B, 76.4% for pneumococcus, and 59.1% for the ROR. In the last two years prior to the survey, 99 (48.7%) adolescents had only 2 follow-up visits instead of 4 planned per year. Therapeutic compliance was good in 132 (65%). No hospitalizations were reported during this period in 23 adolescents (11.3%); in 180 cases (88.7%), however, adolescents were hospitalized one to three times apart from regular follow-up visits. Since the discovery of the disease, 177 (87.2%) adolescents had already been transfused, more than three times in 89 cases. A history of neurovascular seizures was found in 10 cases (5.2%) and priapism in 35 cases (18.2%). Paraclinical examinations were not systematic during follow-up visits. The socioeconomic level of the family and the level of education of the father had a negative impact on monitoring and adherence (P < 0.01). On clinical examinations, stunting, undernutrition, pubertal delay, tooth decay, enuresis were found in 45.3%, 36%, 53.7%, 27.6%, 15.3%, respectively. The biological examinations carried out during the investigation showed an average inter-critical hemoglobin level between 7 and 8 g/dl, creatinine level was normal in all cases, ferritinemia was elevated in 93.6%, a negative proteinuria was found in 71.4% of the cases, and hematuria in 26.6%. Systematic abdominal ultrasound revealed vesicular lithiasis in 8 cases, hepatomegaly in 10 cases, and splenomegaly in 102 cases. Echocardiography performed in all subjects showed cardiomyopathy in 9 cases. The follow-up of the adolescent sickle-cell in Brazzaville still faces enormous difficulties. The improvement of the standard of living, the therapeutic education and the introduction of a total free of charge of the global management of sickle-cell disease would make it possible to minimize these difficulties which also would improve the future of these teenagers, adults of tomorrow.
36069257	Iron Chelators, Such as Deferasirox, When Combined With Hydroxyurea, Provide an Additional Benefit of Iron Chelation in Patients Receiving Chronic Transfusion Therapy.	Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions have been established as one of the primary therapies in treating sickle cell anemia. However, they are not free of side effects, with overloading the body with iron being one of the most important. Iron chelation therapy greatly reduces the iron load of the body. In addition, hydroxyurea (HU), an oral chemotherapeutic drug also has a significant role in the treatment of the disease with beneficial effects on many of the clinical problems that arise, mainly in reducing painful crises. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of synergistic transfusion therapy and HU on the response to deferasirox (DFX) chelation therapy. Eighteen patients with sickle cell disease were divided into two groups based on their treatment, either with simple transfusions and DFX or with a combination of transfusion therapy, DFX and HU, and were evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for liver iron concentration (LIC) and biochemistry. All patients completed the study. The results of the study showed improvement in serum ferritin (FER) levels and LIC after 12 months of therapy in both groups, especially in the group receiving the combination therapy with HU. In addition, there was a noteworthy improvement in serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels with serum creatinine (Cr) levels remaining stable during the study in both groups. Hydroxyurea, when combined with iron chelators such as DFX, provides an additional benefit of iron chelation in patients receiving chronic transfusion therapy.
35385685	Of mice and men: From hematopoiesis in mouse models to curative gene therapy for sickle cell disease.	Through studies in mice and in humans, Stuart Orkin showed that GATA-1 is a master transcriptional regulator of hematopoiesis. He has highlighted the role of BCL11A in the fetal-adult hemoglobin switch. The Gairdner Foundation Award recognizes Orkin's contribution to the development of gene therapy of sickle cell disease.
37839398	"Don't add fuel to the fire"- Hyperhemolysis Syndrome in a pregnant woman with compound Sickle cell disease/ss0-thalassemia - Case report and review of the literature.	Hyperhemolysis Syndrome (HHS) is a rare and severe post-transfusion complication characterized by the destruction of both recipient and donor red blood cells (RBC). The underlying mechanism of HHS is not fully understood and proper management can be difficult. Furthermore, there are few reports regarding HHS in pregnancy. We report on the development and management of HHS in a pregnant woman with known compound Sickle cell disease/ss-0-thalassemia after transfusion of not fully compatible packed red blood cells (PRBC). We aim to raise awareness on this diagnostically challenging and life-threatening type of hemolysis with this report, and to stress the need to consider the diagnosis of HHS in SCD patients with progressive anemia despite PRBC administration.
33941758	COVID-19 Presentation in Patients with Sickle Cell Disease: A Case Series.	BACKGROUND Certain health conditions have been proven to have an effect on the severity of COVID-19, the disease caused by SAR-COV-2. The list of identified comorbid conditions includes hematological diseases, with sickle cell disease (SCD) falling into this category. CASE REPORT This case series examines the history, presentation, and clinical course of 5 patients with SCD who tested positive for SAR-COV-2 during the spring and summer of 2020. These patients experienced COVID-19 severities ranging from a mild cough and congestion to 8-day hospitalizations requiring blood transfusions. CONCLUSIONS While there is still a great amount of research on the interaction between COVID-19 and SCD needed, from this study we have concluded that patients with SCD do not always present with the classic COVID-19 triad of cough, shortness of breath, and fever. Often, these patients present with symptoms of vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC), including severe leg, flank, and chest pain, as was seen in 4 of 5 of our patients. We, and several other researchers, believe that this association between COVID-19 and VOC could be due to COVID-19 triggering inflammatory cytokines (notably IL-6) leading to system-wide inflammation, which induces sickling of the red blood cells. Based on this report, we recommend that SCD patients presenting with VOC who have had exposure to SAR-COV-2 be promptly tested for SAR-COV-2 to guide treatment and reduce mortality and morbidity in this vulnerable population.
32712327	HLA-Matched Unrelated Donors for Patients with Sickle Cell Disease: Results of International Donor Searches.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common inherited hemoglobinopathy. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) is the sole curative therapy for SCD, but few patients will have a matched sibling donor. Patients with SCD are mostly of African origin and thus are less likely to find a matched unrelated donor in international registries. Using HaploStats, we estimated HLA haplotypes for 185 patients with SCD (116 from a Brazilian center and 69 from European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation [EBMT] centers) and classified the ethnic origin of haplotypes. Then we assessed the probability of finding an HLA-matched unrelated adult donor (MUD), considering loci A, B, and DRB1 (6/6), in international registries. Most haplotypes were African, but Brazilians showed a greater ethnic admixture than EBMT patients. Nevertheless, the chance of finding at least one 6/6 potential allelic donor was 47% for both groups. Most potential allelic donors were from the US National Marrow Donor Program registry and from the Brazilian REDOME donor registry. Although the probability of finding a donor is higher than previously reported, strategies are needed to improve ethnic diversity in registries. Moreover, predicting the likelihood of having an MUD might influence SCD management.
32744117	Communicating and understanding pain: Limitations of pain scales for patients with sickle cell disorder and other painful conditions.	Pain communication in healthcare is challenging. We examine use of pain scales to communicate pain severity via a case study of people with sickle cell disorder (SCD). We show how pain communication involves complex social interactions between patients, healthcare professionals and significant others - none of which are included in pain ratings. Failure to account for relational aspects of pain may cause problems for any patient. For SCD, mutual distrust shapes pain communication, further complicating clinical assessments. Moreover, SCD pain is particularly severe, making ratings hard to interpret compared with ratings from non-SCD patients, potentially exacerbating problems in managing pain relief.
34559236	Transfusion-Transmitted Malaria: Two Pediatric Cases From the United States and Their Relevance in an Increasingly Globalized World.	In non-endemic settings, transfusion-transmitted malaria (TTM) is rare but potentially fatal and becoming more common with globalization. We present two pediatric cases that demonstrate donor screening using questionnaires is subject to error and that TTM should be considered with fever following numerous transfusions in children, particularly sickle cell patients.
33189570	Red blood cell exchange in an emergency in sickle cell disease.	Red blood cell exchange (RBCEx) has become a standard therapy to remove abnormal red blood cells (RBCs) in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). In the last few decades, numerous RBCEx procedures have been performed chronically during regular programs, while numerous procedures have also been performed in an emergency for several indications, this therapeutic option being very efficient in vital and emergency situations. In both groups of indications, large amounts of sickle RBCs have to be removed, which requires great precision and the setting of specific hematological targets. The aim of this review is to discuss the aims, clinical and biological targets, and the requirements and precautions when performing RBCEx in an emergency. Moreover, we analyze how improvement of the techniques as well as the clinical and biological targets has led to optimization of the procedures in emergency settings. We also consider the outstanding issues that require additional investigation.
32577055	Laparoscopic Splenectomy in Children: Safety of Ligasure Usage.	INTRODUCTION: Laparoscopic splenectomy started to be more popular and nowadays it is the first choice for splenectomy in children. The main advantages of laparoscopic splenectomy over open approach are the shorter hospital stay, low complications and the cosmetic results despite the main concern of long operative time and the intra operative bleeding. AIM: The aim of this study was to report our experience with laparoscopic splenectomy in children's with hematological diseases using ligasure regarding vascular control safety, efficacy and complications rate. METHODS: A retrospective study was carried out at Queen Rania Al-Abdullah Hospital for Children over the period from January 2017 to February 2019. Total number of 18 patients with hematological diseases underwent laparoscopic splenectomy using ligasure. Demographic data, complications and outcomes were collected to assess the advantages of ligasure usage for vascular control safety. RESULTS: Out of 18 patients underwent laparoscopic splenectomy using ligasure (10 with spherocytosis, 4 with immune thrombocytopenic purpura [ITP], 3 with sickle cell anemia, 1 with hemangioma), from which number, 8 patients were males and 10 were females. Mean age was 6.7 years (ranges from 4.3 to13.7 years). Mean operative time was 107 minutes (ranges from 70-180 minutes). There was no conversion to open splenectomy and no mortality. Intra operative blood loss was insignificant. CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic splenectomy using ligature is safe with excellent results in decreasing operative time, less complications and decrease incidence of intraoperative bleeding.
34786695	A randomised controlled provider-blinded trial of community health workers in sickle cell anaemia: effects on haematologic variables and hydroxyurea adherence.	Hydroxyurea (hydroxycarbamide) (HU) for sickle cell anaemia (SCA) is underutilised. Case management is an evidence-based health management strategy and in this regard patient navigators (PNs) may provide case management for SCA. We hypothesised that HU-eligible patients exposed to PNs would have improved indicators of starting HU and HU adherence. We randomised 224 HU-eligible SCA adults into the Start Healing in Patients with Hydroxyurea (SHIP-HU) Trial. All patients received care from trained physicians using standardised HU prescribing protocols. Patients in the Experimental arm received case management and education from PNs through multiple contacts. All other patients were regarded as the Control arm and received specialty care alone. Study physicians were blinded to the study arms and did not interact with PNs. At baseline, 6 and 12 months we assessed and compared laboratory parameters and HU adherence indicators. Experimental patients had higher 6-month mean fetal haemoglobin (HbF) levels than controls. But at 12 months, mean HbF was similar, as were white blood cell count, absolute neutrophil count, total haemoglobin, platelet count and mean corpuscular volume. At 12 months there were fewer experimental patients missing HU doses than controls (mean 1 8 vs. 4 5, P = 0 0098), and more recent HU prescriptions filled than for controls (mean 53 8 vs. 92 days, median 27 5 vs. 62 days, P = 0 0082). Mean HU doses were largely similar. We detected behavioural improvements in HU adherence but no haematological improvements by adding PNs to specialty care.
34656745	Biopsychosocial factors related to transition among adolescents and young adults with sickle cell disease: A systematic review.	It is critical to support adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with sickle cell disease (SCD) during transition to adult healthcare. We provide a systematic review of literature related to biopsychosocial influences on transition among AYAs with SCD. Data sources included studies published between January 2010 and May 2020. Forty-four studies were included. Biopsychosocial factors related to improved transition outcomes included older AYA age, greater disease severity, intact neurocognitive functioning, and greater pain coping skills. Financial and insurance barriers were noted. The importance of cultural considerations and provider communication were noted across two qualitative studies. Ten studies assessed efficacy of transition interventions, with 80 % resulting in improvements; however, retention in programs was low and gaps in knowledge and skills remained. Incorporation of early, ongoing assessments of transition readiness and barriers into culturally-tailored interventions aimed at improving transition outcomes is recommended. Examination of longitudinal relationships and interactions across biopsychosocial influences is needed.
33251574	Gene therapy for sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease encompasses a group of genetic disorders characterized by the presence of at least one hemoglobin S (Hb S) allele, and a second abnormal allele that could allow abnormal haemoglobin polymerisation leading to a symptomatic disorder. Autosomal recessive disorders (such as sickle cell disease) are good candidates for gene therapy because a normal phenotype can be restored in diseased cells with only a single normal copy of the mutant gene. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this review are: - to determine whether gene therapy can improve survival and prevent symptoms and complications associated with sickle cell disease; - to examine the risks of gene therapy against the potential long-term gain for people with sickle cell disease. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, which comprises of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and searching relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We also searched online trial registries, Date of the most recent search of the Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 21 September 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised or quasi-randomised clinical trials (including any relevant phase 1, 2 or 3 trials) of gene therapy for all individuals with sickle cell disease, regardless of age or setting. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: No trials of gene therapy for sickle cell disease were found. MAIN RESULTS: No trials of gene therapy for sickle cell disease were reported. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: No randomised or quasi-randomised clinical trials of gene therapy for sickle cell disease were reported. Thus, no objective conclusions or recommendations in practice can be made on gene therapy for sickle cell disease. This systematic review has identified the need for well-designed, randomised controlled trials to assess the benefits and risks of gene therapy for sickle cell disease.
36965115	Acute chest syndrome in adult patients with sickle cell disease: The relationship with the time to onset after hospital admission.	Data on acute chest syndrome (ACS) in adult sickle cell disease patients are scarce. In this study, we describe 105 consecutive ACS episodes in 81 adult patients during a 32-month period and compare the characteristics as a function of the time to onset after hospital admission for a vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC), that is early-onset episodes (time to onset <=24 h, 42%) versus secondary episodes (>24 h, 58%; median [interquartile range] time to onset: 2 [2-3] days). The median age was 27 [22-34] years, 89% of the patients had an S/S or S/beta0 -thalassaemia genotype; 81% of the patients had a history of ACS (median: 3 [2-5] per patient), only 61% were taking a disease-modifying treatment at the time of the ACS. Fever and chest pain were noted in respectively 54% and 73% of the episodes. Crackles (64%) and bronchial breathing (32%) were the main abnormal auscultatory findings. A positive microbiological test was found for 20% of episodes. Fifty percent of the episodes required a blood transfusion; ICU transfer and mortality rates were respectively 29% and 1%. Secondary and early-onset forms of ACS did not differ significantly. Disease-modifying treatments should be revaluated after each ACS episode because the recurrence rate is high.
32224963	The Relationship between Health Disparities, Psychosocial Functioning and Health Outcomes in Pediatric Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplant Populations: Recommendations for Clinical Care.	Not only do racial and ethnic minority children and adolescents with chronic illness experience disparities in health status and health outcomes, they also experience significant healthcare disparities, including differences in healthcare coverage, access to care, and quality of care. It is well known that the interaction between psychosocial functioning, health behaviors and ethnic and racial disparities, ultimately leads to worse health and psychosocial outcomes in pediatric and AYA chronic illness patient populations, including increased rates of morbidity and mortality. Investigating the impact of racial and ethnic factors on health outcomes, and strategies for reducing these disparities, is of the utmost importance, specifically in life-threatening conditions like cancer and sickle cell disease. This commentary underscores the relative importance of identifying factors that could reduce disparities between minority and non-minority populations. This present paper will focus on the dynamic relationships between health disparities, psychosocial factors and health outcomes within pediatric cancer, sickle cell disease and bone marrow transplant populations, and will offer recommendations for healthcare professionals working with these vulnerable patient populations. The primary goal of this commentary is to provide recommendations for enhancing cultural competency and humility for those working with highly vulnerable patient populations.
34530179	Low Rates of Cerebral Infarction after Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation in Patients with Sickle Cell Disease at High Risk for Stroke.	Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can be curative for sickle cell disease (SCD). SCD patients with cerebrovascular disease are often referred for HSCT. The objective of this study was to describe neurologic outcomes after HSCT in patients with pre-existing SCD and cerebrovascular comorbidity. Patients with SCD treated with HSCT at a single center between 1996 and 2019 were identified. Patients with cerebral ischemia and/or vasculopathy before undergoing HSCT were included. Patients with graft failure were excluded. The cohort was divided into 3 groups: symptomatic stroke, vasculopathy without symptomatic stroke, and isolated silent cerebral infarction (SCI). Magnetic resonance imaging/angiography and neurologic assessments pre- and post-HSCT were analyzed to assess outcomes. In a cohort of 44 patients, there were 25 with symptomatic infarction, 10 with vasculopathy, and 9 with isolated SCI. Post-HSCT ischemic injury (2 symptomatic strokes, 2 SCIs) was identified in 4 patients, all with previous symptomatic infarction. Within this group (n = 25), the post-HSCT incidence of subsequent symptomatic infarction was 1.6 events/100 patient-years, and SCIs occurred at a rate of 2.2 events/100 patient-years. No patient had progression of vasculopathy post-HSCT. Our data show a low incidence of new ischemic injury after successful HSCT for SCD. Patients with a history of both symptomatic stroke and vasculopathy are at greatest risk for post-HSCT ischemic injury.
31722835	[A review of avascular necrosis, of the hip and beyond].	Avascular necrosis is an ischemic or cytotoxic necrosis of epiphyseal bone, responsible for joint pain, altered life quality and frequently affecting young patients. Avascular necrosis can be unifocal or multifocal, underlining the possibility of a systemic origin. Avascular necrosis involves the femoral head in more than 75% of cases. Although avascular necrosis is irreversible, many risk factors must be sought, including corticosteroid treatment, hypercholesterolemia, sickle cell disease or alcohol abuse. MRI imaging is the main exploration for the diagnostic and staging of the disease, and should be performed in unexplained hip pain in young patients with normal X-rays. In the earlier stages of the disease (stage I and II of the Arlet and Ficat classification), joint surface is preserved, and conservative treatment is recommended. In the more advanced stages (III and IV of the Arlet and Ficat classification), the articular surface collapses and joint arthroplasty is the main treatment. However, there are some recent therapeutic advances, based on mesenchymal stem cells, which may contribute, in the future, to improve the bad functional prognosis of the disease.
35612367	Emergency department visits and hospitalizations among patients with sickle cell disease in illinois, 2016-2020.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) state level surveillance data are limited. We performed a retrospective review of emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations from individuals with SCD in Illinois (2016-2020) using the Illinois Health and Hospital Association's Comparative Health Care and Hospital Data Reporting Services. There were 48,094 outpatient ED visits and 31,686 hospitalizations. Most visits (67%) occurred in Cook County, were covered by public insurance (77%) and were from individuals with medium high (40.3%) or high (36.1%) poverty levels. SCD healthcare utilization remains high and surveillance data may inform SCD program development and resource allocation at the state level.AbbreviationsCDCCenters for Disease Control and PreventionEDEmergency DepartmentFDAFood & Drug AdministrationICDInternational Classification of DiseasesILIllinoisSCDSickle cell disease.
33193983	[Prevalence of sickle cell trait in blood donors at the regional blood transfusion center in the Haute Matsiatra Region, Madagascar].	INTRODUCTION: sickle cell trait is the heterozygous form of sickle-cell disease. Patients with sickle cell trait can synthesize normal hemoglobin A and hemoglobin S. This condition has no recognizable clinical signs; then subjects with sickle cell trait, ignoring their genetic status, can be found among blood donors. This can have severe impact on donors  health status and on that of recipients, especially if these have sickle-cell trait. The purpose of our study is to determine the prevalence of sickle cell trait in blood donors. METHODS: we conducted a 4-month descriptive prospective study (January-May 2017) at the Haute Matsiatra Regional Blood Transfusion Center (RBTC). All donors were screened by Emmel test and positive cases were confirmed by hemoglobin electrophoresis. RESULTS: the study involved 427 donors, of whom 332 were men and 95 women (sex ratio 3.4). The average age of blood donors was 32.72, ranging from 18 to 64 years. Emmel test was positive in 5 donors (1.17%). These patients had the AS genotype confirmed by hemoglobin electrophoresis. CONCLUSION: the results of this study reveal the presence of sickle cell trait among blood donors at the CRTS. Most of them ignore their sickle cell status before blood donation. Quality and safety of blood and blood products are mandatory, hence the importance of screening among blood donors is a current relevant issue.
36053868	Algorithm-based selection of automated red blood cell exchange procedure goals reduces blood utilization in chronically transfused adults with sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Automated red cell exchange (RCE) is a common treatment for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Two key parameters are used to determine the volume of blood for RCE to reduce sickle hemoglobin (eg, HbS): fraction of cells remaining (FCR) and target hematocrit. We evaluated how the calculated FCR-using the manufacturer's algorithm-impacted blood utilization and incidence of acute care encounters. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Retrospective chart review was conducted of 15 adults with SCD who underwent chronic RCE from July 1, 2015 to August 31, 2019. Blood utilization and acute care encounters were compared across three time periods: (a) when a fixed FCR of 30% was used (12 months); (b) transition period during which physicians made ad hoc changes to the FCR (25 months); (c) algorithm phase when a procedural FCR between 30% and 50% was selected using an algorithm generated by the manufacturer's built-in software to target a HbS fraction of 8% post-procedure (12 months). Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to determine statistical significance. RESULTS: Median blood utilization per procedure decreased from 2398 mL (interquartile range [IQR]: 2271-2759 mL) during the fixed FCR phase to 1887 mL (IQR: 1495-2241 mL) during the algorithm phase (P < 0.001). Similarly, median number of units transfused decreased from 10 (9-11) to 7 (5-9) during the respective phases (P < 0.001). Visits to the emergency department were 1 (0-4) in the fixed FCR phase and 0 (0-3) in the algorithm phase. CONCLUSION: Algorithm-based selection of a procedural FCR significantly reduced blood utilization (~21%) without appearing to increase acute care encounters.
33514354	Severe COVID-19 with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in a sickle cell disease adult patient: case report.	BACKGROUND: Sickle-cell anaemia is a widespread genetic disease prevalent worldwide among African and African-American populations. The pathogenesis is most often revealed by pulmonary conditions, including acute thoracic syndrome, which is affecting the life expectancy of these populations. The global spread of CoV2-SARS infection with a respiratory tropism, endothelial damages and procoagulant status endangers the SCD population. However, with only a few case reports, consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic on SCD population remain poorly known. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 33-year-old man with a history of homozygous SS homozygous sickle cell anemia who consulted on March 24, 2020 for febrile dyspnea 11 days after the onset of symptoms. A nasopharyngeal swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2. His respiratory status worsened rapidly in the emergency room and then in ICU leading to severe ARDS requiring intubation, curarization, and venovenous ECMO. Hematologically, severe hemolysis associated with major thrombocytopenia without documented spinal cord injury was noted. Several transfusion exchanges are performed. The evolution was finally slowly favorable and led to discharge from the intensive care unit and then from the hospital. CONCLUSIONS: This case recalls the importance of an increased prevention policy against COVID-19among the SCD population. In addition, from a therapeutic point of view, it advocates (1) a high preventive anticoagulation from the outset according to the level of D-dimers (2) the use of venovenous ECMO in this particular case, whereas this technique has had rather disappointing results in acute chest syndromes. (3) Unexpectedly, our patient did not develop pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and acute cor pulmonale (ACP), whereas this is a common feature of ARDS during SCD. These last two observations suggest a different pathophysiology of pulmonary disorders in SCD patients in the case of SARS COv2. It could be associated with marked hypoxemia secondary to pulmonary vascular vasodilation.
32147059	Preliminary evaluation of the clinical implementation of cognitive-behavioral therapy for chronic pain management in pediatric sickle cell disease.	OBJECTIVES: Evaluate the implementation of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for chronic pain in a clinical setting by comparing youth with sickle cell disease (SCD) who initiated or did not initiate CBT. DESIGN: Youth with SCD (ages 6-18; n = 101) referred for CBT for chronic pain were compared based on therapy attendance: Established Care; Early Termination; or Comparison (i.e., did not initiate CBT). SETTING: Outpatient pediatric psychology and comprehensive SCD clinics in 3 locations at a southeastern children's hospital. INTERVENTIONS: CBT delivery was standardized. Treatment plans were tailored to meet individualized needs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Healthcare utilization included pain-related inpatient admissions, total inpatient days, and emergency department reliance (EDR) at 12-months pre-post CBT. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) included typical pain intensity, functional disability, and coping efficacy pre-post treatment. RESULTS: Adjusting for age, genotype, and hydroxyurea, early terminators of CBT had increased rates of admissions and hospital days over time relative to comparisons; those who established care had faster reduction in admissions and hospital days over time relative to comparisons. EDR decreased by 0.08 over time for Established Care and reduced by 0.01 for every 1 completed session. Patients who completed pre- and post-treatment PROs reported decreases in typical pain intensity, functional disability, and improved coping efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: Establishing CBT care may support reductions in admissions for pain, length of stay, and EDR for youth with chronic SCD pain, which may be partially supported by patient-reported improvements in functioning, coping, and lower pain intensity following CBT. Enhancing clinical implementation of multidisciplinary treatments may optimize the health of these youth.
35584830	How to approach haemolysis: Haemolytic anaemia for the general physician.	Haemolytic anaemia can seem like a complicated topic. The constellation of reticulocytosis, increased lactate dehydrogenase levels, increased unconjugated bilirubin levels and decreased haptoglobin levels should prompt general physicians to consider haemolysis as a differential diagnosis. When further approaching haemolytic anaemia, subdividing patients into those who are 'direct antiglobulin test (DAT) positive' (immune) or 'DAT negative' (non-immune) is a simple and clinically relevant way to start to formulate a cause for the haemolytic anaemia. Immune causes of haemolytic anaemia include autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, drugs and delayed haemolytic transfusion reactions. Non-immune causes include the haemoglobinopathies (such as sickle cell disease) and microangiopathic haemolytic anaemias (such as disseminated intravascular coagulation). Early supportive care in haemolytic anaemia is important and may involve blood transfusions as well as interventions to slow the rate of haemolysis, such as steroids in autoimmune haemolytic anaemia. Complications of haemolysis include pigment gallstones, high-output cardiac failure and thromboembolism. Haemolytic anaemia should be referred to the haematologist for further investigation, however, the recognition and early management by the general physician is imperative in improving the patient's outcome.
32682328	The Effects of Antepartum Depressive Symptoms on Postcesarean Opioid Consumption.	OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to test the hypothesis that higher Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) scores are associated with increased pain scores and opioid use during postpartum hospitalization following cesarean section. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective cohort of English or Spanish-speaking women >=18 years who had prenatal care for a singleton gestation and delivered by cesarean at >=36 weeks within a tertiary center during 2017. Exclusions included women with fetal anomalies, intrauterine fetal demise, sickle cell disease, previously diagnosed pain disorders (e.g., chronic pain or fibromyalgia), substance use disorder (based on documented prescription or use of methadone or buprenorphine), or reoperation during hospital stay. Women without an EPDS recorded antenatally were also excluded. Major depressive symptoms (MDS) were defined as a documented antenatal EPDS >=12. Women with and without MDS were compared, and multivariable linear regression models were generated to evaluate associations between MDS status and both pain scores and opioid use. RESULTS: Of the 891 women meeting other inclusion criteria, 676 (76%) had documented antenatal EPDS scores, and 104 (15.4%) of those had MDS. Women with MDS were more likely to be use tobacco and have general anesthesia for cesarean delivery, but groups were otherwise similar. Women with MDS reported higher daily and average pain scores postpartum (2.4 vs. 1.7 average; p < 0.001). Women with MDS used more morphine milligram equivalents (MME) each day during their postpartum hospitalization, leading to a higher total MME use (121 mg [60.5-214.5] vs. 75 mg [28.5-133.5], p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: We found an association between antepartum depressive symptoms and acute pain after cesarean delivery leading to increased opioid use. Given the current focus on opioid stewardship, further research into this association, exploration of tailored pain control, and determining whether treatment of antepartum MDS reduces postpartum pain, and therefore opioid use, will be of the utmost priority. KEY POINTS:   Women with MDS report higher pain scores postcesarean..   Women with MDS use more opioids postcesarean..   Future studies are needed for the treatment of MDS..
33476759	Epidemiology, characteristics and outcome of children hospitalized with COVID-19 in Oman: A multicenter cohort study.	OBJECTIVES: To describe the epidemiology, clinical and laboratory features, and outcome of children hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the Middle East. METHODS: A multicenter retrospective study of children hospitalized with COVID-19 in 7 centers across Oman between February and July 2020. RESULTS: In total, 56 children <14 years old required hospitalization in 7 Omani centers over 5 months (February - July 2020). Thirty-seven (68%) children were admitted with uncomplicated COVID-19, 13 (23%) with pneumonia and 5 (9%) with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Infants constituted 41% of cases (23/56), approximately half of whom (12/23, 52%) were <2-months old. Fever was the most common symptom (46, 82%), followed by respiratory symptoms (33, 59%), and gastrointestinal symptoms (31, 55%). Twenty-two (39%) children had underlying medical conditions: sickle cell disease (7, 13%), chronic respiratory disease (4, 7%) and severe neurological impairment (4, 7%). Leukocytosis, elevated inflammatory markers and anemia were independently associated with intensive care admission. There were no mortalities related to admission with COVID-19 in this cohort. CONCLUSION: Most of the children hospitalized with COVID-19 had a mild course and a satisfactory outcome. Sickle cell disease is the most common comorbidity associated with pediatric admission of COVID-19 in Oman.
37777924	Erythrocytapheresis in a Patient of Sickle Cell Disease Presenting in Crisis.	As per American Society of Apheresis (ASFA) guidelines, the indication for Erythrocytapheresis for sickle cell patients is category III for preoperative management and vaso-occlusive crisis. Erythrocytapheresis, with the help of automated cell separators, has the benefit of reducing the Sickle hemoglobin (HbS) levels to <30.0% with a reduced risk of increasing blood viscosity and single procedure achieving target hemoglobin levels. A 17-year-oldfemale patient who was a known case of sickle cell disease presented to our institution with a vascular necrosis of the right femoral head. Due to the pain and limitations of her day-to-day activities, she was advised for total hip arthroplasty. This patient underwent a successful Erythrocytapheresis using an automated cell separator and was operated on. In a sickle cell patient planned for surgical intervention, the procedure of Erythrocytapheresis can help in decreasing the chances of the patient developing any vaso-occlusive crisis during surgery and in the immediate post-operative period. This technique can help in improving the chances of a successful surgical procedure for such patients.

35313324	Movement Is Life-Optimizing Patient Access to Total Joint Arthroplasty: Anemia and Sickle Cell Disease Disparities.	Anemia and sickle cell anemia before surgery are often unrecognized medical comorbidities that can and should be addressed. Nearly 6% of the American population meets the criteria for anemia. The elderly, along with patients with renal disease, cancer, heart failure, or diabetes mellitus are more likely to be anemic. The most common form of anemia is due to iron deficiency, which can be easily treated before surgery. Sickle cell anemia occurs in 1 in 365 Black births and 1 in 16,300 Hispanic births, with 100,000 Americans currently living with sickle cell anemia. Patients who have anemia or sickle cell anemia are at increased risk for postoperative complications, including the need for blood transfusions and delayed healing. For those with sickle cell disease, surgeries can precipitate a sickle cell crisis. Patients with sickle cell anemia face barriers in accessing appropriate care; however, these patients can be optimized using preoperative red blood cell transfusions to dilute sickle cells and elevate the hemoglobin level. There should also be careful consideration and monitoring of the pain level of patients with sickle cell anemia in the perioperative period.
38132168	Evaluation of Mono- and Bi-Functional GLOBE-Based Vectors for Therapy of beta-Thalassemia by HBBAS3 Gene Addition and Mutation-Specific RNA Interference.	Therapy via the gene addition of the anti-sickling betaAS3-globin transgene is potentially curative for all beta-hemoglobinopathies and therefore of particular clinical and commercial interest. This study investigates GLOBE-based lentiviral vectors (LVs) for betaAS3-globin addition and evaluates strategies for an increased beta-like globin expression without vector dose escalation. First, we report the development of a GLOBE-derived LV, GLV2-betaAS3, which, compared to its parental vector, adds anti-sickling action and a transcription-enhancing 848-bp transcription terminator element, retains high vector titers and allows for superior beta-like globin expression in primary patient-derived hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Second, prompted by our previous correction of HBBIVSI-110(G>A) thalassemia based on RNApol(III)-driven shRNAs in mono- and combination therapy, we analyzed a series of novel LVs for the RNApol(II)-driven constitutive or late-erythroid expression of HBBIVSI-110(G>A)-specific miRNA30-embedded shRNAs (shRNAmiR). This included bifunctional LVs, allowing for concurrent betaAS3-globin expression. LVs were initially compared for their ability to achieve high beta-like globin expression in HBBIVSI-110(G>A)-transgenic cells, before the evaluation of shortlisted candidate LVs in HBBIVSI-110(G>A)-homozygous HSPCs. The latter revealed that beta-globin promoter-driven designs for monotherapy with HBBIVSI-110(G>A)-specific shRNAmiRs only marginally increased beta-globin levels compared to untransduced cells, whereas bifunctional LVs combining miR30-shRNA with betaAS3-globin expression showed disease correction similar to that achieved by the parental GLV2-betaAS3 vector. Our results establish the feasibility of high titers for LVs containing the full HBB transcription terminator, emphasize the importance of the HBB terminator for the high-level expression of HBB-like transgenes, qualify the therapeutic utility of late-erythroid HBBIVSI-110(G>A)-specific miR30-shRNA expression and highlight the exceptional potential of GLV2-betaAS3 for the treatment of severe beta-hemoglobinopathies.
32516073	Using Artificial Intelligence to Predict Surgical Shunts in Men with Ischemic Priapism.	PURPOSE: Ischemic priapism is a urological emergency that requires prompt intervention to preserve erectile function. Characteristics that influence escalation to surgical intervention remain unclear. We identified factors and developed machine learning models to predict which men presenting with ischemic priapism will require shunting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified men with ischemic priapism admitted to the emergency department of our large county hospital between January 2010 and June 2019. We collected patient demographics, etiology, duration of priapism prior to intervention, interventions attempted and escalation to shunting. Machine learning models were trained and tested using R to predict which patients require surgical shunting. RESULTS: A total of 334 encounters of ischemic priapism were identified. The majority resolved with intracavernosal phenylephrine injection and/or cavernous aspiration (78%). Shunting was required in 10% of men. Median duration of priapism before intervention was longer for men requiring shunting than for men who did not (48 vs 7 hours, p=0.030). Patients with sickle cell disease as the etiology were less likely to require shunting compared to all other etiologies (2.2% vs 15.2%, p=0.035). CONCLUSIONS: Men with longer duration of priapism before treatment more often underwent shunting. However, phenylephrine injection and aspiration remained effective for priapism lasting more than 36 hours. Having sickle cell disease as the etiology of priapism was protective against requiring shunting. We developed artificial intelligence models that performed with 87.2% accuracy and created an online probability calculator to determine which patients with ischemic priapism may require shunting.
35094624	Experiences of African Americans Living With Sickle Cell Disease.	INTRODUCTION: About 100,000 individuals in the United States live with sickle cell disease (SCD). Palliative care (PC) can improve symptom management for these individuals. The purpose of the study was to explore (a) the experiences of people living with SCD, and (b) their knowledge and perceptions of PC. METHOD: Using a qualitative, descriptive design, adults with SCD were recruited from a foundation in the southeastern United States. Data included social and SCD-related demographics and audio-recorded, semi-structured focus groups. Analysis took a thematic analysis approach. RESULTS: Participants: There were 16 African Americans who participated in the study, 75% of whom were females, and aged 22 to 71 years. Five themes were identified: unique and unpredictable impact of SCD on daily life, the changing experience of SCD over time, stigmatization/marginalization in health care interactions, perceptions of support in managing SCD symptoms/crises, and PC: "What is it?" DISCUSSION: Participants lacked PC knowledge. PC should be offered to individuals with SCD as part of comprehensive SCD management.
36728286	A systematic review comparing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant to gene therapy in sickle cell disease.	INTRODUCTION: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) and gene therapy (GT) are two potentially curative approaches for sickle cell disease (SCD), but they have never been compared in clinical trials. OBJECTIVE: To compare the safety and efficacy of HSCT and GT to assist clinicians and patients in making informed treatment decisions. METHODS: Phase I-III clinical trials and case reports/series were included. Regimens included HSCT from all stem cell sources, lentiviral gene therapy, and gene editing, with any conditioning regimen. We searched Medline and EMBASE databases as of 1st June 2020 for studies reporting HSCT and GT outcomes in SCD. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to assess the risk of bias. Descriptive statistics and post-hoc imputation for standard deviations of mean change in FEV1 and FVC were performed. RESULTS: In total, 56 studies (HSCT, n = 53; GT, n = 3) representing 1,198 patients met inclusion criteria (HSCT, n = 1,158; GT, n = 40). Length of follow-up was 3,881.5 and 58.7 patient-years for HSCT and GT, respectively. Overall quality of evidence was low, with no randomized controlled trials identified. Two-year overall survival for HSCT was 91%; mortality was 2.5% for GT. Acute chest syndrome and vaso-occlusive episodes were reduced post-HSCT and GT. Meta-analysis was not possible due to lack of comparator and heterogeneity in outcome measures reporting. Very few studies reported post-transplant end-organ function. Six secondary malignancies (5 post-HSCT, 1 post-GT) were reported. DISCUSSION: Reporting of SCD-related complications and patient-important outcomes is lacking for both strategies. We advocate for standardized reporting to better compare outcomes within and between treatment groups.
35441384	The Recipient Epidemiology and Donor Evaluation Study-IV-Pediatric (REDS-IV-P): A research program striving to improve blood donor safety and optimize transfusion outcomes across the lifespan.	BACKGROUND: The Recipient Epidemiology and Donor Evaluation Study-IV-Pediatric (REDS-IV-P) is a new iteration of prior National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) REDS programs that focus on improving transfusion recipient outcomes across the lifespan as well as the safety and availability of the blood supply. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The US program includes blood centers and hospitals (22 including 6 free-standing Children's hospitals) in four geographic regions. The Brazilian program has 5 participating hemocenters. A Center for Transfusion Laboratory Studies (CTLS) and a Data Coordinating Center (DCC) support synergistic studies and activities over the 7-year REDS-IV-P program. RESULTS: The US is building a centralized, vein-to-vein (V2V) database, linking information collected from blood donors, their donations, the resulting manufactured components, and data extracts from hospital electronic medical records of transfused and non-transfused patients. Simultaneously, the Brazilian program is building a donor, donation, and component database. The databases will serve as the backbone for retrospective and prospective observational studies in transfusion epidemiology, transfusion recipient outcomes, blood component quality, and emerging blood safety issues. Special focus will be on preterm infants, patients with sickle cell disease, thalassemia or cancer, and the effect of donor biologic variability and component manufacturing on recipient outcomes. A rapid response capability to emerging safety threats has resulted in timely studies related to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). CONCLUSIONS: The REDS-IV-P program endeavors to improve donor-recipient-linked research with a focus on children and special populations while also maintaining the flexibility to address emerging blood safety issues.
35021607	Effects of corticosteroids in patients with sickle cell disease and acute complications: a systematic review and meta-analysis.	Whether corticosteroids improve outcome in patients with acute complications of sickle cell disease (SCD) is still debated. We performed a systematic review of the literature with the aim of estimating effects of corticosteroids on the clinical course of vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) or acute chest syndrome (ACS) in patients with SCD. The primary outcome was transfusion requirement during hospitalization. Studies were identified by search of MEDLINE and CENTRAL database. Three randomized clinical trials (RCT) and three retrospective cohort studies (RCS) were included, involving 3,304 participants and 5,562 VOC or ACS episodes. There was no difference between corticosteroids and standard treatment regarding transfusion requirement overall (odds ratio [OR]=0.98, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.38-2.53) but there was a significant interaction of the study type (P<0.0001): corticosteroid therapy was associated with a lower risk of transfusion in RCT (OR=0.13, 95% CI: 0.04-0.45) and a higher risk of transfusion in RCS (OR=2.12, 95% CI: 1.33-3.40. In RCT, the length of hospital stay was lower with corticosteroids as compared with standard treatment: mean difference - 24 hours (95% CI: -35 to -14). Corticosteroids were associated with an increased risk of hospital readmission as compared with standard treatment, in RCT, RCS, and the entire cohort: OR=5.91, 95% CI: 1.40-24.83; OR=3.28, 95% CI: 1.46-7.36 and OR=3.21, 95% CI: 1.97-5.24, respectively. Corticosteroids were associated with reduced number of transfusions and length of stay in RCT but not in RCS, with more rehospitalizations overall. Additional RCT should be conducted while minimizing the risk of rehospitalizations.
31617585	Innovations in Targeted Anti-Adhesion Treatment for Sickle Cell Disease.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited hemoglobinopathy that leads to significant lifetime morbidity and early mortality. An enhanced understanding of the complex pathophysiology of the disease has elucidated novel therapeutic targets for which new therapies are in development. In order to increase the therapeutic landscape, it has been important to identify the blood vessel and more specifically the endothelium as the target organ in this complex disease. Through this lens, we present a review of new anti-adhesion therapies for SCD in development. The long-term promise of multimodal therapies for SCD is finally on the horizon.
32811217	Contraceptive practices in women with chronic medical conditions.	Contraception in women with severe medical conditions is a potential measure to reduce maternal mortality. We sought to determine the contraceptive use in women with medical conditions at the University Hospital of the West Indies (UHWI) in Jamaica to determine if there is room for improvement in contraceptive use. Participants were identified from the medical out-patient departments and questionnaires administered. Two hundred and sixty females between 18 and 44 years with varied chronic medical conditions were included. Those included were systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), diabetes, hypertension (HTN), thyroid disease, cardiac and renal disease. The total current use of contraception was 58.4%, while 41.6% were not on contraceptives. The use of barrier methods and long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) was 71% and 10%, respectively. The current use of contraception in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) was 84% (p=.004) and in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 14% (p=.028). Fifty-eight (58, 24.2%) of the women were using two or more methods of contraception. There is a role for improving contraceptive use among women with medical conditions as they are at increased risk of pregnancy complications.IMPACT STATEMENTWhat is already known on this subject? Women with medical comorbidities significantly contribute to both direct and indirect causes of maternal mortality. Contraception may play an integral role in reducing the risk of dying in chronically ill women; however, the use of contraception in this group is often suboptimal.What the results of this study add? This study adds to the literature that in this high-risk group, there is an underuse of long-acting reversible contraceptives, which is ideal for this population.What the implications are of these findings for clinical practice or further research? The results will provide evidence that this high-risk group of women should be targeted and counselled regarding their risk of morbidity and mortality in pregnancy as well as contraception use while their condition is optimised. From this evidence, services may be put in place in institutions, especially in low-resource settings.
37093647	Simultaneous adjunctive treatment of malaria and its coevolved genetic disorder sickle cell anemia.	Effective treatments for genetic disorders that co-evolved with pathogens require simultaneous betterment of both conditions. Hydroxyurea (HU) offers safe and efficacious treatment for sickle cell anaemia (SCA) by reducing clinical complications, transfusions, and death. Despite concerns that HU-treatment for SCA would increase infection risk by the human malaria Plasmodium falciparum, (the genetic driver of the sickle mutation), HU instead reduced clinical malaria. We utilized physiologically relevant drug exposures that mimic in vivo pharmacokinetics in humans. Under these conditions, we showed that HU and other ribonucleotide reductase (rnr) inhibitors, have significant, intrinsic killing activity in vitro against schizont stages of P. falciparum in both normal and sickle red blood cells. Long-term in vitro selection with HU increased expression of Pfrnr genes but showed low risk of eliciting stably resistant parasites or compromising potency of current antimalarial drugs. Additive activity devoid of antagonism by HU was observed with a wide spectrum of commonly used antimalarial treatments. These data endorse broad, safe, long-term use of HU for SCA in malaria endemic countries and provide a novel biological model for treatment of a genetic disorder with simultaneous, adjunct therapy of a life-threatening infection needed in a global health setting.
32199810	Prognostic Value of Hyponatremia During Acute Painful Episodes in Sickle Cell Disease.	BACKGROUND: Low plasma sodium concentration has been recognized as a prognostic factor in several disorders but never evaluated in sickle cell disease. The present study evaluates its value at admission to predict a complication in adult patients with sickle cell disease hospitalized for an initially uncomplicated acute painful episode. METHODS: The primary outcome of this retrospective study, performed between 2010 and 2015 in a French referral center for sickle cell disease, was a composite criterion including acute chest syndrome, intensive care unit transfer, red blood cell transfusion or inpatient death. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, hemoglobin genotype and concentration, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentration, and white blood cell count. RESULTS: We included 1218 stays (406 patients). No inpatient death occurred during the study period. Hyponatremia (plasma sodium <=135 mmol/L) at admission in the center was associated with the primary outcome (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.95, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3-2.91, P = 0.001), with acute chest syndrome (OR 1.95 [95% CI 1.2-3.17, P = 0.008]), and red blood cell transfusion (OR 2.71 [95% CI 1.58-4.65, P <0.001]) but not significantly with intensive care unit transfer (OR 1.83 [95% CI 0.94-3.79, P = 0.074]). Adjusted mean length of stay was longer by 1.1 days (95% CI 0.5-1.6, P <0.001) in patients with hyponatremia at admission. CONCLUSIONS: Hyponatremia at admission in the medical department for an acute painful episode is a strong and independent prognostic factor of unfavorable outcome and, notably, acute chest syndrome. It could help targeting patients who may benefit from closer monitoring.

31808845	Management of liver complications in sickle cell disease.	Liver disease is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Despite this, the natural history of liver disease is not well characterized and the evidence basis for specific therapeutic intervention is not robust. The spectrum of clinical liver disease encountered includes asymptomatic abnormalities of liver function; acute deteriorations in liver function, sometimes with a dramatic clinical phenotype; and decompensated chronic liver disease. In this paper, the pathophysiology and clinical presentation of patients with acute and chronic liver disease will be outlined. Advice will be given regarding initial assessment and investigation. The evidence for specific medical and surgical interventions will be reviewed, and management recommendations made for each specific clinical presentation. The potential role for liver transplantation will be considered in detail.
34931522	The contribution of family physicians to chronic disease management through continuity of care in Ghana.	Chronic non-communicable diseases contribute significantly to Ghana's disease burden. Ghana's ability to achieve universal health coverage is threatened by the rising burden of chronic non-communicable diseases. There is a high unmet need for cardiovascular diseases care, with primary health care for cardiovascular diseases not being readily available, equitable, or sensitive to the requirements of target populations. The contribution of family physicians in the management of the chronic disease burden through care continuity cannot be overemphasised. This is a short report of the implementation of a chronic care clinic by a family physician in Manna Mission Hospital, which is located in the Greater Accra region of Ghana. Before the implementation, there was no such clinic in the hospital and patients with chronic conditions who visited the facility were sometimes lost to follow-up. The clinic which commenced in January 2019 has provided care for patients with chronic non-communicable diseases to date. The most common chronic diseases managed at the clinic include hypertension and heart failure, diabetes, stroke, asthma, sickle cell disease, and joint disorders. This report gives an account of the contribution of family physicians to chronic disease burden management through continuity of care in a low-resource setting like Ghana.
37081816	Transition readiness in adolescents and young adults with chronic genetic skin conditions.	BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Healthcare transition (HCT) refers to movement from pediatric to adult healthcare models. Lack of HCT preparation contributes to poor health outcomes. This study measures readiness to transition in individuals with genetic skin conditions. METHODS: Participants signed IRB-approved consents/assents. Participants ages 14-22 years with genetic skin disorders were surveyed with measures of QoL (Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index/CDLQI or DLQI) and HCT readiness using the Transition Readiness Assessment Questionnaire (TRAQ) and adapted non-validated measures of Skin Knowledge and Psychosocial Factors (5 = highest readiness). Mean TRAQ was compared with historical data on controls and other chronic conditions (t-tests) and correlated (Pearson) with Skin Knowledge and Psychosocial. Multivariable regression compared demographics and QoL with transition readiness. RESULTS: A total of 45 participants were enrolled (mean age 17.8 years, 67% female, 71% White; disorders of cornification [n = 31], ectodermal dysplasias [n = 7], epidermolysis bullosa [n = 4], tuberous sclerosis [n = 3]). Mean TRAQ (3.3 +- 0.9) was lower than controls (3.9; p < .001) and some chronic disorders (sickle cell [3.7; p < .05], type 1 diabetes [3.7; p < .01]), but higher than with spina bifida (2.8; p < .001) and congenital heart disease (2.9; p < .01). Mean Skin Knowledge was 4.2 +- 1.0, and mean Psychosocial was 3.4 +- 0.8. TRAQ correlated strongly with Skin Knowledge (r = .61; p < .05), but not Psychosocial (r = .12; p = .6). Ages 14-17 years versus 18-22 years and public versus private insurance predicted lower TRAQ scores. Poor DLQI predicted higher TRAQ and Skin Knowledge, but poor DLQI and CDLQI predicted lower Psychosocial. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents and young adults with genetic skin disorders demonstrated low transition readiness, especially among younger-aged and lower socioeconomic groups. We recommend a HCT intervention to improve health outcomes.
32628359	Four phase 1 trials to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of single and repeated dosing of SCO-101 in adult male and female volunteers.	SCO-101 (Endovion) was discontinued 20 years ago as a new drug under development against sickle cell anaemia. Data from the phase 1 studies remained unpublished. New data indicate that SCO-101 might be efficacious as add-on therapy in cancer. Thus, we report the results from the four phase 1 trials performed between 2001 and 2002. Adult volunteers received SCO-101 or placebo in four independent trials. Adverse events were recorded, and SCO-101 was determined for pharmacokinetic analysis. Ninety-two volunteers completed the trials. The most remarkable adverse effect was a transient and dose-dependent increase in unconjugated bilirubin. Plasma SCO-101 elimination was approximately log linear, with apparent oral clearances of between 315 and 2103 mL/h for single doses, and between 121 and 2433 mL/h at steady state following oral administration. There was a marked decrease in clearance with increasing dose, and for repeated dose versus single dose. Tmax was greater, and Cmax and AUC  were lower in the fed state compared to the fasted state. Exposure was equivalent in males and females and for African Americans and Caucasians. In conclusion, SCO-101 appears to be a safe drug with a predictable PK profile. Its efficacy as add-on to standard anticancer drugs has yet to be defined.
35093266	Process and strategies for patient engagement and outreach in the Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) community to promote clinical trial participation.	INTRODUCTION: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common inherited blood disorder in the United States. The Cure Sickle Cell Initiative (CureSCi) was created by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) to improve the lives of people with SCD by accelerating the advancement of safe and promising genetic therapies, engaging the SCD community and healthcare providers, and encouraging collaboration among stakeholders. CureSCi is a collaborative, patient-focused research effort that includes patients at every level of the Initiative. Patient engagement is a key component, particularly during the development of clinical trials. OBJECTIVE: To describe the processes and strategies utilized by the CureSCi to engage individuals living with SCD about genetic therapy clinical trials. METHODS: The CureSCi Patient Engagement team conducted nine Community Outreach visits in 2019, each of which was structured to include separate group interviews with patients and medical providers. A set of guidance questions was developed for each audience and the interviews lasted approximately 60 minutes. RESULTS: Patients were asked about their participation in a clinical trial, and approximately 50% had participated in a trial. SCD individuals reported trusting their medical provider to provide them with information relevant to trials. Medical providers emphasized the individual, family, and health aspects of SCD that warrant additional investigation. Providers reported barriers encountered by patients as transportation, childcare support, infertility, and trust in the healthcare system. CONCLUSION: Lessons learned from the community have helped to influence recommendations for clinical trial design and key messaging development for the Cure Sickle Cell Initiative.
38324722	Incidence and Risk Factors of Pain Crisis After Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation for Sickle Cell Disease.	Vaso-occlusive episodes (VOC) or pain crises are the commonest indications for hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for sickle cell disease (SCD). Elimination of pain crisis post-HCT is an important patient-centered outcome and may improve understanding of the natural history of pain syndromes in SCD. We examined de-identified records of 763 patients followed for a median of 36.7 months (0.3-168.6) with 69.6% patient's age at HCT <18 years, 83.3% patient's Karnofsky-Lansky Performance (KPS) score >= 90, overall survival 92.9%, event-free survival 72.4%, graft failure (GF) 22.4%, AGVHD 21.4%, CGVHD 27%, and pain crisis 8.65%. On unadjusted logistic regression, increased risk of pain crisis post-HCT was observed in patients with age at HCT >10 years (11-17 years [OR=9.43; 95% CI: 3.20, 27.79, p<0.0001], age >= 18 years [ OR=16.62; 95% CI: 5.85, 47.16, p<0.0001]), history of pain crisis 2 years before HCT [OR= 13.16, 95% CI: 4.08, 42.42, p<0.0001], alternate donors (haploidentical [OR= 4.80; 95% CI: 2.48, 9.31, p<0.0001], unrelated matched [OR= 2.71; 95% CI: 1.23, 5.97, p=0.0132], and mismatched unrelated [OR= 3.19; 95% CI: 1.44, 7.05, p=0.0041], and with GF [n= 41(5.37%), OR = 7.15; 95% CI: 4.20, 12.18., p<0.0001]. Pain crisis was less frequent with KPS >=90 [OR = 0.31; 95% CI: 0.18, 0.55, p<0.0001]. Multivariable logistic regression models confirmed age at HCT, KPS, graft type, donor type, history of VOC 2 yearspre-HCT, and GF as independent predictors of pain crisis post-HCT and generated predictive models and nomograms for pain crisis post-HCT for SCD which can support shared decision-making.
34898139	Biologic and Clinical Efficacy of LentiGlobin for Sickle Cell Disease.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease is characterized by the painful recurrence of vaso-occlusive events. Gene therapy with the use of LentiGlobin for sickle cell disease (bb1111; lovotibeglogene autotemcel) consists of autologous transplantation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells transduced with the BB305 lentiviral vector encoding a modified beta-globin gene, which produces an antisickling hemoglobin, HbAT87Q. METHODS: In this ongoing phase 1-2 study, we optimized the treatment process in the initial 7 patients in Group A and 2 patients in Group B with sickle cell disease. Group C was established for the pivotal evaluation of LentiGlobin for sickle cell disease, and we adopted a more stringent inclusion criterion that required a minimum of four severe vaso-occlusive events in the 24 months before enrollment. In this unprespecified interim analysis, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of LentiGlobin in 35 patients enrolled in Group C. Included in this analysis was the number of severe vaso-occlusive events after LentiGlobin infusion among patients with at least four vaso-occlusive events in the 24 months before enrollment and with at least 6 months of follow-up. RESULTS: As of February 2021, cell collection had been initiated in 43 patients in Group C; 35 received a LentiGlobin infusion, with a median follow-up of 17.3 months (range, 3.7 to 37.6). Engraftment occurred in all 35 patients. The median total hemoglobin level increased from 8.5 g per deciliter at baseline to 11 g or more per deciliter from 6 months through 36 months after infusion. HbAT87Q contributed at least 40% of total hemoglobin and was distributed across a mean (+-SD) of 85+-8% of red cells. Hemolysis markers were reduced. Among the 25 patients who could be evaluated, all had resolution of severe vaso-occlusive events, as compared with a median of 3.5 events per year (range, 2.0 to 13.5) in the 24 months before enrollment. Three patients had a nonserious adverse event related or possibly related to LentiGlobin that resolved within 1 week after onset. No cases of hematologic cancer were observed during up to 37.6 months of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: One-time treatment with LentiGlobin resulted in sustained production of HbAT87Q in most red cells, leading to reduced hemolysis and complete resolution of severe vaso-occlusive events.

33234442	Navigating decisional conflict as a family when facing the decision of stem cell transplant for a child or adolescent with sickle cell disease.	OBJECTIVE: Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) face unpredictable disease, with stem cell transplant being a curative treatment option with risks. The aim of this study was to describe the level and source of decisional conflict in families of children/adolescents with SCD facing a transplant decision. METHODS: A multiple-case study approach described decisional conflict in various SCD severity/donor risk decisional contexts. Cases included parents, child/adolescent with SCD, and sibling donor. The level and source of conflict was measured via O'Connor's Decisional Conflict Scale and analyzed using pattern-matching and cross-case synthesis. In-depth descriptions of conflict sources were obtained through thematic analysis of observation and interview data. RESULTS: Among 11 participants in four cases (i.e. family units) decisional conflict was not unique not to the decisional context. Conflict levels represented a level that can be linked with feeling unsure and decisional delay. The theme, 'navigating decisional conflict together', described how family units discussed uncertainties. CONCLUSION: Varying levels and sources of decisional conflict exist in pediatric patients with SCD and their families considering transplant. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: In our cases, decisional conflict and the transplant decision occurred at the family-level. Clinicians should encourage all family members to participate in discussions concerning transplant.
34544432	Vaso-occlusive crisis in sickle cell disease: a vicious cycle of secondary events.	Painful vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) remains the most common reason for presenting to the Emergency Department and hospitalization in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Although two new agents have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treating SCD, they both target to reduce the frequency of VOC. Results from studies investigating various approaches to treat and shorten VOC have so far been generally disappointing. In this paper, we will summarize the complex pathophysiology and downstream events of VOC and discuss the likely reasons for the disappointing results using monotherapy. We will put forward the rationale for exploring some of the currently available agents to either protect erythrocytes un-involved in the hemoglobin polymerization process from sickling induced by the secondary events, or a multipronged combination approach that targets the complex downstream pathways of VOC.
36996737	Non-pharmacological pain interventions for sickle cell crisis in pediatrics: A scoping review.	PROBLEM: Sickle cell crises (SCC) are recurrent, severe pain episodes experienced by people living with sickle cell disease (SCD). Non-pharmacological interventions have been recommended for SCC pain management however, little is known about the impact of these interventions on SCC pain. This scoping review aims to systematically identify evidence on the use and effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions for pain management during SCC in the pediatric population. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Studies were eligible if they are published in English and focusing on the use of any non-pharmacological interventions on pain during SCC in pediatric patients. Nine databases were searched including Medline, CINAHL and PsychInfo. Also, the reference lists of relevant studies were searched. SAMPLE: The database searching yielded 1517 studies. After the title and abstract screening, 1348 studies were excluded, and 169 full texts were retrieved and screened. One study was identified through handsearching. Finally, 27 articles were included in this scoping review. RESULTS: Across all studies, 27 different non-pharmacological interventions were identified. There were inconsistent results regarding the effectiveness of virtual reality, guided imagery, and cognitive-behavioral interventions in experimental studies. The most common interventions used at home were prayer, massage, and distraction. The main interventions used in hospitals were prayer and fluid intake, but this was explored by a few studies. CONCLUSION: Pediatric SCD patients use numerous non-pharmacological interventions to manage pain during SCC. However, the impact of many interventions on SCC pain has not been empirically investigated. IMPLICATIONS: Further research is necessary to establish the effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions on SCC pain.
35819456	Hematologist encounters among Medicaid patients who have sickle cell disease.	
37675899	Gene therapy for Hemoglobinopathies.	Beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease (SCD) are autosomal recessive disorders of red blood cells due to mutations in the adult ss-globin gene, with a worldwide diffusion. The severe forms of hemoglobinopathies are fatal if untreated, and allogeneic bone marrow transplantation can be offered to a limited proportion of patients. The unmet clinical need and the disease incidence have promoted the development of new genetic therapies based on the engineering of autologous hematopoietic stem cells. Here, the steps of ex vivo gene therapy development are reviewed along with results from clinical trials and recent new approaches employing cutting edge gene editing tools.
33399734	[Importance of early detection of hemoglobinopathies in the pediatric population in developing countries].	OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to spread awareness among health personnel about the importance of early detection of hemoglobinopathies since it is the most frequent monogenic recessive disorder worldwide. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Retrospective study of the results of capillary electropho resis (CE) of 152 patients aged between 0 and 18 years who were evaluated in 2017 due to suspected hemoglobinopathies in a University Hospital in Colombia. The information was collected from me dical records and the Hematology and Hemostasis Laboratory, ensuring data privacy and approved by the local Ethics Committee. RESULTS: Of 152 patients, 48.6% were aged between 7 and 18. The frequency of hemoglobinopathies was 42.7%. The most frequent hemoglobin variant was the sickle cell trait (Hb S) with 14.5%. The hematologist was the professional who most frequently requested CE. DISCUSSION: We found that hemoglobinopathies are usually diagnosed late in pediatric patients. This may favor complications and progression of the disease and increase healthcare costs. More information and education are required for general physicians and pediatricians in order to achieve early diagnosis.
34325680	Incidence and predictors of hospital readmission in children presenting with severe anaemia in Uganda and Malawi: a secondary analysis of TRACT trial data.	BACKGROUND: Severe anaemia (haemoglobin < 6 g/dL) is a leading cause of recurrent hospitalisation in African children. We investigated predictors of readmission in children hospitalised with severe anaemia in the TRACT trial (ISRCTN84086586) in order to identify potential future interventions. METHODS: Secondary analyses of the trial examined 3894 children from Uganda and Malawi surviving a hospital episode of severe anaemia. Predictors of all-cause readmission within 180 days of discharge were identified using multivariable regression with death as a competing risk. Groups of children with similar characteristics were identified using hierarchical clustering. RESULTS: Of the 3894 survivors 682 (18%) were readmitted; 403 (10%) had >=2 re-admissions over 180 days. Three main causes of readmission were identified: severe anaemia (n = 456), malaria (n = 252) and haemoglobinuria/dark urine syndrome (n = 165). Overall, factors increasing risk of readmission included HIV-infection (hazard ratio 2.48 (95% CI 1.63-3.78), p < 0.001); >=2 hospital admissions in the preceding 12 months (1.44(1.19-1.74), p < 0.001); history of transfusion (1.48(1.13-1.93), p = 0.005); and missing >=1 trial medication dose (proxy for care quality) (1.43 (1.21-1.69), p < 0.001). Children with uncomplicated severe anaemia (Hb 4-6 g/dL and no severity features), who never received a transfusion (per trial protocol) during the initial admission had a substantially lower risk of readmission (0.67(0.47-0.96), p = 0.04). Malaria (among children with no prior history of transfusion) (0.60(0.47-0.76), p < 0.001); younger-age (1.07 (1.03-1.10) per 1 year younger, p < 0.001) and known sickle cell disease (0.62(0.46-0.82), p = 0.001) also decreased risk of readmission. For anaemia re-admissions, gross splenomegaly and enlarged spleen increased risk by 1.73(1.23-2.44) and 1.46(1.18-1.82) respectively compared to no splenomegaly. Clustering identified four groups of children with readmission rates from 14 to 20%. The cluster with the highest readmission rate was characterised by very low haemoglobin (mean 3.6 g/dL). Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) predominated in two clusters associated with chronic repeated admissions or severe, acute presentations in largely undiagnosed SCD. The final cluster had high rates of malaria (78%), severity signs and very low platelet count, consistent with acute severe malaria. CONCLUSIONS: Younger age, HIV infection and history of previous hospital admissions predicted increased risk of readmission. However, no obvious clinical factors for intervention were identified. As missing medication doses was highly predictive, attention to care related factors may be important. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN ISRCTN84086586 .
33494879	Transfusion and Cellular Therapy in Pediatric Sickle Cell Disease.	Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion is critical in managing acute and chronic complications of sickle cell disease. Alloimmunization and iron overload remain significant complications of transfusion therapy and are minimized with prophylactic Rh and K antigen RBC matching and iron chelation. Matched sibling donor hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is a curative therapeutic option. Autologous hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-based gene therapy has recently shown great promise, for which obtaining sufficient HSCs is essential for success. This article discusses RBC transfusion indications and complications, transfusion support during HSCT, and HSC mobilization and collection for autologous HSCT with gene therapy.
35044697	Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is more prevalent in Duffy-null red blood cell transfusion in sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Resistance to malaria infection may be conferred by erythrocyte genetic variations including glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency and lack of Duffy antigens. In red blood cell (RBC) transfusion, G6PD deficiency may shorten transfusion survival. Because Duffy-null units are commonly transfused in sickle cell disease (SCD) due to antigen matching protocols, we examined whether Duffy-null donor RBC units have a higher prevalence of G6PD deficiency. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pediatric patients with SCD on chronic transfusion therapy were followed prospectively for multiple transfusions. RBC unit segments were collected to measure G6PD activity and RBC genotyping. The decline in donor hemoglobin (DeltaHbA) following transfusion was assessed from immediate posttransfusion estimates and HbA measurements approximately 1 month later. RESULTS: Of 564 evaluable RBC units, 59 (10.5%) were G6PD deficient (23 severe, 36 moderate deficiency); 202 (37.6%) units were Duffy-null. G6PD deficiency occurred in 40 (19.8%) Duffy-null units versus 15 (4.5%) Duffy-positive units (p < .0001). In univariate analysis, the fraction of Duffy-null RBC units per transfusion was associated with greater decline in HbA (p = .038); however, in multivariate analysis, severe G6PD deficiency (p = .0238) but not Duffy-null RBC (p = .0139) were associated with DeltaHbA. CONCLUSION: Selection of Duffy-null RBC units may result in shorter in vivo survival of transfused RBCs due to a higher likelihood of transfusing units from G6PD deficient donors.
36123668	Prevention and control of non-communicable diseases in antenatal, intrapartum, and postnatal care: a systematic scoping review of clinical practice guidelines since 2011.	BACKGROUND: Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are a leading cause of maternal mortality and morbidity worldwide. The World Health Organization is developing new recommendations focusing on the management of NCDs for pregnant, intrapartum, and postnatal women. Thus, to support the development of new guidelines and recommendations, we aimed to determine the availability, focus, and scope of recommendations of current guidelines for the management of NCDs during pregnancy, intrapartum, and postnatal period. METHODS: PubMed, Global Index Medicus, TRIP, and Guideline International Network databases were searched on 31 May 2021, to identify any NCD-related guidelines published between 2011 and 2021 with no language or country restrictions. Websites of 165 professional organizations were also searched. Characteristics of included guidelines were analyzed, and recommendations were extracted from guidelines of five high-priority NCD conditions (diabetes, chronic hypertension, respiratory conditions, hemoglobinopathies and sickle cell disease, and mental and substance use disorders). RESULTS: From 6026 citations and 165 websites, 405 guidelines were included of which 132 (33%) were pregnancy-specific and 285 (88%) were developed in high-income countries. Among pregnancy-specific guidelines, the most common conditions for which recommendations were provided were gestational diabetes, circulatory diseases, thyroid disorders, and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. For the five high-priority conditions, 47 guidelines were identified which provided 1834 recommendations, largely focused on antenatal care interventions (62%) such as early detection, screening tools, pharmacological treatment, and lifestyle education. Postnatal recommendations largely covered postnatal clinical assessments, lifestyle education, and breastfeeding. Health system recommendations largely covered multidisciplinary care teams and strengthening referral pathways. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a robust assessment of currently available guidelines and mapping of recommendations on NCD management within maternal health services, which will inform the scope of the World Health Organization's future guideline development activities. This study identified a need to develop guidelines that consider NCDs holistically, with an integrated approach to antenatal, intrapartum, and postnatal care, and that are relevant for resource-limited contexts. Any such guidelines should consider what interventions are most essential to improving outcomes for women with NCDs and their newborns, and how variations in quality of NCD-related care can be addressed.
34135108	Development of beta-globin gene correction in human hematopoietic stem cells as a potential durable treatment for sickle cell disease.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common serious monogenic disease with 300,000 births annually worldwide. SCD is an autosomal recessive disease resulting from a single point mutation in codon six of the beta-globin gene (HBB). Ex vivo beta-globin gene correction in autologous patient-derived hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) may potentially provide a curative treatment for SCD. We previously developed a CRISPR-Cas9 gene targeting strategy that uses high-fidelity Cas9 precomplexed with chemically modified guide RNAs to induce recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 6 (rAAV6)-mediated HBB gene correction of the SCD-causing mutation in HSPCs. Here, we demonstrate the preclinical feasibility, efficacy, and toxicology of HBB gene correction in plerixafor-mobilized CD34+ cells from healthy and SCD patient donors (gcHBB-SCD). We achieved up to 60% HBB allelic correction in clinical-scale gcHBB-SCD manufacturing. After transplant into immunodeficient NSG mice, 20% gene correction was achieved with multilineage engraftment. The long-term safety, tumorigenicity, and toxicology study demonstrated no evidence of abnormal hematopoiesis, genotoxicity, or tumorigenicity from the engrafted gcHBB-SCD drug product. Together, these preclinical data support the safety, efficacy, and reproducibility of this gene correction strategy for initiation of a phase 1/2 clinical trial in patients with SCD.
33895405	Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Outcomes among Medicaid and Privately Insured Patients with Sickle Cell Disease.	Compared with privately insured patients, recipients of Medicaid have been reported to have worse outcomes in several clinical conditions and following various surgical and medical procedures. However, the relationship between health insurance status and allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) outcomes among patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) is not well described. We sought to compare alloHCT outcomes between patients with SCD who underwent alloHCT while enrolled on Medicaid versus those who underwent alloHCT while covered by private health insurance. We conducted a retrospective multicenter study using data reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research. US patients enrolled on Medicaid or private insurance who underwent a first alloHCT for SCD between 2008 and 2018 were eligible for this study. The primary outcome was event-free survival (EFS), defined as time to death or graft failure. Secondary outcomes included overall survival (OS), graft failure, acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and chronic GVHD. Univariate analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method for EFS and OS. The proportion of patients with graft failure, acute GVHD, and/or chronic GVHD was calculated using the cumulative incidence estimator to accommodate competing risks (ie, death). Cox regression was used to identify factors associated with EFS, OS, graft failure, and acute and chronic GVHD. A total of 399 patients (Medicaid, n = 225; private insurance, n = 174) were included in this study. The median duration of follow-up was 34 months (range, 1.0 to 134.7 months) for the Medicaid group and 38.7 months (range, 0.3 to 139.3 months) for the private insurance group. Compared with the patients with private insurance, those on Medicaid had a significantly lower 3-year EFS (75.4% [95% confidence interval (CI), 69.4% to 81%] versus 82.2% [95% CI, 76.9% to 87.8%]; P = .0279) and a significantly higher 3-year cumulative incidence of graft failure (17.2% [95% CI, 12.5% to 22.5%] versus 10.5% [95% CI, 6.4% to 15.4%]; P = .0372). There were no significant between-group differences in 3-year OS (P = .6337) or in the cumulative incidence of acute GVHD (P = .4556) or chronic GVHD (P = .6878). Cox regression analysis after adjusting for other significant variables showed that the patients enrolled on Medicaid had a lower EFS (hazard ratio [HR], 2.36; 95% CI, 1.44 to 3.85; P = .0006) and a higher cumulative incidence of graft failure (HR, 2.57; 95% CI, 1.43 to 4.60; P = .0015), with no significant between-group differences in OS (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.47 to 2.07; P = .9765), acute GVHD (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.59 to 1.49; P = .7905), or cGVHD (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.65 to 1.48; P = .9331). That EFS is worse in patients on Medicaid compared with privately insured individuals following alloHCT for SCD provides the rationale for research to better understand the mechanisms by which insurance status impacts alloHCT outcomes among patients with SCD.

34823201	Prognostic factors associated with COVID-19 related severity in sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Equipoise exists regarding sickle cell disease (SCD) as a risk factor for COVID-19 disease severity and variables that increase risk of COVID-19 severity in SCD. Given our health system's large SCD patient catchment, we analyzed our own experience in this regard. STUDY METHODS: Retrospective analysis of the clinical course and factors associated with need for hospitalization and ICU admission of SCD patients diagnosed with COVID-19 through the Northwell Health system from March 1 to Dec 31, 2020. RESULTS: Of 1098 patients with SCD, 3.3% were diagnosed with COVID-19. Overall rates of hospitalization, ICU admission, cohort mortality, and in-hospital mortality were 80%, 19%, 2.5%,and 3.1%, respectively. By multivariable analysis, hospitalization risk was decreased by 60% for every 1 g/dL increase in admission Hb. ICU admission risk was increased by 84% as a health care worker; increased by 45% for every 1000/uL increase in admission immature granulocyte count; and decreased by 17% with hydroxyurea use. DISCUSSION: High hospitalization rates are compatible with worsened severity upon COVID-19 infection in SCD compared to the general population. Patients should be placed on hydroxyurea to increase their Hb and perhaps lower their neutrophil counts. Health care workers with SCD may warrant special safety precautions.
34981144	The pharmacokinetic and safety profile of single-dose deferiprone in subjects with sickle cell disease.	Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) who undergo repeated blood transfusions often develop iron overload. Deferiprone (Ferriprox ) is an oral iron chelator indicated for the treatment of transfusional iron overload due to thalassemia syndromes and has been recently approved as a treatment for iron overload in adult and pediatric patients with SCD and other anemias. The present study aims to characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of deferiprone (DFP) in adult subjects with SCD. In this phase I, open-label study, subjects with SCD were administered a single 1500 mg dose of DFP. Blood and urine samples were collected for PK assessments of DFP and its main metabolite, deferiprone 3-O-glucuronide (DFP-G). Eight subjects were enrolled and completed the study. Following drug administration, serum levels of DFP and DFP-G rose to maximum concentrations at 1.0 and 2.8 h post-dose, respectively. The half-lives of DFP and DFP-G were 1.5 and 1.6 h, respectively. The majority of administered drug was metabolized and excreted as DFP-G, with less than 4% excreted unchanged in urine up to 10 h post-dose. Subjects received a safety assessment 7 (+- 3) days post-dose. Two subjects reported mild adverse events unrelated to the study drug, and no other safety concerns were reported. The PK profile of DFP in SCD subjects is consistent with previous reports in healthy adult volunteers, suggesting no special dosing adjustments are indicated for this population. These findings provide valuable insight for treating iron overload in patients with SCD, who have limited chelation therapy treatment options (trial registration number: NCT01835496, date of registration: April 19, 2013).
33638018	Stroke and presence of patent foramen ovale in sickle cell disease.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited monogenic hemoglobinopathy characterized by formation of sickle erythrocytes under conditions of deoxygenation. Sickle erythrocytes can lead to thrombus formation and vaso-occlusive episodes that may result in hemolytic anemia, pain crisis and multiple organ damage. Moreover, SCD is characterized by endothelial damage, increased inflammatory response, platelet activation and aggravation, and activation of both the intrinsic and the extrinsic coagulation pathways. Cerebrovascular events constitute an important clinical complication of SCD. Children with SCD have a 300-fold higher risk of acute stroke and by the age of 45 about 25% of patients have suffered an overt stoke. Management and prevention of stroke in patients with SCD is not well defined. Moreover, the presence of patent foramen ovale (PFO) increases the risk of the occurrence of an embolic cerebrovascular event. The role of PFO closure and antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy has not been well investigated. Moreover, during COVID-19 pandemic and taking into account the increased rates of thrombotic events and the difficulties in blood transfusion, management of SCD patients is even more challenging and difficult, since data are scarce regarding stroke occurrence and management in this specific population in the COVID-19 era. This review focuses on pathophysiology of stroke in patients with SCD and possible treatment strategies in the presence of PFO.
33812445	[Progress in Gene Therapy of Sickle Cell Disease Based on Hemoglobin F--Review].	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a single gene genetic disease, which seriously threatens the life span and quality of patients. On the basis of the pathogenesis of SCD and the alternative therapy based on fetal hemoglobin F (HbF), the research progress of transcription factors involved in the regulation of HbF gene expression, such as BCL11A, ZBTB7A, KLF-1, c-MYB and SOX6, as well as the application of CRISPR / Cas9, TALEN, zinc finger nuclease and other gene editing technologies in this field has been made, providing a solid theoretical basis for the exploration of new treatment schemes for beta- like hemoglobin diseases, such as sickle cell disease and beta- thalassemia.
33427035	Safe and Effective In Vivo Targeting and Gene Editing in Hematopoietic Stem Cells: Strategies for Accelerating Development.	On May 11, 2020, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (Gates Foundation) held an exploratory expert scientific roundtable to inform an NIH-Gates Foundation collaboration on the development of scalable, sustainable, and accessible HIV and sickle cell disease (SCD) therapies based on in vivo gene editing of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). A particular emphasis was on how such therapies could be developed for low-resource settings in sub-Saharan Africa. Paula Cannon, PhD, of the University of Southern California and Hans-Peter Kiem, MD, PhD, of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center served as roundtable cochairs. Welcoming remarks were provided by the leadership of NIH, NHLBI, and BMGF, who cited the importance of assessing the state of the science and charting a path toward finding safe, effective, and durable gene-based therapies for HIV and SCD. These remarks were followed by three sessions in which participants heard presentations on and discussed the therapeutic potential of modified HSCs, leveraging HSC biology and differentiation, and in vivo HSC targeting approaches. This roundtable serves as the beginning of an ongoing discussion among NIH, the Gates Foundation, research and patient communities, and the public at large. As this collaboration progresses, these communities will be engaged as we collectively navigate the complex scientific and ethical issues surrounding in vivo HSC targeting and editing. Summarized excerpts from each of the presentations are given hereunder, reflecting the individual views and perspectives of each presenter.
38066894	The range of haploidentical transplant protocols in sickle cell disease: all haplos are not created equally.	The ideal curative therapy for sickle cell disease (SCD) must be applicable across all ages and include individuals with strokes and preexisting heart, lung, and kidney disease. Myeloablative, matched sibling donor hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) for children with SCD has shown excellent outcomes over the past 3 decades but has been restricted due to the limited availability of a human leukocyte antigen-matched sibling donor (10%-15%) and increased treatment-related death in adults with myeloablative conditioning. To overcome these 2 significant barriers to curative therapy in SCD, related haploidentical HCT has become an active area of research. The use of related haploidentical donors (first- and second-degree relatives) increases the donor pool to at least 90% of those eligible across the life span. Importantly, most adults, even with strokes or significant comorbidities, can tolerate the nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen without treatment-related death. Since 2013, at least 3 related haploidentical HCT strategies have emerged as potential curative therapies for SCD: (1) a nonmyeloablative, T-cell replete, bone marrow transplant with thiotepa and posttransplant cyclophosphamide with a goal of complete donor chimerism; (2) a nonmyeloablative, in vivo T-cell depletion, using peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) with a goal of stable mixed donor-recipient chimerism; and (3) a myeloablative, ex vivo T-cell depletion using PBSCs and advanced-technology graft manipulation, with a goal of complete donor chimerism. We review the similarities, differences, outcomes, and gaps in knowledge with these 3 haploidentical HCT approaches for SCD.

35788790	Sickle Cell Disease: A Review.	Importance: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited disorder of hemoglobin, characterized by formation of long chains of hemoglobin when deoxygenated within capillary beds, resulting in sickle-shaped red blood cells, progressive multiorgan damage, and increased mortality. An estimated 300 000 infants are born annually worldwide with SCD. Most individuals with SCD live in sub-Saharan Africa, India, the Mediterranean, and Middle East; approximately 100 000 individuals with SCD live in the US. Observations: SCD is diagnosed through newborn screening programs, where available, or when patients present with unexplained severe atraumatic pain or normocytic anemia. In SCD, sickling and hemolysis of red blood cells result in vaso-occlusion with associated ischemia. SCD is characterized by repeated episodes of severe acute pain and acute chest syndrome, and by other complications including stroke, chronic pain, nephropathy, retinopathy, avascular necrosis, priapism, and leg ulcers. In the US, nearly all children with SCD survive to adulthood, but average life expectancy remains 20 years less than the general population, with higher mortality as individuals transition from pediatric to adult-focused health care systems. Until 2017, hydroxyurea, which increases fetal hemoglobin and reduces red blood cell sickling, was the only disease-modifying therapy available for SCD and remains first-line therapy for most individuals with SCD. Three additional therapies, L-glutamine, crizanlizumab, and voxelotor, have been approved as adjunctive or second-line agents. In clinical trials, L-glutamine reduced hospitalization rates by 33% and mean length of stay from 11 to 7 days compared with placebo. Crizanlizumab reduced pain crises from 2.98 to 1.63 per year compared with placebo. Voxelotor increased hemoglobin by at least 1 g/dL, significantly more than placebo (51% vs 7%). Hematopoietic stem cell transplant is the only curative therapy, but it is limited by donor availability, with best results seen in children with a matched sibling donor. While SCD is characterized by acute and chronic pain, patients are not more likely to develop addiction to pain medications than the general population. Conclusions and Relevance: In the US, approximately 100 000 people have SCD, which is characterized by hemolytic anemia, acute and chronic pain, acute chest syndrome; increased incidence of stroke, nephropathy, and retinopathy; and a life span that is 20 years shorter than the general population. While hydroxyurea is first-line therapy for SCD, L-glutamine, crizanlizumab, and voxelotor have been approved in the US since 2017 as adjunctive or second-line treatments, and hematopoietic stem cell transplant with a matched sibling donor is now standard care for severe disease.
37581462	Improved Quality of Life of Patients With Sickle Cell Disease after Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplant: Another Indication for Transplant.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is frequently inherited worldwide. The severity of SCD ranges from mild to severe, and the disease involves multiple complications, including pulmonary hypertension, stroke, recurrent vaso-occlusive crises, end-organ damage, and an increased mortality risk. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is a potentially curative option for patients with SCD. OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY: The objective was to assess the quality of life of adolescent and adult patients with SCD receiving HCT pre-and post-transplant. METHODS: An analytical cross-sectional study was conducted. Patients with SCD with at least one year of follow-up after HCT were interviewed to assess their quality of life pre-and post-transplant. This study was conducted at the Transplant Center of King Abdulaziz Medical City, Riyadh. The participants were identified through non-probability consecutive sampling. The FACT-G questionnaire was used to assess the quality of life domains. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients were included. The median age of the respondents was 32 +- 6.3 years, and 16 were male (51.6%). The most frequent indication for stem cell transplantation (58%) was a vaso-occlusive crisis. The mean FACT-G scores pre- and post-transplantation were 55.2 +- 18.17 and 91 +- 14.58, respectively. The mean number of annual ER visits was significantly reduced from 27.3 pre-transplant to 6.6 post-transplant (P-value = 0.006). Of the respondents, 51.6% experienced no severe complications post-transplantation, and most (93.5%) reported improved quality of life. CONCLUSION: HCT significantly improved the quality of life of adult patients with SCD, with improvements in most FACT-G score domains. Although it was not measured by the FACT-G, the frequency of ER visits and hospital admissions were reduced significantly post-transplant, reflecting an improvement in the quality of life and a reduction in the cost of therapy for patients with SCD.

36053825	Converting adults with sickle cell disease from full agonist opioids to buprenorphine: A reliable method with safety and early evidence of reduced acute care utilization.	Buprenorphine, a novel opioid with complex pharmacology, is effective for treating pain and is qualitatively safer than high-dose full agonist opioid therapy; but transitioning to buprenorphine can be technically complex and carries some risk of precipitated withdrawal. We report our clinic's experience converting 36 patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) from full agonist opioids to buprenorphine using a method developed in the past 10 years. Thirty of these patients were induced using a standard outpatient protocol and six were induced during medical admissions. Typically, patients were on high-dose chronic opioid therapy (COT) with inadequate response, and often with very high acute care utilization. Unlike prior case series, the method of induction, dosing, and management of withdrawal are detailed, as are post-induction adverse events. There were seven adverse events in the first 3 days following standard induction, and two of which were judged to be definitely related to the induction but none with any lasting sequelae. At 6 months follow-up, five participants had discontinued buprenorphine (16.67%), and overall acute care visits dropped from a mean of 10.50 (SD 11.35) in the 6 months pre-induction to 2.89 (SD 3.40) in the 6 months post-induction. In an appropriately interdisciplinary care setting, buprenorphine shows promise as a safe alternative to COT with early evidence of benefit for high-utilizing patients with SCD.
37147756	Mechanism underlying Fanmugua () leaf multicomponent synergistic therapy for anemia: data mining based on hematopoietic network.	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the underlying mechanism of Fanmugua (Fructus Caricae) Leaf (CPL) multicomponent synergistic therapy for anemia. METHODS: The components were identified in the literature. Six databases were searched for targets of CPL. Enrichment analysis was used to determine the targets associated with anemia and in bone marrow. Based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database, pathways and targets related to hematopoiesis were obtained. The key targets were obtained by protein-protein interaction analysis. Molecular docking was used to analyze the binding ability of key targets and active components. Bone marrow cells were used as an experimental model to verify the drug efficacy. RESULTS: A total of 139 components and 1868 targets of CPL were retrieved from the literature. By disease enrichment analysis, 543 targets for hemorrhagic anemia, 223 targets for aplastic anemia, and 126 targets for sickle cell anemia were obtained. Target organ enrichment yielded 27, 29, and 20 targets of bone marrow. Based on KEGG pathway enrichment, a total of 47 shared hematopoietic pathways and 42 related targets were found. The key targets were vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), interleukin 10 (IL-10), platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM1), C-C motif chemokine 2 (CCL2), and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1). The CPL active components included ursolic acid, quercetin, and hesperidin. The expression of VEGFA was significantly increased after CPL treatment. Quercetin and ursolic acid acted on VEGFA. Quercetin and Hesperidin acted on VCAM1. Quercetin acted on IL-10, CCL2, VCAM1, and VEGFA. Cell experiments revealed that CPL could promote the proliferation and migration of bone marrow cells. CONCLUSIONS: CPL has the synergistic efficacy of treating anemia through multiple components, targets, and pathways.
32629525	Use of dual lumen ports for red blood cell exchange: A comparison of adults and children with sickle cell disease.	PURPOSE: Sickle cell patients receiving chronic RBC exchange require a form of long-term central venous access if peripheral access is inadequate. In adults, dual lumen (DL) ports have been utilized but associated with greater procedure complications and duration when compared to other forms of access. In the pediatric sickle cell population, the use of DL ports for RBC exchange has not been well described. In this retrospective cohort study, RBC exchange procedures utilizing DL ports in the pediatric vs adult sickle cell population were compared. METHODS: Medical records were reviewed for 685 RBC exchange procedures performed on 25 patients (11 pediatric and 14 adult) between November 2014 to November 2018. Patient-level characteristics and outcomes were compared between pediatric and adult patients using the Fisher-exact and Wilcoxon-rank sum test. Linear/logistic regression models examined procedure-level parameters and port characteristics with adjustment for clustering. RESULTS: Compared to adults, pediatric patients had slower average maximum inlet speed (42 vs 53 mL/min, P < .01), but shorter procedure time (60 vs 75 minutes, P < .01) and lower rate of access alarms (1% vs 11%, P < .01). Overall, 0.29 thrombotic events per 1000 port days and 0.04 infections per 1000 port days were observed. CONCLUSION: For adult and pediatric sickle cell patients, a DL port provides a viable option for RBC exchange. In comparison to adults, pediatric procedures with a DL port will typically be shorter and with less procedural complications due to smaller blood volumes and lower flow requirements.
38635540	Decreased risk of underdosing with continuous infusion versus intermittent administration of cefotaxime in patients with sickle cell disease and acute chest syndrome.	OBJECTIVE: Underdosing of antibiotics is common in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). We hypothesized that in critically-ill patients with SCD receiving cefotaxime during acute chest syndrome, the continuous infusion may outperform the intermittent administration in achieving pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic targets. DESIGN: Prospective before-after study. SETTINGS: Intensive-care unit of a French teaching hospital and sickle cell disease referral center. PATIENTS: Sixty consecutive episodes of severe acute chest syndrome in 58 adult patients with sickle cell disease. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were treated with intermittent administration during the first period (April 2016 -April 2018) and with continuous infusion during the second period (May 2018 -August 2019). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We included 60 episodes of acute chest syndrome in 58 patients (29 [25-34] years, 37/58 (64%) males). Daily dose of cefotaxime was similar between groups (59 [48-88] vs. 61 [57-64] mg/kg/day, p = 0.84). Most patients (>75%) presented a glomerular hyperfiltration with no difference between groups (p = 0.25). More patients had a cefotaxime trough level >=2 mg/L with continuous infusion than intermittent administration: 28 (93%) vs. 5 (16%), p<0.001. The median residual concentration was higher in the continuous infusion than intermittent administration group: 10.5 [7.4-13.3] vs. 0 [0-0] mg/L, p<0.001. No infection relapse was observed in the entire cohort. Hospital length of stay was similar between groups. CONCLUSION: As compared to intermittent administration, continuous infusion of cefotaxime maximizes the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters in patients with SCD. The clinical outcome did not differ between the two administration methods; however, the study was underpowered to detect such a difference.
33243953	Treatment of recalcitrant chronic leg ulcer in a known sickle cell anaemia patient using honey and fresh hbaa red cell concentrate in a Nigerian secondary healthcare facility.	Sickle hemoglobin (HbS) formed by the point mutation in the genetic code of beta-globin chain leading to valine substituting glutamic acid at position 6 of the beta-chain. The resultant sickle cell disease (SCD) characterized by occlusion of microvasculature by red blood cells is associated with multiple organ pathologies. One of such complications is chronic leg ulcers. We report a case of chronic leg ulcer, in a known sickle cell anemia patient, which did not respond to the wound dressing methods at the hospital's disposal. The ulcer was successfully treated using standard operative procedure (S.O.P) in wound care, applying local honey, and use of blood transfusion. EA was a 20-year-old university undergraduate who was admitted to April 2019 in Central Hospital Benin City with chronic leg ulcer of 1 year duration. She was also anemic with hemoglobin concentration of 3.0 g/dl (packed cell volume 15%). The wound was dressed with local honey, and anemia corrected with blood transfusion using concentrated red cells lacking the HbS trait. There was a progressive improvement in the healing of the ulcer with total closure after 4 months of treatment. Maintenance and follow-up measures were instituted to prevent reoccurrence. This report showed that honey has remarkable properties in promoting wound healing. Its usage in combination with transfusion of HbA red blood cells to manage chronic leg ulcers in SCD patients is advocated. However, this calls for further studies and research.
35543673	Influence of user-centered clinical decision support on pediatric blood product ordering errors.	BACKGROUND: Children are at increased risk from transfusion-related medical errors. Clinical decision support (CDS) can enhance pediatric providers' decision-making regarding transfusion practices including indications, volume, rate, and special processing instructions. Our objective was to use CDS in a pediatric health system to reduce:blood product-related safety events from ordering errors;special processing ordering errors for patients with T-cell dysfunction, sickle cell disease (SCD), or thalassemia;transfusions administered faster than 5 mL/kg/h. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this single-center before and after quality improvement study, we evaluated how user-centered design of pediatric blood product orders influenced pediatric transfusion practices and outcomes. Safety events were identified through active and passive surveillance. Other clinically relevant outcomes were identified through electronic health record queries. RESULTS: Blood product-related safety events from ordering errors did not change significantly from the baseline period (6 events, 0.4 per month, from 1/1/2018-3/27/2019) to the intervention period (1 event, 0.1 per month, from 3/28/2019-12/31/2019; rate ratio: 0.27 [0.01-2.25]). Packed red blood cell (PRBC) and platelet orders for patients with T-cell dysfunction that did not specify irradiation decreased significantly from 488/12,359 (3.9%) to 204/6,711 (3.0%, risk ratio: 0.77 [0.66-0.90]). PRBC orders for patients with SCD or thalassemia that did not specify phenotypically similar units fell from 386/2,876 (13.4%) to 57/1,755 (3.2%, risk ratio: 0.24 [0.18-0.32]). Transfusions administered faster than 5 mL/kg/h decreased from 4,112/14,641 (28.1%) to 2,125/9,263 (22.9%, risk ratio: 0.82 [0.78-0.85]). DISCUSSION: User-centered design of CDS for pediatric blood product orders significantly reduced special processing ordering errors and inappropriate transfusion rates. Larger studies are needed to evaluate the impact on safety events.
34847228	Deferiprone vs deferoxamine for transfusional iron overload in SCD and other anemias: a randomized, open-label noninferiority study.	Many people with sickle cell disease (SCD) or other anemias require chronic blood transfusions, which often causes iron overload that requires chelation therapy. The iron chelator deferiprone is frequently used in individuals with thalassemia syndromes, but data in patients with SCD are limited. This open-label study assessed the efficacy and safety of deferiprone in patients with SCD or other anemias receiving chronic transfusion therapy. A total of 228 patients (mean age: 16.9 [range, 3-59] years; 46.9% female) were randomized to receive either oral deferiprone (n = 152) or subcutaneous deferoxamine (n = 76). The primary endpoint was change from baseline at 12 months in liver iron concentration (LIC), assessed by R2* magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The least squares mean (standard error) change in LIC was -4.04 (0.48) mg/g dry weight for deferiprone vs -4.45 (0.57) mg/g dry weight for deferoxamine, with noninferiority of deferiprone to deferoxamine demonstrated by analysis of covariance (least squares mean difference 0.40 [0.56]; 96.01% confidence interval, -0.76 to 1.57). Noninferiority of deferiprone was also shown for both cardiac T2* MRI and serum ferritin. Rates of overall adverse events (AEs), treatment-related AEs, serious AEs, and AEs leading to withdrawal did not differ significantly between the groups. AEs related to deferiprone treatment included abdominal pain (17.1% of patients), vomiting (14.5%), pyrexia (9.2%), increased alanine transferase (9.2%) and aspartate transferase levels (9.2%), neutropenia (2.6%), and agranulocytosis (0.7%). The efficacy and safety profiles of deferiprone were acceptable and consistent with those seen in patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia. This trial study was registered at www://clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT02041299.
38642304	Expert consensus on the management of infusion-related reactions (IRRs) in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) receiving crizanlizumab: a RAND/UCLA modified Delphi panel.	Crizanlizumab, a monoclonal antibody against P-selectin, has been shown to reduce vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs) compared to placebo in patients >= 16 years with sickle cell disease (SCD). However, there have been rare reports of patients experiencing severe pain and subsequent complications within 24 hours of crizanlizumab infusions. These events are defined as infusion-related reactions (IRRs). Informed by current literature and clinical experience, a group of content experts developed clinical guidelines for the management of IRRs in patients with SCD. We used the RAND/University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) modified Delphi panel method, a valid, reproducible technique for achieving consensus. We present our recommendations for managing IRRs, which depend on patient characteristics including: prior history of IRRs to other monoclonal antibodies or medications, changes to crizanlizumab infusion rate and patient monitoring, pain severity relative to patient's typical SCD crises, and severe allergic symptoms. These recommendations outline how to evaluate and manage IRRs in patients receiving crizanlizumab. Future research should validate this guidance using clinical data and identify patients at risk for these IRRs.
35972997	Reassessing the Need for Preoperative Transfusions in Sickle Cell Disease Patients with an Elevated Baseline Hemoglobin-a Retrospective Study.	BACKGROUND: Current guidelines recommend a preoperative hemoglobin of 10.0 g/dL in patients with sickle cell disease [SCD], however, this threshold continues to be an area of controversy. Previous studies demonstrating the benefits of preoperative transfusions have largely not captured patients with elevated baseline hemoglobin, in part due to low hydroxyurea uptake and exclusion of nonhemoglobin SS SCD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients with SCD <18 years of age undergoing low and medium-risk procedures at 2 academic medical centers in Canada between 2007 and 2017. The primary objective was to study the association of preoperative transfusion on postoperative complications in patients with SCD with baseline hemoglobin between 9.0 and 10.0 g/dL. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the adjusted effect of preoperative transfusion on the risk of developing postoperative complications. RESULTS: In all, 159 procedures in patients with hemoglobin <9.0 g/dL [Hb<9.0] and 173 procedures in patients with hemoglobin between 9.0 and 10.0 g/dL [Hb9.0-10.0] were analyzed. In the absence of preoperative transfusion, Hb9.0-10.0 patients had lower overall complications [23% vs. 34%] compared with Hb<9.0 patients [OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.12-0.72, P=0.008]. In total, 75% of Hb<9.0 and 21% of Hb9.0-10.0 patients received a preoperative simple transfusion. Transfusion was associated with increased risk of postoperative complications in Hb9.0-10.0 [OR 3.02, 95% CI 1.26-7.23, P=0.013], but not Hb<9.0 patients [OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.28-1.45, P=0.30]. CONCLUSIONS: Simple transfusion may not be warranted in Hb9.0-10.0 patients undergoing low-risk procedures. Prospective studies validating these findings are needed.
33208686	Real-world efficacy and safety of direct-acting antiviral drugs in patients with chronic hepatitis C and inherited blood disorders.	BACKGROUND: Patients with inherited blood disorders (IBLD) have a high risk of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The aim of this work was to assess the efficacy and safety of HCV direct-acting antiviral (DAA)-based treatment in patients with IBLD and chronic HCV infection. METHODS: Twenty-seven patients (25 with sickle cell disease, 1 with beta-thalassemia and 1 with hemoglobin D-Punjab), including 3 with compensated cirrhosis, were included. They were treated with sofosbuvir in combination with ribavirin, daclatasvir, ledipasvir, or velpatasvir or with grazoprevir/elbasvir for 8 or 12 weeks. In the case of treatment failure, in-vitro assessment of resistance-associated substitutions (RASs) and full-length genome sequence analysis by means of deep sequencing were performed. RESULTS: Treatment was safe and well-tolerated and there were no drug discontinuations due to DAA-related adverse events. Twenty-five out of the 27 patients (93%) achieved sustained virological response 12 weeks post-treatment. One patient discontinued after 18 days due to adverse events unrelated to the antiviral treatment. One patient infected with 'unusual' genotype 2 subtype 2m relapsed. Subtype 2m naturally carries the NS5A L31M RAS. In a genotype 2a subgenomic replicon model, L31M increased daclatasvir effective concentration 50% (EC50) by 97-fold, but velpatasvir EC50 by only 3-fold, without altering the replication capacity. This patient was successfully retreated with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for 12 weeks. CONCLUSION: DAA-based regimens are well tolerated and highly efficacious in patients with chronic hepatitis C and IBLD in the real-world setting. Thus, DAA-based antiviral treatment should be prioritized in this thus far neglected population of HCV-infected patients.
32618413	Hemoglobin A1c and fructosamine correlate in a patient with sickle cell disease and diabetes on chronic transfusion therapy.	In patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and diabetes mellitus (DM), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c ) is unreliable and the American Diabetes Association recommends monitoring long-term glycemia by measuring serum glucose, but use of serum fructosamine (SF), a measurement independent of red cell lifespan, has been reported. SF as a screen for DM in SCD, however, is not standardized and its relationship to serum glucose has not been validated. Further, screening for DM was not adequately addressed in the 2014 National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) guidelines for SCD management. Blood transfusions, an important treatment for some patients with SCD, can also impact HbA1c . We present a case of a patient with SCD and cystic fibrosis-related diabetes on monthly chronic transfusions therapy (CTT) who had well-correlated "steady state" HbA1c and SF levels over time, suggesting for the first time these markers may actually be useful when following long-term glycemic control in patients with SCD on CTT programs.

37449655	Pregnancy and assisted reproductive technology use in Australian female transfusion-dependent haemoglobinopathy patients: a 20-year retrospective analysis.	BACKGROUND: In the last few decades, the life expectancy of patients with transfusion-dependent thalassaemia (TDT) and sickle cell disease (SCD) has improved significantly, in part because of improved iron chelation. Fertility challenges and pregnancy complications have historically limited reproductive options in this group; however, improved multi-disciplinary care has made infertility a chronic disease complication requiring attention. Despite this, there are very few reports and no Australian data describing fertility and pregnancy outcomes in this population. AIMS: To identify the rate of assisted reproductive technologies (ART) utilisation in our female transfusion-dependent haemoglobinopathy patients and to establish the nature of maternal and neonatal complications in this cohort. METHODS: A 20-year retrospective analysis (1997-2017) at an Australian centre captured data on conception rates, use of assisted reproductive techniques (ART), and pregnancy and neonatal outcomes in female transfusion-dependent haemoglobinopathy patients. RESULTS: Conception was attempted in 14 women (11 TDT and three SCD) during the study period. A total of 28 pregnancies resulting in 25 live births were recorded. ART supported 13 conceptions. A positive association was not identified between elevated mean serum ferritin and ART use; however, all patients with an established diagnosis of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) required ART. Maternal complications included gestational diabetes mellitus and post-partum haemorrhage. There were no cardiac complications. Two-thirds of women underwent lower segment caesarean section, with prematurity complicating 20% of births. There were no neonatal or maternal deaths. CONCLUSION: Pregnancy is an achievable goal for women with transfusion-dependent haemoglobinopathies, although the support of ART may be required in a subset of patients.
36412212	Risk of vaso-occlusive episodes in patients with sickle cell disease exposed to systemic corticosteroids: a comprehensive review.	INTRODUCTION: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most frequent inherited disorder in the world. It is caused by a single amino acid mutation on the beta-globin chain, which lead to red blood cell deformation, haemolysis, and chronic inflammation. Clinical consequences are vaso-occlusives crisis, acute chest syndrome, thrombosis, infection, and chronic endothelial injury. AREAS COVERED: Corticosteroids are an old therapeutic class, that are inexpensive and widely available, which can be administered in different forms. Their adverse effects are numerous and well-known. This class could appear to be useful in SCD treatment due to its anti-inflammatory effect. Moreover, corticosteroids remain an essential therapeutic class for many indications, besides SCD. Although specific adverse effects of corticosteroids have been suspected in SCD patients for decades, recent papers has reported strong evidence of specific and severe adverse effects in this population. Based on a literature review, we will discuss pathophysiological considerations, consequences, and practical use of corticosteroids in SCD. EXPERT OPINION: High corticosteroid doses, for any indication , induce vaso-occlusive crises, acute chest syndrome, and re-hospitalization in patients with SCD. There is no evidence of any benefits of corticosteroid use in the SCD acute events. Prevention by hydroxyurea and/or red blood cell transfusion or exchange should be discussed when corticosteroid use is indispensable.
37646679	CRISPR-Cas9 Editing of the HBG1 and HBG2 Promoters to Treat Sickle Cell Disease.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease is caused by a defect in the beta-globin subunit of adult hemoglobin. Sickle hemoglobin polymerizes under hypoxic conditions, producing deformed red cells that hemolyze and cause vaso-occlusion that results in progressive organ damage and early death. Elevated fetal hemoglobin levels in red cells protect against complications of sickle cell disease. OTQ923, a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9-edited CD34+ hematopoietic stem- and progenitor-cell (HSPC) product, has a targeted disruption of the HBG1 and HBG2 (gamma-globin) gene promoters that increases fetal hemoglobin expression in red-cell progeny. METHODS: We performed a tiling CRISPR-Cas9 screen of the HBG1 and HBG2 promoters by electroporating CD34+ cells obtained from healthy donors with Cas9 complexed with one of 72 guide RNAs, and we assessed the fraction of fetal hemoglobin-immunostaining erythroblasts (F cells) in erythroid-differentiated progeny. The gRNA resulting in the highest level of F cells (gRNA-68) was selected for clinical development. We enrolled participants with severe sickle cell disease in a multicenter, phase 1-2 clinical study to assess the safety and adverse-effect profile of OTQ923. RESULTS: In preclinical experiments, CD34+ HSPCs (obtained from healthy donors and persons with sickle cell disease) edited with CRISPR-Cas9 and gRNA-68 had sustained on-target editing with no off-target mutations and produced high levels of fetal hemoglobin after in vitro differentiation or xenotransplantation into immunodeficient mice. In the study, three participants received autologous OTQ923 after myeloablative conditioning and were followed for 6 to 18 months. At the end of the follow-up period, all the participants had engraftment and stable induction of fetal hemoglobin (fetal hemoglobin as a percentage of total hemoglobin, 19.0 to 26.8%), with fetal hemoglobin broadly distributed in red cells (F cells as a percentage of red cells, 69.7 to 87.8%). Manifestations of sickle cell disease decreased during the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: CRISPR-Cas9 disruption of the HBG1 and HBG2 gene promoters was an effective strategy for induction of fetal hemoglobin. Infusion of autologous OTQ923 into three participants with severe sickle cell disease resulted in sustained induction of red-cell fetal hemoglobin and clinical improvement in disease severity.

33855970	Genetic therapies for the first molecular disease.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a monogenic disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of severe bone pain, multi-organ failure, and early mortality. Although medical progress over the past several decades has improved clinical outcomes and offered cures for many affected individuals living in high-income countries, most SCD patients still experience substantial morbidity and premature death. Emerging technologies to manipulate somatic cell genomes and insights into the mechanisms of developmental globin gene regulation are generating potentially transformative approaches to cure SCD by autologous hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation. Key components of current approaches include ethical informed consent, isolation of patient HSCs, in vitro genetic modification of HSCs to correct the SCD mutation or circumvent its damaging effects, and reinfusion of the modified HSCs following myelotoxic bone marrow conditioning. Successful integration of these components into effective therapies requires interdisciplinary collaborations between laboratory researchers, clinical caregivers, and patients. Here we summarize current knowledge and research challenges for each key component, emphasizing that the best approaches have yet to be developed.
38069808	High hydroxyurea usage in sickle cell anemia regardless of patient demographics.	Hydroxyurea is highly effective in sickle cell disease, but it is still underutilized. Reports of hydroxyurea utilization largely use Medicaid data, and socioeconomics is often cited as a barrier. To address whether patient demographics influenced the high hydroxyurea usage rate recently reported for the pediatric sickle cell program of Northern Virginia, analysis of data from 2011 to 2021 revealed no statistical difference in hydroxyurea usage rate between Medicaid and non-Medicaid, African American and African, or age less than 13 and age greater than or equal to 13 years cohorts, demonstrating that hydroxyurea can be successfully implemented across demographic groups.

31789782	Reversible Cerebral Vasoconstriction Syndrome and Sickle Cell Disease: A Case Report.	Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS), is rare in the pediatric population and is characterized by severe headaches and other neurologic symptoms. We present a case of RCVS occurring concomitantly with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome in an 8-year-old African American child with sickle cell disease (HbSS). Imaging studies including computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and cerebral angiography of the brain showed acute hemorrhagic stroke and a beaded appearance of peripheral cerebral vessels. In this report, we focus on the typical features of RCVS and discuss the underlying risk factors that may increase the risk in patients with HbSS disease.

37905989	Preferences for potential benefits and risks for gene therapy in the treatment of sickle cell disease.	Objective is to quantify benefit-risk tradeoffs pertaining to potential gene therapies among adults and parents/caregivers of children with sickle-cell disease (SCD). A discrete-choice experiment (DCE) survey was developed in which respondents selected their preferred treatment alternatives in a series of experimentally-controlled pairs of hypothetical gene therapies and a "no gene therapy" option. Gene therapy alternatives were defined based on the chance of eliminating SCD symptoms, expected increases in life expectancy they could offer, treatment-related risk of death and potential increases in lifetime cancer risk. Respondents made selections based on their current disease severity and in the context of expectations of worsened disease. Three clinical sites and one patient organization recruited 174 adult patients and 109 parents of children with SCD to complete the survey. Adult and parent respondents were generally willing to choose gene therapies, but the adults required higher expected levels of efficacy (i.e., higher chance of eliminating symptoms) than parents to choose gene therapies that conferred mortality risks of 10% or more. When adults and parents of children with less severe symptoms were asked to consider scenarios of higher levels of disease severity, the risk tolerance increased, and the lowest acceptable level of efficacy for gene therapies with mortality risks dropped by more than 50%. Baseline SCD symptoms are a major driver of gene therapy acceptability. Adults and parents of patients with milder symptoms may prefer other treatment options; however, an expectation of symptoms deterioration triggers strong reassessment of the acceptable benefit-risk balance of this novel technology.
34003573	Decision making for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in pediatric, adolescent, and young adult patients with a hemoglobinopathy-Shared or not?	BACKGROUND: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) offers an established curative option for sickle cell disease (SCD) and thalassemia patients but is associated with significant risks. Decision making is a complex process and shared decision making (SDM) could be a fitting approach in case of such preference-sensitive decisions. This study investigated what level of SDM is used in conversations with hemoglobinopathy patients and/or their caregivers considering HSCT as a curative treatment option. METHODS: Longitudinal, descriptive study using the Observing-Patient-Involvement-in-Decision-Making scale (OPTION5 ) scale to determine the level of SDM in conversations with 26 hemoglobinopathy patients and/or their caregivers. RESULTS: The total mean OPTION5 score was 43%, which is a moderate SDM approach. There was no difference between conversations with thalassemia patients and SCD patients. Conversations needing an interpreter scored worse than nontranslated conversations. The best scoring OPTION5 item was item 3: "informing about the various treatment options" (mean score 2.3 on scale 0-4). For OPTION5 item 4: "eliciting patients' preferences" a more skilled effort was measured for SCD patients compared to thalassemia patients. CONCLUSIONS: The mean OPTION5 score of "moderate" was achieved mainly by giving information on available options, which is primarily a one-way communication. The SDM process can be improved by actively inviting patients to deliberate about options and including their elicited preferences in decision making.
34628053	Editing outside the body: Ex vivo gene-modification for beta-hemoglobinopathy cellular therapy.	Genome editing produces genetic modifications in somatic cells, offering novel curative possibilities for sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia. These opportunities leverage clinical knowledge of hematopoietic stem cell transplant and gene transfer. Advantages to this mode of ex vivo therapy include locus-specific alteration of patient hematopoietic stem cell genomes, lack of allogeneic immune response, and avoidance of insertional mutagenesis. Despite exciting progress, many aspects of this approach remain to be optimized for ideal clinical implementation, including the efficiency and specificity of gene modification, delivery to hematopoietic stem cells, and robust and nontoxic engraftment of gene-modified cells. This review highlights genome editing as compared to other genetic therapies, the differences between editing strategies, and the clinical prospects and challenges of implementing genome editing as a novel treatment. As the world's most common monogenic disorders, the beta-hemoglobinopathies are at the forefront of bringing genome editing to the clinic and hold promise for molecular medicine to address human disease at its root.
37803115	New Insights into Clinical Management for Sickle Cell Disease: Uncovering the Significant Pathways Affected by the Involvement of Sickle Cell Disease.	One of the severe monogenic conditions with the highest prevalence in the globe is sickle cell disease. Although the significance of chronic anemia, hemolysis, and vasculopathy has been established, hemoglobin polymerization, which results in erythrocyte stiffness and Vaso-occlusion, is important to the pathophysiology of this disease. Clinical management is elementary, and there is scant reliable data for many treatments. The onset of cerebrovascular illness and cognitive impairment are two of the major issues associated with sickle cell disease in children, and it is only now that researchers are beginning to understand how blood transfusions and hydroxycarbamide can prevent these complications. When Vaso occlusion and inflammation occur repeatedly, the majority of organs are gradually damaged, including the brain, kidneys, lungs, bones, and cardiovascular system. This damage worsens with age. In our study, we focused on the specific pathways which are affected by the involvement of effected genes. Firstly, we retrieved the gene datasets from the publically available data source website DisGNET. Using literature-based genes, we identified 290 highly regulated genes that are directly associated with sickle cell disease. We subsequently performed a gene expression analysis and extracted a gene set using GEO2R analysis, which was then used to prune 290 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). After pruning we got 60 highly expressed genes. After identification of DEGs, we used these genes for pathway analysis. For the pathway analysis, we used Reactome software and we found that these DEGs are directly associated with 7 different pathways, which are alpha beta signaling pathways, 15 antiviral mechanism, Oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) antiviral response, interleukin 1 signaling pathways, interleukin 4 and 13, interleukin 10 signaling pathway, and aspirin ADME pathway. After pathway analysis, we can exactly relate how sickle cell disease alters the gene expression and how these genes affect the different pathways. Additionally, we performed gene ontology of 60 genes and identified the gene biological process, cellular component, and molecular functions as we mentioned in our results. With the help of our study data, there is a chance for pre-identification of sickle cell disease person. Our gene result was used as a biomarker of sickle cell disease. In this paper, our result is the primary approach for sickle cell disease; with the help of this paper any researcher can get their primary data and use that for further research.
36877640	Interventions for improving adherence to iron chelation therapy in people with sickle cell disease or thalassaemia.	BACKGROUND: Regularly transfused people with sickle cell disease (SCD) and people with thalassaemia are at risk of iron overload. Iron overload can lead to iron toxicity in vulnerable organs such as the heart, liver and endocrine glands, which can be prevented and treated with iron-chelating agents. The intensive demands and uncomfortable side effects of therapy can have a negative impact on daily activities and wellbeing, which may affect adherence. OBJECTIVES: To identify and assess the effectiveness of different types of interventions (psychological and psychosocial, educational, medication interventions, or multi-component interventions) and interventions specific to different age groups, to improve adherence to iron chelation therapy compared to another listed intervention, or standard care in people with SCD or thalassaemia. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL (Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ProQuest Dissertations & Global Theses, Web of Science & Social Sciences Conference Proceedings Indexes and ongoing trial databases (13 December 2021). We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register (1 August 2022). SELECTION CRITERIA: For trials comparing medications or medication changes, only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were eligible for inclusion. For studies including psychological and psychosocial interventions, educational interventions, or multi-component interventions, non-randomised studies of interventions (NRSIs), controlled before-after studies, and interrupted time series studies with adherence as a primary outcome were also eligible for inclusion. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: For this update, two authors independently assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias, and extracted data. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. MAIN RESULTS: We included 19 RCTs and one NRSI published between 1997 and 2021. One trial assessed medication management, one assessed an education intervention (NRSI) and 18 RCTs were of medication interventions. Medications assessed were subcutaneous deferoxamine, and two oral chelating agents, deferiprone and deferasirox. We rated the certainty of evidence as very low to low across all outcomes identified in this review. Four trials measured quality of life (QoL) with validated instruments, but provided no analysable data and reported no difference in QoL. We identified nine comparisons of interest. 1. Deferiprone versus deferoxamine We are uncertain whether or not deferiprone affects adherence to iron chelation therapy (four RCTs, unpooled, very low-certainty evidence), all-cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 1.21; 3 RCTs, 376 participants; very low-certainty evidence), or serious adverse events (SAEs) (RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.83 to 2.46; 1 RCT, 228 participants; very low-certainty evidence).  Adherence was reported as "good", "high" or "excellent" by all seven trials, though the data could not be analysed formally: adherence ranged from 69% to 95% (deferiprone, mean 86.6%), and 71% to 93% (deferoxamine, mean 78.8%), based on five trials (474 participants) only. 2. Deferasirox versus deferoxamine We are uncertain whether or not deferasirox affects adherence to iron chelation therapy (three RCTs, unpooled, very low-certainty evidence), although medication adherence was high in all trials. We are uncertain whether or not there is any difference between the drug therapies in serious adverse events (SAEs) (SCD or thalassaemia) or all-cause mortality (thalassaemia). 3. Deferiprone versus deferasirox We are uncertain if there is a difference between oral deferiprone and deferasirox based on a single trial in children (average age 9 to 10 years) with any hereditary haemoglobinopathy in adherence, SAEs and all-cause mortality. 4. Deferasirox film-coated tablet (FCT) versus deferasirox dispersible tablet (DT) One RCT compared deferasirox in different tablet forms. There may be a preference for FCTs, shown through a trend for greater adherence (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.22; 1 RCT, 88 participants), although medication adherence was high in both groups (FCT 92.9%; DT 85.3%). We are uncertain if there is a benefit in chelation-related AEs with FCTs. We are uncertain if there is a difference in the incidence of SAEs, all-cause mortality or sustained adherence. 5. Deferiprone and deferoxamine combined versus deferiprone alone We are uncertain if there is a difference in adherence, though reporting was usually narrative as triallists report it was "excellent" in both groups (three RCTs, unpooled). We are uncertain if there is a difference in the incidence of SAEs and all-cause mortality.  6. Deferiprone and deferoxamine combined versus deferoxamine alone We are uncertain if there is a difference in adherence (four RCTs), SAEs (none reported in the trial period) and all-cause mortality (no deaths reported in the trial period). There was high adherence in all trials. 7. Deferiprone and deferoxamine combined versus deferiprone and deferasirox combined There may be a difference in favour of deferiprone and deferasirox (combined) in rates of adherence (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.99) (one RCT), although it was high (> 80%) in both groups. We are uncertain if there is a difference in SAEs, and no deaths were reported in the trial, so we cannot draw conclusions based on these data (one RCT). 8. Medication management versus standard care We are uncertain if there is a difference in QoL (one RCT), and we could not assess adherence due to a lack of reporting in the control group. 9. Education versus standard care One quasi-experimental (NRSI) study could not be analysed due to the severe baseline confounding. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The medication comparisons included in this review had higher than average adherence rates not accounted for by differences in medication administration or side effects, though often follow-up was not good (high dropout over longer trials), with adherence based on a per protocol analysis. Participants may have been selected based on higher adherence to trial medications at baseline. Also, within the clinical trial context, there is increased attention and involvement of clinicians, thus high adherence rates may be an artefact of trial participation. Real-world, pragmatic trials in community and clinic settings are needed that examine both confirmed or unconfirmed adherence strategies that may increase adherence to iron chelation therapy. Due to lack of evidence this review cannot comment on intervention strategies for different age groups.
33757549	Hydroxyurea and blood transfusion therapy for Sickle cell disease in South Asia: inconsistent treatment of a neglected disease.	BACKGROUND: Hydroxyurea and blood transfusion therapies remain the main therapeutic strategies for Sickle cell disease. Preliminary data suggest substantial variation and inconsistencies in practice of these two therapeutic modalities in South Asia. In this systematic review we searched Medline, Cochrane library and Scopus for articles on usage of hydroxyurea and blood transfusion therapies for sickle cell disease in South Asia published in English between October 2005 and October 2020. RESULTS: We selected 41 papers: 33 from India, 3 from Sri Lanka, 2 each from Pakistan and Bangladesh and one from Nepal. Only 14 prospective trials focused on hydroxyurea therapy from which majority (n = 10; 71.4%) adopted fixed low dose (10 mg/kg/day) regimen. With hydroxyurea therapy, 12 and 9 studies reported significant reductions in vaso-occlusive crises and transfusion requirement respectively. Severe anaemia (haemoglobin level < 6-7 g/dl) was the commonest indicator (n = 8) for transfusion therapy followed by vaso-occlusive crisis. CONCLUSIONS: Published data on the hydroxyurea and transfusion therapies in South Asia are limited and heterogeneous. A clear gap of knowledge exists about the nature of the sickle cell disease in the Indian subcontinent particularly from countries outside India necessitating further evidence-based assessments and interventions.
34564050	Global geographic differences in healthcare utilization for sickle cell disease pain crises in the CASiRe cohort.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is characterized by frequent, unpredictable pain episodes and other vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs) leading to significant healthcare utilization. VOC frequency is often an endpoint in clinical trials investigating novel therapies for this devastating disease. PROCEDURE: The Consortium for the Advancement of Sickle Cell Research (CASiRe) is an international collaboration investigating clinical severity in SCD using a validated questionnaire and medical chart review standardized across four countries (United States, United Kingdom, Italy and Ghana). RESULTS: This study, focused on pain crisis incidence and healthcare utilization, included 868 patients, equally represented according to age and gender. HgbSS was the most common genotype. Patients from Ghana used the Emergency Room/Day Hospital for pain more frequently (annualized mean 2.01) than patients from other regions (annualized mean 1.56 U.S.; 1.09 U.K.; 0.02 Italy), while U.K. patients were hospitalized for pain more often (annualized mean: U.K. 2.98) than patients in other regions (annualized mean 1.98 U.S.; 1.18 Ghana; Italy 0.54). Italy's hospitalization rate for pain (annualized mean: 0.57) was nearly 20 times greater than its emergency room/day hospital only visits for pain (annualized mean: 0.03). When categorized by genotype and age, similar results were seen. CONCLUSIONS: Geographic differences in pain crisis frequency and healthcare utilization may correlate with variable organization of healthcare systems among countries and should be considered regarding trial design, endpoints, and analysis of results when investigating novel agents for clinical benefit.
31782875	Early viral reactivation despite excellent immune reconstitution following haploidentical Bone marrow transplant with post-transplant cytoxan for sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Haploidentical bone marrow transplant (haplo-BMT) offers near universal donor availability as a curative modality for individuals with severe sickle cell disease (SCD). However, the required intense immunodepletion is associated with increased infectious complications. A paucity of data exists on immune reconstitution following haplo-BMT for SCD. METHODS: A multi-institution learning collaborative was developed in the context of a phase II clinical trial of a non-myeloablative, related haplo-BMT with post-transplant cyclophosphamide for SCD. We report results from a cohort of 23 patients for whom immune reconstitution data up to one year were available. RESULTS: Median age was 14.8 years. Out of 23, 18 participants received pre-conditioning with azathioprine, hydroxyurea, and hypertransfusions. 70% (16/23) of participants had multiple indications for haplo-BMT. We observed excellent immune reconstitution of CD4, CD8, CD19, and CD56 cellular subsets by 6 months post transplant. Engraftment rate and event-free survival in this cohort were 100% and 96%, respectively. 70% (16/23) of patients had at least one viral reactivation or infection, including CMV 35% (8/23), HHV-6 22% (5/23), and polyoma virus 17% (4/23), with no cases of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease. CONCLUSION: Further prospective studies are needed to better characterize immune reconstitution and the immunologic basis for increased viral reactivation following haplo-BMT with post-transplant cyclophosphamide for SCD.
32072613	The association of psychiatric comorbidities with emergency visits and hospitalisations in adult sickle-cell patients: a cohort study.	
31681984	Malaria chemoprophylaxis in sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Malaria is the most common precipitating cause of crises in sickle cell disease in malaria-endemic countries. Health professionals often recommend life-long malaria chemoprophylaxis for people with sickle cell disease living in these areas. It is therefore important we have good evidence of benefit. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of routine malaria chemoprophylaxis in people with sickle cell disease. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register (January 2006), Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Specialized Register (July 2006), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2006, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2006), EMBASE (1974 to January 2006), LILACS (1982 to January 2006), and reference lists. We also contacted organizations and pharmaceutical companies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing chemoprophylaxis with any antimalarial drug given for a minimum of three months compared with a placebo or no intervention. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently applied the inclusion criteria, assessed the risk of bias in the trials, and extracted data. Dichotomous data were analysed using risk ratios (RR) and presented with 95% confidence intervals (CI). MAIN RESULTS: Two trials with a total of 223 children with homozygous sickle cell disease met the inclusion criteria. A randomized controlled trial in Nigeria compared two different antimalarial drugs with a placebo, and reported that chemoprophylaxis reduced sickle cell crises (RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.83; 97 children), hospital admissions (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.63; 97 participants), and blood transfusions (RR 0.16, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.56; 97 participants). A quasi-randomized controlled trial of 126 children in Uganda compared an antimalarial drug plus antibiotics with no antimalarial plus placebo. Chemoprophylaxis reduced the number of episodes of malaria and dactylitis, and increased mean haemoglobin values in this trial. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: It is beneficial to give routine malaria chemoprophylaxis in sickle cell disease in areas where malaria is endemic. 4 November 2019 Update pending New contributors needed The CIDG Editors are looking for contributors to update and maintain this Cochrane Review.

32470105	Use of nonopioid agents for inpatient pain management of sickle cell disease.	
32789826	Patient-controlled analgesia and morphine consumption in sickle cell anemia painful crises: A new protocol.	OBJECTIVES: The sudden and rapidly increasing severity of pain in sickle cell anemia painful crises frequently requires the use of strong opioids. Patients require continuous administrations of various doses (increased/decreased) within the following hours. This study aims to retrospectively evaluate the effects of a structured protocol based on standardized Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) patient demand count on morphine consumption in painful crises. METHODS: A total of 177 painful crises of 93 patients who were administered morphine using the PCA method according to appropriate analgesia protocol between 2004-2018 were evaluated in this study. The demographic data, hemoglobin chromatography and genotypes, painful episode follow-up time, VAS scores before and after treatment, and daily morphine consumption of the patients were recorded. Morphine consumption during the crisis according to age groups and sex were compared. RESULTS: Of the patients, 57% were homozygous hemoglobin type SS (HbSS). Mean morphine consumption with PCA method was 56.9+-35.4 mg (min-max: 10-232 mg) and mean follow-up time was 3.4+-2.1 days (min.-max.: 1-11). VAS scores were significantly lower after treatment (6.8+-2.3 pre-treatment; 0.8+-0.6 post-treatment) (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, our study is the first structured protocol based on VAS and PCA demand data. We believe lower morphine dosage using PCA protocol according to the rapidly changing pain levels of the patients will provide effective analgesia. Prospective studies with fewer limitations will more effectively demonstrate the effectiveness of this protocol.
32439490	Characterization of circulating and cultured Tfh-like cells in sickle cell disease in relation to red blood cell alloimmunization status.	BACKGROUND: People living with sickle cell disease (SCD) are prone to red blood cell (RBC) alloimmunization. We hypothesized that subjects with alloantibodies (responders) would have differences in circulating T-follicular helper (Tfh)-like cells compared to subjects without alloantibodies (non-responders). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were collected from 28 subjects, including those with SCD and controls. Circulating CD4 T-cell subsets were first evaluated at baseline. CD4 T-cell subsets were also evaluated after naive CD4 T-cells were differentiated into Tfh-like cells following in vitro culture with CD3/CD28 beads, IL-7, IL-12, and Activin A. Transfusion and alloantibody histories were extracted from the electronic medical record. RESULTS: Non-responders had a lower percentage of CD45RA negative Tmemory cells than responders or controls (p<0.05). Notably, there were no differences in circulating Tfh-like cells between any group. However, naive CD4 T-cells from subjects with SCD were more likely to express CXCR5 after in vitro culture than cells from controls. After culture, CXCR5 expressing cells from responders were more likely to express PD1 and ICOS (16.43 %, sd. 20.23) compared to non-responders (3.69 %, s.d. 3.09) or controls (2.78 %, s.d. 2.04). DISCUSSION: The tendency for naive CD4 T-cells from responders to differentiate into Tfh-like cells after in vitro culture may suggest these cells are prepared to assist B-cells with antibody production regardless of antigen specificity. Further studies are needed, but it is possible that these results may explain why some responders form RBC alloantibodies with multiple specificities, in addition to RBC autoantibodies and HLA alloantibodies.
32716555	Blood transfusion for preventing primary and secondary stroke in people with sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease is one of the commonest severe monogenic disorders in the world, due to the inheritance of two abnormal haemoglobin (beta globin) genes. Sickle cell disease can cause severe pain, significant end-organ damage, pulmonary complications, and premature death. Stroke affects around 10% of children with sickle cell anaemia (HbSS). Chronic blood transfusions may reduce the risk of vaso-occlusion and stroke by diluting the proportion of sickled cells in the circulation. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2002, and last updated in 2017. OBJECTIVES: To assess risks and benefits of chronic blood transfusion regimens in people with sickle cell disease for primary and secondary stroke prevention (excluding silent cerebral infarcts). SEARCH METHODS: We searched for relevant trials in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the Transfusion Evidence Library (from 1980), and ongoing trial databases; all searches current to 8 October 2019. We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 19 September 2019. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials comparing red blood cell transfusions as prophylaxis for stroke in people with sickle cell disease to alternative or standard treatment. There were no restrictions by outcomes examined, language or publication status. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility and the risk of bias and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: We included five trials (660 participants) published between 1998 and 2016. Four of these trials were terminated early. The vast majority of participants had the haemoglobin (Hb)SS form of sickle cell disease. Three trials compared regular red cell transfusions to standard care in primary prevention of stroke: two in children with no previous long-term transfusions; and one in children and adolescents on long-term transfusion. Two trials compared the drug hydroxyurea (hydroxycarbamide) and phlebotomy to long-term transfusions and iron chelation therapy: one in primary prevention (children); and one in secondary prevention (children and adolescents). The quality of the evidence was very low to moderate across different outcomes according to GRADE methodology. This was due to the trials being at a high risk of bias due to lack of blinding, indirectness and imprecise outcome estimates. Red cell transfusions versus standard care Children with no previous long-term transfusions Long-term transfusions probably reduce the incidence of clinical stroke in children with a higher risk of stroke (abnormal transcranial doppler velocities or previous history of silent cerebral infarct), risk ratio 0.12 (95% confidence interval 0.03 to 0.49) (two trials, 326 participants), moderate quality evidence. Long-term transfusions may: reduce the incidence of other sickle cell disease-related complications (acute chest syndrome, risk ratio 0.24 (95% confidence interval 0.12 to 0.48)) (two trials, 326 participants); increase quality of life (difference estimate -0.54, 95% confidence interval -0.92 to -0.17) (one trial, 166 participants); but make little or no difference to IQ scores (least square mean: 1.7, standard error 95% confidence interval -1.1 to 4.4) (one trial, 166 participants), low quality evidence. We are very uncertain whether long-term transfusions: reduce the risk of transient ischaemic attacks, Peto odds ratio 0.13 (95% confidence interval 0.01 to 2.11) (two trials, 323 participants); have any effect on all-cause mortality, no deaths reported (two trials, 326 participants); or increase the risk of alloimmunisation, risk ratio 3.16 (95% confidence interval 0.18 to 57.17) (one trial, 121 participants), very low quality evidence. Children and adolescents with previous long-term transfusions (one trial, 79 participants) We are very uncertain whether continuing long-term transfusions reduces the incidence of: stroke, risk ratio 0.22 (95% confidence interval 0.01 to 4.35); or all-cause mortality, Peto odds ratio 8.00 (95% confidence interval 0.16 to 404.12), very low quality evidence. Several review outcomes were only reported in one trial arm (sickle cell disease-related complications, alloimmunisation, transient ischaemic attacks). The trial did not report neurological impairment, or quality of life. Hydroxyurea and phlebotomy versus red cell transfusions and chelation Neither trial reported on neurological impairment, alloimmunisation, or quality of life. Primary prevention, children (one trial, 121 participants) Switching to hydroxyurea and phlebotomy may have little or no effect on liver iron concentrations, mean difference -1.80 mg Fe/g dry-weight liver (95% confidence interval -5.16 to 1.56), low quality evidence. We are very uncertain whether switching to hydroxyurea and phlebotomy has any effect on: risk of stroke (no strokes); all-cause mortality (no deaths); transient ischaemic attacks, risk ratio 1.02 (95% confidence interval 0.21 to 4.84); or other sickle cell disease-related complications (acute chest syndrome, risk ratio 2.03 (95% confidence interval 0.39 to 10.69)), very low quality evidence. Secondary prevention, children and adolescents (one trial, 133 participants) Switching to hydroxyurea and phlebotomy may: increase the risk of sickle cell disease-related serious adverse events, risk ratio 3.10 (95% confidence interval 1.42 to 6.75); but have little or no effect on median liver iron concentrations (hydroxyurea, 17.3 mg Fe/g dry-weight liver (interquartile range 10.0 to 30.6)); transfusion 17.3 mg Fe/g dry-weight liver (interquartile range 8.8 to 30.7), low quality evidence. We are very uncertain whether switching to hydroxyurea and phlebotomy: increases the risk of stroke, risk ratio 14.78 (95% confidence interval 0.86 to 253.66); or has any effect on all-cause mortality, Peto odds ratio 0.98 (95% confidence interval 0.06 to 15.92); or transient ischaemic attacks, risk ratio 0.66 (95% confidence interval 0.25 to 1.74), very low quality evidence. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence for managing adults, or children who do not have HbSS sickle cell disease. In children who are at higher risk of stroke and have not had previous long-term transfusions, there is moderate quality evidence that long-term red cell transfusions reduce the risk of stroke, and low quality evidence they also reduce the risk of other sickle cell disease-related complications. In primary and secondary prevention of stroke there is low quality evidence that switching to hydroxyurea with phlebotomy has little or no effect on the liver iron concentration. In secondary prevention of stroke there is low-quality evidence that switching to hydroxyurea with phlebotomy increases the risk of sickle cell disease-related events. All other evidence in this review is of very low quality.

36726036	Massage therapy for children, adolescents, and young adults: Clinical delivery and effectiveness in hematology and oncology.	BACKGROUND: Children, adolescents, and young adults with hematologic and/or oncologic conditions experience multiple, significant symptoms (e.g., pain, stress, and anxiety), which may be addressed by nonpharmacologic approaches such as massage therapy (MT). The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical delivery of MT provided by a certified pediatric massage therapist and assess effectiveness in two patient groups: those with sickle cell disease (SCD) or hematologic and/or oncologic conditions excluding SCD (HemOnc). METHODS: Investigators conducted a retrospective review of MT sessions provided to patients 0-39 years with hematologic and/or oncologic conditions at a large pediatric academic medical center. RESULTS: Between October 2019 and December 2021, 3015 MT sessions were provided to 243 patients (171 HemOnc; 72 SCD) and documented in the electronic health record. Patients (mean age: 12.21 +- 7.19 years) were generally White (49.4%) or Black/African American (43.2%), non-Hispanic (94.2%), and 52.3% female. Patients in the SCD group (vs. patients in the HemOnc group) reported significantly higher (p < .05) pretreatment pain (6.95 vs. 4.46), stress (6.47 vs. 4.58), and anxiety (6.67 vs. 4.59). All patients reported clinically and statistically significant (p < .001) mean reductions in pain (-2.25 +- 1.87), stress (-2.50 +- 1.73), and anxiety (-2.52 +- 1.69), with patients in the HemOnc group reporting greater mean pain change (-2.54 vs. -1.87) than patients in the SCD group. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the clinical effectiveness of MT for addressing acute pain, stress, and anxiety among youth with hematologic and/or oncologic conditions. Future research is needed to identify optimal MT utilization.
38613166	Good engraftment after reduced intensity targeted busulfan-based conditioning and matched related donor hematopoietic cell transplantation in hemoglobinopathies.	BACKGROUND: Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is an established curative therapy for transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT) and sickle cell disease (SCD). The latest American Society of Hematology guidelines recommend myeloablative preparative regimen in patients under 18 years of age. PROCEDURE: The objective was to demonstrate safety and efficacy of a reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen including high-dose fludarabine, anti-thymocyte globulin, and targeted busulfan as a single alkylator to sub-myeloablative exposures. RESULTS: Between 2012 and 2021, 11 patients with SCD and five patients with TDT and matched related donor (MRD) HCT were included. The median age at transplantation was 8.3 years (range: 3.7-18.8 years). The median administered busulfan AUC was 67.4 mg/Lxh (range: 60.7-80 mg/Lxh). Overall survival was 93.8% and event-free survival 87.5% with one engrafted SCD patient with pre-existing moyamoya disease succumbing after drainage of a subdural hematoma. One SCD patient developed a secondary graft failure and was treated with a second HCT. Myeloid chimerism was full in all other patients with a median follow-up time of 4.1 years (range: 2.0-11.1 years), whereas T-cell donor chimerism was frequently mixed. CONCLUSION: This RIC conditioning followed by MRD HCT is sufficiently myeloablative to cure pediatric patients with hemoglobinopathies without the need for additional total body irradiation or thiotepa.
34122418	Answered and Unanswered Questions in Early-Stage Viral Vector Transduction Biology and Innate Primary Cell Toxicity for Ex-Vivo Gene Editing.	Adeno-associated virus is a highly efficient DNA delivery vehicle for genome editing strategies that employ CRISPR/Cas9 and a DNA donor for homology-directed repair. Many groups have used this strategy in development of therapies for blood and immune disorders such as sickle-cell anemia and severe-combined immunodeficiency. However, recent events have called into question the immunogenicity of AAV as a gene therapy vector and the safety profile dictated by the immune response to this vector. The target cells dictating this response and the molecular mechanisms dictating cellular response to AAV are poorly understood. Here, we will investigate the current known AAV capsid and genome interactions with cellular proteins during early stage vector transduction and how these interactions may influence innate cellular responses. We will discuss the current understanding of innate immune activation and DNA damage response to AAV, and the limitations of what is currently known. In particular, we will focus on pathway differences in cell line verses primary cells, with a focus on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in the context of ex-vivo gene editing, and what we can learn from HSPC infection by other parvoviruses. Finally, we will discuss how innate immune and DNA damage response pathway activation in these highly sensitive stem cell populations may impact long-term engraftment and clinical outcomes as these gene-editing strategies move towards the clinic, with the aim to propose pathways relevant for improved hematopoietic stem cell survival and long-term engraftment after AAV-mediated genome editing.
33221401	A Rare Complication of Sickle Cell Anemia.	
34224433	The different facets of sickle cell disease-related pulmonary hypertension.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Sickle cell disease (SCD), one of the most common genetic diseases in the world, is characterized by repeated episodes of hemolysis and vaso-occlusion. Hemolytic anemia is a risk factor for the development of pulmonary hypertension, and currently SCD-related pulmonary hypertension is classified as World Health Organization group 5 pulmonary hypertension. Patients with SCD-related pulmonary hypertension have unique hemodynamics, multiple comorbidities, and distinct phenotypes that may contribute to the development of pulmonary hypertension. RECENT FINDINGS: SCD-related pulmonary hypertension is defined as a mean pulmonary artery pressure >20 mmHg, a pulmonary artery occlusion pressure <=15 mmHg and relatively low pulmonary vascular resistance (>2 Wood units) rather than the traditional definition of >=3 Wood units, an important distinction due to a baseline high-cardiac output state in the setting of chronic anemia and low vascular resistance. Diastolic dysfunction is frequently identified in this patient population and right heart catheterization is essential to determine if combined pre- and postcapillary pulmonary hypertension is present. Thromboembolism is common among patients with SCD, and screening for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension is essential. Data regarding advanced therapies are limited. Primary treatment options include targeting correction of their primary hemoglobinopathy as well as aggressive management of underlying comorbid conditions. SUMMARY: SCD-related pulmonary hypertension is common among patients with SCD and is associated with increased mortality. A high index of suspicion is warranted during evaluation to identify all potential factors that may be contributing to disease.
36617736	Assessing barriers and facilitators to transition in sickle cell disease care prior to implementation of a formalized program.	Over 95% of children with sickle cell disease (SCD) survive into adulthood in the United States. However, early mortality remains a problem, especially in persons between the ages of 18 and 35. One possible explanation for the increased mortality rate in young adults is difficulties in engaging in care during the transition from a heavily contiguous pediatric healthcare model to a more self-reliant adult healthcare model. The goal of this study was to identify potential facilitators and barriers to a successful transfer in care from the pediatric to adult SCD program before the formation of a formal transition program. This is a retrospective cohort study of transition outcomes for 472 individuals with SCD (all genotypes) treated at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) sickle cell clinic (aged 18-24). The primary outcome was whether the patient continued care in (any) adult SCD program (defined as being seen at least once in an adult hematology/SCD clinic). One hundred eighty-eight (45%) transition age patients successfully transferred to adult care. Facilitators to successful transfer in care included being treated at the same hospital for both pediatric and adult programs, having the genotype HbSS, and/or receiving an SCD-modifying therapy at the time of transition (hydroxyurea and/or red cell transfusion therapy). Of primary interest, many of the patients who failed to transition to an adult clinic were lost to follow-up prior to 15 years of age. Importantly, these patients who had previously been labeled as "transition failures," were lost to follow-up long before the transition age. Early engagement is needed for this population.
31917797	A study to better understand under-utilization of laboratory tests for antenatal care in Senegal.	OBJECTIVE: To better understand factors contributing to underutilization of laboratory services for health care delivery in sub-Saharan Africa, we conducted a study in Senegalese Antenatal Care clinics (ANC) and laboratories to determine the extent of underutilization, contributing factors, and bottlenecks in the cascade of care from first ANC visit, test uptake, to availability of test results and appropriate clinical management. METHODS: At 16 health facilities, pregnant women attending for their first ANC visit were consecutively recruited and information was prospectively collected on the request, execution, results and clinical management of seven nationally recommended laboratory screening tests for normal pregnancy: hemoglobin concentration (Hb), syphilis serology, HIV serology, determination of proteinuria (PU), determination of blood group and Rhesus factor, Emmel test to detect sickle cell disease, and glycaemia. Health facility staff were interviewed on human resource capacity, management of the ANC and the laboratory, and availability and use of guidelines. RESULTS: Of 1246 ANC attendants, 400 (32%) had complete results. Completeness varied between facilities from 0-99%. In multilevel logistic regression analysis of women nested in facilities, complete uptake was lower if women started ANC later in pregnancy; very low in rural ANC attendants who ever delivered compared to urban primigravidae (OR 0.064; 95%CI 0.00-0.52); and higher if the facility routinely recommended all seven tests. In the cascade from test request to clinical management, the most frequent bottleneck was non-execution of requested tests, while unavailability of results for executed test was uncommon (<2%). Overall, of 525 abnormal test results 97(18%) had a record of adequate clinical management. CONCLUSION: Our study illustrates challenges to test uptake even when laboratory testing capacity is in place, with large differences between facilities, and underscores the importance of management, policy, and the importance of considering local context in order to improve service delivery to expectant mothers.
34965539	Clinical Pathway for Vaso-Occlusive Pain Reduces Hospital Admissions.	BACKGROUND: Vaso-occlusive pain leads to high acute care utilization among patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Data suggest that clinical pathways (CPWs) reduce variation in the management of vaso-occlusive pain and improve clinical outcomes. METHODS: We implemented and evaluated a CPW for vaso-occlusive pain at our institution using a before and after study design. The primary objective was to decrease acute care utilization among patients with SCD, which was assessed by the primary outcome measures of hospital length of stay (LOS), 30-day readmission rate, and total hospitalizations annually per patient. Secondary outcome measures were packed red blood cell transfusions, and acute chest syndrome incidence. Patient-controlled analgesia use and promethazine use were assessed to estimate CPW use. RESULTS: Three hundred fourty-four admissions in 112 patients were analyzed, of which 193 admissions occurred pre-CPW and 151 admissions occurred post-CPW implementation. Post-CPW implementation, we observed a significant decrease in hospital admissions annually per patient, an increase in patient-controlled analgesia use, and a decrease in intravenous promethazine use. We observed trends toward decreased 30-day readmission rate and increased acute chest syndrome incidence, which were not statistically significant. No effect was found on hospital LOS. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical pathway implementation at our institution reduced variation in management and decreased hospital admissions for vaso-occlusive pain.
37919142	Haematopoietic stem cell health in sickle cell disease and its implications for stem cell therapies and secondary haematological disorders.	Gene modification of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is a potentially curative approach to sickle cell disease (SCD) and offers hope for patients who are not eligible for allogeneic HSC transplantation. Current approaches require in vitro manipulation of healthy autologous HSC prior to their transplantation. However, the health and integrity of HSCs may be compromised by a variety of disease processes in SCD, and challenges have emerged in the clinical trials of gene therapy. There is also concern about increased susceptibility to haematological malignancies during long-term follow up of patients, and this raises questions about genomic stability in the stem cell compartment. In this review, we evaluate the evidence for HSC deficits in SCD and then discuss their potential causation. Finally, we suggest several questions which need to be addressed in order to progress with successful HSC manipulation for gene therapy in SCD.
34542932	Influenza vaccination rates and hospitalizations among Medicaid enrollees with and without sickle cell disease, 2009-2015.	BACKGROUND: Personswith sickle cell disease (SCD) face increased risks for pulmonary and infection-related complications. This study examines influenza vaccination coverage and estimates influenza-related morbidity among Medicaid enrollees with and without SCD. PROCEDURE: Influenza vaccination coverage and hospitalizations related to influenza and pneumonia/acute chest syndrome (ACS) during each influenza season from 2009-2010 to 2014-2015 were assessed among enrollees in the IBM MarketScan  Multi-State Medicaid Database. Enrollees with SCD were identified as enrollees with greater than or equal to three claims listing SCD within a 5-year period during 2003-2017. Vaccinations were identified in outpatient claims. Hospitalizations associated with influenza or pneumonia/ACS were identified using inpatient claims. This study includes a series of cross-sectional assessments by season. RESULTS: From 2009-2010 through 2014-2015 seasons, the SCD sample ranged from 5044 to 8651 enrollees; the non-SCD sample ranged from 1,841,756 to 3,796,337 enrollees. Influenza vaccination coverage was higher among enrollees with SCD compared with enrollees without SCD for all seasons (24.5%-33.6% and 18.2%-22.0%, respectively). Age-standardized rates of influenza-related hospitalizations were 20-42 times higher among SCD enrollees compared with non-SCD enrollees, and ACS/pneumonia hospitalizations were 18-29 times higher. Among enrollees with SCD, influenza-related hospitalization rates were highest among children aged 0-9 years. Among enrollees without SCD, influenza-related hospitalization rates were highest among adults aged 40-64 years. CONCLUSIONS: Although vaccine coverage was higher in persons with versus without SCD, efforts to increase influenza coverage further are warranted for this high-risk group, who experienced markedly higher rates of influenza and ACS/pneumonia hospitalizations during each season.
34090531	Genome-based therapeutic interventions for beta-type hemoglobinopathies.	For decades, various strategies have been proposed to solve the enigma of hemoglobinopathies, especially severe cases. However, most of them seem to be lagging in terms of effectiveness and safety. So far, the most prevalent and promising treatment options for patients with beta-types hemoglobinopathies, among others, predominantly include drug treatment and gene therapy. Despite the significant improvements of such interventions to the patient's quality of life, a variable response has been demonstrated among different groups of patients and populations. This is essentially due to the complexity of the disease and other genetic factors. In recent years, a more in-depth understanding of the molecular basis of the beta-type hemoglobinopathies has led to significant upgrades to the current technologies, as well as the addition of new ones attempting to elucidate these barriers. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to shed light on pharmacogenomics, gene addition, and genome editing technologies, and consequently, their potential use as direct and indirect genome-based interventions, in different strategies, referring to drug and gene therapy. Furthermore, all the latest progress, updates, and scientific achievements for patients with beta-type hemoglobinopathies will be described in detail.
38388223	The role of preoperative transfusion in sickle cell disease, a systematic review and meta-analysis.	This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to provide guidance on preoperative blood transfusion strategies for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). We included all randomized controlled and observational studies exploring the clinical outcomes of preoperative blood transfusion among patients with SCD compared to the conservative transfusion strategy until 14/09/2022. Sixteen studies involving 3486 participants were analysed. The findings revealed a significantly higher bleeding rate in patients who received preoperative transfusion than those who followed a conservative strategy (RR = 4.32, 95% CI 1.75-10.68, P = 0.002, I2 = 0%). However, the two strategies had no significant differences in other clinical outcomes, such as acute chest syndrome, painful crisis, fever, neurological complications, thrombosis, ICU admission, and mortality. It is important to note that all the included studies had a moderate risk of bias. Preoperative transfusion in SCD was associated with a higher bleeding risk but a similar risk in other outcomes compared to conservative strategies. Notably, the increased bleeding risk observed seldom had clinical significance. We recommend individualizing management strategies, considering the overall positive impact of transfusions in reducing complications. Further high-quality studies are needed to refine recommendations.

34285054	Safety of maximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing in individuals with sickle cell disease: a systematic review.	OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the safety of maximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) in individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD). Maximal CPET using gas exchange analysis is the gold standard for measuring cardiopulmonary fitness in the laboratory, yet its safety in the SCD population is unclear. DESIGN: Systematic review. DATA SOURCES: Systematic search of Medline (PubMed), EMBASE, Cochrane, ClinicalTrials.gov and professional society websites for all published studies and abstracts through December 2020. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: Two reviewers independently extracted data of interest from studies that assessed safety outcomes of maximal CPET in children and adults with SCD. A modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess for risk of bias in studies included. RESULTS: In total, 24 studies met inclusion/exclusion criteria. Adverse events were reported separately or as part of study results in 36 (3.8%) of 939 participants with SCD undergoing maximal CPET in studies included. Most adverse events were related to transient ischaemic changes on ECG monitoring or oxygen desaturation during testing, which did not result in arrhythmias or other complications. Only 4 (0.43%) of 939 participants experienced pain events due to maximal CPET. CONCLUSION: Maximal CPET appears to be a safe testing modality in children and adults with SCD and can be used to better understand the physiological basis of reduced exercise capacity and guide exercise prescription in this population. Some studies did not focus on reporting adverse events related to exercise testing or failed to mention safety monitoring, which contributed to risk of bias.
33794895	Improvement of SCD morbimortality in children: experience in a remote area of an African country.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a public health problem in the Democratic Republic of Congo. While reference sickle cell centers have been implemented in capital cities of African countries and have proven to be beneficial for SCD patients. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, they have never been set up in remote areas for families with low or very low sources of income. METHOD: A cohort of 143 children with SCD aged 10 years old (IQR (interquartile range): 6-15 years) (sex ratio male/female = 1.3) were clinically followed for 12 months without any specific intervention aside from the management of acute events, and then for 12 months with a monthly medical visit, biological follow-up, and chemoprophylaxis (folic acid/penicillin), adequate fluids and malaria prevention. RESULTS: The median age of patients at the diagnosis of SCD was 2 years (IQR: 1-5). The implementation of standardized and regular follow-ups in a new sickle cell reference center in a remote city showed an increase in the annual mean hemoglobin level from 50 to 70 g/L (p = 0.001), and a decrease in the lymphocyte count and spleen size (p < 0.001). A significant decrease (p < 0.001) in the average annual number of hospitalizations and episodes of vaso-occlusive crises, blood transfusions, infections, and acute chest syndromes were also observed. CONCLUSIONS: The creation of a sickle cell reference center and the regular follow-up of children with sickle cell disease are possible and applicable in the context of a remote city of an African country and represent simple and accessible measures that can reduce the morbimortality of children with sickle cell disease.
35635234	Accuracy of online medical information: the case of social media in sickle cell disease.	The medical needs of individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD) are complex. Patients with SCD experience complications such as recurrent pain episodes and increased hospitalizations. Over 70% of AYA and their parents seek medical information from the Internet; 83% inquire on sites that have interactive/social features, such as Facebook or Twitter, yet accuracy remains unclear. Our objective was to assess the accuracy of the SCD-information posted on social media. We hypothesized that most of the posted information is inaccurate. We coded one month of threads from two common SCD Facebook groups (Sickle Cell Warriors Unity and Sickle Cell Anemia) to identify the purpose of each post and the accuracy of medical information posted. Amongst both social media sites, there were 487 posts. Most of the posts were directed toward socializations (n = 311, 63.8%), while other posts mainly focused mainly on SCD and its management (n = 173, 35.5%). When looking at the medical posts, 44.9% were accurate, whereas 55.1% of the posts included inaccurate information. We found that less than half of the medical information posted on interactive social media is inaccurate. Our findings raise potentially serious implications for individuals with SCD and/or their caregivers who may rely on social media to gather more information about their or their child's disease. Our data highlight the importance of health care providers encouraging patients and parents to ask any questions they may have about SCD, given they may consult social media and Internet site that provide inaccurate information.
33515732	Transfusion and sickle cell anemia in Africa.	Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is the commonest life-threatening genetic disorder in tropical regions, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. It has been estimated that between 50-90% of SCA children will die in Africa before the age of 5, corresponding to a number of 150,000-300,000 annual SCA child deaths, which represents 5-10% of total child mortality. Transfusion support remains an essential component in the management of patients with SCA and has made a significant contribution to improving patient morbidity and mortality. In Africa where the majority of patients with SCA reside, many blood transfusion challenges remains, including shortage of blood supplies, risks related to infectious and immunologic potential side effects and limitation on the diagnosis and management of post-transfusion iron overload. The proportion of transfused SCA patients varies from different studies, between 30% and 90%. This variation can be related to environmental factors, disease genetic factors and other factors including the low availability of blood, difficulties in accessing to health care and inadequacies of the transfusion system. Because blood transfusion therapy is an integral component of the management of SCA, improved efforts and strategies to overcome these challenges and optimize blood transfusion practices are needed in African countries.
33646305	Single-dose MGTA-145/plerixafor leads to efficient mobilization and in vivo transduction of HSCs with thalassemia correction in mice.	We have developed an in vivo hemopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene therapy approach without the need for myelosuppressive conditioning and autologous HSC transplantation. It involves HSC mobilization and IV injection of a helper-dependent adenovirus HDAd5/35++ vector system. The current mobilization regimen consists of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) injections over a 4-day period, followed by the administration of plerixafor/AMD3100. We tested a simpler, 2-hour, G-CSF-free mobilization regimen using truncated GRO-beta (MGTA-145; a CXCR2 agonist) and plerixafor in the context of in vivo HSC transduction in mice. The MGTA-145+plerixafor combination resulted in robust mobilization of HSCs. Importantly, compared with G-CSF+plerixafor, MGTA-145+plerixafor led to significantly less leukocytosis and no elevation of serum interleukin-6 levels and was thus likely to be less toxic. With both mobilization regimens, after in vivo selection with O6-benzylguanine (O6BG)/BCNU, stable GFP marking was achieved in >90% of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Genome-wide analysis showed random, multiclonal vector integration. In vivo HSC transduction after mobilization with MGTA-145+plerixafor in a mouse model for thalassemia resulted in >95% human gamma-globin+ erythrocytes at a level of 36% of mouse beta-globin. Phenotypic analyses showed a complete correction of thalassemia. The gamma-globin marking percentage and level were maintained in secondary recipients, further demonstrating that MGTA145+plerixafor mobilizes long-term repopulating HSCs. Our study indicates that brief exposure to MGTA-145+plerixafor may be advantageous as a mobilization regimen for in vivo HSC gene therapy applications across diseases, including thalassemia and sickle cell disease.
34548892	Use of herbal medicine by caregivers in the management of children with sickle cell disease in Mulago National Referral Hospital - Uganda.	INTRODUCTION: Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is the leading genetic disease in sub-Saharan Africa and therefore remains a global public health threat. Use of complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) most especially herbal medicine (HM) in chronic diseases such as sickle cell disease has widely been reported in Africa where advanced technologies are greatly lacking. Despite a large presence of the sickle cell disease in Uganda, the extent to which herbal medicines are used in management of children with sickle cell disease has not been documented. This study purposed to determine the prevalence of herbal medicine (HM) use and associated factors among caregivers of children with SCD at Mulago National Referral Hospital. METHODS: a total of 384 child caretakers were interviewed in a descriptive cross-sectional quantitative study conducted at the Mulago Sickle cell clinic in March 2019. Enrolment was done consecutively and a structured interviewer administered questionnaire administered to collect data from the caretakers which was managed using SPSS version 23. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify the factors associated with herbal medicine (HM) use. Factors with p-value <0.05 were regarded significant. RESULTS: the rate of herbal use was 77.6% (298 of 384 caregivers). At multivariate analysis, the odds of a caregiver who agreed that; HM cures symptoms faster than conventional medicine (CM) were 3 times those who disagreed with this statement (AOR =3.439, 95% CI: 1.447 - 8.176). The odds that a caregiver who agreed that HM has fewer side effects than CM were almost 4 times those that disagreed with this statement (AOR = 3.528, 95% CI: 1.917 -6.494). The odds that a caregiver who agreed that marketing HM through televisions adverts encourages HM use were 4 times those who disagreed with this statement (AOR = 4.185, 95% CI: 2.036 -8.603). CONCLUSION: this study reports a high prevalence of HM use among caregivers of children with SCD at Mulago Hospital, in Uganda. The practice is significantly influenced by caretakers  perception that HM cures symptoms faster than CM, has fewer side effects and that telemarketing has greatly facilitated its use over CM. More effort is therefore needed to encourage clinic attendances and CM use and limit the unfounded TV adverts on HM. There is also need for studies to identify the common HM used so that their efficacy and safety are well studied.
34686692	Significance of genetic modifiers of hemoglobinopathies leading towards precision medicine.	Hemoglobinopathies though a monogenic disorder, show phenotypic variability. Hence, understanding the genetics underlying the heritable sub-phenotypes of hemoglobinopathies, specific to each population, would be prognostically useful and could inform personalized therapeutics. This study aimed to evaluate the role of genetic modifiers leading to higher HbF production with cumulative impact of the modifiers on disease severity. 200 patients (100 beta-thalassemia homozygotes, 100 Sickle Cell Anemia), and 50 healthy controls were recruited. Primary screening followed with molecular analysis for confirming the beta-hemoglobinopathy was performed. Co-existing alpha-thalassemia and the polymorphisms located in 3 genetic loci linked to HbF regulation were screened. The most remarkable result was the association of SNPs with clinically relevant phenotypic groups. The gamma-globin gene promoter polymorphisms [- 158 C   T, + 25 G   A],BCL11A rs1427407 G   T, - 3 bp HBS1L-MYB rs66650371 and rs9399137 T   C polymorphisms were correlated with higher HbF, in group that has lower disease severity score (P < 0.00001), milder clinical presentation, and a significant delay in the age of the first transfusion. Our study emphasizes the complex genetic interactions underlying the disease phenotype that may be a prognostic marker for predicting the clinical severity and assist in disease management.
37859469	Cerebral hemodynamics and oxygenation in adult patients with sickle cell disease after stem cell transplantation.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is characterized by chronic hemolytic anemia associated with impaired cerebral hemodynamics and oxygen metabolism. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is currently the only curative treatment for patients with SCD. Whereas normalization of hemoglobin levels and hemolysis markers has been reported after HSCT, its effects on cerebral perfusion and oxygenation in adult SCD patients remain largely unexplored. This study investigated the effects of HSCT on cerebral blood flow (CBF), oxygen delivery, cerebrovascular reserve (CVR), oxygen extraction fraction (OEF), and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2 ) in 17 adult SCD patients (mean age: 25.0 +- 8.0, 6 females) before and after HSCT and 10 healthy ethnicity-matched controls (mean age: 28.0 +- 8.8, 6 females) using MRI. For the CVR assessment, perfusion scans were performed before and after acetazolamide as a vasodilatory stimulus. Following HSCT, gray and white matter (GM and WM) CBF decreased (p < .01), while GM and WM CVR increased (p < .01) compared with the baseline measures. OEF and CMRO2 also increased towards levels in healthy controls (p < .01). The normalization of cerebral perfusion and oxygen metabolism corresponded with a significant increase in hemoglobin levels and decreases in reticulocytes, total bilirubin, and LDH as markers of hemolysis (p < .01). This study shows that HSCT results in the normalization of cerebral perfusion and oxygen metabolism, even in adult patients with SCD. Future follow-up MRI scans will determine whether the observed normalization of cerebral hemodynamics and oxygen metabolism prevents new silent cerebral infarcts.
36155903	Sickle Cell Disease in Mauritania: epidemiological, clinical and therapeutic aspects about 135 cases.	OBJECTIVE: To describe the epidemiological, clinical and therapeutic characteristics of a series of sickle cell disease cases collected in Mauritania over a three-year period. METHODS: This is a descriptive study of the profile of sickle cell disease, diagnosed in Mauritania, from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2017, at the outpatient clinics of the National Hospital Center and at the Mauritanian Association for the Support of Sickle Cell Patients. Patients were included following diagnostic confirmation by hemoglobin electrophoresis. RESULTS: During the study period, a total of 135 patients were included (79 female and 56 male), i.e. a sex ratio of 0.7 and an average age of 24 years (extremes: 9 months -77 years). All Mauritanian ethnic groups were affected by sickle cell disease, mainly the Peulths (63.7%). Sickle cell disease was found in eight wilayas, particularly Brakna (39%). The age of diagnosis was between 3 and 5 years, in 48% of patients. Sickle cell disease was discovered at the stage of complications in twelve patients. There are three types of sickle cell phenotypes: SS (54%), AS (40%) and SC (6%). In addition to transfusion, preventive treatment consisted of folic acid (n=53), hydroxyurea (n=14), and long-term antibiotic prophylaxis (n=3). CONCLUSION: The profile of sickle cell disease in Mauritania remains attributed to the lack of an active screening strategy and rapid diagnosis, hence the importance of developing a national program for early detection and management.

34043300	Targeting Kca3.1 Channels in Cancer.	The Kca3.1 channels, previously designated as IK1 or SK4 channels and encoded by the KCNN4 gene, are activated by a rise of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration. These K+ channels are widely expressed in many organs and involved in many pathologies. In particular, Kca3.1 channels have been studied intensively in the context of cancer. They are not only a marker and a valid prognostic tool for cancer patients, but have an important share in driving cancer progression. Their function is required for many characteristic features of the aggressive cancer cell behavior such as migration, invasion and metastasis as well as proliferation and therapy resistance. In the context of cancer, another property of Kca3.1 is now emerging. These channels can be a target for novel small molecule-based imaging probes, as it has been validated in case of fluorescently labeled senicapoc-derivatives. The aim of this review is (i) to give an overview on the role of Kca3.1 channels in cancer progression and in shaping the cancer microenvironment, (ii) discuss the potential of using Kca3.1 targeting drugs for cancer imaging, (iii) and highlight the possibility of combining molecular dynamics simulations to image inhibitor binding to Kca3.1 channels in order to provide a deeper understanding of Kca3.1 channel pharmacology. Alltogether, Kca3.1 is an attractive therapeutic target so that senicapoc, originally developed for the treatment of sickle cell anemia, should be repurposed for the treatment of cancer patients.
38237001	Perspectives of Adolescents and Young Adults With Sickle Cell Disease and Clinicians on Improving Transition Readiness With a Video Game Intervention.	We aimed to learn the experiences of clinicians and adolescents and young adults with sickle cell disease (AYA-SCD) with managing their disease at home and making medical decisions as they transition from pediatric to adult care, and their perceptions of a video game intervention to positively impact these skills. We conducted individual, semistructured interviews with patients (AYA-SCD ages 15 to 26 years) and clinicians who provide care to AYA-SCD at an urban, quaternary-care hospital. Interviews elicited patients' and clinicians' experiences with AYA-SCD, barriers and facilitators to successful home management, and their perspectives on shared decision-making and a video game intervention. To identify themes, we conducted an inductive analysis until data saturation was reached. Participants (16 patients and 21 clinicians) identified 4 main themes: (1) self-efficacy as a critical skill for a successful transition from pediatric to adult care, (2) the importance of patient engagement in making medical decisions, (3) multilevel determinants of optimal self-efficacy and patient engagement, and (4) support for a video game intervention which, by targeting potential determinants of AYA-SCD achieving optimal self-efficacy and engagement in decision-making, may improve these important skills.
35681538	Hematopoietic Stem Cell Gene-Addition/Editing Therapy in Sickle Cell Disease.	Autologous hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-targeted gene therapy provides a one-time cure for various genetic diseases including sickle cell disease (SCD) and beta-thalassemia. SCD is caused by a point mutation (20A > T) in the beta-globin gene. Since SCD is the most common single-gene disorder, curing SCD is a primary goal in HSC gene therapy. beta-thalassemia results from either the absence or the reduction of beta-globin expression, and it can be cured using similar strategies. In HSC gene-addition therapy, patient CD34+ HSCs are genetically modified by adding a therapeutic beta-globin gene with lentiviral transduction, followed by autologous transplantation. Alternatively, novel gene-editing therapies allow for the correction of the mutated beta-globin gene, instead of addition. Furthermore, these diseases can be cured by gamma-globin induction based on gene addition/editing in HSCs. In this review, we discuss HSC-targeted gene therapy in SCD with gene addition as well as gene editing.
36623245	Secondary Neoplasms After Hematopoietic Cell Transplant for Sickle Cell Disease.	PURPOSE: To report the incidence and risk factors for secondary neoplasm after transplantation for sickle cell disease. METHODS: Included are 1,096 transplants for sickle cell disease between 1991 and 2016. There were 22 secondary neoplasms. Types included leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS; n = 15) and solid tumor (n = 7). Fine-Gray regression models examined for risk factors for leukemia/MDS and any secondary neoplasm. RESULTS: The 10-year incidence of leukemia/MDS was 1.7% (95% CI, 0.90 to 2.9) and of any secondary neoplasm was 2.4% (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.8). After adjusting for other risk factors, risks for leukemia/MDS (hazard ratio, 22.69; 95% CI, 4.34 to 118.66; P = .0002) or any secondary neoplasm (hazard ratio, 7.78; 95% CI, 2.20 to 27.53; P = .0015) were higher with low-intensity (nonmyeloablative) regimens compared with more intense regimens. All low-intensity regimens included total-body irradiation (TBI 300 or 400 cGy with alemtuzumab, TBI 300 or 400 cGy with cyclophosphamide, TBI 200, 300, or 400 cGy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, or TBI 200 cGy with fludarabine). None of the patients receiving myeloablative and only 23% of those receiving reduced-intensity regimens received TBI. CONCLUSION: Low-intensity regimens rely on tolerance induction and establishment of mixed-donor chimerism. Persistence of host cells exposed to low-dose radiation triggering myeloid malignancy is one plausible etiology. Pre-existing myeloid mutations and prior inflammation may also contribute but could not be studied using our data source. Choosing conditioning regimens likely to result in full-donor chimerism may in part mitigate the higher risk for leukemia/MDS.
36377544	Red blood cell alloimmunisation in sickle cell disease patients in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.	OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of red blood cell (RBC) alloimmunisation and alloantibody specificity in sickle cell disease (SCD) patients in Kisangani, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in comparison with those followed at the Centre Hospitalier Regional (CHR) de la Citadelle of Liege (Belgium). BACKGROUND: Data regarding RBC alloimmunisation (immune response of the organism to foreign erythrocyte antigens, antigens that lack on its own RBC) in SCD patients are scarce in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: We conducted a multi-site-based cross-sectional study among 125 SCD patients at Kisangani and 136 at the CHR de la Citadelle of Liege. The diagnosis of SCD was confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Alloantibodies were screened using the agglutination technique on gel cards and their specificity determined using 11 and/or 16 cell panels. Statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS. RESULTS: The prevalence of RBC alloimmunisation was 9.6% among SCD patients in Kisangani versus 22.8% in those of Liege. At Kisangani as well as at Liege, the median age of alloimmunised patients was higher than that of non-alloimmunised patients, 15.5 years (IQR:4.8-19.8) and 24 years (IQR:14-31) versus 10 years (IQR: 6.5-17) and 17 years (IQR:12-24), respectively. The median number of blood units was higher in both Kisangani and Liege immunised patients compared to non-immunised patients, 8 (IQR:5-11) versus 5 (IQR:3-13) and 41(IQR:6-93) versus 6.5(3-37) respectively. At Kisangani (N = 14), the most frequent antibodies were anti-D (28.6%) and anti-C versus anti-E (13.6%), anti-S (13.6%) and anti-Lea (11.4%) at Liege (N = 44). CONCLUSIONS: These findings stated that alloimmunisation is a common complication in SCD patients in the DRC. In the resource-limited setting of this country, blood transfusion with minimal ABO, D, C and E antigen matching in addition to the use of compatibility test could significantly reduce the incidence of this complication.
32019737	"Dual-gene" malaria-resistance: Therapeutically-rational exchange (T-REX) of group-O sickle trait and group-O C-traittrait red blood cells can be evaluated in Benin and Nigeria.	BACKGROUND: Using indicators of disease severity, clinicians can predict which Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) malaria patients being treated with artesunate or quinine are likely to die despite these drugs. Effective "rescue adjuncts" are needed when drugs alone are inadequate. "Therapeutically-rational exchange" (T-REX) of special malaria-resistant red blood cells (RBCs) has been proposed to optimize adjunctive exchange transfusion. METHODS: Studies were reviewed that (1) quantified how group-O status and "sickle-trait" (HbAS) and "C-trait" (HbAC) hemoglobins affect Pf mortality, risk of thrombosis, or birth outcomes for women with pregnancy associated malaria (PAM), (2) reported prevalences of "dual-gene" malaria-resistant RBCs, or (3) reflected the level of exchange-transfusion and malaria-related expertise in Benin and Nigeria. RESULTS: Data show that the malaria- and thrombosis-resistance of RBCs depend on specific genes and the patient's clinical status and medical history. In malaria-endemic Benin and Nigeria, prevalences of "dual-gene" malaria-resistant group-O HbAS and group-O HbAC RBCs are substantial, and both malaria- and exchange-related expertise are outstanding. CONCLUSIONS: T-REX of "dual-gene" malaria-resistant RBCs is feasible in Benin and Nigeria and warrants evaluation as a rescue adjunct for 3 subsets of Pf-malaria patients. For therapeutic use, group-O HbAS RBCs are likely to be more effective than non-O HbAS RBCs for Pf-infected patients who (1) have a history of thrombosis or (2) are taking birth-control hormones while group-O HbAC RBCs may substantially improve birth outcomes for women with PAM. Studies suggest it is prudent to assume - until proven otherwise - that T-REX of "dual-gene" malaria-resistant RBCs can improve ("personalize") rescue of these patient subsets.

36468659	Red cell exchange transfusions increase cerebral capillary transit times and may alter oxygen extraction in sickle cell disease.	Persons with sickle cell disease (SCD) suffer from chronic hemolytic anemia, reduced blood oxygen content, and lifelong risk of silent and overt stroke. Major conventional stroke risk factors are absent in most individuals with SCD, yet nearly 50% have evidence of brain infarcts by the age of 30 years, indicating alternative etiologies for ischemia. We investigated whether radiological evidence of accelerated blood water transit through capillaries, visible on arterial spin labeling (ASL) magnetic resonance imaging, reduces following transfusion-induced increases in hemoglobin and relates to oxygen extraction fraction (OEF). Neurological evaluation along with anatomical and hemodynamic imaging with cerebral blood flow (CBF)-weighted pseudocontinuous ASL and OEF imaging with T2 -relaxation-under-spin-tagging were applied in sequence before and after blood transfusion therapy (n = 32) and in a comparator cohort of nontransfused SCD participants on hydroxyurea therapy scanned at two time points to assess stability without interim intervention (n = 13). OEF was calculated separately using models derived from human hemoglobin-F, hemoglobin-A, and hemoglobin-S. Gray matter CBF and dural sinus signal, indicative of rapid blood transit, were evaluated at each time point and compared with OEF using paired statistical tests (significance: two-sided p < 0.05). No significant change in sinus signal was observed in nontransfused participants (p = 0.650), but a reduction was observed in transfused participants (p = 0.034), consistent with slower red cell transit following transfusion. The dural sinus signal intensity was inversely associated with OEF pretransfusion (p = 0.011), but not posttransfusion. Study findings suggest that transfusion-induced increases in total hemoglobin may lengthen blood transit times through cerebral capillaries and alter cerebral OEF in SCD.
32928464	A Multiyear Cross-sectional Study of Guideline Adherence for the Timeliness of Opioid Administration in Children With Sickle Cell Pain Crisis.	STUDY OBJECTIVE: The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute evidence-based guidelines for timeliness of opioid administration for sickle cell disease (SCD) pain crises recommend an initial opioid within 1 hour of arrival, with subsequent dosing every 30 minutes until pain is controlled. No multisite studies have evaluated guideline adherence, to our knowledge. Our objective was to determine guideline adherence across a multicenter network. METHODS: We conducted a multiyear cross-sectional analysis of children with SCD who presented between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2018, to 7 emergency departments (EDs) within the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network. Visits for uncomplicated pain crisis were included, defined with an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) and ICD-10 code for SCD crisis and receipt of an opioid, excluding visits with other SCD complications or temperature exceeding 38.5 C (101.3 F). Times were extracted from the electronic record. Guideline adherence was assessed across sites and calendar years. RESULTS: A total of 4,578 visits were included. The median time to first opioid receipt was 62 minutes (interquartile range 42 to 93 minutes); between the first and second opioid receipt, 60 minutes (interquartile range 39 to 93 minutes). Overall, 48% of visits (95% confidence interval 47% to 50%) were guideline adherent for first opioid. Of 3,538 visits with a second opioid, 15% (95% confidence interval 14% to 16%) were guideline adherent. Site variation in adherence existed for time to first opioid (range 22% to 70%) and time between first and second opioid (range 2% to 36%; both P<.001). There was no change in timeliness to first dose or time between doses across years (P>.05 for both). CONCLUSION: Guideline adherence for timeliness of SCD treatment is poor, with half of visits adherent for time to first opioid and one seventh adherent for second dose. Dissemination and implementation research/quality improvement efforts are critical to improve care across EDs.
37235738	Transfusion in hemoglobinopathies and red blood cell alloimmunization: data from Sicily, Sardinia and Malta.	BACKGROUND: Hemoglobinopathies are a group of diseases that include those due to globin gene mutations, such as thalassemia major (TM) and thalassemia intermedia (TI) or due to alteration of hemoglobin structure such as sickle cell disease (SCD), as well as a combination of these conditions such as thalasso-drepanocytosis (TD). They constitute the most frequent hereditary anemias requiring blood transfusion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In April 2022, a questionnaire was sent to the Transfusion Services (TS) of Sicily, Sardinia and the Maltese National Blood Transfusion (MNBT) service. The questionnaire was divided into a generic part including the number of patients followed and the type of hemoglobinopathy, and a section relating to transfusion therapy, including the number of units transfused, whether red blood cells (RBC) were washed and, finally, a section relating to the presence or absence of alloantibodies and their identification. RESULTS: Data was retrieved for 2,574 patients: 68.6% TM, 15.4% TI, 10.3% TD, 4.1% SCD, and 1.6% other hemoglobinopathies (OHA). The number of RBC units transfused was 76,974, equivalent to 24.5% of all the RBCU transfused from the total number of patients followed. The number of washed RBCU was 21.1% of all the units used; 337 patients (37%) were diagnosed with alloantibodies, the majority of which were patients with SCD (20.6%). Of the 485 alloantibodies found, 90.3% were identified. The antibodies found most frequently were related to the Kell system (41.7%) followed by antibodies to the Rhesus system (37.9%); 29.7% of patients had more than one antibody. DISCUSSION: From our study, certain indications can be formulated: 1) complete the National Registry for patients with hemoglobinopathies; 2) create a Registry of alloimmunized patients to ensure transfusion therapy is as safe as possible, considering antibody evanescence; and 3) increase the recruitment of blood donors of diverse ethnicities.

37800996	Outcomes and long-term effects of hematopoietic stem cell transplant in sickle cell disease.	INTRODUCTION: Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is the only readily available curative option for sickle cell disease (SCD). Cure rates following human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched related donor HSCT with myeloablative or non-myeloablative conditioning are > 90%. Alternative donor sources, including haploidentical donor and autologous with gene therapy, expand donor options but are limited by inferior outcomes, limited data, and/or shorter follow-up and therefore remain experimental. AREAS COVERED: Outcomes are improving with time, with donor type and conditioning regimens having the greatest impact on long-term complications. Patients with stable donor engraftment do not experience SCD-related symptoms and have stabilization or improvement of end-organ pathology; however, the long-term effects of curative strategies remain to be fully established and have significant implications in a patient's decision to seek therapy. This review covers currently published literature on HSCT outcomes, including organ-specific outcomes implicated in SCD, as well as long-term effects. EXPERT OPINION: HSCT, both allogeneic and autologous gene therapy, in the SCD population reverses the sickle phenotype, prevents further organ damage, can resolve prior organ dysfunction in both pediatric and adult patients. Data support greater success with HSCT at a younger age, thus, curative therapies should be discussed early in the patient's life.
34286896	Transition care continuity promotes long-term retention in adult care among young adults with sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Care continuity prevents increased health care utilization and mortality during transition from pediatric to adult care. Our program employs a co-located care delivery model, in which pediatric provider involvement continues during young adulthood. We tested the hypothesis that individuals who participated in the co-located model have greater retention in adult care compared to those who only received pediatric transition services. METHODS: This study consisted of 311 youth with SCD (51.4% male; 63.0% HbSS/HbSbeta0 -thalassemia) who transferred to adult care from 2007 to 2017. Retention was defined as continuation with an adult provider for >=12 or >=24 months post-pediatric care. Logistic regression estimated the association between co-location status and retention at 12 and 24 months. Logistic regression and t-tests were used to evaluate potential predictors of retention in adult care. RESULTS: Individuals who participated in the co-location model were 1.9 times more likely to remain in adult care 12 (95% CI: 1.01, 3.47) and 24 (95% CI: 1.01, 3.70) months post-pediatric care compared to those who did not participate. Individuals with HbSS/HbSbeta0 -thalassemia were 1.9 times more likely to be retained at 12 months compared to those with HbSC/HbSbeta+ -thalassemia/HbS/HPFH (95% CI: 1.12, 3.09). For every clinic encounter in the last 2 years of pediatric care, the odds of being retained at least 24 months after initiating adult care increased 1.1 times (95% CI: 1.02, 1.13). CONCLUSIONS: Continuity of providers from pediatric to adult care may increase long-term retention in adult care. Longitudinal monitoring of adult outcomes is critical to identifying the efficacy of transition services.
35318744	Preventing antibody positive delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions in sickle cell disease: Lessons learned from a case.	INTRODUCTION: Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions are important in the management of patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). However, a potentially catastrophic complication of transfusion in this population is the delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction (DHTR). The pathophysiology of all DHTRs is not understood, but some are known to be caused by an anamnestic resurgence of RBC alloantibodies. CASE PRESENTATION: A child with SCD transfused for acute chest syndrome re-presented a week after hospital discharge with severe anaemia, hemolysis, and a newly detected anti-E. This patient had been previously transfused years ago at an outside institution and the anti-E had not been previously documented. DISCUSSION: The presented case of an antibody positive DHTR illustrates several concepts critical to the prevention of this complication. RBC alloantibodies must be detected and this information must be shared. Prophylactic C/c, E/e, K antigen matching is helpful for patients with SCD, but systems must be in place to identify these patients. Patients transfused at multiple different hospitals are especially at risk for this complication and efforts are needed to prevent them from suffering a DHTR.

33425160	[Administration of analgesics at home for the treatment of vaso-occlusive crises before admission to hospital].	INTRODUCTION: vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs) are the primary reason for admission and hospitalization in children with sickle cell disease and most often they require home care before arriving to consultation. The purpose of this study was to describe home-based therapy for children with sickle cell disease admitted with VOCs. METHODS: we conducted a descriptive and analytical cross-sectional study, in the pediatric emergencies at the Mother and Child Centre of the Chantal Biya Foundation (CBF) over a 4-month period from February to May 2018. Consecutive sampling was used. All patients with sickle cell disease presenting with VOCs were included in the study. RESULTS: one hundred and fifty-two patients were enrolled. The most represented age group was 5- 10 years. Eighty-two patients (54%) presented more than 24 hours after the onset of the crises and 70 (46%) in the first 24 hours; 80% (n=122) of our sample had received analgesic treatment at home. Escalation of therapy was found in 31.2% of cases. The use of prescription medications (75.4%, n=92) was dominant as the 1st recourse. The dosage for analgesics was not correct in 67% of cases (overdose in 70% of cases). The correct dosage of home-based analgesics was administered in only 33% of patients. CONCLUSION: this study shows that home-based management of VOCs is inadequate. Measures must be taken to ensure that all patients with sickle cell disease can effectively manage minor to moderate VOCs at home.
35110690	Significant improvement of child physical and emotional functioning after familial haploidentical stem cell transplant.	Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (AlloSCT) represents the only curative therapy for sickle cell disease (SCD). However, limited availability of matched related donors and suboptimal outcomes following AlloSCT with unrelated donors has led to investigation of alternative donors. Among children with high-risk SCD, we evaluated health-related quality of life (HRQoL) impact in the two years following familial haploidentical SCT. HRQoL was collected from parent and child raters, using the Child Health Ratings Inventories Generic measure and haploidentical SCT-specific module. Repeated measures models were fit to assess HRQoL changes over time and by rater. Nineteen children (mean age 12.9 yrs [standard deviation, 5.3]; 63% male) and their parents were included. There were no differences in the 2-yr trajectories of child physical or emotional functioning (EF) by rater. Child physical functioning and EF scores were significantly lower at day +45 than baseline, but scores recovered by day +180. There was significant improvement in EF (p = 0.03) at 2 yrs vs baseline. A similar pattern of scores over time was seen for parent ratings of child's global HRQoL. Despite treatment intensity in the initial months following AlloSCT, patient scores recovered or exceeded baseline scores at two years. This trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01461837).
35020514	Evolving Strategies in the Management of Sickle Cell Disease in the 21st Century and the Role of the Pediatrician.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the most common genetic disorders in the United States. Once a fatal disease of childhood, the majority of patients born with SCD who live in a developed country will survive to adulthood (albeit with slightly shortened life spans). Despite numerous novel therapeutic advancements in recent years that serve to mitigate the symptoms associated with SCD, the only cure for SCD is a hematopoietic stem cell transplant. The overall survival for patients with a matched sibling donor transplant is greater than 90%. However, fewer than 20% of patients with SCD in the US have a 12/12 human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched sibling donor. In contrast, most patients have at least one HLA haploidentical first-degree relative, which expands the donor pool for patients who have diseases amenable to stem cell transplantation such as SCD. [Pediatr Ann. 2022;51(1):e34-e39.].
38710015	Reversibility of Cognitive Deficits and Functional Connectivity With Transfusion in Children With Sickle Cell Disease.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: People with sickle cell disease (SCD) are at risk of cognitive dysfunction independent of stroke. Diminished functional connectivity in select large-scale networks and white matter integrity reflect the neurologic consequences of SCD. Because chronic transfusion therapy is neuroprotective in preventing stroke and strengthening executive function abilities in people with SCD, we hypothesized that red blood cell (RBC) transfusion facilitates the acute reversal of disruptions in functional connectivity while white matter integrity remains unaffected. METHODS: Children with SCD receiving chronic transfusion therapy underwent a brain MRI measuring white matter integrity with diffusion tensor imaging and resting-state functional connectivity within 3 days before and after transfusion of RBCs. Cognitive assessments with the NIH Toolbox were acquired after transfusion and then immediately before the following transfusion cycle. RESULTS: Sixteen children with a median age of 12.5 years were included. Global assessments of functional connectivity using homotopy (p = 0.234) or modularity (p = 0.796) did not differ with transfusion. Functional connectivity within the frontoparietal network significantly strengthened after transfusion (median intranetwork Z-score 0.21 [0.17-0.30] before transfusion, 0.29 [0.20-0.36] after transfusion, p < 0.001), while there was not a significant change seen within the sensory motor, visual, auditory, default mode, dorsal attention, or cingulo-opercular networks. Corresponding to the change within the frontoparietal network, there was a significant improvement in executive function abilities after transfusion (median executive function composite score 87.7 [81.3-90.7] before transfusion, 90.3 [84.3-93.7] after transfusion, p = 0.021). Participants with stronger connectivity in the frontoparietal network before transfusion had a significantly greater improvement in the executive function composite score with transfusion (r = 0.565, 95% CI 0.020-0.851, p = 0.044). While functional connectivity and executive abilities strengthened with transfusion, there was not a significant change in white matter integrity as assessed by fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity within 16 white matter tracts or globally with tract-based spatial statistics. DISCUSSION: Strengthening of functional connectivity with concomitant improvement in executive function abilities with transfusion suggests that functional connectivity MRI could be used as a biomarker for acutely reversible neurocognitive injury as novel therapeutics are developed for people with SCD.
34086867	Enhanced HbF reactivation by multiplex mutagenesis of thalassemic CD34+ cells in vitro and in vivo.	Thalassemia or sickle cell patients with hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) have an ameliorated clinical phenotype and, in some cases, can achieve transfusion independence. Inactivation via genome editing of gamma-globin developmental suppressors, such as BCL11A or LRF/ZBTB7A, or of their binding sites, have been shown to significantly increase expression of endogenous HbF. To broaden the therapeutic window beyond a single-editing approach, we have explored combinations of cis- and trans-editing targets to enhance HbF reactivation. Multiplex mutagenesis in adult CD34+ cells was well tolerated and did not lead to any detectable defect in the cells' proliferation and differentiation, either in vitro or in vivo. The combination of 1 trans and 1 cis mutation resulted in high editing retention in vivo, coupled with almost pancellular HbF expression in NBSGW mice. The greater in vivo performance of this combination was also recapitulated using a novel helper-dependent adenoviral-CRISPR vector (HD-Ad-dualCRISPR) in CD34+ cells from beta-thalassemia patients transplanted to NBSGW mice. A pronounced increase in HbF expression was observed in human red blood cells in mice with established predominant beta0/beta0-thalassemic hemopoiesis after in vivo injection of the HD-Ad-dualCRISPR vector. Collectively, our data suggest that the combination of cis and trans fetal globin reactivation mutations has the potential to significantly increase HbF both totally and on a per cell basis over single editing and could thus provide significant clinical benefit to patients with severe beta-globin phenotype.
34963615	Combined preoperative plasma exchange and red blood cell exchange transfusion in a renal transplant patient with protein S deficiency and hemoglobin SC disease.	BACKGROUND: Protein S deficiency is associated with increased risk of venous thromboembolism, complicating the perioperative management of such patients. We present a patient with sickle cell disease (Hb SC genotype) and inherited protein S deficiency who underwent a living-donor renal transplant. To minimize thrombotic risk and sickle cell complications, both plasma exchange and red blood cell (RBC) exchange transfusion were performed pre-operatively. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Plasma exchange was utilized to increase protein S levels and to reduce the risk of post-operative venous thromboembolism, including allograft thrombosis, while RBC exchange was performed to reduce the risk of acute post-operative sickle cell disease complications. RESULTS: With the use of combined pre-operative plasma exchange and RBC exchange transfusion, this patient with protein S deficiency and Hb SC underwent a successful renal transplant without acute sickle cell complications or thrombotic complications. CONCLUSIONS: This case demonstrates the potential use of pre-operative plasma exchange in patients with protein S deficiency undergoing high thrombotic risk procedures.
33749717	A Budget Impact Analysis of Gene Therapy for Sickle Cell Disease: The Medicaid Perspective.	Importance: Hundreds of gene therapies are undergoing clinical testing and are likely to be priced more than $1 million per course of treatment. The association that high prices will have with insurance coverage of gene therapy remains unclear. Gene therapy for sickle cell disease has shown early success and would be one of the first gene therapies available for a relatively large population. Objectives: To estimate the budget impact and affordability of a gene therapy for severe sickle cell disease from the perspective of US Medicaid programs with the highest prevalence of sickle cell disease while exploring the impact of an annuity payment model. Design, Setting, and Participants: A budget impact analysis was performed from January 1 to May 31, 2020, for a sickle cell disease gene therapy from the perspective of 10 state Medicaid plans with a 5-year time horizon, using state-level disease prevalence data from 2012. Disease prevalence, Medicaid enrollment, and expenditures were derived from the available literature. The eligible population was based on modified clinical trial inclusion criteria including individuals aged 13 to 45 years with severe disease. Exposures: The gene therapy was assumed to be administered to 7% of the eligible population annually and was curative (no subsequent disease-related expenditures). The gene therapy price was $1.85 million in the base case, and baseline disease-related expenditures were $42 200 per year. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcomes were total budget impact and budget impact per member per month in years 1 through 5. One-way sensitivity analysis was used to evaluate uncertainty of market diffusion, size of eligible population, price of therapy, and cost of routine care. Results: An estimated 5464 Medicaid enrollees would be eligible for the gene therapy nationally, with 2315 individuals in the 10 Medicaid programs of interest (16 per 100 000 enrollees). The model projected a mean 1-year budget impact of $29.96 million per state Medicaid program in the sample ($1.91 per member per month). A 5-year annuity payment reduced the short-term budget impact. Conclusions and Relevance: This study suggests that a gene therapy for severe sickle cell disease is likely to produce a considerable budget impact for many Medicaid plans while potentially offering substantial benefit to patients. Payers may need to take steps to ensure affordability and access. Gene therapy for sickle cell disease is likely to provide an early demonstration of the unique financial challenges associated with this emerging drug class.
36040789	Characterizing User Engagement With a Digital Intervention for Pain Self-management Among Youth With Sickle Cell Disease and Their Caregivers: Subanalysis of a Randomized Controlled Trial.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is characterized by severe acute pain episodes as well as risk for chronic pain. Digital delivery of SCD pain self-management support may enhance pain self-management skills and accessibility for youth. However, little is known about how youth with SCD and their caregivers engage with digital health programs. iCanCope with pain is a digital pain self-management platform adapted for youth with SCD and caregivers through a user-centered design approach. The program was delivered via a website (separate versions for youth and caregiver) and mobile app (youth only). OBJECTIVE: We aimed to characterize patterns of user engagement with the iCanCope with SCD program among youth with SCD and their caregivers. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was completed across multiple North American SCD clinics. Eligible youth were aged 12-18 years, diagnosed with SCD, English-speaking, and experiencing moderate-to-severe pain interference. Eligible caregivers were English-speaking with a child enrolled in the study. Dyads were randomized to receive the iCanCope intervention or attention-control education for 8-12 weeks. This report focused on engagement among dyads who received the intervention. User-level analytics were captured. Individual interviews were conducted with 20% of dyads. Descriptive statistics characterized quantitative engagement. Content analysis summarized qualitative interview data. Exploratory analysis tested the hypothesis that caregiver engagement would be positively associated with child engagement. RESULTS: The cohort included primarily female (60% [34/57] of youth; 91% [49/56] of caregivers) and Black (>90% of youth [53/57] and caregivers [50/56]) participants. Among 56 dyads given program access, differential usage patterns were observed: both the youth and caregiver engaged (16/56, 29%), only the youth engaged (24/56, 43%), only the caregiver engaged (1/56, 2%), and neither individual engaged (16/56, 29%). While most youth engaged with the program (40/57, 70%), most caregivers did not (39/56, 70%). Youth were more likely to engage with the app than the website (85% [34/57] versus 68% [23/57]), and the most popular content categories were goal setting, program introduction, and symptom history. Among caregivers, program introduction, behavioral plans, and goal setting were the most popular content areas. As hypothesized, there was a moderate positive association between caregiver and child engagement (chi21=6.6; P=.01; phi=0.34). Interviews revealed that most dyads would continue to use the program (11/12, 92%) and recommend it to others (10/12, 83%). The reasons for app versus website preference among youth were ease of use, acceptable time commitment, and interactivity. Barriers to caregiver engagement included high time burden and limited perceived relevance of content. CONCLUSIONS: This is one of the first studies to apply digital health analytics to characterize patterns of engagement with SCD self-management among youth and caregivers. The findings will be used to optimize the iCanCope with SCD program prior to release. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03201874; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03201874.
36635153	CRISPR-Cas9 base editors and their current role in human therapeutics.	BACKGROUND: Consistent progress has been made to create more efficient and useful CRISPR-Cas9-based molecular toolsfor genomic modification. METHODS: This review focuses on recent articles that have employed base editors (BEs) for both clinical and research purposes. RESULTS: CRISPR-Cas9 BEs are a useful system because of their highefficiency and broad applicability to gene correction and disruption. In addition, base editing has beensuggested as a safer approach than other CRISPR-Cas9-based systems, as it limits double-strand breaksduring multiplex gene knockout and does not require a toxic DNA donor molecule for genetic correction. CONCLUSION: As such, numerous industry and academic groups are currently developing base editing strategies withclinical applications in cancer immunotherapy and gene therapy, which this review will discuss, with a focuson current and future applications of in vivo BE delivery.
38737665	Laboratory predictors of sickle cell disease severity: a cross-sectional study.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common monogenic disorder, although the diversity and heterogenicity of clinical presentations render estimations of disease severity unpredictable. This cross-sectional study aimed to determine if laboratory markers could serve as indicators of SCD severity. We enrolled 90 adult patients with SCD with a mean age of 32.33 +- 11.84 years from the eastern province of Saudi Arabia, where SCD is more common than in other regions. Our study revealed a positive significant association between the number of hospitalizations and emergency visits with white blood cells (WBC) (R = 0.241, R = 0.207), respectively. Similarly, positive significant associations were found between the number of hospitalizations and emergency visits with platelets (R = 0.393, R = 0.276), respectively. Conversely, negative significant relationships were found between the number of hospitalizations and emergency visits (ER) with hemoglobin (Hb) F (R = -0.268, R = -0.263), respectively. Additionally, significant negative relationships were found between Hb F (R = -0.223) and the frequency of ICU admission. Only the number of hospitalizations and emergency visits annually were significantly predicted with P values of 0.021 and 0.038, respectively. Moreover, an increase in WBC was found to significantly increase the chance of undergoing splenectomy by 23.02%. SCD is a multisystemic disease with heterogeneous clinical presentations and disease severity. Inflammatory markers are valuable tools for better risk stratification and could be translated into developing new therapeutic strategies and modifying the treatment paradigm.
36441963	Diffuse myocardial fibrosis occurs in young patients with sickle cell anemia despite early disease-modifying therapy.	
34626431	Exercise-induced changes of vital signs in adults with sickle cell disease.	The six-minute walk test (6MWT) has been used in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), in conjunction with tricuspid regurgitant velocity (TRV) and plasma N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro BNP), to assess risk of having pulmonary hypertension. Exercise-induced vital sign changes (VSCs) are predictors of clinical outcomes in other diseases. In this study, we assess the predictors and prognostic value of 6MWT VSC in adult SCD patients. Data from a multinational study of SCD patients (Treatment of Pulmonary Hypertension with Sildenafil: walk-PHaSST) were used to calculate the 6MWT VSC. Predictors of VSC were identified by a multivariable analysis, and a survival analysis was conducted by the Cox proportional hazard method. An increase in heart rate was observed in 90% of the 630 SCD adults, 77% of patients had an increase in systolic blood pressure (SBP), and 50% of patients had a decrease in oxygen saturation. TRV (odds ratio [OR] = 1.82, p = .020), absolute reticulocyte count (OR = 1.03, p < .001), and hemoglobin (OR = 0.99, p = .035) predicted oxygen desaturation >= 3% during the 6MWT. In the adjusted analysis, SBP increase during the 6MWT was associated with improved survival (hazards ratio = 0.3, 95% confidence interval: 0.1-0.8). Increases in heart rate and blood pressure, as well as oxygen desaturation, are common in adults with SCD during the 6MWT. VSC is associated with markers of anemia and TRV and can be used for risk stratification. Any increase in SBP during the 6MWT was associated with improved survival and may be indicative of a patient's ability to increase stroke volume.
34238241	Community based screening for sickle haemoglobin among pregnant women in Benue State, Nigeria: I-Care-to-Know, a Healthy Beginning Initiative.	BACKGROUND: Haemoglobin genotype screening at prenatal care offers women an opportunity to be aware of their genotype, receive education on sickle cell disease (SCD) and may increase maternal demand for SCD newborn screening. In developed countries, most pregnant women who access prenatal care and deliver at the hospital receive haemoglobin genotype screening. In settings with low prenatal care attendance and low hospital deliveries, community-based screening may provide similar opportunity for pregnant women. We assessed the feasibility and acceptability of integrating haemoglobin genotype screening into an existing community-based HIV program. METHODS: Onsite community-based integrated testing for HIV, hepatitis B virus and haemoglobin electrophoresis, were conducted for pregnant women and their male partners. Community Health Advisors implementing the NIH and PEPFAR-supported Healthy Beginning Initiative (HBI) program provided education on SCD, collected blood sample for haemoglobin electrophoresis and provided test results to participants enrolled into the HBI program. We concurrently conducted a cross-sectional study using a pretested, semi-structured, interviewer administered questionnaire to collect demographic data and assess awareness of individual haemoglobin "genotype" among HBI pregnant women participants. RESULTS: In this study, 99.9% (10,167/10,168) of pregnant women who received education on SCD accepted and completed the survey, had blood drawn for haemoglobin electrophoresis and received their results. A majority of participating pregnant women (97.0%) were not aware of their haemoglobin "genotype". Among the participants who were incorrect about their haemoglobin "genotype", 41.1% (23/56) of women who reported their haemoglobin "genotype" as AA were actually AS. The odds of haemoglobin "genotype" awareness was higher among participants who were in younger age group, completed tertiary education, had less number of pregnancies, and attended antenatal care. Overall prevalence of sickle cell trait (AS) was 18.7%. CONCLUSIONS: It is feasible to integrate haemoglobin "genotype" testing into an existing community-based maternal-child program. Most pregnant women who were unaware of their haemoglobin "genotype" accepted and had haemoglobin genotype testing, and received their test results. Increasing parental awareness of their own haemoglobin "genotype" could increase their likelihood of accepting newborn screening for SCD.
31642065	Posttransfusion hyperhemolysis is arrested by targeting macrophage activation with novel use of Tocilizumab.	BACKGROUND: Hyperhemolysis syndrome (HHS) is a posttransfusion complication most frequently seen in sickle cell disease (SCD), characterized by rapid destruction of transfused and autologous red blood cells (RBCs), resulting in reticulocytopenia and a decrease in hemoglobin to below pretransfusion levels. Additional RBC transfusion can be life threatening. Most patients improve with intravenous immune globulin and steroids, but in refractory cases, hyperhemolysis may result in multiorgan failure and death in the absence of salvage therapy. The exact pathophysiology of HHS remains uncertain, yet new insights suggest that RBC destruction is driven by activated macrophages. Therefore, we propose that antimacrophage therapy may represent an effective treatment. CASE REPORT: A case of life-threatening HHS, refractory to intravenous immune globulin and steroids, in a patient with SCD is presented. Marked elevation in ferritin, an indirect marker of macrophage activation, a negative direct antiglobulin test, and the absence of RBC alloantibodies was noted. A hemoglobin nadir of 2.1 g/dL and resultant hypoxemia-induced organ failure prompted the use of tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 receptor monoclonal antibody. Hemoglobin-based oxygen carrier-201, a cell-free polymerized bovine hemoglobin, was used to support the patient during critical anemia. RESULTS: Hemolysis resolved and ferritin dramatically decreased after administration of tocilizumab, which was well tolerated. A full recovery was achieved. CONCLUSION: This case highlights both a novel and successful approach to managing refractory transfusion-induced hyperhemolysis with tocilizumab and provides further evidence supporting the role for macrophage activation in the destruction of RBCs in antibody-negative HHS. We propose that tocilizumab is an effective and rapid salvage therapy for refractory HHS.
38661449	Exagamglogene Autotemcel for Severe Sickle Cell Disease.	BACKGROUND: Exagamglogene autotemcel (exa-cel) is a nonviral cell therapy designed to reactivate fetal hemoglobin synthesis by means of ex vivo clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 gene editing of autologous CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) at the erythroid-specific enhancer region of BCL11A. METHODS: We conducted a phase 3, single-group, open-label study of exa-cel in patients 12 to 35 years of age with sickle cell disease who had had at least two severe vaso-occlusive crises in each of the 2 years before screening. CD34+ HSPCs were edited with the use of CRISPR-Cas9. Before the exa-cel infusion, patients underwent myeloablative conditioning with pharmacokinetically dose-adjusted busulfan. The primary end point was freedom from severe vaso-occlusive crises for at least 12 consecutive months. A key secondary end point was freedom from inpatient hospitalization for severe vaso-occlusive crises for at least 12 consecutive months. The safety of exa-cel was also assessed. RESULTS: A total of 44 patients received exa-cel, and the median follow-up was 19.3 months (range, 0.8 to 48.1). Neutrophils and platelets engrafted in each patient. Of the 30 patients who had sufficient follow-up to be evaluated, 29 (97%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 83 to 100) were free from vaso-occlusive crises for at least 12 consecutive months, and all 30 (100%; 95% CI, 88 to 100) were free from hospitalizations for vaso-occlusive crises for at least 12 consecutive months (P<0.001 for both comparisons against the null hypothesis of a 50% response). The safety profile of exa-cel was generally consistent with that of myeloablative busulfan conditioning and autologous HSPC transplantation. No cancers occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with exa-cel eliminated vaso-occlusive crises in 97% of patients with sickle cell disease for a period of 12 months or more. (CLIMB SCD-121; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03745287.).
34889416	Indications for transfusion in the management of sickle cell disease.	The transfusion of red blood cells (RBCs) is a crucial treatment for sickle cell disease (SCD). While often beneficial, the frequent use of transfusions is associated with numerous complications. Transfusions should be offered with specific guidelines in mind. Here we present updates to the indications for transfusion of RBCs in SCD. We review recent publications and include expert perspectives from hematology and transfusion medicine. For some clinical indications, such as ischemic stroke, the role of transfusion has been well studied and can be applied almost universally. For many other clinical scenarios, the use of transfusion therapy has less conclusive data and therefore must be tailored to individual needs. We highlight the roles of RBC transfusions in preventing or mitigating neurological disease, in reducing perioperative complications, in managing acute chest syndrome, and in optimizing pregnancy outcomes in SCD. We further highlight various transfusion techniques and when each might be considered. Potential complications of transfusion are also briefly discussed.

38066905	Using disease-modifying therapies in sickle cell disease.	As curative therapy using allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation as well as gene therapy and gene editing remains inaccessible to most patients with sickle cell disease, the availability of drug therapies that are safe, efficacious, and affordable is highly desirable. Increasing progress is being made in developing drug therapies based on our understanding of disease pathophysiology. Four drugs, hydroxyurea, L-glutamine, crizanlizumab, and voxelotor, are currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, with multiple others at various stages of testing. With the limited efficacy of individual agents, combinations of agents will likely be required for optimal outcomes.
32205784	Longitudinal Description of Gonadal Function in Sickle-cell Patients Treated With Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Using Alkylator-based Conditioning Regimens.	OBJECTIVES: This study describes the hormone profiles for gonadal late effects after alkylator-based hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) regimens used for sickle-cell disease (SCD). METHODS: This is a retrospective chart review of subjects followed in the post-HSCT clinic for sickle-cell disease. Patient demographics, pubertal development, characteristics of pre-HSCT disease severity, treatment before HSCT, conditioning regimens, presence of graft versus host disease and follicle-stimulating hormone, anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), luteinizing hormone and testosterone were abstracted from the medical record. RESULTS: Forty subjects (24 female individuals) with SCD were 9 (+-4.3) years old at HSCT and 7.9 years (+-5.6) from HSCT. At the time of transplant, 8% of female individuals and no male individuals were pubertal and 58% of female individuals and 38% of male individuals had been treated with hydroxyurea. Post-HSCT, all of the female individuals had diminished ovarian reserve on the basis of low AMH values and 10 of the pubertal female individuals (71%) had premature ovarian insufficiency defined as follicle-stimulating hormone >40 mIU/mL x2. There was no ovarian recovery and AMH remained very low or undetectable up to 13 years post-HSCT. In male individuals, luteinizing hormone and testosterone levels were normal for age. CONCLUSIONS: Post-HSCT for SCD, all female individuals had diminished ovarian reserve and most female individuals had POI, whereas male individuals had normal testosterone hormone production.
38538687	Brain network hypersensitivity underlies pain crises in sickle cell disease.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder causing painful and unpredictable Vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs) through blood vessel blockages. In this study, we propose explosive synchronization (ES) as a novel approach to comprehend the hypersensitivity and occurrence of VOCs in the SCD brain network. We hypothesized that the accumulated disruptions in the brain network induced by SCD might lead to strengthened ES and hypersensitivity. We explored ES's relationship with patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) as well as VOCs by analyzing EEG data from 25 SCD patients and 18 matched controls. SCD patients exhibited lower alpha frequency than controls. SCD patients showed correlation between frequency disassortativity (FDA), an ES condition, and three important PROMs. Furthermore, stronger FDA was observed in SCD patients with a higher frequency of VOCs and EEG recording near VOC. We also conducted computational modeling on SCD brain network to study FDA's role in network sensitivity. Our model demonstrated that a stronger FDA could be linked to increased sensitivity and frequency of VOCs. This study establishes connections between SCD pain and the universal network mechanism, ES, offering a strong theoretical foundation. This understanding will aid predicting VOCs and refining pain management for SCD patients.
34570224	Impact of a grant program to spur advances in sickle cell disease research.	More than 20 years ago, clinical trials and federal grant support for sickle cell disease (SCD) research were not on par with support for other genetic diseases. Faced with the opportunity to spur research and advance treatments for SCD, and at the recommendation of advisors, the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation (DDCF) offered an SCD research funding opportunity starting in 2009 through its Innovations in Clinical Research Awards (ICRA) program. Twenty-eight new grants of $450 000 for direct costs over 3 years and 7 renewals were awarded, for a total investment of $17 million. Only about half the research teams garnered follow-on funding directly related to their ICRA projects, but the financial return on the research investment was substantial (~4 times the original $17 million or 300%). All but 1 of the ICRA investigative teams published original research reports that acknowledged DDCF as a source of funding; the median number of publications per team was 3. Major innovations in the diagnosis and treatment of SCD included but were not limited to a demonstration that genetic modification of BCL11A enhancer is a potentially important treatment modality, establishment that plerixafor mobilization is safe and effective for those with SCD, development and validation of a new diagnostic called SCD BioChip, and evidence that hydroxyurea treatment is safe and efficacious in African children. These outcomes show that relatively small research grants can have a substantial return on investment and result in significant advances for a disease such as SCD.

34477545	Sickle cell disease children's gut colonization by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacterales: an antibiotic prophylaxis effect?	Introduction. Sickle cell disease (SCD) children have a high susceptibility to pneumococcal infection. For this reason, they are routinely immunized with pneumococcal vaccines and use antibiotic prophylaxis (AP).Hypothesis/Gap Statement. Yet, little is known about SCD children's gut microbiota. If antibiotic-resistant Enterobacterales may colonize people on AP, we hypothesized that SCD children on AP are colonized by resistant enterobacteria species.Objective. To evaluate the effect of continuous AP on Enterobacterales gut colonization from children with SCD.Methodology. We analysed 30 faecal swabs from SCD children on AP and 21 swabs from children without the same condition. Enterobacterales was isolated on MacConkey agar plates and identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) (bioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France). We performed the antibiogram by Vitek 2 system (bioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France), and the resistance genes were identified by multiplex PCR.Results. We found four different species with resistance to one or more different antibiotic types in the AP-SCD children's group: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii, and Citrobacter farmeri. Colonization by resistant E. coli was associated with AP (prevalence ratio 2.69, 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1.98-3.67, P<0.001). Strains producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) were identified only in SCD children, E. coli, 4/30 (13 %), and K. pneumoniae, 2/30 (7 %). The ESBL-producing Enterobacterales were associated with penicillin G benzathine use (95 % CI, 22.91-86.71, P<0.001). CTX-M-1 was the most prevalent among ESBL-producers (3/6, 50 %), followed by CTX-M-9 (2/6, 33 %), and CTX-M-2 (1/6, 17 %).Conclusion. Resistant enterobacteria colonize SCD children on AP, and this therapy raises the chance of ESBL-producing Enterobacterales colonization. Future studies should focus on prophylactic vaccines as exclusive therapy against pneumococcal infections.
33034129	Primary caregiver decision-making in hematopoietic cell transplantation and gene therapy for sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Improved outcomes and the availability of clinical trials of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) from alternate donors and genetically modified autologous hematopoietic progenitor cells have expanded the applicability of HCT for sickle cell disease (SCD). To understand the perspective of primary caregivers exploring HCT in the current milieu, we asked the research question "What motivates primary caregivers to decide to consider HCT and to seek, and to attend, an HCT consultation?" PROCEDURES: We conducted qualitative interviews with primary caregivers within one week after a consultation for HCT for SCD. Data were analyzed using open and axial coding stages of grounded theory methodology. RESULTS: We interviewed 29 primary caregivers (26 females, age 29 to 64 [median 42] years). Primary caregivers report of SCD complications in their child included at least one in the last year by 23 (82%), few or none by 8 (28%), and pain on >=3 days a week by 13 (46%) primary caregivers. Qualitative analysis revealed that primary caregivers, (i) learn about curative options through social networks, social media, and the news media; (ii) seek consultation because of their child's diminished quality of life, recent complications, an imminent major medical decision, or anxiety about future severe complications; and (iii) see gene therapy as a new, less invasive, and more acceptable treatment. CONCLUSION: Primary caregivers of children with SCD learn about HCT through social networks, social and news media, and explore HCT as a means to prevent SCD complications and help their child live a normal life.
31851237	Self-care deficits in women with leg ulcers and sickle cell disease.	OBJECTIVE: to identify self-care deficits in women with leg ulcers and sickle cell disease. METHOD: a qualitative, descriptive, exploratory approach with 14 women. The collection was performed from December 2015 to January 2016, while the analysis was supported by Orem's Self-Care Deficit Theory. RESULTS: self-care requirements are not fully met. The following were identified as universal: balance between loneliness and social interaction, rest and proper nutrition; development: inability to perform work, abrupt changes in the environment due to hospitalization, educational deprivation and dropout; health deviations: ulcer recurrences, pain, changes in skin appearance and gait changes. CONCLUSION: nursing care for women with leg ulcers and sickle cell disease requires planned actions for comprehensive care.
32973791	Heme Induces IL-6 and Cardiac Hypertrophy Genes Transcripts in Sickle Cell Mice.	Emerging data indicate that free heme promotes inflammation in many different disease settings, including in sickle cell disease (SCD). Although free heme, proinflammatory cytokines, and cardiac hypertrophy are co-existing features of SCD, no mechanistic links between these features have been demonstrated. We now report significantly higher levels of IL-6 mRNA and protein in hearts of the Townes sickle cell disease (SS) mice (2.9-fold, p <= 0.05) than control mice expressing normal human hemoglobin (AA). We find that experimental administration of heme 50 mumoles/kg body weight induces IL-6 expression directly in vivo and induces gene expression markers of cardiac hypertrophy in SS mice. We administered heme intravenously and found that within three hours plasma IL-6 protein significantly increased in SS mice compared to AA mice (3248 +- 275 vs. 2384 +- 255 pg/ml, p <= 0.05). In the heart, heme induced a 15-fold increase in IL-6 transcript in SS mice heart compared to controls. Heme simultaneously induced other markers of cardiac stress and hypertrophy, including atrial natriuretic factor (Nppa; 14-fold, p <= 0.05) and beta myosin heavy chain (Myh7; 8-fold, p <= 0.05) in SS mice. Our experiments in Nrf2-deficient mice indicate that the cardiac IL-6 response to heme does not require Nrf2, the usual mediator of transcriptional response to heme for heme detoxification by heme oxygenase-1. These data are the first to show heme-induced IL-6 expression in vivo, suggesting that hemolysis may play a role in the elevated IL-6 and cardiac hypertrophy seen in patients and mice with SCD. Our results align with published evidence from rodents and humans without SCD that suggest a causal relationship between IL-6 and cardiac hypertrophy.
37981193	The liver in sickle cell disease.	Liver involvement in SCD patients is frequent but often misdiagnosed or underestimated, except in case of advanced liver diseases. Because of so far poorly recognized forms of chronic SCD-related vascular injury that can silently evolved towards end stages or facilitate ACLF, any persisting liver function tests abnormalities should be carefully investigated, following the above proposed algorithm. Work up and management must be considered multidisciplinary in relationship with a Hepatologist. Early SCD hepatopathy should prompt revision of SCD management to prevent further liver injury and decompensation, discussing transfusion exchanges and hydro urea when not yet initiated, and control for any cofactor of liver injury. The role of HSCT in early SCD hepatopathies also deserves evaluation. In advanced SCD hepatopathies, liver transplantation, which has been rarely performed so far, is the only therapeutic option associated with improved survival. It should definitely be discussed- either electively in case of decompensation in SCD cirrhosis or jaundice/recurrent cholangitis in cholestatic diseases, with excellent outcome, - or emergently in case of ALF or ACLF with more mitigate results. To improve knowledge and management of SCD liver diseases, creation of national and international registries, as well as longitudinal observational cohorts are encouraged.
33348066	Trial design of comparing patient-specific versus weight-based protocols to treat vaso-occlusive episodes in sickle cell disease (COMPARE-VOE).	OBJECTIVES: Painful vaso-occlusive episodes (VOE) are the most common reason for emergency department (ED) visits experienced by patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) evidence-based recommendations for VOE treatment are based primarily on expert opinion. In this randomized controlled trial (RCT), we will compare changes in pain scores between patients randomized to a patient-specific analgesic protocol versus those randomized to a weight-based analgesic protocol, as recommended by the NHLBI guidelines. METHODS: We report the rationale and design of a multi-site, phase III, single-blinded, RCT to be conducted in six EDs in the United States. Eligible participants will be randomized after providing consent, anticipating 50% of those randomized would have an ED visit during the enrollment period. A total of 230 participants with one VOE ED visit provides sufficient power to detect a clinically significant difference in pain score reductions of 14 between groups with 0.05 type I error. Uniquely, this trial randomizes participants in a larger population than the study population, given the impossibility of consenting and randomizing participants during emergencies. The primary endpoint is the change in pain scores in the ED from time of placement in treatment area to time of disposition (hospitalization, discharged home, or assigned to observation status) or a maximum treatment duration of 6 hours. Additional outcomes include hospitalizations and ED visits seven days post enrollment, side effects, and safety assessments. CONCLUSIONS: The COMPARE-VOE study design will provide high-level evidence to support the NHLBI VOE treatment guidelines.
33617594	Characteristics of sickle cell patients with frequent emergency department visits and hospitalizations.	Vaso-occlusive episodes (VOEs) are a hallmark of sickle cell disease (SCD), and account for >90% of health care encounters for this patient population. The Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease, a large study enrolling >3000 patients, showed that the majority of SCD patients (80%) experienced 0-3 major pain crises/year. Only a small minority (~5%) experienced >=6 VOEs/year. Our study sought to further understand this difference in VOE frequency between SCD patients. We analyzed 25 patients (13M/12F, mean age of 28.8) with >=6 ED visits or hospitalizations/year (high utilizers), and compared these with 9 patients (6M/3F, mean age of 37.6) who had <=2 ED visits or hospitalizations/year (low utilizers). All subjects were given a demographic survey along with questionnaires for depression, anxiety, and Health Locus of Control. Each subject then underwent quantitative sensory testing (QST) with three different modalities: pressure pain sensitivity, heat and cold sensitivity, and Von Frey monofilament testing. Laboratory and clinical data were collected through subjects' medical records. CBC and chemistry analysis showed high utilizers had higher WBC (p<0.01), ANC (p<0.01), total bilirubin (p = 0.02), and lower MCV (p = 0.03). Opioid use (morphine equivalents) over the past 6 months was significantly higher in the high utilizer group (12125.7 mg vs 2423.1 mg, p = 0.005). QST results showed lower pressure pain threshold at the ulna (224.4 KPa vs 338.9 KPa, p = 0.04) in the high utilizer group. High utilizers also had higher anxiety (9.0 vs 4.6, p = 0.04) and depression scores (10.0 vs 6.0, p = 0.051). While the low utilizer group had higher education levels with more associate and bachelor degrees (p = 0.009), there was no difference in income or employment. These data show that many biological and psychosocial factors contribute to high health care utilization in SCD. A multi-disciplinary and multi-faceted approach will be required to address this complex problem.

BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a life-limiting inherited hemoglobinopathy that results in significant complications and affects quality of life. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is currently the only curative intervention for SCD; however, guidelines are needed to inform how to apply HSCT in clinical practice. OBJECTIVE: These evidence-based guidelines of the American Society of Hematology (ASH) are intended to support patients, clinicians, and health professionals in their decisions about HSCT for SCD. METHODS: The multidisciplinary guideline panel formed by ASH included 2 patient representatives and was balanced to minimize potential bias from conflicts of interest. The Mayo Evidence-Based Practice Research Program supported the guideline development process, including performing systematic evidence reviews (through 2019). The panel prioritized clinical questions and outcomes according to their importance for clinicians and patients. The panel used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, including GRADE Evidence-to-Decision frameworks, to assess evidence and make recommendations, which were subject to public comment. RESULTS: The panel agreed on 8 recommendations to help patients and providers assess how individuals with SCD should consider the timing and type of HSCT. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence review yielded no randomized controlled clinical trials for HSCT in SCD; therefore, all recommendations are based on very low certainty in the evidence. Key recommendations include considering HSCT for those with neurologic injury or recurrent acute chest syndrome at an early age and to improve nonmyeloablative regimens. Future research should include the development of a robust SCD registry to serve as a comparator for HSCT studies.
38358434	Ovarian tissue cryopreservation for fertility preservation before hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in patients with sickle cell disease: safety, ovarian function follow-up, and results of ovarian tissue transplantation.	PURPOSE: To describe the experience of performing ovarian tissue cryopreservation (OTC) before hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), among girls/women with severe sickle cell disease (SCD)(SS or S/beta0-thalassemia) who are, besides the usual surgical risk, at risk of SCD-related complications during the fertility preservation procedure for improving their counseling and management. METHODS: This retrospective study included 75 patients (girls/women) with SCD who have had OTC before myeloablative conditioning regimen (MAC) for HSCT. Characteristics of patients and data on OTC, ovarian status follow-up, and results of ovarian tissue transplantation (OTT) were collected in medical records. RESULTS: At OTC, the median (IQR 25-75; range) age of the patients was 9.6 (6.9-14.1; 3.6-28.3) years, 56/75 were prepubertal, and no SCD or surgery-related complications occurred. The median follow-up post-HSCT was > 9 years. At the last follow-up, among prepubertal patients at HSCT, 26/56 were >= 15 years old and presented with a premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), except 2, including the patient who had received an OTT to induce puberty. Eight were 13-15 years old and presented for POI. The remaining 22 patients were under 13. Among the 19 patients who were menarche at HSCT, 2 died 6 months post-HSCT and we do not have ovarian function follow-up for the other 2 patients. All the remaining patients (n = 15) had POI. Five patients had OTT. All had a return of ovarian function. One patient gave birth to a healthy baby. CONCLUSION: OTC is a safe fertility preservation technique and could be offered before MAC independent of the patient's age.
38517255	Effect of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation on sickle cell disease-related organ complications: A systematic review and meta-analysis.	Sickle cell disease (SCD)-related organ complications are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with SCD. We sought to assess whether hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) stabilizes, attenuates, or exacerbates organ decline. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of trials investigating organ function before and after HSCT in patients with SCD. We searched MEDLINE/PubMed and EMBASE up to September 21, 2023. Continuous data were expressed as standardized mean difference (SMD) and pooled in a weighted inverse-variance random-effects model; binomial data were expressed as risk ratio (RR) using the Mantel-Haenszel random-effects meta-analyses. Of 823 screened studies, 34 were included in this review. Of these, 17 (774 patients, 23.6% adults, 86.3% HLA-identical sibling donor, 56.7% myeloablative conditioning regimen) were included in the meta-analyses. Pulmonary function remained stable. Mean tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity decreased but did not reach statistical significance. In children, estimated glomerular filtration rate decreased (SMD -0.80, p = .01), and the presence of proteinuria increased (RR 2.00, p = <.01), while splenic uptake and phagocytic function improved (RR 0.31, p = <.01; RR 0.23, p = <.01). Cerebral blood flow improved (SMD -1.39, p = <.01), and a low incidence of stroke after transplantation in high-risk patients was found. Retinopathy and avascular osteonecrosis were investigated in only one study, showing no significant changes. While HSCT can improve some SCD-related organ dysfunctions, transplantation-related toxicity may have an adverse effect on others. Future research should focus on identifying individuals with SCD who might benefit most from HSCT and which forms of organ damage are more likely to exacerbate post-transplantation.
37045941	Haploidentical allogeneic stem cell transplantation with post-transplant cyclophosphamide and subsequent kidney transplant for patients with severe sickle cell disease with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD).	
33658643	Correction of murine sickle cell disease by allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation with anti-3rd party veto cells.	Despite advances in gene therapy allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCT) remains the most effective way to cure sickle cell disease (SCD). However, there are substantial challenges including lack of suitable donors, therapy-related toxicity (TRM) and risk of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). Perhaps the most critical question is when to do a transplant for SCD. Safer transplant protocols for HLA-disparate HSCT is needed before transplants are widely accepted for SCD. Although risk of GvHD and TRM are less with T-cell-deplete HSCT and reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC), transplant rejection is a challenge. We have reported graft rejection of T cell-depleted non-myeloablative HSCT can be overcome in wild type fully mis-matched recipient mice, using donor-derived anti-3rd party central memory CD8-positive veto cells combined with short-term low-dose rapamycin. Here, we report safety and efficacy of this approach in a murine model for SCD. Durable donor-derived chimerism was achieved using this strategy with reversal of pathological parameters of SCD, including complete conversion to normal donor-derived red cells, and correction of splenomegaly and the levels of circulating reticulocytes, hematocrit, and hemoglobin.
34565708	Combination Therapy With Bortezomib in Renal Medullary Carcinoma: A Case Series.	BACKGROUND: Renal medullary carcinoma (RMC) is a very rare, aggressive neoplasm occurring almost exclusively in adolescents and young adults with sickle cell trait. Given the rare nature of this tumor, accounting for less than 0.5% of all renal carcinomas, most of the published data on therapies is from case reports and small case series, and current treatments are insufficient, with most patients succumbing to their disease in months. We report our experience with a cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen consisting of platinum-based therapy, doxorubicin, and bortezomib. METHODS: Three patients with metastatic RMC at a single institution were treated off-label with a perioperative chemotherapy regimen for 4 cycles of 2 alternating regimens: regimen A consisting of cisplatin, doxorubicin, and bortezomib; regimen B consisting of carboplatin, paclitaxel, and gemcitabine. A radical nephrectomy was performed on all patients. Surveillance imaging was performed on all patients to assess response and disease burden. Patients received up to 12 months of maintenance therapy with everolimus. RESULTS: Three African American patients - 2 males and 1 female aged 14, 28, and 31 - with sickle cell trait and metastatic disease were treated with this regimen. The median follow-up was 18 months. All had resection of the primary tumor - 2 patients after receiving neoadjuvant therapy, and one patient underwent resection prior to referral. All 3 patients achieved complete responses based on imaging, 2 of which lasted for 12 months, and another is still in remission over 7 years after diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: This regimen of alternating cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy with bortezomib appeared to be active against RMC and was generally well-tolerated. Given the extremely rare nature of this disease and dismal prognosis, new treatment modalities should be pursued, and whenever possible, patients should be enrolled in a clinical trial. We propose that a multiinstitution clinical trial of this regiment may be warranted.
32681817	FcgammaR2B B2.4 haplotype predicts increased risk of red blood cell alloimmunization in sickle cell disease patients.	BACKGROUND: Red blood cell (RBC) alloimmunization is an important transfusion complication which is prevalent among sickle cell disease (SCD) patients. Autoimmune diseases are a known risk factor for RBC alloimmunization, suggesting that autoimmunity and post-transfusion alloantibody development occur through similar physiopathological pathways. Polymorphisms in the FcgammaR2B gene have already been associated with several autoimmune disorders and hypothetically could be associated with RBC alloimmunization. Our goal was to evaluate if important polymorphisms of FcgammaR2B have an impact on the risk of RBC alloimmunization among SCD patients. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a case-control study in which alloimmunized and non-alloimmunized SCD patients were compared in terms of the genotype frequency of the FcgammaR2B polymorphisms -386G/C, -120 T/A, and 695C/T, genotyped through direct Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: A total of 237 patients met the eligibility criteria, 120 cases (alloimmunized) and 117 controls (non-alloimmunized). RBC alloimmunization was associated with female sex (p < 0.001), lifetime number of RBC units transfused (p = 0.002) and 120 T/A FcgammaR2B genotype (p = 0.031). The FcgammaR2B promoter region haplotype 2B.4 (386C120A) was positively associated with RBC alloimunization (p = 0.045). The logistic regression (LR) model identified female sex (OR 10.03, CI 95% 5.16-19.49; p < 0.001) and FcgammaR2B 2B.4 haplotype (OR 4.55, CI95% 1.1118.65; p = 0.035) as independent predictors of RBC alloimmunization in SCD patients. CONCLUSION: SCD patients with the FcgammaR2B 2B.4 haplotype had over a fourfold higher risk for RBC alloimmunization. This highlights the role played by FcgammaR2B on RBC alloimmunization and may be helpful in identifying the immune responders.
32691114	Manual erythroexchange in sickle cell disease: multicenter validation of a protocol predictive of volume to exchange and hemoglobin values.	Manual erythroexchange (MEEX) was proven to be effective and safe in the management of sickle cell disease (SCD). The goal is to quickly reduce the percentage of hemoglobin S (HbS%). A national survey of the Italian Society for Thalassemia and Hemoglobinopathies (SITE) observed a great variability among MEEX protocols none of which were found to be predictive of the values of HbS% and hemoglobin (Hb) after the exchange. Two equations to estimate the HbS% and Hb values to be obtained after MEEX were developed based on the results of the MEEX procedures in place in the centers participating in the present study. A standard protocol was subsequently defined to evaluate the volumes to exchange to obtain the target values of HbS% and Hb. The protocol was tested in 261 MEEX performed in SCD patients followed in the 5 participating centers that belong to the Italian Hemoglobinopathy Comprehensive Care Network, with the support of the SITE. The results showed a correlation between the estimated and measured values of HbS% and Hb (Rp 0.95 and 0.65 respectively, p < 0.001). A negligible bias was found for the prediction of HbS% and a bias of 1 g/dl for Hb. From consecutive MEEX, a rate of increase of HbS% between two exchanges of around 0.4% per day (p < 0.001) was measured. This protocol was shown to be effective and safe, as all patients reached the target value of HbS%. All the MEEX procedures were carried out with single venous access. No adverse events or reactions such as hypotension or electrolyte imbalance were reported nor were any complaints concerning the procedures received from patients.
31836598	Acute Kidney Injury and CKD Associated with Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation.	Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is a life-saving therapy for many patients with cancer, as well as patients with some nonmalignant hematologic disorders, such as aplastic anemia, sickle cell disease, and certain congenital immune deficiencies. Kidney injury directly associated with stem cell transplantation includes a wide range of structural and functional abnormalities, which may be vascular (hypertension, thrombotic microangiopathy), glomerular (albuminuria, nephrotic glomerulopathies), and/or tubulointerstitial. AKI occurs commonly after stem cell transplant, affecting 10%-73% of patients. The cause is often multifactorial and can include sepsis, nephrotoxic medications, marrow infusion syndrome, hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, thrombotic microangiopathy, infections, and graft versus host disease. The risk of post-transplant kidney injury varies depending on patient characteristics, type of transplant (allogeneic versus autologous), and choice of chemotherapeutic conditioning regimen (myeloablative versus nonmyeloablative). Importantly, AKI is associated with substantial morbidity, including the need for KRT in approximately 5% of patients and the development of CKD in up to 60% of transplant recipients. AKI has been associated universally with higher all-cause and nonrelapse mortality regardless of transplant type, and studies have consistently shown extremely high (>80%) mortality rates in those patients requiring acute dialysis. Accordingly, prevention, early recognition, and prompt treatment of kidney injury are essential to improving kidney and patient outcomes after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and for realizing the full potential of this therapy.
35993188	Severe cases of COVID-19 in children with sickle cell disease during the Omicron wave in France: a plea for vaccination.	
37555364	Response to "Efficacy of COVID-19 vaccination in adult patients with sickle cell disease: Comment".	
38296295	Protocol for an evaluation of the initiation of an integrated longitudinal outpatient care model for severe chronic non-communicable diseases (PEN-Plus) at secondary care facilities (district hospitals) in 10 lower-income countries.	INTRODUCTION: The Package of Essential Noncommunicable Disease Interventions-Plus (PEN-Plus) is a strategy decentralising care for severe non-communicable diseases (NCDs) including type 1 diabetes, rheumatic heart disease and sickle cell disease, to increase access to care. In the PEN-Plus model, mid-level clinicians in intermediary facilities in low and lower middle income countries are trained to provide integrated care for conditions where services traditionally were only available at tertiary referral facilities. For the upcoming phase of activities, 18 first-level hospitals in 9 countries and 1 state in India were selected for PEN-Plus expansion and will treat a variety of severe NCDs. Over 3 years, the countries and state are expected to: (1) establish PEN-Plus clinics in one or two district hospitals, (2) support these clinics to mature into training sites in preparation for national or state-level scale-up, and (3) work with the national or state-level stakeholders to describe, measure and advocate for PEN-Plus to support development of a national operational plan for scale-up. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Guided by Proctor outcomes for implementation research, we are conducting a mixed-method evaluation consisting of 10 components to understand outcomes in clinical implementation, training and policy development. Data will be collected through a mix of quantitative surveys, routine reporting, routine clinical data and qualitative interviews. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This protocol has been considered exempt or covered by central and local institutional review boards. Findings will be disseminated throughout the project's course, including through quarterly M&E discussions, semiannual formative assessments, dashboard mapping of progress, quarterly newsletters, regular feedback loops with national stakeholders and publication in peer-reviewed journals.
33661168	Is Busulfan Clearance Different in Patients With Sickle Cell Disease? Let's Clear Up That Case With Some Controls.	In busulfan-based conditioning regimen for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in children, accurate a priori determination of the first dose is important because of its narrow therapeutic window. Sickle cell disease (SCD) influences pharmacokinetics of the commonly used drugs by affecting organs responsible for drug metabolism and elimination. This pharmacokinetics study assesses the influence of SCD on the metabolic pathway of busulfan that is mainly metabolized in the liver. In this retrospective cross-sectional case-control study, 16 patients with SCD were matched to 50 patients without SCD on known busulfan clearance's covariates (glutathione-S-transferase alpha1 polymorphisms, age, weight). Clearance of the first dose of busulfan was not significantly different independently of genetic or anthropometric factors in patients with or without SCD.
32043441	Fever Management in Sickle Cell Disease in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: A Survey of SCD Management Programs.	Management of fever is a key element of care for children with sickle cell disease (SCD). There exist few studies of current practices in managing fevers in SCD in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and malaria-endemic regions where SCD is prevalent. We surveyed medical providers in these settings to characterize current practices in infection prevention and fever management for children with SCD. We found wide variation in use of newborn screening for early diagnosis and infection prevention, pneumococcal vaccination, use of antibiotics and antimalarials, and route of antibiotic administration. Counter to established guidelines, 78% (95% CI: 59-100%) of respondents would consider using oral antibiotics for a febrile child with SCD. Only 17% (95% CI: 0-37%) would administer antibiotics to a well-appearing child with a positive malaria test. Availability of blood cultures did not affect duration of antibiotic course. Further study and standardization of fever management in SCD in LMICs are urgently needed.
32134130	The value of transfusion of phenotyped blood units for thalassemia and sickle cell anemia patients at an academic center.	BACKGROUND: Blood transfusion is the first-line treatment for patients with thalassemia and many sickle cell patients. However, cases of unregulated blood transfusion are shown to carry a high risk of alloimmunization to red blood cells (RBCs), which can lead to a hemolytic transfusion reaction and be fatal to patients. Screening and identification of alloantibodies are, therefore, essential practice in blood transfusion services. Transfusion of phenotyped blood can minimize these risks to patients. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A prospective study was carried out on 1015 donors, and a prospective and retrospective study was carried out on 208 multiple transfused patients with beta-thalassemia and sickle cell anemia. Donor and patient samples were subjected to Rh & K typing, and patient samples were also subjected to screening & identification of RBC antibodies. We aimed to determine the prevalence of RBC antigens in thalassemia and sickle cell patients, as well as blood donors, at King Abdulaziz University Hospital and the frequency of alloimmunization in the selected patients. RESULTS: The most commonly detected Rh-phenotype in donors was R1r (32.02%), followed by R1R1 (23.25%). Only 9.16% of donors were positive for the K antigen. The prevalence of Rh and K blood group antigens was also reported: the highest detected Rh-phenotype was R1r (40.86%) followed by R1R2 (24.04%) with only (6.25%) positive patients for K antigen. The rate of alloimmunization among sickle cell anemia and thalassemia patients was 39.42% and 35.57%, respectively. The highest specificity rates of the alloantibodies were recorded for anti-E and anti-K in both patient groups. CONCLUSION: The rate of alloimmunization in transfused patients was high and particularly observed against the Rh and K antigens. This study emphasizes the clinical need for typing patient RBCs prior to transfusion so as to provide phenotyped matched blood units and minimize the risks and associated morbidities of alloimmunization. Keeping a database of phenotyped blood donors is essential for the clinically effective and safe management of transfusion patients.
38742616	Pain: The Silent Public Health Epidemic.	More than 50 million Americans suffer from chronic pain, costing our society an estimated 565 to 635 billion dollars annually. Its complexity and training deficits in healthcare providers result in many patients receiving ineffective care. Large health inequities also exist in access to effective pain care for vulnerable populations. The traumatic history of indigenous people and people of color in regards to the experience of pain care perpetuates a lack of trust in the healthcare system, causing many to hesitate to seek medical treatment for painful events and conditions. Other vulnerable populations include those with sickle cell disease or fibromyalgia, whose experience of pain has not been well-understood. There are both barriers to care and stigma for patients with pain, including those taking prescribed doses of long-term opioids, those with known substance use disorder, and those with mental health diagnoses. The suffering of patients with pain can be "invisible" to the clinician, and to one's community at large. Pain can affect all people; but those most vulnerable to not getting effective care may continue to suffer in silence because their voices are not heard. Since 1973, pain societies around the globe have worked tirelessly to bring clinicians together to advance pain and opioid education, research, and patient care. These improvements consist of pain education, integrative treatment, and the understanding that a therapeutic alliance is critical to effective pain management. Pain education for both pre and post-licensure health professionals has increased substantially over the last decade. In addition, integrative and interdisciplinary approaches for clinical pain management are now considered best practices in pain care for patients with moderate to severe pain in addition to the development of a strong therapeutic alliance.
34958973	Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor Is Safe and Well Tolerated following Allogeneic Transplantation in Patients with Sickle Cell Disease.	Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) used after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can enhance neutrophil recovery in patients rendered neutropenic by the preparative regimen. G-CSF is contraindicated in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), because life-threatening complications can ensue in the presence of sickle vasculopathy. The safety profile of G-CSF after HSCT for SCD has not been described, however. We report clinical outcomes in the first 100 days post-HSCT in 62 patients supported with G-CSF until neutrophil recovery on a clinical trial of reduced- intensity conditioning HSCT for SCD. The patients received G-CSF for a median of 9 days (range, 5 to 33 days) post-transplantation from the best available stem cell source. Preparation for transplantation included a target hemoglobin S level of <=45%. Neutrophil engraftment (absolute neutrophil count >0.5 x 103/mL) was achieved at a median of 13 days (range, 10 to 34 days), and platelet engraftment (>50 x 103/mL) was achieved at a median of 19 days (range, 12 to 71 days). The median duration of inpatient hospitalization following stem cell infusion (day 0) was 21.5 days (range, 11 to 33 days). No patient developed SCD-related complications following G-CSF use. The most common organ toxicities encountered between G-CSF initiation (on day +7) and day +100 were anorexia (n = 14), hypertension (n = 11), and electrolyte imbalance requiring correction (n = 9). Central nervous system-related events were noted in 5 patients, all of whom had preexisting cerebral vasculopathy/moyamoya disease, attributed to reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome in the presence of calcineurin inhibitor therapy and hypertension. We conclude that G-CSF does not adversely impact SCD HSCT recipients and can be safely used post-transplantation to enhance neutrophil recovery.
38359264	Hematopoietic stem cell collection for sickle cell disease gene therapy.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Gene therapy for sickle cell disease (SCD) is advancing rapidly, with two transformative products recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and numerous others under study. All current gene therapy protocols require ex vivo modification of autologous hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). However, several SCD-related problems impair HSC collection, including a stressed and damaged bone marrow, potential cytotoxicity by the major therapeutic drug hydroxyurea, and inability to use granulocyte colony stimulating factor, which can precipitate severe vaso-occlusive events. RECENT FINDINGS: Peripheral blood mobilization of HSCs using the CXCR4 antagonist plerixafor followed by apheresis collection was recently shown to be safe and effective for most SCD patients and is the current strategy for mobilizing HSCs. However, exceptionally large numbers of HSCs are required to manufacture an adequate cellular product, responses to plerixafor are variable, and most patients require multiple mobilization cycles, increasing the risk for adverse events. For some, gene therapy is prohibited by the failure to obtain adequate numbers of HSCs. SUMMARY: Here we review the current knowledge on HSC collection from individuals with SCD and potential improvements that may enhance the safety, efficacy, and availability of gene therapy for this disorder.
34982335	Health Care Providers Perceptions About Preconception Care in Ibadan, Southwest Nigeria: A Qualitative Study.	OBJECTIVES: Preconception care (PCC) is a recognised strategy for optimising maternal health and improving maternal and neonatal outcomes. PCC services are minimally available and not fully integrated into maternal health services in Nigeria. This study explored perceptions about PCC services among health care providers in Ibadan, Nigeria. METHODS: Using a qualitative case study design the perspectives of 26 health care providers-16 specialist physicians and nine nurses covering 10 specialties at the primary, secondary and tertiary health care levels was explored. In-depth interviews were digitally recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed on MAXQDA using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Almost all participants stated that PCC services should be offered at all three levels of health care with referral when needed between lower and higher levels. Participants stated that although all people of reproductive age would benefit from PCC, those who had medical problems like hypertension, sickle cell disease, diabetes and infertility would benefit more. Participants opined that delayed health care seeking observed in the community may influence acceptability of PCC especially for people without known pre-existing conditions. All specialist physicians identified the relevance of PCC to their practice. They identified potential benefits of PCC including opportunity to prepare for pregnancy to ensure positive pregnancy outcomes. CONCLUSIONS FOR PRACTICE: Preconception care is perceived as important for promoting positive pregnancy outcomes in people with known medical problems and is relevant to different specialities of medical practice. Provision of the service will require establishment of guidelines and uptake will depend on acceptability to community members who will benefit from the service.
31808864	Complications in pregnant women with sickle cell disease.	Pregnancy in women with sickle cell disease (SCD) is associated with increased maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Outcomes vary widely owing to methodological limitations of clinical studies, but overall, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, venothromboembolism, poor fetal growth, and maternal and perinatal mortality are increased globally. Few therapeutic interventions have been explored other than prophylactic and selective transfusion therapy. Unfortunately, existing data are limited, and it remains unclear whether prophylactic use of chronic transfusions will improve pregnancy outcomes. Management of pregnant women with SCD is best accomplished with a multidisciplinary team that includes a sickle cell expert and an obstetrician familiar with high-risk pregnancies. Women with SCD should have individualized care plans that outline management of acute pain and guidelines for transfusion therapy. Neonates require close monitoring for neonatal abstinence syndrome and hemolytic disease of the newborn. Ideally all young women with SCD will have a "reproductive life plan" developed as a component of preconception counseling and health promotion. Research leading to improved pregnancy management focused on diminishing adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes is overdue. International collaborations should be considered to improve subject recruitment and foster timely completion of clinical trials. Additional therapeutic interventions outside of transfusion therapy should be explored.
33741487	Impact of COVID-19 on vasooclusive crisis in patients with sickle cell anaemia.	OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to assess COVID-19 impact on the morbidity and mortality of vasooclusive crisis (VOC) in sickle cell anaemia (SCA) patients. METHODS: A prospective cohort study of 100 SCA patients; 50 with COVID-19 (COVID group) and 50 without (non-COVID group). All patients signed written informed consent. RESULTS: The COVID group had a significantly higher VOC episode median per year; 3 (IQR,1-6) vs 2 (IQR,2-12) (P < 0.05). The need for hospitalisation was similar in both groups. The non-COVID group had more history of culture-proven infection (P = 0.05). The COVID-group had more osteonecrosis (P < 0.05), splenic sequestration, splenomegaly and hepatic crisis (P = 0.05, 0.006, 0.02; respectively) and significantly higher (P < 0.05) symptoms of fever, cough, fatigue, abdominal pain and anosmia. Mean haemoglobin, lymphocyte subset, platelets, and reticulocytes were reduced in both groups, while lactate dehydrogenase and ferritin levels were significantly elevated. In the COVID group, the rise in white blood cell count, reticulocyte percentage, platelets and ferritin was subdued (P < 0.05). Two patients in the COVID group and 3 in the non-COVID group died; there was no statistically significant difference in mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Although COVID-19 may have triggered the onset of VOC, it did not significantly influence VOC-related morbidity or mortality in this SCA cohort.
32138685	Renal medullary carcinoma masquerading as renal infection: a case report.	BACKGROUND: Renal medullary carcinoma is a rare and aggressive tumor and often seen in young adults with sickle cell hemoglobinopathies. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of renal medullary carcinoma in a 29-year old male patient with an occupying renal lesion who presented with fever, flank pain and hematuria. The patient received intensive antibiotics treatment, but no improvement was seen. The symptoms disappeared after laparoscopic radical left nephrectomy. Postoperative pathological study showed that the mass was renal medullary carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: Our case suggests that renal medullary carcinoma should be considered in differential diagnoses of patients with occupying renal lesions who have fever of unknown origin.
31742673	Pharmacological interventions for painful sickle cell vaso-occlusive crises in adults.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of inherited disorders of haemoglobin (Hb) structure in a person who has inherited two mutant globin genes (one from each parent), at least one of which is always the sickle mutation. It is estimated that between 5% and 7% of the world's population are carriers of the mutant Hb gene, and SCD is the most commonly inherited blood disorder. SCD is characterized by distorted sickle-shaped red blood cells. Manifestations of the disease are attributed to either haemolysis (premature red cell destruction) or vaso-occlusion (obstruction of blood flow, the most common manifestation). Shortened lifespans are attributable to serious comorbidities associated with the disease, including renal failure, acute cholecystitis, pulmonary hypertension, aplastic crisis, pulmonary embolus, stroke, acute chest syndrome, and sepsis. Vaso-occlusion can lead to an acute, painful crisis (sickle cell crisis, vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) or vaso-occlusive episode). Pain is most often reported in the joints, extremities, back or chest, but it can occur anywhere and can last for several days or weeks. The bone and muscle pain experienced during a sickle cell crisis is both acute and recurrent. Key pharmacological treatments for VOC include opioid analgesics, non-opioid analgesics, and combinations of drugs. Non-pharmacological approaches, such as relaxation, hypnosis, heat, ice and acupuncture, have been used in conjunction to rehydrating the patient and reduce the sickling process. OBJECTIVES: To assess the analgesic efficacy and adverse events of pharmacological interventions to treat acute painful sickle cell vaso-occlusive crises in adults, in any setting. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) via the Cochrane Register of Studies Online, MEDLINE via Ovid, Embase via Ovid and LILACS, from inception to September 2019. We also searched the reference lists of retrieved studies and reviews, and searched online clinical trial registries. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized, controlled, double-blind trials of pharmacological interventions, of any dose and by any route, compared to placebo or any active comparator, for the treatment (not prevention) of painful sickle cell VOC in adults. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Three review authors independently assessed studies for eligibility. We planned to use dichotomous data to calculate risk ratio (RR) and number needed to treat for one additional event, using standard methods. Our primary outcomes were participant-reported pain relief of 50%, or 30%, or greater; Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) very much improved, or much or very much improved. Our secondary outcomes included adverse events, serious adverse events, and withdrawals due to adverse events. We assessed GRADE and created three 'Summary of findings' tables. MAIN RESULTS: We included nine studies with data for 638 VOC events and 594 participants aged 17 to 42 years with SCD presenting to a hospital emergency department in a painful VOC. Three studies investigated a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) compared to placebo. One study compared an opioid with a placebo, two studies compared an opioid with an active comparator, two studies compared an anticoagulant with a placebo, and one study compared a combination of three drugs with a combination of four drugs. Risk of bias across the nine studies varied. Studies were primarily at an unclear risk of selection, performance, and detection bias. Studies were primarily at a high risk of bias for size with fewer than 50 participants per treatment arm; two studies had 50 to 199 participants per treatment arm (unclear risk). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) compared with placebo No data were reported regarding participant-reported pain relief of 50% or 30% or greater. The efficacy was uncertain regarding PGIC very much improved, and PGIC much or very much improved (no difference; 1 study, 21 participants; very low-quality evidence). Very low-quality, uncertain results suggested similar rates of adverse events across both the NSAIDs group (16/45 adverse events, 1/56 serious adverse events, and 1/56 withdrawal due to adverse events) and the placebo group (19/45 adverse events, 2/56 serious adverse events, and 1/56 withdrawal due to adverse events). Opioids compared with placebo No data were reported regarding participant-reported pain relief of 50% or 30%, PGIC, or adverse events (any adverse event, serious adverse events, and withdrawals due to adverse events). Opioids compared with active comparator No data were reported regarding participant-reported pain relief of 50% or 30% or greater. The results were uncertain regarding PGIC very much improved (33% of the opioids group versus 19% of the placebo group). No data were reported regarding PGIC much or very much improved. Very low-quality, uncertain results suggested similar rates of adverse events across both the opioids group (9/66 adverse events, and 0/66 serious adverse events) and the placebo group (7/64 adverse events, 0/66 serious adverse events). No data were reported regarding withdrawal due to adverse events. Quality of the evidence We downgraded the quality of the evidence by three levels to very low-quality because there are too few data to have confidence in results (e.g. too few participants per treatment arm). Where no data were reported for an outcome, we had no evidence to support or refute (quality of the evidence is unknown). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This review identified only nine studies, with insufficient data for all pharmacological interventions for analysis. The available evidence is very uncertain regarding the efficacy or harm from pharmacological interventions used to treat pain related to sickle cell VOC in adults. This area could benefit most from more high quality, certain evidence, as well as the establishment of suitable registries which record interventions and outcomes for this group of people.

38380832	Donors with repeated blood product discards for filtration problems, clots or hemolysis: Causes and follow-up.	INTRODUCTION: Sanquin donor medicine department is informed when donations or their components are rejected. This can occur isolated or frequently. It is undesirable because the donations cannot be used and there may be an underlying medical cause. Based on regional approaches, a uniform procedure was developed. METHODS: Information about whole blood, plasma- plateletpheresis donations from which one or more components were rejected for filtration time (>2 h), hemolysis or clots were extracted from blood bank information system. After rejection of two successive components or donations or total >=3 the donor is contacted. Depending on the medical history and investigation by the family doctor, the donor carrier is re-evaluated. We looked for the causes of the discarded products and performed a survey among blood services regarding polices with discarded products. RESULTS: One or more components from 1742 of about 2.2 million successful donations (0.08%) were rejected. The highest percentage of rejection was seen in plateletpheresis (1.5%), all for clots. No underlying medical causes were found. 24 whole blood donors were found to have sickle cell trait (SCT) and were permanently deferred. The policies for follow-up after discarded products or acceptance of SCT donors vary between the 16 blood banks. Six organizations do not follow-up donors and seven accept SCT for blood or plasma donation. CONCLUSION: Informing donors with repeated discarded products avoids the non-use of donations. Causes of repeated discarded products can be found by follow-up of donors. The results of the survey indicate a large discrepancy in policies applied worldwide.

34555941	Health-Related Stigma, Social Support, Self-Efficacy, and Self-Care Actions Among Adults With Sickle Cell Disease in Oman.	Stigma contributes to the burden of individuals and families affected by Sickle cell disease (SCD) and causes delay in appropriate care seeking. The aim of this study is to examine the levels and associations between stigma, social support, self-efficacy, and self-care actions among adult patients with SCD in Oman using a cross-sectional, correlational design. Of the 264 participants, 56.1% (n = 148) were males, with mean age of 30.1 years (SD 7.7). Half of the participants were married, and 88.3% had no other associated diseases. The results demonstrate that patients in Oman suffer from health-related stigma. However, social support, self-efficacy, and self-care actions were reported to be high and correlated with several clinical and demographic variables. Based on the results, effective, low-cost interventions such as psycho-educational groups, individual counseling, or group therapies might be developed. They can promote belief in enhanced efficacy and improved SCD adaptation, thereby increasing patient, and provider satisfaction.
33742546	The comfort ability program for adolescents with sickle cell pain: Evaluating feasibility and acceptability of an inpatient group-based clinical implementation.	BACKGROUND: Integration of nonpharmacological therapies, such as cognitive and behavioral pain management strategies, is recommended to support comprehensive disease and pain management among children and adolescents with sickle cell disease (SCD). The Comfort Ability Program for Sickle Cell Pain (CAP for SCP) introduces psychological and biobehavioral pain management strategies to children and adolescents with SCD. This study aimed to pilot the implementation of the CAP for SCP in a group setting to children and adolescents hospitalized for SCD pain examining feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness on improving pain knowledge and coping efficacy. METHOD: Adaptation of CAP for SCP into a three-session group format was guided by four phases of the Dynamic Adaptation Process model: Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, and Sustainment. Youth with SCD (n = 57) hospitalized for pain participated in at least one session and completed self-report of knowledge of pain management skills, pain coping efficacy, and treatment acceptance. Completion rates of sessions and qualitative feedback were gathered to evaluate feasibility and acceptability. RESULTS: Feasibility of conducting inpatient group sessions was suboptimal; however, patients and medical providers reported moderate to high levels of treatment acceptance. Patients also reported significant improvements in knowledge of pain management skills following session 1. CONCLUSIONS: CAP for SCP is a patient-centered first-line psychoeducational intervention that can be integrated into clinical practice settings to introduce youth to cognitive and behavioral pain management strategies to support SCD pain management.
32205585	Current and future gene therapies for hemoglobinopathies.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In this work we briefly summarize the key features and currently available conventional therapies for the two main beta-hemoglobinopathies, sickle cell disease (SCD) and beta-thalassemia, and review the rapidly evolving field of novel and emerging genetic therapies to cure the disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Gene therapy using viral vectors or designer nuclease-based gene editing is a relatively new field of medicine that uses the patient's own genetically modified cells to treat his or her own disease. Multiple different approaches are currently in development, and some have entered phase I clinical studies, including innovative therapies aiming at induction of fetal hemoglobin. SUMMARY: Early short-term therapeutic benefit has been reported for some of the ongoing clinical trials, but confirmation of long-term safety and efficacy remains to be shown. Future therapies aiming at the targeted correction of specific disease-causing DNA mutations are emerging and will likely enter clinical testing in the near future.
33470527	Pretransplant myeloid and immune suppression, reduced toxicity conditioning with posttransplant cyclophosphamide: Initial outcomes of novel approach for matched unrelated donor hematopoietic stem cell transplant for hemoglobinopathies.	Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is currently the only curative option for thalassemia major (TM) and sickle cell disease (SCD). We report our experience of using pretransplant immune suppression (PTIS), augmented Johns Hopkins conditioning, and posttransplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) as graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis for matched unrelated donor (MUD) transplant in TM/SCD. At a median follow-up of 307.5 days (range 251-395), all patients (three TM, one SCD) are alive and disease free. MUD HSCT with PTIS, augmented Johns Hopkins conditioning, and PTCy as GvHD prophylaxis is a promising way of treating patients with hemoglobinopathies with low regimen-related toxicity (RRT), no risk of graft failure (GF) and minimal GvHD rates.
34550539	Red blood cell exchange in children with sickle cell disease.	The aim of our study was to assess the efficacy of red blood cell exchange (RBCx) using a Spectra Optia  automated apheresis system in children with sickle cell disease (SCD). We used automated RBCx to treat acute and chronic complications in 75 children with SCD who had a median age of 10 years [7-13]. We analyzed 649 RBCx sessions. Peripheral venous access was limited in a number of the children, and thus a femoral double-lumen central venous catheter was required. We recommend heparin locking with 500 units in each lumen of the catheter. To prevent complications, we ensured that all patients had achieved a post-RCE HbS level of < 30%. For chronic transfusion, with a post-RCE Hb level of approximately 10-11 g/dL, a blood exchange volume of >= 32 mL/kg, and an interval between each RBCx procedure of <= 30 days, the residual HbS level was maintained below 30%. For acute transfusion, a post-exchange Hb level >= 10 g/dL (p < 0.001) and a total exchange volume >= 35 mL/kg (p = 0.001) were the best way to reduce HbS to < 30%. AUC was 0.84. Our results show that erythrocytapheresis was useful and safe for children with SCD.
35691534	Distribution of Emergency Department Encounters and Subsequent Hospital Admissions for Children by Child Opportunity Index.	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate differences in emergency department (ED) utilization and subsequent admission among children by Child Opportunity Index (COI). METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study of pediatric (<18 years) encounters to 194 EDs in Illinois from 2016 to 2020. Each encounter was assigned to quntiles of COI 2.0 by postal code. We described the difference in the percent of encounters between lower (Very Low and Low) and higher (Very High and High) COI overall and among diagnoses with overrepresentation from lower COI groups. We evaluated the association of diagnosis with COI in ordinal models adjusted for demographics. RESULTS: There were 4,653,026 eligible ED encounters classified by COI as Very Low (28.6%), Low (24.8%), Moderate (20.3%), High (15.6%), and Very High (10.8%) (difference between low and high COI encounters 27.0%). Diagnoses with the greatest difference between low and high COI were eye infection, upper respiratory tract infections, and cough. The COI distribution for children admitted from the ED (n = 140,298) was 29.1% Very Low, 19.3% Low, 18.2% Moderate, 17.7% High, and 15.7% Very High (percent difference 15.1%). Diagnoses with the greatest differences between low and high COI among admitted patients were sickle cell crisis, asthma, and influenza. All ED diagnoses and 7/12 admission diagnoses were associated with lower COI in multivariable ordinal models. CONCLUSIONS: Children from lower COI areas are overrepresented in ED and inpatient encounters overall and within certain diagnosis groups. Further research is required to examine how health outcomes may be influenced by the structural and contextual characteristics of a child's neighborhood.
34119338	Women with sickle cell disease report low knowledge and use of long acting reversible contraception.	BACKGROUND: High rates of unplanned pregnancy and low rates of contraception use are reported among women with sickle cell disease (SCD). Pregnancy in women with SCD is high risk and unintended pregnancies limit opportunities to provide indicated preconception care and counseling. Contraceptive use in women with SCD is complicated by a lack of disease-specific data about treatment risks and benefits. The purpose of this study was to describe, for the first time in the U.S. context, contraceptive use, knowledge and preferences in adult cohort of women with SCD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A single-center survey study of women with SCD of reproductive age from our Center's adult and pediatric sickle cell centers. RESULTS: Seventy-eight women ages 28-65 years (median 33.5 years, IQR 16) completed surveys. Seventy-three percent of respondents had an average of 2.5 pregnancies (S.D. 1.22) and of these, 58% reported being pregnant when they did not want to be pregnant at least once. The most common forms of contraception used were condoms (87%), birth control pills (46%), medroxyprogesterone (44%) and withdrawal (44%). Twenty-two percent of subjects reported using a long-acting reversible form of contraception and 21% reported a tubal ligation or partner vasectomy. Respondents demonstrated low knowledge of the efficacy of contraceptive options and over-estimated the risk of pregnancy with the IUD, implant. Contraceptive priorities included pregnancy prevention, decreasing HIV transmission and effects on SCD symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Women with SCD have high rates of unintended pregnancy, low knowledge of contraceptive efficacy and low use of long-acting reversible contraception.
38262104	Effect of voxelotor on murine bone marrow and peripheral blood with hematopoietic progenitor cell mobilization for gene therapy of sickle cell disease.	In preparation for hematopoietic stem cell mobilization and collection, current ex vivo gene therapy protocols for sickle cell disease require patients to undergo several months of chronic red cell transfusion. For health care equity, alternatives to red cell transfusion should be available. We examined whether treatment with GBT1118, the murine analog of voxelotor, could be a safe and feasible alternative to red cell transfusion. We found that 3 weeks of treatment with GBT1118 increased the percentage of bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells and upon plerixafor mobilization, the percentage of peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cells. Our data suggest that voxelotor should be further explored for its potential safety and utility as preparation for hematopoietic stem cell mobilization and collection.
31613565	Hematologic Conditions: Common Hemoglobinopathies.	Hemoglobinopathies are genetic disorders that lead to abnormal structure of the hemoglobin molecule. Genetic mutation results in major changes in the hemoglobin structure, with dysfunctions related to changes in shape, oxygen-carrying capacity, or ability to clump together, causing obstruction of the vascular system. Sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia major are two common hemoglobinopathies worldwide. However, they occur infrequently in the United States, with approximately 101,000 individuals affected. Sickle cell disease phenotypically is exhibited in patients with two hemoglobin S genes but the disease broadly includes many other hemoglobin abnormalities. Complications vary according to genotype and include acute pain crisis, vasoocclusive events, and acute chest syndrome. Blood transfusions are a mainstay of therapy. The two main categories of thalassemias are beta thalassemias and alpha thalassemias. Symptoms range from severe to none. The severity depends on how many genes are affected. Patients with the most severe form of beta thalassemia (ie, two affected genes) are categorized as having thalassemia major or transfusion-dependent disease. The primary treatment for beta thalassemia major currently is transfusions, although stem cell transplantation is a potentially curative option.
31784240	Ex vivo immunological evaluation of stable mixed chimeric patients after matched related donor allogeneic transplantation in sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND AIMS: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is curative for sickle cell disease, and the use of matched related donors, non-myeloablative conditioning and sirolimus immunosuppression results in stable mixed chimerism without graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). However, the time to terminate sirolimus while maintaining mixed chimerism is unclear. METHODS: In this study, we developed a two-way mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) to evaluate ex vivo immunoreaction in mixed chimeric patients. RESULTS: In co-culture of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from two healthy controls (without irradiation), we detected proliferation at various ratios of PBMC mixtures (1:9 to 9:1) as well as various concentrations of sirolimus, suggesting that two-way MLR is applicable to patients (having >10% chimerism) undergoing sirolimus treatment. In two-way MLR using PBMCs (including donor and recipient cells) from mixed chimeric patients (n = 28), greater ex vivo proliferation was observed <6 months compared with >6 months post-transplant and healthy control PBMC monoculture. Robust ex vivo proliferation was observed in a patient with acute GVHD, and persistent ex vivo proliferation (until 2 years) was observed in a patient with decreasing donor chimerism. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we demonstrated that in two-way MLR, ex vivo immunoreaction decreases to low levels ~6 months post-transplant. These findings suggest a rationale to continue immunosuppression for 6 months.

38289232	Blood Spotlight Review on Gene Therapy for Sickle Cell Disease.	The root cause of sickle cell anemia has been known for seven decades, yet no curative therapies have been available other than allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, applicability is limited. Two potentially curative therapies based on gene therapy and gene editing strategies are about to enter the final stages of the FDA approval process. This review surveys the nature of these therapies and the opportunities and issues raised by the prospect of definitive genetically based therapies being available in clinical practice.
35133406	GRNDaD: big data and sickle cell disease.	Big data are used in the pursuit of precision medicine in the general population. Applying these tools to patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) is essential for ensuring that they receive the most appropriate customized therapy for their disease. For these tools to be applied, there must be a large number of willing, fully phenotyped participants in collaborative registries. Working collaboratively to respond to unmet clinical needs and the lack of a large multisite registry, SCD providers at multiple sites developed The Globin Regional Data and Discovery (GRNDaD) registry. The specific goals of GRNDaD are to (1) prospectively obtain high-quality curated data on the evolving population affected by SCD; (2) improve adherence to guideline-based care; (3) provide a platform for ongoing quality improvement across sites; (4) allow for real-time investigation of therapies, and collaborate broadly to address research questions using GRNDaD as a shared platform. GRNDaD's current strength lies in the generous participation of people living with SCD, collaborative investigators, and the opportunity to conduct quality improvement activities across a large number of sites. GRNDaD will serve as the data collection tool for the Health Resources and Services Administration Sickle Cell Treatment Demonstration Program and for the newly established National Alliance for Sickle Cell Centers (https://www.sicklecellcenters.org/). GRNDaD is a robust collaborative registry that providers and researchers will use to identify genetic markers that will help predict outcomes and lead to a better understanding of the natural history of SCD in the modern era of novel therapies.
32026613	Can PROMIS domains of pain and physical functioning detect changes in health over time for children with sickle cell disease?	BACKGROUND: The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) includes multiple domains that measure pain and physical functioning which are valid and reliable for use in children with sickle cell disease. The responsiveness of these measures to detect changes in health status over time among children with sickle cell disease is unknown. PROCEDURE: We conducted a prospective cohort study of children presenting to emergency department (ED) with vaso-occlusive crises. Children completed PROMIS surveys in the ED and at two follow-up time points (7-10 days and 1-3 months) after their acute care visit. Linear mixed models were used to determine if there were significant changes in PROMIS T scores over time. We used a patient's global assessment of change in pain question to anchor the changes in PROMIS scores (mean and 95% confidence interval). A change was considered statistically significant if the 95% CI did not include 0. RESULTS: We found that patients improved significantly in all domains 1 to 3 months after discharge from an acute care visit for pain. In addition, the pain and physical stress experience domains were responsive to change 7 to 10 days after discharge. Using the anchor of change in pain, for children who had considerable improvement in pain, there were significant changes in PROMIS T scores ranging from 6 to 15. CONCLUSIONS: Relevant PROMIS domains detect changes in children experiencing acute vaso-occlusive crises. These domains can be used in research and clinic settings to measure clinically relevant change in children with sickle cell disease.
37899028	Sickle Cell Disease and CKD: An Update.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease is an inherited red blood cell disorder that affects approximately 100,000 people in the U.S. and 25 million people worldwide. Vaso-occlusion and chronic hemolysis lead to dysfunction to vital organ systems, with the kidneys being among the most commonly affected organs. SUMMARY: Early renal manifestations include medullary ischemia with loss of urine concentrating ability and hyperfiltration. This can be followed by progressive damage characterized by persistent albuminuria and a decline in the estimated glomerular filtration rate. The risk of sickle nephropathy is greater in those with the APOL1 G1 and G2 kidney risk variants and variants in HMOX1 and lower in those that co-inherit alpha-thalassemia. Therapies to treat sickle cell disease-related kidney damage focus on sickle cell disease modifying therapies (e.g. hydroxyurea) or those adopted from the non-sickle cell disease kidney literature (e.g. renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors), although data on their clinical efficacy are limited to small studies with short follow up periods. Kidney transplantation for end-stage kidney disease improves survival compared to hemodialysis but is underutilized in this patient population. KEY MESSAGES: Kidney disease is a major contributor to early mortality and more research is needed to understand the pathophysiology and to develop targeted therapies to improve kidney health in sickle cell disease.
37204194	Case Ascertainment of Sickle Cell Disease Using Surveillance or Single Administrative Database Case Definitions.	OBJECTIVE: In the absence of access to surveillance system data, single-source administrative databases are often used to study health care utilization and health outcomes among people with sickle cell disease (SCD). We compared the case definitions from single-source administrative databases with a surveillance case definition to identify people with SCD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used data from Sickle Cell Data Collection programs in California and Georgia (2016-2018). The surveillance case definition for SCD developed for the Sickle Cell Data Collection programs uses multiple databases, including newborn screening, discharge databases, state Medicaid programs, vital records, and clinic data. Case definitions for SCD in single-source administrative databases varied by database (Medicaid and discharge) and years of data (1, 2, and 3 years). We calculated the proportion of people meeting the surveillance case definition for SCD that was captured by each single administrative database case definition for SCD, by birth cohort, sex, and Medicaid enrollment. RESULTS: In California, 7117 people met the surveillance case definition of SCD from 2016 through 2018; 48% of this group was captured by the Medicaid case definition and 41% by the discharge case definition. In Georgia, 10 448 people met the surveillance case definition of SCD from 2016 through 2018; 45% of this group was captured by the Medicaid case definition and 51% by the discharge case definition. These proportions differed by years of data, birth cohort, and length of Medicaid enrollment. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: The surveillance case definition identified twice as many people with SCD as the single-source administrative database definitions during the same period, but trade-offs exist in using single administrative databases for decisions on policy and program expansion for SCD.
36992407	Viral Vectors in Gene Therapy: Where Do We Stand in 2023?	Viral vectors have been used for a broad spectrum of gene therapy for both acute and chronic diseases. In the context of cancer gene therapy, viral vectors expressing anti-tumor, toxic, suicide and immunostimulatory genes, such as cytokines and chemokines, have been applied. Oncolytic viruses, which specifically replicate in and kill tumor cells, have provided tumor eradication, and even cure of cancers in animal models. In a broader meaning, vaccine development against infectious diseases and various cancers has been considered as a type of gene therapy. Especially in the case of COVID-19 vaccines, adenovirus-based vaccines such as ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and Ad26.COV2.S have demonstrated excellent safety and vaccine efficacy in clinical trials, leading to Emergency Use Authorization in many countries. Viral vectors have shown great promise in the treatment of chronic diseases such as severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, beta-thalassemia, and sickle cell disease (SCD). Proof-of-concept has been established in preclinical studies in various animal models. Clinical gene therapy trials have confirmed good safety, tolerability, and therapeutic efficacy. Viral-based drugs have been approved for cancer, hematological, metabolic, neurological, and ophthalmological diseases as well as for vaccines. For example, the adenovirus-based drug Gendicine  for non-small-cell lung cancer, the reovirus-based drug Reolysin  for ovarian cancer, the oncolytic HSV T-VEC for melanoma, lentivirus-based treatment of ADA-SCID disease, and the rhabdovirus-based vaccine Ervebo against Ebola virus disease have been approved for human use.
32798305	Outpatient pain clinic and intranasal fentanyl to improve sickle cell disease outcomes.	BACKGROUND: Acute pain events are a leading complication for sickle cell patients. In an attempt to improve pain outcomes, we developed an outpatient pain clinic, and included intranasal fentanyl in the opioid emergency department (ED) pain order set. We evaluated admission rates and opioid administration for patients that attended both the outpatient pain clinic and ED within a 3-month period. METHODS: We recorded the admission rate, IV morphine equivalents, and time from triage for each opioid order and administration from both an outpatient pain clinic and ED visit within a 3-month period for an individual pediatric patient with sickle cell disease. RESULTS: Thirty patients received acute pain management in both settings. We identified a significant reduction in hospital admission when patients received care in the pain clinic as compared to the ED (17% vs 43%, P = .02). Additionally, outpatient pain clinic patients received significantly less IV morphine equivalents than patients received in the ED (5.6 vs 10.6 IV morphine equivalents, P < .0001). In the ED, intranasal fentanyl was administered in a significantly shorter time than patients ordered intravenous opioid (43 vs 75 min, P = .02). The mean time to receiving an opioid in the outpatient pain clinic was 57 min. CONCLUSION: The use of an outpatient pain clinic can reduce admission rates as compared to the ED. The use of intranasal fentanyl reduced the time to first opioid administration in the ED. Patient-centered research or quality improvement projects should continue to focus on novel approaches to acute pain event management.
35854420	An Integrative Review: The Evolution of Provider Knowledge, Attitudes, Perceptions and Perceived Barriers to Caring for Patients with Sickle Cell Disease 1970-Now.	Approximately 100,000 Americans have sickle cell disease (SCD). In the USA, the majority of patients with SCD are of African descent. Due to persistent racial and ethnic disparities in healthcare in the USA, patients with SCD experience disproportionately more health inequities because of providers' implicit biases regarding patient race. Lack of access to health insurance, lack of transportation to healthcare providers, and inadequate provider knowledge contribute to the morbidity and mortality of patients with SCD. The purpose of this integrative review was to analyze and synthesize the literature on providers' knowledge, perceptions, beliefs, and attitudes toward patients with SCD. A modified (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) method was used to conduct a comprehensive review of the literature yielding 31 publications included in this review. Three connected, yet distinct areas of focus were identified: (1) providers' knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of patients with SCD; (2) providers' perceived or true barriers to caring for patients with SCD; and (3) interventions to improve providers' attitudes, perceptions, and care of patients with SCD. In each area of focus, research has evolved over time. Also included in this integrative review is a synthesis of measurement instruments used to assess provider knowledge, attitudes, perceptions, and perceived and true barriers to caring for patients with SCD. Adolescents with SCD who are transitioning from pediatric to adult care are at a particularly high risk for morbidity and mortality, so this review focused on the many opportunities that exist to advance the healthcare for young adults with SCD to improve patient outcomes later in life. This includes improving providers' knowledge, perceptions, beliefs, and attitudes, and lessening the real or perceived barriers to care for patients with SCD.

36701332	Patient-Controlled Analgesia vs Intravenous Push Hydromorphone for Pain Management of Vaso-Occlusive Crisis Associated With Sickle Cell Disease.	Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) appears to be the preferred modality for treatment of pain associated with vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) and is the current standard of therapy at most institutions. With limited data available, this study analyzed the effectiveness of PCA vs intravenous push (IVP) hydromorphone for pain management of VOC. The primary objective was to determine whether PCA or IVP hydromorphone is more effective in controlling VOC pain determined by a reduction in mean absolute difference pain intensity (MPI) from baseline to discharge. This retrospective single-center study evaluated differences in outcomes between patients treated with PCA vs those treated with IVP hydromorphone for VOC during hospital admission. Those 18 years or older admitted with one of the following International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes were included: D57.0 (Hb-SS disease with crisis), D57.2 (sickle cell/Hb-C disease), and D57.4 (sickle cell thalassemia), and administered PCA or IVP hydromorphone. The observed difference in absolute pain scores were not statistically significant (p = 0.753). The use of IVP hydromorphone resulted in a significant reduction in length of stay (LOS) and morphine milligram equivalent (MME) use compared to PCA, but was associated with a numerical increase in treatment failures. This study was limited by its retrospective nature, uneven distribution of groups, and only reviewed use of IVP and PCA hydromorphone at one institution.
33169861	Machine-learning algorithms for predicting hospital re-admissions in sickle cell disease.	Reducing preventable hospital re-admissions in Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) could potentially improve outcomes and decrease healthcare costs. In a retrospective study of electronic health records, we hypothesized Machine-Learning (ML) algorithms may outperform standard re-admission scoring systems (LACE and HOSPITAL indices). Participants (n = 446) included patients with SCD with at least one unplanned inpatient encounter between January 1, 2013, and November 1, 2018. Patients were randomly partitioned into training and testing groups. Unplanned hospital admissions (n = 3299) were stratified to training and testing samples. Potential predictors (n = 486), measured from the last unplanned inpatient discharge to the current unplanned inpatient visit, were obtained via both data-driven methods and clinical knowledge. Three standard ML algorithms, Logistic Regression (LR), Support-Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF) were applied. Prediction performance was assessed using the C-statistic, sensitivity, and specificity. In addition, we reported the most important predictors in our best models. In this dataset, ML algorithms outperformed LACE [C-statistic 0 6, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0 57-0 64] and HOSPITAL (C-statistic 0 69, 95% CI 0 66-0 72), with the RF (C-statistic 0 77, 95% CI 0 73-0 79) and LR (C-statistic 0 77, 95% CI 0 73-0 8) performing the best. ML algorithms can be powerful tools in predicting re-admission in high-risk patient groups.
34329381	Murine bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells have reduced hematopoietic maintenance ability in sickle cell disease.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is characterized by hemolytic anemia, which can trigger oxidative stress, inflammation, and tissue injury that contribute to disease complications. Bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) tightly regulate hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) homeostasis in health and disease, but their functionality in SCD remains unclear. We identified for the first time that murine SCD MSCs have altered gene signatures, reduced stem cell properties, and increased oxidative stress, due in part to hemolysis. Murine SCD MSCs had lower HSC maintenance ability in vitro and in vivo, as manifested by increased HSC mobilization and decreased HSC engraftment after transplant. Activation of Toll-like receptor-4 through p65 in MSCs further contributed to MSC dysfunction. Transfusions led to an improved MSC and HSC oxidative state in SCD mice. Improving the regulation between MSCs and HSCs has vital implications for enhancing clinical HSC transplantation and gene therapy outcomes and for identification of new molecular targets for alleviating SCD complications.

OBJECTIVE: This study examined the impact of executive functioning (EF) on adaptive functioning and self-care independence in pre-transition youth with sickle cell disease (SCD). METHODS: Thirty-four youth with SCD (ages 12-18 years) completed a brief neuropsychological battery and their caregivers completed questionnaires assessing adaptive functioning, EF behaviors, and independence in completing self-care tasks, including disease management. Hierarchical linear regression analyses were utilized to investigate if EF predicted significantly more variability in adaptive functioning and self-care independence than what is accounted for by socioeconomic status (SES), disease knowledge, and estimated intellectual functioning. RESULTS: Mean performance on standardized measures assessing working memory, processing speed, and EF skills fell in the low average range. Performance-based EF and caregiver-reported EF behaviors predicted variance in adaptive functioning and self-care independence above and beyond that accounted for by SES, disease knowledge, and intelligence, with moderate to large effect sizes. CONCLUSIONS: EF skills may support the ability of youth with SCD to adequately achieve independence in self-care, including medical self-care, and other adaptive skills, which may increase the likelihood of successful transition to young adulthood. These findings provide support for the role of neuropsychological screening and individualized intervention in interdisciplinary transition programs.
32881966	Risk factors for osteonecrosis of the femoral head in brain tumor patients receiving corticosteroid after surgery.	PURPOSE: Non-traumatic osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is a plausible complication in brain tumor patients. Frequent use of corticosteroid therapy, chemotherapy, and oxidative stress for managing brain tumors may be associated with the development of ONFH. However, there is little knowledge on the prevalence and risk factors of ONFH from brain tumor. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and risk factors of ONFH in patients with primary brain tumors. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included data from consecutive patients between December 2005 and August 2016 from a tertiary university hospital in South Korea. A total of 73 cases of ONFH were identified among 10,674 primary brain tumor patients. After excluding subjects (25 out of 73) with missing data, history of alcohol consumption or smoking, history of femoral bone trauma or surgery, comorbidities such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), sickle cell disease, cancer patients other than brain tumor, and previous diagnosis of contralateral ONFH, we performed a 1:2 propensity score-matched, case-control study (ONFH group, 48; control group, 96). Risk factors of ONFH in primary brain tumor were evaluated by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: The prevalence of ONFH in patients with surgical resection of primary brain tumor was 683.9 per 100,000 persons (73 of 10,674). In this cohort, 55 of 74 patients (74.3%) underwent THA for ONFH treatment. We found that diabetes was an independent factor associated with an increased risk of ONFH in primary brain tumor patients (OR = 7.201, 95% CI, 1.349-38.453, p = 0.021). There was a significant difference in univariate analysis, including panhypopituitarism (OR = 4.394, 95% CI, 1.794-11.008, p = 0.002), supratentorial location of brain tumor (OR = 2.616, 95% CI, 1.245-5.499, p = 0.011), and chemotherapy (OR = 2.867, 95% CI, 1.018-8.069, p = 0.046). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that the prevalence of ONFH after surgical resection of primary brain tumor was 0.68%. Diabetes was an independent risk factor for developing ONFH, whereas corticosteroid dose was not. Routine screening for brain tumor-associated ONFH is not recommended; however, a high index of clinical suspicion in these patients at risk may allow for early intervention and preservation of the joints.
34115136	Leukemia after gene therapy for sickle cell disease: insertional mutagenesis, busulfan, both, or neither.	Recently, encouraging data provided long-awaited hope for gene therapy as a cure for sickle cell disease (SCD). Nevertheless, the transient suspension of the bluebird bio gene therapy trial (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02140554) after participants developed acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome (AML/MDS) raised concerns. Potential possibilities for these cases include busulfan, insertional mutagenesis, both, or neither. Busulfan was considered the cause in the first reported case because the transgene was not present in the AML/MDS. However, busulfan is unlikely to have contributed to the most recent case. The transgene was present in the patient's malignant cells, indicating they were infused after busulfan treatment. Several lines of evidence suggest an alternative explanation for events in the bluebird bio trial, including that SCD population studies show an increased relative, but a low absolute, risk of AML/MDS. We propose a new hypothesis: after gene therapy for SCD, the stress of switching from homeostatic to regenerative hematopoiesis by transplanted cells drives clonal expansion and leukemogenic transformation of preexisting premalignant clones, eventually resulting in AML/MDS. Evidence validating our hypothesis will support prescreening individuals with SCD for preleukemic progenitors before gene therapy. While presumed viable, safe strategy has been implemented to resume gene therapy in adults with severe SCD, reasonable alternative curative therapy should be considered for children and adults with severe SCD. Currently, open multicenter clinical trials are incorporating nonmyeloablative conditioning, related haploidentical donors, and posttransplantation cyclophosphamide. Preliminary results from these trials appear promising, and National Institutes of Health-sponsored trials are ongoing in individuals with SCD using this platform.
38671412	Health education to promote knowledge about sickle cell disease and newborn screening in pregnant women: a community-based pilot study using the healthy beginning initiative.	BACKGROUND: Pregnancy presents a critical period for any maternal and child health intervention that may impact the health of the newborn. With low antenatal care attendance by pregnant women in health facilities in Nigeria, community-based programs could enable increased reach for health education about sickle cell disease (SCD) and newborn screening (NBS) among pregnant women. This pilot study aimed to assess the effect of education on the knowledge about SCD and NBS among pregnant women using the Healthy Beginning Initiative, a community-based framework. METHODS: A pre-post study design was used to evaluate knowledge of SCD and NBS in a convenience sample of 89 consenting pregnant women from three communities. Participants were given surveys prior to and following completion of a health education session. McNemar's test was used to compare the proportion of participants with correct responses. The level of significance was taken as p < 0.05. RESULTS: Compared to pre-test values, post-test values showed that participants understood that SCD is hereditary (93.3% vs. 69.7%), both parents must have at least one gene for someone to have SCD (98.9% vs. 77.5) and blood test is the right way to know if one has SCD (98.8% vs. 78.7%). Also, a large proportion of participants (post-test ~ 89.9%; compared to pre-test ~ 23.6%) understood that the chance of conceiving a child with SCD was 25% for a couple with the sickle cell trait (SCT). Knowledge of the possibility of diagnosing SCD shortly after birth was highly increased in the post test phase of the study when compared to the pre-test phase (93.3% vs. 43.9%, respectively). Concerning the overall knowledge scores, those with high level of knowledge significantly increase from 12.6% pretest to 87.4% posttest (p = 0.015). CONCLUSION: The health education intervention was associated with significant improvement on almost all measures of SCD knowledge. Focused health education for pregnant women using community structures can improve knowledge of SCD and NBS.
31789599	Use of Mobile Health Apps and Wearable Technology to Assess Changes and Predict Pain During Treatment of Acute Pain in Sickle Cell Disease: Feasibility Study.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited red blood cell disorder affecting millions worldwide, and it results in many potential medical complications throughout the life course. The hallmark of SCD is pain. Many patients experience daily chronic pain as well as intermittent, unpredictable acute vaso-occlusive painful episodes called pain crises. These pain crises often require acute medical care through the day hospital or emergency department. Following presentation, a number of these patients are subsequently admitted with continued efforts of treatment focused on palliative pain control and hydration for management. Mitigating pain crises is challenging for both the patients and their providers, given the perceived unpredictability and subjective nature of pain. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to show the feasibility of using objective, physiologic measurements obtained from a wearable device during an acute pain crisis to predict patient-reported pain scores (in an app and to nursing staff) using machine learning techniques. METHODS: For this feasibility study, we enrolled 27 adult patients presenting to the day hospital with acute pain. At the beginning of pain treatment, each participant was given a wearable device (Microsoft Band 2) that collected physiologic measurements. Pain scores from our mobile app, Technology Resources to Understand Pain Assessment in Patients with Pain, and those obtained by nursing staff were both used with wearable signals to complete time stamp matching and feature extraction and selection. Following this, we constructed regression and classification machine learning algorithms to build between-subject pain prediction models. RESULTS: Patients were monitored for an average of 3.79 (SD 2.23) hours, with an average of 5826 (SD 2667) objective data values per patient. As expected, we found that pain scores and heart rate decreased for most patients during the course of their stay. Using the wearable sensor data and pain scores, we were able to create a regression model to predict subjective pain scores with a root mean square error of 1.430 and correlation between observations and predictions of 0.706. Furthermore, we verified the hypothesis that the regression model outperformed the classification model by comparing the performances of the support vector machines (SVM) and the SVM for regression. CONCLUSIONS: The Microsoft Band 2 allowed easy collection of objective, physiologic markers during an acute pain crisis in adults with SCD. Features can be extracted from these data signals and matched with pain scores. Machine learning models can then use these features to feasibly predict patient pain scores.
33724440	Prophylactic antibiotics for preventing pneumococcal infection in children with sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of inherited disorders that result in haemoglobin abnormalities and other complications. Injury to the spleen, among other factors, contribute to persons with SCD being particularly susceptible to infection. Infants and very young children are especially vulnerable. The 'Co-operative Study of Sickle Cell Disease' observed an incidence rate for pneumococcal septicaemia of 10 per 100 person-years in children under the age of three years. Vaccines, including customary pneumococcal vaccines, may be of limited use in this age group. Therefore, prophylactic penicillin regimens may be advisable for this population. This is an update of a Cochrane Review which was first published in 2002, and previously updated, most recently in 2017.  OBJECTIVES: To compare the effects of antibiotic prophylaxis against pneumococcus in children with SCD receiving antibiotic prophylaxis compared to those without in relation to: 1. incidence of Streptococcus pneumoniae infection; 2. mortality (as reported in the included studies); 3. drug-related adverse events (as reported in the included studies) to the individual and the community; 4. the impact of discontinuing at various ages on incidence of infection and mortality. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, which is comprised of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and also two clinical trials registries: ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Registry Platform (not in 2020 given access issues relating to Covid-19 pandemic). Additionally, we carried out hand searching of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of the most recent search: 25 January 2021. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing prophylactic antibiotics to prevent pneumococcal infection in children with SCD with placebo, no treatment or a comparator drug. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane were used. Both authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. The authors used the GRADE criteria to assess the certainty of the evidence. MAIN RESULTS: Six trials were identified by the searches, of which three trials were eligible for inclusion. A total of 880 children, who were between three months to five years of age at randomization were included. The included studies were conducted in centres in the USA and in Kingston, Jamaica. In trials that investigated initiation of penicillin on risk of pneumococcal infection, the odds ratio was 0.37 (95% confidence interval 0.16 to 0.86) (two trials, 457 children) (low-certainty evidence), while for withdrawal the odds ratio was 0.49 (95% confidence interval 0.09 to 2.71) (one trial, 400 children) (low-certainty evidence). Adverse drug effects were rare and minor. Rates of pneumococcal infection were found to be relatively low in children over the age of five years. Overall, the certainty of the evidence for all outcomes was judged to be low. The results from the risk of bias assessment undertaken identified two domains in which the risk of bias was considered to be high, these were incomplete outcome data (attrition bias) (two trials) and allocation concealment (selection bias) (one trial). Domains considered to have a low risk of bias for all three trials were selective reporting (reporting bias) and blinding (performance and detection bias). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The evidence examined was determined to be of low certainty and suggests that prophylactic penicillin significantly reduces risk of pneumococcal infection in children with homozygous SCD, and is associated with minimal adverse reactions. Further research may help to determine the ideal age to safely withdraw penicillin.
35339238	Considerations When Aggregating Data to Measure Performance Across Levels of the Health Care System.	BACKGROUND: Measuring quality at varying levels of the health care system requires attribution, a process of determining the patients and services for which each level is responsible. However, it is important to ensure that attribution approaches are equitable; otherwise, individuals may be assigned differentially based upon social determinants of health. METHODS: First, we used Medicaid claims (2010-2018) from Michigan to assess the proportion of children with sickle cell anemia who had less than 12 months enrollment within a single Medicaid health plan and could therefore not be attributed to a specific health plan. Second, we used the Medicaid Analytic eXtract data (2008-2009) from 26 states to simulate adapting the 30-Day Pediatric All-Condition Readmission measure to the Accountable Care Organization (ACO) level and examined the proportion of readmissions that could not be attributed. RESULTS: For the sickle cell measure, an average of 300 children with sickle cell anemia were enrolled in Michigan Medicaid each year. The proportion of children that could not be attributed to a Medicaid health plan ranged from 12.2% to 89.0% across years. For the readmissions measure, of the 1,051,365 index admissions, 22% were excluded in the ACO-level analysis because of being unable to attribute the patient to a health plan for the 30 days post discharge. CONCLUSIONS: When applying attribution models, it is essential to consider the potential to induce health disparities. Differential attribution may have unintentional consequences that deepen health disparities, particularly when considering incentive programs for health plans to improve the quality of care.

32716125	Household material hardships impact emergency department reliance in pediatric patients with sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: In sickle cell disease (SCD), high emergency department (ED) utilization is associated with worse outcomes and increased costs. A metric called ED reliance (EDr), the percentage of healthcare visits that occur in the ED, attempts to identify ED overutilization. It is unknown if household material hardships (HMH)-housing, utility, or food insecurity-impact reliance on the ED. As these may represent modifiable risk factors for high ED utilization, we aimed to estimate the association between HMH and EDr in pediatric patients with SCD. METHODS: We reviewed the electronic medical records of pediatric patients with SCD who received care in the Boston Medical Center network in Massachusetts, USA, to collect data on HMH and healthcare utilization. Using linear regression to control for potential confounders, we modeled the association between material hardships and EDr. RESULTS: Of 101 eligible patients, 60 (59%) reported one or more HMH. The mean EDr was 12% overall, with significant differences between those with and without HMH (15.9 vs 5.9, P = 0.0001). Each additional hardship experienced was associated with an increased average EDr of 7.7 percentage points (R2  = 0.34, P < 0.0001). Housing and utility hardships were each independently associated with increased EDr. CONCLUSION: HMH are associated with significantly increased EDr in children with SCD, independent of transportation hardship or insurance type. Through screening for HMH, providers and health systems could identify at-risk patients with modifiable risk factors for high EDr in order to provide them additional support.
33792218	Red cell transfusion and alloimmunization in sickle cell disease.	Red cell transfusion remains a critical component of care for acute and chronic complications of sickle cell disease. Randomized clinical trials demonstrated the benefits of transfusion therapy for prevention of primary and secondary strokes and postoperative acute chest syndrome. Transfusion for splenic sequestration, acute chest syndrome, and acute stroke are guided by expert consensus recommendations. Despite overall improvements in blood inventory safety, adverse effects of transfusion are prevalent among patients with sickle cell disease and include alloimmunization, acute and delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions, and iron overload. Judicious use of red cell transfusions, optimization of red cell antigen matching, and the use of erythrocytapheresis and iron chelation can minimize adverse effects. Early recognition and management of hemolytic transfusion reactions can avert poor clinical outcomes. In this review, we discuss transfusion methods, indications, and complications in sickle cell disease with an emphasis on alloimmunization.
32951731	Randomized phase 2 trial of Intravenous Gamma Globulin (IVIG) for the treatment of acute vaso-occlusive crisis in patients with sickle cell disease: Lessons learned from the midpoint analysis.	Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is a chronic hemolytic disorder associated with frequent pain episodes, end organ damage and a shortened lifespan. Currently there exist no disease specific targeted therapies for the treatment of acute vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) and management with analgesics and hydration is purely supportive. Improvement in understanding of disease pathophysiology has resulted in a great interest in disease modifying novel therapies and many are being evaluated in clinical trials. Here we report the results from the pre-specified mid-point analysis of the Phase 2 study of Intravenous Gamma Globulin (IVIG) for the treatment of acute VOC in patients with SCD and lessons learned.
33798750	Fluorescence spectroscopy as a novel technique for premarital screening of sickle cell disorders.	Spectral diagnostic screening for sickle cell disease was carried out on volunteer blood samples (N = 100). The samples were subjected to different diagnostic methods including conventional complete blood count (CBC), hemoglobin electrophoresis (HBE) and spectral diagnosis. For the spectral diagnostic method, we discriminated three different characteristic spectral features. In total, 15 samples were sickle cell trait (SCT), 34 samples were sickle cell disease (SCD), and the rest of the samples (N = 51) were normal controls. The spectral discrimination of the three different sets of samples was distinguished on the quantification of fluorescent biomolecules such as tyrosine, tryptophan, NADH, FAD, and porphyrins. The results were compared with the conventional standard CBC and capillary electrophoresis findings. The spectral diagnosis method exhibited a sensitivity and specificity greater than 90 % for the tested samples. This technique requires only 5 mL blood samples, has an analysis time of 20 min, exhibits high accuracy and may be used in small clinics in remote villages.
38066847	Managing pregnancy in patients with sickle cell disease from a transfusion perspective.	Advances in the management of sickle cell disease (SCD) have made it possible for most female patients (whether homozygous or compound heterozygous) to reach childbearing age and become pregnant. However, even in the less symptomatic forms of SCD a high risk of complications during pregnancy and the postpartum period can occur for both the mother (1% to 2% mortality) and the fetus. Coordinated care from the obstetrician and the sickle cell disease expert is essential, together with the active participation of the patient. Vaso-occlusive complications, such as vaso-occlusive crisis and acute chest syndrome, often increase in frequency when hydroxyurea treatment is interrupted. Obstetric complications, such as pre-eclampsia, fetal growth restriction, and preterm delivery, are more common in women with SCD. Recent meta-analysis-based studies support prophylactic transfusion. However, there have been no randomized trials assessing the benefits of prophylactic transfusion. Given the known risk of transfusion complications, including delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction and hyperhemolysis, transfusion is not systematically performed in pregnant women with SCD. We describe here a case-by-case approach to the management of pregnancy in women with SCD based on the medical and transfusion history of each patient.
34160085	Process and procedural adjustments to improve CD34+ collection efficiency of hematopoietic progenitor cell collections in sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Adequate CD34+ collection efficiency (CE) is critical to achieve target CD34+ cell doses in hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) collections. Autologous HPC collection in sickle cell disease (SCD) is associated with unstable collection interfaces and low CD34+ CEs. We hypothesized that variables specific to SCD, activation of blood cells and elevated viscosity, might contribute to these issues and made adjustments to the collection process and procedure to address our hypothesis. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In two patients with SCD undergoing autologous HPC collection on our clinical trial (NCT02193191), we therefore implemented adjustments to the process and procedure in the following areas: proximity of RBC exchange to HPC collection, the type of anticoagulation, and the packing factor setting. RESULTS: There was no collection interface instability. Our CD34+ CE1s were high at 70% and 51%, and granulocyte CE, platelet CE, and product granulocyte % were remarkably low. Product hematocrits were not as high as previously reported to be required to obtain adequate CEs. Interestingly, one HPC product showed a hemoglobin S (HbS) of 91% at the same time that the peripheral blood (PB) showed a HbS of 22%. DISCUSSION: Adjustments to the HPC collection process and procedure were associated with adequate CD34+ CEs and low granulocyte and platelet contamination in HPC products from SCD patients. Given the discrepancy in the percentage of sickle RBCs in the product versus the PB, we hypothesize that CD34+ cells and RBCs may aggregate. Our interventions and hypothesis should be further investigated in larger studies.
32147028	Acupuncture for pediatric sickle cell pain management: A promising non-opioid therapy.	OBJECTIVE: To describe the use of acupuncture for pain management in children with sickle cell disease. DESIGN: A retrospective chart review of a single-institution experience on the use of acupuncture in pediatric patients with sickle cell disease was evaluated between 2012-2019. Demographic characteristics, presenting pain location, pain scores pre- and post-acupuncture, and adverse events were collected. SETTING: Columbia University Medical Center, NewYork-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital Pediatric Hematology outpatient and inpatient units. INTERVENTIONS: Acupuncture was performed by six licensed acupuncturists. Point prescriptions were based on pain location, philosophies of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Japanese Style of Kiiko Matsumoto acupuncture. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Pain reduction as measured by two Verbal Pain Scales. RESULTS: Ninety acupuncture treatments were administered to twenty-four patients with sickle cell disease: median age 17.5 years, 62 % female, 37.5 % African American, 50 % Hispanic. The mean treatment duration was 18.5 +- 4.8 min. Fifty-five treatments had documented pre/post-acupuncture pain scores. Pain reduction was achieved in 65.5 % of these treatments. A 0-10 pain scale used in 13 treatments reported a mean pre-acupuncture score of 7.31 +- 1.75, post-acupuncture score of 6.08 +- 1.85, and a mean pain score change of 1.23 +- 1.09 (p = 0.11); A 0-4 pain scale used in 42 treatments reported a mean pre-acupuncture pain score of 3.31 +- 0.72, post-acupuncture score of 2.33 +- 0.98, and a mean pain score change of 0.98 +- 0.99 (p < 0.0001). No adverse events were noted. CONCLUSION: Acupuncture therapy decreased pain for our patients with sickle cell disease, providing a safe non-opioid therapeutic option.
34889368	Hematopoietic cell transplantation for sickle cell disease: updates and future directions.	Excellent outcomes in hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) from HLA-identical siblings, improvements in conditioning regimens, novel graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis, and the availability of alternative donors have all contributed to the increased applicability and acceptability of HCT for sickle cell disease (SCD). In young children with symptomatic SCD with an available HLA-identical related donor, HCT should be carefully considered. HCT from alternative donors is typically undertaken only in patients with severe symptoms, causing or likely to cause organ damage, and in the context of clinical trials. Patients undergoing HCT for SCD require careful counseling and preparation. They require careful monitoring of unique organ toxicities and complications during HCT. Patients must be prospectively followed for a prolonged time to determine the long-term outcomes and late effects of HCT for SCD. Thus, there is a need for a universal, longitudinal clinical registry to follow patients after HCT for SCD in conjunction with individuals who do not receive HCT to compare outcomes. Antibody-based conditioning and ex-vivo umbilical cord blood expansion are likely to improve the availability and acceptability of HCT. In addition, new disease-modifying drugs and the emerging option of the autologous transplantation of gene-modified hematopoietic progenitor cells are likely to expand the available therapeutic options and make decision-making by patients, physicians, and caregivers even more complicated. Future efforts must also focus on determining the impact of socioeconomic status on access to and outcomes of HCT and the long-term impact of HCT on patients, families, and society.
37182559	CRISPR/Cas9-based gene-editing technology for sickle cell disease.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common monogenic hematologic disorder and is essentially congenital hemolytic anemia caused by an inherited point mutation in the beta-globin on chromosome 11. Although the genetic basis of SCD was revealed as early as 1957, treatment options for SCD have been very limited to date. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) was thought to hold promise as a cure for SCD, but the available donors were still only 15% useful. Gene therapy has advanced rapidly into the 21st century with the promise of a cure for SCD, and gene editing strategies based on the cluster-based regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat sequence (CRISPR)/Cas9 system have revolutionized the field of gene therapy by precisely targeting genes. In this paper, we review the pathogenesis and therapeutic approaches of SCD, briefly summarize the delivery strategies of CRISPR/Cas9, and finally discuss in depth the current status, application barriers, and solution directions of CRISPR/Cas9 in SCD. Through the review in this paper, we hope to provide some references for gene therapy in SCD.
31679762	Examining the Role of Complement in Predicting, Preventing, and Treating Hemolytic Transfusion Reactions.	Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion is a critical component of optimal management for a broad range of conditions. Regardless of the indication, pretransfusion testing is required to appropriately match RBC donors and recipients to provide immunologically compatible blood. Although this approach is effective in the vast majority of situations, occasionally, patients will inadvertently receive an incompatible RBC transfusion, which can result in a hemolytic transfusion reaction (HTR). In addition, patients with life-threatening anemia and a complex alloantibody profile, which precludes rapid procurement of compatible RBCs, may also receive incompatible RBCs, placing them at risk for an HTR. Despite the rarity of these clinical situations, when incompatible blood transfusion results in an HTR, the consequences can be devastating. In this review, we will explore the challenges associated with actively preventing and treating acute HTRs following incompatible RBC transfusion. In doing so, we will focus primarily on the role of complement, not only as a key player in HTRs, but also as a potential target for the prevention and treatment of HTRs.
33247605	Positive effects of ultrasound-guided peripheral IV insertion on pediatric sickle cell anemia/thalassemia patients receiving automated red cell exchange procedures or chronic transfusion therapy.	BACKGROUND: Peripheral vascular access and venipuncture are major causes of distress and anxiety for children and their parents. This is especially difficult for patients with hemoglobinopathies (thalassemia major and sickle cell disease) who require chronic blood transfusions. These patients require peripheral venous access for regular blood transfusions and (in the case of sickle cell disease) for automated red cell exchange procedures. Peripheral intravenous (PIV) catheters are much preferred to central venous lines as they carry far fewer risks. However, when patients experience multiple unsuccessful attempts to initiate a PIV, it can be traumatizing and cause anxiety for future visits. Establishing therapeutic trust and ensuring a smooth experience are of paramount importance for these chronic patients who require regular blood transfusions. AIM: The purpose of this study was to determine whether ultrasound-guided PIV insertion decreases PIV-associated pain and anxiety, and whether the number of attempts and amount of time spent accessing PIVs in children with difficult peripheral intravenous (DPIV) access is reduced. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a pilot study with both retrospective and prospective components. Hemoglobinopathies are relatively rare in our population and our study cohort was small (N = 18). RESULTS: We identified four DPIV access patients. We recorded each time these patients had a PIV inserted as an encounter. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: We found that while there was a small amount of time gained by using ultrasound-guided PIV insertion, patient and parent satisfaction was significantly improved.
33708318	Health insurance and the financial implications of sickle cell disease among parents of affected children attending a tertiary facility in Lagos, south-west Nigeria.	INTRODUCTION: there is a paucity of data on the financial implications of sickle cell disease on households of affected children and their use of health insurance in Nigeria. This study assessed the awareness of health insurance, patterns of health service utilization and financial implications of sickle cell disease among children seeking care at a tertiary facility in Nigeria. METHODS: a structured questionnaire was administered to parents of 314 children with sickle cell disease attending the pediatric hematology unit of the Lagos University Teaching Hospital between May and December 2019. RESULTS: mean age of the children was 91.5 +- 43.1 months. M: F was 1.17: 1. 45.5% of households earned above NGN 150,000 (USD 417) monthly. 71.3% of the parents had heard of health insurance but only 20.7% were enrolled in a health insurance scheme. Awareness of health insurance was significantly associated with social class (p=0.000) and monthly household income (p=0.000). 60.8% of the parents preferred pre-facility treatment. Social class (p=0.01) and monthly household income (p=0.001) were significantly associated with home treatment. Time on admission ranged from 2-18 days with an average of 4.31 days. Average cost of hospitalization was USD 148 +- USD 14.2 and total cost of care incurred was USD 20,787. Neither age of child (p=0.857), estimated household income (p=0.863) nor social class (p=0.397) was associated with cost of care. CONCLUSION: a high cost of care was observed in our study population underscoring the need for increased awareness and access to health insurance for households of children with sickle cell disease.

31907250	Sickle-Cell Disease Co-Management, Health Care Utilization, and Hydroxyurea Use.	BACKGROUND: Sickle-cell disease (SCD) causes significant morbidity, premature mortality, and high disease burden, resulting in frequent health care use. Comanagement may improve utilization and patient adherence with treatments such as Hydroxyurea. The purpose of this study was to describe acute-care utilization in Medicaid-enrolled patients with SCD, patient factors associated with comanagement, and adherence to Hydroxyurea. METHODS: Data from 2790 patients diagnosed with SCD, age 1 to 65+ years, enrolled at least 1 month in North Carolina Medicaid between March 2016 and February 2017, were analyzed. Outpatient visits were categorized as primary care, hematologist, and nonhematologist specialist. Nurse practitioners or physician assistants with unidentified specialty type or family practice were categorized separately. Comanagement was defined as a minimum of 1 primary care and 1 hematologist visit/patient during the study period. RESULTS: There were notable age-related differences in utilization of health care services. Only 34.82% of the sample was comanaged. Comanagement was higher in the 1-to-9-year-old (44.88%) and 10-to-17-year-old groups (39.22%) versus the 31-to-45-year-old (30.26%) and 65+-year-old (18.75%) age groups. Age had the greatest influence (AUC = 0.599) on whether or not a patient was comanaged. Only a third of the sample (32.24%) had at least 1 Hydroxyurea (HU) prescription. Age was the most predictive factor of good HUadherence (AUC = 0.6503). Prediction by comanagement was minimal with an AUC = 0.5615. CONCLUSION: Comanagement was a factor in predicting HUadherence, but further studies are needed to identify the frequency and components of comanagement needed to increase adherence and reduce acute care utilization.
35075288	Long-term outcomes of lentiviral gene therapy for the beta-hemoglobinopathies: the HGB-205 trial.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia (TDT) are the most prevalent monogenic disorders worldwide. Trial HGB-205 ( NCT02151526 ) aimed at evaluating gene therapy by autologous CD34+ cells transduced ex vivo with lentiviral vector BB305 that encodes the anti-sickling betaA-T87Q-globin expressed in the erythroid lineage. HGB-205 is a phase 1/2, open-label, single-arm, non-randomized interventional study of 2-year duration at a single center, followed by observation in long-term follow-up studies LTF-303 ( NCT02633943 ) and LTF-307 ( NCT04628585 ) for TDT and SCD, respectively. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were similar to those for allogeneic transplantation but restricted to patients lacking geno-identical, histocompatible donors. Four patients with TDT and three patients with SCD, ages 13-21 years, were treated after busulfan myeloablation 4.6-7.9 years ago, with a median follow-up of 4.5 years. Key primary endpoints included mortality, engraftment, replication-competent lentivirus and clonal dominance. No adverse events related to the drug product were observed. Clinical remission and remediation of biological hallmarks of the disease have been sustained in two of the three patients with SCD, and frequency of transfusions was reduced in the third. The patients with TDT are all transfusion free with improvement of dyserythropoiesis and iron overload.
31803937	Treatment for avascular necrosis of bone in people with sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Avascular necrosis of bone is a frequent and severe complication of sickle cell disease and its treatment is not standardised. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. OBJECTIVES: To determine the impact of any surgical procedure compared with other surgical interventions or non-surgical procedures, on avascular necrosis of bone in people with sickle cell disease in terms of efficacy and safety. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Additional trials were sought from both ongoing trial registries and the reference lists of papers identified by the search strategy. Date of the most recent search of the Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 17 September 2019. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized clinical trials comparing specific therapies for avascular necrosis of bone in people with sickle cell disease. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Each author independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. Given only one trial was identified, meta-analyses were not possible. MAIN RESULTS: One trial (46 participants) was eligible for inclusion. After randomization eight participants were withdrawn, mainly because they declined to participate in the trial. Data were analysed for 38 participants at the end of the trial. After a mean follow-up of three years, hip core decompression and physical therapy did not show clinical improvement when compared with physical therapy alone using the score from the original trial (an improvement of 18.1 points for those treated with intervention therapy versus an improvement of 15.7 points with control therapy). We are very uncertain whether there is any difference between groups regarding major complications (hip pain, risk ratio 0.95 (95% confidence interval 0.56 to 1.60; vaso-occlusive crises, risk ratio 1.14 (95% confidence interval 0.72 to 1.80; very low quality of evidence); and acute chest syndrome, risk ratio 1.06 (95% confidence interval 0.44 to 2.56; very low quality of evidence)). This trial did not report results on mortality or quality of life. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence that adding hip core decompression to physical therapy achieves clinical improvement in people with sickle cell disease with avascular necrosis of bone compared to physical therapy alone. However, we highlight that our conclusion is based on one trial with high attrition rates. Further randomized controlled trials are necessary to evaluate the role of hip-core depression for this clinical condition. Endpoints should focus on participants' subjective experience (e.g. quality of life and pain) as well as more objective 'time-to-event' measures (e.g. mortality, survival, hip longevity). The availability of participants to allow adequate trial power will be a key consideration for endpoint choice.
31925819	Treating sickle cell anemia: A new era dawns.	
37920880	Acute kidney injury is more common in hospitalised children with sickle cell anaemia in Africa.	AIM: To document the prevalence, severity, hospital outcome and factors associated with acute kidney injury (AKI) in hospitalised children with sickle cell anaemia (SCA). METHODS: In this prospective observational study involving children aged 0.5-17 years with SCA requiring hospitalisation, we used serum creatinine level at 0 and 48 h of hospitalisation to determine the presence of AKI. RESULTS: The study involved 155 children with SCA aged 0.5-17 years with a median (interquartile range) age of 7.8 (4.3-11.0) years. Acute kidney injury occurred in 27 (17.4%) children with 33.3% reaching stage 3. Hepatomegaly (81.5% vs. 55.4%; p = 0.015), splenomegaly (33.3% vs. 10.9%; p = 0.003), dipstick proteinuria (22.2% vs. 5.4%; p = 0.004), and hematuria (29.6% vs. 3.1%; p = <0.001) were more common in those with AKI. In contrast, children with AKI had lower haematocrit (16.9% vs. 22.2%; p = <0.001) and serum bicarbonate (16.7 vs. 19.1 mmoL/L; p = 0.010) compared with those without AKI. Those with AKI had longer hospital stay (median [interquartile range]: 7 [4-12] days vs. 4 [3-6] days; p = 0.008). CONCLUSION: AKI is common among hospitalised children with AKI and is associated with longer hospital stay.
38279581	Decreasing alloimmunization-specific mortality in sickle cell disease in the United States: Cost-effectiveness of a shared transfusion resource.	Red blood cell alloimmunization and consequent delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction (DHTR) incidence and mortality in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) are high. A shared transfusion resource has decreased both in other countries, while in the United States cost concerns persist. We conducted a Markov cohort simulation of a birth cohort of alloimmunized patients with SCD to estimate lifetime DHTR incidence, DHTR-specific mortality, quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE), and costs with the implementation of a shared transfusion resource to identify antibody history versus without (i.e., status quo). We conducted our analysis using a lifetime analytic time horizon and from a United States health system perspective. Implementation of shared transfusion resource projects to decrease cumulative DHTR-specific mortality by 26% for alloimmunized patients with SCD in the United States, relative to the status quo. For an average patient population of 32 000, this intervention would generate a discounted increment of 4000 QALYs at an incremental discounted cost of $0.3 billion, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $75 600/QALY [95% credible interval $70 200-81 400/QALY]. The results are most sensitive to the baseline lifetime medical expenditure of patients with SCD. Alloantibody data exchange is cost-effective in 100% of 10 000 Monte Carlo simulations. The resource would theoretically need a minimum patient population of 1819 patients or cost no more than $5.29 million annually to be cost-effective. By reducing DHTR-specific mortality, a shared transfusion resource in the United States projects to be a life-saving and cost-effective intervention for patients with SCD in the United States.
32034776	Curative options for sickle cell disease: haploidentical stem cell transplantation or gene therapy?	Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is curative in sickle cell disease (SCD); however, the lack of available matched donors makes this therapy out of reach for the majority of patients with SCD. Alternative donor sources such as haploidentical HSCT expand the donor pool to nearly all patients with SCD, with recent data showing high overall survival, limited toxicities, and effective reduction in acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Simultaneously, multiple gene therapy strategies are entering clinical trials with preliminary data showing their success, theoretically offering all patients yet another curative strategy without the morbidity and mortality of GVHD. As improvements are made for alternative donors in the allogeneic setting and as data emerge from gene therapy trials, the optimal curative strategy for any individual patient with SCD will be determined by many critical factors including efficacy, transplant morbidity and mortality, safety, patient disease status and preference, cost and applicability. Haploidentical may be the preferred choice now based mostly on availability of data; however, gene therapy is closing the gap and may ultimately prove to be the better option. Progress in both strategies, however, makes cure more attainable for the individual with SCD.
32815878	Physical Therapy in Pediatric and Young Adult Patients With Sickle Cell Disease: Assessing Potential Benefits and Barriers.	BACKGROUND: Despite advances in the treatment of sickle cell disease (SCD) in pediatric and young adult patients, pain remains a significant cause of disease-related morbidity. Physical therapy has been shown to be useful for the treatment of pain in young patients with chronic illnesses, however, limited data exists regarding potential benefits of physical therapy in patients with SCD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a web-based survey of health care providers and support staff in the New England area to identify potential benefits of and barriers to outpatient physical therapy in this patient population. RESULTS: Nearly 92% of survey participants felt that physical therapy had the potential to be beneficial in pediatric and young adult patients with SCD. A majority of physicians reported having referred patients with SCD for physical therapy. Perceived potential benefits included improved functional mobility, improved chronic pain symptoms, decreased opiate use, improved mood symptoms, improved acute pain symptoms, and improved adherence with medications and clinic visits. Significant perceived barriers identified included lack of transportation, time constraints, patient lack of understanding, and difficulty with insurance coverage. CONCLUSIONS: Health care providers have a positive view of the use of physical therapy in the management of this patient population. Significant barriers exist which need to be addressed.
32301178	The vaso-occlusive pain crisis in sickle cell disease: Definition, pathophysiology, and management.	Early diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of a vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) are critical to the management of patients with sickle cell disease. It is essential to differentiate between VOC-associated pain and chronic pain, hyperalgesia, neuropathy, and neuropathic pain. The pathophysiology of VOCs includes polymerization of abnormal sickle hemoglobin, inflammation, and adhesion. Hydroxyurea, L-glutamine, crizanlizumab, and voxelotor have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for reducing the frequency of VOCs; the European Medicines Agency has approved only hydroxyurea. Other novel treatments are in late-stage clinical development in both the United States and the European Union. The development of agents for prevention and treatment of VOCs should be driven by our understanding of its pathophysiology.

38019672	Sirolimus-induced Hypertriglyceridemia Leads to Acute Pancreatitis and Diabetic Ketoacidosis Post Stem Cell Transplant for Sickle Cell Disease.	Sirolimus (mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor) is a potent immunosuppressive agent, used in patients receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) for Graft vs Host disease prophylaxis. Compared to calcineurin inhibitors, sirolimus has no neurotoxicity or nephrotoxicity, but sirolimus causes dose-dependent thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, delayed wound healing, hyperlipidemia, and hypertriglyceridemia. Here we report a case of acute pancreatitis and diabetic ketoacidosis in a patient with sickle cell disease post haploidentical family donor HSCT which was managed conservatively without plasmapheresis. Based on our review of the literature, this is the first reported case of developing acute pancreatitis as an adverse effect of sirolimus-induced hypertriglyceridemia leading to diabetic ketoacidosis in a recipient of HSCT.
33275666	Social aspects of chronic transfusions: addressing social determinants of health, health literacy, and quality of life.	Chronic monthly transfusions are a lifesaving preventative therapy for many patients with sickle cell disease; however, the burden of this therapy for patients and families is high. In the United States, there is overlap in the population affected by sickle cell disease and those with the greatest burden of social needs. Hematology providers caring for patients with SCD have an opportunity to screen for and mitigate social determinants of health, especially in those receiving chronic transfusion therapy given the frequent interactions with the healthcare system and increased demand on already potentially limited resources. Given the complexity of the treatment and medication regimens, providers caring for patients receiving chronic transfusions should implement universal strategies to minimize the impact of low health literacy, as this therapy imposes a significant demand on the health literacy skills of a family. Despite the social and literacy burden of this intervention, it is reassuring that quality of life is preserved as patients with SCD on chronic transfusion therapy often report higher health related quality of life than their peers receiving other disease modifying therapies.
38770886	The hope, hype and obstacles surrounding cell therapy.	Cell therapy offers hope, but it also presents challenges, most particularly the limited ability of human organs and tissues to regenerate. Since many diseases are associated with irreversible pathophysiological or traumatic changes, stem cells and their derivatives are unable to secure healing. Although regenerative medicine offers chances for improvements in many diseases, such as type one diabetes and Parkinson's disease, it cannot eliminate the primary cause of many of them. While successes can be expected for diseases such as sickle cell disease, this is not the case for hereditary diseases with varied mutation types or for ciliopathies, which start in embryogenesis. In this complicated medical environment, synthetic biology offers some solutions, but their implementation will take many years. Still, positive examples such as CAR-T therapy offer hope.
32315707	Fertility Concerns and Access to Care for Stem Cell Transplantation Candidates with Sickle Cell Disease.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) affects 100,000 Americans and causes significant psychiatric illness and poor quality of life in many domains, including infertility. Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is the only available cure for SCD, but it can entail chronic toxicities, including psychiatric conditions, such as depression and anxiety, and sterility in both men and women. There is scant literature on fertility or psychiatric outcomes for patients with SCD receiving HCT, and none considering the additive ramifications of the stresses of SCD, transplantation, and infertility. Financial toxicity is a significant concern for all patients undergoing HCT. Treatment for infertility is also very expensive, and access to fertility services is variable in the United States, adding to the medical and quality of life burden for this patient population. Here we review the relevant areas of SCD and infertility, SCD and psychiatric wellness, access to care, and infertility and quality of life. Collectively, these data suggest that the group of patients with SCD who undergo HCT and experience infertility are at particularly high risk for poor quality of life, worsening psychiatric health, and poor access to adequate fertility treatment.
36994864	Efficacy of non-pharmacological interventions to reduce pain in children with sickle cell disease: A systematic review.	BACKGROUND: Pain is the clinical hallmark of sickle cell disease (SCD) leading to hospitalization, psychological sequelae and a decreased health-related quality of life. The aim of this systematic literature review is to evaluate the efficacy of non-pharmacological interventions in reducing sickle cell related pain in children with SCD. METHODS: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines, a comprehensive literature search up until October 2022 was performed to identify studies that investigated the efficacy of non-pharmacological interventions on (1) pain frequency and/or intensity, and (2) analgesic and health service use in children with SCD until the age of 21. Both randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-experimental designed (QED) studies were considered for inclusion. RESULTS: Ten articles (five RCTs and five QED studies) with 422 participants were included. They investigated cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) (n = 5), biofeedback (n = 2), massage (n = 1), virtual reality (n = 1) and yoga (n = 1). The majority of the interventions were psychological (n = 7) and were performed in the outpatient clinic (n = 6). CBT and biofeedback significantly reduced frequency and/or intensity of SCD-related pain in outpatient settings, while virtual reality and yoga significantly reduced pain in inpatient settings. Biofeedback also significantly reduced analgesic use. None of the included articles reported reduced health service use. CONCLUSION: Non-pharmacological interventions may be effective in reducing pain in paediatric patients with SCD. However, due to the heterogeneity of the included studies a quantitative analysis could not be performed. Awaiting further supporting evidence, healthcare providers should consider implementing these interventions as valuable part of a comprehensive pain management strategy plan.
31960140	Hyperuricemia is associated with a lower glomerular filtration rate in pediatric sickle cell disease patients.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell nephropathy (SCN) is a progressive disease that contributes significant morbidity and mortality in sickle cell disease (SCD), yet it remains poorly understood. Hyperuricemia negatively impacts renal function in the non-sickle cell population but is understudied in SCD. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of the first 78 pediatric SCD patients enrolled in a cohort study. The mechanism of development of hyperuricemia (defined, serum uric acid (UA) >= 5.5 mg/dL) was characterized as a result of either UA overproduction or inefficient renal excretion by the Simkin index and fractional clearance of urate (FCU) equations. Associations between hyperuricemia and albuminuria or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were determined by linear regression. RESULTS: The prevalence of hyperuricemia in this young population (mean age 11.6 +- 3.77 years) was 34.2%. Only 1 hyperuricemic participant overproduced UA by Simkin index, while 62.5% were inefficient renal excretors of UA (FCU < 4%). Hyperuricemia was associated with a significant decrease in average eGFR, -27 ml/min/1.73m2 below normouricemia (mean eGFR 151.6 +- 40.32), p = 0.0122. Notably, the previously accepted association between decline of eGFR with age is significantly modified by hyperuricemia stratification, where hyperuricemia explains 44% of the variance in eGFR by age (R2 = 0.44, p = 0.0004) and is nonsignificant in normouricemia (R2 = 0.07, p = 0.0775). CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that hyperuricemia may be associated with early eGFR decline in SCN. This association must be further characterized in prospective cohort studies in SCN, and hyperuricemia must be investigated as a potential therapeutic target for SCN.
34487059	The Effects of Treatment with Blood Transfusion, Iron Chelation and Hydroxyurea on Puberty, Growth and Spermatogenesis in Sickle Cell Disease (SCD): A short update.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is traditionally associated with growth failure and delayed puberty. Wasting and stunting are still prevalent in children and adolescents with SCD, especially in developing countries. In addition, sperm abnormalities are frequent in males with SCD, with high rates of low sperm density, low sperm counts, poor motility, and increased abnormal morphology.  Severe anemia, vaso-occlusive attacks with ischemic injury to different organs including the pituitary gland and testis, and nutritional factors are incriminated in the pathogenesis of defective growth, puberty, and spermatogenesis. There is great phenotypic variability among patients with SCD. The variability in the clinical severity of SCA can partly be explained by genetic modifiers, including HbF level and co-inheritance of alpha-thalassemia. In the past, severe disease led to early mortality. Advancements in treatment have allowed patients with SCD to have a longer and better quality of life. For most patients, the mainstays of treatment are preventive and supportive. For those with severe SCD, three major therapeutic options are currently available: erythrocyte transfusion or exchange, hydroxyurea, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In this mini-review, the authors tried to recognize, delineate, and update knowledge on abnormalities due to SCD from those created by the use of different treatment modalities.

32446724	The Impact of Sickle Cell Anemia and Mental Health Diagnoses on Healthcare Use and Preventive Care among Children Enrolled in Medicaid, 2005-2012.	OBJECTIVE: To examine mental health diagnoses, healthcare use, and receipt of age-appropriate preventive care, including antibiotic prophylaxis, hydroxyurea therapy, and transcranial Doppler screenings, among children with sickle cell anemia (SCA). STUDY DESIGN: Children aged 1-17 years with SCA from 6 states having 3 or more Medicaid claims with a SCA diagnosis within a year (2005-2012) were included. Children with mental health diagnoses were identified with 1 or more mental health encounters. Poisson and logistic regression models with general estimating equations assessed the relationship between mental health diagnoses, healthcare use, and receipt of age-appropriate preventive care. RESULTS: In total, 7963 children with SCA were identified (22 424 person-years); 1593 person-years (7.1%) included 1 or more mental health diagnoses. Children with a mental health diagnosis were more likely to have inpatient admissions (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 1.46, 95% CI 1.36-1.56) and outpatient (IRR 1.27, 95% CI 1.21-1.34), emergency department (IRR 1.39, 95% CI 1.30-1.48), and well-child visits (IRR 1.19, 95% CI 1.11-1.29). Those with a mental health diagnosis were more likely to receive hydroxyurea therapy (odds ration [OR] 1.17, 95% CI 1.03-1.33) and less likely to receive transcranial Doppler screenings (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.68-0.93). CONCLUSIONS: Children with SCA do not receive adequate age-appropriate preventive care. Further research is necessary to identify key points of coordination between mental health and SCA services throughout the life course. This approach may help to increase receipt of age-appropriate preventive care and decrease reliance on acute care.
36964626	Serial prophylactic exchange blood transfusion in pregnant women with sickle cell disease (TAPS-2): statistical and qualitative analysis plan for a randomised controlled feasibility trial.	BACKGROUND: There are significant knowledge gaps regarding the effectiveness of serial prophylactic exchange blood transfusion (SPEBT) for pregnant women with sickle cell disease (SCD). The protocol for the randomised feasibility trial assessing SPEBT versus usual care in women with SCD (TAPS2 trial) has previously been published. This publication outlines the statistical and qualitative analysis plan for the study. METHODS AND DESIGN: TAPS2 is a randomised two-arm phase 2 feasibility trial with a nested qualitative study and health economic evaluation. Up to 50 pregnant women with SCD and a singleton pregnancy will be recruited and individually randomised to either SPEBT approximately every 6-10 weeks until delivery (intervention arm) or to usual care (control arm). Information will be collected on a range of feasibility and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Due to the impact of COVID-19 on study recruitment, the initial study period of 24 months was extended to 48 months. Other protocol updates designed to mitigate the impact of COVID-19-related disruption included allowing for remote consent and conducting all qualitative interviews by telephone. The primary outcome for the trial is the overall recruitment rate. The number of women screened, eligible, consented, randomised and withdrawn will be summarised as a CONSORT flow diagram. Differences in clinical outcomes will additionally be presented as an initial assessment of efficacy and to inform sample size calculations for a future definitive trial. Qualitative interviews with trial participants and clinicians will be analysed using reflexive thematic analysis; data from interviews with participants who declined to participate in the trial will be extracted and incorporated into summary tables to report key findings. The health economic analysis plan is not covered by this update. CONCLUSION: The publication of this analysis plan is designed to aid transparency and to reduce the potential for reporting bias. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NIH registry ( www. CLINICALTRIALS: gov ), registration number NCT03975894 (registered 05/06/19); ISRCTN ( www.isrctn.com ), registration number ISRCTN52684446 (retrospectively registered 02/08/19).
34535465	HbA1c performs well in monitoring glucose control even in populations with high prevalence of medical conditions that may alter its reliability: the OPTIMAL observational multicenter study.	INTRODUCTION: The utility of HbA1c (glycosylated hemoglobin) to estimate glycemic control in populations of African and other low-resource countries has been questioned because of high prevalence of other medical conditions that may affect its reliability. Using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), we aimed to determine the comparative performance of HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (within 5 hours of a meal) and random non-fasting glucose (RPG) in assessing glycemic burden. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We assessed the performance of HbA1c, FPG and RPG in comparison to CGM mean glucose in 192 Ugandan participants with type 2 diabetes. Analysis was undertaken in all participants, and in subgroups with and without medical conditions reported to affect HbA1c reliability. We then assessed the performance of FPG and RPG, and optimal thresholds, in comparison to HbA1c in participants without medical conditions thought to alter HbA1c reliability. RESULTS: 32.8% (63/192) of participants had medical conditions that may affect HbA1c reliability: anemia 9.4% (18/192), sickle cell trait and/or hemoglobin C (HbC) 22.4% (43/192), or renal impairment 6.3% (12/192). Despite high prevalence of medical conditions thought to affect HbA1c reliability, HbA1c had the strongest correlation with CGM measured glucose in day-to-day living (0.88, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.91), followed by FPG (0.82, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.86) and RPG (0.76, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.81). Among participants without conditions thought to affect HbA1c reliability, FPG and RPG had a similar diagnostic performance in identifying poor glycemic control defined by a range of HbA1c thresholds. FPG of >=7.1 mmol/L and RPG of >=10.5 mmol/L correctly identified 78.2% and 78.8%, respectively, of patients with an HbA1c of >=7.0%. CONCLUSIONS: HbA1c is the optimal test for monitoring glucose control even in low-income and middle-income countries where medical conditions that may alter its reliability are prevalent; FPG and RPG are valuable alternatives where HbA1c is not available.
34407676	Progression of central nervous system disease from pediatric to young adulthood in sickle cell anemia.	Silent cerebral infarcts and arteriopathy are common and progressive in individuals with sickle cell anemia. However, most data describing brain lesions in sickle cell anemia are cross-sectional or derive from pediatric cohorts with short follow-up. We investigated the progression of silent cerebral infarct and cerebral vessel stenosis on brain MRI and MRA, respectively, by describing the incidence of new or worsening lesions over a period of up to 25 years among young adults with sickle cell anemia and explored risk factors for progression. Forty-four adults with sickle cell anemia (HbSS or HbSbeta0thalassemia), exposed to chronic transfusions (n = 12) or hydroxyurea (n = 32), median age 19.2 years (range 18.0-31.5), received a screening brain MRI/MRA and their results were compared with a clinical exam performed during childhood and adolescence. We used exact log-rank test to compare MRI and MRA progression among any two groups. The hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated from Cox regression analyses. Progression of MRI and MRA occurred in 12 (27%) and 4 (9%) young adults, respectively, relative to their pediatric exams. MRI progression risk was high among participants with abnormal pediatric exams (HR: 11.6, 95% CI: 2.5-54.7) and conditional or abnormal transcranial Doppler ultrasound velocities (HR: 3.9, 95% CI: 1.0-15.1). Among individuals treated with hydroxyurea, high fetal hemoglobin measured in childhood was associated with lower hazard of MRI progression (HR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.76-0.98). MRA progression occurred more frequently among those with prior stroke (HR: 8.6, 95% CI: 1.2-64), abnormal pediatric exam (P = 0.00084), and elevated transcranial Doppler ultrasound velocities (P = 0.004). Brain MRI/MRA imaging in pediatrics can identify high-risk patients for CNS disease progression in young adulthood, prompting consideration for early aggressive treatments.
38069073	Drug Selection and Posology, Optimal Therapies and Risk/Benefit Assessment in Medicine: The Paradigm of Iron-Chelating Drugs.	The design of clinical protocols and the selection of drugs with appropriate posology are critical parameters for therapeutic outcomes. Optimal therapeutic protocols could ideally be designed in all diseases including for millions of patients affected by excess iron deposition (EID) toxicity based on personalised medicine parameters, as well as many variations and limitations. EID is an adverse prognostic factor for all diseases and especially for millions of chronically red-blood-cell-transfused patients. Differences in iron chelation therapy posology cause disappointing results in neurodegenerative diseases at low doses, but lifesaving outcomes in thalassemia major (TM) when using higher doses. In particular, the transformation of TM from a fatal to a chronic disease has been achieved using effective doses of oral deferiprone (L1), which improved compliance and cleared excess toxic iron from the heart associated with increased mortality in TM. Furthermore, effective L1 and L1/deferoxamine combination posology resulted in the complete elimination of EID and the maintenance of normal iron store levels in TM. The selection of effective chelation protocols has been monitored by MRI T2* diagnosis for EID levels in different organs. Millions of other iron-loaded patients with sickle cell anemia, myelodysplasia and haemopoietic stem cell transplantation, or non-iron-loaded categories with EID in different organs could also benefit from such chelation therapy advances. Drawbacks of chelation therapy include drug toxicity in some patients and also the wide use of suboptimal chelation protocols, resulting in ineffective therapies. Drug metabolic effects, and interactions with other metals, drugs and dietary molecules also affected iron chelation therapy. Drug selection and the identification of effective or optimal dose protocols are essential for positive therapeutic outcomes in the use of chelating drugs in TM and other iron-loaded and non-iron-loaded conditions, as well as general iron toxicity.
37736809	Evaluating Consistency of Documented ICD Codes for Hospitalized Patients With Sickle Cell Disease.	OBJECTIVES: Conducting health services research relies on consistent diagnosis code documentation; however, it is unknown if consistent documentation in claims data occurs among patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and/or trait (SCT). The objective of this study was to examine the consistency of International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code documentation for SCD/SCT and identify coding discrepancies between patients' hospitalizations. PATIENTS: A total of 80 031 hospitalization records across 528 hospitals belonging to 15 380 unique patients who had at least 1 documentation of SCD/SCT and 2 or more hospitalizations during the study period (April 2015-December 2016). METHODS: Secondary analysis of patient discharge abstracts in California, Florida, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. ICD 9 and ICD 10 codes identified patients with SCD/SCT. Variations in documentation consistency across hospitals were examined. RESULTS: Only 51% of patients were consistently documented. There were statistically significant differences in whether a patient was or was not consistently documented based on: age, race/ethnicity, sex, insurer, and disease type. Twenty-five percent of hospitalization records were not consistently documented with an SCD code. Hospitalization records, for patients not consistently documented (49%), often included primary admitting diagnoses for conditions associated with SCD. Few hospitals (18%) were above average in consistently documenting SCD/SCT. CONCLUSIONS: Not consistent documentation for SCD/SCT occurs with variation among patients and across disease type and hospitals. These findings signal to researchers the importance of thoroughly identifying all hospitalizations when studying populations with chronic disease. Without accurate documentation, research relying on claims data may produce inaccurate findings.
35671012	Do racial and ethnic disparities lead to the undertreatment of pain? Are there solutions?	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The current review aims to empower anesthesiologists, specifically pain medicine specialists, to become leaders in ensuring equitable care. RECENT FINDINGS: Disparities in both acute and chronic pain medicine lead to increased morbidity for patients of color. Gaps in care include misdiagnosis or under diagnosis of chronic pain disease states, undertreatment of sickle cell disease and other conditions that are common in minorities, under prescription of opioids, and lack of access to novel opioid sparing treatments. While the causes of these disparities are multifactorial, care team implicit bias and lack of representation are two of the major factors. Solutions are challenging, but the authors suggest an inside out solution. We believe that this practice will have far-reaching downstream effects, including improving diversity in our field and quality of care for our patients. SUMMARY: The current article reviews disparities in both acute and chronic pain treatment for underrepresented racial and ethnic minorities in the United States. The authors examine whether implicit bias and lack of representation are a contributing factor for these disparities. Lastly, we will discuss potential solutions.
32928463	Emergency Department Utilization for Patients Living With Sickle Cell Disease: Psychosocial Predictors of Health Care Behaviors.	STUDY OBJECTIVE: Individuals living with sickle cell disease (SCD) often require urgent care; however, some patients hesitate to present to the emergency department (ED), which may increase the risk of serious clinical complications. Our study aims to examine psychosocial, clinical, and demographic factors associated with delaying ED care. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of 267 adults with SCD from the national INSIGHTS Study. The binary outcome variable asked whether, in the past 12 months, participants had delayed going to an ED when they thought they needed care. Logistic regression was performed with clinical, demographic, and psychosocial measures. RESULTS: Approximately 67% of the participants reported delaying ED care. Individuals who delayed care were more likely to have reported higher stigma experiences (odds ratio [OR]=1.09; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03 to 1.16), more frequent pain episodes (OR=1.15; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.32), lower health care satisfaction (OR= 0.74; 95% CI 0.59 to 0.94), and more frequent ED visits (OR=6.07; 95% CI 1.18 to 31.19). Disease severity and demographics, including sex, age, and health insurance status, were not significantly associated with delay in care. CONCLUSION: Psychosocial factors, including disease stigma and previous negative health care experiences, are associated with delay of ED care in this SCD cohort. There is a need to further investigate the influence of psychosocial factors on the health care-seeking behaviors of SCD patients, as well as the downstream consequences of these behaviors on morbidity and mortality. The resulting knowledge can contribute to efforts to improve health care experiences and patient-provider relationships in the SCD community.
38049241	Les anemies aigues et la strategie transfusionnelle chez les drepanocytaires adultes: Acute anemias transfusion strategy in adult sickle cell patients.	Worsening of anemia is very common in sickle cell disease. It is important to investigate specific complications related to sickle cell disease but also other causes of anemia in general. Transfusions or exchange transfusions are major therapeutic options and are frequently used for acute complications of sickle cell disease but also for primary and secondary prevention of some of the chronic complications. The transfusion strategy has been modified since the awareness of post-transfusion hemolysis by taking into account the transfusion risk score. A strong collaboration between the patient's expert center, the Blood center and the patient's hospitalization unit is required to make decisions.   2023 Societe nationale francaise de medecine interne (SNFMI).

32360095	ABO blood group should be considered and reported when red blood cell exchange transfusion is used to treat Plasmodiumfalciparum Malaria patients.	Laboratory and epidemiologic studies have clarified how persons born with malaria-resistant red blood cells (RBCs)-like group-O, sickle-trait, and C-trait RBCs-are protected against death or severe disease due to Plasmodiumfalciparum (Pf) infection. Compared to malaria-promoting RBCs-like non-O or hemoglobin-AA RBCs-inborn RBC protection against severe Pf malaria can be profound: up to 10-fold greater. Given that "the Berlin patient" success showed patients do not have to be born with disease-resistant cells to benefit from them, why have the biologically plausible benefits of exchange transfusion (ET) of malaria-resistant RBCs not yet been evaluated? Unfortunately, a 2013 ET-for-malaria meta-analysis could not quantify the impact on mortality of ET of malaria-resistant RBCs because RBC malaria resistance variables (ABO group, hemoglobin type, enzyme levels, etc.) had not been reported in any of the ET studies used in that meta-analysis. To promote evaluation of the therapeutic impact of specific malaria-resistant RBCs, we urge clinicians to always report ABO blood group (and all other RBC malaria-resistance variables they are aware of) when they use ET to rescue Pf-infected patients. Prudent selection of donor RBCs has successfully optimized ET for sickle cell disease patients, and this precedent suggests selection of special malaria-resistant donor RBCs may optimize ET for Pf-malaria patients. Given that ET is used worldwide as a rescue adjunct, we feel it is most prudent to now assume-until proven otherwise-that considering and reporting the Pf-malaria-resistance variables of the RBCs to be transfused-at least ABO status-will help optimize ET-for-malaria.
37057367	Desire for biological parenthood and patient counseling on the risk of infertility among adolescents and adults with hemoglobinopathies.	BACKGROUND: Both diagnosis and treatment of hemoglobinopathies have been associated with an increased risk of fertility impairment. German guidelines recommend annual monitoring of fertility parameters to enable early detection of fertility impairment and/or to offer fertility preservation (FP) when indicated. We explored the general desire for parenthood, the frequency of recalling fertility counseling and testing, and the utilization of FP in adolescents and adults with hemoglobinopathies. PROCEDURE: In a cross-sectional study, patients aged 12-50 years, treated in Germany, Austria, or Switzerland, were surveyed on fertility-related aspects. Medical data, including fertility testing results, were collected from patient records. RESULTS: Overall, 116/121 eligible patients, diagnosed with sickle cell disease (70.7%), thalassemia (27.6%), or other hemoglobinopathy (1.7%), participated in our study (57.8% female, median age 17.0 years, range 12-50 years). All participants required treatment of the underlying hemoglobinopathy: 68.1% received hydroxyurea, 25.9% required regular blood transfusions, and 6.0% underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Most patients (82/108, 75.9%) stated a considerable to strong desire for (future) parenthood, independent of sex, education, diagnosis, or subjective health status. Fertility counseling was only recalled by 32/111 patients (28.8%) and least frequently by younger patients (12-16 years) or those treated with regular blood transfusions or hydroxyurea. While fertility testing was documented for 59.5% (69/116) in medical records, only 11.6% (13/112) recalled previous assessments. FP was only used by 5.4% (6/111) of patients. CONCLUSION: Most patients with hemoglobinopathies wish to have biological children, yet only few recalled fertility counseling and testing. Adequate patient counseling should be offered to all patients at risk for infertility.
33307945	Hemoglobin Target and Transfusion Modality for Adult Patients With Sickle Cell Disease Acute Chest Syndrome.	BACKGROUND: Despite the importance of transfusion in treating sickle cell disease acute chest syndrome, the target hemoglobin and optimal modality for transfusion remain unknown. OBJECTIVES: To compare hospital length of stay (LOS) in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with acute chest syndrome transfused to hemoglobin >= 8 g/dL versus patients transfused to hemoglobin < 8 g/dL; and to compare hospital LOS in acute chest syndrome patients treated with and without exchange transfusion. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of all acute chest syndrome patients treated in the medical ICU at 2 tertiary care hospitals between January 2011 and August 2016 (n = 82). We compared median hospital LOS in patients transfused to hemoglobin >= 8 g/dL by the time of ICU transfer to the medical floor versus patients transfused to hemoglobin < 8 g/dL as well as patients who received exchange transfusion versus no exchange transfusion using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. We modeled the association between hospital LOS and hemoglobin at ICU transfer to the medical floor using multivariable log-linear regression. RESULTS: Median hospital LOS was about half as long for patients transfused to hemoglobin >= 8 g/dL versus hemoglobin < 8 g/dL (8.0 versus 16.5 days, P = 0.008). There was no difference in LOS for patients treated with and without exchange transfusion. On average, a 1 g/dL increase in hemoglobin was associated with a 19.5% decrease (95% CI 10.8-28.2%) in LOS, controlling for possible confounding factors. CONCLUSIONS: Transfusion to a hemoglobin target >= 8 g/dL is associated with decreased hospital LOS in patients with acute chest syndrome. There was no difference in LOS between patients who received exchange transfusion and those who did not.
33892094	A pilot study of the acceptability, feasibility and safety of yoga for chronic pain in sickle cell disease.	OBJECTIVES: To determine the acceptability, feasibility and safety of yoga for chronic pain in sickle cell disease. DESIGN AND SETTING: In Part A of this two-part study, adolescents with SCD and chronic pain (Group 1) and their parent (Group 2) completed a survey designed to capture pain characteristics, attitudes and practices related to yoga, and potential acceptability of a yoga program. In Part B, the study assessed the feasibility and safety of an instructor-led group yoga program. The study was registered on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03694548). INTERVENTION: Eight instructor-led group yoga sessions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Feasibility and safety outcomes were chosen a priori, as follows: 1) Proportion of adolescent patients with SCD and chronic pain approached that consent to participate in Part A, 2) Proportion of adolescent participants enrolled in Part A that consent to participate in Part B, 3) Proportion of participants enrolled in Part B that attend at least 6 of 8 yoga sessions, 4) Proportion of participants enrolled in Part B with an ED visit or a hospitalization for pain within 24 h of completion of each yoga session, 5) Proportion of participants in Part B who complete all study assessments before, and at the end of the yoga program, 6) Adherence to submission of pain diary. RESULTS: The median age of 15 patient participants in Part A was 16 (IQR 14-17), and 14 parents was 43.5 (IQR 42-51). Most participants were female. Most participant responses indicated a positive opinion of yoga. Nine adolescents (60 %) from Part A participated in Part B of the study. The median age of 9 participants in Part B was 17 (IQR 15-18), and 5 of the 9 participants were female (53.3 %). Only one participant was able to attend 3 of the 8 yoga sessions offered, and did not experience any ED visits or hospitalizations following the yoga sessions. None of the other feasibility endpoints were met in this study. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with SCD and chronic pain overall have a positive opinion of yoga, but there are challenges with recruitment and retention of participants in a clinical trial of yoga, and barriers to feasibility of an in-person group yoga intervention.
34968422	Accurate long-read sequencing allows assembly of the duplicated RHD and RHCE genes harboring variants relevant to blood transfusion.	Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have transformed medical genetics. However, short-read lengths pose a limitation on identification of structural variants, sequencing repetitive regions, phasing of distant nucleotide changes, and distinguishing highly homologous genomic regions. Long-read sequencing technologies may offer improvements in the characterization of genes that are currently difficult to assess. We used a combination of targeted DNA capture, long-read sequencing, and a customized bioinformatics pipeline to fully assemble the RH region, which harbors variation relevant to red cell donor-recipient mismatch, particularly among patients with sickle cell disease. RHD and RHCE are a pair of duplicated genes located within an ~175 kb region on human chromosome 1 that have high sequence similarity and frequent structural variations. To achieve the assembly, we utilized palindrome repeats in PacBio SMRT reads to obtain consensus sequences of 2.1 to 2.9 kb average length with over 99% accuracy. We used these long consensus sequences to identify 771 assembly markers and to phase the RHD-RHCE region with high confidence. The dataset enabled direct linkage between coding and intronic variants, phasing of distant SNPs to determine RHD-RHCE haplotypes, and identification of known and novel structural variations along with the breakpoints. A limiting factor in phasing is the frequency of heterozygous assembly markers and therefore was most successful in samples from African Black individuals with increased heterogeneity at the RH locus. Overall, this approach allows RH genotyping and de novo assembly in an unbiased and comprehensive manner that is necessary to expand application of NGS technology to high-resolution RH typing.
32147045	Acupuncture for pain management in children with sickle cell disease.	Pain associated with sickle cell disease (SCD) is frequently treated with opioids which have many side effects. There is a need for adjuvant non-opioid therapies that can improve pain control. Acupuncture, an integrative approach, has been shown to be useful in non-SCD pain conditions but has been used to a very limited extent in SCD. In this report we present a single academic pediatric center experience showing acceptability, feasibility and improved pain experience with adjuvant acupuncture therapy in children with SCD and suggest that acupuncture should be explored as a treatment option for managing pain in SCD.
33514718	Cas9-AAV6 gene correction of beta-globin in autologous HSCs improves sickle cell disease erythropoiesis in mice.	CRISPR/Cas9-mediated beta-globin (HBB) gene correction of sickle cell disease (SCD) patient-derived hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in combination with autologous transplantation represents a recent paradigm in gene therapy. Although several Cas9-based HBB-correction approaches have been proposed, functional correction of in vivo erythropoiesis has not been investigated previously. Here, we use a humanized globin-cluster SCD mouse model to study Cas9-AAV6-mediated HBB-correction in functional HSCs within the context of autologous transplantation. We discover that long-term multipotent HSCs can be gene corrected ex vivo and stable hemoglobin-A production can be achieved in vivo from HBB-corrected HSCs following autologous transplantation. We observe a direct correlation between increased HBB-corrected myeloid chimerism and normalized in vivo red blood cell (RBC) features, but even low levels of chimerism resulted in robust hemoglobin-A levels. Moreover, this study offers a platform for gene editing of mouse HSCs for both basic and translational research.
35485519	Rare emergency in children: Priapism and stepwise treatment approach.	BACKGROUND: Priapism is a rare condition in children and the treatment algorithm is controversial in this age group. Herein, we report eight cases with low-flow priapism and our stepwise treatment approach in light of literature. METHODS: We present a simple stepwise treatment for low-flow priapism including five steps. Step 1: Cold compress and analgesia while evaluation the priapism and its etiology. Step 2: Corporal aspiration and adrenaline infusion in the ward. Step 3: Modified Winter shunt in the same place. Step 4: Ketamine application and caudal block in the operating room. Step 5: Sapheno-cavernous (Grayhack) shunt. Eight cases with low-flow priapism were reviewed retrospectively. Symptoms, duration of tumescence, the interventions, and step that provide detumescence were recorded. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 8.5 years (1-17 y). The median time of the priapism before admission was 15 h (4-165 h). The etiological factors were sickle cell disease, hemodialysis due to chronic renal failure, and factor V Leiden mutation in three patients. Detumescence was achieved in one patient at Step 2, in two patients at Steps 3, 4, and 5, respectively. Rigidity of cavernous body was observed in one patient in long-term follow-up. CONCLUSION: Low-flow priapism is a urological emergency that may cause erectile dysfunction. Treatment options should be selected according to a protocol that prevents time loss and avoids more invasive treatment in unnecessary situations. Our algorithm with simple nature and its steps from less invasive to more invasive procedures may be an alternative for the treatment of low-flow priapism.
37059617	[Lung manifestations of sickle-cell disease].	Sickle-cell disease is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder of hemoglobin that causes systemic damage. Hypoxia is the main actor of sickle-cell disease. It initiates acutely the pathogenic cascade leading to tissue damages that in turn induce chronic hypoxia. Lung lesions represent the major risk of morbidity and mortality. Management of sickle-cell disease requires a tight collaboration between hematologists, intensivists and chest physicians. Recurrent episodes of thrombosis and hemolysis characterize the disease. New therapeutic protocols, associating hydroxyurea, transfusion program and stem cell transplantation in severe cases allow a prolonged survival until the fifth decade. However, recurrent pain, crisis, frequent hospital admissions due to infection, anemia or acute chest syndrome and chronic complications leading to organ deficiencies degrade the patients' quality of life. In low-income countries where the majority of sickle-cell patients are living, the disease is still associated with a high mortality in childhood. This paper focuses on acute chest syndrome and chronic lung manifestations.
32767846	Process mapping of the urgent red cell exchange procedure for patients with severe complications of sickle cell disease at a centralized hemapheresis service.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) patients require urgent red cell exchange (RCE) procedures for acute chest syndrome (ACS), demanding a coordinated effort of multiple clinical services. Execution of RCE is a multistep process from the time the procedure is requested to the time the procedure is initiated. A retrospective review of patients with SCD requiring urgent RCE for ACS and stroke from 2012 to 2017 was performed at a centralized hemapheresis service covering a multihospital healthcare system. A total of 30 urgent RCE procedures performed on 28 patients were evaluated. The time required for red blood cell (RBC) preparation was the longest step in the process (median 3.8 hours). Furthermore, RBC preparation time was longer for sickle cell patients with RBC alloimmunization compared with nonalloimmunized patients (8.6 vs 3.8 hours, P = .03). One mortality event occurred in Ab- group. This study identified potentially modifiable factors, which impact the time to implementation of RCE in one service area. It highlights the importance of a structured and coordinated approach for the efficient and timely delivery of this vital treatment modality.
31882437	Indications for RBC Exchange Transfusion in Patients with Sickle Cell Disease: Revisited.	Clinically, sickle cell disease (SCD) is characterized by chronic hemolytic anemia, recurrent acute vaso-occlusive crises, and progressive multi-organ failure. The management for SCD varies greatly among patients, and in the same patient longitudinally. Some patients may benefit from minimal therapy and infrequent transfusions, while others are transfusion dependent. Transfusion therapy can consist of simple transfusions, which often lead to iron overload and require iron chelation therapy. Simple transfusion, however, cannot reduce HbS levels rapidly, which may be required in certain critical conditions such as acute chest syndrome (ACS) or stroke. On the other hand, red blood cell exchange transfusion (RBCEX) can prevent iron overload and achieve rapid HbS reduction. In RBCEX, the red blood cells (RBCs) of the patient are replaced with normal RBCs, and the removed plasma is returned to the patient with minimal alteration. Plasma of patients with SCD is known to contain increased levels of several inflammatory mediators in the steady state that increase during crises. This finding explains why some patients with severe complications do not respond to RBCEX, but do much better after using plasma exchange in addition to RBCEX, as previously reported. Based on this, a revision of the indications for RBCEX in patents with SCD is recommended. DISCUSSION: In the 1980s and 1990s we used the Haemonetics Corporation's V-50 machine to perform intermittent whole blood (WB) exchange to treat severe complications of sickle cell disease (SCD.) The results were excellent, as previously described [1].
32890079	Timing of Alemtuzumab With Respect to Day of Bone Marrow Infusion and its Effects Upon Engraftment and Graft-Versus-Host Disease in Patients With Sickle Cell Disease: A Single-Institutional Study.	The possible impact of "late" alemtuzumab (administered on days -10 to -8) versus "early" alemtuzumab (-19 to -17) with respect to engraftment and acute/chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) in a group of 25 pediatric patients with sickle cell disease undergoing bone marrow transplantation following conditioning with alemtuzumab, fludarabine, and melphalan is reported. The first 9 patients received "late" alemtuzumab followed by bone marrow transplantation from HLA-matched sibling donors. The next 16 patients undergoing matched sibling transplants received "early" alemtuzumab. In the "late" group, 1 patient (11%) developed acute GvHD. Six patients (67%) achieved sustained engraftment. Three patients (33%) experienced graft rejection, leading to termination of enrollment of patients on this regimen. In the "early" alemtuzumab group, acute and chronic GvHD developed in 43% and 25% patients, respectively. None of the patients experienced graft rejection in this group of patients. Three patients developed stable mixed chimerism and 13 patients demonstrated 100% donor chimerism at 1 year post-transplant and beyond. These results suggest a benefit with respect to engraftment of administering "early" versus "late" alemtuzumab in this reduced-intensity conditioning regimen, however, with the possible cost of an increase in acute, and possibly chronic GvHD.
38418772	Apadamtase Alfa: First Approval.	Apadamtase alfa (ADAMTS13, recombinant-krhn; ADZYNMA), a human recombinant form of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 13 (ADAMTS13), is being developed by Takeda under license from KM biologics for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and sickle cell disease. On 9 November 2023, apadamtase alfa was approved in the USA for prophylactic and on-demand enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in paediatric and adult patients with congenital TTP. Apadamtase alfa is under regulatory review for congenital TTP in the EU and Japan, and is under clinical development for immune-mediated TTP in several countries worldwide. Clinical development of apadamtase alfa for vaso-occlusive crisis related to sickle cell anaemia is underway in the USA. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of apadamtase alfa leading to this first approval in the USA for congenital TTP.
33830027	Systematic Review/Meta-Analysis on Efficacy of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation in Sickle Cell Disease: An International Effort on Behalf of the Pediatric Diseases Working Party of European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation and the Sickle Cell Transplantation International Consortium.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) affects more than 300,000 children annually worldwide. Despite improved supportive care, long-term prognosis remains poor. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is the sole validated curative option, resulting in sustained resolution of the clinical phenotype. The medical literature on allo-HCT for SCD is largely limited to children. Recent studies have evaluated allo-HCT efficacy in adults. Here, we conducted a systematic review/meta-analysis to assess the totality of evidence on the efficacy, or lack thereof, of allo-HCT in treating SCD. We performed a comprehensive literature search using PubMed/Medline, Embase, and Cochrane library databases on November 13, 2019. Four authors independently extracted data on clinical outcomes related to benefits (overall survival [OS] and disease-free survival [DFS]) and harms (acute graft-versus-host disease [aGVHD], chronic graft-versus-host disease [cGVHD], nonrelapse mortality [NRM], and graft failure [GF]). Our search identified a total of 1906 references. Only 33 studies (n= 2853 patients) met our inclusion criteria. We also performed a subset analysis by age. Analyses of all-age groups showed pooled rates of 96% for OS, 90% for DFS, 20% for aGVHD, 10% for cGVHD, 4% for NRM, and 5% for GF. In the pediatric population, pooled rates for OS, DFS, aGVHD, cGVHD, NRM, and GF were 97%, 91%, 26%, 11%, 5%, and 3%, respectively. In adults, pooled rates for OS, DFS, aGVHD, cGVHD, NRM, and GF were 98%, 90%, 7%, 1%, 0%, and 14%, respectively. Our data show that allo-HCT is safe and effective, yielding pooled OS rates exceeding 90%. The high GF rate of 14% in adults is concerning and emphasizes the need to evaluate new strategies.
31684693	Regular long-term red blood cell transfusions for managing chronic chest complications in sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease is a genetic haemoglobin disorder, which can cause severe pain, significant end-organ damage, pulmonary complications, and premature death. Sickle cell disease is one of the most common severe monogenic disorders in the world, due to the inheritance of two abnormal haemoglobin (beta globin) genes. The two most common chronic chest complications due to sickle cell disease are pulmonary hypertension and chronic sickle lung disease. These complications can lead to morbidity (such as reduced exercise tolerance) and increased mortality. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2011 and updated in 2014 and 2016. OBJECTIVES: We wanted to determine whether trials involving people with sickle cell disease that compare regular long-term blood transfusion regimens with standard care, hydroxycarbamide (hydroxyurea) any other drug treatment show differences in the following: mortality associated with chronic chest complications; severity of established chronic chest complications; development and progression of chronic chest complications; serious adverse events. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register. Date of the last search: 19 September 2019. We also searched for randomised controlled trials in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library, Issue 10, 14 November 2018), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), CINAHL (from 1937), the Transfusion Evidence Library (from 1950), and ongoing trial databases to 14 November 2018. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials of people of any age with one of four common sickle cell disease genotypes, i.e. Hb SS, Sbetao, SC, or Sbeta+ that compared regular red blood cell transfusion regimens (either simple or exchange transfusions) to hydroxycarbamide, any other drug treatment, or to standard care that were aimed at reducing the development or progression of chronic chest complications (chronic sickle lung and pulmonary hypertension). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. MAIN RESULTS: No studies matching the selection criteria were found. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for randomised controlled trials looking at the role of long-term transfusion therapy in pulmonary hypertension and chronic sickle lung disease. Due to the chronic nature of the conditions, such trials should aim to use a combination of objective and subjective measures to assess participants repeatedly before and after the intervention.
32259777	Bridging the Gap Among Clinical Practice Guidelines for Pain Management in Cancer and Sickle Cell Disease.	Opioids are a critical component of pain relief strategies for the management of patients with cancer and sickle cell disease. The escalation of opioid addiction and overdose in the United States has led to increased scrutiny of opioid prescribing practices. Multiple reports have revealed that regulatory and coverage policies, intended to curb inappropriate opioid use, have created significant barriers for many patients. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Comprehensive Cancer Network, and American Society of Clinical Oncology each publish clinical practice guidelines for the management of chronic pain. A recent JAMA Oncology article highlighted perceived variability in recommendations among these guidelines. In response, leadership from guideline organizations, government representatives, and authors of the original article met to discuss challenges and solutions. The meeting featured remarks by the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, presentations on each clinical practice guideline, an overview of the pain management needs of patients with sickle cell disease, an overview of perceived differences among guidelines, and a discussion of differences and commonalities among the guidelines. The meeting revealed that although each guideline varies in the intended patient population, target audience, and methodology, there is no disagreement among recommendations when applied to the appropriate patient and clinical situation. It was determined that clarification and education are needed regarding the intent, patient population, and scope of each clinical practice guideline, rather than harmonization of guideline recommendations. Clinical practice guidelines can serve as a resource for policymakers and payers to inform policy and coverage determinations.
38000347	Generation of two isogenic sickle cell disease induced pluripotent stem cell lines from testicular fibroblasts.	Curative bone marrow transplantation (BMT) therapies for sickle cell disease (SCD) can cause infertility. The Fertility Preservation Program (FPP) in Pittsburgh cryopreserves testicular tissues for SCD patients prior to BMT in anticipation that those tissues can be thawed in the future and matured to produce sperm. Here, we generated and validated two isogenic patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from testicular biopsy fibroblasts of a 12-year-old SCD patient.

38506770	Ex vivo culture resting time impacts transplantation outcomes of genome-edited human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in xenograft mouse models.	Ex vivo resting culture is a standard procedure following genome editing in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). However, prolonged culture may critically affect cell viability and stem cell function. We investigated whether varying durations of culture resting times impact the engraftment efficiency of human CD34+ HSPCs edited at the BCL11A enhancer, a key regulator in the expression of fetal hemoglobin. We employed electroporation to introduce CRISPR-Cas9 components for BCL11A enhancer editing and compared outcomes with nonelectroporated (NEP) and electroporated-only (EP) control groups. Post-electroporation, we monitored cell viability, death rates, and the frequency of enriched hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) fractions (CD34+CD90+CD45RA- cells) over a 48-hour period. Our findings reveal that while the NEP group showed an increase in cell numbers 24 hours post-electroporation, both EP and BCL11A-edited groups experienced significant cell loss. Although CD34+ cell frequency remained high in all groups for up to 48 hours post-electroporation, the frequency of the HSC-enriched fraction was significantly lower in the EP and edited groups compared to the NEP group. In NBSGW xenograft mouse models, both conditioned with busulfan and nonconditioned, we found that immediate transplantation post-electroporation led to enhanced engraftment without compromising editing efficiency. Human glycophorin A+ (GPA+) red blood cells (RBCs) sorted from bone marrow of all BCL11A edited mice exhibited similar levels of gamma-globin expression, regardless of infusion time. Our findings underscore the critical importance of optimizing the culture duration between genome editing and transplantation. Minimizing this interval may significantly enhance engraftment success and minimize cell loss without compromising editing efficiency. These insights offer a pathway to improve the success rates of genome editing in HSPCs, particularly for conditions like sickle cell disease.

38669382	Management of diabetes mellitus patients with sickle cell anemia: Challenges and therapeutic approaches.	The coexistence of diabetes mellitus (DM) and sickle cell anemia (SCA) poses significant challenges in clinical management due to the complex interactions and overlapping complications associated with both conditions. Managing diabetes in individuals with SCA requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique physiological and pathological aspects of both diseases. This paper reviews the challenges encountered in the management of DM in patients with SCA and explores therapeutic strategies and approaches to optimize patient care. Challenges in the management of DM in individuals with SCA stem from several factors, including the impact of hemoglobin variants on glycemic control assessment, increased susceptibility to infections, altered immune response, and complications associated with both diseases. Moreover, the coexistence of SCA and DM heightens the susceptibility to infections due to compromised immune function, emphasizing the need for vigilant preventive measures, including vaccinations and close monitoring for infectious complications. Close collaboration among healthcare providers specializing in diabetes, hematology, and other relevant fields is crucial for developing comprehensive care plans. Individualized treatment strategies that balance glycemic control, pain management, and preventive care are essential to mitigate complications and optimize the overall health outcomes of patients with both DM and SCA. In conclusion, managing diabetes in the context of SCA necessitates a nuanced and patient-centered approach. By addressing the challenges and employing tailored therapeutic strategies, healthcare providers can improve the quality of life and health outcomes for individuals affected by both conditions.
32740518	The Liver in Sickle Cell Disease.	ABSTRACT: Liver involvement is found in nearly 40% of children with sickle cell disease. The most frequent complication is cholelithiasis. The most severe complication is acute hepatic crisis, with symptoms ranging from increasing jaundice to multiple organ failure and death. The emergency and mostly efficient treatment is exchange transfusion. Chronic cholangiopathy is increasingly recognized, with autoimmune features in most cases, worsened by chronic ischemia. Transfusion-related iron overload is not yet a concern in children, and hepatotoxicity of iron chelators is rare. We propose recommendations to prevent, explore, and treat these complications. We emphasize the close collaboration required between hepatologists and specialists of sickle cell disease.

We previously conducted a single-arm feasibility study (STRIDE1) of myeloablative bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in adolescents and young adults with sickle cell disease (SCD). The trial identified donors before entry, enrolled well, and found no unexpected regimen-related toxicity. Although many single-arm studies have been published, there are no controlled trials of either BMT or gene therapy in SCD. Therefore, we designed a comparative trial by biological assignment (available donor versus no donor). This multicenter National Institutes of Health-funded study (Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network 1503; STRIDE2) enrolled patients between 2016 and 2021 at 35 sites. Lagging recruitment led to study closure, and here we report the impediments to accrual. The BMT regimen and entry criteria were from STRIDE1, and 2-year survival was the primary endpoint. To minimize selection bias from prior HLA typing, STRIDE2 excluded individuals with previously identified donors. Accrual was stopped at 69% of target (138 enrolled; assigned 28 with donor, 96 with no donor). Barriers to enrollment included lower than expected frequency of HLA-matched related and unrelated donors; loss of enrollees owing to previously identified donors; conventional care arm dissuading some seeking BMT; challenging short-term endpoints in SCD, including incomplete documentation of sickle pain episodes; state Medicaid (primary insurers of SCD) denial of BMT coverage for adult SCD despite the study having secured Coverage with Evidence Development from the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services; slowed accrual in 2019 to 2021 during the Coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic; and restriction of BMT resourcing for nonmalignant diseases by academic medical (cancer) centers. Social obstacles and access to BMT centers also limited entry, as did practitioner and participant concerns over suitability, cost, and toxicity. Planning for future controlled trials of curative therapy in SCD and other nonmalignant diseases likely will meet these enrollment challenges. Lessons from this trial may aid the development of future comparative studies.
38289184	RH genotypes and red cell alloimmunization rates in chronically transfused patients with sickle cell disease: A multisite study in the USA.	BACKGROUND: Red cell alloimmunization remains a challenge for individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD) and contributes to increased risk of hemolytic transfusion reactions and associated comorbidities. Despite prophylactic serological matching for ABO, Rh, and K, red cell alloimmunization persists, in part, due to a high frequency of variant RH alleles in patients with SCD and Black blood donors. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We compared RH genotypes and rates of alloimmunization in 342 pediatric and young adult patients with SCD on chronic transfusion therapy exposed to >90,000 red cell units at five sites across the USA. Genotyping was performed with RHD and RHCE BeadChip arrays and targeted assays. RESULTS: Prevalence of overall and Rh-specific alloimmunization varied among institutions, ranging from 5% to 41% (p = .0035) and 5%-33% (p = .0002), respectively. RH genotyping demonstrated that 33% RHD and 57% RHCE alleles were variant in this cohort. Patients with RHCE alleles encoding partial e antigens had higher rates of anti-e identified than those encoding at least one conventional e antigen (p = .0007). There was no difference in anti-D, anti-C, or anti-E formation among patients with predicted partial or altered antigen expression compared to those with conventional antigens, suggesting that variant Rh on donor cells may also stimulate alloimmunization to these antigens. DISCUSSION: These results highlight variability in alloimmunization rates and suggest that a molecular approach to Rh antigen matching may be necessary for optimal prevention of alloimmunization given the high prevalence of variant RH alleles among both patients and Black donors.
35834752	Persistence of chronic inflammation after regular blood transfusion therapy in sickle cell anemia.	
32497305	Characteristics and potential biomarkers of adult sickle cell patients with chronic pain.	OBJECTIVES: In this study, we investigated the evolution of chronic pain in sickle cell patients (SCD) as an age-dependent phenomenon and studied the frequency of vaso-occlusive episode frequency, opioid use, quantitative sensory testing (QST), and biomarkers of chronic pain (CP). METHODS: We undertook a cross-sectional study of the evolution of CP in SCD. A total of 72 subjects (age 15-66) were enrolled. VOE frequency, presence of CP hydroxyurea (HU) therapy, opioid use, and laboratory parameters were collected. QST was performed, and plasma tryptase, substance P, and NGF (Nerve Growth Factor) levels were assayed. RESULTS: There was an age-dependent increase in frequency of CP, VOEs, opioid use, and Von Frey monofilament values. CP patients had significantly higher opioid use (daily morphine equivalents) (52.8 mg vs 6.94 mg, P = .009), suggesting a correlation between opioid use and hyperalgesia. NGF levels were also significantly higher (P = .051). Our results confirm previous observations of an age-dependent increase in the proportion of patients with CP and support the contributing role of mast cell activation and neurogenic inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study of NGF as a possible biomarker of CP in SCD. If confirmed, this could provide a diagnostic marker and therapeutic target for CP in SCD.
34688625	Strategic priorities for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in the EMRO region.	The World Health Organization-designated Eastern Mediterranean region (EMRO) consists of 22 countries in North Africa and Western Asia with a collective population of over 679 million. The area comprises some of the wealthiest countries per capita income and some of the poorest. The population structure is also unique and contrasts with western countries, with a much younger population. The region sits in the heart of the thalassemia belt. Many countries have a significant prevalence of sickle cell disease, and cancer is on the rise in the region. Therefore, the strategic priorities for the growth and development of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) differ from country to country based on resources, healthcare challenges, and prevalent infrastructure. Thirty-one reporting teams to the Eastern Mediterranean Blood and Marrow Transplantation Group have active HSCT programs in 12 countries; allogeneic transplants outnumber autologous transplants, and the proportion of allotransplants for non-malignant conditions is higher in the EMRO region than in Western Europe and North America. The vast majority (99%) of allotransplants are from matched related donors. Matched unrelated donors and other alternate donor transplants are underutilized. The chance of finding a matched related donor for allografts is higher, with a significant chance of finding matched donors among non-sibling related donors. Reasons for relatively lower rates of transplants compared with other countries are multifactorial. Capacity building, development of newer centers, innovative funding, and better utilization of information technology are required to make transplantation as an accessible modality to more patients. Cost-effectiveness and cost-containment, regulation, and ensuring quality will all be priorities in planning HSCT development in the region.
34955521	Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in a Previously Vaccinated Adolescent Female With Sickle Cell Disease.	Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a serious complication that is observed most commonly in pediatric patients following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections. However, the mechanism and predictors of disease are poorly understood. There are no prior reports of MIS-C among patients who have been fully vaccinated, and only a single case of MIS in an adult patient who had received his second shot just 4 days prior to symptom onset. Here, we present an adolescent with sickle cell disease who was fully vaccinated against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and had no prior history of known or suspected infection, who presented in shock and was ultimately diagnosed with MIS-C. This case highlights the importance of clinical suspicion for MIS-C even when patients are fully vaccinated.
38167227	Successful Conservative Therapy for Infected Penile Implants: A Case Series.	BACKGROUND Traditionally, penile implant infections have been treated by removal followed by immediate or delayed replacement. The use of antibiotics in conservative therapy has recently attracted attention. CASE REPORT We report our experience with 4 cases of infected penile implants managed conservatively. Case 1 was a 41-year-old with sickle cell anemia who presented with low-grade fever and purulent discharge that started 1 month postoperatively and lasted for 3 weeks. He had left graft after fibrotic tissue excision with 14-mm collection in the left corpus cavernosum. He was managed with IV pipracillin/tazobactam and vancomycin for 13 days. Follow-up after 23 weeks showed complete wound healing. Case 2 was a 62-year-old with diabetes who had purulent discharge that started 41 days postoperatively and lasted for 1 week. He received 5 days of IV vancomycin and gentamycin. Follow-up after 4 weeks showed marked improvement of the wound. Case 3 was a 61-year-old with diabetes and ischemic heart disease. He presented 30 days postoperatively with fever, purulent discharge for 5 days. He received a total of 10 days of IV vancomycin and gentamycin. Follow-up 3 weeks after discharge showed complete wound healing. Case 4 was a 61-year-old with diabetes and ischemic heart disease. He presented 1 month postoperatively with fever and pus discharge for 1 week. He completed 10 days of IV vancomycin and gentamycin. Follow-up after 1 week showed marked wound healing. CONCLUSIONS Choosing patients with early superficial infected penile prosthesis for conservative management should be tailored to selected patients who does not have leukocytosis, signs of sepsis, high-grade fever, or an exposed device.
34118373	Acupuncture as an Adjunctive Treatment for Pain in Hospitalized Children With Sickle Cell Disease.	CONTEXT: Acute episodes of pain associated with sickle cell disease (SCD) account for over 100,000 hospitalizations and expenses of nearly one billion dollars annually in the U.S. New treatment approaches are needed as the current opioid based therapy is often inadequate in controlling pain, resulting in prolonged inpatient stays, and high rates of readmission. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate acceptability of acupuncture as an adjunctive therapy and explore the impact of acupuncture on pain related outcomes in a population of youth with SCD hospitalized for management of acute pain. METHODS: This IRB approved single center study recruited youth with SCD (9-20 years) who were hospitalized for management of acute pain into either the acupuncture group or controls. Both groups also received standard pain management therapies. RESULTS: Participants in the acupuncture (n = 19) and control (n = 10) group were comparable in clinical characteristics. Acupuncture had an acceptability rate of over 66% and was tolerated well without any side effects. Acupuncture was associated with reduction in pain scores (6.84-5.51; P < 0.0001). Acupuncture group demonstrated a trend toward lower length of stay and readmission rates, but these were not statistically significant. Opioid use was not different between the groups. Treatment Evaluation Inventory survey showed high rates of satisfaction with acupuncture. CONCLUSION: Acupuncture was broadly accepted and well-tolerated in our study population. Acupuncture treatment was associated with a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in pain scores immediately following the treatments, and a trend towards a reduction in length of stay and readmission for pain.
36206076	Global perspectives on cellular therapy for children with sickle cell disease.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), primarily in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), predominantly experience the burden of sickle cell disease (SCD). High frequency of acute and chronic complications leads to increased utilization of healthcare, which burdens fragile health systems. Mortality for children with limited healthcare access remains alarmingly high. Cellular based therapies such as allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) are increasingly used in resource-rich settings as curative therapy for SCD. Broad access to curative therapies for SCD in SSA would dramatically alter the global impact of the disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Currently, application of cellular based therapies in LMICs is limited by cost, personnel, and availability of HSCT-specific technologies and supportive care. Despite the challenges, HSCT for SCD is moving forward in LMICs. Highly anticipated gene modification therapies have recently proven well tolerated and feasible in clinical trials in resource-rich countries, but access remains extremely limited. SUMMARY: Translation of curative cellular based therapies for SCD should be prioritized to LMICs where the disease burden and cost of noncurative treatments is high, and long-term quality of life is poor. Focus on thoughtful modifications of current and future therapies to meet the need in LMICs, especially in SSA, will be especially impactful.
36351365	The Development and Consequences of Red Blood Cell Alloimmunization.	While red blood cell (RBC) transfusion is the most common medical intervention in hospitalized patients, as with any therapeutic, it is not without risk. Allogeneic RBC exposure can result in recipient alloimmunization, which can limit the availability of compatible RBCs for future transfusions and increase the risk of transfusion complications. Despite these challenges and the discovery of RBC alloantigens more than a century ago, relatively little has historically been known regarding the immune factors that regulate RBC alloantibody formation. Through recent epidemiological approaches, in vitro-based translational studies, and newly developed preclinical models, the processes that govern RBC alloimmunization have emerged as more complex and intriguing than previously appreciated. Although common alloimmunization mechanisms exist, distinct immune pathways can be engaged, depending on the target alloantigen involved. Despite this complexity, key themes are beginning to emerge that may provide promising approaches to not only actively prevent but also possibly alleviate the most severe complications of RBC alloimmunization.
32888326	Successful management of sirolimus toxicity in a hematopoietic stem cell transplant patient using automated red blood cell exchange.	BACKGROUND: Sirolimus is an immunosuppressive agent used in organ rejection prophylaxis in solid-organ transplantation, graft-vs-host disease prophylaxis in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and as an immune modulator for patients with lymphangioleiomyomatosis and vascular malformations. Sirolimus has a narrow therapeutic index with potential severe side effects, including hypertension, hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and neurotoxicity. CASE REPORT: We report a case of a 19-year-old woman with severe sickle cell disease who underwent a matched unrelated hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, whose course was complicated by sirolimus toxicity. This case was challenging because sirolimus has no specific antidote, is largely bound to red blood cells (RBCs), has a high distribution volume, and cannot be removed by dialysis or plasmapheresis. RESULT: Due to the concern for toxicity, we looked into possibilities for rapid sirolimus clearance using automated RBC exchange. The treatment was effective in decreasing blood sirolimus levels within the therapeutic ranges. CONCLUSION: The use of RBC exchange is potentially safe and effective in the management of a case of sirolimus toxicity.
34503994	5-Aza-4'-thio-2'-deoxycytidine, a New Orally Bioavailable Nontoxic "Best-in-Class": DNA Methyltransferase 1-Depleting Agent in Clinical Development.	DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) 1 is an enzyme that functions as a maintenance methyltransferase during DNA replication, and depletion of this enzyme from cells is considered to be a rational goal in DNA methylation-dependent disorders. Two DNMT1-depleting agents 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (aza-dCyd, decitabine) and 5-aza-cytidine (aza-Cyd, azacitidine) are currently used for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia and have also been investigated for nononcology indications, such as sickle cell disease. However, these agents have several off-target activities leading to significant toxicities that limit dosing and duration of treatment. Development of more selective inhibitors of DNMT1 could therefore afford treatment of long durations at effective doses. We have discovered that 5-aza-4'-thio-2'-deoxycytidine (aza-T-dCyd) is as effective as aza-dCyd in depleting DNMT1 in mouse tumor models but with markedly low toxicity. In this review we describe the preclinical studies that led to the development of aza-T-dCyd as a superior DNMT1-depleting agent with respect to aza-dCyd and will describe its pharmacology, metabolism, and mechanism of action. In an effort to understand why aza-T-dCyd is a more selective DNMT1 depleting agent than aza-dCyd, we will also compare and contrast the activities of these two agents. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Aza-T-dCyd is a potent DNMT1-depleting agent. Although similar in structure to decitabine (aza-dCyd), its metabolism and mechanism of action is different than that of aza-dCyd, resulting in less off-target activity and less toxicity. The larger therapeutic index of aza-T-dCyd (DNMT1 depletion vs. toxicity) in mice suggests that it would be a better clinical candidate to selectively deplete DNMT1 from target cells and determine whether or not depletion of DNMT1 is an effective target for various diseases.
32893706	How I Treat Acute Chest Syndrome in Asthmatic Children with Sickle Cell Disease. A Practical Review.	Asthma is associated with increased rate of acute chest syndrome (ACS), pain episodes and premature death. Differentiating between an acute asthma exacerbation and ACS is a challenge clinically as they can present with similar symptoms. Clinicians should be aware of symptoms of asthma or broncho spasm in any children with sickle cell disease, as adequate treatments are required. In this mini-review, we selected 16 clinical studies, published in English between 2004 and 2016, and reviewed all of the abstracts and references of the selected articles. We subsequently selected articles that were focused on asthma in children with sickle cell disease. Given the pathophysiological mechanisms of ACS and the association between asthma and sickle cell disease, the management approach of asthmatic children should be clarified. Bronchodilators should be used if there are clinical features suggestive of a history of asthma or evidence of acute broncho spasm. The indication for cortisone should be reassessed. This literature review failed to conclude on therapeutic modalities of ACS in asthmatic children with sickle cell disease. Only a well designed, multicenter adequately-powered randomized controlled study of each of them will allow assessing their real benefits and risks.
32207531	Gene editing and CRISPR in the clinic: current and future perspectives.	Genome editing technologies, particularly those based on zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat DNA sequences)/Cas9 are rapidly progressing into clinical trials. Most clinical use of CRISPR to date has focused on ex vivo gene editing of cells followed by their re-introduction back into the patient. The ex vivo editing approach is highly effective for many disease states, including cancers and sickle cell disease, but ideally genome editing would also be applied to diseases which require cell modification in vivo. However, in vivo use of CRISPR technologies can be confounded by problems such as off-target editing, inefficient or off-target delivery, and stimulation of counterproductive immune responses. Current research addressing these issues may provide new opportunities for use of CRISPR in the clinical space. In this review, we examine the current status and scientific basis of clinical trials featuring ZFNs, TALENs, and CRISPR-based genome editing, the known limitations of CRISPR use in humans, and the rapidly developing CRISPR engineering space that should lay the groundwork for further translation to clinical application.
33711512	Pain in sickle cell disease: current and potential translational therapies.	Pain is a major comorbidity of sickle cell disease (SCD). Patients with SCD may suffer from both acute and chronic pain. Acute pain is caused by recurrent and unpredictable episodes of vaso-occlusive crises (VOC), whereas the exact etiology of chronic pain is still unknown. Opioids are the mainstay for pain treatment, but the opioid epidemic has significantly altered access to prescription opioids and has brought concerns over their long-term use into the forefront, which have negatively impacted the treatment of sickle pain. Opioids remain potent analgesics but growing opioid-phobia has led to the realization of an unmet need to develop nonopioid therapies that can provide relief for severe sickle pain. This realization has contributed to the approval of 3 different drugs by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of SCD, particularly to reduce VOC and/or have an impact on the pathobiology of SCD. In this review, we outline the challenges and need for validation of side-effects of opioids and provide an update on the development of mechanism-based translational therapies, specifically targeting pain in SCD.
36539362	Challenges and opportunities in shared care for international patients treated with cellular therapy for nonmalignant disease.	As cellular therapies gradually become the mainstay of treatment for several nonmalignant diseases, there appears to be varied accessibility to these therapies globally. Despite considerable burden of nonmalignant conditions, such as sickle cell disease, thalassemia, and aplastic anemia in populations of low-middle-income countries, the utilization of cellular therapies remain sparse because of lack of resources. Globally, the frequency of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) has increased disproportionately in countries with higher gross national income (GNI) per capita, governmental healthcare expenditures, and a high human development index. This leads to a large subset of international patients seeking care in the United States. This review summarizes the unique set of challenges that often arise when offering sophisticated therapies such as HSCT to international patients constituting of cross-cultural, logistical, financial, and medical challenges and the opportunities that are available to bridge the gap.
37783810	Discontinued CRISPR gene therapy for sickle-cell disease improves symptoms.	
34469415	Decision-Making Involvement, Self-Efficacy, and Transition Readiness in Youth With Sickle Cell Disease.	BACKGROUND: Transition to adult healthcare is a critical time for adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with sickle cell disease, and preparation for transition is important to reducing morbidity and mortality risks associated with transition. OBJECTIVE: We explored the relationships between decision-making involvement, self-efficacy, healthcare responsibility, and overall transition readiness in AYAs with sickle cell disease prior to transition. METHODS: This cross-sectional, correlational study was conducted with 50 family caregivers-AYAs dyads receiving care from a large comprehensive sickle cell clinic between October 2019 and February 2020. Participants completed the Decision-Making Involvement Scale, the Sickle Cell Self-Efficacy Scale, and the Readiness to Transition Questionnaire. Multiple linear regression was used to assess the relationships between decision-making involvement, self-efficacy, healthcare responsibility, and overall transition readiness in AYAs with sickle cell disease prior to transition to adult healthcare. RESULTS: Whereas higher levels of expressive behaviors, such as sharing opinions and ideas in decision-making, were associated with higher levels of AYA healthcare responsibility, those behaviors were inversely associated with feelings of overall transition readiness. Self-efficacy was positively associated with overall transition readiness but inversely related to AYA healthcare responsibility. Parent involvement was negatively associated with AYA healthcare responsibility and overall transition readiness. DISCUSSION: While increasing AYAs' decision-making involvement may improve AYAs' healthcare responsibility, it may not reduce barriers of feeling unprepared for the transition to adult healthcare. Facilitating active AYA involvement in decision-making regarding disease management, increasing self-efficacy, and safely reducing parent involvement may positively influence their confidence and capacity for self-management.
33246448	Proteus empyema as a rare complication from an infected renal cyst, a case report.	BACKGROUND: The most commonly isolated organisms in a parapneumonic effusion include S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and S. aureus. If unusual organisms are isolated from the pleural space, further investigation is warranted to locate the primary source. We present a patient with an infected chronic renal cyst found to have an empyema secondary to Proteus mirabilis to highlight the importance of further diagnostic workup when encountering unusual organisms in the pleural space. CASE PRESENTATION: A 40-year-old African-American female, with a past medical history of asthma and sickle cell trait, presented with 5 weeks of upper respiratory tract symptoms and chest pain. A computed tomography angiogram (CTA) of the chest was negative for a pulmonary embolism but revealed a loculated left sided pleural effusion with associated left-lower lobe consolidation. She was started on empiric antibiotics, and a chest tube was inserted with drainage of frank pus. Fluid gram stain was positive for gram negative rods. Intrapleural fibrinolytics were administered for 72 h given the presence of loculations. With no improvement following fibrinolytics, she was taken to the operating room for large bore chest tube placement and left visceral pleura decortication. Pleural fluid cultures speciated to Proteus mirabilis, so further cross-sectional imaging of her abdomen/pelvis was pursued to evaluate for a primary source. A complex cystic lesion in the upper pole of the left kidney that communicated with the ipsilateral diaphragm was identified. Subsequent drainage and culture of the renal cyst was positive for Proteus mirabilis. Given clinical improvement following these interventions she was discharged with an extended course of antibiotics with plans for repeat imaging following completion of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: While cases of Proteus mirabilis empyema have previously been reported as a consequence of conditions such as pyelonephritis, we present, to our knowledge, the first case of a Proteus mirabilis empyema as a consequence of an infected renal cyst communicating with the pleural space. This study highlights that further evaluation with cross-sectional imaging is warranted when unusual organisms are found in the pleural space. Anatomic abnormalities that become apparent on imaging may help elucidate the source of infection.
37450055	Age-related differences in risks and outcomes of 30-day readmission in adults with sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Literature on 30-day readmission in adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) is limited. This study examined the overall and age-stratified rates, risk factors, and healthcare resource utilization associated with 30-day readmission in this population. METHODS: Using the Nationwide Readmissions Database, a retrospective cohort study was conducted to identify adult patients (aged >= 18) with SCD in 2016. Patients were stratified by age and followed for 30 days to assess readmission following an index discharge. The primary outcome was 30-day unplanned all-cause readmission. Secondary outcomes included index hospitalization costs and readmission outcomes (e.g., time to readmission, readmission costs, and readmission lengths of stay). Separate generalized linear mixed models estimated the adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for associations of readmission with patient and hospital characteristics, overall and by age. RESULTS: Of 15,167 adults with SCD, 2,863 (18.9%) experienced readmission. Both the rates and odds of readmission decreased with increasing age. The SCD complications vaso-occlusive crisis and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) were significantly associated with increased likelihood of readmission (p < 0.05). Age-stratified analyses demonstrated that diagnosis of depression significantly increased risk of readmission among patients aged 18-to-29 years (aOR = 1.537, 95%CI: 1.215-1.945) but not among patients of other ages. All secondary outcomes significantly differed by age (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that patients with SCD are at very high risk of 30-day readmission and that younger adults and those with vaso-occlusive crisis and ESRD are among those at highest risk. Multifaceted, age-specific interventions targeting individuals with SCD on disease management are needed to prevent readmissions.
38422317	Transfusion of packed red blood cells in adults with sickle cell anemia treated at an emergency hospital.	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze the prescription of packed red blood cells performed by emergency physicians for adults with sickle cell anemia. METHODS: Transfusions performed in adults with sickle cell anemia treated at an emergency service in Sao Bernardo do Campo, Sao Paulo Brazil, between January 2018 and January 2022 were evaluated. For data comparison, the chi-square2 test was used. The significance level adopted was 5%. RESULTS: A total of 114 transfusions were performed. The mean age was 41.8+-16.4 years, and pretransfusion hemoglobin was 6.1+-1.23 g/dL. Regarding the indication, the adequacy of transfusions performed in symptomatic individuals was significantly higher compared to asymptomatic individuals (100% vs. 3.9%, p<0.001). Symptomatic individuals received excessive volumes of packed red blood cells less frequently than asymptomatic individuals (17.5% vs. 56.9%, p<0.001). The filtered subtype, indicated for sickle cell anemia, was prescribed in only a quarter of the patients. However, non-indicated subtypes were frequently prescribed. CONCLUSION: This study found low adequacy in the indication and calculation of the transfusion volume of packed red blood cells in asymptomatic individuals. Few patients received filtered red blood cells, resulting in increased risks of transfusion reactions. On the contrary, non-indicated subtypes were prescribed in a quarter of transfusions, which resulted in higher costs and delay in receiving packed red blood cells.
34152394	Measures to reduce red cell use in patients with sickle cell disease requiring red cell exchange during a blood shortage.	The COVID-19 pandemic has created major disruptions in health care delivery, including a severe blood shortage. The inventory of Rh and K antigen-negative red cell units recommended for patients with hemoglobinopathies became alarmingly low and continues to be strained. Because patients with sickle cell disease requiring chronic red cell exchange (RCE) incur a large demand for red cell units, we hypothesized that implementation of 2 measures could reduce blood use. First, obtaining the pretransfusion hemoglobin S (HbS) results by procedure start time would facilitate calculation of exact red cell volume needed to achieve the desired post-RCE HbS. Second, as a short-term conservation method, we identified patients for whom increasing the targeted end procedure hematocrit up to 5 percentage points higher than the pretransfusion level (no higher than 36%) was not medically contraindicated. The goal was to enhance suppression of endogenous erythropoiesis and thereby reduce the red cell unit number needed to maintain the same target HbS%. These 2 measures resulted in an 18% reduction of red cell units transfused to 50 patients undergoing chronic RCE during the first 6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite reduction of blood use, pretransfusion HbS% target goals were maintained and net iron accumulation was low. Both strategies can help alleviate a shortage of Rh and K antigen-negative red cells, and, more generally, transfusing red cell units based on precise red cell volume required can optimize patient care and judicious use of blood resources.
38626063	Acute care utilization among individuals with sickle cell disease and related cardiopulmonary and renal complications.	Cardiopulmonary and renal end organ (CPR) complications are associated with early mortality among individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD). However, there is limited knowledge regarding acute care utilization for individuals with SCD and CPR complications. Our objective was to determine the prevalence of CPR complications in a state specific SCD population and compare acute care utilization among individuals with and without CPR complications. We leveraged 2017-2020 data for individuals with SCD identified by the Sickle Cell Data Collection program in Wisconsin. The prevalence of CPR complications is determined for distinct age groups. Generalized linear models adjusted for age compared the rate of acute care visits/person/year among individuals who had cardiopulmonary only, renal only, both cardiopulmonary and renal, or no CPR complications. There were 1378 individuals with SCD, 52% females, mean (SD) age 28.3 (18.5) years; 48% had at least one CPR complication during the study period. The prevalence of CPR complications was higher in adults (69%) compared to pediatric (15%) and transition (51%) groups. Individuals with SCD and cardiopulmonary complications had higher acute visit rates than those without CPR complications (5.4 (IQR 5.0-5.8) vs 2.4 (IQR 2.1-2.5), p <0.001)). Acute care visit rates were similar between individuals with SCD who had renal only complications and no CPR complications (2.7 (IQR 2.5-3.0) vs 2.4 (2.1-2.5), p = 0.24). The high acute care visit rates, especially for those with cardiopulmonary complications, warrant further investigation to understand risk factors for CPR complications, the underlying reasons and identify effective disease management strategies.

34400054	Therapeutic approach to pediatric patients with acute chest syndrome: national multicenter survey of non invasive ventilation (NIV) and transfusion.	BACKGROUND: Intensive care units (ICUs) have seen a spike in the use of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) for many medical conditions. We sought to investigate the attitudes and clinical practice regarding the management of acute chest syndrome (ACS) with a focus on NIV in pediatric ICUs. METHOD: Members of the French Group for Pediatric Intensive Care Emergencies (GFRUP) were asked to complete an online survey on physicians' attitudes toward children with ACS admitted to the PICU during 2015. RESULTS: The survey was answered by teams from 17 PICUs (240 beds). In total, 15 centers (88%) had a local transfusion unit and 14 (82%) worked in connection with a sickle cell disease (SCD) reference center. During 2015, 360 patients with SCD were managed (median: 7 per center; 21) of whom 137 (38%) for an ACS (median: 4 ACS per center; 8). The median length of PICU stay for ACS was 5 days (3.1). Among the 137 patients who presented with ACS, 73 (53%) received simple blood transfusion and 16 (12%) received exchange transfusion. For patients who required noninvasive ventilatory support, NIV with bilevel pressure (BiPAP) was the most frequent method (n = 68, 50%), followed by continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) (n = 23, 17%) and high-flow oxygen (n = 21, 15%). The proportion of patients on BiPAP was up to 71% in the centers most frequently managing ACS patients. CONCLUSION: BiPAP is commonly used in PICUs for SCD patients with ACS, especially in trained centers. Future physiological studies and randomized controlled trials might help to choose the best ventilatory support for ACS.
34090916	Differences between children with severe acute lower respiratory infection with or without SARS-Cov-2 infection.	AIM: to compare clinical features and outcome of children with severe acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) with or without SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU). METHODS: for this retrospective cohort study, all children aged<17 years admitted with severe ALRI at a PICU, in Salvador, Brazil were evaluated. Investigation of SARS-CoV-2 infection was performed by real-time reverse-transcription PCR. Clinical data, physical findings upon admission and outcome were registered. Patients were categorized by with or without SARS-Cov-2 infection. Outcomes were death and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). RESULTS: we enrolled 210 patients, whose median age was 2.8 years (IQR: 7.1 months-6.2 years). IMV was used in 33 (15.7%; 95%CI 11.3%-21.1%) patients. Eight (3.8%; 95%CI 1.8%-7.1%) cases died. 62 patients (29.5%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Male gender (67.7% vs. 52.7%, P = 0.045) and sickle cell disease (6.5% vs. 0%, P = 0.007) were associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Wheezing upon admission was more common in patients without SARS-CoV-2 infection (38.5% vs. 21.0%, P = 0.01). IMV was more frequent among patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection (25.8% vs. 11.5%, P = 0.009) as well as death (8.1% vs. 2.0%, P = 0.05). CONCLUSION: children with severe ALRI infection with SARS-CoV-2 need IMV more frequently than those without it.
35417940	Factors associated with left ventricular hypertrophy in children with sickle cell disease: results from the DISPLACE study.	Cardiopulmonary complications remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in sickle cell disease (SCD). The overall goals of this study were to evaluate the relationship between left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and laboratory markers of hemolysis and determine the association between LVH and SCD-specific therapies (hydroxyurea and chronic red cell transfusion). Data from the DISPLACE (Dissemination and Implementation of Stroke Prevention Looking at the Care Environment) study cohort was used. LVH was defined based on the left ventricular mass indexed to the body surface area as left ventricular mass index >103.0 g/m2 for males and >84.2 g/m2 for females. There were 1,409 children included in the analysis and 20.3% had LVH. Results of multivariable analysis of LVH showed baseline hemoglobin levels were associated with the lower odds of having LVH (odds ratio [OR]: 0.71, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.60- 0.84). The odds of LVH increases for every 1-year increase in age (OR: 1.07, 95% CI: 1.02-1.13). Similarly, the odds of LVH were lower among males than females (OR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.38-0.93). The odds of LVH were higher among those on hydroxyurea compared to no therapy (OR: 1.83, 95% CI: 1.41-2.37). Overall results of the study showed that LVH occurs early in children with SCD and the risk increases with increasing age and with lower hemoglobin. Further, we found higher use of hydroxyurea among those with LVH, suggesting that the need for hydroxyurea conveys a risk of cardiovascular remodeling.
38394231	Sickle Cell Disease in an Older Adult Population: A Retrospective Review of Health Care Resource Utilization.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) has a history of health inequity, as patients with SCD are primarily Black and often marginalized from the health care system. Although recent health care and treatment advancements have prolonged life expectancy, it may be insufficient to support the complex needs of the growing population of older adults with SCD. This retrospective study used a cohort (N = 812) of Medicare Advantage beneficiaries 45 years and older (ages: 45-54, 55-64, 65-74, 75-89) with SCD to identify associations of SCD-related complications and comorbidities with emergency department (ED) visits, potentially avoidable ED visits, all-cause hospitalization, and potentially avoidable hospitalizations, 2018-2020. The 75-89 age group had lower odds of an ED visit (OR 0.56; 95% CI 0.32-1.00), 65-74 age group had lower odds of an ED visit (OR 0.49; 95% CI 0.31-0.78) and hospitalization (OR 0.50; 95% CI 0.31-0.79), compared with the 45-54 age group. Acute chest syndrome was associated with increased odds of an ED visit (OR 2.02; 95% CI 1.10-3.71), avoidable ED visit (OR 1.87; 95% CI 1.14-3.06), and hospitalization (OR 3.61; 95% CI 2.06-6.31). Pain was associated with increased odds of an ED visit (OR 2.64; 95% CI 1.85-3.76), an avoidable ED visit (OR 3.08; 95% CI 1.90-4.98), hospitalization (OR 1.51; 95% CI 1.02-2.24), and avoidable hospitalization (OR 6.42; 95% CI 1.74-23.74). Older adults with SCD have been living with SCD for decades, often while managing pain crises and complications associated increased incidence of an ED visit and hospitalization. The characteristics and needs of this population must continue to be examined to increase preventative care and reduce costly emergent health care resource utilization.
36602417	Time to pain relief: A randomized controlled trial in the emergency department during vaso-occlusive episodes in sickle cell disease.	OBJECTIVE: Compare time to pain relief (minimum of a 13 mm and 30% reduction) during an Emergency Department (ED) visit among patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) experiencing severe pain associated with a vaso-occlusive episode who were randomized to receive either an individualized or weight-based pain protocol. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial in two EDs. Adults with sickle cell disease. Research staff recorded pain scores every 30 min during an ED visit (up to 6 h in the ED) using a 0-100 mm visual analogue scale. Analysis included 122 visits, representing 49 patients (individualized: 61 visits, 25 patients; standard: 61 visits, 24 patients). RESULTS: Pain reduction across 6-h was greater for the individualized compared to the standard protocol (protocol-by-time: p = .02; 6-h adjusted pain score comparison: Individualized: M = 29.2, SD = 38.8, standard: M = 45.3, SD = 35.6; p = .03, Cohen d = 0.43). Hazards models indicated a greater probability of 13 mm (HR = 1.54, 95% CI = 1.05, 2.27, p = .03) and 30% (HR = 1.71, 95% CI = 1.11, 2.63, p = .01) reduction in the individualized relative to the standard protocol. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who received treatment with an individualized protocol experienced a more rapid reduction in pain, including a 13 mm and 30% reduction in pain scores when compared to those that received weight-based dosing.
38082534	Hoping for a normal life: Decision-making on hematopoietic stem cell transplantation by patients with a hemoglobinopathy and their caregivers.	BACKGROUND: To provide insight into the perspectives of children and young adults with transfusion-dependent thalassemia and sickle cell disease and their caregivers regarding the decision for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). PROCEDURE: A qualitative longitudinal multicenter study. Data collection consisted of 40 audio-recorded conversations between physicians and families and 77 interviews with patients and/or caregivers related to 27 unique cases, collected at different time points throughout the decision-making process. RESULTS: Conversations and interviews revealed "hoping for a normal life" as an overarching theme, consisting of four main topics: (i) "Building a frame of reference" refers to a process where patients or families try to obtain comprehensive information on HSCT and translate this to their situation to decide. (ii) "Balancing between loss and benefit" reports the process of considering the advantages and disadvantages of continuing with supportive care to treat their disease versus choosing HSCT. (iii) "Experiencing the impact of HSCT" describes the impactfull experience of the HSCT period by those who chose HSCT. (iv) "Balancing again" refers to reflecting on the decision made. CONCLUSIONS: The hope for a normal life guided the decision-making process, described as a constant balance between the impact of the disease and HSCT. A structured approach to explore patients' and caregivers' perspectives on HSCT decision-making is needed, where specifically discussing the impact of the disease and hope for a normal life need to be integrated in the process.

38302122	Curative Therapies for Sickle Cell Disease.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an autosomal recessive hemoglobinopathy that affects individuals worldwide. The mutation in the beta-globin gene leads to abnormal hemoglobin production, sickle hemoglobin, which polymerizes under stress leading to, among other end-organ manifestations, chronic hemolytic anemia, debilitating vaso-occlusive crises, and stroke. Unfortunately, chronic stress on end-organs impacts the life expectancy of patients with SCD, which in the United States averages 43 years, approximately 36 years less than people without the disease. Here, we review the progress made in curative interventions for those with SCD, namely allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation and gene therapy. These interventions continue to evolve as we better understand SCD pathophysiology, use new graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis regimens, expand stem cell donor options, and understand the genetic control of hemoglobin production. Although significant progress has been made, many gaps remain in the successful implementation of these interventions globally and for all patients. [Pediatr Ann. 2024;53(2):e56-e61.].
35767590	Evaluation of Guideline-Recommended Pain Management in Acute Sickle Cell Crisis and Its Effect on Patient Outcomes.	This was a retrospective, multi-site observational cohort of 233 encounters of patients with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) who received analgesia for acute pain crisis related to SCD from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019. Patient encounters were categorized based on whether they received analgesia within guideline directed 60 minutes of emergency department (ED) arrival. The primary outcome was time to a pain score reduction of >=30% on the numerical rating scale. Assessments were also conducted for potential disparities leading to suboptimal care. Time to pain score reduction of >=30% was significantly less in those receiving analgesia within 60 minutes of arrival compared to delayed analgesia [3.5 hours (2.5-10) vs 8.0 hours (4.5-22.5), p < 0.001]. Patients receiving timely analgesia also saw a faster time to ED disposition and achieved pain reduction goals more frequently at hospital discharge. We found that patients with a history of substance use disorder documented in their chart were less likely to receive timely analgesia. Our study indicated that when patients with SCD received analgesia in accordance with guideline recommendations, pain goals were achieved faster with an improvement in outcomes. Providing optimal care can be difficult, but education and standardized policies may help mitigate this gap.
33975503	Ferroportin-inhibitor salt: patent evaluation WO2018192973.	INTRODUCTION: Iron is a crucial element necessary for blood formation in the body and its normal growth. However, irregular metabolism of iron due to absence of an elimination mechanism may deposit excess iron in the organs (iron overload) leading to metabolic disorders. Interactions between the iron regulatory peptide hormone, hepcidin and the iron exporter ferroportin plays major role in regulating the iron metabolism. Mutations in the ferroportin encoding genes, and dysregulation of hepsidin production often results in iron overload resulting in conditions like hemochromatosis, beta-thalassemia, and sickle cell anemia. Until today, there is no efficacious treatment available for managing iron overload targeting ferroportin inhibition via oral administration. AREAS COVERED: Novel salts of substituted benzoimidazole compounds useful for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of iron overload are claimed. These compounds act as hepcidin mimetic and inhibit the ferroportin thereby preventing iron overload. The claimed actives are useful in the treatment of disease conditions such as neurodegenerative and cardiac diseases triggered by iron overload. Preclinical studies of these salts on mouse model are also discussed. EXPERT OPINION: Prevention and/or treatment of iron overload is critical. The claimed compounds are the first oral drug candidate to treat iron overload and reach the pre-clinical development stage.
32883819	The Use of Music by Adolescents and Young Adults With Sickle Cell Disease.	Pain is common and often severe in people with sickle cell disease (SCD), occurring as acute intermittent pain episodes called vaso-occlusive episodes (VOEs), as well as chronic pain conditions including bone infarctions, avascular necrosis of joints, and neuropathic pain. Analgesics such as opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDS), and anticonvulsants for neuropathic pain, although often necessary to manage these types of pain, are associated with side effects. Nonpharmacologic interventions such as to listening to music and music therapy may reduce pain. The objectives of this study were to determine whether the use of music by adolescents and young adults with SCD was helpful, and if so, the types of music that helped, and how music helped them. A convenience sample of nine English-speaking inpatients ages 13 to 21 years, with SCD and at least two prior hospitalizations for VOE, took part in interviews with music therapists. Participants were asked open-ended questions about both pain and music. Participants identified that music was helpful for pain relief as well as for mood regulation, focusing attention during cognitive tasks such as homework, distraction, relaxation, and feeling understood or connected with others. Despite this, while hospitalized, participants reported that they did not tend to use music to help with pain. These findings support the use of both music medicine and music therapy as interventions for pain and distress in adolescents and young adults with SCD.
32469138	Influenza vaccine effectiveness and disease burden in children and adolescents with sickle cell disease: 2012-2017.	BACKGROUND: Data are limited on the burden of influenza and seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) in children with sickle cell disease (SCD). METHODS: We used a prospectively collected clinical registry of SCD patients 6 months to 21 years of age to determine the influenza cases per 100 patient-years, vaccination rates, and a test-negative case-control study design to estimate influenza VE against medically attended laboratory-confirmed influenza infection. Influenza-positive cases were randomly matched to test-negative controls on age and influenza season in 1:1 ratio. We used adjusted logistic regression models to compare odds ratio (OR) of vaccination in cases to controls. We calculated VE as [100% x (1 - adjusted OR)] and computed 95% confidence intervals (CIs) around the estimate. RESULTS: There were 1037 children with SCD who were tested for influenza, 307 children (29.6%) had at least one influenza infection (338 infections, incidence rate 3.7 per 100 person-years; 95% CI, 3.4-4.1) and 56.2% of those tested received annual influenza vaccine. Overall VE pooled over five seasons was 22.3% (95% CI, -7.3% to 43.7%). Adjusted VE estimates ranged from 39.7% (95% CI, -70.1% to 78.6%) in 2015/2016 to -5.9% (95% CI, -88.4% to 40.4%) in the 2016/17 seasons. Influenza VE varied by age and was highest in children 1-5 years of age (66.6%; 95% CI, 30.3-84.0). Adjusted VE against acute chest syndrome during influenza infection was 39.4% (95% CI, -113.0 to 82.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Influenza VE in patients with SCD varies by season and age. Multicenter prospective studies are needed to better establish and monitor influenza VE among children with SCD.

33224409	Quality of life assessments in a cohort of Mozambican children with sickle cell disease.	INTRODUCTION: sickle cell disease (SCD) has significant pediatric morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa, where access to therapies such as hydroxyurea and opioids is often limited. Poor disease control and Pain management adversely affects the well-being and mental health of affected children. Questionnaires have been utilized in other regions to report the quality of life (QOL) in children with SCD, but assessments from Africa are lacking. METHODS: children age 2-14 years with SCD presenting for routine outpatient consultations at Hospital Central de Maputo from June-August 2017 were offered participation. After informed consent, the Pediatric QOL Inventory (PedsQL) SCD Module was administered to all caregivers and children > 5 years. Responses were scored from 0-100, with higher scores representing better QOL. RESULTS: a total of 14 children were included, with six (43%), four (29%), two (14%), and two (14%) from the age groups of 2-4, 5-7, 8-12, and 13-14 years, respectively. Mean overall patient QOL was 65.3 and 56.0 in child and caregiver respondents. In patients > 5 years, the difference in mean overall QOL for those on/not on hydroxyurea was 0.6 (66.5-64.9) in child respondents and 15.8 (68.4-52.6) in caregiver respondents. Domains related to worry/emotions and communication scored lower in QOL than Pain-related domains for both patient and caregiver respondents. CONCLUSION: SCD has a negative impact on QOL as reported by this cohort of Mozambican pediatric patients and caregivers, with Pain being less of a concern than emotional and interpersonal issues. A comprehensive, child-focused care approach with robust psychosocial support is needed.
33045387	Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation: Practice Predictions for the Year 2023.	Research priorities are best determined by the most pressing scientific questions, in the context of current knowledge. However, definitive research studies take time, while real-world experience accumulates. Adoption of new practices before adequate comparison with current treatments threatens successful study conduct and may expose patients to what ultimately turns out to be inferior treatment. We conducted a survey to understand the hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) community's predictions about future practice trends in the HCT field and results of ongoing Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN) trials to gauge how the HCT community views the treatments being studied. The survey was distributed between February and March 2019 to an electronic mailing list of HCT clinicians practicing in the United States maintained by the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR). Of 986 clinicians surveyed, 315 responded (32%). They predicted an increase in the number of HCTs performed for malignant hematologic diseases and benign diseases such as sickle cell, autoimmune, and genetic disorders. The majority (63%) predicted that matched related donors will remain the preferred donor source for adult HCT recipients in 2023, but 21% predicted haploidentical (haplo) donors and 17% predicted matched unrelated donors would be the preferred source. Most respondents (65%) predicted a decrease in the use of umbilical cord blood (UCB) as a graft source for HCT. Most respondents also predicted that calcineurin-based graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis would be replaced by post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy) (55%), biomarker use would become standard practice to guide GVHD therapy (73%), and steroids would be combined with other agents as first-line therapy for newly diagnosed acute (53%) and chronic GVHD (54%). In ongoing BMT CTN trials in which outcomes are not yet known, 60% to 92% of respondents had an opinion about which arm they thought would be superior. However, not all respondents predicted the same outcome, with 44% to 88% choosing the same arm. There was no clear relationship between the proportion predicting the same arm would win and accrual to the trial. Survey respondents were optimistic about an increasing volume of transplantation procedures, and they also expected significant changes in HCT practice over the next few years, including wider adoption of PTCy GVHD prophylaxis, increased use of biomarkers to guide GVHD therapy, and decreased use of UCB HCT. The degree of equipoise in the community about the relative efficacy of therapies being studied did not seem to affect accrual to current BMT CTN trials, but this is an area that needs further investigation.

32147073	Vitamin D supplementation and pain-related emergency department visits in children with sickle cell disease.	OBJECTIVES: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most prevalent inherited hematological disorder and affects 100,000 individuals in the United States. Pain is the most common cause of emergency department (ED) visits in the SCD population, which profoundly affects quality of life. Vitamin D supplementation is a potential target for reducing pain. Thus, the goal of the present study was to identify the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and explore the relationship between vitamin D supplementation and ED visits in pediatric patients with SCD. DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective chart review of 110 patients with SCD aged 8-16 years who had at least one ED visit for SCD pain during the 6-year study period. Patients were categorized into three vitamin D supplementation groups: patients who did not receive supplementation, patients supplemented with 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels (< 30 ng/mL), and patients supplemented with at least one sufficient 25-hydroxyvitamin D level (>= 30 ng/mL). RESULTS: Overall, 45 % of patients were vitamin D deficient. Only 20 % of patients had sufficient vitamin D levels. This number increased to 55 % when examining only patients who did not receive vitamin D supplementation. For patients supplemented with vitamin D, the number of ED visits was significantly lower after they reached the sufficient range (>= 30 ng/mL), p = 0.03. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that reductions in the number of pain-related ED visits may be achieved by normalizing 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels with supplementation. In addition, findings highlight the need for screening and vitamin D supplementation being incorporated into routine care for pediatric patients with SCD.

34131897	Time to rethink haemoglobin threshold guidelines in sickle cell disease.	Alleviating anaemia in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) is crucial in managing acute complications, mitigating end-organ damage and preventing early mortality. Some disease-modifying and curative therapies have increased haemoglobin (Hb) levels to exceed 100 g/l, a threshold above which complications from red blood cell (RBC) transfusions have occurred, raising concern about whole-blood viscosity-related complications with these therapies. Here we discuss the rationale behind this limit, the effect of viscosity on blood flow and the applicability of this Hb threshold to therapies for SCD beyond RBC transfusions.

38564204	A Novel Mechanistic Model for Future Research in the Elements of the ERAS Program in Patients With Sickle Cell Disease.	Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) is a patient-centered, evidence-based, multidisciplinary team-developed approach to a surgical stress response that is implemented to optimize physiological function and facilitate recovery for the best possible outcomes from surgery. Although there are currently well-known published guidelines for the perioperative management of patients with sickle cell disease, there are currently no specific and evidencebased ERAS protocols that address the needs of these patients. A novel mechanistic model has recently been found that could change ERAS protocols for patients with sickle cell disease with regard to a current preoperative carbohydrate loading drink recommendation, nutrition and intravenous fluid management. ERAS has great benefits for most patient populations, but emerging research suggests that patients with sickle cell disease may process and respond differently to varying concentrations of serum glucose and serum cations (hyperglycemia and hypertonic states). This adverse response involves actin, a cytoskeletal protein, in the red blood cell and how increased hemoglobin glycosylation may lead to a malfunction in this protein and a transition to vaso-occlusive crises in patients with sickle cell disease. Further research is warranted with this new mechanistic model to develop more meticulous and customized perioperative management plans to address risk mitigation in patients with sickle cell disease.

34669981	Alemtuzumab clearance, lymphocyte count, and T-cell chimerism after hematopoietic stem cell transplant in sickle cell disease.	STUDY OBJECTIVE: Alemtuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets the cell surface antigen CD52 on lymphocytes. Although it is used for the treatment of hematologic malignancies, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and incorporated into many hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) conditioning regimens, few studies have evaluated the pharmacology of alemtuzumab in adult patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). We therefore examined the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of alemtuzumab in adults with SCD who received a matched related donor HSCT to determine if the clearance of alemtuzumab affects transplant outcomes. DESIGN: PK and PD analysis of patient data from a single-center clinical trial. SETTING: Clinical research center. PATIENTS: Twenty-two adult patients with SCD who received one of two nonmyeloablative allogeneic HSCT regimens: alemtuzumab and total body irradiation (Alem-TBI) or pentostatin, cyclophosphamide, alemtuzumab, and total body irradiation (Pento-Cy-Alem-TBI). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Alemtuzumab serum concentrations, absolute lymphocyte counts, T-cell (CD3), and myeloid (CD14/15) chimerism were collected at distinct time points and analyzed. A semi-mechanistic PK population model was built to understand inter-individual differences in pharmacology. Alemtuzumab was detectable up to 28 days post-HSCT. The mean alemtuzumab level 7 days after transplant for patients on Alem-TBI was 818 ng/ml, significantly lower than the mean level of 1502 ng/ml for patients on Pento-Cy-Alem-TBI (p < 0.001), but this difference decreased as time progressed. The clearance of alemtuzumab was linear, and the half-life was longer in the Pento-Cy-Alem-TBI group (average half-life = 61.1 h) compared to the Alem-TBI group (average half-life = 44.1 h) (p < 0.001). The CD3 chimerism at 2 and 4 months after transplant positively correlated with alemtuzumab levels collected on day 14 after transplant (R2  = 0.40 and p = 0.004 at 2 months, R2  = 0.36 and p = 0.005 at 4 months), but this significance was lost by 6 months after HSCT. No correlation was seen between alemtuzumab levels and CD14/15 chimerism. CONCLUSION: Between 2 and 4 months after transplant, higher alemtuzumab levels measured 14 days after transplant correlated with patients having better engraftment, suggesting more lymphodepletion may be needed to reduce graft failure in these two non-myeloablative matched related donor HSCT regimens.

32147065	Incorporating integrative medicine and patient preferences into a pilot interdisciplinary sickle cell wellness clinic.	OBJECTIVE: Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is an inherited blood disorder that includes acute pain episodes and chronic pain that can dramatically impact quality of life and goal-achievement. Our staff had limited success in connecting families with the Pain, Palliative Care and Integrative Medicine Clinic (PPCIM) to receive specialized skills for pain management. We created a partnership between Hematology and PPCIM to provide SCD patients/families with needed resources. DESIGN/SETTING: In 2016, key stakeholders collaborated to create a Sickle Cell Wellness Clinic (SCWC) clinic to provide families access to integrative medicine and wellness strategies. Design/structure, based on family focus group data and staff expertise, included a half-day, 7-discipline clinic housed in the PPCIM space. Patients with SCD, ages 8-20, learned strategies in an effort to improve health care utilization and increase overall quality of life. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES/RESULTS: Feedback from two successful pilot clinics in 2017 was incorporated into the formal roll-out of SCWC in 2018. SCWCs continued monthly for one year, serving a total of 20 families post-pilot. SCD patients increased follow-up appointment engagement in the PPCIM clinic following SCWC and reported high levels of satisfaction with their healthcare experience. CONCLUSIONS: It is feasible to run a multidisciplinary clinic focused on pain management, coping skills, and healthy living with SCD. Providers benefited from the opportunity to collaborate with other disciplines. Patient and family feedback was positive, highlighted benefits of being introduced to new modalities, and reported advantages of meeting other patients/families in a new setting.
36097125	Genetic modulation of anemia severity, hemolysis level, and hospitalization rate in Angolan children with Sickle Cell Anemia.	BACKGROUND: Sickle Cell Anemia (SCA) is a genetic disease caused by the c.20 A > T mutation in HBB gene, generally characterized by sickle erythrocytes, chronic hemolytic anemia, and vaso-occlusive events. This study aimed to investigate genetic modulators of anemia severity, chronic hemolytic rate, and clinical manifestations in pediatric SCA patients from Angola, where the disease is a severe public health problem. METHODS AND RESULTS: The study was conducted on 200 SCA children living in Luanda or Caxito province. Their clinical phenotype was collected from patients' hospital records. Hematological and biochemical phenotypes were characterized in steady state condition. Twelve polymorphic regions in VCAM1, CD36 and NOS3 genes were genotyped using PCR, RFLP, and Sanger sequencing. CD36 gene promoter variants showed a significant impact on anemia severity. Particularly, the rs1413661_C allele was associated with lower hemoglobin levels, and increased number of hospitalizations and transfusions. This is the first report associating this SNP with SCA phenotypic heterogeneity. Moreover, the rs1041163_C allele in VCAM1 was associated with lower LDH levels; inversely the rs2070744_C allele in NOS3 was related with higher LDH levels and number of hospitalizations, being a risk factor for increased hemolytic rate. CONCLUSION: This study highlights, for the first time in the Angolan population, the importance of the genetic modifiers of vascular cell adhesion and nitric oxide metabolism in SCA pediatric phenotypic variability.

37287128	Enhanced IgG immune response to COVID-19 vaccination in patients with sickle cell disease.	Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) are considered to be immunocompromised, yet data on the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in SCD is limited. We investigated anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG titres and overall neutralizing activity in 201 adults with SCD and demographically matched non-SCD controls. Unexpectedly, patients with SCD generate a more robust and durable COVID-19 vaccine IgG response compared to matched controls, though the neutralizing activity remained similar across both cohorts. These findings suggest that patients with SCD achieve a similar antibody response following COVID-19 vaccination compared to the general population, with implications for optimal vaccination strategies for patients with SCD.
37688519	Molecular and environmental contributors to neurological complications in sickle cell disease.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited hemoglobinopathy in which affected hemoglobin polymerizes under hypoxic conditions resulting in red cell distortion and chronic hemolytic anemia. SCD affects millions of people worldwide, primarily in Sub-Saharan Africa and the Indian subcontinent. Due to vaso-occlusion of sickled red cells within the microvasculature, SCD affects virtually every organ system and causes significant morbidity and early mortality. The neurological complications of SCD are particularly devastating and diverse, ranging from overt stroke to covert cerebral injury, including silent cerebral infarctions and blood vessel tortuosity. However, even individuals without evidence of neuroanatomical changes in brain imaging have evidence of cognitive deficits compared to matched healthy controls likely due to chronic cerebral hypoxemia and neuroinflammation. In this review, we first examined the biological contributors to SCD-related neurological complications and then discussed the equally important socioenvironmental contributors. We then discuss the evidence for neuroprotection from the two primary disease-modifying therapies, chronic monthly blood transfusions and hydroxyurea, and end with several experimental therapies designed to specifically target these complications.

31794569	Severe childhood anemia and emergency blood transfusion in Gadarif Hospital, eastern Sudan.	BACKGROUND: Anemia is a major cause of global morbidity and mortality, particularly among children. Management of anemia depends on causes and severity of anemia. However blood transfusion is a lifesaving intervention in severe and life-threatening anemia. There are no published data on blood transfusion for anemia in Sudan. METHODS: A descriptive study was conducted in Gadarif Hospital in eastern Sudan during 1 August, 2017 to 31 March, 2018. Consecutive children who presented at the emergency room with an indication for blood transfusion were enrolled in the study. A detailed history was gathered from all patients. Physical examinations, including vital signs, were performed. The World Health Organization guidelines for blood transfusion were followed. RESULTS: During the study period, a total of 1800 children were admitted to the emergency pediatric ward in Gadarif Hospital and were assessed for anemia, 513 (28.5%) were anemic and 141 (7.8%) had severe anemia. Three hundred anemic children received blood transfusion. The median (interquartile) of the age of the 300 children who received blood transfusion was 4.2 4.2(2.0-9.0) years. A total of 148 (49.3%) of the children were boys and 151 (50.3%) were younger than 5 years. The diagnoses associated with the order for blood transfusion were sickle cell disease (129, 43.0%), active bleeding (58, 19.3%), malaria (50, 16.7%), visceral leishmaniasis (25, 8.3%), severe acute malnutrition (16, 5.30%), snake bite (11, 3.7%), sepsis (5, 1.7%), and others. Two hundred eighty-five (95.0%) children improved, nine children were discharged against medical advice, and six (2.0%) children died. CONCLUSION: There is a high burden of anemia in eastern Sudan. Sickle cell disease, malaria, and visceral leishmaniasis are the main causes of anemia in this region. Further research on blood transfusion is needed.
38469996	Description of a national, multi-center registry of patients with sickle cell disease and SARS-CoV-2 infection: Data from the Pediatric COVID-19 United States Registry.	Children with sickle cell disease (SCD) are at risk of complications from viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2. We present the clinical characteristics and outcomes of pediatric patients with SCD from the Pediatric COVID-19 United States Registry who developed acute COVID-19 due to SARS-CoV-2 infection (n = 259) or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C; n = 4). Nearly half of hospitalized children with SCD and SARS-CoV-2 infection required supplemental oxygen, though children with SCD had fewer intensive care (ICU) admissions compared to the general pediatric and immunocompromised populations. All registry patients with both SCD and MIS-C required ICU admission. Children with SCD are at risk of severe disease with SARS-CoV-2 infection, highlighting the importance of vaccination in this vulnerable population.
37965881	Dermatologic complications in pediatric patients after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for sickle cell disease.	Dermatologic complications are common following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, but dermatologic complications among pediatric patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for the treatment of sickle cell disease have been poorly characterized. In this case series of 17 patients (<21 years old) with sickle cell disease who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, 16 (94.1%) experienced one or more dermatologic complications after transplant, with the most common complications including acute or chronic mucocutaneous graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (34.1% of complications), skin eruptions of unknown origin (15.9% of complications), infections (15.9% of complications), and chemotherapy-related pigmentary changes (11.4% of complications). Patients who developed acute or chronic skin GVHD were significantly older at the time of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. These findings highlight the need to closely monitor for dermatologic complications in pediatric patients who undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for sickle cell disease and underscore the importance of involving dermatology early on when skin complications occur, although further research with a larger multicenter study could help clarify the risk for dermatologic complications and help identify potential ways to mitigate this risk.
34089222	A scoping review of transition interventions for young adults with sickle cell disease.	Standardized programming for individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD) transitioning from pediatric to adult-centered care does not currently exist, resulting in high rates of mortality and morbidity. This scoping review examines and evaluates the current literature on SCD transition programs and interventions. Eligible studies described an existing program for individuals with SCD aged 12-29 years preparing to transition. The Evidence Project risk-of-bias tool was used to assess article quality. We identified 30 eligible articles, of which, only two were randomized controlled trials. Many studies have incomplete reports of feasibility information, such as completion rates, patient characteristics, and attrition; all studies were limited to a single institution; and most studies were rated high for risk of bias. Progress has been made in designing and gathering initial evaluation data for SCD transition programs; however, there is a need for higher quality studies, consistent assessment, and better dissemination of programs.
35865842	COVID- 19 and sickle cell disease: autopsy findings of three deaths at the 37 Military Hospital, Accra, Ghana.	The main pathological effects of COVID-19 infection have been reported to occur in the lungs, with the most pronounced manifestation being reported as Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) with thromboembolic phenomena. Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is a common genetic disorder present in 2% of newborns in Ghana. The complications of SCD include Vaso-Occlusive Crisis and Acute Chest Syndrome, which primarily manifest in the lungs. The effects of SCD on the progression of COVID-19 have not been extensively and clearly documented in literature. The objective was to describe the clinical and pathological findings in three SCD patients who died of COVID-19 related complications. A complete autopsy was performed on each of the three SCD patients who were presumed to have COVID-19. Lung swabs were subsequently taken and tested for SARS-CoV-2. The differences in histopathological findings of the three cases were highlighted and correlation with clinical findings was also done. Lung histopathological findings for all three cases were consistent with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)/ Diffuse Alveolar Damage (DAD) described for infections with COVID-19 and lung swabs tested for SARS-CoV-2 by real time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (rRT-PCR) were positive. Though SCD has been reported not to adversely affect an individual s chance of worse outcome when infected with COVID-19, our findings suggest otherwise. We suggest that SCD may be an important co-morbidity that needs to be considered in COVID-19 patients and when present needs to be considered as an adverse risk for poor outcomes. Also, post-discharge anti-coagulation and monitoring should be encouraged. More autopsies are required to fully understand the pathogenesis of COVID-19 in SCD patients.
38786024	CRISPR-Based Gene Therapies: From Preclinical to Clinical Treatments.	In recent years, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) and CRISPR-associated (Cas) protein have emerged as a revolutionary gene editing tool to treat inherited disorders affecting different organ systems, such as blood and muscles. Both hematological and neuromuscular genetic disorders benefit from genome editing approaches but face different challenges in their clinical translation. The ability of CRISPR/Cas9 technologies to modify hematopoietic stem cells ex vivo has greatly accelerated the development of genetic therapies for blood disorders. In the last decade, many clinical trials were initiated and are now delivering encouraging results. The recent FDA approval of Casgevy, the first CRISPR/Cas9-based drug for severe sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia, represents a significant milestone in the field and highlights the great potential of this technology. Similar preclinical efforts are currently expanding CRISPR therapies to other hematologic disorders such as primary immunodeficiencies. In the neuromuscular field, the versatility of CRISPR/Cas9 has been instrumental for the generation of new cellular and animal models of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), offering innovative platforms to speed up preclinical development of therapeutic solutions. Several corrective interventions have been proposed to genetically restore dystrophin production using the CRISPR toolbox and have demonstrated promising results in different DMD animal models. Although these advances represent a significant step forward to the clinical translation of CRISPR/Cas9 therapies to DMD, there are still many hurdles to overcome, such as in vivo delivery methods associated with high viral vector doses, together with safety and immunological concerns. Collectively, the results obtained in the hematological and neuromuscular fields emphasize the transformative impact of CRISPR/Cas9 for patients affected by these debilitating conditions. As each field suffers from different and specific challenges, the clinical translation of CRISPR therapies may progress differentially depending on the genetic disorder. Ongoing investigations and clinical trials will address risks and limitations of these therapies, including long-term efficacy, potential genotoxicity, and adverse immune reactions. This review provides insights into the diverse applications of CRISPR-based technologies in both preclinical and clinical settings for monogenic blood disorders and muscular dystrophy and compare advances in both fields while highlighting current trends, difficulties, and challenges to overcome.
35118643	Neurocognitive risk in sickle cell disease: Utilizing neuropsychology services to manage cognitive symptoms and functional limitations.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited blood disorder that is associated with developmental delays and neurocognitive deficits. This review details key findings related to neurocognitive outcomes for children and adults with emphasis on the impact of neurological correlates and disease severity. Associations between neurocognition, demographic factors and social determinants of health are also reviewed. Emerging literature has reported on the neurocognitive impact of SCD in children and adolescents in Africa and Europe, including children from immigrant communities. Neurocognitive deficits are linked to poor functional outcomes, including transition from paediatric to adult care, medication adherence and unemployment. Integrating neuropsychology into multidisciplinary care for individuals with SCD can assist with identification and management of neurocognitive concerns, intervention development, individualized care plan development and continued multidisciplinary research.

33155319	Clinical outcomes following bone marrow transplantation in patients with sickle cell disease: A cohort study of US Medicaid enrollees.	OBJECTIVES: Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is currently the only curative therapy available for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), but clinical outcomes in routine care are not well understood. We describe the rates of vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs), transplant complications, and mortality in SCD patients after BMT. METHODS: A cohort study of SCD patients who underwent BMT was designed using US Medicaid claims data (2000-2013). RESULTS: A total of 204 SCD patients undergoing BMT were identified with a mean (SD) age of 10.6 (7.3) years, with 52.9% male and 67.6% African American. The overall VOC rate was 0.99 per person-year (95% CI: 0.91-1.07) over a median follow-up time of 2.1 years (IQR: 0.8-4.3 years). A total of 138 (67.6%) remained free of VOCs. The mortality rate was 1.7 (95% CI: 0.9-3.1) per 100 person-years, transplant-related complications occurred among 113 (55.4%) patients with an incidence rate of 38.2 (95% CI: 31.7-45.9) per 100 person-years, while 47 (23%) patients had GvHD with an incidence rate of 8.0 (95% CI: 6.0-10.7) per 100 person-years. CONCLUSION: Two thirds of the BMT recipients remained VOC-free over 2 years of follow-up, but transplant-related complications, including GvHD occurred with high frequency. This highlights a continuing unmet need for alternative curative interventions in SCD.

35210461	Childhood stroke.	Stroke is an important cause of neurological morbidity in children; most survivors have permanent neurological deficits that affect the remainder of their life. Stroke in childhood, the focus of this Primer, is distinguished from perinatal stroke, defined as stroke before 29 days of age, because of its unique pathogenesis reflecting the maternal-fetal unit. Although approximately 15% of strokes in adults are haemorrhagic, half of incident strokes in children are haemorrhagic and half are ischaemic. The causes of childhood stroke are distinct from those in adults. Urgent brain imaging is essential to confirm the stroke diagnosis and guide decisions about hyperacute therapies. Secondary stroke prevention strongly depends on the underlying aetiology. While the past decade has seen substantial advances in paediatric stroke research, the quality of evidence for interventions, such as the rapid reperfusion therapies that have revolutionized arterial ischaemic stroke care in adults, remains low. Substantial time delays in diagnosis and treatment continue to challenge best possible care. Effective primary stroke prevention strategies in children with sickle cell disease represent a major success, yet barriers to implementation persist. The multidisciplinary members of the International Pediatric Stroke Organization are coordinating global efforts to tackle these challenges and improve the outcomes in children with cerebrovascular disease.
36516084	Outcomes following posttransplant viral-specific T-cell therapy in patients with sickle cell disease.	Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is increasingly used as a curative approach for sickle cell disease (SCD). With the risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), especially in the HLA-mismatched donors, intense immunosuppression is required leading to an increased risk of viral infection. Post-HSCT, adoptive transfer of virus-specific T cell (VSTs) therapies have not been well-studied in SCD patients. Here, we report the outcomes of patients with SCD at a single-center who received VSTs post-transplant to prevent or treat virus infections. Thirteen patients who received HSCT from HLA-matched (n=9) or mismatched (n=4) donors for SCD were treated with a total of 15 VST products for the treatment or prophylaxis of multiple viruses (cytomegalovirus, ebstein barr virus, adenovirus, BK virus, human herpes virus 6 +/- human parainfluenza virus 3). Of the patients evaluated, 46.2% (n=6)) received VSTs as treatment of virus infection. Eighty percent of patients with active viremia (n=4/5) achieved remission of at least 1 target virus. Seven additional patients (53.8%) received VSTs prophylactically and 6/7 (85.7%) remained virus-free post-infusion. No immediate infusion-related toxicities occurred, and severe de novo acute GVHD occurred in only 2 (15.4%) patients. Given the good safety profile, high-rate of clinical responses and sustained remissions when administered with standard anti-viral treatments, the routine use of VSTs post-HSCT as prophylaxis or treatment may improve the overall safety of transplant for patients with SCD.
36694913	Preschool Pain Management Program for Young Children with Sickle Cell Disease: A Pre-Post Feasibility Study.	OBJECTIVE: Vaso-occlusive pain crises in sickle cell disease (SCD) often begin in early childhood. We developed an online pain management intervention to teach caregivers of preschool-aged children with SCD behavioral pain management strategies. The feasibility study goals were to examine response to recruitment, barriers to participation, engagement, acceptability and perceived usefulness of the intervention, and suitability of outcome measures. METHODS: Caregivers of children aged 2.0-5.9 years with access to text messaging and a device to access online videos were recruited from a Southeastern outpatient hematology clinic for a 12-week intervention consisting of pain management videos. Videos taught caregivers behavioral pain management strategies and adaptive responses to pain. Workbook activities helped tailor strategies to their child. Caregivers completed process measures as well as baseline and follow-up measures of pain catastrophizing (Pain Catastrophizing Scale-Parent Report) and responses to their child's pain (Adult Response to Children's Symptoms). RESULTS: Fifty percent (10 of 20) of eligible parents enrolled. Caregivers partially completed (N = 6), completed (N = 3), or did not engage (N = 1) in the intervention. Caregivers who engaged in the program reported implementing the pain management strategies. The intervention was rated as high quality, relevant, and useful. Measures of pain catastrophizing and responses to their child's pain appeared sensitive to change. CONCLUSIONS: The intervention to promote adaptive coping to pain was acceptable and feasible for caregivers though we found barriers to delivering the intervention to parents. Evaluation of a modified version of the program is indicated to assess implementation issues and effectiveness.
37426651	Case report: Successful treatment with daratumumab for pure red cell aplasia in a patient with mixed lymphoid chimerism after ABO-mismatched stem cell transplant for sickle cell disease.	Pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) is a serious complication after ABO-mismatched allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Following HSCT, persistent anti-donor isohemagglutinins against donor ABO antigens are considered the immunological cause of PRCA. Patients with post-transplant PRCA are at risk for graft rejection and prolonged red blood cell transfusion dependency. No standard treatment exists. Recently however, the anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody daratumumab has been reported to be an effective treatment for post-transplant PRCA in patients with complete donor chimerism. Here, we describe the first case of PRCA in a patient with mixed lymphoid patient/donor chimerism that was successfully treated with daratumumab. This is also the first report of a transplant recipient with sickle cell disease who was treated with this relatively new approach. Fourteen months post-transplantation and twelve months after treatment with daratumumab, our patient has a normal complete blood count and the anti-donor isohemagglutinins remain undetectable despite mixed lymphoid chimerism. Mixed chimerism is a common manifestation in adult patients with sickle cell disease transplanted with non-myeloablative conditioning and a matched sibling donor. The application of non-myeloablative HSCT for patients with sickle cell disease is steadily increasing. Therefore, the incidence of PRCA in this setting might also increase. As the risk of graft rejection due to PRCA can be especially high in patients with mixed chimerism, clinicians should be aware that daratumumab can be an effective treatment in the setting of mixed chimerism.
35135795	Sideroblastic anaemia in a patient with sickle cell disease.	Sideroblastic anaemia is a rare condition. We report a unique case of concomitant sideroblastic anaemia in a patient with sickle cell disease with long-standing blood transfusion history. Due to a low prevalence of sideroblastic anaemia, the diagnosis of sideroblastic anaemia is often difficult, especially when coexisting with common types of anaemia, including sickle cell disease. This case highlights the detrimental effects of anchoring bias. Rare causes of refractory anaemia should be considered in patients with haemoglobin disorders as the therapeutic approaches for these conditions are different. High suspicion on the part of the clinician and low threshold for workup of anaemia often aids in the diagnosis of coexisting conditions such as sideroblastic anaemia. Early diagnosis and treatment of sideroblastic anaemia improves patient outcomes and prevents long-term complications.
36100552	Transfusion support for patients with sickle cell disease.	Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion is an essential treatment for many patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), whose RBCs express hemoglobin S (HbS), a mutated form of hemoglobin A (HbA). Transfusion goals include increasing blood oxygen carrying capacity and decreasing the relative amount of HbS to HbA to mitigate vaso-occlusion in small blood vessels. In situations where correction of severe anemia and reduction in HbS may be achieved without removal of RBCs, simple transfusion may be utilized. Partial manual RBC exchange, which removes blood containing HbS by phlebotomy and replaces with donor blood transfusion sequentially allows for larger changes in the ratio of HbS to HbA when compared to simple transfusion. Automated RBC exchange by apheresis is useful in situations where a rapid and drastic HbS reduction is indicated. Vascular access is an important consideration for transfusion. Although peripheral access may be sufficient, central venous catheters and implantable venous access devices may be necessary for adequate access over time. Blood bank considerations include adequate RBC antigen matching to mitigate the risk of RBC alloimmunization, of which patients with SCD are at risk of developing. Transfusion may be utilized in efforts to intervene in the evolution of potentially life-threatening complications of SCD such as acute stroke, severe acute anemia and acute chest syndrome. Transfusion is also useful in several non-acute settings, such as stroke prevention, pregnancy, pre-surgery, and transfusion support for curative therapies. Individualized treatment plans are an essential component of patient care. Continuous evaluation of clinical indications and evolution of guidelines will continue to optimize care for patients with SCD.
33228943	Pulmonary Manifestations of Hematologic and Oncologic Diseases in Children.	Pulmonary complications are common in children with hematologic or oncologic diseases, and many experience long-term effects even after the primary disease has been cured. This article reviews pulmonary complications in children with cancer, after hematopoietic stem cell transplant, and caused by sickle cell disease and discusses their management.
33916502	Effects of Genotypes and Treatment on Oxygenscan Parameters in Sickle Cell Disease.	(1) Background: The aim of the present study was to compare oxygen gradient ektacytometry parameters between sickle cell patients of different genotypes (SS, SC, and S/beta+) or under different treatments (hydroxyurea or chronic red blood cell exchange). (2) Methods: Oxygen gradient ektacytometry was performed in 167 adults and children at steady state. In addition, five SS patients had oxygenscan measurements at steady state and during an acute complication requiring hospitalization. (3) Results: Red blood cell (RBC) deformability upon deoxygenation (EImin) and in normoxia (EImax) was increased, and the susceptibility of RBC to sickle upon deoxygenation was decreased in SC patients when compared to untreated SS patients older than 5 years old. SS patients under chronic red blood cell exchange had higher EImin and EImax and lower susceptibility of RBC to sickle upon deoxygenation compared to untreated SS patients, SS patients younger than 5 years old, and hydroxyurea-treated SS and SC patients. The susceptibility of RBC to sickle upon deoxygenation was increased in the five SS patients during acute complication compared to steady state, although the difference between steady state and acute complication was variable from one patient to another. (4) Conclusions: The present study demonstrates that oxygen gradient ektacytometry parameters are affected by sickle cell disease (SCD) genotype and treatment.
33688634	MOLECULAR MEDICINE: Found in Translation.	Studies of the major hemoglobin disorders, beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease (SCD), have laid a foundation for molecular medicine. While enormous progress has been made in understanding gene structure and regulation, translating molecular insights to therapy for the many individuals affected with these disorders has been challenging. Advances in three activities have recently converged to bring novel genetic and potentially curative treatments to clinical trials. First, improved lentiviral vectors for gene transfer into hematopoietic stem cells have revived somatic gene therapy for blood disorders. Second, elucidation of regulatory factors and mechanisms that control the normal developmental switch from fetal to adult hemoglobin has provided a route to reactivation of the fetal form for therapy. Third, revolutionary methods of gene engineering permit molecular insights to be leveraged for patients. Here I review how the promise of molecular medicine to bring transformative treatments to the clinical arena is finally being realized.
32812667	Automated exchange compared to manual and simple blood transfusion attenuates rise in ferritin level after 1 year of regular blood transfusion therapy in chronically transfused children with sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Optimal strategies for regular blood transfusion therapy are not well defined in sickle cell disease (SCD). This analysis tested the hypothesis that in the first of year of regular transfusions, when chelation therapy use is minimal, automated exchange transfusion would be the superior method for attenuating the rise in ferritin levels compared to simple and manual exchange transfusions. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The Silent Cerebral Infarct Multi-Center Clinical Trial randomly allocated children with SCD and silent cerebral infarcts to receive standard care or regular transfusions with a target pre-transfusion HbS concentration <= 30% and minimum hemoglobin level > 9.0 g/dL. Participants with at least nine transfusions and sufficient ferritin testing in the first year of the trial were included in a planned secondary analysis. Ferritin levels by the end of the first study year were compared between participants receiving automatic exchange transfusion, manual exchange transfusion, and simple transfusion. RESULTS: A total of 83 participants were analyzed. During the first year of the study, 75.9% of the participants had >80% of transfusions via one transfusion method. At baseline no significant differences in ferritin levels were observed in the three transfusion groups (p = 0.1). After 1 year of transfusions the median (interquartile range) ferritin levels in the simple transfusion (n = 40), manual exchange transfusion (n = 34) and automatic exchange transfusion (n = 9) groups were 1800 ng/mL (1426-2204 ng/mL), 1530 ng/mL (1205-1805 ng/mL), and 355 ng/mL (179-579 ng/mL), respectively (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Automated exchange transfusion, when compared to other transfusion methods, is the optimal transfusion strategy for attenuating increase in ferritin levels in children with SCD.
35785794	Sickle cell anaemia and severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria: a secondary analysis of the Transfusion and Treatment of African Children Trial (TRACT).	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell anaemia (SCA) has historically been associated with high levels of childhood mortality in Africa. Although malaria has a major contribution to this mortality, to date, the clinical pathology of malaria among children with SCA has been poorly described. We aimed to explore the relationship between SCA and Plasmodium falciparum malaria in further detail by investigating the burden and severity of malaria infections among children recruited with severe anaemia to the TRACT trial of blood transfusion in Africa. METHODS: This study is a post-hoc secondary analysis of the TRACT trial data, conducted after trial completion. TRACT was an open-label, multicentre, factorial, randomised controlled trial enrolling children aged 2 months to 12 years who presented with severe anaemia (haemoglobin <6 0 g/dL) to four hospitals in Africa. This secondary analysis is restricted to Uganda, where the birth prevalence of SCA is approximately 1% and malaria transmission is high. Children were classified as normal (HbAA), heterozygous (HbAS), or homozygous (HbSS; SCA) for the rs334 A T sickle mutation in HBB following batch-genotyping by PCR at the end of the trial. To avoid confounding from SCA-specific medical interventions, we considered children with an existing diagnosis of SCA (known SCA) separately from those diagnosed at the end of the trial (unknown SCA). The outcomes considered in this secondary analysis were measures of P falciparum parasite burden, features of severe malaria, and mortality at day 28 in malaria-positive children. FINDINGS: Between Sept 17, 2014, and May 15, 2017, 3944 children with severe anaemia were enrolled into the TRACT trial. 3483 children from Uganda were considered in this secondary analysis. Overall, 1038 (30%) of 3483 Ugandan children had SCA. 1815 (78%) of 2321 children without SCA (HbAA) tested positive for P falciparum malaria, whereas the prevalence was significantly lower in children with SCA (347 [33%] of 1038; p<0 0001). Concentrations of plasma P falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2), a marker of the total burden of malaria parasites within an individual, were significantly lower in children with either known SCA (median 8 ng/mL; IQR 0-57) or unknown SCA (7 ng/mL; 0-50) than in HbAA children (346 ng/mL; 21-2121; p<0 0001). In contrast to HbAA children, few HbSS children presented with classic features of severe and complicated malaria, but both the frequency and severity of anaemia were higher in HbSS children. We found no evidence for increased mortality at day 28 in those with SCA compared with those without SCA overall (hazard ratios 1 07 [95% CI 0 31-3 76] for known SCA and 0 67 [0 15-2 90] for unknown SCA). INTERPRETATION: The current study suggests that children with SCA are innately protected against classic severe malaria. However, it also shows that even low-level infections can precipitate severe anaemic crises that would likely prove fatal without rapid access to blood transfusion services.

33500096	Hemochromatosis in Two Female Olive Baboons (Papio anubis).	This report describes hemochromatosis associated with chronic parenteral iron dextran administration in 2 female olive baboons (Papio anubis). These baboons were enrolled on an experimental protocol that induced and maintained anemia by periodic phlebotomy for use in studying potential treatments for sickle cell anemia. The 2 baboons both presented with clinical signs consistent with iron overload, including decreased appetite, weight loss, elevated liver enzymes, and hepatosplenomegaly. Histopathologic findings supported a morphologic diagnosis of systemic hemosiderosis, as evidenced by the overwhelming presence of iron in the reticuloendothelial system and liver after the application of Prussian blue stain. This finding, combined with the clinical presentation, lead to a final diagnosis of hemochromatosis. This case report suggests that providing anemic patients with chronic parenteral iron supplementation in the absence of iron deficiency can result in iatrogenic iron overload and subsequent systemic toxicity. Furthermore, these subjects may present with hemochromatosis and its associated clinical signs many years after cessation of iron supplementation.

36485131	Organ function indications and potential improvements following curative therapy for sickle cell disease.	Curative therapies for sickle cell disease include allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and gene-modified autologous stem cell transplantation. HSCT has been used for 30 years with success measured by engraftment, symptom control, graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) risk, organ toxicity, and immune reconstitution. While human leukocyte antigen-matched sibling donor (MSD) transplants have excellent outcomes, alternate donor transplants (unrelated/haploidentical) are just beginning to overcome GVHD and engraftment hurdles to match MSD. Gene therapy, a newly developed treatment, is undergoing careful evaluation in many trials with varying approaches. The risk/benefit ratio to the patient in relation to outcomes, toxicities, and mortality risk drives eligibility for curative interventions. Consequently, eligibility criteria for MSD transplants can be less stringent, especially in the young. Posttransplant outcome analysis after the "cure" with respect to organ function recovery is essential. While established damage such as stroke is irreversible, transplant can help stabilize (pulmonary function), prevent further deterioration (stroke), improve (neurocognition), and protect unaffected organs. Tracking organ functions postintervention uniformly between clinical trials and for adequate duration is essential to answer safety and efficacy questions related to curative therapies. Age-appropriate application/outcome analyses of such therapies will be the ultimate goal in overcoming this disease.
36637364	Transfusion-transmitted babesiosis in a patient with sickle cell disease undergoing chronic red cell exchange.	BACKGROUND: Prior to laboratory-based blood donor screening for Babesia, transfusion-transmitted babesiosis (TTB) was a leading infectious risk to the blood supply in the United States. CASE REPORT: A 30-year-old man with sickle cell disease (SCD) who had been on a chronic automated red cell exchange (RCE) regimen since childhood, presented approximately 2 months after an RCE, with fever, neck pain, and photophobia. Meningitis was excluded, and he was discharged. He presented again 2 days later with persistent fever, chills, headache, fatigue, and loss of appetite. RESULTS: On examination, the patient was febrile but hemodynamically stable. Intra-erythrocytic inclusions were identified on a peripheral blood smear (<0.5%). B. microti IgM and IgG titers were >1:320 (Reference <1:20) >1:1024 (Reference <1:64), respectively. B. microti was confirmed by nucleic acid testing. The patient lived in a Babesia endemic state but had no risk factors for tick-borne acquisition. Of the 65 units he received in the preceding 6 months, 58 had been screened for Babesia. One of the donors of the 7 untested units was B. microti seropositive (titer 1:128; Reference 1: 64). The donor was asymptomatic and resided in a state in which Babesia screening was not required. He reported traveling in the year before his donation. CONCLUSION: Although rare, TTB is still possible despite regional screening, underscoring the need for provider vigilance and education, especially in non-endemic areas. Patients with SCD are particularly vulnerable given their high frequency of transfusion and complex needs requiring blood procurement from states where Babesia screening is not mandatory.
31619285	Prevalence of sickle cell disease and sickle cell trait among children admitted to Al Fashir Teaching Hospital North Darfur State, Sudan.	OBJECTIVE: It is estimated that 50% to 90% of infants born with (SCA) in sub-Saharan Africa die before 5 years old. Northern Darfur State at western Sudan region has a multiethnic population with a high frequency of sickle cell anaemia, but little about it is published. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of sickle cell anaemia among children admitted to Al Fashir Teaching Hospital in Al Fashir, Northern Darfur State, Sudan. RESULTS: The prevalence of sickle cell disease by haemoglobin electrophoresis among these 400 children patients was 59 (14.8%). Sickle cell trait patients were 11.3% and Sickle cell disease positive patients were 3.5%. Individuals with SCA have consistently low blood Hb concentration, normal MCV and high mean WBC's. Individuals with sickle cell trait had haematological parameters near to those of normal individuals.

36129238	Outcomes of patients who underwent treatment for anti-HLA donor-specific antibodies before receiving a haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplant.	Pediatric and adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients who receive many blood product transfusions, such as individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD), severe aplastic anemia (SAA) or indolent hematologic malignancies, are at high risk for developing donor-specific antibodies (DSA). DSAs with mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) greater than 5000 have been associated with significant graft failure, but lower MFI values between 2000 and 5000 may result in poor graft function after hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT). Desensitization strategies have been developed to reduce the DSA burden in HCT recipients before graft infusion, but the experience with these strategies in the pediatric and AYA populations is not well described in the literature. Here, we describe our experience with successful desensitization by using a combination of treatment strategies in five pediatric and AYA patients, including a novel use of daratumumab in a young adult patient who had refractory DSAs and had suffered serious side effects from conventional desensitization strategies. The presence of elevated DSAs in pediatric and AYA recipients of a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-mismatched haploidentical HCT can be overcome by a multipronged treatment strategy.
32629539	Red blood cell exchange to avoid intubating a COVID-19 positive patient with sickle cell disease?	As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to claim lives across the globe, insufficient data exists regarding the optimal treatment. It is well known that patients 55 years of age or older and patients with certain chronic diseases are at higher risk of severe illness, including acute respiratory distress syndrome and death. A potentially fatal pulmonary complication of sickle cell disease, acute chest syndrome, can be precipitated by acute infections, including respiratory viruses. We report the case of a patient with sickle cell disease (HbSC) who developed COVID-19 pneumonia and acute chest syndrome who was treated with emergent red blood cell exchange in order to avoid endotracheal intubation.
35972175	Preoperative Transfusion and Surgical Outcomes for Children with Sickle Cell Disease.	BACKGROUND: Current guidelines recommending preoperative transfusion to a hemoglobin level of 9 to 10 g/dL for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) are based on imperfect evidence. The benefit of preoperative transfusion in children specifically is not known. This study aimed to evaluate whether preoperative RBC transfusion is associated with different rates of sickle cell crisis and surgical complications, compared with no preoperative transfusion, among children with SCD undergoing common abdominal operations. STUDY DESIGN: The NSQIP-Pediatrics database (2013 to 2019) was queried. Patients who underwent cholecystectomy, splenectomy, or appendectomy with a preoperative Hct level of less than 30% were included. The primary outcome was 30-day readmission for sickle cell crisis. Secondary outcomes were 30-day surgical complications and hospital length of stay. Propensity score matching methods were used to obtain two statistically similar cohorts of patients comprised of those who were preoperatively transfused and those who were not. RESULTS: Among 357 SCD patients, 200 (56%) received preoperative transfusion. In the matched cohort of 278 patients (139 per group), there was no statistically significant difference in 30-day readmission for sickle cell crisis in the transfused and non-transfused groups (5.8% vs 7.2%, p = 0.80). The rate of 30-day surgical complications did not differ between matched groups (10.8% vs 9.4%, p = 0.84). Subgroups defined by presenting Hct levels of 27.3% or greater or less than 27.3%, American Society of Anesthesiologists classification, wound class, and index operation were not associated with an altered risk of sickle cell crisis or surgical complications after preoperative transfusion compared with no transfusion. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative transfusion for children with SCD undergoing semi-elective abdominal operations was not associated with improved outcomes. Prospective investigation is warranted to strengthen guidelines and minimize unnecessary perioperative transfusions in this population.
34014839	Multiple-ancestry genome-wide association study identifies 27 loci associated with measures of hemolysis following blood storage.	BackgroundThe evolutionary pressure of endemic malaria and other erythrocytic pathogens has shaped variation in genes encoding erythrocyte structural and functional proteins, influencing responses to hemolytic stress during transfusion and disease.MethodsWe sought to identify such genetic variants in blood donors by conducting a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 12,353 volunteer donors, including 1,406 African Americans, 1,306 Asians, and 945 Hispanics, whose stored erythrocytes were characterized by quantitative assays of in vitro osmotic, oxidative, and cold-storage hemolysis.ResultsGWAS revealed 27 significant loci (P < 5 x 10-8), many in candidate genes known to modulate erythrocyte structure, metabolism, and ion channels, including SPTA1, ALDH2, ANK1, HK1, MAPKAPK5, AQP1, PIEZO1, and SLC4A1/band 3. GWAS of oxidative hemolysis identified variants in genes encoding antioxidant enzymes, including GLRX, GPX4, G6PD, and SEC14L4 (Golgi-transport protein). Genome-wide significant loci were also tested for association with the severity of steady-state (baseline) in vivo hemolytic anemia in patients with sickle cell disease, with confirmation of identified SNPs in HBA2, G6PD, PIEZO1, AQP1, and SEC14L4.ConclusionsMany of the identified variants, such as those in G6PD, have previously been shown to impair erythrocyte recovery after transfusion, associate with anemia, or cause rare Mendelian human hemolytic diseases. Candidate SNPs in these genes, especially in polygenic combinations, may affect RBC recovery after transfusion and modulate disease severity in hemolytic diseases, such as sickle cell disease and malaria.
32921398	[Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant in children and adults with sickle cell disease: Indications and modalities].	Sickle cell disease is associated with severe complications and early mortality in adults. In children, hematopoietic stem cell transplant from HLA-identical sibling can stop the progression of the disease and leads to more than 95% long-term free survival without sickle cell disease. The aim of this workshop was to define indications and modalities of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant in children and adults with sickle cell disease. Patient and sibling HLA typing should be proposed, early in the course of the disease, when intensification therapies are required. Indications of transplant from HLA-identical sibling in children and adults are, cerebral vasculopathy, occurrence of vaso-occlusive events despite hydroxycarbamide, renal and hepatic diseases related to SCD, chronic anemia<7g/dL despite hydroxycarbamide, need to maintain transfusion programs longer than six months, and major transfusion difficulties related to red blood cell alloimmunization. In children with an HLA-identical sibling donor, we recommend a myeloablative conditioning regimen associating high dose busulfan, cyclophosphamide and ATG, considering the excellent results of this approach In patients over 15 years of age, we recommend the NIH approach consisting of a reduced intensity conditioning regimen by alemtuzumab, and 3Gy total body irradiation, followed by peripheral hematopoietic stem cells and post-transplant immunosuppression by sirolimus In the absence of HLA-identical sibling donor, there is no definitive data for preferring transplant from unrelated versus haplo-identical donors but we recommend to evaluate these approaches in prospective trials.
36924235	Severity and burden of sickle cell disease in France: a nationwide realworld study.	The burden of sickle cell disease (SCD) in France has been difficult to apprehend due to the paucity of reliable nationwide epidemiological data. We aimed to describe the epidemiology of SCD and evaluate its burden and costs. Patients with SCD and most severely affected patients were identified between 2012 and 2018 from the French National Health Data System database (SNDS, Systeme national des donnees de sante). Outcomes of interest included rates of acute and chronic complications, healthcare resource utilisation and associated costs, and were compared in subpopulations of patients before and after Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT), initiating hydroxyurea (HU) or a chronic transfusion program (CTP). Between 2012 and 2018, 22,619 patients with SCD were identified, among which 4,270 patients were defined as most severely affected. Rates of vaso-occlusion (VOC) episodes and acute chest syndrome (ACS) were 86.29 [95CI%: 85.75; 86.83] and 12.90 [95%CI: 12.69; 13.11] per 100 person-years in study population and 166.9 [95%CI: 165.4; 168.4] and 22.71 [95%CI: 22.16; 23.27] per 100 person-years in most severely affected patients. Median (Q1-Q3) annualised total costs were $5,073.63 (1,633.74-14,000.94) and $13,295.67 (5,754.67-26,385.23) in study population and most severely affected patients. Median annualised costs were 10 times lower after treatment intensification for HSCT ($29,011.75 vs $2,465.98, p.
33446428	Anxiety level and clinical course of patients with sickle cell disease during the COVID-19 outbreak.	OBJECTIVES: Besides infectious pneumonia and death risks, the COVID-19 pandemic has prompted negative psychological impacts on communities, especially on people with chronic diseases. We aimed to evaluate COVID-19 and sickle cell disease (SCD)-related experiences, and the clinical course during the outbreak, to measure anxiety levels of adolescent and young adult patients with homozygous SCD, to analyze the correlations between their COVID-19 experiences and anxiety levels and painful episodes. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 47 patients aged between 14 and 24 years responded to a descriptive instrument and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Clinical features requiring hospitalization for the same period (between March 10 and May 10) of two sequential years were compared. RESULTS: Sixty-six percent of the patients had at least one negative COVID-19 experience of dizziness, sleep disturbance, tonic immobility, appetite loss or nausea/abdominal distress. The number of negative COVID-19 experiences was correlated with the state anxiety score, the trait anxiety score, and the number of painful episodes (rho=0.552, P<0.001; rho=0.529, P<0.001; rho=0.448, P=0.002, respectively). Both median state anxiety and trait anxiety scores were below the cut-off scores indicating significant clinical symptoms. The number of hospitalizations requiring vaso-occlusive crisis management and blood/exchange transfusion were similar for the same period of two sequential years, 2019 and 2020. CONCLUSION: These descriptive and correlation findings are the first reported on COVID-19-related anxiety in SCD patients. To develop screening and support strategies for mental health needs in pandemic times, further SCD studies should be conducted.
35142256	Preconception care counselling among women with sickle cell anaemia in the south of Iran: a qualitative study based on social marketing model.	Pregnancy in women afflicted with sickle cell anaemia has certain adverse effects. The present research aimed to promote the quality of preconception care counselling programs. To do this, Hormozgan Province recruited 25 diseased women and five key informants. To acquire the necessary information, in-depth semi-structured interviews were undertaken. Graneheim's directions for guided content analysis were followed while analysing the data. The results were reported in four categories based on the social marketing constructs. Provision of sickle cell services and preconception care counselling were suggested. The participants preferred to be interviewed in comprehensive healthcare centres in their neighbourhood. The high cost of the lab and medical services was raised as an issue. Face-to-face communication together with other care services was suggested. Providing consultation services in nearby places as in the neighbourhood, including local comprehensive care centres, face-to-face interventions, and mass media, can effectively promote preconception care counselling participation.IMPACT STATEMENTWhat is already known on this subject? The high rate of maternal mortality in women afflicted with sickle cell disease in the south of Iran has attracted growing attention to preconception care counselling in these women. It seems that the social marketing model, due to its audience-based nature, is effective in the acceptance of participatory behaviour in preconception care counselling. To the best of the present researchers' knowledge, there is no similar research in this respect in Iran.What do the results of this study add? Participants' discourse analysis has led to the recognition of the social marketing constituent elements in participation in Preconception care counselling. In their accounts, the participants drew attention to 'Provision of sickle cell services' and 'Provision of Preconception care counseling for sickle cell disease' in their accounts. The participants also mentioned personal, organisational, and sociocultural barriers to the rate of participation. The optimal place was determined for the consultation, and the means of communication were also decided on for implementing the program.What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? Policy-makers and programmers can use the present findings to guide the design and implementation of interventional programs to promote participation in Preconception care counselling for women who have sickle cell disease.
35157404	Multiple Blood Transfusion may contribute to Abnormal Liver and Endocrine Functions in Adults with Sickle Cell Anaemia.	BACKGROUND: The study evaluated the effect of multiple blood transfusions on the prevalence of iron load and its effects on organ functions in patients with sickle cell anaemia (SCA). METHODOLOGY: Sixty-seven multiply transfused SCA subjects and 58 non-multiply transfused SCA controls were investigated. Serum ferritin, insulin, growth hormone (GH), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) were measured by the ELISA method while plasma alanine transaminase (ALT) was measured spectrophotometrically. RESULTS: The median serum ferritin level was 364.97 (142.5-579.3) ng/ml and that of ALT was 12.20 (7.4-16.7) IU/l in the subjects and were significantly higher compared with 115.31 (81.3-285.6) ng/ml and 7.74(5.9-9.9) IU/l obtained in the controls (p <0.001 in each case). TSH was significantly lower 1.45 (0.4-2.9) microIU/ml in subjects compared with 2.12 (0.7-3.6) microIU/ml obtained in the controls (p = 0.034). The mean values for T4 in the subjects was 10.19 +- 1.5 microg/dl and was significantly higher compared with that of the controls of 9.57 +- 1.5 microg/dl (p = 0.026). However, there were no significant differences in the mean values of T3, GH and Insulin between the cases and the controls. There was a strong correlation between serum ferritin level and the number of units of blood transfused in the subjects (r = 0.575, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The study found high serum ferritin level in multiply transfused SCA patients and which also correlated with the number of blood units transfused.
35773052	Gene Therapy for Hemoglobinopathies: Beta-Thalassemia, Sickle Cell Disease.	beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease (SCD) are the most common monogenic diseases in the world and are potentially curable after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or autologous HSCT after genetic modification. Autologous gene therapy has the potential to offer a universal cure that overcomes many limitations of allogeneic HSCT including the lack of available donors, graft-vs-host disease, and graft rejection. Significant progress in gene therapy for the hemoglobinopathies has been made over the last several decades, now with multiple ongoing clinical trials investigating both gene addition and gene-editing strategies. Available results from a small number of patients, some with relatively short follow-up, are promising, with current efforts focused on continuing to improve the efficacy, durability, and safety of gene therapies for the cure of hemoglobin disorders.
32169623	The association between vitamin D deficiency and hospitalization outcomes in pediatric patients with sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: While there is a known association between low vitamin D levels and increased chronic pain in patients with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD), there are no reported studies evaluating the relationship of vitamin D levels and hospitalization outcomes in this population. The aim of this study was to assess this relationship with hospitalization outcomes defined as the number of emergency room (ER) visits, hospital admissions for pain crisis, and length of hospital stay. DESIGN: A retrospective chart review of all pediatric patients with SCD (1-21 years old) was performed from January 2015 to January 2016 in an urban-based hospital setting (n = 134). Those with at least one reported Vitamin D level who maintained follow up during the time studied were enrolled (n = 90). Patient hospitalizations rates were compared between vitamin D deficiency (<20 ng/ml) and sufficiency (>20 ng/ml). RESULTS: Patients with both SCD and vitamin D deficiency were more likely to have at least one Emergency Room visit (p < 0.01), at least one admission for pain crisis (p < 0.01), and a longer length of admission (p < 0.0001) when compared to patients with SCD and sufficient vitamin D levels. CONCLUSION: There is a significant association between vitamin D levels of <20 ng/ml and the number of ER visits, hospital admissions for pain crisis, and length of stay in patients with SCD. Further research is required to assess if correcting vitamin D levels may improve hospitalization outcomes in this population.
37309787	[Management of acute complications of sickle cell disease].	MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE COMPLICATIONS OF SICKLE CELL DISEASE. Acute complications are the most frequent causes of hospitalization and morbidity in patients with sickle cell disease. Vaso-occlusive crisis are responsible of more than 90% of hospitalization, but numerous acute complications can affect multiples organ or function, that may be life-threatening. Thus, a single reason for hospitalization may include many complications such as worsening of an anemia, vascular disease (stroke, thrombosis, priapism), acute chest syndrome, liver or spleen sequestration. Evaluation of acute complications includes the understanding of chronic complications, particularities related to patient's age, the search for a triggering factor and a differential diagnosis. Analgesia and venous access difficulties, post transfusion immunization, medical history of the patient can make the management of acute complication particularly complex.

38488686	Favorable outcome of non-myeloablative allogeneic transplantation in adult patients with severe sickle cell disease: A single center experience of 200 patients.	Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) for adults with severe sickle cell disease (SCD) is potentially curative but not commonly utilized therapy due to complications such as graft failure (GF) and organ toxicity. Herein, we are reporting our long-term outcome data of non-myeloablative (NMA) HSCT in adults with severe SCD with emphasis on factors predicting event free survival (EFS). Adults with severe SCD undergoing NMA match-related donor allogeneic HSCT from 2015 to 2021 with at least 12 months of follow-up were included. A total of 200 patients were included with a median age of 26 years (14-43) and 56% were male. The median infused CD34 dose was 13.7 (5.07-25.8), respectively. Median absolute neutrophil count engraftment was 19 (13-39) days with 51% of patients receiving GCSF to expedite recovery. A total of 17 patients experienced GF; 3 as primary and 14 as secondary within a median time of 204 days (40-905). A 76% successfully discontinued sirolimus at the last follow-up. Median follow-up for the cohort is 29.2 (2.1-71.4) months. Estimated 3-year EFS and OS were 88.2% (81.9-92.5) and 94.6% (89.2-97.3). At multivariable analysis, minor ABC incompatibility hazard ratio (HR) 4 (1.3-12.1; 0.014) and allo-antibody against non-ABO donor antigens HR 4.3 (1.3-14.1; 0.016) were significant for EFS. No clonal evolution or myeloid malignancies were seen. This largest single-center report of NMA HSCT in adults with severe SCD further delineated its feasibility, potential toxicities, and fertility outcomes. GF remains a major impediment and appears dependent on ABO matching and non-ABO antibodies.

33515514	Lentiviral vector ALS20 yields high hemoglobin levels with low genomic integrations for treatment of beta-globinopathies.	Ongoing clinical trials for treatment of beta-globinopathies by gene therapy involve the transfer of the beta-globin gene, which requires integration of three to four copies per genome in most target cells. This high proviral load may increase genome toxicity, potentially limiting the safety of this therapy and relegating its use to total body myeloablation. We hypothesized that introducing an additional hypersensitive site from the locus control region, the complete sequence of the second intron of the beta-globin gene, and the ankyrin insulator may enhance beta-globin expression. We identified a construct, ALS20, that synthesized significantly higher adult hemoglobin levels than those of other constructs currently used in clinical trials. These findings were confirmed in erythroblastic cell lines and in primary cells isolated from sickle cell disease patients. Bone marrow transplantation studies in beta-thalassemia mice revealed that ALS20 was curative at less than one copy per genome. Injection of human CD34+ cells transduced with ALS20 led to safe, long-term, and high polyclonal engraftment in xenograft experiments. Successful treatment of beta-globinopathies with ALS20 could potentially be achieved at less than two copies per genome, minimizing the risk of cytotoxic events and lowering the intensity of myeloablation.
33309081	Meningococcal vaccination in patients with newly diagnosed asplenia in the United States.	BACKGROUND: Patients with asplenia are recommended to receive meningococcal ACWY (MenACWY) and B (MenB) vaccines in the United States (US). OBJECTIVES: To examine uptake and time to receipt of meningococcal vaccines in newly diagnosed asplenia patients, and identify factors associated with vaccination. METHODS: For this retrospective database analysis, patients were identified from 1/1/2010 (MenACWY) or 1/1/2015 (MenB) through 3/31/2018 from an administrative claims database including commercially insured US patients with >=1 inpatient or >=2 outpatient claims with evidence of a new asplenia diagnosis (sickle cell disease was excluded); continuous enrollment for >=12 months before and >=6 months after the index date; and age >=2 (MenACWY) or >=10 (MenB) years. Co-primary outcomes were uptake and time to receipt of >=1 dose, separately for MenACWY and MenB, by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to identify characteristics associated with vaccination. RESULTS: Among 2,273 and 741 patients eligible for the MenACWY and MenB analyses, respectively, 28.1% and 9.7% received MenACWY and MenB in the first 3 years after a new asplenia diagnosis. Patients were more likely to receive meningococcal vaccines if they had received pneumococcal vaccines (MenACWY: hazard ratio [HR] 26.02; 95% confidence interval [CI] 21.01-32.22; MenB: HR 3.89; 95% CI 2.07-7.29) or attended >=1 well-care visit (MenACWY: HR 6.63; 95% CI 4.84-9.09; MenB: HR 11.17; 95% CI 3.02-41.26). CONCLUSIONS: Meningococcal vaccination rates among newly diagnosed asplenia patients were low, highlighting the need to educate providers about the recommendations for high-risk conditions and ensure healthcare access for vulnerable patients.

34553390	Initial experimental experience of triple-knockout pig red blood cells as potential sources for transfusion in alloimmunized patients with sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Blood transfusion remains important in the treatment of patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). However, alloimmunization after blood transfusion is associated with patient morbidity and mortality. Triple-knockout (TKO) pigs (i.e., pigs in which the three known xenoantigens to which humans have anti-pig antibodies have been deleted) may be an alternative source of RBCs for these patients because many humans have no preformed antibodies to TKO pig RBCs (pRBCs). METHODS AND MATERIALS: In an in vitro study, plasma from alloimmunized (n = 12) or non-alloimmunized (n = 12) SCD patients was used to determine IgM/IgG binding to, and CDC of, TKO pRBCs. In an in vivo study, after an estimated 25% of blood volume was withdrawn from two capuchin monkeys, CFSE-labeled TKO pRBCs were transfused. Loss of TKO pRBCs was monitored by flow cytometry, and 7 weeks later, 25% of blood was withdrawn, and CFSE-labeled monkey RBCs were transfused. RESULTS: The in vitro study demonstrated that plasma from neither alloimmunized nor non-alloimmunized SCD patients bound IgM/IgG to, or induced CDC of, TKO pRBCs. In the in vivo study, survival of TKO pRBCs in the two capuchin monkeys was of 5 and 7 days, respectively, whereas after allotransfusion, survival was >28 days. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, (1) in the present limited study, no antibodies were detected that cross-reacted with TKO pRBCs, and (2) TKO pigs may possibly be an alternate source of RBCs in an emergency if no human RBCs are available.
36708354	Iron chelation therapy.	Iron overload is a pathological condition resulting from a congenital impairment of its regulation, increased intestinal iron absorption secondary to bone marrow erythroid hyperplasia, or a chronic transfusional regimen. In normal conditions, intracellular and systemic mechanisms contribute to maintaining iron balance. When this complex homeostatic mechanism fails, an iron overload could be present. Detecting an iron overload is not easy. The gold standard remains the liver biopsy, even if it is invasive and dangerous. Identifying iron using noninvasive techniques allowed a better understanding of the rate of iron overload in different organs, with a low risk for the patient. Estimating serum ferritin (mg/L) is the easiest and, consequently, the most employed diagnostic tool for assessing body iron stores, even if it could be a not specific method. The most common hematological causes of iron overload are myelodysplastic syndromes, sickle cell disease, and thalassemia. In all of these conditions, three drugs have been approved for the treatment of iron overload: deferiprone, deferoxamine, and deferasirox. These chelators have been demonstrated to help lower tissue iron levels and prevent iron overload complications, improving event-free survival (EFS). Nowadays, the decision to start chelation and which chelator to choose remains the joint decision of the clinician and patient.
36934777	Reticulocyte mitochondrial retention increases reactive oxygen species and oxygen consumption in mouse models of sickle cell disease and phlebotomy-induced anemia.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is caused by a mutation of the beta-globin gene that results in the production of hemoglobin S (HbS). People with SCD experience anemia, severe acute pain episodes, persistent chronic pain, multiorgan damage, and a reduced life span. The pathophysiology of SCD caused by the polymerization of HbS on deoxygenation results in red cell deformability and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). These 2 factors lead to red cell fragility and hemolysis. Reticulocytosis is an independent predictor of disease morbidity and mortality in SCD. We previously established that humans and mice with SCD exhibit abnormal mitochondrial retention in erythrocytes increasing ROS-associated hemolysis. Here, we investigated the hypothesis that mitochondrial retention and increased ROS are a consequence of stress erythropoiesis. Our results show clearly that stress erythropoiesis in phlebotomized, anemic AA mice results in mitochondrial retention and increased ROS in reticulocytes. We observed that elevated mitochondrial retention in reticulocytes also alters oxygen consumption and potentially contributes to increased HbS polymerization and red blood cell hemolysis. Therefore, these events occurring due to stress erythropoiesis contribute significantly to the pathology of SCD and suggest new therapeutic targets.

32040047	Clinical Impact of Warmed Intravenous Saline in Sickle Cell Patients With Vasoocclusive Episodes.	OBJECTIVES: In children with sickle cell disease treated for vasoocclusive episodes (VOEs), it is unknown if the temperature of infused fluids impacts clinical outcomes. We compared infusions of warmed and nonwarmed saline for treatment of VOE. We also assessed the tolerability and feasibility of infusing warmed saline in patients with VOEs. METHODS: Patients aged 4 to 21 years with sickle cell disease presenting to the emergency department with VOE were randomized to infusions of warmed (37.5 C, experimental arm) versus nonwarmed (22 C-24 C, controls) saline. Intravenous opioids were administered according to previously established guidelines. We compared hospital admission rates, pain scores, disposition times, dosages of opioid, and comfort. RESULTS: Eighty of 92 visits were eligible (40 per arm). The mean age of enrollees was 14 years, and 53% were female. Hospital admission rates were comparable (63% experimental arm and 55% control arm, P = 0.5). Pain score reduction (-2.9 and -2.6, P = 0.52), median morphine equivalents (0.23 mg/kg and 0.25 mg/kg, P = 0.58), and mean treatment-to-disposition times (158 minutes and 155 minutes, P = 0.85) were also similar. Global comfort was higher in children who received warmed saline (4 vs 3, P = 0.01). There were no adverse events reported in patients who received warmed saline. CONCLUSIONS: It is feasible and tolerable to infuse warmed saline for the treatment of VOE, and it is well tolerated. Patient comfort was higher in those patients who received warmed saline, but there was no improvement in admission rates, disposition times, pain scores, and opioid dosages.
33485798	Allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in sickle cell disease.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the most common monogenic disorders worldwide and affects approximately 100,000 people in the United States alone. SCD can cause numerous complications, including anemia, pain, stroke, and organ failure, which can lead to death. Although there are a few disease-modifying treatments available to patients with SCD, the only current curative option is a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). In this review, we will discuss the different approaches to allogeneic HSCT in the treatment of SCD and the outcomes of these approaches.
32672896	Stable renal function in children and adolescents with sickle cell disease after nonmyeloablative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is associated with renal complications starting as early as infancy. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) treatments using newer nonmyeloablative (NMA) conditioning regimens show promising results in treating SCD in the pediatric population, but renal outcome parameters after transplantation have not been described. AIM: To describe baseline renal parameters as well as short- and long-term renal outcomes in pediatric patients with SCD who underwent NMA-HSCT. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of pediatric patients who received NMA-HSCT in Alberta, Canada. Short-term renal outcomes evaluated were: (1) acute kidney injury (AKI), (2) fluid overload (FO), and (3) hypertension. Long-term outcomes evaluated were: (1) estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) development and at last follow-up with hyperfiltration defined as eGFR >= 150 mL/min/1.73 m2 , (2) proteinuria, and (3) hypertension. RESULTS: The mean follow-up time was 128.6 weeks (standard deviations, 69.3). No posttransplant AKI events or FO were observed. eGFR remained > 90 mL/min/1.73 m2 at last follow-up in all patients, whereas hyperfiltration was present in eight (44.4%) and four (22.2%) patients pre- and post-HSCT, respectively, which are significantly different (P < 0.0001). Consequently, median GFR was significantly higher pre-HSCT compared with 24 months HSCT (P < 0.009). Long-term hypertension post-HSCT was present in six patients (33.3%). CONCLUSION: This study describes stable kidney function in children with SCD after NMA-HSCT without evidence of AKI or FO episodes. Rates of hyperfiltration decreased post-HSCT, which signifies that NMA-HSCT could potentially preserve long-term renal function in this population at risk of progressive chronic kidney disease. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm these novel findings.

34610933	Time trends, sociodemographic and health factors associated with discharge and length of stay of hospitalised patients with sickle cell disease in Ghana: a retrospective analysis of national routine health database.	OBJECTIVE: Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) are prone to multiple episodes resulting in frequent hospital visits. We determined the time trends, sociodemographic and health factors associated with length of stay (LoS) for patients with SCD in Ghana. DESIGN, PARTICIPANTS, SETTING: We retrospectively analysed SCD hospitalisation records of 22 680 patients from a nationwide database of the Ghana Health Service from 2012 to 2017. OUTCOME MEASURES: Factors associated with LoS were estimated using Cox regression, while the cumulative incidence of being discharged alive was estimated with in-hospital death as a competing risk. RESULTS: Patients admitted for SCD over 6 years constituted 22 680 (0.8%) of nearly 3 million admissions. The median age and LoS for the patients were 16 years (IQR=8-24) and 3 days (IQR=2-4), representing 14 202 (62.6%) of the patients discharged alive by the third day. Patients with sickle cell anaemia (6139, 52.6%) with a crisis were more frequent than those without a crisis. Increasing age was associated with shorter LoS when comparing age groups 10-14 years (HR=1.08, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.14) and 25-29 years (HR=1.27, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.37) to patients aged 0-4 years. Patients with comorbidities had a longer LoS compared with those without (HR=0.88, 95% CI 0.86 to 0.90). CONCLUSION: This is the largest study to date documenting factors associated with LoS for patients admitted for SCD. The association of younger age with increased LoS supports recent calls for early SCD screening, especially newborns. The emerging trends and factors accounting for SCD admission require a multisector approach as these patients already experience frequent episodes of pain and hospital visits.
37350478	Pediatric hematology and oncology physician and nurse practitioner views of the HPV vaccine and barriers to administration.	Rates of Human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination among pediatric survivors of cancer and patients with sickle cell disease are lower than the national average. While recent attention has focused on patient HPV vaccine hesitancy and refusal, less is known about provider-level and system-level barriers to vaccinations in pediatric hematology/oncology (PHO) populations. Applying thematic analysis to qualitative interviews with 20 pediatric hematology/oncology physicians and nurse practitioners, we examine their views regarding HPV vaccination, with a focus on access and barriers to providing HPV vaccination in PHO practices. Results demonstrated that despite 90% of interviewees supporting HPV vaccination in their population, the number of pediatric hematology/oncology providers who reported that they counsel about HPV or provide HPV vaccination was 45%, even in stem cell and sickle cell clinics, where other childhood vaccines are commonly provided. Clinicians identified provider-level, clinic-level, and system-level barriers to giving the HPV vaccination, including but not limited to time/flow constraints, lack of resources, and continued education regarding the HPV vaccine. These barriers impede the ability for pediatric hematology/oncology providers to counsel and provide HPV vaccination to this specialized population.

33788404	A systematic review of ketamine for the management of vaso-occlusive pain in sickle cell disease.	Vaso-occlusive episodes (VOEs) are a common complication of sickle cell disease (SCD) and a significant cause of morbidity. Managing VOE pain can be difficult and complex. Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, has been used to manage VOE pain. This systematic literature review synthesizes research published from 2010 to 2020 on the use of ketamine infusion to decrease VOE pain. The review demonstrates that ketamine, a safe and effective treatment for VOE pain, could be considered more widely. However, the significant variability among published clinical studies with regard to dosing, timing of initiation, duration of infusion, and timing of discontinuation highlights the need for standardized ketamine infusion protocols for the management of VOE pain. We conclude with a brief discussion of key components of a potential standardized protocol supported by the literature reviewed as well as areas for future investigation.
36367870	What does it mean to be affiliated with care?: Delphi consensus on the definition of "unaffiliation" and "specialist" in sickle cell disease.	Accruing evidence reveals best practices for how to help individuals living with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD); yet, the implementation of these evidence-based practices in healthcare settings is lacking. The Sickle Cell Disease Implementation Consortium (SCDIC) is a national consortium that uses implementation science to identify and address barriers to care in SCD. The SCDIC seeks to understand how and why patients become unaffiliated from care and determine strategies to identify and connect patients to care. A challenge, however, is the lack of agreed-upon definition for what it means to be unaffiliated and what it means to be a "SCD expert provider". In this study, we conducted a Delphi process to obtain expert consensus on what it means to be an "unaffiliated patient" with SCD and to define an "SCD specialist," as no standard definition is available. Twenty-eight SCD experts participated in three rounds of questions. Consensus was defined as 80% or more of respondents agreeing. Experts reached consensus that an individual with SCD who is unaffiliated from care is "someone who has not been seen by a sickle cell specialist in at least a year." A sickle cell specialist was defined as someone with knowledge and experience in SCD. Having "knowledge" means: being knowledgeable of the 2014 NIH Guidelines, "Evidence-Based Management of SCD", trained in hydroxyurea management and transfusions, trained on screening for organ damage in SCD, trained in pain management and on SCD emergencies, and is aware of psychosocial and cognitive issues in SCD. Experiences that are expected of a SCD specialist include experience working with SCD patients, mentored by a SCD specialist, regular attendance at SCD conferences, and obtains continuing medical education on SCD every 2 years." The results have strong implications for future research, practice, and policy related to SCD by helping to lay a foundation for an new area of research (e.g., to identify subpopulations of unaffiliation and targeted interventions) and policies that support reaffiliation and increase accessibility to quality care.
37731093	A Comparison of the effect of patient-specific vs. weight-based protocols to treat vaso-occlusive episodes (VOE) in the emergency department.	BACKGROUND: Vaso-occlusive episodes (VOC) cause debilitating pain and are a common cause of emergency department (ED) visits, for people with sickle cell disease (SCD). Strategies for achieving optimal pain control vary widely despite evidence-based guidelines. We tested existing guidelines and hypothesized a patient-specific protocol (PSP) written by their SCD provider, may be more effective than weight-based (WB) dosing of parenteral opiate medication, in relieving pain. METHODS: Prospective, randomized controlled trial comparing a PSP versus WB protocol for patients presenting with VOC to six EDs. Patients were randomized to a PSP or WB protocol prior to an ED visit. SCD provider wrote their protocol and placed in the electronic health record for future ED visits with a VOC Exclusion criteria included: pre-existing PSP excluding parenteral opioid analgesia or out-patient use of buprenorphine or methadone, or highly suspected for COVID-19. Pain intensity scores, side effects and safety were obtained every 30 minutes for up to 6 hours post-ED bed placement. The primary outcome was change in pain intensity score from placement in an ED space to disposition or six hours. RESULTS: 328 subjects were randomized, 104 participants enrolled (ED visit, target n=230) with complete data for 96 visits. The study was unable to reach the target sample size and stopped early due to the impact of COVID-19. We found no significant differences between groups in the primary outcome; patients randomized to a PSP had a shorter ED length of stay (p=.008); the prevalence of side effects was low in both groups. Subjects in both groups experienced both a clinically meaningful and statistically significant decrease in pain (27 mm on a 0-100 mm scale) CONCLUSIONS: We found a shorter ED length of stay for patients assigned to a PSP. Patients in both groups experienced good pain relief without significant side effects.
33534136	Hydroyxurea improves cerebral oxygen saturation in children with sickle cell anemia.	Neurologic complications are common in patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA), but conventional tools such as MRI and transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) do not fully assess cerebrovascular pathology. Cerebral tissue oximetry measures mixed oxygen saturation in the frontal lobes (SCT O2 ) and provides early prognostic information about tissue at risk of ischemic injury. Untreated patients with SCA have significantly lower SCT O2 than healthy controls that declines with age. Hydroxyurea is effective in preventing many SCA-related complications, but the degree to which it preserves normal neurophysiology is unclear. We analyzed participants enrolled in the Therapeutic Response Evaluation and Adherence Trial (TREAT, NCT02286154), which enrolled participants initiating hydroxyurea using individualized dosing (new cohort) and those previously taking hydroxyurea (old cohort) and was designed to monitor the long-term benefits of hydroxyurea. Cerebral oximetry was performed at baseline and annually. For the new cohort (median starting age = 12 months, n = 55), mean baseline SCT O2 was normal before starting hydroxyurea (mean 65%, 95% CI 58-72%) and significantly increased after 2 years (mean 72%, 95% CI 65-79%, p < .001). The SCT O2 for patients receiving long-term hydroxyurea (median age = 9.6 years) was normal at study entry (mean 66%, 95% CI 58-74%) and remained stable across 2 years. Both cohorts had significantly higher SCT O2 than published data from predominantly untreated SCA patients. Cerebral oximetry is a non-invasive method to assess cerebrovascular pathology that complements conventional imaging. Our results indicate that hydroxyurea suggests protection against neurophysiologic changes seen in untreated SCA.
37522971	Recent national trends in outcomes and economic disparities among adult sickle cell disease-related admissions.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited disorder caused secondary to a mutation in the hemoglobin beta subunit. There is sparse information regarding the trends in outcomes of SCD admissions in the past decade where rapid advances have been made in treatment. In this study, we wanted to analyze the trends and outcomes of SCD admissions in the United States from 2011 to 2019 and the influence of socio-economic status. Data were obtained from the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database using the International Classification of Disease (ICD-9) and ICD-10 codes. Trends for primary in-hospital outcomes including mortality, length of stay (LOS), and total hospitalization charges (THC) were assessed. The impact of economic status on these outcomes was also studied. There was an annual percent change (APC) in the number of admissions for SCD of + 2.5% from 2010 to 2015 (95% CI: 1.3-3.8%, p = 0.003). However, there was no significant change in the number of admissions between 2015 and 2019 (95% CI - 1.8-0.7%, p = 0.323). The overall mortality across the years has decreased by about 4% yearly at the population level (p = 0.008, 95% CI 2-8%). However, the inpatient mortality for the high-income group had decreased significantly from 2010 to 2019, whereas there was no difference in the mortality rate for the low-income group across the decade. Despite the advances in the understanding of SCD and its treatment, its benefits have not reached all the people affected. Meaningful progress in healthcare is not achievable unless these economic disparities are addressed. Economic policies to address these inequities are the need of the hour.
31644744	"Waiting for a miracle": Spirituality/Religiosity in coping with sickle cell disease.	OBJECTIVE: To understand spirituality/religiosity as experienced by people with sickle cell disease, and its influence on coping with the disease. METHOD: A qualitative, descriptive, and exploratory study conducted in the State of Bahia. Twenty-nine respondents participated in semi-structured interviews. Content analysis was used to analyze the empirical material. RESULTS: Individuals with sickle cell disease experience spirituality/religiosity motivated by their hope for a miracle, and fear of death; among their rites are: reading religious materials, individual and group prayer, and attendance at worship services. The effects on their health include: comfort by means of coping by comparing two evils, anxiety relief, social support, and lifestyle changes; however, spirituality/religiosity may be impaired. FINAL CONSIDERATIONS: This study demonstrates the need to qualify health professionals to address spiritual issues of these individuals during illness, with the aims of diagnosing suffering and anguish, and providing care, comfort and strengthening of the spiritual bonds of these individuals.
33294890	The relation between regular outpatient follow-up and frequency of emergency department visits in sickle cell pediatric patients.	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship between the frequency of ED visits and outpatient department (OPD) follow-up in sickle cell disease (SCD) pediatric patients. METHODS:   A retrospective cohort study included 247 SCD pediatric patients between January 2016 and December 2018 at the Maternity and Children Hospital, Department of Pediatrics, Al Medinah Al Munawarah, Saudi Arabia. Data were extracted from electronic medical record system; patient demographics, medications, frequency of emergency department (ED) and OPD visits. Pearson correlation coefficient, linear regression and independent sample t-test were applied. RESULTS: There was no significant correlation (95% CI [-0.013- 0.233]; p=0.07) between the frequency of ED and OPD visits. However, a significant correlation was found between ED visits and missed OPD appointments. Thus, linear regression was applied and indicated that one missed OPD appointment is associated with 1.92 ED visits, (95% CI: 0.19-0.42; p less than 0.001). Also, a higher rate of ED visits was observed when compared with other studies, with a high ED reliance of 43%. CONCLUSION: This study found that regular OPD visits could improve SCD management, as a directly proportional relationship between the frequency of ED visits and missed OPD appointments along with high ED reliance.
36510393	Clinical Delivery and Effectiveness of Music Therapy in Hematology and Oncology: An EMMPIRE Retrospective Study.	BACKGROUND: Music therapy (MT) has been shown to improve outcomes for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and patients with hematologic and/or oncologic conditions excluding SCD (HemOnc) in prior randomized trials. While few studies have described the clinical delivery (ie, volume, clinical settings, patient characteristics, referrals, and session characteristics) of MT and examined its real-world effectiveness, no studies have compared responses between hematology/oncology populations. The purpose of this study was to examine the clinical delivery and effectiveness of MT at a freestanding academic cancer center and compare the effectiveness of MT on pain, anxiety, and fatigue between adult patients in the HemOnc and SCD groups. METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of all MT sessions provided at a freestanding academic cancer center between January 2017 and July 2020. The unadjusted single-session effects of MT on pain, anxiety, and fatigue were assessed among patients reporting symptoms >=1 out of 10 on a 0 to 10 scale. Adjustments were made for multiple sessions on the same patient using a mixed model to compare pre-session and change scores between the HemOnc and SCD groups. Patients' comments were analyzed using conventional qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Music therapists provided 4002 sessions to 1152 patients including 1012 in the HemOnc group and 140 in the SCD group. In the combined sample, statistically significant reductions in pain (1.48 units), anxiety (2.58 units), and fatigue (0.84 units) were observed, with changes in pain and anxiety exceeding clinically significant thresholds. After adjustment, the SCD group reported significantly greater pre-session pain (7.22 vs 5.81) and anxiety (6.11 vs 5.17) as well as greater anxiety reduction (2.89 vs 2.23) than the HemOnc group. Patients' comments contained themes including enjoyment, gratitude, and improvements in mood, pain, and anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the delivery and clinical effectiveness of MT for addressing the needs of patients throughout their course of treatment at an academic cancer center and justifies the inclusion of individuals with SCD within integrative oncology services.
36883373	Emergency red cell exchange for the management of acute complications in sickle cell disease: Automated versus manual.	BACKGROUND: Red blood cell exchange is the cornerstone of the management for acute complications of sickle cell disease. It improves anaemia and improvesperipheral tissue oxygen delivery while at the same time reduces the proportion of circulating sickle erythrocytes. Even though automated red cell exchange is very effective in rapidly lowering the Hb S level, 24-h availability is currently not feasible for most specialist centres including our own. OBJECTIVE: Here, we describe our experience using both automated and manual red cell exchange for the management of acute sickle cell complications. METHODS: Eighty-six such episodes have been recorded between June 2011 and June 2022 comprising of 68 episodes of automated and 18 episodes of manual red cell exchange. RESULTS: The post procedure Hb S/S + C level was 18% after automated and 36% after manual red cell exchange. The platelet count dropped by 41% and 21% after automated and manual red cell exchange respectively. The clinical outcomes including need for organ support, duration of stay in the intensive care unit and overall length of hospitalisation was comparable between the two groups. CONCLUSION: In our experience, manual red cell exchange is a safe and effective alternative to an automated procedure that can be used while specialist centres are building up their capacity to offer automated red cell exchange for all patients requiring the intervention.

33745883	Cardiac Arrhythmias During Sickle Cell Disease Crisis in the United States.	
36064527	Adverse events of red blood cell transfusions in patients with sickle cell disease.	Blood transfusion is a common medical intervention for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and disease related complications. While patients with SCD are at risk for all transfusion related adverse events defined by the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) Biovigilance Component Hemovigilance Module Surveillance Protocol, they are uniquely susceptible to certain adverse events. This review discusses risk factors, mitigation strategies, and management recommendations for alloimmunization, hemolytic transfusion reactions, hyperviscosity and transfusion-associated iron overload in the context of SCD.
33177052	Clinical management of sickle cell liver disease in children and young adults.	Liver involvement in sickle cell disease (SCD) is often referred to as sickle cell hepatopathy (SCH) and is a complication of SCD which may be associated with significant mortality. This review is based on a round-table workshop between paediatric and adult hepatologists and haematologists and review of the literature. The discussion was prompted by the lack of substantial data and guidance in managing these sometimes very challenging cases. This review provides a structured approach for the diagnosis and management of SCH in children and young adults. The term SCH describes any hepatobiliary dysfunction in the context of SCD. Diagnosis and management of biliary complications, acute hepatic crisis, acute hepatic sequestration and other manifestations of SCH are discussed, as well as the role of liver transplantation and haemopoietic stem cell transplantation in the management of SCH.
31713857	Paediatric haematologists' attitudes regarding haematopoietic cell transplantation as treatment for sickle cell disease.	Beginning early in childhood, patients with sickle cell disease [SCD; a group of genetic haemoglobin disorders characterized by the sickle or HbS mutation (HBB E7V)] are at risk of life-threatening and debilitating health events. Despite the high morbidity and mortality of this disease, haematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), a curative therapy for SCD, remains underutilized. A variety of factors, including the limited availability of suitable donors, play a role in this trend, but do not fully explain the low frequency with which this therapy is employed. The objective of this study was to identify paediatric haematologists' attitudes about HCT as a treatment option for SCD, and to describe the impact of these attitudes on their practices of discussing HCT with families of children affected by this disease. A nationwide survey of paediatric haematologists in the United States was conducted between February and May 2016. Two hundred and eighty-seven surveys were included in the final analysis (response rate 20%). On average, respondents reported informing 42% of families about HCT as a treatment option (N = 248, 95% confidence interval: 38-46). Clinician attitudes about the cost and safety of HCT were associated with practices of discussing this therapy with families. These findings suggest that clinician attitudes and referral practices may play a role in the underutilization of this therapy in the SCD population.
36322607	Multimodal phenotyping and correlates of pain following hematopoietic cell transplant in children with sickle cell disease.	INTRODUCTION: There is limited understanding of pain, patient-reported outcomes (PROs) of health-related quality of life (HRQoL), psychological factors, and experimental pain sensitivity before and following hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) in children with sickle cell disease (SCD). METHODS: Individuals aged 8 years and older, English speaking, and scheduled for a HCT were invited to participate in an observational study where they completed assessments of pain, PROs, psychological factors, and qualitative interviews before and around 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years post-HCT. An optional substudy of experimental pain sensitivity before and around 6 month, 1 year, and 2 years post-HCT was also offered. RESULTS: Data from eight participants (median age 13.5 years, 25% female) with sickle cell anemia (SCA) or similarly severe genotype, and successful donor-derived erythropoiesis post-HCT are reported. We found that collection of pain, PROs, psychological factors, and qualitative data were feasible in the context of HCT. We found moderate to large differences in pain and some PROs between baseline to 1 year and baseline to 2 year post-HCT based on effect sizes, but only some differences were statistically significant. We found moderate to large differences in pressure pain threshold and moderate differences in cold pain threshold between baseline to 1 year and baseline to 2 year post-HCT based on effect sizes, but these differences were not statistically significant. Qualitative data indicated an improvement in pain and HRQoL post-HCT. CONCLUSION: This study provides a framework for the conduct of multimodal pain assessments before and after HCT, which is feasible but faced with unique barriers.
31752858	Not being heard: barriers to high quality unplanned hospital care during young people's transition to adult services - evidence from 'this sickle cell life' research.	BACKGROUND: Young people's experiences of healthcare as they move into adult services can have a major impact on their health, and the transition period for young people with sickle cell disease (SCD) needs improvement. In this study, we explore how young people with SCD experience healthcare during this period of transition. METHODS: We conducted a co-produced longitudinal qualitative study, including 80 interviews in 2016-2017 with young people with SCD aged 13-21 (mean age 16.6) across two cities in England. We recruited 48 participants (30 female, 18 male): 27 interviews were one-off, and 53 were repeated 2-3 times over approximately 18 months. We used an inductive analytical approach, combining elements of Grounded Theory and thematic analysis. RESULTS: Participants reported significant problems with the care they received in A&E during painful episodes, and in hospital wards as inpatients during unplanned healthcare. They experienced delays in being given pain relief and their basic care needs were not always met. Participants said that non-specialist healthcare staff did not seem to know enough about SCD and when they tried to work with staff to improve care, staff often seemed not prepared to listen to them or act on what they said. Participants said they felt out of place in adult wards and uncomfortable with the differences in adult compared with paediatric wards. Because of their experiences, they tried to avoid being admitted to hospital, attempting to manage their painful episodes at home and accessing unplanned hospital care only as a last resort. By contrast, they did not report having problems within SCD specialist services during planned, routine care. CONCLUSIONS: Our study underscores the need for improvements to make services youth-friendly and youth-responsive, including training staff in SCD-specific care, compassionate care and communication skills that will help them elicit and act on young people's voices to ensure they are involved in shaping their own healthcare. If young people are prevented from using transition skills (self-management, self-advocacy), or treated by staff who they worry do not have enough medical competency in their condition, they may well lose their trust in services, potentially compromising their own health.
36853587	Management of Older Adults with Sickle Cell Disease: Considerations for Current and Emerging Therapies.	People with sickle cell disease (SCD) are living longer than ever before, with the median survival increasing from age 14 years in 1973, beyond age 40 years in the 1990s, and as high as 61 years in recent cohorts from academic centers. Improvements in survival have been attributed to initiatives, such as newborn screening, penicillin prophylaxis, vaccination against encapsulated organisms, better detection and treatment of splenic sequestration, and improved transfusion support. There are an estimated 100,000 people living with SCD in the United States and millions of people with SCD globally. Given that the number of older adults with SCD will likely continue to increase as survival improves, better evidence on how to manage this population is needed. When managing older adults with SCD (defined herein as age >= 40 years), healthcare providers should consider the potential pitfalls of extrapolating evidence from existing studies on current and emerging therapies that have typically been conducted with participants at mean ages far below 40 years. Older adults with SCD have historically had little to no representation in clinical trials; therefore, more guidance is needed on how to use current and emerging therapies in this population. This article summarizes the available evidence for managing older adults with SCD and discusses potential challenges to using approved and emerging drugs in this population.
33283990	Post-Transcriptional Genetic Silencing of BCL11A to Treat Sickle Cell Disease.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease is characterized by hemolytic anemia, pain, and progressive organ damage. A high level of erythrocyte fetal hemoglobin (HbF) comprising alpha- and gamma-globins may ameliorate these manifestations by mitigating sickle hemoglobin polymerization and erythrocyte sickling. BCL11A is a repressor of gamma-globin expression and HbF production in adult erythrocytes. Its down-regulation is a promising therapeutic strategy for induction of HbF. METHODS: We enrolled patients with sickle cell disease in a single-center, open-label pilot study. The investigational therapy involved infusion of autologous CD34+ cells transduced with the BCH-BB694 lentiviral vector, which encodes a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting BCL11A mRNA embedded in a microRNA (shmiR), allowing erythroid lineage-specific knockdown. Patients were assessed for primary end points of engraftment and safety and for hematologic and clinical responses to treatment. RESULTS: As of October 2020, six patients had been followed for at least 6 months after receiving BCH-BB694 gene therapy; median follow-up was 18 months (range, 7 to 29). All patients had engraftment, and adverse events were consistent with effects of the preparative chemotherapy. All the patients who could be fully evaluated achieved robust and stable HbF induction (percentage HbF/(F+S) at most recent follow-up, 20.4 to 41.3%), with HbF broadly distributed in red cells (F-cells 58.9 to 93.6% of untransfused red cells) and HbF per F-cell of 9.0 to 18.6 pg per cell. Clinical manifestations of sickle cell disease were reduced or absent during the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: This study validates BCL11A inhibition as an effective target for HbF induction and provides preliminary evidence that shmiR-based gene knockdown offers a favorable risk-benefit profile in sickle cell disease.

32201153	Alternative donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for sickle cell disease in Europe.	Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is, to date, the only curative treatment for sickle cell disease (SCD). Because an human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling donor is not always available, alternative stem cell sources such as unrelated or haploidentical related donors have been explored. To date, few series of SCD patients transplanted with an unrelated donor, cord blood, and haploidentical related donor have been reported, but the high rates of rejection and chronic graft versus host disease have limited their widespread application. We describe the outcomes of a retrospective, registry-based, survey on 144 alternative donor HSCT performed for SCD in 30 European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation centers between 1999 and 2017. Data on 70 unrelated adult donors (49%), six cord blood (4%), and 68 haploidentical donors (47%; including post-HSCT Cy, ex vivo T-cell depleted, and other haplo-HSCTs) were reported and missing information was updated by the centers. Overall, 16% patients experienced graft failure, Grade II-IV acute GVHD at 100 days was 24%, whereas Grade III-IV was 10%. Chronic GVHD was observed in 24% (limited for 13 patients and extensive for 18 patients). Overall, the 3-year overall survival (OS) was 86% +- 3% and 3-year event-free survival (EFS; considering death and graft failure as events) was 72% +- 4%. We therefore conclude that alternative donor HSCT for SCD can be feasible but efforts in decreasing relapse and GVHD should be promoted to increase its safe and successful utilization. Moreover, a better knowledge of HLA matching and the tailoring of conditioning could help improve EFS and OS.
32926630	Challenges and Opportunities of Deferoxamine Delivery for Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, and Intracerebral Hemorrhage.	Deferoxamine mesylate (DFO) is an FDA-approved, hexadentate iron chelator routinely used to alleviate systemic iron burden in thalassemia major and sickle cell patients. Iron accumulation in these disease states results from the repeated blood transfusions required to manage these conditions. Iron accumulation has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and secondary injury following intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Chelation of brain iron is thus a promising therapeutic strategy for improving behavioral outcomes and slowing neurodegeneration in the aforementioned disease states, though the effectiveness of DFO treatment is limited on several accounts. Systemically administered DFO results in nonspecific toxicity at high doses, and the drug's short half-life leads to low patient compliance. Mixed reports of DFO's ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) also appear in literature. These limitations necessitate novel DFO formulations prior to the drug's widespread use in managing neurodegeneration. Herein, we discuss the various dosing regimens and formulations employed in intranasal (IN) or systemic DFO treatment, as well as the physiological and behavioral outcomes observed in animal models of AD, PD, and ICH. The clinical progress of chelation therapy with DFO in managing neurodegeneration is also evaluated. Finally, the elimination of intranasally administered particles via the glymphatic system and efflux transporters is discussed. Abundant preclinical evidence suggests that intranasal DFO treatment improves memory retention and behavioral outcome in rodent models of AD, PD, and ICH. Several other biochemical and physiological metrics, such as tau phosphorylation, the survival of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons, and infarct volume, are also positively affected by intranasal DFO treatment. However, dosing regimens are inconsistent across studies, and little is known about brain DFO concentration following treatment. Systemic DFO treatment yields similar results, and some complex formulations have been developed to improve permeability across the BBB. However, despite the success in preclinical models, clinical translation is limited with most clinical evidence investigating DFO treatment in ICH patients, where high-dose treatment has proven dangerous and dosing regimens are not consistent across studies. DFO is a strong drug candidate for managing neurodegeneration in the aging population, but before it can be routinely implemented as a therapeutic agent, dosing regimens must be standardized, and brain DFO content following drug administration must be understood and controlled via novel formulations.
37979134	How We Treat Sickle Cell Disease in Pregnancy.	50 years ago, people with sickle cell disease (SCD) were discouraged from becoming pregnant, but now most should be supported if they choose to pursue a pregnancy. They and their providers, however, should be aware of the physiological changes of pregnancy that aggravate SCD and pregnancy's unique maternal and fetal challenges. Any maternal endothelial damage from a poorly perfused placenta has the potential for being superimposed on the endothelial damage of SCD. The immunological and mechanical changes of pregnancy contribute to an increased susceptibility to certain infections. Activation of the complement system and increased neutrophils may contribute to the increase in vaso-occlusive crises during pregnancy. There is an increased demand for red cell mass that is often not achievable without transfusion. Cardiac output increases by 45%. The anatomic and physiologic changes of pregnancy increase the risk of kidney injury. Pregnancy is a hypercoagulable state which confers an increased risk of thrombosis. Maternal problems can arise from chronic underlying organ dysfunction such as renal disease or pulmonary hypertension, from acute complications of SCD such as acute anemia, vaso-occlusive crises and acute chest syndrome, and/or from pregnancy-related complications such as preeclampsia, sepsis, severe anemia, thromboembolism and need for cesarean delivery. Fetal problems include alloimmunization, opioid exposure, fetal growth restriction, preterm delivery, and stillbirth. Prior to and during pregnancy, in addition to the assessment and care that every pregnant patient should receive, patients with SCD should be evaluated and treated by a multidisciplinary team with respect to their unique maternal and fetal issues.
37043702	Secondary Malignancies After Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation for Sickle Cell Disease Inform Gene Therapy Approaches.	
35907865	ADaPTS "(AD)olescents (P)ath through (T)ransplant (S)ickle cell disease".	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease is an inherited chronic hematological disorder with an average lifespan of fifty years. The human cost of sickle cell disease includes missed school days, occupational opportunities, social isolation, stigmatization, and psychological sequelae. Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is the only curative therapy available but comes with potential morbidity and mortality. Our study explores how quality of life (QoL) is affected from the perspective of an adolescent who has undergone a nonmyeloablative matched sibling donor HCT. METHODS: We employed multiple case study methodology with purposeful sampling by selecting information-rich cases. DATA SOURCES: 1) QoL inventories 2) patient interviews 3) parent interview 4) vital support interview 5) medical record analysis. DATA ANALYSIS: Intra-case analysis by assembling evidence within a single case and then analyzing the differences within cases to create a rich case description. Next, a time series analysis was completed to track changes in patients' QoL. We used multiple sources of data to compose a timeline and changes across time. Then, we employed pattern matching as an analytical technique allowing for examination of patterns across cases. Finally, we used cross case synthesis to review results of each case. RESULTS: Quality of life was reported across the physical, social and psychological domains for 5 participants. All had sickle cell HgSS genotype, 80% were male and 80% were born outside of Canada. Physical domain: pre-transplant, 100% of patients experienced pain, and the majority suffered from fatigue, insomnia, and fevers resulting in hospitalizations. Afterwards, participants reported improved physical wellbeing. Social domain: pre-transplant, QoL was poor characterized by stigma, social isolation, and parental absenteeism. Post-HSCT adolescents gained social acceptance in areas that had stigmatized and excluded them. They were able to participate freely in activities with peers and their social life vastly improved. Psychological pre-transplant life experiences were overshadowed by psychological stress. The majority commented that their future was bleak and may lead to premature death. Afterwards adolescents described a crisis free life with positive psychological outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents with sickle cell disease who undertook HCT demonstrated improved QoL one year post transplant with regard to physical, social and psychological well-being.
31880407	Haploidentical bone marrow transplantation in a patient with sickle cell disease and acute myeloid leukemia.	Myeloid neoplasms in children with sickle cell disease have been rarely reported, and the exact underlying connection between these two conditions is not clearly understood. Whether the acute myeloid leukemia in hydroxyurea-treated sickle cell patients is co-incidental or related to therapy remains an unanswered question. Herein, we report a 14-year-old girl of Haitian descent with sickle beta zero thalassemia on chronic hydroxyurea therapy who developed FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3)-mutated acute myeloid leukemia and underwent a complete disease remission following a combination chemotherapy with sorafenib and was subsequently treated using a T cell replete unmanipulated haploidentical bone marrow transplantation followed by post-transplant cyclophosphamide.
32617981	Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for people with sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease is a genetic disorder involving a defect in the red blood cells due to its sickled hemoglobin. The main therapeutic interventions include preventive and supportive measures. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantations are carried out with the aim of replacing the defective cells and their progenitors (hematopoietic (i.e. blood forming) stem cells) in order to correct the disorder. This is an update of a previously published review. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether stem cell transplantation can improve survival and prevent symptoms and complications associated with sickle cell disease. To examine the risks of stem cell transplantation against the potential long-term gain for people with sickle cell disease. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register complied from electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (updated each new issue of the Cochrane Library) and quarterly searches of MEDLINE. We also searched trial registries for ongoing trials up to April 2020. Date of the most recent search of the Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 09 December 2019. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled and quasi-randomized trials that compared any method of stem cell transplantation with either each other or with any of the preventive or supportive interventions (e.g. periodic blood transfusion, use of hydroxyurea, antibiotics, pain relievers, supplemental oxygen) in people with sickle cell disease irrespective of the type of sickle cell disease, gender and setting. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: No trials were eligible for inclusion in the review. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 12 potentially-eligible trials by the searches; we excluded 11 of these and the remaining trial is an ongoing trial that may be eligible for inclusion in a future version of the review. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Reports on the use of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation improving survival and preventing symptoms and complications associated with sickle cell disease are currently limited to observational and other less robust studies. We did not find any eligible randomized controlled trials assessing the benefit or risk of hematopoietic stem cell transplantations. However, there is an ongoing quasi-randomized trial comparing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with standard care, Thus, this systematic review identifies the need for a multicentre randomized controlled trial assessing the benefits and possible risks of hematopoietic stem cell transplantations comparing sickle status and severity of disease in people with sickle cell disease.

34166998	Evidence for continued dose escalation of plerixafor for hematopoietic progenitor cell collections in sickle cell disease.	We present data from our study of plerixafor mobilization (NCT02193191) relevant to the question of whether further dose escalation of plerixafor can address inconsistent adequacy of CD34+ mobilization for gene therapy of sickle cell disease (SCD). We found that, in the same patient, higher plerixafor dosing was associated with higher fold increases in PB CD34+ count, but not necessarily higher absolute CD34+ counts. Variation in pre-apheresis absolute CD34+ counts was related to intra-individual variation in baseline PB CD34+ counts and inter-individual variation in responsiveness to plerixafor. Overall, our results support further studies of continued dose escalation of plerixafor for autologous HPC collection in SCD.
37470933	Pediatric Moyamoya Revascularization Perioperative Care: A Modified Delphi Study.	BACKGROUND: Surgical revascularization decreases the long-term risk of stroke in children with moyamoya arteriopathy but can be associated with an increased risk of stroke during the perioperative period. Evidence-based approaches to optimize perioperative management are limited and practice varies widely. Using a modified Delphi process, we sought to establish expert consensus on key components of the perioperative care of children with moyamoya undergoing indirect revascularization surgery and identify areas of equipoise to define future research priorities. METHODS: Thirty neurologists, neurosurgeons, and intensivists practicing in North America with expertise in the management of pediatric moyamoya were invited to participate in a three-round, modified Delphi process consisting of a 138-item practice patterns survey, anonymous electronic evaluation of 88 consensus statements on a 5-point Likert scale, and a virtual group meeting during which statements were discussed, revised, and reassessed. Consensus was defined as >= 80% agreement or disagreement. RESULTS: Thirty-nine statements regarding perioperative pediatric moyamoya care for indirect revascularization surgery reached consensus. Salient areas of consensus included the following: (1) children at a high risk for stroke and those with sickle cell disease should be preadmitted prior to indirect revascularization; (2) intravenous isotonic fluids should be administered in all patients for at least 4 h before and 24 h after surgery; (3) aspirin should not be discontinued in the immediate preoperative and postoperative periods; (4) arterial lines for blood pressure monitoring should be continued for at least 24 h after surgery and until active interventions to achieve blood pressure goals are not needed; (5) postoperative care should include hourly vital signs for at least 24 h, hourly neurologic assessments for at least 12 h, adequate pain control, maintaining normoxia and normothermia, and avoiding hypotension; and (6) intravenous fluid bolus administration should be considered the first-line intervention for new focal neurologic deficits following indirect revascularization surgery. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of data supporting specific care practices before and after indirect revascularization surgery in children with moyamoya, this Delphi process defined areas of consensus among neurosurgeons, neurologists, and intensivists with moyamoya expertise. Research priorities identified include determining the role of continuous electroencephalography in postoperative moyamoya care, optimal perioperative blood pressure and hemoglobin targets, and the role of supplemental oxygen for treatment of suspected postoperative ischemia.
35234095	Higher hydroxyurea adherence among young adults with sickle cell disease compared to children and adolescents.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) results in severe complications, such as anaemia and pain episodes. Hydroxyurea (HU) is efficacious in SCD, yet adherence remains low. OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationship of HU adherence to health care utilization and patients' characteristics. METHODS: This is a 5-year retrospective chart review. Patients' demographics and medical history were collected from the electronic medical record (EMR). HU adherence was evaluated using foetal haemoglobin "HbF%", mean corpuscular volume "MCV", and absolute neutrophil count "ANC". Age groups included children (<12 years), adolescents (12-17 years), and young adults (>=18 years). RESULTS: A total of 113 SCD patients on HU were included (median age 14 years, IQR 10-20; 50% female; 88% HbSS). Young adults had significantly higher HU adherence compared to adolescents and children, including higher median HbF% (24.2 vs. 12.4 vs. 8.6, p = .003), MCV (fl) (106.4 vs. 96.2 vs. 95.4, p = .01) and lower ANC (103/ml) (3.25 vs. 4.9 vs. 4.2, p = .01), respectively. Patients with chronic pain had lower HU adherence (HbF% 15.3 vs. 10.7, p = .04; ANC 3.6 vs. 6.3, p = .002; MCV 102.3 vs. 93.1, p = .1). Patients with higher HbF or MCV and lower ANC had significantly less frequent emergency room visits (rs=-0.26, p = .01; rs=-0.23, p = .01; rs=0.24, p = .01) and hospitalizations (rs=-0.27, p = .01; rs=-0.31, p = .01; rs=0.21, p = .02) as well as shorter length of stays (rs=-0.27, p = .0045; rs=-.34, p = 0.004; rs=0.23, p = .02), respectively. Similar trends in HU adherence and health care utilization were seen in subgroup analysis of only HbSS patients. There was no significant association of HU adherence to patients' sex, socio-economic status, distance from hospital, and HU duration. CONCLUSIONS: Young adults with SCD had significantly higher HU adherence compared to children and adolescents. Patients with lower HU adherence and/or chronic pain had increased health care utilization. Future studies examining barriers to adherence and evaluating interventions to optimize HU adherence in SCD are warranted.KEY MESSAGESYoung adults with SCD had significantly higher HU adherence, as reflected in their laboratory markers, compared to children and adolescents.Patients with higher HU adherence and/or those without chronic pain had lower or less frequent health care utilization.No significant association of HU adherence to patients' sex, socio-economic status and distance from hospital.
34270376	Gaps in knowledge about the vaccine coverage of immunocompromised children: a scoping review.	Immunocompromised children are at increased risk of severe illness from vaccine-preventable infections. However, inadequate vaccine coverage remains a concern. This scoping review sought to determine the current state of knowledge regarding vaccine coverage of immunocompromised children. Bibliographic databases were searched for primary research from any year. Data were analyzed quantitatively and narratively. Ninety-seven studies met inclusion criteria. The most commonly studied vaccines were pneumococcal (n = 46), influenza (n = 44), diphtheria/tetanus/pertussis/poliomyelitis/Haemophilus influenzae type B/hepatitis B-containing (n = 36), and measles- and/or mumps- and/or rubella-containing (n = 29). Immunocompromising conditions studied included cancer/stem cell transplants (n = 24), solid organ transplants (n = 23), sickle cell disease (n = 21), immunosuppressive therapy (n = 14), human immunodeficiency virus (n = 12), splenectomy (n = 4), and primary immunodeficiency (n = 2). As more children are treated with immunosuppressive therapies, it is critical to identify whether they are being appropriately vaccinated for age and condition. We identified gaps in the current state of knowledge for specific vaccine types in specific immunocompromised populations.
36147559	Use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist trigger in fertility preservation for patients with inherited genetic disorders.	In patients with varying hematologic disorders (thalassemia, sickle cell anemia, aplastic anemia, etc.), inherited bone marrow failure syndromes, and immune deficiencies due to a single gene disorder, the advent of stem cell transplantation (SCT) as a treatment option has allowed for significant disease improvement, and possibly cure. This specific treatment option often requires exposure to chemotherapeutic agents and sometimes whole body radiation; therefore, primary ovarian insufficiency is often sequelae of the therapy. The optimization of fertility preservation protocols within this patient population is of extreme importance. This review aims to detail the use of GnRH agonist use within this patient population, within the context of fertility preservation cycles.
38707762	Diagnostic Role of Oral Fluorescein Angiography in Pediatric Ambulatory Clinics.	Oral ingestion of fluorescein can be done in ambulatory pediatric clinics. We show that oral ultra-widefield fluorescein angiography is a non-invasive approach to rapidly diagnose and manage a diverse set of pediatric retinal vascular diseases.
35131485	Thrombospondin-1, Platelet Factor 4, and Galectin-1 Are Associated with Engraftment in Patients with Sickle Cell Disease who Underwent Haploidentical Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited red blood cell disorder that leads to significant morbidity and early mortality. The most widely available curative approach remains allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). HLA-haploidentical (haplo) HSCT expands the donor pool considerably and is a practical alternative for these patients, but traditionally with an increased risk of allograft rejection. Biomarkers in patient plasma could potentially help predict HSCT outcome and allow treatment at an early stage to reverse or prevent graft rejection. Reliable, noninvasive methods to predict engraftment or rejection early after HSCT are needed. We sought to detect variations in the plasma proteomes of patients who engrafted compared with those who rejected their grafts. We used a mass spectrometry-based proteomics approach to identify candidate biomarkers associated with engraftment and rejection by comparing plasma samples obtained from 9 engrafted patients and 10 patients who experienced graft rejection. A total of 1378 proteins were identified, 45 of which were differentially expressed in the engrafted group compared with the rejected group. Based on bioinformatics analysis results, information from the literature, and immunoassay availability, 7 proteins-thrombospondin-1 (Tsp-1), platelet factor 4 (Pf-4), talin-1, moesin, cell division control protein 42 homolog (CDC42), galectin-1 (Gal-1), and CD9-were selected for further analysis. We compared these protein concentrations among 35 plasma samples (engrafted, n = 9; rejected, n = 10; healthy volunteers, n = 8; nontransplanted SCD, n = 8). ELISA analysis confirmed the significant up-regulation of Tsp-1, Pf-4, and Gal-1 in plasma samples from engrafted patients compared with rejected patients, healthy African American volunteers, and the nontransplanted SCD group (P < .01). By receiver operating characteristic analysis, these 3 proteins distinguished engrafted patients from the other groups (area under the curve, >0.8; P < .05). We then evaluated the concentration of these 3 proteins in samples collected pre-HSCT and at days +30, +60, +100, and +180 post-HSCT. The results demonstrate that Tsp-1 and Pf-4 stratified engrafted patients as early as day 60 post-HSCT (P < .01), and that Gal-1 was significantly higher in engrafted patients as early as day 30 post-HSCT (P < .01). We also divided the rejected group into those who experienced primary (n = 5) and secondary graft rejection (n = 5) and found that engrafted patients had significantly higher Tsp-1 levels compared with patients who developed primary graft rejection at days +60 and +100 (P < .05), as well as higher Pf-4 levels compared with patients who developed primary graft rejection at post-transplantation (PT) day 100. Furthermore, Tsp-1 levels were significantly higher at PT days 60 and 100 and Pf-4 levels were higher at PT day 100 in engrafted patients compared with those who experienced secondary graft rejection. Increased concentrations of plasma Gal-1, Tsp-1, and Pf-4 could reflect increased T regulatory cells, IL-10, and TGF-beta, which are essential players in the initiation of immunologic tolerance. These biomarkers may provide opportunities for preemptive intervention to minimize the incidence of graft rejection.
34889373	How to avoid the problem of erythrocyte alloimmunization in sickle cell disease.	Erythrocyte alloimmunization is a major barrier to transfusion in sickle cell disease (SCD) because it can lead to transfusion deadlock and the development of life-threatening hemolytic transfusion reactions (HTRs). Several risk factors have been identified, such as blood group polymorphism in these patients of African ancestry frequently exposed to antigens they do not carry and an inflammatory clinical state of the disease. The most important preventive measure is prophylactic red blood cell antigen matching, and there is a consensus that matching for Rh (D, C, E, c, e) and K antigens should be performed for all SCD patients. However, some patients are high responders and more at risk of developing antibodies and HTRs. For these patients, the extension of matching to other blood groups, including variant antigens of the RH blood group, the use of genotyping rather than serology to characterize significant blood groups, and the prophylactic administration of immunosuppressive treatments remain a matter of debate due to low levels of certainty concerning their effects and the difficulty of determining which patients, other than those already immunized, are at high risk. These issues were recently addressed by a panel of experts established by the American Society of Hematology. Here, we review and stratify the various interventions for preventing alloimmunization, based on the literature and our experience and taking into account the obstacles to their implementation and any future developments required.
34077086	Live birth following preimplantation genetic testing to prevent sickle cell disease in a low resource setting: A case report.	Preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic disorders (PGT-M) can detect sickle cell disease (HbSS) in embryos during In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF), to ensure the birth of unaffected children. The prevalence of haemoglobin S gene (HbS) is high in Nigeria and Sub-Saharan Africa, but access to PGT-M services in the setting is limited. A couple with the sickle cell trait (HbAS) had IVF, following which 12 embryos were biopsied and the corresponding cells analyzed using minisequencing for whole genome amplification and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to determine each embryo's haemoglobin (Hb) genotype. Two HbAA (normal) embryos were transferred to the mother resulting in the birth of a live HbAA male infant at 38 weeks gestation. The child has remained well after nine months of follow up with HbAA at repeat genotype evaluation.

32255722	Bridging the Gap Among Clinical Practice Guidelines for Pain Management in Cancer and Sickle Cell Disease.	Opioids are a critical component of pain relief strategies for the management of patients with cancer and sickle cell disease. The escalation of opioid addiction and overdose in the United States has led to increased scrutiny of opioid prescribing practices. Multiple reports have revealed that regulatory and coverage policies, intended to curb inappropriate opioid use, have created significant barriers for many patients. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Comprehensive Cancer Network, and ASCO each publish clinical practice guidelines for the management of chronic pain. A recent JAMA Oncology article highlighted perceived variability in recommendations among these guidelines. In response, leadership from guideline organizations, government representatives, and authors of the original article met to discuss challenges and solutions. The meeting featured remarks by the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, presentations on each clinical practice guideline, an overview of the pain management needs of patients with sickle cell disease, an overview of perceived differences among guidelines, and a discussion of differences and commonalities among the guidelines. The meeting revealed that although each guideline varies in the intended patient population, target audience, and methodology, there is no disagreement among recommendations when applied to the appropriate patient and clinical situation. It was determined that clarification and education are needed regarding the intent, patient population, and scope of each clinical practice guideline, rather than harmonization of guideline recommendations. Clinical practice guidelines can serve as a resource for policymakers and payers to inform policy and coverage determinations.
35891584	Neuropsychological, behavioral, and quality-of-life outcomes in children and adolescents with sickle cell disease treated with nonmyeloablative matched sibling donor hematopoietic cell transplantation: A case series.	BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Despite advances in the treatment of sickle cell disease (SCD), cerebrovascular and cognitive insults can have lifelong consequences. Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is an established curative therapy, and recent studies have demonstrated efficacy with reduced toxicity nonmyeloablative (NMA) regimens, but little is known about neuropsychological outcomes. The objective of this study was to describe neuropsychological, behavioral, and quality-of-life outcomes with medical correlates in children with SCD who received an NMA matched sibling donor (MSD) HCT. DESIGN/METHODS: Retrospective cohort analysis of nine recipients with hemoglobin SS SCD who underwent MSD HCT using the National Institutes of Health (NIH) NMA protocol. RESULTS: Mean full-scale intellectual functioning (FSIQ) was average pre-HCT (FSIQ = 92.1, SD 9.0; n = 8) and 2 years post-HCT (mean FSIQ = 96.6; SD 11.1; N = 9). Neuropsychological functioning was largely average across all cognitive domains, and no pre/post-HCT differences were found to be statistically significant given the small sample size. However, effect sizes revealed moderate improvements in processing speed (Cohen's d = .72) and verbal memory (Cohen's d = .60) post-HCT, and declines in measures of attention (Cohen's d = -.54) and fine motor speed and dexterity (Cohen's d = -.94). Parents endorsed better quality of life (Cohen's d = .91), less impact of SCD on their family, and less worry about their child's future (Cohen's d = 1.44). CONCLUSION: Neuropsychological functioning in a sample of children and adolescents treated uniformly with NMA MSD HCT remained stable or improved in most cognitive domains, and improvements in quality of life and family functioning were observed.
36975201	Gene therapy in sickle cell disease: Attitudes and informational needs of patients and caregivers.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited blood disorder that results in serious morbidity and early mortality. Novel therapies for SCD, most notably genetic therapies (GTs) and HLA-mismatched donor hematopoietic cell transplantation, are in clinical trials. While potentially curative, these interventions are some of the most intensive treatments for SCD and are associated with serious and life-altering side effects, which may manifest several years after treatment. Little is known about knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes of individuals with SCD, or their caregivers, toward existing and these emerging therapies. METHODS: Patients with SCD at least 13 years of age (n = 66) and caregivers (n = 38) were surveyed about knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs surrounding treatments for SCD. RESULTS: Only 4.8% felt "extremely knowledgeable" about GT for SCD while the majority (63.4%) reported little knowledge. Overall, health literacy was low among respondents. Most respondents had a neutral attitude regarding the safety of GT for SCD, and whether it was a good treatment for the disorder (56.7% and 58.6%, respectively). Only a few respondents endorsed the idea that GT was "unsafe" or "not a good treatment" (5.8% and 4.8%, respectively). There was an association between increasing knowledge about GT and agreement that it is safe (p = .012) and a good treatment for SCD (p = .031). CONCLUSIONS: Given that very few patients with SCD feel knowledgeable about GT and a majority have neutral feelings about the safety and utility of this new approach, culturally appropriate patient-centered education is urgently needed as these treatments get regulatory approval and proceed to the clinic.
32203007	Effects of repleting organic phosphates in banked erythrocytes on plasma metabolites and vasoactive mediators after red cell exchange transfusion in sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Red blood cell (RBC) exchange (RCE) transfusion therapy is indicated for certain patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Although beneficial, this therapy is costly and inconvenient to patients, who may require it monthly or more often. Identification of blood and plasma biomarkers that could improve or help individualise RCE therapy is of interest. Here we examined relevant blood and plasma metabolites and biomarkers of vasoactivity and RBC fragility in a pilot study of SCD patients undergoing RCE using either standard RBC units or RBC units treated with a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved additive solution containing phosphate, inosine, pyruvate, and adenine ("PIPA"). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective, single-blind, cross-over pilot clinical trial, patients were randomised to receive either standard RBC exchange or PIPA-treated RBC exchange transfusion with each RCE session over a 6-month treatment period. Pre- and post-transfusion blood samples were obtained and analysed for RBC O2 affinity, ATP, purine metabolites, RBC microparticles, and cell free haemoglobin. RESULTS: Red blood cell O2 affinity was maintained after PIPA-RCE in contrast to standard RCE, after which P50 fell (net O2 affinity rose). Plasma ATP did not change significantly after RCE using either of the RBC unit types. Exchange transfusion with PIPA-treated RBC units led to modest increases in plasma inosine and hypoxanthine. Plasma cell free haemoglobin fell after either standard or PIPA-treated RBC exchange transfusion (novel findings), and to a similar extent. RBC-derived microparticles in the plasma fell significantly and similarly after both standard and PIPA-treated RCE transfusion. DISCUSSION: In summary, treatment of RBCs with PIPA prior to RCE elicited favourable or neutral changes in key metabolic and vascular biomarkers. Further study of its efficacy and safety is recommended and could ultimately serve to improve outcomes in chronically transfused SCD patients.
32202246	Should young children with sickle cell disease and an available human leukocyte antigen identical sibling donor be offered hematopoietic cell transplantation?	Availability of an HLA-identical sibling donor raises the question, "should young children with SCD, and an available HLA identical sibling donor be considered for hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) even before they manifest severe clinical presentations of sickle cell disease (SCD)?" The overall survival (OS) and event free survival (EFS) following HCT from an HLA identical sibling is excellent in young children, and worsen with increasing age at HCT. SCD related complications, organ dysfunction, quality of life, and risk for premature mortality all worsen with age. The ethical principles of non-maleficence, beneficence, autonomy and justice all support the consideration of this life, quality of life, and organ saving therapy at a young age.
33862367	Co-morbidities and mortality in patients with sickle cell disease in England: A 10-year cohort analysis using hospital episodes statistics (HES) data.	Patients with a primary diagnosis of sickle cell disease (SCD) with or without crisis during the 10-year period January 2009 to December 2018 were identified in the HES Admitted Patient Care (APC) dataset and matched with the Office for National Statistics (ONS) mortality dataset. Three sub-cohorts were defined: 'crises', 'transfusions' and 'other SCD'. APC records were examined for co-morbidities commonly associated with SCD and 10-year mortality rates compared with the general population. After data cleaning and exclusions, 9503 patients remained (entire cohort), with 1171, 201, and 8131 in crises, transfusions, and other SCD sub-cohorts, respectively. Median numbers of co-morbidities per patient were 2 (Interquartile range (IQR): 1-4), 2 (IQR: 1-3), and 1 (IQR: 0-2) in the crises, transfusions, and other SCD sub-cohorts, respectively. The majority of patients in the crises (63.2%) and transfusions (56.3%) cohorts had >=2 co-morbidities, compared with 25.3% in the other SCD sub-cohort. Crude 10-year mortality rate was 5.3% (entire cohort), compared with 8.0% (crises) and 11.4% (transfusions) sub-cohorts; all rates were substantially higher than in age-sex matched general population. Our study adds further evidence that morbidity and mortality associated with SCD in England is high.
34208829	Ex Vivo Activation of Red Blood Cell Senescence by Plasma from Sickle-Cell Disease Patients: Correlation between Markers and Adhesion Consequences during Acute Disease Events.	BACKGROUND: Blood transfusion remains a key treatment for managing occlusive episodes and painful crises in sickle-cell disease (SCD). In that clinical context, red blood cells (RBCs) from donors and transfused to patients, may be affected by plasma components in the recipients' blood. Senescence lesion markers appear on the red cells after transfusion, shortening the RBC lifespan in circulation. In the specific context of SCD, senescence signals can also trigger the occlusive painful events, typical of the disease. This work follows through our previous data that described a RBC senescence process, rapidly detected after challenge with SCD pathological plasmas. In this clinical context, we wanted here to further explore the characteristics and physiologic consequences of AA RBC lesions associated with senescence, as lesions caused by RBCs after transfusion may have adverse consequences for SCD patients. METHODS: Plasma samples from SCD patients, with acute symptoms (n = 20) or steady-state disease (n = 34) were co-incubated with donor AA RBCs from blood units for 24 to 48 h. Specific markers signing RBC senescence were quantified after the incubation with SCD plasma samples. The physiologic in-flow adhesion was investigated on senescent RBCs, an in vitro technic into biochips that mimic adherence of RBCs during the occlusive events of SCD. RESULTS: Senescence markers on AA RBCs, together with their in-flow adhesion to the plasma-bridging protein thrombospondin, were associated with the clinical status of the SCD patients from whom plasma was obtained. In these experiments, the highest values were obtained for SCD acute plasma samples. Adhesion of senescent RBCs into biochips, which is not reversed by a pre-treatment with recombinant Annexin V, can be reproduced with the use of chemical agents acting on RBC membrane channels that regulate either Ca2+ entry or modulating RBC hydration. CONCLUSION: We found that markers on red cells are correlated, and that the senescence induced by SCD plasma provokes the adhesion of RBCs to the vessel wall protein thrombospondin. In-flow adhesion of senescent red cells after plasma co-incubations can be reproduced with the use of modulators of RBC membrane channels; activating the Piezo1 Ca2+ mechanosensitive channel provokes RBC adhesion of normal (non-senescent) RBCs, while blocking the Ca2+-dependent K+ Gardos channel, can reverse it. Clinically modulating the RBC adhesion to vascular wall proteins might be a promising avenue for the treatment of painful occlusive events in SCD.

33570182	Cognitive performance as a predictor of healthcare transition in sickle cell disease.	Neurocognitive deficits in sickle cell disease (SCD) may impair adult care engagement. We investigated the relationship between neurocognitive functioning and socio-environmental factors with healthcare transition outcomes. Adolescents aged 15-18 years who had neurocognitive testing and completed a visit with an adult provider were included. Transition outcomes included transfer interval from paediatric to adult care and retention in adult care at 12 and 24 months. Eighty adolescents (59% male, 64% HbSS/HbSbeta0 -thalassaemia) were included. Mean age at adult care transfer was 18 0 (+-0 3) years and transfer interval was 2 0 (+-2 3) months. Higher IQ (P = 0 02; PFDR  = 0 05) and higher verbal comprehension (P = 0 008; PFDR  = 0 024) were associated with <2 and <6 month transfer intervals respectively. Better performance on measures of attention was associated with higher adult care retention at 12 and 24 months (P = 0 009; PFDR  = 0 05 and P = 0 04; PFDR  = 0 12 respectively). Transfer intervals <6 months were associated with smaller households (P = 0 02; PFDR  = 0 06) and households with fewer children (P = 0 02; PFDR  = 0 06). Having a working parent was associated with less retention in adult care at 12 and 24 months (P = 0 01; P = 0 02 respectively). Lower IQ, verbal comprehension, attention difficulties and environmental factors may negatively impact transition outcomes. Neurocognitive function should be considered in transition planning for youth with SCD.
32977351	Phytomedicines (medicines derived from plants) for sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease, a common recessively inherited haemoglobin disorder, affects people from sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, Mediterranean basin, Indian subcontinent, Caribbean and South America. It is associated with complications and a reduced life expectancy. Phytomedicines (medicine derived from plants in their original state) encompass many of the plant remedies from traditional healers which the populations most affected would encounter. Laboratory research and limited clinical trials have suggested positive effects of phytomedicines both in vivo and in vitro. However, there has been little systematic appraisal of their benefits. This is an updated version of a previously published Cochrane Review. OBJECTIVES: To assess the benefits and risks of phytomedicines in people with sickle cell disease of all types, of any age, in any setting. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number Register (ISRCTN), the Allied and Complimentary Medicine Database (AMED), ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). Dates of most recent searches: Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 17 March 2020; ISRCTN: 19 April 2020; AMED: 18 May 2020; ClinicalTrials.gov: 24 April 2020; and the WHO ICTRP: 27 July 2017. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised or quasi-randomised trials with participants of all ages with sickle cell disease, in all settings, comparing the administration of phytomedicines, by any mode to placebo or conventional treatment, including blood transfusion and hydroxyurea. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Both authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: Three trials (212 participants) of three phytomedicines: Niprisan  (also known as Nicosan ), Ciklavit  and a powdered extract of Pfaffia paniculata were included. The Phase IIB (pivotal) trial suggests that Niprisan  may be effective in reducing episodes of severe painful sickle cell disease crisis over a six-month period (low-quality evidence). It did not appear to affect the risk of severe complications or the level of anaemia (low-quality evidence). The single trial of Cajanus cajan (Ciklavit ) reported a possible benefit to individuals with painful crises, and a possible adverse effect (non-significant) on the level of anaemia (low-quality evidence). We are uncertain of the effect of Pfaffia paniculata on the laboratory parameters and symptoms of SCD (very low-quality of evidence). No adverse effects were reported with Niprisan  and Pfaffia paniculata (low- to very low-quality evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: While Niprisan  appeared to be safe and effective in reducing severe painful crises over a six-month follow-up period, further trials are required to assess its role in managing people with SCD and the results of its multicentre trials are awaited. Currently, no conclusions can be made regarding the efficacy of Ciklavit  and the powdered root extract of Pfaffia paniculata in managing SCD. Based on the published results for Niprisan  and in view of the limitations in data collection and analysis of the three trials, phytomedicines may have a potential beneficial effect in reducing painful crises in SCD. This needs to be further validated in future trials. More trials with improved study design and data collection are required on the safety and efficacy of phytomedicines used in managing SCD.
31933169	Crizanlizumab: First Approval.	Crizanlizumab (Adakveo ; crizanlizumab-tmca) is an intravenously administered monoclonal antibody developed by Novartis Pharmaceuticals for the prevention of vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs) in patients with sickle cell disease. Crizanlizumab binds to P-selectin, thereby blocking its interaction with P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1. In November 2019, crizanlizumab received its first global approval in the USA, where it is indicated to reduce the frequency of VOCs in adults and paediatric patients aged >= 16 years with sickle cell disease. The drug is also under regulatory review in the EU for the prevention of VOCs in patients with sickle cell disease. The use of crizanlizumab (in combination with ruxolitinib) in myelofibrosis is also being evaluated in Australia, Spain, Germany and Hungary. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of crizanlizumab leading to this first approval for the reduction of VOCs in patients with sickle cell disease.
34259758	Dengue fever as a potential cause of sickle cell intrahepatic cholestasis: A report of two cases.	Sickle cell intrahepatic cholestasis is a potentially fatal syndrome characterized by jaundice, painful hepatomegaly, and organ dysfunction. Two cases of sickle cell intrahepatic cholestasis associated with dengue fever were described. Endothelial damage/dysfunction is a mechanism involved in severe hepatobiliary complications related to sickle cell diseases. However, the reasons for the lack of increase in the admission of patients with sickle cell disease having severe acute hepatobiliary complications triggered by endothelial damage/dysfunction due to dengue fever remain unknown. This study describes the first association between sickle cell intrahepatic cholestasis and dengue fever.

35471555	Risk of vaso-occlusive episode after exposure to corticosteroids in patients with sickle cell disease.	Vaso-occlusive episodes (VOEs) are a major concern in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Exposure to systemic corticosteroids has been suspected to increase the occurrence of VOEs in case reports or series. No comparative study has been conducted to investigate this risk, which is still debated. Several clinical trials demonstrated the effectiveness of corticosteroids for the treatment of VOEs, but with increased rates of readmission. The aim of the study was to assess the risk of hospitalization for VOE associated with exposure to systemic corticosteroids in patients with SCD. We used a case-case-time-control design in a nationwide population-based cohort built in the French national health insurance database between 2010 and 2018. The population included all patients with SCD with at least 1 hospitalization for VOE. Corticosteroids were identified using out-of-hospital dispensing data. The outcome was the first hospitalization for VOE. The case-case-time-control design induces self-adjustment for time-invariant confounders, including genotype. Analyses were adjusted for time-dependent confounders (infections, red blood transfusions) and stratified by exposure to hydroxyurea. Overall, 5151 patients were included in the main analysis. Corticosteroid exposure was significantly associated with the occurrence of hospitalizations for VOEs: adjusted odds ratio, 3.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.4-5.6). In patients exposed to hydroxyurea, the adjusted odds ratio was 2.6 (95% CI, 1.1-6.4); it was 4.0 (95% CI, 2.5-6.3) in unexposed patients. These results were consistent in children and adults. In conclusion, systemic corticosteroids were associated to an increased risk of hospitalization for VOEs and should be limited in patients with SCD.
34586618	Innovations in CRISPR-Based Therapies.	Gene and cell therapies have shown tremendous advancement in the last 5 years. Prominent examples include the successful use of CRISPR-edited stem cells for treating blood disorders like sickle cell anemia and beta-thalassemia, and ongoing clinical trials for treating blindness. This mini-review assesses the status of CRISPR-based therapies, both in vivo and ex vivo, and the challenges associated with clinical translation. In vivo CRISPR therapies have been used to treat eye and liver diseases due to the practicality of delivering editing components to the target tissue. In contrast, even though ex vivo CRISPR therapy involves cell isolation, expansion, and infusion, its advantages include characterizing the gene edits before infusion and restricting off-target effects in other tissues. Further, the safety, affordability, and feasibility of CRISPR therapies, especially for treating large number of patients, are discussed.
36273784	Long-Term Organ Function After HCT for SCD: A Report From the Sickle Cell Transplant Advocacy and Research Alliance.	Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is an established cure for sickle cell disease (SCD) supported by long-term survival, but long-term organ function data are lacking. We sought to describe organ function and assess predictors for dysfunction in a retrospective cohort (n = 247) through the Sickle cell Transplant Advocacy and Research alliance. Patients with <1-year follow-up or graft rejection/second HCT were excluded. Organ function data were collected from last follow-up. Primary measures were organ function, comparing pre- and post-HCT. Bivariable and multivariable analyses were performed for predictors of dysfunction. Median age at HCT was 9.4 years; the majority had HbSS (88.2%) and severe clinical phenotype (65.4%). Most received matched related (76.9%) bone marrow (83.3%) with myeloablative conditioning (MAC; 57.1%). Acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) developed in 24.0% and 24.8%. Thirteen patients (5.3%) died >=1 year after HCT, primarily from GVHD or infection. More post-HCT patients had low ejection or shortening fractions than pre-HCT (0.6%   6.0%, P = .007 and 0%   4.6%, P = .003). The proportion with lung disease remained stable. Eight patients (3.2%) had overt stroke; most had normal (28.3%) or stable (50.3%) brain magnetic resonance imaging. On multivariable analysis, cardiac dysfunction was associated with MAC (odds ratio [OR] = 2.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09-6.77; P = .033) and severe acute GVHD (OR = 2.41; 95% CI, 1.04-5.62; P = .041). Neurologic events were associated with central nervous system indication (OR = 2.88; 95% CI, 2.00-4.12; P < .001). Overall organ dysfunction was associated with age >=16 years (OR = 2.26; 95% CI, 1.35-3.78; P = .002) and clinically severe disease (OR = 1.64; 95% CI, 1.02-2.63; P = .043). In conclusion, our results support consideration of HCT at younger age and use of less intense conditioning.
36062975	Clinical outcome of pre-operative blood transfusion for sickle cell disease patients in post-operative complications.	BACKGROUND: Preoperative blood transfusion for patients with sickle cell disease is a debatable topic and it can be lifesaving. Sickle cell disease patients are at high risk for vaso-occlusive crisis due to the large concentration of sickle hemoglobin (HgbS) in their blood. Despite the current extensive research into this disease, there is still no consensus over whether blood transfusion is a preferable preoperative modality among patients undergoing elective surgical procedures. METHOD: A retrospective observational study, which enrolled 204 patients with Sickle cell disease who underwent surgery at King Fahad Hospital of the University (KFHU) over the last five years. The primary objective was to determine whether there is evidence that preoperative blood transfusion for SCD patients undergoing surgical procedures will reduce postoperative complications related to SCD. RESULTS: A total of 204 patients were included, of which 30% had preoperative blood transfusion. Majority of patient 44% had undergone cholecystectomy. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, patients who did not undergo blood transfusion had significantly higher risk to develop post-operative SCD complications (OR = 3.07, P value = 0.002). In addition, they had significantly prolonged hospitalization (OR = 2.22, P value = 0.08). In contrast, patients who received blood transfusion had lower risk for developing post-operative SCD-related complications (OR = 1.87, P value = 0.29), and decrease in the duration of hospitalization by (OR = 0.49, P value = 0.045). CONCLUSION: Our study showed that patients who had not undergone preoperative blood transfusion had higher risk to develop postoperative complications and prolonged hospital stay compared to those who underwent blood transfusion.
36273803	Clinical outcomes and 30-day readmissions associated with high-output heart failure.	BACKGROUND: High-output heart failure (HOHF) is an underdiagnosed type of heart failure (HF) characterized by low systemic vascular resistance and high cardiac output. OBJECTIVE: This study sought to characterize the causes, mortality, and readmissions related to HOHF within the United States. METHODS: Data were collected from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) National Readmissions Database (NRD) from January 1, 2017, to November 30, 2019. We used the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10), diagnostic codes to identify encounters with HOHF and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). RESULTS: Of the total 5,080,985 encounters with HF, 3,897 hospitalizations (mean age 62.5 +- 17.9 years, 56.5% females) with HOHF and 5,077,088 hospitalizations with HFrEF were recorded. The most commonly associated putative etiologies of HOHF included pulmonary disease (19.8%), morbid obesity (9.9%), sepsis (9.6%), cirrhosis (8.9%), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (7.9%), hyperthyroidism (5.5%), and sickle cell disease (3.3%). There was no significant difference in mortality rates [4.3% vs. 5.2%; odds ratio (OR) 0.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.7-1.2] between HOHF and HFrEF. However, the 30-day readmission rate for HOHF was significantly lower than that for HFrEF (5.7% vs. 21.2%; OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.30-0.51). Cardiovascular (39.9%) followed by hematological (20.6%) complications accounted for the majority of 30-day readmissions in the HOHF group. CONCLUSIONS: HOHF is an infrequently reported cardiovascular complication associated with noncardiovascular disorders and is encountered in 0.07% of all encounters with HF. Although comparable in-hospital mortality between studied cohorts was observed, raising awareness and timely recognition of this entity are warranted.
32758666	Viral metagenomics in Brazilian multiply transfused patients with sickle cell disease as an indicator for blood transfusion safety.	BACKGROUND AND AIM: Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) are submitted to multiple transfusions in order to increase the oxygen capacity of the blood, decrease blood viscosity, and suppress the sickling of the cells. Multiply transfused patients with SCD represent significant risk of acquiring parenterally transmitted infections. The analysis of the virome profile of high-risk multiply transfused patients with SCD can reveal the presence of parenterally transmitted viruses and therefore be used an indirect approach for evaluation of blood transfusion safety. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 45 patients with SCD receiving multiple transfusions and analyzed by metagenomic analyses. The samples were assembled in pools f which were submitted to nucleic acids extraction and sequencing by Illumina NextSeq 550 equipment. For bioinformatic analysis, we used a specific in-house developed pipeline specialized in identification of emerging viruses. RESULTS: The virome composition of SCD patients revealed the presence of commensal viruses represented by anelloviruses and Human Pegivirus-1 (HPgV-1, GB virus C). Contaminant viral sequences belonging to human lentiviruses (rev, env genes), cytomegalovirus and murine leukemia virus were also identified and are attributed to vectors used in the laboratory practice. No novel or unsuspected pathogenic viruses were identified. CONCLUSION: This study evaluates for the first time the virome of multiply transfused patients with SCD. Exclusively genetic material of commensal viruses was annotated. Therefore, we believe that viral metagenomics applied in patients with high risk for acquiring parenterally transmitted infections can serve as a direct indicator for evaluation of transfusion safety.
34727959	A systematic literature review of frequency of vaso-occlusive crises in sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a collection of rare inherited blood disorders affecting approximately 100,000 people in the U.S. and 20-25 million people globally. Individuals with SCD experience recurrent episodes of severe and unpredictable pain that are caused by vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs), a hallmark of the disease. VOCs are the primary cause of hospitalization in SCD, result in missed workdays and school days, and decrease quality of life (QoL). Although VOCs cause significant burden in the lives of individuals with SCD, there is no synthesis on the frequency of VOCs in the real world. This systematic literature review sought to identify literature describing the frequency of VOCs experienced by individuals with SCD in real-world settings. METHODS: MEDLINE and 6 congresses were searched (date range: January 1, 2000 to June 30, 2020). Studies were reviewed independently by two researchers. Studies assessing frequency or prevalence of VOCs or VOC-related outcomes were included. RESULTS: Of 1438 studies identified in the search, 52 met pre-specified inclusion and exclusion criteria. Reported frequency of VOCs varied widely ranging from a mean or median of 0 VOCs/year to 18.2 VOCs/year. The proportion of patients experiencing >= 3 VOCs/year ranged from 4 to 67% and the proportion of patients experiencing >= 5 VOCs/year ranged from 18 to 59%. Measures of VOC severity were limited, with 13 studies considering frequency of complicated VOCs and only 1 study reporting duration of VOC episodes. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to systematically assess published evidence pertaining to VOCs in real-world settings. Reported VOC frequency in real-world settings varied widely, with a majority of studies only considering VOCs managed in an inpatient or outpatient setting. Studies that considered VOCs managed at home reported a higher frequency of VOCs, suggesting that many studies may underestimate the frequency of VOCs. This systematic literature review (SLR) highlights the need for consistent reporting of (1) self-reported VOCs, including those managed at home, (2) definitions of VOCs, (3) complicated VOCs, and (4) duration of VOC episodes in literature.
31619251	Treatment patterns and economic burden of sickle-cell disease patients prescribed hydroxyurea: a retrospective claims-based study.	BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate sickle-cell disease (SCD) treatment patterns and economic burden among patients prescribed hydroxyurea (HU) in the US, through claims data. METHODS: SCD patients with pharmacy claims for HU were selected from the Medicaid Analytic Extracts (MAX) from January 1, 2009 - December 31, 2013. The first HU prescription during the identification period was defined as the index date and patients were required to have had continuous medical and pharmacy benefits for >=6 months baseline and 12 months follow-up periods. Patient demographics, clinical characteristics, treatment patterns, health care utilization, and costs were examined, and variables were analyzed descriptively. RESULTS: A total of 3999 SCD patients prescribed HU were included; the mean age was 19.24 years, most patients were African American (73.3%), and the mean Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) score was 0.6. Asthma (20.3%), acute chest syndrome (15.6%), and infectious and parasitic diseases (20%) were the most prevalent comorbidities. During the 12-month follow-up period, 58.9% (N = 2357) of patients discontinued HU medication. The mean medication possession ratio (MPR) was 0.52, and 22.3% of patients had MPR >=80%. The average length of stay (LOS) for SCD-related hospitalization was 13.35 days; 64% of patients had >=1 SCD-related hospitalization. The mean annual total SCD-related costs per patient were $27,779, mostly inpatient costs ($20,128). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the study showed the patients had significant unmet needs manifest as poor medication adherence, high treatment discontinuation rates, and high economic burden.

37865561	Attitudes and Beliefs of Nurses and Nurse Assistants toward Patients with Sickle Cell Disease: A Mixed Methods Study.	BACKGROUND: Pain experienced among individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD) is the primary requirement for hospitalization. PURPOSE: This study examined the relationship of age, race, and years of experience among medical-surgical nurses and nursing assistants to their attitudes in caring for SCD patients and identified barriers that influence pain management care. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: An explanatory sequential mixed-methods study design was used. Online survey data were collected among 56 participants and online interviews were conducted among three participants. METHODS: The General Perceptions of Sickle Cell Patients (GPSCP) Scale-17, composed of four subscales, assessed providers attitudes toward patients with SCD. Two subscales assessed providers' attitudes behaviors related to acute and chronic pain management. RESULTS: There was no relationship between age and years of experience to scores on four subscales. White/Caucasian study participants scored higher on the Red Flag Behaviors subscale, indicating that White/Caucasian participants had stronger beliefs concerning drug-seeking behaviors among SCD patients as compared to other ethnicities/races. Themes generated from the qualitative interview data analysis were: 1) reflections on one's own practice compared to others' practice; 2) communication as a barrier/facilitator to providing care; 3) lack of national guidelines; and 4) adjunct staff are critical to facilitating holistic care. CONCLUSIONS: Racial and ethnic differences exist among medical-surgical nurses and nursing assistants' attitudes. Poor communication and lack of national standards of care are barriers to providing high quality care. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Culturally sensitive care, based on current practice guidelines, is needed for improved pain management care for patients with SCD.
32893265	Setting up and sustaining blood and marrow transplant services for children in middle-income economies: an experience-driven position paper on behalf of the EBMT PDWP.	Severe blood disorders and cancer are the leading cause of death and disability from noncommunicable diseases in the global pediatric population and a major financial burden. The most frequent of these conditions, namely sickle cell disease and severe thalassemia, are highly curable by blood or bone marrow transplantation (BMT) which can restore a normal health-related quality of life and be cost-effective. This position paper summarizes critical issues in extending global access to BMT based on ground experience in the start-up of several BMT units in middle-income countries (MICs) across South-East Asia and the Middle East where close to 700 allogeneic BMTs have been performed over a 10-year period. Basic requirements in terms of support systems, equipment, and consumables are summarized keeping in mind WHO's model essential lists and recommendations. BMT unit setup and maintenance costs are summarized as well as those per transplant. Low-risk BMT is feasible and safe in MICs with outcomes comparable to high-income countries but at a fraction of the cost. This report might be of assistance to health care institutions in MICs interested in developing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation services and strengthening context appropriate tertiary care and higher medical education.
32585325	Cardiovascular Risk and Cardiovascular Health Behaviours in the Transition From Childhood to Adulthood.	The prevention and management of cardiovascular risk factors during the transition from childhood to adulthood is critically important in defining cardiovascular health trajectories. Unfortunately, many young people fall out of clinical care during this important time, leading to worsening cardiovascular risk and missed opportunities to modify future outcomes. The field of health care transition has evolved to support young people with complex health needs in developing self-management and self-advocacy skills to promote positive health outcomes despite changes in health care providers and resources. While transitional care efforts are largely focused on childhood-onset chronic illnesses such as sickle cell disease and cystic fibrosis, young people with cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, obesity, and dyslipidemia also stand to benefit from structured supports to ensure continuity in care and positive health behaviours. On the backdrop of the broader health care transition literature, we offer practical insights and suggestions for ensuring that young people with cardiovascular risk factors experience uninterrupted high-quality care and support as they enter the adult health care system. Starting transition preparation in early adolescence, actively engaging all key stakeholders throughout the process, and remaining mindful of the developmental underpinnings and social context of transition are keys to success.
36096996	Umbilical cord blood as a hematopoietic stem cell source in transplantation for pediatric sickle cell disease: current challenges and strategies.	Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is the only established cure for sickle cell disease (SCD), a hemolytic disorder that arises due to a point mutation in the hemoglobin A gene. The result is an abnormal sickle hemoglobin (HbS) replacing hemoglobin A. Of the spectrum of sickle hemoglobinoapthies, homozygous (HbSS) and HbSbeta0 thalassemia manifest severe forms of disease characterized by chronic endothelial injury/vasculopathy, ischemic pain, and vital organ damage that commence in childhood and escalate with age resulting in impaired quality of life, increased healthcare burden, and early mortality. HSCT has demonstrated durable disease control and regression of symptoms. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched sibling donor (MSD) transplantation can achieve disease-free survival of > 90%. However, < 18% of SCD patients in the United States have a MSD. Familial mismatched and unrelated donors from registries provide alternate stem cell sources. Umbilical cord blood (UCB) from family or cord blood banks expand donor sources and are attractive due to donor-independent ease of use and availability. These naive cells tolerate greater degrees of HLA-mismatch. The primary challenge with UCB is optimizing cell dose toward successful engraftment and timely immune reconstitution while minimizing graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). This review summarizes evidence that UCB remains a promising stem cell source where modern methods of graft expansion, conditioning, GVHD prophylaxis, and infection control can overcome these challenges and retain the value of this intervention.
33010885	Risk factors for complications after abdominal surgery in children with sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Abdominal surgery in children with sickle cell disease (SCD) carries an increased risk of postoperative complications. Preoperative transfusions are frequently given to decrease the risk of vasoocclusive events. However, risk factors for postoperative complications are not well-defined in the pediatric population. METHODS: Pediatric patients with SCD undergoing common abdominal operations were identified from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program-Pediatric (NSQIP-P) database from 2012 to 2018. Outcomes of interest were the incidence rates of 1) any complication or readmission, and 2) serious SCD-related complications (stroke, new onset seizure, ventilator support >24 h postoperatively, or readmission with SCD crisis within 30 days of surgery). Patients were categorized by transfusion approach (transfusion within 48 h before surgery vs. no transfusion) and preoperative hematocrit (<21.0, 21.0-23.9, 24.0-26.9, 27.0-29.9, >=30.0). Stratified bivariate analyses and multivariable logistic regression were used to identify independent risk factors for complications. RESULTS: A total of 813 patients met inclusion criteria. There were 470 cholecystectomy, 251 splenectomy, 39 appendectomy, and 53 combination procedures; 13% of cases were urgent or emergent. Preoperative hematocrit levels were <21.0 in 3%, 21.0-23.9 in 10%, 24.0-26.9 in 17%, 27.0-29.9in 30%, and >=30.0 in 41% of patients; 52% received perioperative transfusion. The 30-day incidences of any complication/readmission and SCD-related complications were 12% and 4%, respectively. On bivariate analyses, urgent/emergent case status was the only significant predictor of complications, carrying risk of 20% and 8% for overall and SCD-related complications, respectively; this finding persisted on multivariable logistic regression (OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.0.2-3.29, p = 0.04). Neither preoperative transfusion nor preoperative hematocrit level was associated with complication risk, although there was a trend toward higher SCD-related complications in patients with preoperative hematocrit <21.0 (p = 0.07). CONCLUSION: In this large cohort of pediatric SCD patients undergoing abdominal surgery, there was no clear association between postoperative complications and the transfusion approach or the preoperative hematocrit level within the range above 21.0. Urgent/emergent surgical procedures carried a nearly two-fold higher complication risk compared to elective procedures. Future studies should prospectively evaluate preoperative transfusion approaches and compare immediate and delayed operative management to nonoperative management in this population. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III Retrospective review.
38426267	Causal Mediation of Neighborhood-Level Pediatric Hospitalization Inequities.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Population-wide racial inequities in child health outcomes are well documented. Less is known about causal pathways linking inequities and social, economic, and environmental exposures. Here, we sought to estimate the total inequities in population-level hospitalization rates and determine how much is mediated by place-based exposures and community characteristics. METHODS: We employed a population-wide, neighborhood-level study that included youth <18 years hospitalized between July 1, 2016 and June 30, 2022. We defined a causal directed acyclic graph a priori to estimate the mediating pathways by which marginalized population composition causes census tract-level hospitalization rates. We used negative binomial regression models to estimate hospitalization rate inequities and how much of these inequities were mediated indirectly through place-based social, economic, and environmental exposures. RESULTS: We analyzed 50 719 hospitalizations experienced by 28 390 patients. We calculated census tract-level hospitalization rates per 1000 children, which ranged from 10.9 to 143.0 (median 45.1; interquartile range 34.5 to 60.1) across included tracts. For every 10% increase in the marginalized population, the tract-level hospitalization rate increased by 6.2% (95% confidence interval: 4.5 to 8.0). After adjustment for tract-level community material deprivation, crime risk, English usage, housing tenure, family composition, hospital access, greenspace, traffic-related air pollution, and housing conditions, no inequity remained (0.2%, 95% confidence interval: -2.2 to 2.7). Results differed when considering subsets of asthma, type 1 diabetes, sickle cell anemia, and psychiatric disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide additional evidence supporting structural racism as a significant root cause of inequities in child health outcomes, including outcomes at the population level.
32010984	Maternal genetic disorders and fetal development.	With improvements in early diagnosis and management of genetic diseases, more women with genetic disorders are reaching reproductive age and becoming pregnant. While pregnancy can have a significant impact on a woman's health when there is an underlying genetic disorder, there can also be fetal effects, including embryopathy, fetal growth restriction, and brain injury. Some maternal genetic disorders are associated with adverse perinatal outcomes, including a high risk of perinatal loss and preterm birth. In this article, we review several maternal genetic disorders associated with fetal risk that are important for clinicians and patients to understand and manage appropriately. These include phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency and other inborn errors of metabolism, tuberous sclerosis complex, myotonic dystrophy, cystic fibrosis, Turner syndrome, sickle cell disease, and connective tissue disorders.
33545079	Hematopoietic-Stem-Cell-Targeted Gene-Addition and Gene-Editing Strategies for beta-hemoglobinopathies.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is caused by a well-defined point mutation in the beta-globin gene and therefore is an optimal target for hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene-addition/editing therapy. In HSC gene-addition therapy, a therapeutic beta-globin gene is integrated into patient HSCs via lentiviral transduction, resulting in long-term phenotypic correction. State-of-the-art gene-editing technology has made it possible to repair the beta-globin mutation in patient HSCs or target genetic loci associated with reactivation of endogenous gamma-globin expression. With both approaches showing signs of therapeutic efficacy in patients, we discuss current genetic treatments, challenges, and technical advances in this field.

32147052	Autonomically-mediated decrease in microvascular blood flow due to mental stress and pain in sickle cell disease: A target for neuromodulatory interventions.	Pain and vaso-occlusive crises (VOC) are hallmark complications of sickle cell disease (SCD) and result in significant physical and psychosocial impairment. The variability in SCD pain frequency and triggers for the transition from steady state to VOC are not well understood. This paper summarizes the harmful physiological effects of pain and emotional stressors on autonomically-mediated vascular function in individuals with SCD and the effects of a cognitive, neuromodulatory intervention (i.e. hypnosis) on microvascular blood flow. We reviewed recent studies from the authors' vascular physiology laboratory that assessed microvascular responses to laboratory stressors in individuals with SCD. Results indicate that participants with SCD exhibit marked neurally mediated vascular reactivity in response to pain, pain-related fear, and mental stress. Further, pilot study results show that engagement in hypnosis may attenuate harmful microvascular responses to pain. The collective results demonstrate that autonomically-mediated vascular responses to pain and mental stress represent an important SCD intervention target. This ongoing work provides physiological justification for the inclusion of cognitive, neuromodulatory and complementary treatments in SCD disease management and may inform the development of targeted, integrative interventions that prevent the enhancement of autonomic vascular dysfunction in SCD.

36173437	Modified DIVA Score: An Improved Clinical Predictive Tool for Detecting Difficult Access in Children.	OBJECTIVE: This study aims to validate the DIVA (Difficult Intravenous Access) score in our population and to identify any additional patient characteristics that may be associated with difficult access in children. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study in an urban quaternary pediatric emergency department with patients younger than 21 years and Emergency Severity Index >=2 who require intravenous (IV) access for their management. In addition to patient characteristics comprising the DIVA score, data were collected on patient "history of difficult access," hydration status, skin shade, history of sickle cell disease or diabetes, technology dependence, and body mass index. The number of IV cannulation attempts and total time taken were recorded for each patient. "Difficult access" was defined as >=2 or more attempts or time >30 minutes to achieve successful IV cannulation. RESULTS: A convenience sample of 300 pediatric patients was enrolled. The DIVA score had a sensitivity of 51% (95% confidence interval [CI], 40.8%-61.14%) and a specificity of 82.99% (95% CI, 76.95%-87.99%) for predicting "difficult access" in our population. Among all patient characteristics examined in this study, only "history of difficult access" improved the identification of "difficult access" patients. The "history of difficult access" variable had a sensitivity of 61% (95% CI, 50.7%-70.6%) and a specificity of 75.7% (95% 95% CI, 69.12%-81.62%) in predicting "difficult access." With the addition of "history of difficult access" to the original DIVA score, we developed a "modified DIVA score (m-DIVA)." The m-DIVA score had a sensitivity of 78% (95% CI, 68.6%-85.6%) and specificity of 67% (95% CI, 59.9%-73.58%), representing a 52.9% improvement in correctly identifying "difficult access" patients over the original DIVA score. CONCLUSIONS: The m-DIVA score, which incorporates prior history, increases the screening test's sensitivity in identifying "difficult access" patients and should be further investigated as clinical tool.

38015105	Intravenous fluid therapy and hospital outcomes for vaso-occlusive episodes in children, adolescents, and young adults with sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: While intravenous fluid (IVF) therapy in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) admitted for a vaso-occlusive episode (VOE) can help reduce red blood cell sickling, clinical practice varies across institutions. We examined the relationship between IVF therapy and hospital length of stay (HLOS), as well as adverse events, such as acute chest syndrome (ACS), pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) transfer, and 28-day re-admission. METHODS: This is a single-center retrospective analysis of SCD VOE hospitalizations between January 2015 and April 2020. Patients with SCD, age 0-30, with consecutive hospitalizations for VOE were included. For the first 3 days of each admission, an "IVF ratio" was calculated by dividing actual IVF rate administered by weight-based maintenance IVF (mIVF) rate. RESULTS: A total of 617 hospitalizations for 161 patients were included. Mean HLOS was 5.7 days, (SD 3.9), and mean IVF volume over the first 3 days of admission was 139.6 mL/kg/day (SD 57.8). Multivariate analysis showed that for each additional 0.5 times the mIVF rate, HLOS increased by 0.53 day (p < .001; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.609-0.989), but there was no significant association between IVF therapy and adverse events. History of chronic pain was associated with increased odds of re-admission (OR 6.4; 95% CI: 3.93-10.52). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the theoretical potential for IVF therapy to slow down the sickling process, our findings suggest that increased IVF therapy was associated with prolonged HLOS, which places a burden on patients, families, and the health system.
37863704	Debate: Should the loss of disability adjusted life years (DALY) define the focus of Global Hematology?: The case for prioritizing capacity building in anemia management and blood transfusion.	Setting priorities in healthcare is always contentious given the array of possible services at primary, secondary, and tertiary levels of care, not to mention potential public health interventions. The central goals in global policy have been reducing inequity within and between countries, protecting vulnerable groups (particularly women and children) and reducing the major communicable diseases which have historically been a major burden in lower- and middle-income countries. Here limited relative and absolute spending on healthcare have spurred a series of initiatives in Global Health over the last 50 years which have led to significant gains in measures of morbidity and mortality. Against this background there remains the continuing question of how to adapt current medical practice in higher income countries for training and planning of services in lower- and middle-income countries. Here, the historical development of Global Health is outlined, and lessons drawn from the surveys of the global burden of disease and health economic analysis to understand how we can apply these principles to define Global Hematology. It remains likely that in lower-income countries effort should be concentrated on developing laboratory services and blood transfusion, to allow safe and effective support for the assessment of treatment of anemia, sickle cell disease, maternal and child health and urgent surgery and obstetric services. However, the principles of Global Health, could also be used for hematological malignancies to develop a framework for Global Hematology for all settings.
36718836	The management of chronic pain in sickle cell disease: an interview with Nadine Matthie.	Nadine Matthie, PhD, RN, CNL is an Assistant Professor in the Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing at Emory University in Atlanta, GA, USA. As a nurse scientist, she has conducted behavioral research to investigate pain and self-management in adults living with sickle cell disease, and address chronic, non vaso-occlusive pain in this population. Dr Matthie is developing non pharmacological, patient-centered, self-management strategies that incorporate virtual reality and biopsychosocial approaches to help manage chronic pain and reduce the burden of sickle cell; thereby, facilitating new, personalized approaches to management of chronic pain conditions in the home setting. Her research has been published in several national and international peer-reviewed sources for various disciplines, including nursing, medicine, music therapy and psychology.
37883803	Cerebral hemodynamic changes after haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplant in adults with sickle cell disease.	Preliminary evidence from four adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) suggests that hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) improves cerebral hemodynamics. HSCT largely normalizes cerebral hemodynamics in children with SCD. We tested the hypothesis in adults with SCD that cerebral blood flow (CBF), oxygen extraction fraction (OEF), and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) measured using MRI, normalized to healthy values, comparing measurements approximately one month before to 12-24 months following HSCT (n=11; age=33.3+-8.9 years; 389+-150 days post-HSCT) to age-, race- and sex-matched values from healthy adults without sickle trait (n=28; age=30.2+-5.6 years). Prior to transplant, 7 patients had neurological indications for transplant (e.g., overt stroke) and 4 had non-neurological reasons for haploidentical bone marrow transplant (haploBMT). All received haploBMT from first-degree relatives (parent, sibling, or child donor) with reduced-intensity preparation and maintained engraftment. Pre-transplant, CBF was elevated (CBF=69.11 24.7 ml/100g/min) compared to controls (p = 0.004). Mean CBF declined significantly following haploBMT (post-transplant CBF=48.2+-13.9 ml/100g/min, p=0.003). OEF was not different from controls at baseline and did not change significantly following HaploBMT (pre-transplant: 43.1 6.7%; post-transplant: 39.6 7.0%, p=0.34). Post-transplant, CBF and OEF were not significantly different from controls (CBF=48.2 13.4 ml/100g/min; p=0.78, and OEF=39.6 7.0%; p>0.99). CMRO2 did not change significantly following haploBMT (pre-transplant=3.18 0.87 ml O2/100g/min; post-transplant: 2.95 0.83; p=0.56). Major complications of haploBMT included one infection-related death and one severe chronic graft versus host disease. HaploBMT in adults with SCD reduces CBF to control values and maintains OEF and CMRO2 on average at levels observed in healthy adult controls.
32681734	Muscle structural, energetic and functional benefits of endurance exercise training in sickle cell disease.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) patients display skeletal muscle hypotrophy, altered oxidative capacity, exercise intolerance and poor quality of life. We previously demonstrated that moderate-intensity endurance training is beneficial for improving muscle function and quality of life of patients. The present study evaluated the effects of this moderate-intensity endurance training program on skeletal muscle structural and metabolic properties. Of the 40 randomized SCD patients, complete data sets were obtained from 33. The training group (n = 15) followed a personalized moderate-intensity endurance training program, while the non-training (n = 18) group maintained a normal lifestyle. Biopsies of the vastus lateralis muscle and submaximal incremental cycling tests were performed before and after the training program. Endurance training increased type I muscle fiber surface area (P = .038), oxidative enzyme activity [citrate synthase, P < .001; beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, P = .009; type-I fiber cytochrome c oxidase, P = .042; respiratory chain complex IV, P = .017] and contents of respiratory chain complexes I (P = .049), III (P = .005), IV (P = .003) and V (P = .002). Respiratory frequency, respiratory exchange ratio, blood lactate concentration and rating of perceived exertion were all lower at a given submaximal power output after training vs non-training group (all P < .05). The muscle content of proteins involved in glucose transport and pH regulation were unchanged in the training group relative to the non-training group. The moderate-intensity endurance exercise program improved exercise capacity and muscle structural and oxidative properties. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT02571088.
32250453	Interventions for preventing silent cerebral infarcts in people with sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the commonest severe monogenic disorders in the world, due to the inheritance of two abnormal haemoglobin (beta globin) genes. SCD can cause severe pain, significant end-organ damage, pulmonary complications, and premature death. Silent cerebral infarcts are the commonest neurological complication in children and probably adults with SCD. Silent cerebral infarcts also affect academic performance, increase cognitive deficits and may lower intelligence quotient. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of interventions to reduce or prevent silent cerebral infarcts in people with SCD. SEARCH METHODS: We searched for relevant trials in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the Transfusion Evidence Library (from 1980), and ongoing trial databases; all searches current to 14 November 2019. We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register: 07 October 2019. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials comparing interventions to prevent silent cerebral infarcts in people with SCD. There were no restrictions by outcomes examined, language or publication status. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. MAIN RESULTS: We included five trials (660 children or adolescents) published between 1998 and 2016. Four of the five trials were terminated early. The vast majority of participants had the haemoglobin (Hb)SS form of SCD. One trial focused on preventing silent cerebral infarcts or stroke; three trials were for primary stroke prevention and one trial dealt with secondary stroke prevention. Three trials compared the use of regular long-term red blood cell transfusions to standard care. Two of these trials included children with no previous long-term transfusions: one in children with normal transcranial doppler (TCD) velocities; and one in children with abnormal TCD velocities. The third trial included children and adolescents on long-term transfusion. Two trials compared the drug hydroxyurea and phlebotomy to long-term transfusions and iron chelation therapy: one in primary prevention (children), and one in secondary prevention (children and adolescents). The quality of the evidence was moderate to very low across different outcomes according to GRADE methodology. This was due to trials being at high risk of bias because they were unblinded; indirectness (available evidence was only for children with HbSS); and imprecise outcome estimates. Long-term red blood cell transfusions versus standard care Children with no previous long-term transfusions and higher risk of stroke (abnormal TCD velocities or previous history of silent cerebral infarcts) Long-term red blood cell transfusions may reduce the incidence of silent cerebral infarcts in children with abnormal TCD velocities, risk ratio (RR) 0.11 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 to 0.86) (one trial, 124 participants, low-quality evidence); but make little or no difference to the incidence of silent cerebral infarcts in children with previous silent cerebral infarcts on magnetic resonance imaging and normal or conditional TCDs, RR 0.70 (95% CI 0.23 to 2.13) (one trial, 196 participants, low-quality evidence). No deaths were reported in either trial. Long-term red blood cell transfusions may reduce the incidence of: acute chest syndrome, RR 0.24 (95% CI 0.12 to 0.49) (two trials, 326 participants, low-quality evidence); and painful crisis, RR 0.63 (95% CI 0.42 to 0.95) (two trials, 326 participants, low-quality evidence); and probably reduces the incidence of clinical stroke, RR 0.12 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.49) (two trials, 326 participants, moderate-quality evidence). Long-term red blood cell transfusions may improve quality of life in children with previous silent cerebral infarcts (difference estimate -0.54; 95% confidence interval -0.92 to -0.17; one trial; 166 participants), but may have no effect on cognitive function (least squares means: 1.7, 95% CI -1.1 to 4.4) (one trial, 166 participants, low-quality evidence). Transfusions continued versus transfusions halted: children and adolescents with normalised TCD velocities (79 participants; one trial) Continuing red blood cell transfusions may reduce the incidence of silent cerebral infarcts, RR 0.29 (95% CI 0.09 to 0.97 (low-quality evidence). We are very uncertain whether continuing red blood cell transfusions has any effect on all-cause mortality, Peto odds ratio (OR) 8.00 (95% CI 0.16 to 404.12); or clinical stroke, RR 0.22 (95% CI 0.01 to 4.35) (very low-quality evidence). The trial did not report: comparative numbers for SCD-related adverse events; quality of life; or cognitive function. Hydroxyurea and phlebotomy versus transfusions and chelation Primary prevention, children (121 participants; one trial) We are very uncertain whether switching to hydroxyurea and phlebotomy has any effect on: silent cerebral infarcts (no infarcts); all-cause mortality (no deaths); risk of stroke (no strokes); or SCD-related complications, RR 1.52 (95% CI 0.58 to 4.02) (very low-quality evidence). Secondary prevention, children and adolescents with a history of stroke (133 participants; one trial) We are very uncertain whether switching to hydroxyurea and phlebotomy has any effect on: silent cerebral infarcts, Peto OR 7.28 (95% CI 0.14 to 366.91); all-cause mortality, Peto OR 1.02 (95%CI 0.06 to 16.41); or clinical stroke, RR 14.78 (95% CI 0.86 to 253.66) (very low-quality evidence). Switching to hydroxyurea and phlebotomy may increase the risk of SCD-related complications, RR 3.10 (95% CI 1.42 to 6.75) (low-quality evidence). Neither trial reported on quality of life or cognitive function. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We identified no trials for preventing silent cerebral infarcts in adults, or in children who do not have HbSS SCD. Long-term red blood cell transfusions may reduce the incidence of silent cerebral infarcts in children with abnormal TCD velocities, but may have little or no effect on children with normal TCD velocities. In children who are at higher risk of stroke and have not had previous long-term transfusions, long-term red blood cell transfusions probably reduce the risk of stroke, and other SCD-related complications (acute chest syndrome and painful crises). In children and adolescents at high risk of stroke whose TCD velocities have normalised, continuing red blood cell transfusions may reduce the risk of silent cerebral infarcts. No treatment duration threshold has been established for stopping transfusions. Switching to hydroxyurea with phlebotomy may increase the risk of silent cerebral infarcts and SCD-related serious adverse events in secondary stroke prevention. All other evidence in this review is of very low-quality.
36729453	Comparisons of Severe Maternal Morbidity and Other Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes in Pregnant People With Sickle Cell Disease vs Anemia.	Importance: Pregnancy in sickle cell disease (SCD) is high risk, but whether prenatal anemia, which is treatable with red blood cell transfusions, is a mediator associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs) is not known. Objective: To compare rates and odds of severe maternal morbidity (SMM) and other APOs in pregnancies among individuals with SCD vs those without SCD but with prenatal anemia. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study was conducted using data from 2012 to 2018 from the National Inpatient Sample, a nationally representative sample of 20% of acute hospital admissions in the United States. All admissions with codes for delivery of a pregnancy among people aged 11 to 55 years were included. Only admissions coded with Black race were included. Data were analyzed from September 2021 through August 2022. Exposures: Prenatal anemia and SCD. Main Outcomes and Measures: SMM was tabulated per the Center for Disease Control and Prevention SMM Index alongside other APOs. Multiple logistic regression was used to compare the odds for APOs and risk ratios (RRs) to compare rates of APOs. Results: Among 764 455 total delivery admissions among patients identified as Black (mean [SD] age at delivery, 27.00 [6.08] years), 3200 deliveries were coded with maternal SCD, 34 808 deliveries were coded with maternal anemia, and 726 447 deliveries were control. Most patients were publicly insured (499 060 [65.4%]). For most outcomes, including SMM and mortality per 10 000 deliveries, the SCD group had higher rates (SMM: 5.9%; 95% CI, 5.1%-6.8%; maternal mortality: 13.0 deaths; 95% CI, 4.9 to 35.0 deaths) than anemia (SMM: 2.1%; 95% CI, 2.0%-2.3%; maternal mortality: 0.9 deaths; 95% CI, 0.3 to 2.8 deaths) or control groups (SMM: 1.1%; 95% CI, 1.0%-1.1%; maternal mortality: 1.2 deaths; 95% CI, 1.0 to 1.5 deaths). SCD (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 5.51; 95% CI, 4.71-6.45) and anemia groups (aOR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.84-2.17) had higher adjusted odds of SMM compared with the control group. However, for many complications associated with ischemia or abnormal placentation, CIs of aORs for SCD and anemia groups overlapped (eg, eclampsia: aOR, 2.74; 95% CI, 1.51-4.96 vs aOR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.08-1.81). For these complications, RRs for SCD vs anemia were between 1.0 and 2.1 (eg, eclampsia: 1.76; 95% CI, 0.93-3.32). For complications associated with thrombosis or SCD-specific pathologies, rates and aORs were greater for the SCD vs anemia group. For these complications, RRs were between 3.70 and 10.90. For example, rates of acute respiratory distress syndrome, including acute chest syndrome, were 56 of 3144 deliveries (1.8%) vs 122 of 34 686 deliveries (0.4%), and the RR was 4.99 (95% CI, 3.65-6.84). Conclusions and Relevance: This study found that risks associated with prenatal anemia and SCD were similar for many APOs, especially those associated with ischemia and abnormal placentation, suggesting that prenatal anemia may be a mediator associated with pregnancy risk in individuals with SCD.
32892842	Transfusion support in patients with sickle cell disease.	Blood transfusions are an integral component of the management of acute and chronic complications of sickle cell disease. Red cells can be administered as a simple transfusion, part of a modified exchange procedure involving manual removal of autologous red cells and infusion of donor red cells, and part of an automated red cell exchange procedure using apheresis techniques. Individuals with sickle cell disease are at risk of multiple complications of blood transfusions, including transfusional hemosiderosis, auto- and alloimmunization to minor red cell and human leukocyte antigens, delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions, and hyper-hemolysis. In low- and middle-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa, where a directed donor system is prevalent and limited laboratory methods are in place to perform extended red cell phenotyping, leukodepletion of cellular products, and infectious disease screening, there are additional challenges to providing safe and adequate transfusion support for this patient population. We review current indications for acute and chronic transfusions in sickle cell disease that are derived primarily from randomized controlled trials and observational studies in children living in high-income countries. We will highlight populations with unique transfusion needs, such as pregnant women and children, as well as the role of the transfusion medicine consultative service for individuals with sickle cell disease planning to have curative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or gene therapy. Finally, we will discuss risk factors for alloimmunization in individuals with sickle cell disease, emerging new strategies to prevent alloimmunization in this population, and critical gaps in the implementation of transfusion guidelines for sickle cell disease in high- and low-income countries.
36775794	Complementary and alternative medicine for children with sickle cell disease: A systematic review.	BACKGROUND: Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is a popular alternative to opioid and other analgesics in sickle cell disease (SCD). We review the effectiveness, prevalence, and factors associated with CAM use in the pediatric SCD population. METHODS: The review protocol was created based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. A literature search was conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Web of Science. RESULTS: Twenty-four studies were examined. The prevalence of CAM use in pediatric patients with SCD ranged from 36 to 84.5%. Common inpatient CAM interventions were yoga, virtual reality, and acupuncture, which decreased pain scale scores. Outpatient CAMs were consisted of cognitive behavioral therapy, massage therapy, and guided-imagery, which increased pain tolerability and decreased pain scale scores. CONCLUSIONS: CAM modalities can decrease pain scale scores. However, the impact of specific CAM modalities on emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and school absences were inconclusive.

32928458	The Effect of Use of Individualized Pain Plans in Sickle Cell Patients Presenting to the Emergency Department.	STUDY OBJECTIVE: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited hematologic disorder that affects approximately 100,000 US individuals and results in greater than 200,000 emergency department (ED) visits annually in the United States, with pain being the most common complaint. The objective of this retrospective study is to determine the effect of implementing individualized pain plans in the treatment of patients with SCD in the ED on time to first opioid, length of stay, and disposition. METHODS: At The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, a multidisciplinary group including hematologists and ED physicians was formed and enacted a protocol for using individualized pain plans, with the goal of decreasing time to treatment for patients with SCD who presented to the ED with chief complaint of pain. In this retrospective study, data from the year before through the year of implementation were gathered. Generalized linear models were fit to compare time to first opioid, length of stay, and disposition before and after protocol implementation. RESULTS: Data showed a 48% decrease in time to first opioid and a 22% decrease in length of ED stay after protocol implementation. No significant change was found in disposition or length of inpatient admission before and after protocol initiation. CONCLUSION: The use of individualized pain plans in the treatment of patients with SCD in the ED is a useful method of not only ensuring rapid and adequate treatment but also decreasing use of health care resources.
33560399	Allogeneic stem cell transplantation with omidubicel in sickle cell disease.	Many patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) do not have HLA-matched related donors for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Unrelated cord blood (UCB) is an alternative graft option but is historically associated with high graft failure rates, with inadequate cell dose a major limitation. Omidubicel is a nicotinamide-based, ex vivo-expanded UCB product associated with rapid engraftment in adults with hematologic malignancies. We hypothesized that increasing the UCB cell dose with this strategy would lead to improved engraftment in pediatric patients undergoing myeloablative HSCT for SCD. We report the outcomes of a phase 1/2 study in 13 patients with severe SCD who received omidubicel in combination with an unmanipulated UCB graft and 3 who received a single omidubicel graft. Grafts were minimally matched with patients at 4 of 6 HLA alleles. Median age at transplant was 13 years. A median CD34+ expansion of ~80-fold was observed in omidubicel and led to rapid neutrophil engraftment (median, 7 days). Long-term engraftment was derived from the unmanipulated graft in most of the double cord blood recipients. Two of the 3 single omidubicel recipients also had sustained engraftment. Incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was high, but resolved in all surviving patients. Event-free survival in the double cord group was 85% (median follow-up 4 years). All 3 patients in the single cord group were alive at 1 year after transplantation. Ex vivo expansion of UCB with omidubicel supports engraftment in patients with SCD. This approach to decreasing the incidence of GVHD should be optimized for general use in patients with SCD. This study was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT01590628.
36377997	The Frequencies of ABO and Rh Phenotypes among Male Blood Donors in Northwestern Saudi Arabia.	BACKGROUND: Transfusion-dependent patients in Saudi Arabia are numerous because of the existence of life-threatening inherited diseases such as sickle cell anemia and thalassemia. Thus, analysis of the frequencies of the ABO and rhesus (Rh) phenotypes is vital. This study sought to evaluate the frequencies of the ABO and Rh phenotypes among male blood donors in Hail region. METHODS: One hundred and twenty-six (126) blood samples were collected from male donors living in Hail region and were screened for ABO and Rh phenotypes. The collected data were statistically analyzed using GraphPad Prism (version 9.3.1). RESULTS: Among 126 blood donors, 43.6% were classified into the O blood group. Additionally, Rh antigen e was predominantly detected in this study (99.2%). A total of 103 blood donors exhibited D antigen, whereas 23 were negative for D antigen. The DCe/dce (R1r) phenotype was observed in 29.1% of RhD positive donors, while 73.9% of RhD negative blood donors expressed the dce/dce (rr) phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: The O phenotype and e antigen were most frequently observed in male blood donors from Hail province. RhD positive samples took advantage of total blood donor samples over RhD negative samples. CcDee (R1r) phenotype was commonly identified in the RhD positive population, whereas ccddee (rr) phenotype was consis tently detected in the RhD negative male donors.
34795732	Burden of iron overload among non-chronically blood transfused preschool children with sickle cell anaemia.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease is the commonest genetic disorder of haemoglobin due to inheritance of mutant haemoglobin genes from both parents. The disorder is characterized by chronic haemolysis which results in increased availability of iron from red blood cell destructions. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of iron overload among non-chronically blood transfused preschool children with sickle cell anaemia. METHODS: Serum ferritin was assayed and transferrin saturation derived in 97 steady state sickle cell anaemia children. Elevated iron stores were defined as serum ferritin level >300ng/ml, and transferrin saturation >45%. RESULTS: Serum ferritin level was greater than 300 mg/ml in 14 (14.4%) subjects and transferrin saturation >45% in six (6.2%) subjects with sickle cell anaemia. The prevalence of iron overload was 20.6%. The prevalence of iron overload was higher among subjects in older age group, female, with history of blood transfusion, and with single blood transfusion session. CONCLUSION: Iron overload is prevalent in older children; the number of blood transfusion sessions notwithstanding. Regular assessment of serum ferritin is recommended.
37772453	The association of sickle cell disorder with adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients: A meta-analysis.	The aim is to elucidate the relationship between sickle cell disorder and severe COVID-19. We systematically searched the required articles in three electronic databases, extracting and pooling effect sizes (ES) and 95% confidence interval (CI) from each eligible study to evaluate the effect of combined sickle cell disorder on adverse consequences in patients with COVID-19. This meta-analysis included 21 studies. Sickle cell disease (SCD) was a risk factor for mortality (pooled ES = 1.70, 95% CI: 1.00-2.92, p = 0.001), hospitalization (pooled ES = 6.21, 95% CI: 3.60-10.70, p = 0.000) and intensive care unit (ICU) admission (pooled ES = 2.29, 95% CI: 1.61-3.24, p = 0.099) in COVID-19 patients. Patients with SCD had an increased risk of respiratory failure/mechanical ventilation, but a statistical association was not found (pooled ES = 1.21, 95%CI: 0.74-1.98, p = 0.036). There was significant heterogeneity between SCD and death, hospitalization, and respiratory failure/mechanical ventilation. The results of meta-regression of SCD and hospitalization suggested that the tested variables including Area (p = 0.642), study design (p = 0.739), sample size (p = 0.397), proportion of males (p = 0.708), effect type (p = 0.723), whether confounding factors are adjusted (p = 0.606) might not be the source of heterogeneity. In addition, sickle cell trait (SCT) was significantly associated with the mortality (pooled ES = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.28-1.85, p = 0.771) and hospitalization (pooled ES = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.07-1.35,p = 0.519) in patients with COVID-19. But any increased risk of ICU admission/severe (pooled ES = 1.24, 95% CI: 0.95-1.62, p = 0.520) and mechanical ventilation (OR = 1.00, 95%CI:0.59-1.69) in COVID-19 patients with SCT was not observed. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the results were robust. The results of the funnel plot and Egger's test did not support the existence of publication bias. Current meta-analysis indicated that sickle cell disorder has a meaningful impact on COVID-19 progression to severe cases and associated deaths. However, further investigations and research to validate the current findings is indispensable.
32142138	Opioid Prescription Filling Trends Among Children with Sickle Cell Disease After the Release of State-Issued Guidelines on Pain Management.	OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of Ohio's 2012, 2013, and 2016 opioid prescribing guidelines on opioid and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) prescription filling and health care utilization for pain among children with sickle cell disease (SCD). DESIGN: Quasi-experimental retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Ohio Medicaid claims data from August 2011 to August 2016. SUBJECTS: Medicaid beneficiaries under age 19 years with SCD. METHODS: Interrupted time series analyses comparing population-level rates of opioids and NSAID prescriptions filled, standardized amounts of opioids dispensed, and acute health care utilization for pain before and after release of each guideline. RESULTS: In our cohort of 1,505 children with SCD, there was a temporary but significant decrease in the opioid filling rate (-2.96 prescriptions per 100 children, P = 0.01) and in the amount of opioids dispensed (-31.39 milligram morphine equivalents per filled prescription, P < 0.001) after the 2013 guideline but a temporary but significant increase in the opioid filling rate (7.44 prescriptions per 100 children, P < 0.001) and in the amount of opioids dispensed (72.73 mg morphine equivalents per filled prescription, P < 0.001) after the 2016 guideline. The NSAID filling rate did not significantly change after any of the guidelines. Acute health care utilization rates for pain after the 2016 guideline were similar to those before the 2013 guideline (rate ratio = 1.04, P = 0.63). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that Ohio's 2013 and 2016 guidelines were associated with significant but nonsustained changes in opioid prescription filling among children with SCD. Additional studies are needed to confirm that opioid guidelines have a sustained impact on excessive opioid prescribing, filling, and misuse.
34714833	Sex-based differences in the manifestations and complications of sickle cell disease: Report from the Sickle Cell Disease Implementation Consortium.	INTRODUCTION: Sex-based clinical outcome differences in sickle cell disease (SCD) remain largely unknown despite evidence that female sex is associated with an increased lifespan. To better characterize sex-based differences in SCD, we assessed pain, treatment characteristics, laboratory measures and complications among males and females currently enrolled in the Sickle Cell Disease Implementation Consortium (SCDIC) registry. METHODS: The SCDIC consists of eight comprehensive SCD centers and one data coordinating center that received funding from the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute to improve outcomes for individuals with SCD. Eligibility criteria included: 15 to 45 years of age and a confirmed diagnosis of SCD. Self-report surveys were completed and data were also abstracted from the participants' medical records. RESULTS: A total of 2,124 participants were included (mean age: 27.8 years; 56% female). The majority had hemoglobin SS SCD genotype. Females had worse reports of pain severity (mean (SD) T-score 51.6 (9.6) vs 49.3 (10), p<0.001), more vaso-occlusive episodes (p = 0.01) and a higher occurrence of 3 or more hospital admissions in the past year (30.9% vs. 25.5, p = 0.03). On multivariable analysis, males had higher odds of acute chest syndrome (odds ratio (OR) 1.4, p = 0.002), cardiovascular (OR 1.70, p<0.001) and musculoskeletal (OR 1.33, p = 0.0034) complications and lower odds of depression (OR 0.77, p = 0.0381). Females had higher fetal hemoglobin levels with and without hydroxyurea use (9.6% vs 8.5%, p = 0.03 and 3% vs 2.2%, p = 0.0005, respectively). CONCLUSION: Our data suggests that sex differences in clinical outcomes do occur among individuals with SCD. Future research needs to explore the mechanisms underlying these differences.
33472029	A "Shot in the Arm" for Sickle Cell Disease.	
32339311	Celocentesis for early prenatal diagnosis of hemoglobinopathy.	OBJECTIVE: Celocentesis is an invasive technique that can provide prenatal diagnosis of single-gene disorders, from as early as 7 weeks' gestation. The objective of this study was to examine the safety of celocentesis. METHODS: In this prospective study, celocentesis was performed for prenatal diagnosis of hemoglobinopathy in 402 singleton pregnancies in which both parents were carriers of beta-thalassemia or sickle cell disease trait. We assessed procedure-related maternal discomfort or pain, success of sampling and obtaining results, pregnancy outcome and postnatal follow-up. RESULTS: First, celocentesis was carried out at a median gestational age of 8.6 (range, 6.9-9.9) weeks and celomic fluid was successfully aspirated in 99.8% of cases. Second, 67% of women had no or only mild discomfort, 18% had moderate discomfort, 12% had mild-to-moderate pain and 3% had severe pain. Third, prenatal diagnosis from analysis of the celomic fluid was successful in 93.8% cases, and in the last 121 cases, it was always successful. Fourth, in all cases of successful sampling and analysis of celomic fluid, the diagnosis was concordant with results obtained from additional prenatal or postnatal testing. Fifth, in addition to diagnosis of hemoglobinopathy, quantitative fluorescence polymerase chain reaction analysis, which was performed to evaluate maternal contamination using several markers for chromosomes X, Y, 21, 18 and 13, led to the accurate diagnosis of chromosomal aneuploidy. Sixth, in all cases of an affected fetus diagnosed by celocentesis in which the parents chose termination of pregnancy, this was carried out < 10 weeks' gestation. Seventh, in 97.1% (298/307) of the continuing pregnancies there was live birth, in seven (2.3%) there was miscarriage and in two (0.7%) there was loss to follow-up. Eighth, fetal abnormalities were diagnosed in three (1%) cases, including unilateral transverse amputation of the forearm, unilateral moderate hydronephrosis and small-bowel duplication. All neonates were examined by a pediatrician and were found to be phenotypically normal, except for the three cases with a prenatally diagnosed defect. CONCLUSIONS: Celocentesis can be used for early prenatal diagnosis of genetic abnormalities, and the procedure-related risk of pregnancy complications appears to be low. Copyright   2020 ISUOG.

35737751	Optimizing haematopoietic stem and progenitor cell apheresis collection from plerixafor-mobilized patients with sickle cell disease.	We adjusted haematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) apheresis collection from patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) by targeting deep buffy coat collection using medium or low collection preference (CP), and by increasing anticoagulant-citrate-dextrose-solution A dosage. In 43 HSPC collections from plerixafor-mobilized adult patients with SCD, we increased the collection efficiency to 35.79% using medium CP and 82.23% using low CP. Deep buffy coat collection increased red blood cell contamination of the HSPC product, the product haematocrit was 4.7% with medium CP and 6.4% with low CP. These adjustments were well-tolerated and allowed efficient HSPC collection from SCD patients.
36890729	Longitudinal effect of disease-modifying therapy on left ventricular diastolic function in children with sickle cell anemia.	Cardiac abnormalities seen in sickle cell anemia (SCA) include diastolic dysfunction, which has been shown to be associated with high morbidity and early mortality. The effect of disease-modifying therapies (DMT) on diastolic dysfunction is poorly understood. We prospectively evaluated the effects of hydroxyurea and monthly erythrocyte transfusions on diastolic function parameters over 2 years. A total of 204 subjects with HbSS or HbSbeta0-thalassemia (mean age 11 +- 3.7 years), unselected for disease severity, had diastolic function assessed with surveillance echocardiograms twice, 2 years apart. During this 2-year observation period, 112 participants received DMTs (hydroxyurea, n = 72, monthly erythrocyte transfusions, n = 40), 34 initiated hydroxyurea, and 58 did not receive any DMT. The entire cohort showed an increase in left atrial volume index (LAVi) of 3.40 +- 10.86 mL/m2, p = .001 over 2 years. This increase in LAVi was independently associated with anemia, high baseline E/e' or LV dilation. Individuals not exposed to DMT were younger (mean age 8.8 +- 2.9 years), but at baseline their prevalence of abnormal diastolic parameters was similar to that of the DMT-exposed participants who were older (mean age 12 +- 3.8 years). Participants on DMTs saw no improvement in diastolic function over the study period. In fact, participants on hydroxyurea saw a possible worsening in diastolic parameters (14% increase in LAVi and ~5% decrease in septal e') but also a ~9% decrease in fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels. Further studies are needed to evaluate if exposure to DMT for a longer duration or achieving higher HbF might be beneficial in alleviating diastolic dysfunction.
37438880	Predisposing factors for advanced liver fibrosis in patients with sickle cell disease.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the most common monogenic disorders worldwide and liver complications are common in this group of patients. Our study aims to highlight the prevalence of chronic liver complications and the main predisposing factors for advanced liver fibrosis in SCD patients. For this purpose, 219 patients from eight Thalassemia and Sickle Cell Units across Greece enrolled in our study and history of liver related disease complications was recorded, as well as a full laboratory and imaging analysis concerning their liver function. 13.6% of the patients had advanced liver fibrosis. The presence of liver fibrosis was significantly correlated with advanced age, male gender, cholelithiasis and higher LDH, gamma-GT, INR, direct and indirect bilirubin levels. These patients had exhibited significantly more episodes of liver crises and acute intrahepatic cholestasis. No correlation was observed with right heart failure or previous viral hepatitis. Patients with advanced liver fibrosis were receiving a more intensive transfusion therapy for a longer period of time and had higher Liver Iron Concentration levels. Our study shows that liver complications and cirrhosis is a significant cause of morbidity in patients with SCD and it is primarily associated with intravascular hemolysis and vaso-occlusive phenomena and secondarily with iron overload.
32965032	Automated RBC Exchange has a greater effect on whole blood viscosity than manual whole blood exchange in adult patients with sickle cell disease.	BACKGROUND: Blood transfusion is the cornerstone treatment to reduce the clinical severity of sickle cell disease (SCD), but we need to maintain the haematocrit (Hct) within an acceptable range to avoid a deleterious increase in blood viscosity. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of manual versus automated red blood cell (RBC) Exchange on haematological parameters and blood viscosity. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This prospective, single-centre, open nonrandomized observational study included forty-three sickle cell patients: 12 had automated RBC Exchange and 31 manual RBC Exchange. Samples were collected in EDTA tubes just before and within one hour after the end of the RBC Exchange to measure the haematological parameters and blood viscosity. RESULTS: Both automated and manual RBC Exchange decreased haemoglobin S levels and leucocyte and platelet counts, but the decrease was greater for automated RBC Exchange. Manual RBC Exchange caused a significant rise in haematocrit and haemoglobin levels and did not change blood viscosity. In contrast, automated RBC Exchange decreased blood viscosity without any significant change in haematocrit and only a very slight increase in haemoglobin levels. The change in blood viscosity correlated with the modifications of haematocrit and haemoglobin levels, irrespective of the RBC Exchange procedure. When adjusted for the volume of RBC Exchange, the magnitude of change in each biological parameter was not different between the two procedures. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that the automated RBC Exchange provided greater haematological and haemorheological benefits than manual RBC Exchange, mainly because of the higher volume exchanged, suggesting that automated RBC Exchange should be favoured over manual RBC Exchange when possible and indicated.
38138299	Pain Control for Sickle Cell Crisis, a Novel Approach? A Retrospective Study.	Background and Objectives: Pain management poses a significant challenge for patients experiencing vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) in sickle cell disease (SCD). While opioid therapy is highly effective, its efficacy can be impeded by undesirable side effects. Local regional anesthesia (LRA), involving the deposition of a perineural anesthetic, provides a nociceptive blockade, local vasodilation and reduces the inflammatory response. However, the effectiveness of this therapeutic approach for VOC in SCD patients has been rarely reported up to now. The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a single-shot local regional anesthesia (LRA) in reducing pain and consequently enhancing the management of severe vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) in adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) unresponsive to conventional analgesic therapy. Materials and Methods: We first collected consecutive episodes of VOC in critical care (ICU and emergency room) for six months in 2022 in a French University hospital with a large population of sickle cell patients in the West Indies population. We also performed a systematic review of the use of LRA in SCD. The primary outcome was defined using a numeric pain score (NPS) and/or percentage of change in opioid use. Results: We enrolled nine SCD adults (28 years old, 4 females) for ten episodes of VOC in whom LRA was used for pain management. Opioid reduction within the first 24 h post block was -75% (50 to 96%). Similarly, the NPS decreased from 9/10 pre-block to 0-1/10 post-block. Five studies, including one case series with three patients and four case reports, employed peripheral nerve blocks for regional anesthesia. In general, local regional anesthesia (LRA) exhibited a reduction in pain and symptoms, along with a decrease in opioid consumption post-procedure. Conclusions: LRA improves pain scores, reduces opioid consumption in SCD patients with refractory pain, and may mitigate opioid-related side effects while facilitating the transition to oral analgesics. Furthermore, LRA is a safe and effective procedure.
37249608	Timing matters: An analysis of the relationship between red cell transfusion timing and hospitalization outcomes in sickle cell crisis patients using the National Inpatient Sample database.	Vaso-occlusive pain crisis is a debilitating complication of sickle cell disease (SCD) and it is the most common cause of hospitalization among these individuals. We studied the inpatient outcomes among patients admitted with sickle cell crisis based on the timing of red blood cell transfusion. In this retrospective study, we used the United States National Inpatient Sample (NIS) data for the year 2019, to identify adult patients hospitalized with the principal diagnosis of sickle cell crisis who received simple red blood cell transfusion during their hospitalization. Patients were divided into two groups. Those who received simple red cell transfusion within 24 hours of admission were classified as early transfusion. After adjusting for confounders, the mean adjusted length of stay for patients with early transfusion was significantly lower than those who received a late blood transfusion by 3.51 days (p-value < 0.001) along with a decrease in mean adjusted hospitalization charges and cost, by 25,487 and 4,505 United States Dollar (USD) respectively. The early red cell transfusion was also associated with a decrease in inpatient mortality, demonstrated by an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 0.19 (p-value 0.036), and a reduction in in-hospital sepsis, with an aOR of 0.28 (p-value < 0.001), however, no statistically significant difference was found between the two groups regarding acute respiratory failure requiring intubation, vasopressors requirement, acute kidney injury requiring dialysis and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. We recommend timely triage and reassessment to identify sickle cell crisis patients requiring blood transfusion. This intervention can notably affect the inpatient length of stay, resource utilization, and hospitalization outcomes.
34855316	Hepatobiliary Findings in Nigerian Children with Sickle Cell Anaemia.	INTRODUCTION: Hepatobiliary abnormalities occur commonly in sickle cell anaemia and these have been extensively reported in the adult patients. However, complications have been sparsely reported in children especially in the sub-Saharan African continent. This study aimed to highlight the hepatobiliary complications in this group of children using clinical examination, laboratory testing and abdominal ultrasonography. The challenges in a resource limited country are also highlighted. SUBJECTS, MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and thirty- four (134) children aged 1-18years with sickle cell anaemia in steady state were recruited into this crossectional study. Clinical history and physical examination obtained were documented. Relevant basic haematologic and biochemical indices (Full blood count, liver enzymes and viral markers for hepatitis B and C) and abdominal ultrasonographic parameters were documented for all the children. The relationship between the complications and possible risk factors (age, frequency of crisis and blood transfusions) were also documented. RESULT: Fifty-three (39.6%) of the children had hepatobiliary abnormalities. Chronic hepatitis B infection was the most prevalent complication (14.9%) seen followed by cholelithiasis (12.7%) and Hepatitis C infection (4.5%). Other complications identified were cholecystitis (3.0%), biliary sludge (1.5%), liver cirrhosis (0.7%). Age was significantly associated with viral hepatitis (p=0.003) and cholelithiasis (p=0.0007) and the conditions were more prevalent in the older age group. The hepatobilary complications were also more prevalent in the males. Frequent blood transfusions was significantly related to viral hepatitis (p=0.03). The use of hydroxyurea was not significantly related to any of the complications. CONCLUSION: Hepatobiliary abnormalities are prevalent in children with sickle cell anaemia. Clinical screening and the use of ultrasonography would aid early diagnosis and appropriate therapeutic intervention in this group of children.
34334096	Total Annual Economic Burden of Patients with Sickle Cell Disease in Steady State in Greece.	Sickle cell disease includes a group of congenital hemolytic anemias, all characterized by the predominance of Hb S (HBB: c.20A>T). The population movement due to economic migration or escape from conflict zones will further affect the health systems of countries by either increasing the number of patients or forcing countries to create care units for sickle cell disease patients. This will probably also increase the incidence of the disease in areas where their incidence and prevalence were previously low. In the present study, an attempt has been made to estimate the total annual cost of the treatment of sickle cell disease in Greece. This was the first attempt to calculate the total annual cost of treating sickle cell disease patients in a steady state. The annual cost of sickle cell disease was estimated to be $21,152,340.00 (US$25,219,300.41), without calculating the cost of hospitalization for severe complications. Since 2013, in Greece, a pharmaceutical expenditure limit (decreasing with the years) has been budgeted at $1,945,000,000.00 (US$2,318,965,150.00), annually. It is therefore calculated that approximately 1.0% of the budget allocated to pharmaceutical spending is used to treat patients with sickle cell disease.

33889266	Emergency department utilization for sickle cell disease in St. Vincent and the Grenadines.	INTRODUCTION: sickle cell disease (SCD) is a chronic illness. Individuals affected by this disease are at risk for lifelong complications including episodes of acute pain, chronic pain and multi-organ injury that leads to reduced quality of life and a shortened life span. There is a wealth of data on acute care utilization for SCD in the United States. However, data from the Caribbean region is limited. The objective of this study is to explore Emergency Department (ED) utilization for SCD in St. Vincent and the Grenadines by describing: i) the characteristics of SCD related ED encounters; ii) the urgency of these encounters as defined by resource utilization; iii) the disposition for these ED encounters. METHODS: the study was a cross-sectional study utilizing data from the ED log books at the Milton Cato Memorial Hospital (MCMH) during non-consecutive time periods between January 1st, 2012 - December 31st, 2016. RESULTS: there were 666 SCD-related ED encounters during the study period. Thirty-four percent of encounters resulted in hospitalization and 66% of encounters met criteria for an urgent visit. The most commonly reported diagnosis was vaso-occlusive crisis and accounted for 84% of all encounters. The most frequently documented age group was the 18-30 age category at 43%. CONCLUSION: although SCD comprised less than 2% of all ED visits, the majority of these visits could be classified as urgent visits based on resource utilization. This study adds to the emerging data on the burden of this disease in this St. Vincent and the Grenadines.
37055588	A Pharmacometrics Model to Characterize a New Type of Target-Mediated Drug Disposition (TMDD) - Nonlinear Pharmacokinetics of Small-Molecule PF-07059013 Mediated By Its High-capacity Pharmacological Target Hemoglobin With Positive Cooperative Binding.	In general, small-molecule target-mediated drug disposition (TMDD) is caused by the interaction of a drug with its high-affinity, low-capacity pharmacological target. In the current work, we developed a pharmacometrics model to characterize a new type of TMDD, where the nonlinear pharmacokinetics (PK) is mediated by a high-capacity pharmacological target with cooperative binding instead of target saturation. The model drug we used was PF-07059013, a noncovalent hemoglobin modulator that demonstrated promising preclinical efficacy to treat sickle cell disease (SCD), and showed complex nonlinear PK in mice with the fraction of unbound drug in blood (fub) decreased with an increase in PF-07059013 concentrations/doses due to the positive cooperative binding of PF-07059013 to hemoglobin. Among the various models we evaluated, the best one is a semi-mechanistic model where only drug molecules not bound to hemoglobin were allowed for elimination, with the nonlinear pharmacokinetics being captured by incorporating cooperative binding for drug molecules bound to hemoglobin. Our final model provided valuable insight on target binding-related parameters, such as the Hill coefficient gamma (estimated to be 1.6), binding constant KH (estimated to be 1450 microM), and the amount of total hemoglobin Rtot (estimated to be 2.13 micromol). As the dose selection of a compound with positive cooperative binding is tricky and challenging due to the nonproportional and steep response, our model may be valuable in facilitating the rational dose regimen selection for future preclinical animal and clinical trials for PF-07059013 and other compounds whose nonlinear pharmacokinetics are caused by similar mechanisms.
37248824	Pharmacogenetics of pain management in Zimbabwean patients with sickle cell disease.	Background: Pain is a common cause of hospitalization in sickle cell disease (SCD) patients. Failure to effectively control pain remains a challenge in patient care. Materials & methods: The authors conducted a cross-sectional study to determine the effect of CYP2D6 and UGT2B7 polymorphisms on pain management in 106 Zimbabwean SCD patients. Participant information was collected on a questionnaire. Genotyping was conducted using the GenoPharm  pharmacogenomics open array panel containing CYP2D6 and UGT genetic variants implicated in opioid response. Results: The reduced function alleles CYP2D6*17 and *29 had high frequencies of 15.9% and 12.9%, respectively. UGT2B7 rs73823859 showed a statistically significant correlation with pain levels (p = 0.0454). Conclusion: This study demonstrated the role of UGT2B7 polymorphism in SCD patient pain management.
33229918	HEMOGLOBIN C TRAIT PRESENTING WITH BILATERAL CENTRAL RETINAL VEIN OCCLUSION.	PURPOSE: To report a case of bilateral sequential, central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) in a man with newly diagnosed hemoglobin C trait. METHODS: A 67-year-old man presented with a one-month history of declining visual acuity. He was diagnosed with left CRVO. Bilateral temporal retinal ischemia and arteriovenous anastomoses on fluorescein angiography suggestive of sickle cell retinopathy prompted a systemic work-up. Hemoglobin electrophoresis revealed an underlying hemoglobin C trait. Six-months after his initial presentation, the patient developed symptomatic right CRVO. RESULTS: The initial left CRVO was complicated by optic disc swelling and macular edema. Intravitreal antiangiogenic therapy was initiated and the macular edema resolved. The left eye subsequently developed an epiretinal membrane which was surgically removed. Macular edema in the right eye also resolved after intravitreal antiangiogenic therapy. CONCLUSION: This is the first reported case of bilateral CRVO in a case of hemoglobin C trait. It is possible that erythrocyte inflexibility, caused by hemoglobin C-induced dehydration and crystallization, acted concomitantly with hypertension to produce occlusive microangiopathy. This case highlights the need for further investigation in patients presenting with central retinal vein occlusion, especially when bilateral, or when retinal angiography reveals bilateral pathology.
36308736	Role of regional anesthesia in patients with acute sickle cell pain: A scoping review.	Sickle cell disease is the most prevalent inherited blood disorder in the world, with significant morbidity and mortality. Patients often have recurrent painful vaso-occlusive episodes, and the American Society of Hematology gives a conditional recommendation for the use of regional anesthesia for acute sickle cell pain management. This scoping review summarizes the current evidence and identifies gaps for future research. Our screening process is outlined, and articles that mentioned the use of regional anesthesia for acute sickle cell crises were included. We present and interpret our results and highlight opportunities for future investigation.
32678452	Effect of Inhaled Cannabis for Pain in Adults With Sickle Cell Disease: A Randomized Clinical Trial.	Importance: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is characterized by chronic pain and episodic acute pain caused by vasoocclusive crises, often requiring high doses of opioids for prolonged periods. In humanized mouse models of SCD, a synthetic cannabinoid has been found to attenuate both chronic and acute hyperalgesia. The effect of cannabis on chronic pain in adults with SCD is unknown. Objective: To determine whether inhaled cannabis is more effective than inhaled placebo in relieving chronic pain in adults with SCD. Design, Setting, and Participants: This pilot randomized clinical trial included participants with SCD with chronic pain admitted to a single inpatient clinical research center for 2 separate 5-day stays from August 2014 to April 2017. Participants inhaled either vaporized cannabis (4.4% Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol to 4.9% cannabidiol) 3 times daily or vaporized placebo cannabis. Pain and pain interference ratings using the Brief Pain Inventory were assessed throughout each 5-day period. Participants with SCD and chronic pain on stable analgesics were eligible to enroll. A total of 90 participants were assessed for eligibility; 56 participants were deemed ineligible, and 34 participants were enrolled. Of these, 7 participants dropped out before randomization. Of 27 randomized participants, 23 completed both treatment arms of the crossover study and were included in the final per protocol analysis. Data analysis was completed in June 2019, with the sensitivity analysis conducted in April 2020. Interventions: Inhalation of vaporized cannabis plant (4.4% Delta-9-tetrahydrocannbinol to 4.9% cannabidiol) or placebo cannabis plant using a vaporizer 3 times daily for 5 days. Main Outcomes and Measures: Daily pain assessed with visual analog scale and Brief Pain Inventory. Results: A total of 23 participants (mean [SD] age, 37.6 [11.4] years; 13 [56%] women) completed the trial. The mean (SD) difference in pain rating assessment between the cannabis and placebo groups was -5.3 (8.1) for day 1, -10.9 (7.0) for day 2, -16.5 (9.2) for day 3, -8.9 (6.7) for day 4, and -8.2 (8.1) for day 5; however, none of these differences were statistically significant. There was no statistically significant mean (SD) difference in pain interference ratings between cannabis and placebo between days 1 and 5 for interference in general activities (day 1: 0.27 [0.35]; day 5: -1.0 [0.5]), walking (day 1: 0.14 [0.73]; day 5: -0.87 [0.63]), sleep (day 1: 0.59 [0.74]; day 5: -1.3 [0.8]), or enjoyment (day 1: 0.23 [0.69]; day 5: -0.91 [0.48]), but there was a statistically significant mean (SD) difference in decrease in interference with mood (day 1: 0.96 [0.59]; day 5: -1.4 [0.6]; P = .02). No differences in treatment-related adverse effects were observed. Use of concomitant opioids was similar during both treatment periods. Conclusions and Relevance: This randomized clinical trial found that, compared with vaporized placebo, vaporized cannabis did not statistically significantly reduce pain and associated symptoms, except interference in mood, in patients with SCD with chronic pain. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01771731.
36669729	Sickle Cell Trevor Thompson Transition Project (ST3P-UP) protocol for managing care transitions: Methods and rationale.	BACKGROUND: Emerging adults with sickle cell disease (EASCD) experience significant challenges transitioning from pediatric to adult care. Acute care utilization increases, quality of life (QOL) declines, with an increased risk of mortality. Currently, there are no practice standards to guide emerging adults through the transition process. We are creating a structured transition education (STE) based program for EASCD by customizing the Six Core Elements (6 CE) of Health Care Transition model and are evaluating the effectiveness of adding peer mentoring (PM). METHODS: The Sickle Cell Trevor Thompson Transition Project (ST3P-UP) is an ongoing multi-site, cluster randomized clinical trial with a target enrollment of 537 EASCD aged 16 to 25 years in pediatric care. Each site (n = 14) comprises a pediatric clinic, adult clinic, and a sickle cell disease (SCD) community-based organization (CBO). Sites are randomized 1:1 to either STE or STE + PM. EASCDs are followed prospectively for 24 months. Rapid cycle plan-do-study-act quality improvement (QI) methods are used to implement the STE. The primary objective is to compare the effectiveness of STE + PM versus STE only at decreasing the number of acute care visits per year over 24 months. The secondary objectives are to compare overall healthcare utilization and patient-reported QOL outcomes at 24 months. CONCLUSION: We aim to demonstrate the feasibility of using a QI approach to implement 6 CE-based practice standards at 14 disparate SCD clinical programs to guide EASCD through the transition process. We hypothesize that adding PM to the STE program will improve acute care reliance, QOL, and satisfaction with transition outcomes.
32618750	A Rare Case of Nontraumatic Thoracic Compression Fracture in a 28-Year-Old Man.	ABSTRACT: A 28-yr-old African American man with a history of synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis syndrome, tobacco use, and sickle cell trait was referred to a physiatrist at a multidisciplinary spine center with a 1-yr history of nontraumatic thoracic back pain that had significantly worsened over the previous 4 wks. In the context of recurrent infections requiring hospital admissions and the patient's immunosuppressed status, magnetic resonance imaging of his thoracic spine was obtained, showing an acute or subacute anterior compression deformity of the T7 vertebral body. He was subsequently provided with a hyperextension brace, physical therapy referral, and a trial of intranasal calcitonin. The patient reported significant improvement in pain at his 3-mo follow-up appointment and continued to show pain and functional improvement in physical therapy sessions up to 6 mos later.
32401216	Using Machine Learning to Predict Early Onset Acute Organ Failure in Critically Ill Intensive Care Unit Patients With Sickle Cell Disease: Retrospective Study.	BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder of the red blood cells, resulting in multiple acute and chronic complications, including pain episodes, stroke, and kidney disease. Patients with SCD develop chronic organ dysfunction, which may progress to organ failure during disease exacerbations. Early detection of acute physiological deterioration leading to organ failure is not always attainable. Machine learning techniques that allow for prediction of organ failure may enable early identification and treatment and potentially reduce mortality. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that machine learning physiomarkers can predict the development of organ dysfunction in a sample of adult patients with SCD admitted to intensive care units (ICUs). METHODS: We applied diverse machine learning methods, statistical methods, and data visualization techniques to develop classification models to distinguish SCD from controls. RESULTS: We studied 63 sequential SCD patients admitted to ICUs with 163 patient encounters (mean age 30.7 years, SD 9.8 years). A subset of these patient encounters, 22.7% (37/163), met the sequential organ failure assessment criteria. The other 126 SCD patient encounters served as controls. A set of signal processing features (such as fast Fourier transform, energy, and continuous wavelet transform) derived from heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate was identified to distinguish patients with SCD who developed acute physiological deterioration leading to organ failure from patients with SCD who did not meet the criteria. A multilayer perceptron model accurately predicted organ failure up to 6 hours before onset, with an average sensitivity and specificity of 96% and 98%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective study demonstrated the viability of using machine learning to predict acute organ failure among hospitalized adults with SCD. The discovery of salient physiomarkers through machine learning techniques has the potential to further accelerate the development and implementation of innovative care delivery protocols and strategies for medically vulnerable patients.
36215323	Monthly sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine-amodiaquine or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine as malaria chemoprevention in young Kenyan children with sickle cell anemia: A randomized controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: Children with sickle cell anemia (SCA) in areas of Africa with endemic malaria transmission are commonly prescribed malaria chemoprevention. Chemoprevention regimens vary between countries, and the comparative efficacy of prevention regimens is largely unknown. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We enrolled Kenyan children aged 1 to 10 years with homozygous hemoglobin S (HbSS) in a randomized, open-label trial conducted between January 23, 2018, and December 15, 2020, in Homa Bay, Kenya. Children were assigned 1:1:1 to daily Proguanil (the standard of care), monthly sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine-amodiaquine (SP-AQ), or monthly dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) and followed monthly for 12 months. The primary outcome was the cumulative incidence of clinical malaria at 12 months, and the main secondary outcome was the cumulative incidence of painful events by self-report. Secondary outcomes included other parasitologic, hematologic, and general events. Negative binomial models were used to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) per patient-year (PPY) at risk relative to Proguanil. The primary analytic population was the As-Treated population. A total of 246 children were randomized to daily Proguanil (n = 81), monthly SP-AQ (n = 83), or monthly DP (n = 82). Overall, 53.3% (n = 131) were boys and the mean age was 4.6 +- 2.5 years. The clinical malaria incidence was 0.04 episodes/PPY; relative to the daily Proguanil group, incidence rates were not significantly different in the monthly SP-AQ (IRR: 3.05, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.36 to 26.14; p = 0.39) and DP (IRR: 1.36, 95% CI: 0.21 to 8.85; p = 0.90) groups. Among secondary outcomes, relative to the daily Proguanil group, the incidence of painful events was not significantly different in the monthly SP-AQ and DP groups, while monthly DP was associated with a reduced rate of dactylitis (IRR: 0.47; 95% CI: 0.23 to 0.96; p = 0.038). The incidence of Plasmodium falciparum infection relative to daily Proguanil was similar in the monthly SP-AQ group (IRR 0.46; 95% CI: 0.17 to 1.20; p = 0.13) but reduced with monthly DP (IRR 0.21; 95% CI: 0.08 to 0.56; p = 0.002). Serious adverse events were common and distributed between groups, although compared to daily Proguanil (n = 2), more children died receiving monthly SP-AQ (n = 7; hazard ratio [HR] 5.44; 95% CI: 0.92 to 32.11; p = 0.064) but not DP (n = 1; HR 0.61; 95% CI 0.04 to 9.22; p = 0.89), although differences did not reach statistical significance for either SP-AQ or DP. Study limitations include the unexpectedly limited transmission of P. falciparum in the study setting, the high use of hydroxyurea, and the enhanced supportive care for trial participants, which may limit generalizability to higher-transmission settings where routine sickle cell care is more limited. CONCLUSIONS: In this study with limited malaria transmission, malaria chemoprevention in Kenyan children with SCA with monthly SP-AQ or DP did not reduce clinical malaria, but DP was associated with reduced dactylitis and P. falciparum parasitization. Pragmatic studies of chemoprevention in higher malaria transmission settings are warranted. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03178643). Pan-African Clinical Trials Registry: PACTR201707002371165.
37856098	Busulfan and subsequent malignancy: An evidence-based risk assessment.	BACKGROUND: The incidence of secondary malignancies associated with busulfan exposure is considered low, but has been poorly characterized. Because this alkylating agent is increasingly utilized as conditioning prior to gene therapy in nonmalignant hematologic and related disorders, more precise characterization of busulfan's potential contribution to subsequent malignant risk is warranted. PROCEDURE: We conducted a literature-based assessment of busulfan and subsequent late effects, with emphasis on secondary malignancies, identifying publications via PubMed searches, and selecting those reporting at least 3 years of follow-up. RESULTS: We identified eight pediatric and 13 adult publications describing long-term follow-up in 570 pediatric and 2076 adult hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients. Secondary malignancies were reported in 0.5% of pediatric HCT recipients, with no cases of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myelocytic leukemia (AML). Fatal secondary malignancies were reported in 0.8% of 1887 evaluable adult HCT recipients, and an overall incidence of secondary malignancies of 4.8% was reported in a subset of 389 evaluable adult patients. We also reviewed long-term results from eight publications evaluating lentiviral- and human promotor-based HSC-targeted gene therapy in 215 patients with nonmalignant conditions, in which busulfan/treosulfan monotherapy or busulfan/fludarabine was the only conditioning. Two malignancies were reported in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), one of which was potentially busulfan-related. No additional malignancies were reported in 173 patients with follow-up of 5-12 years. CONCLUSION: The incidence of busulfan-related secondary malignancies is low, and likely to be substantially less than 1% in pediatric transplant recipients, especially those receiving busulfan monotherapy for nonmalignant conditions other than SCD.
37060916	Alloimmunisation against red blood cells in sickle cell disease: transfusion challenges in high-income and low-income countries.	Sickle cell disease is the most frequent inherited disorder in sub-Saharan Africa and in many high-income countries (HICs). Transfusion is a key element of treatment, but it results in high rates of alloimmunisation against red blood cell antigens and post-transfusion haemolysis, which can be life-threatening in severe cases. The prevention of alloimmunisation is, therefore, an important issue in both HICs and in low-income countries (LICs). In HICs, the main reason for high alloimmunisation rates is blood group disparity between blood donors, who are mostly of European descent, and the patients, who are mostly of African descent. However, alloimmunisation rates also remain high in sub-Saharan Africa despite the homogeneity of blood group antigen frequencies between donors and patients; this occurrence is probably due to matching strategies limited to ABO blood group and RhD. However, other possible underlying causes of alloimmunisation have also been suggested, with each cause affecting HICs and LICs in different ways-eg, the immunogenetic and inflammatory status of the patient and the characteristics of the red blood cell products. In this Viewpoint, we discuss the available data and hypotheses that potentially account for the association of sickle cell disease with high rates of alloimmunisation in both settings, HICs and LICs (focusing particularly on sub-Saharan Africa), and the challenges faced by HICs and LICs to improve prevention of alloimmunisation.
33242447	The role of haematopoietic stem cell transplantation for sickle cell disease in the era of targeted disease-modifying therapies and gene editing.	Sickle cell disease is one of the most common, life-threatening, non-communicable diseases in the world and a major public health problem. Following the implementation of simple preventive and therapeutic modalities, infant mortality has almost been abolished in high-income countries, but only a small amount of progress has been made in improving survival in adulthood. Progressive end-organ damage, partly related to a systemic vasculopathy, is increasingly recognised. With the availability of a variety of novel disease-modifying drugs, gene addition and gene editing strategies, matched sibling donor haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in children (offering an overall survival rate of 95% and an event-free survival rate of 92%), and encouraging outcomes after alternative donor HSCT, the new challenge is to risk stratify patients, revise transplantation indications, and define the best therapeutic approach for each patient. The ultimate challenge will be to enable these advances in low-income and middle-income countries, where disease prevalence is highest and where innovative strategies are most needed.
36569951	Donor chimerism and immune reconstitution following haploidentical transplantation in sickle cell disease.	Introduction: We previously reported the initial results of a phase II multicenter transplant trial using haploidentical parental donors for children and aolescents with high-risk sickle cell disease achieving excellent survival with exceptionally low rates of graft-versus-host disease and resolution of sickle cell disease symptoms. To investigate human leukocyte antigen (HLA) sensitization, graft characteristics, donor chimerism, and immune reconstitution in these recipients. Methods: CD34 cells were enriched using the CliniMACS  system with a target dose of 10 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg with a peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMNC) addback dose of 2x105 CD3/kg in the final product. Pre-transplant HLA antibodies were characterized. Donor chimerism was monitored 1-24 months post-transplant. Comprehensive assessment of immune reconstitution included lymphocyte subsets, plasma cytokines, complement levels, anti-viral T-cell responses, activation markers, and cytokine production. Infections were monitored. Results: HLA antibodies were detected in 7 of 11 (64%) evaluable patients but rarely were against donor antigens. Myeloid engraftment was rapid (100%) at a median of 9 days. At 30 days, donor chimerism was 93-99% and natural killer cell levels were restored. By 60 days, CD19 B cells were normal. CD8 and CD4 T-cells levels were normal by 279 and 365 days, respectively. Activated CD4 and CD8 T-cells were elevated at 100-365 days post-transplant while naive cells remained below baseline. Tregs were elevated at 100-270 days post-transplant, returning to baseline levels at one year. At one year, C3 and C4 levels were above baseline and CH50 levels were near baseline. At one year, cytokine levels were not significantly different from baseline. Discussion: These results suggest that haploidentical transplantation with CD34-enriched cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cell addback results in rapid engraftment, sustained donor chimerism and broad-based immune reconstitution.
34047257	Gene Therapy as the New Frontier for Sickle Cell Disease.	Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is one of the most common monogenic disorders caused by a point mutation in the beta-globin gene. This mutation results in polymerization of hemoglobin (Hb) under reduced oxygenation conditions, causing rigid sickle-shaped RBCs and hemolytic anemia. This clearly defined fundamental molecular mechanism makes SCD a prototypical target for precision therapy. Both the mutant beta-globin protein and its downstream pathophysiology are pharmacological targets of intensive research. SCD also is a disease well-suited for biological interventions like gene therapy. Recent advances in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation and gene therapy platforms, like Lentiviral vectors and gene editing strategies, expand the potentially curative options for patients with SCD. This review discusses the recent advances in precision therapy for SCD and the preclinical and clinical advances in autologous HSC gene therapy for SCD.
36355034	Unique approaches for testicular shielding during total-body irradiation for pediatric patients.	Total-body irradiation (TBI) has been used as a part of the conditioning regimen for patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for certain nonmalignant conditions such as sickle cell disease. Although effective, TBI can cause lasting side effects for pediatric patients. One of these potential side effects includes oligospermia or even permanent azoospermia. Although many investigators have studied ways to shield the testicles during the TBI for nonmalignant conditions, there is no set standard. We describe the technical aspects of effective techniques to shield the testicles of male pediatric patients undergoing TBI. We verified that our techniques reduced the testicular dose by approximately 80%-85% of the TBI prescription dose in four male pediatric patients, keeping the dose well below the documented doses that can cause permanent infertility and hypogonadism.
35724043	Gestion des crises vaso-occlusives par les patients atteints de drepanocytose.	Introduction : Sickle cell disease, while it is the most common genetic disease in France, is little known to caregivers and the general public.Context : Only a few studies have examined the daily lives of people suffering from this disease.Objectives : The purpose of this project was to describe the specific strategies helping adult patients to manage the symptoms of their disease.Method : To reach this objective, a qualitative study was conducted among eight homozygous (SS) people over 30 years old living in the Ile-de-France region of France. The semi-structured interviews took place at the patients' homes, selected from several regional competence centers and on social media. An inductive methodology and a thematic analysis were used to draw the conclusions of this research.Results : They show that pain and suffering are patients' main complaints. Patients suffering from sickle cell disease seek numerous effective self-care strategies to manage their long-term pain : preventive measures and drugs, as well as complementary and alternative medicine.Discussion : A sociological approach shows us the considerable work that patients undertake to manage symptoms daily.Conclusion : The findings support interventions that would increase the feeling of control over the disease through better self-awareness and appropriate physical activity.

33216975	Improved stenosis outcome in stroke-free sickle cell anemia children after transplantation compared to chronic transfusion.	We report here the 3-year stenosis outcome in 60 stroke-free children with sickle cell anaemia (SCA) and an abnormal transcranial Doppler history, enrolled in the DREPAGREFFE trial, which compared stem cell transplantation (SCT) with standard-care (chronic transfusion for 1-year minimum). Twenty-eight patients with matched sibling donors were transplanted, while 32 remained on standard-care. Stenosis scores were calculated after performing cerebral/cervical 3D time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography. Fourteen patients had stenosis at enrollment, but only five SCT versus 10 standard-care patients still had stenosis at 3 years. Stenosis scores remained stable on standard-care, but significantly improved after SCT (P = 0 006). No patient developed stenosis after SCT, while two on standard-care did, indicating better stenosis prevention and improved outcome after SCT.
38000628	Gene-addition/editing therapy in sickle cell disease.	Gene therapy is an innovative strategy that offers potential cure for patients with sickle cell disease, and no appropriate donor for transplant consideration. While we await long term data from these clinical trials, we remain optimistic that gene therapy will become a standard of care for curative treatment in sickle cell disease. As gene therapy becomes a standard of treatment in sickle cell disease, we must also acknowledge the potential for financial burden to patients. We also must acknowledge the prevalence of sickle cell disease in low-resource settings. Hopefully, as we learn more about gene therapy, we can assess ways to overcome the financial toxicity that comes with this therapy.
32459595	Outcomes of a preoperative risk-based transfusion assignment protocol in sickle cell disease patients: a single-center retrospective study from Saudi Arabia.	Many patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) need surgical management during their lifetime. The best approach for preoperative transfusion in SCD is still to be determined. In this single-center retrospective study, we included HBSS/HBS-Beta0-thalassemia patients younger than 16 years of age who underwent surgery between January 2008 and July 2019. Preoperative transfusion assignment (PTA) was based on SCD severity and surgical risk. Patients were assigned to no transfusion, simple transfusion, or exchange transfusion. A total of 284 patients were identified and 66 (23%) underwent 78 procedures. Mean age at the time of procedure was 8 (5-11) years, mean baseline hemoglobin was 8.5 (7.8-9.3) g/dl, and mean hemoglobin F was 18.4 +- 8.2%. SCD severity was low-risk in 57 (73%) and high-risk in 21 (27%) patients. Surgical risk was low-risk in 20 (25.6%) and medium-risk in 58 (74.4%) procedures. PTA was no transfusion in 17 (22%), simple transfusion in 40 (51%), and exchange transfusion in 21 (27%) procedures. Postoperative complications occurred in five (6.4%) of procedures only in the simple transfusion group (three acute chest syndrome, one hemolytic anemia, one pain crisis) undergoing medium-risk surgery. Preoperative risk-based transfusion assignment is feasible. Despite a high baseline hemoglobin level in the no transfusion group, none of the patients developed postoperative complications. It is possible that the high baseline hemoglobin F phenotype was protective and indicates the need to study the risk/benefit of interventions used in this phenotype.
36583467	Individual-level behavioral interventions to support optimal development of children with sickle cell disease: A systematic review.	This review aimed to identify and describe individual-level behavioral interventions for children 0-18 years of age with sickle cell disease (SCD). PRISMA guidelines were followed at each stage of this review. Twenty-seven studies were included, representing six intervention types: disease knowledge (n = 7), self-management (n = 7), pain management (n = 4), school functioning (n = 4), cognitive health (n = 4), and mental health (n = 2). Most interventions targeted older children (5+ years), while only two examined interventions for children 0-3 years. This review suggests that offering education about disease knowledge, self-management, and pain management interventions can be beneficial for this population. Future research is needed to understand interventions to support young children and the impact of SCD on development.

35321643	Sex-specific genetic modifiers identified susceptibility of cold stored red blood cells to osmotic hemolysis.	BACKGROUND: Genetic variants have been found to influence red blood cell (RBC) susceptibility to hemolytic stress and affect transfusion outcomes and the severity of blood diseases. Males have a higher susceptibility to hemolysis than females, but little is known about the genetic mechanism contributing to the difference. RESULTS: To investigate the sex differences in RBC susceptibility to hemolysis, we conducted a sex-stratified genome-wide association study and a genome-wide gene-by-sex interaction scan in a multi-ethnic dataset with 12,231 blood donors who have in vitro osmotic hemolysis measurements during routine blood storage. The estimated SNP-based heritability for osmotic hemolysis was found to be significantly higher in males than in females (0.46 vs. 0.41). We identified SNPs associated with sex-specific susceptibility to osmotic hemolysis in five loci (SPTA1, KCNA6, SLC4A1, SUMO1P1, and PAX8) that impact RBC function and hemolysis. CONCLUSION: Our study established a best practice to identify sex-specific genetic modifiers for sexually dimorphic traits in datasets with mixed ancestries, providing evidence of different genetic regulations of RBC susceptibility to hemolysis between sexes. These and other variants may help explain observed sex differences in the severity of hemolytic diseases, such as sickle cell and malaria, as well as the viability of red cell storage and recovery.
31808907	A program of transition to adult care for sickle cell disease.	Most children with sickle cell disease (SCD) today survive into adulthood. Among emerging adults, there is a marked increase in acute care utilization and a rise in mortality, which can be exacerbated by not establishing or remaining in adult care. Health care transition programs are therefore essential to prepare, transfer, and integrate emerging adults in the adult care setting. The Six Core Elements of Health Care Transition, created by the Center for Health Care Transition Improvement, define the basic components of health care transition support as follows: (1) transition policy, (2) tracking and monitoring progress, (3) assessing transition readiness, (4) planning for adult care, (5) transferring to adult care, and (6) integrating into adult care. Programs that implement the Six Core Elements have experienced significant declines in care abandonment during adolescence and young adulthood and higher early adult care engagement. Most of the core transition activities are not currently reimbursable, however, posing a challenge to sustain transition programs. Ongoing studies are investigating interventions in comparative effectiveness trials to improve health-related quality of life and reduce acute care utilization among emerging adults with SCD. Although these studies will identify best practices for health care transition, it is also important to define how the transition outcomes will be measured, as no consensus definition exists for successful health care transition in SCD. Future research is needed to define best practices for health care transition, systematically assess transition outcomes, and revise payment models to promote sustainability of health care transition programs.
32470197	Non-myeloablative matched sibling stem cell transplantation with the optional reinforced stem cell infusion for patients with hemoglobinopathies.	BACKGROUND: The NIH protocol for non-myeloablative (NMA) conditioning allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) with alemtuzumab and low-dose total body irradiation corrected the abnormal sickle cell disease (SCD) phenotype without the risk of graft-versus-host disease. However, alloSCT using NMA conditioning had been rarely applied to beta-thalassemia major (beta-TM) patients. METHODS: To avoid prolonged immunosuppression, we developed a two-stage strategy. Mixed donor chimerism was initially achieved using the protocol developed by the NIH protocol. Thereafter, we facilitated donor chimerism using the optional reinforced stem cell (SC) infusion in cases requiring protracted immunosuppression or experiencing impending graft failure. RESULTS: In this study, beta-TM (n = 9) and SCD (n = 4) patients were equally effectively treated with eradicating the abnormal hemoglobin phenotype. Five patients, including four beta-TM, achieved stable mixed chimerism without receiving optional reinforced SC infusion. All patients that received optional reinforced infusion achieved complete (n = 4) or mixed chimerism (n = 1). The overall survival rate and event-free survival at 4 years were 91.7% (95% CI; 53.9-98.8) in both groups, with a thalassemia-free survival rate in beta-TM patients of 87.5% (95% CI; 38.7-98.1). CONCLUSION: This study is the first to report successful NMA conditioning alloSCT to achieve stable mixed chimerism correcting the abnormal hemoglobin phenotype in adult beta-TM patients.
32234293	Treatment of chronic venous insufficiency in Latin America.	OBJECTIVE: Venous disease is common in Latin America, with an estimated 68.11% prevalence of chronic venous disease. The diverse social, political, and economic characteristics of the many nations that make up Latin America mean that different conditions affect how these diseases are diagnosed and treated, which may differ markedly from the way they are treated by the health care systems of the United States and Europe. Our goal was to review the current state of treatment of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) in Latin America. METHODS: This is a narrative review of the medical literature on the subject and synthesizes sometimes fragmentary information on CVI across a large and diverse region. RESULTS: CVI represents an unmet medical need in Latin America. Conservative treatments, such as compression stockings, may be used at first, and there are nonpharmacologic and complementary and alternative medicine approaches in use. Endovenous approaches, such as endovenous thermal ablation, have largely replaced surgical interventions. In Europe and the United States, such procedures are mainly carried out in ambulatory facilities, whereas they are mainly performed in the hospital in Latin America. CONCLUSIONS: Recent strong economic growth in Latin America and improvements in social security and health care suggest that innovative approaches to chronic venous disease and CVI will be implemented.
37976218	Simultaneous Robotic-Assisted Splenectomy and Cholecystectomy in Children: Is It Safe and Effective?	Background: Hematologic conditions such as hereditary spherocytosis, sickle cell disease, and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura are frequently linked to cholelithiasis. In instances where symptoms are present, simultaneous cholecystectomy and splenectomy are commonly recommended. Our aim was to assess the outcomes of robotic-assisted procedures conducted for simultaneous surgical issues involving the spleen and gallbladder in pediatric patients. Materials and Methods: We have made a simultaneous retrospective study of children with hereditary hematological diseases who underwent combined robotic-assisted splenectomy and cholecystectomy at our institution from January 2010 to December 2021. Demographics, clinical features, intraoperative data, length of hospital stay, postoperative complications, and follow-up outcomes were analyzed. Results: A total of 11 patients (6 male; 5 female) were included, with a mean age of 13.9 +- 4.4 years (range 8-17). Hereditary spherocytosis was the most common disease (7 cases), followed by sick cell disease (4 cases), with associated symptomatic gallbladder litiasis in all of them. Both operations were carried out using the da Vinci  Surgical Si System in a single docking robotic platform (four robotic arms). Median total surgery time was 145 minutes (Q1-Q3: 115-162). Minimal intraoperative bleeding was recorded (mean 45 +- 15 mL), with no intraoperative complications or conversion. Median length of hospital stay was 3 days (Q1-Q3: 2-4). There were no cases of surgical wound infections or postoperative bleeding documented. Conclusion: Simultaneous robotic-assisted splenectomy and cholecystectomy can be considered safe and feasible interventions in children with hematological diseases that affect both the spleen and the gallbladder. However, further research is needed to enhance the existing evidence and establish a standardized approach.
38247082	The bold promise of gene therapy for sickle cell disease.	
35405024	DNA testing for sickle cell anemia in Africa: Implementation choices for the Democratic Republic of Congo.	BACKGROUND: Hemoglobin-based tests form the reference diagnostic test for SCA. In limited resource countries, these tests face limitations including cost, low sensitivity due to recurrent transfusions in endemic malaria region, and interference from fetal hemoglobin in neonatal diagnostic. This study aimed at adapting DNA-based SCA tests to limited resource countries and evaluating the economic benefit. METHODS: 338 participants were recruited in the Democratic Republic of Congo, sorted in 3 cohorts based on venous blood, umbilical cord blood (UCB) and buccal swab sampling. RFLP was performed to identify mutated allele. The feasibility and technical validity of this RFLP was evaluated for specimens collected on DBS cards and on EDTA tubes. RFLP on DBS stored at room temperature was regularly repeated to assess sample conservation. Finally, the cost analysis was performed. RESULTS: DBS cards yielded identical results to extracted DNA. Repeated testing returned the same result after four years. The DBS-based test performed on UCB or on buccal swab had a sensitivity and a precision of 100%. Cost comparison indicated that our approach costs half price of the widely used isoelectrofocussing of hemoglobin. CONCLUSION: The implemented DNA-based test approach overcomes the limitations faced by hemoglobin-based tests, while being more affordable. We propose to implement the RFLP test as a first line diagnostic test after transfusion and as second tiers for newborn screening. However, users should be aware that this test is unable to differentiate HbC from HbS or identify other point mutation of gene deletion of HBB gene.
38466269	Opioid Prescribing and Outcomes in Patients With Sickle Cell Disease Post-2016 CDC Guideline.	Importance: Although the intention of the 2016 US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain was not to limit pain treatment for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), clinicians and patients have recognized the possibility that the guideline may have altered outcomes for this population. However, the outcomes of the 2016 guideline for this patient population are unknown. Objective: To examine changes in opioid prescribing patterns and health outcomes among patients with SCD before and after the release of the 2016 CDC guideline. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study conducted interrupted time series analysis of claims data from the Merative MarketScan Commercial Database from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2019. In this population-based study in the US, individuals with SCD who were at least 1 year of age, had no cancer diagnosis, and had pharmacy coverage for the month of measurement were included. The data were analyzed from January 2021 to November 2023. Exposure: The CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain released in March 2016. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main variables measured in this study included the practice of opioid prescribing among patients with SCD (ie, rate of opioid prescriptions dispensed, mean number of days supplied, mean total morphine milligram equivalents [MME] per patient, and mean daily MME per opioid prescription) and pain-related health outcomes (rates of emergency department visits related to vaso-occlusive crises [VOC] and hospitalizations related to VOC). Results: The cohort included 14 979 patients with SCD (mean [SD] age, 25.9 [16.9] years; 8520 [56.9%] female). Compared with the preguideline trends, the following changes were observed after the guideline was released: significant decreases in the coefficient for change in slope of the opioid dispensing rate (-0.29 [95% CI, -0.39 to -0.20] prescriptions per 100 person-month; P < .001), the number of days supplied per prescription (-0.05 [95% CI, -0.06 to -0.04] days per prescription-month; P < .001), and opioid dosage (-141.0 [95% CI, -219.5 to -62.5] MME per person-month; P = .001; -10.1 [95% CI, -14.6 to -5.6] MME/prescription-month; P < .001). Conversely, a significant increase in VOC-related hospitalizations occurred after the guideline release (0.16 [95% CI, 0.07-0.25] hospitalizations per 100 person-month; P = .001). These changes were observed to a greater extent among adult patients, but pediatric patients experienced similar changes in several measures, even though the guideline focused exclusively on adult patients. Conclusions and Relevance: This retrospective cohort study showed that the 2016 CDC guideline may have had unintended negative outcomes on the patient population living with SCD.
38069526	Euvolemic automated transfusion to treat severe anemia in sickle cell disease patients at risk of circulatory overload.	BACKGROUND: Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion remains a major treatment for sickle cell disease (SCD). Patients with SCD have a high prevalence of renal impairment and cardiorespiratory disease, conferring risk of transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We describe an approach, titled euvolemic automated transfusion (EAT), to transfuse SCD patients with severe anemia who are at risk of TACO. In EAT, plasmapheresis is performed using donor RBCs, rather than albumin or plasma, as replacement fluid. Euvolemia is maintained. A retrospective analysis was conducted of patients with SCD who underwent EAT at our institution over a 10-year period, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of EAT. RESULTS: Eleven SCD patients underwent 109 EAT procedures (1-59 procedures per patient). The median age was 42 years (IQR = [30-49]) and 82% (n = 9) were female. Most (82%; n = 9) patients had severe chronic kidney disease and 55% (n = 6) had heart failure. One (9%) patient had a history of life-threatening TACO. Mean pre- and post-procedure Hct values were 19.8% (SD +- 1.6%) and 29.1% (SD +- 1.4%), respectively. The average Hct increment was 3.2% per RBC unit. Only two EAT-related complications were recorded during the 109 procedures: central line-associated infection and citrate toxicity (muscle cramping). EAT used an average of two RBC units less than that projected for standard automated RBC exchange. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that EAT is safe and effective to treat patients with SCD and severe anemia, who are at risk for TACO. EAT requires fewer RBC units compared to automated RBC exchange.
32450825	The burden and outcomes of stroke in young adults at a tertiary hospital in Tanzania: a comparison with older adults.	BACKGROUND: Stroke burden in young adults is growing associated with unique risk factors and devastating outcomes. We aimed to investigate the magnitude, risk factors and outcomes of first ever stroke in young adults <=45 years compared to older adults > 45 years. METHODS: All patients with a World Health Organization clinical definition of stroke at a tertiary hospital in Tanzania were enrolled. The National Institute of Health Stroke Scale and Modified Rankin Scale were used to assess admission stroke severity and outcomes respectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to describe survival and Cox-proportional hazards model was used to examine predictors of fatality. RESULTS: We enrolled 369 first ever stroke participants over 8 months. First strokes accounted for one quarter of the medical admissions in both younger and older groups, 123/484 {(25.4%) [95% CI 21.5-29.3%]} and 246/919 {(26.8%) [95% CI 23.9-29.6%]} respectively. Hemorrhagic stroke occurred in 47 (42.3%) vs 62 (27.2%) for the young and old respectively p = 0.005. Factors associated with stroke in the young were: a new diagnosis of hypertension in 33 (26.8%) vs 23 (9.3%) p < 0.001, HIV infection 12 (9.8%) vs 7 (2.8%) p = 0.005, use of hormonal contraception in females 33 (48.5%) vs 13 (9.4%) p < 0.001, elevated serum low density lipoproteins 28 (27.7%) vs 29 (16.4%) p = 0.024, hypercholesteremia 34 (31.2%) vs 40 (20.2%), p = 0.031, sickle cell disease 11 (9.7%) vs 9 (4.2%) p = 0.047 and thrombocytosis 12 (16.9%) vs 8 (5.6%) p = 0.007. The overall 30-day fatality rate was 215 (61.3%); 57 (49.1%) vs 158 (67.2%) in the young and old respectively. Independent predictors of fatality were: severe stroke {HR 10.35 (95% CI: 1.397-76.613)}, leukocytosis {HR 2.23 (95% CI: 1.448-3.419)} and fever {HR 1.79 (95% CI: 1.150-2.776)}. CONCLUSIONS: There is a high burden of stroke in young adults that is coupled with a high 30-day fatality rate. Screening and management of hypertension is crucial in the prevention of stroke. More research is needed to identify factors which cause death, allowing the development of sustainable interventions to reduce early post stroke fatality in this group.
36354234	Safety of coronavirus disease 2019 vaccines in 213 adult patients with sickle cell disease.	Given the lack of information about safety of the COVID-19 vaccines for sickle cell disease (SCD) patients, we sought to determine whether COVID-19 vaccine was associated with subsequent hospital admission for vaso-occlusive events (VOEs). We included 402 patients with SCD, including 88 regularly transfused. As of July 31, 2021, 213 (53.0%) of them had received a least one dose of COVID vaccine (Pfizer 93.0%). We showed similar risk of hospital admission for a VOE among vaccinated patients (whether transfused or not) and among a control group of non-vaccinated patients matched for age, sex and genotype.
31785949	Transfusion Medicine Equations Made Internet Accessible.	Multiple mathematical equations inform the practice of transfusion medicine. These equations apply to a wide range of topics: dosage of blood products, calculation of fluid volumes, and even specific treatment decisions (e.g. corrected count increment for determination of platelet refractoriness). The calculation of these equations can be complicated, prone to error, and time-consuming. A trusted source is needed to accurately perform these calculations 24 hours a day without error and without monetary cost. We sought to build internet-enabled calculators relevant to the practice of transfusion medicine. We partnered with MDCalc, an online host of medical calculators with 1 million monthly users in 196 countries, to design and host the calculators. The calculators guide users in the application of transfusion medicine equations by providing indications for use, inputs for the equations variables, error-checking, warnings for bad inputs, and interpretive guidance of the result. The following calculators were built: blood volume, corrected count increment (CCI), plasma dosage, cryoprecipitated antihemophilic factor dosage, approximate number of units for compatibility testing, maternal-fetal hemorrhage Rh(D) immune globulin dosage, intrauterine RBC transfusion dosage, neonatal polycythemia partial exchange, theoretical removal of a substance by plasmapheresis, sickle cell RBC exchange volume, peripheral blood stem cell collection, and a calculator relevant to donor lymphocyte infusion. Clinicians can now utilize this reputable and highly visible online source to access these common transfusion medicine equations at any time with an internet-enabled device (https://www.mdcalc.com/search?filter=transfusion+medicine).
38066846	Logistics, risks, and benefits of automated red blood cell exchange for patients with sickle cell disease.	Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions treat and prevent severe complications of sickle cell disease (SCD) and can be delivered as a simple or exchange transfusion. During an exchange, some of the patient's abnormal hemoglobin (Hb) S (HbS) RBCs are removed. An apheresis device can accomplish an automated RBC exchange, simultaneously removing patient's RBCs while returning other blood components along with normal RBCs. Automated RBC exchange is therefore an isovolemic transfusion that can efficiently decrease HbS RBCs while limiting iron loading and hyperviscosity. However, specialized equipment, trained personnel, appropriate vascular access, and increased RBC exposure are required compared to simple or manual RBC exchange. Therefore, risks and benefits must be balanced to make individualized decisions for patients with SCD who require transfusion.
33296531	Matched sibling donor stem cell transplantation for sickle cell disease: Results from the Spanish group for bone marrow transplantation in children.	OBJECTIVES: The prevalence of sickle cell disease (SCD) in Spain is markedly inferior compared with other European and Mediterranean countries. However, the diagnosis of new patients with SCD is expected to increase. In this multicenter retrospective study, we analyze the hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) results obtained in Spain. METHODS: Forty-five patients who underwent a matched sibling donor (MSD) HSCT between 1999 and 2018 were included. Primary endpoint was event-free survival (EFS), and secondary endpoints included acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Bone marrow was the most frequent stem cell source (93.3%). Most patients received a conditioning regimen based on busulfan and cyclophosphamide (69%). Cumulative incidence of grade III-IV acute GvHD and chronic GvHD was 6.8% (95% CI: 2.3%-20.1%) and 5.4% (95% CI: 1.38%-19.9%), respectively. EFS and overall survival (OS) at 3 years post-HSCT were 89.4% (95% CI: 73.9%-95.9%) and 92.1% (95% CI: 77.2%-97.4%), respectively. All patients aged <= 5 presented 100% EFS and OS. CONCLUSIONS: An early referral to HSCT centers should be proposed early in life, before severe complications occur. MSD HSCT should be considered a curative option for all patients aged <= 5 years and for older pediatric patients who present complications derived from the disease.
32604335	Potential Risk Factors Associated With Graft Failure of Haploidentical Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation in Children With Sickle Cell Disease.	Nonmyeloablative (NMA) haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for sickle cell disease has significantly increased donor availability for transplant and is increasingly used as curative treatment. The authors describe 3 pediatric patients who rejected grafts after an NMA regimen, previously reported to result in good engraftment rates in the mainly adult population. In this manuscript, potential factors contributing to rejection are described and discussed. The authors emphasize the need to further optimize the NMA regimens in pediatric patients and perform haploidentical transplants for sickle cell disease on clinical trials.
