38103934		The promise of genetic therapies in sickle cell disease.
37956414		Digital PCR to Measure SARS-CoV-2 RNA, Variants, and Outcomes in Youth.BACKGROUND: The role of SARS-CoV-2 viral load in predicting contagiousness, disease severity, transmissibility, and clinical decision-making continues to be an area of great interest. However, most studies have been in adults and have evaluated SARS-CoV-2 loads using cycle thresholds (Ct) values, which are not standardized preventing consistent interpretation critical to understanding clinical impact and utility. Here, a quantitative SARS-CoV-2 reverse-transcription digital PCR (RT-dPCR) assay normalized to WHO International Units was applied to children at risk of severe disease diagnosed with COVID-19 at St Jude Children's Research Hospital between March 28, 2020, and January 31, 2022. METHODS: Demographic and clinical information from children, adolescents and young adults treated at St Jude Children's Research Hospital were abstracted from medical records. Respiratory samples underwent SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantitation by RT-dPCR targeting N1 and N2 genes, with sequencing to determine the genetic lineage of infecting virus. RESULTS: Four hundred and sixty-two patients aged 0-24 years (median 11 years old) were included during the study period. Most patients were infected by the omicron variant (43.72%), followed by ancestral strain (22.29%), delta (13.20%) and alpha (2.16%). Viral load at presentation ranged from 2.49 to 9.14 log10 IU/ml, and higher viral RNA loads were associated with symptoms (OR 1.32: CI95% 1.16-1.49) and respiratory disease (OR 1.23: CI95% 1.07-1.41). Viral load did not differ by SARS-CoV-2 variant, vaccination status, age, or baseline diagnosis. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 RNA loads predict the presence of symptomatic and respiratory diseases. The use of standardized, quantitative methods is feasible, allows for replication, comparisons across institutions, and has the potential to facilitate consensus quantitative thresholds for risk stratification and treatment.
37939877		Sickle cell disease and pregnancy.Pregnancy is a particularly risky period in the life of patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Physiological changes during pregnancy increase the risk of vaso-occlusive crises (VOC), acute chest syndrome, venous thromboembolic events, and infections. This concerns haemoglobin (Hb) S/C and S/beta+-thalassaemia patients as much than S/S or S/beta0-thalassaemia patients. SCD also increases the risk of obstetrical complications, such as preeclampsia, in utero foetal death, preterm delivery mostly induced, and intrauterine growth restriction. Thus, pregnancy should be planned and closely monitored by a multidisciplinary team involving obstetricians and sickle cell disease specialists. Before pregnancy, the parents should also be informed about the risk of transmission of this autosomal recessive disease, and the father should therefore be prescribed haemoglobin electrophoresis. Treatments have to be revised when planning pregnancy: hydroxyurea (HU) should be stopped as soon as pregnancy is suspected or confirmed. Preventive blood transfusion is not systematic, but is recommended in the case of a pre-existing transfusion program prior to pregnancy, severe pre-existing organ damage, severe obstetric history, and severe or repeated crises during follow-up, especially in patients taking HU before. Despite the risks of prematurity, systematic administration of corticosteroids for foetal lung maturation is not recommended due to the risk of maternal vaso-occlusive event. Although more frequent, due to obstetrical and maternal complications, caesarean section is not systematic, in the absence of maternal contraindications. It is advisable not to exceed the term of 39 weeks of amenorrhoea. Post-partum follow-up is recommended, particularly because of the risk of thromboembolism.
37967611	treat|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Hypertension_Pulmonary	Pulmonary Hypertension in Sickle Cell Disease.Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a complex genetic disorder that has long challenged both patients and healthcare professionals. One of its chronic and debilitating complications is pulmonary hypertension (PH). SCD-associated PH is often post-capillary, secondary to left heart disease. It can also sometimes be pre-capillary with multiple and often interrelated mechanisms including obstructive remodeling of the pulmonary vascular bed secondary to hemolysis, endothelial dysfunction, thrombosis, hypoxia, or associated risk factors like portal hypertension. Screening symptomatic patients with echocardiographic signs of PH is crucial to determine those who should undergo right heart catheterization, the cornerstone exam to diagnose and categorize patients with PH. The workup following the diagnosis relies on identifying the cause of PH to personalize treatment. Ongoing efforts are made to treat this complex condition, starting with treating the underlying disease with hydroxyurea or chronic blood exchange transfusion. Robust data on the efficacy of PAH-specific therapies are lacking in this specific population. Initiation of such therapies must be made by an expert center after a case-by-case assessment of the benefit-risk ratio according to the phenotype and the mechanisms involved in the development of PH. Efforts are also poured into studying the interventional and medical therapies used on chronic thromboembolic PH for patients presenting with a thrombotic form. The management of those patients requires a multidisciplinary approach, with conjoint efforts from PH and SCD specialists.
38066873		Alloimmunization and hyperhemolysis in sickle cell disease.Alloimmunization against red blood cell antigens and delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction (DHTR) are major barriers to transfusion in sickle cell disease (SCD). In SCD, DHTR is a potentially life-threatening. Blood group polymorphism in SCD patients, who are of African ancestry and frequently exposed to antigens they do not carry; an inflammatory clinical state; and occasional transfusion in acute situations are risk factors for alloimmunization and DHTR. In patients at risk, the transfusion indication must be balanced against the risk of developing DHTR. However, when transfusion is absolutely necessary, protocols combining the prevention of exposure to immunogenic antigens with immunosuppressive treatments must be implemented, and patients should be carefully monitored during posttransfusion follow-up. This close monitoring makes it possible to diagnose hyperhemolysis as soon as possible; to avoid retransfusion, which can exacerbate hemolysis; and to administer specific treatments, such as anticomplement therapy, in severe cases. Finally, in patients with severe disease, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation may be indicated. However, transfusion is also required in this context, and its management is complex because these risks must be taken into account.
38190311		An Updated Equitable Model of Readiness for Transition to Adult Care: Content Validation in Young People With Sickle Cell Disease.IMPORTANCE: Despite elevated health risks during young adulthood, many adolescents and young adults with serious health care needs face barriers during the transfer to an adult specialty practitioner, and health disparities may occur during the transition. OBJECTIVE: To validate the content of an updated Social-Ecological Model of Adolescent and Young Adult Readiness for Transition to Promote Health Equity (SMART-E) in a group of adolescents and young adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) and their supports. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Health equity framework components were reviewed. Systems of power (eg, institutional and practitioner bias) and environments or networks (eg, peer or school support) were added as SMART-E preexisting factors, and health literacy was included within readiness factors. Adolescents and young adults aged 16 to 29 years with SCD, caregivers, and practitioners participated in this convergent, mixed-methods study within Children's Hospital of Philadelphia between January and August 2022. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Content validity was assessed through nominations of top 3 most important transition barriers prior to interviews and focus groups, ratings on importance of SMART-E factors (0-4 scale; ratings >2 support validity) after interviews and focus groups, nominations of 3 most important factors for transition and for health equity, and qualitative content analysis of interview transcripts. RESULTS: The study enrolled 10 pediatric adolescents and young adults (mean [SD] age, 18.6 [2.9] years; 4 female and 6 male), 10 transferred adolescents and young adults (mean [SD] age, 22.9 [2.1] years; 8 female and 2 male), 9 caregivers (mean [SD] age, 49.8 [8.7] years; 5 female and 4 male), and 9 practitioners (mean [SD] age, 45.6 [10.5] years; 8 female and 1 male). Quantitative ratings supported the content validity of SMART-E and met established criteria for validity. Systems of power was the most endorsed transition barrier (14 of 38 participants) reported prior to interviews and focus groups. After the interview, participants endorsed all SMART-E factors as important for transition, with new factors systems of power and environments and networks rated at a mean (SD) 2.8 (1.23) and 3.1 (0.90), respectively, on a 0 to 4 scale of importance. The most important factors for transition and equity varied by participant group, with all factors being endorsed, supporting the comprehensiveness of SMART-E. Qualitative data corroborated quantitative findings, further supporting validity, and minor modifications were made to definitions. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: SMART-E obtained initial content validation with inclusion of health equity factors for adolescents and young adults with SCD, caregivers, and practitioners. The model should be evaluated in other populations of adolescents and young adults with chronic disease.
37858508	treat|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell	The evolving treatment landscape for children with sickle cell disease.Sickle cell disease is the most common inherited pathological haemoglobinopathy. Over the past 30 years, disease-related morbidity and mortality have improved in high-income countries due to advances in preventive care and treatments. Established disease-modifying therapies, such as hydroxyurea (hydrocarbamide), are continuing to have an important role in the treatment of sickle cell disease, and newer agents also show promise. In the past 5 years, the US Food and Drug Administration approved three additional sickle cell disease-modifying medications, and new gene therapies have been developed as an alternative curative treatment to haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. In this Review, we discuss the current treatment landscape for paediatric sickle cell disease and emerging innovations in care. We also review the need for close, long-term management for children receiving newer therapies and the importance of ongoing investment in people with sickle cell disease in low-income and middle-income countries.
38037041		Opioid prescriptions among the World Trade Center Health Program population.BACKGROUND: The World Trade Center Health Program (Program) provides limited health care to those directly affected by the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Because of physical/mental trauma arising from the 9/11 attacks, Program members might be at high risk of opioid use. To prevent prescription opioid overuse, in 2018 the Program implemented various measures to improve opioid prescribing and expand access to non-opioid pain management among Program members. However, the characteristics of opioid prescriptions dispensed among this population has never been described. METHODS: Administrative and claims data from 07/01/2011 to 09/30/2022 were used to describe opioid prescriptions dispensed during 2013-2021. RESULTS: From 2013-2021, 108,285 members were Program-enrolled for >= 10 months, 4,053 (3.7%) had 22,938 outpatient opioid prescriptions, of which, 62.1% were for cancer-related pain, 11.1% for hospice/end of life care, 4.8% for surgery pain, and 9.8% for acute/chronic pain. Among members with Program-paid diagnostic/treatment claims (n = 70,721), the proportion with opioid prescriptions for cancer/hospice/end of life care increased from 0.5% in 2013 to 1.6% in 2018 (p = 0.010), then decreased to 1.1% in 2021 (p = 0.070), and the proportion for non-cancer surgery/acute/chronic pain decreased from 0.6% in 2013 to 0.23% in 2021 (p = 0.0005). Among members prescribed opioids without cancer/hospice/sickle cell disease, the proportion who started with long-acting opioids or had opioid prescriptions from >= 4 prescribers were below 6.5% annually; the proportion receiving a high-dose (>= 90 morphine milligram equivalents per day [MED]), or with concurrent opioids and benzodiazepines use, or who started opioids with MED >= 50 or with long duration (>= 7 days' supply) were above 10% annually, but decreased since 2017. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of outpatient opioid prescriptions paid by the Program was very low and prescriptions were primarily dispensed for cancer/hospice/end of life care. Although Program efforts to improve opioid prescribing coincided with improvements in outcomes, ongoing surveillance is needed.
38224366		Enhancing diagnostic precision for acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease: insights from dual-energy CT lung perfusion mapping.PURPOSE: Acute chest syndrome (ACS) is secondary to occlusion of the pulmonary vasculature and a potentially life-threatening complication of sickle cell disease (SCD). Dual-energy CT (DECT) iodine perfusion map reconstructions can provide a method to visualize and quantify the extent of pulmonary microthrombi. METHODS: A total of 102 patients with sickle cell disease who underwent DECT CTPA with perfusion were retrospectively identified. The presence or absence of airspace opacities, segmental perfusion defects, and acute or chronic pulmonary emboli was noted. The number of segmental perfusion defects between patients with and without acute chest syndrome was compared. Sub-analyses were performed to investigate robustness. RESULTS: Of the 102 patients, 68 were clinically determined to not have ACS and 34 were determined to have ACS by clinical criteria. Of the patients with ACS, 82.4% were found to have perfusion defects with a median of 2 perfusion defects per patient. The presence of any or new perfusion defects was significantly associated with the diagnosis of ACS (P = 0.005 and < 0.001, respectively). Excluding patients with pulmonary embolism, 79% of patients with ACS had old or new perfusion defects, and the specificity for new perfusion defects was 87%, higher than consolidation/ground glass opacities (80%). CONCLUSION: DECT iodine map has the capability to depict microthrombi as perfusion defects. The presence of segmental perfusion defects on dual-energy CT maps was found to be associated with ACS with potential for improved specificity and reclassification.
38302120		Comprehensive Care in Sickle Cell Disease.Despite advancements in sickle cell disease (SCD) management, individuals with SCD continue to face greater degrees of mortality, disability, and health care barriers compared with their healthy peers. Comprehensive care includes essential elements such as newborn screening, key immunizations, penicillin prophylaxis, and consistent health screening for common complications. Pediatricians should be familiar with treatment options for SCD to offer informed education to both patients and their families. By providing guided and comprehensive care, pediatricians have the potential to enhance both the quantity and quality of life for individuals living with SCD. [Pediatr Ann. 2024;53(2):e43-e46.].
37948742		ATYPICAL FOVEAL AND PARFOVEAL ABNORMALITIES IN SICKLE CELL DISEASE.PURPOSE: The primary aim was to describe patterns of para macular involvement, not yet reported but that OCT-A can now detect in SCD patients. The secondary aim was to search arguments concerning the physio pathogeny of para macular involvement. METHODS: This institutional cohort retrospective study was conducted in a Referral Center for Ophthalmological Rare Diseases. Follow-up included an ophthalmological examination with optical coherent tomography and optical coherent tomography angiography. RESULTS: Hundred and thirty-two sickle cell patients were included. Typical sickle cell maculopathy was observed in temporal area in 84 eyes (40.0 %) of SS patients and 8 eyes (14.8 %) of SC patients (p < 0.001). Enlargement of the foveal avascular zone was observed in 10 eyes whom 8 of SS patients. Two atypical parafoveal abnormalities were found in SS patients only. The first one consisted in macular thinning with normal vascularization in 15 eyes of 11 patients. The second atypical maculopathy was large areas of loss of vascularization without retina thinning 10 eyes of six patients. Multivariate analysis did not show a statistically significant relation between the PSR stage and the different type of sickle cell maculopathy (p = 0.21). CONCLUSION: Those atypical sickle cell maculopathy may correspond to early forms preceding a typical SCM. This would point towards several physiopathogenic mechanisms. The first one included the existence of ischemia which can be related to anemia. Presence of retinal thinning without vascular involvement point out to a neurogenic mechanism.
38302121		Disease-Modifying Therapies for Sickle Cell Disease-An Overview.Sickle cell disease refers to a group of inherited blood disorders in which hemoglobin polymerization leads to hemolysis and vaso-occlusion. This causes a myriad of complications during a patient's life span, ranging from anemia, infections, and acute and chronic pain to stroke and multiorgan dysfunction. Although there have been dramatic improvements in childhood survival thanks to improved supportive care with penicillin prophylaxis, immunizations, and improved transfusion practices, there was a dearth of disease-modifying therapies, with hydroxyurea being the only medication for >20 years. Here, we discuss the newer therapies for sickle cell disease that have emerged in recent years. [Pediatr Ann. 2024;53(2):e52-e55.].

37939905	cotreat|@CHEMICAL_Buprenorphine|@CHEMICAL_Naloxone ;treat|@CHEMICAL_Naloxone|@DISEASE_Opioid_Related_Disorders ;treat|@CHEMICAL_Buprenorphine|@DISEASE_Opioid_Related_Disorders	Evaluation of opioid use disorder treatment outcomes in patients receiving split daily versus once daily dosing of buprenorphine-naloxone.INTRODUCTION: In clinical practice, sublingual (SL) buprenorphine-naloxone is prescribed as once daily or split daily dosing for the management of opioid use disorder (OUD). Evidence is lacking that assesses how split daily buprenorphine-naloxone affects OUD outcomes. This study aims to evaluate how the dosing frequency of SL buprenorphine-naloxone impacts therapy effectiveness when treating patients with OUD. METHODS: This retrospective analysis included adult outpatients prescribed treatment with SL buprenorphine-naloxone for OUD between July 1, 2016, and March 1, 2020. The study excluded patients with sickle cell disease, recent methadone treatment, or pregnancy. We characterized study groups by dosing frequency, either once daily or split dosing. The study compared retention in treatment, medication adherence, adherence to treatment program, and hospital encounters between groups. RESULTS: The study screened eight-hundred and seven patients, and included 250 patients newly prescribed SL buprenorphine-naloxone. Fifty-seven patients (22.8 %) were prescribed once daily dosing and 193 patients (77.2 %) were prescribed split daily dosing. The study found no significant differences noted in 12-month rates of treatment retention (52.6 % vs. 45.6 %, p = .35). These outcomes remained similar when assessed at three and six months. Within a year of buprenorphine-naloxone initiation, the study found no differences in the percentage of patients with hospitalizations (26.3 % vs. 38.3 %, p = .10), median number of hospitalizations (2 vs. 2), or proportion of days covered by a prescription >=80 % (93.3 % vs. 92.0 %, p = .82). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, patients receiving once daily buprenorphine-naloxone had similar treatment outcomes to patients receiving split dosing. Further controlled studies are necessary to evaluate which patients are more likely to benefit from split dosing.
38308541		Adverse pregnancy, fetal and neonatal outcomes in women with sickle cell disease in a Middle Eastern country.BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease in pregnancy is associated with high maternal and fetal mortality. However, studies reporting pregnancy, fetal, and neonatal outcomes in women with sickle cell disease are extremely limited. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of the study are to determine whether women with sickle cell disease have a greater risk of adverse pregnancy, fetal, and neonatal outcomes than women without sickle cell disease and identify the predictors of adverse pregnancy, fetal, and neonatal outcomes in women with sickle cell disease. DESIGN: A retrospective pair-matched case-control study was conducted to compare 171 pregnant women with sickle cell disease to 171 pregnant women without sickle cell disease in Muscat, Sultanate of Oman. METHODS: All pregnant Omani women with sickle cell disease who delivered between January 2015 and August 2021 at Sultan Qaboos University Hospital and Royal Hospital, who were either primipara or multipara and who had a gestational age of 24-42 weeks, were included as patients, whereas women who had no sickle cell disease or any comorbidity during pregnancy, who delivered within the same timeframe and at the same hospitals, were recruited as controls. The data were retrieved from electronic medical records and delivery registry books between January 2015 and August 2021. RESULTS: Women with sickle cell disease who had severe anemia had increased odds of (chi2 = 58.56, p < 0.001) having adverse pregnancy outcomes. Women with sickle cell disease had 21.97% higher odds of delivering a baby with intrauterine growth retardation (chi2 = 17.80, unadjusted odds ratio = 2.91-166.13, p < 0.001). Newborns born to women with sickle cell disease had 3.93% greater odds of being admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (chi2 = 16.80, unadjusted odds ratio = 1.97-7.84, p < 0.001). In addition, the children born to women with sickle cell disease had 10.90% higher odds of being born with low birth weight (chi2 = 56.92, unadjusted odds ratio = 5.36-22.16, p < 0.001). Hemoglobin level (odds ratio = 0.17, p < 0.001, 95% confidence interval = 0.10-3.0), past medical history (odds ratio = 7.95, p < 0.001, 95% confidence interval = 2.39-26.43), past surgical history (odds ratio = 17.69, p < 0.001, 95% confidence interval = 3.41-91.76), and preterm delivery (odds ratio = 9.48, p = 0.005, 95% confidence interval = 1.95-46.23) were identified as predictors of adverse pregnancy, fetal, and neonatal outcomes in women with sickle cell disease. CONCLUSION: As pregnant women with sickle cell disease are at increased risk for pregnancy, fetal, and neonatal adverse outcomes; improved antenatal surveillance and management may improve the outcomes.
37982216		Silent Cerebral Infarcts in Iraqi Patients with Sickle Cell Disease.Silent ischemic infarcts have been reported to be the most frequent neurological abnormalities in sickle cell disease (SCD) in several studies worldwide. However, no previous studies investigated this neurological disorder in Iraqi SCD patients. To address this issue, a total of 52 patients with a median age of 20 years (range 10-46) and including 46.2% males were enrolled. Patients were clinically evaluated and their records were reviewed. They had full blood and reticulocyte counts, hemoglobin F estimation, serum lactic dehydrogenase and bilirubin assayed, as well as brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to screen for silent cerebral infarcts. Six out of the 52 patients (11.5%) had silent cerebral infarcts, all of which were in the deep white matter, ranging from 6 to 10 mm in their largest diameters. There were no significant differences in age, sex, or sickle cell genotype between those with silent cerebral infarcts and those without it. Those with silent cerebral infarcts had lower median hemoglobin, higher reticulocytes and lower pain frequencies than those without it, yet again this was not significant. Follow up MRI in four out of the six silent infarct patients showed no additional lesions and no increase in size of the original ones after six to eight months. In conclusion, it appears that the frequency of silent cerebral infarcts in Iraqi SCD patients is lower than the bulk of the literature from other populations. Further studies to screen for genetic polymorphisms that may explain this lower rate may be informative.
38331925		Role of hydroxyurea therapy in the prevention of organ damage in sickle cell disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.BACKGROUND: Hydroxyurea is an affordable drug that reduces vaso-occlusive crises and transfusion requirements in sickle cell disease. However, its effectiveness in preventing chronic organ damage is still unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the role of hydroxyurea in preventing organ morbidity. METHOD: We included original articles published in English from 1st January 1990 to 31st January 2023, reporting hydroxyurea therapy and organ damage from PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, and CrossRef databases. A total of 45 studies with 4681 sickle cell disease patients were evaluated for organ damage. RESULTS: Our analysis showed that hydroxyurea intervention significantly lowered transcranial Doppler and tricuspid regurgitant velocity, with a standardized mean difference of - 1.03 (- 1.49; - 0.58); I 2 = 96% and - 1.37 (CI - 2.31, - 0.42); I 2 = 94%, respectively. Moreover, the pooled estimate for albuminuria showed a beneficial effect post-hydroxyurea therapy by reducing the risk of albuminuria by 58% (risk ratio of 0.42 (0.28; 0.63); I 2 = 28%). CONCLUSION: Our study found that a hydroxyurea dose above 20 mg/kg/day with a mean rise in HbF by 18.46% post-hydroxyurea therapy had a beneficial role in reducing transcranial doppler velocity, tricuspid regurgitant velocity, albuminuria, and splenic abnormality.

38429041		The Inequality of Pain Control in Patients With Pain From Sickle Cell Disease: A Case Report.Approximately 100,000 people in the United States are affected by Sickle Cell Disease (SCD). Acute pain and chronic pain are common and are experienced by everyone with SCD. Children and adolescents who had pain from SCD reported daily pain, decreased function, missed school/workdays, and limited participation in recreational and social activities. This case report aims to highlight the lack of diversity, equity, and inclusion of pain control through the lens of a patient with SCD to improve clinical practice.
37939876		Prevention of neurovascular complications in children with Sickle Cell Disease in the real-world setting: What adult medicine physicians should know.Neurovascular complications represent one of the most detrimental manifestations of Sickle Cell Disease (SCD), affecting many patients since infancy. They include overt stroke, silent cerebral infarcts and neurocognitive disorders. In fact, neurodevelopment can be impaired in children resulting in cognitive dysfunction in adults with SCD. This review is meant to resume the most recent guidelines about the prevention of SCD neurovascular complications and to highlight the open challenges in their implementation. Transcranial Doppler, Magnetic Resonance Imaging/Angiography and neurocognitive test are useful screening tools. Chronic transfusion regimen, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and neurocognitive rehabilitation find indications in the context of primary and secondary prevention of neurovascular complications of SCD. However, international guidelines are often difficult to bring into the real world due to the lack of appropriate instruments and trained personnel. Many challenges have still to be faced to guarantee the best possible neurocognitive function to each child affected by SCD.
37883315		Longer length peripheral catheters in sickle cell treatment: a more efficient and cost-effective care pathway.Patients with sickle cell disease require frequent venous access for red blood cell exchange transfusions to manage their condition. Such frequent access can lead to scar tissue formation, increased pain on insertion, and difficult vascular access for the patients. Previous attempts at achieving successful venous access for patients with difficult venous access has been made with central venous lines, usually femoral lines, which required a large amount of nursing input and resulted in anxiety and pain on insertion for patients. In this article, the author reports on a new pathway with a longer-length peripheral intravenous catheter that reduces the nursing time burden during line insertion, requires less equipment and, crucially, results in a less painful procedure for patients. The increased efficiency of the pathway resulted in a cost saving of $149 per insertion, and patient feedback revealed that the longer-length catheter was preferred over femoral lines.
37917573		Painless Orbital Bone Infarction in a Child with Sickle Cell Anemia: A Case of Misdiagnosed Periorbital Cellulitis.BACKGROUND Sickle cell orbitopathy is a rare complication of sickle cell disease that closely mimics other conditions, such as orbital cellulitis and osteomyelitis. We report a case of painless orbital bone infarction masquerading as periorbital cellulitis in a child with sickle cell anemia. CASE REPORT A 4-year-old Saudi girl with sickle cell disease presented to our hospital with vaso-occlusive crisis characterized by bilateral lower limb pain and painless left orbital swelling. On examination, she had swelling of the left upper eyelid with redness and mild ptosis (margin reflex distance 1 was 2 mm) without proptosis. Magnetic resonance imaging with contrast showed bilateral sub-periosteal heterogeneous collections (2x0.8x2.1 cm in the superolateral wall of the left orbit and 1x0.6 cm in the inferolateral wall of the right orbit), with intermediate-to-high T1 signal intensity and high T2 signal, causing a mass effect on the adjacent superior and lateral rectus muscles. The patient was treated with systemic antibiotics and supportive treatment for vaso-occlusive crisis under the care of the pediatric team and was discharged without complications. CONCLUSIONS The diagnosis of sickle cell orbitopathy can be challenging, and an accurate diagnosis is essential to ensure appropriate management. Thus, we report the case of a 4-year-old child with painless sickle cell orbitopathy masquerading as pre-septal cellulitis.

On 11 September 2023, motixafortide was approved in the USA for use in combination with filgrastim [granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF)] to mobilize HSCs to the peripheral blood for collection and subsequent autologous transplantation in patients with multiple myeloma. Motixafortide has been granted Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of pancreatic cancer in the EU and the USA, and for the treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia in the USA. Clinical development is ongoing for the mobilization of CD34+ HSCs for gene therapy in patients with sickle cell disease. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of motixafortide leading to this first approval.
38206762		Managing sickle cell disease and related complications in pregnancy: results of an international Delphi panel.Data to guide evidence-based management of pregnant people with sickle cell disease (SCD) is limited. This international Delphi panel aimed to identify consensus among multidisciplinary experts for SCD management during pregnancy. The two-round Delphi process used questionnaires exploring seven topics (antenatal care, hydroxyurea use, transfusion, prevention of complications, treatment of complications, delivery and follow-up, and bottlenecks and knowledge gaps) developed by a steering committee. Thirteen panelists (hematologists, physiologists, obstetricians, maternal fetal medicine and transfusion medicine physicians) from the US, the UK, Turkey and France completed the first survey; 12 panelists completed the second round. Anonymized responses were collected and summarized by a contract research organization (Akkodis Belgium). Consensus/strong consensus was predefined as 75%-90% (9-10/12)/>90% ( 11/12) of panelists agreeing or disagreeing on a response to a predefined clinical scenario or statement. In several areas of SCD management, consensus was achieved: experts recommended performing at least monthly multidisciplinary antenatal follow-up, administering prophylactic aspirin for preeclampsia prevention between gestational weeks 12-36, initiating prophylactic transfusion therapy in certain cases, or choosing automated red blood cell exchange over other transfusion methods in patients with iron overload or severe acute chest syndrome. No consensus was reached on several topics including the prophylactic aspirin dose, indications for starting infection prophylaxis, routine use of prophylactic transfusions, or use of prophylactic transfusions for preventing fetal complications. These recommendations could inform clinical care for pregnant SCD patients in the absence of large clinical trials involving this population; the identified knowledge gaps can orient future research.
38321797		Clinicopathologic Study of Sickle Cell-associated Kidney Disease: A Nigerian Experience.BACKGROUND: Improvements in sickle cell disease (SCD) care have resulted in the survival of many patients into adulthood, although this is accompanied by the increased incidence of end-organ damage, including chronic kidney disease (CKD). OBJECTIVES: This study assessed the prevalence, pattern and predictors of renal dysfunction in SCD patients and investigated the associated renal histopathologic changes. METHODS: We evaluated 105 patients with SCD, for proteinuria, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and tubular dysfunction. Renal biopsy was conducted on 22 patients who qualified. Data were analysed using SPSS package version 23. RESULTS: Thirty-seven (35.2%) of the 105 patients had CKD, as defined by an eGFR of 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 and/or proteinuria. The fractional excretion of potassium (FEK) was elevated in all patients, whereas the fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) was elevated in 98.1%. Glomerular filtration rate was negatively correlated with irreversible percentage sickle cell count (r = -0.616, P = 0.0001), FEK (r = -0.448, P = 0.0001) and FENa (r = -0.336, P = 0.004). Age, irreversible percentage sickle cell count, haemoglobin levels and FENa were the major predictors of CKD. The histological pattern in the 22 patients who had biopsies was consistent with mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis 11 (50%), minimal change disease 6 (27.3%), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis 3 (13.6%) and interstitial nephritis 2 (9.1%). CONCLUSIONS: CKD was prevalent in SCD patients, and it was characterised by tubular dysfunction and mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis. The main predictors of CKD were increased age, severity of vaso-occlusive crisis, worsening anaemia and tubular dysfunction.
38418238		Sickle Eye Project: a cross-sectional, non-interventional study of the prevalence of visual impairment due to sickle cell retinopathy and maculopathy in the UK.INTRODUCTION: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the most common genetic disorders in the UK, with over 15 000 people affected. Proliferative sickle cell retinopathy (SCR) is a well-described complication of SCD and can result in significant sight loss, although the prevalence in the UK is not currently known. There are currently no national screening guidelines for SCR, with wide variations in the management of the condition across the UK. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Sickle Eye Project is an epidemiological, cross-sectional, non-interventional study to determine the prevalence of visual impairment due to SCR and/or maculopathy in the UK. Haematologists in at least 16 geographically dispersed hospitals in the UK linked to participating eye clinics will offer study participation to consecutive patients meeting the inclusion criteria attending the sickle cell clinic. The following study procedures will be performed: (a) best corrected visual acuity with habitual correction and pinhole, (b) dilated slit lamp biomicroscopy and funduscopy, (c) optical coherence tomography (OCT), (d) OCT angiography where available, (e) ultrawide fundus photography, (f) National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire-25 and (g) acceptability of retinal screening questionnaire. The primary outcome is the proportion of people with SCD with visual impairment defined as logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution >=0.3 in at least one eye. Secondary outcomes include the prevalence of each stage of SCR and presence of maculopathy by age and genotype; correlation of stage of SCR and maculopathy to severity of SCD; the impact of SCR and presence of maculopathy on vision-related quality of life; and the acceptability to patients of routine retinal imaging for SCR and maculopathy. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was obtained from the South Central-Oxford A Research Ethics Committee (REC 23/SC/0363). Findings will be reported through academic journals in ophthalmology and haematology.
37795523		Busulfan-fludarabine- or treosulfan-fludarabine-based conditioning before allogeneic HSCT from matched sibling donors in paediatric patients with sickle cell disease: A study on behalf of the EBMT Paediatric Diseases and Inborn Errors Working Parties.How important is choice of conditioning regimen in allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for sickle cell disease (SCD)? We compared HSCT outcomes by conditioning regimen in paediatric patients with SCD from the EBMT registry. In 2010-2020, 251 patients aged <18 years underwent a first matched sibling donor (MSD) HSCT with conditioning based on busulfan-fludarabine (bu-flu; n = 89) or treosulfan-fludarabine (treo-flu; n = 162). In the bu-flu and treo-flu groups, 51.7% and 99.4% of patients, respectively, received thiotepa. Median follow-up was 2.7 years. Two-year overall survival (OS) was 98.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 90.9-99.8) with bu-flu and 99.3% (95% CI: 95.2-99.9) with treo-flu (p = 0.63). Grade III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) at 100 days was 2.4% (95% CI: 0.4-7.5) and 0.6% (0.1%-3.2%) for bu-flu and treo-flu respectively (p = 0.25). The 2-year incidence of extensive chronic GVHD was 1.5% (95% CI: 0.1-7.3) with bu-flu and 8.0% (95% CI: 4.1-13.3) with treo-flu (p = 0.057). These multinational data confirm the excellent curative capacity of MSD HSCT with myeloablative conditioning. Both conditioning regimens yielded excellent OS, low rates of acute and chronic GVHD, and low rates of graft failure.

37803527		Natural history of blood pressure in sickle cell disease pregnancy.In this retrospective cohort study of singleton pregnancies in people with sickle cell disease (SCD) delivered at two academic centres between 1990 and 2021, we collected demographic and SCD-related data, pregnancy outcomes, and the highest systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP) at seven time periods. We compared blood pressure values and trajectories in the composite cohort and in each genotype group to control values in a non-SCD pregnancy dataset. There were 290 pregnancies among 197 patients with SCD. Sixteen per cent (n = 47) of pregnancies had a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy (HDP); the rates did not differ by genotype. The mean SBP and DBP were lower in the HbSS/HbSbeta0 group than in the non-SCD control group at all timepoints. Mean SBP and DBP trajectories were similar between the HbSS/HbSbeta0 group and non-SCD controls, whereas the mean SBP and DBP in the HbSC/HbSbeta+ group decreased between the first and second trimesters and plateaued between the second and third trimesters. There were no differences in blood pressure trajectory by haemoglobin >/< 10 gm/dL or by chronic transfusion status. Overall, pregnant people with SCD have lower blood pressure than unaffected pregnant people, raising the possibility that HDP are underdiagnosed, particularly in people with HbSS/HbSbeta0 .

Here, we used whole-genome sequencing to track hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from six patients with SCD at pre- and post-GT time points to map the somatic mutation and clonal landscape of gene-modified and unmodified HSCs. Pre-GT, phylogenetic trees were highly polyclonal and mutation burdens per cell were elevated in some, but not all, patients. Post-GT, no clonal expansions were identified among gene-modified or unmodified cells; however, an increased frequency of potential driver mutations associated with myeloid neoplasms or clonal hematopoiesis (DNMT3A- and EZH2-mutated clones in particular) was observed in both genetically modified and unmodified cells, suggesting positive selection of mutant clones during GT. This work sheds light on HSC clonal dynamics and the mutational landscape after GT in SCD, highlighting the enhanced fitness of some HSCs harboring pre-existing driver mutations. Future studies should define the long-term fate of mutant clones, including any contribution to expansions associated with myeloid neoplasms.
38285418		Priapism in a Young Adult With Sickle Cell Disease.This article presents a case study focusing on priapism in a patient with sickle cell disease, with repeated emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations. The patient was successfully identified and treated by the ED nurse practitioner (NP) with aspiration of the corpus cavernosum. Priapism is a persistent penile erection that continues for an extended time. There is some argument about what that length of time is, but generally, the consensus is more than 4 hr beyond sexual stimulation or unrelated to sexual stimulation or sexual interest (Bivalacqua et al., 2022). Priapism is a fairly common but underrecognized complication of sickle cell disease. It represents a urological emergency in which timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment are vital to preserving penile tissue and sexual function. The diagnosis is made clinically with a comprehensive history, physical examination, and appropriate laboratory test values. Initial management can be conservative with hydration and analgesics or, if necessary, more invasive with needle aspiration to promote detumescence. Permanent tissue damage or erectile dysfunction can result if priapism is unrecognized, untreated, or not treated immediately. The NP plays an integral role in treating and preventing permanent damage. Patient education should focus on instructions for preventing priapism and managing episodes at home.
38031035	associate|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell|@GENE_CST3	Cystatin C-derived estimated glomerular filtration rate in children with sickle cell anaemia.BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease is the most common inherited blood disorder in humans and constitutes a major public health burden. It is a multisystemic condition with long-term renal complications. Early detection of sickle cell nephropathy and initiation of appropriate interventions are associated with improved survival and quality of life. This study aimed to compare the cystatin C-derived estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of the study groups and also, to correlate the clinical features of chronic kidney disease (CKD) with decreased GFR in children with sickle cell anaemia (SCA). METHODS: This hospital-based cross-sectional analytic study recruited 86 SCA subjects in steady-state and 86 age and sex-matched healthy HbAA controls aged 1-14 years who attended the Paediatric Haematology and Outpatient clinics of Federal Medical Centre Bida over six months. Data were collected using a semi-structured questionnaire, and participants' length/height, weight, and blood pressure were measured using standard procedures. Blood samples were drawn for serum cystatin C assay via the sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique. Filler's equation was used to calculate the glomerular filtration rate. RESULTS: There was a significant difference in the mean cystatin C-derived GFR between the two groups, i.e. 116 +- 30mL/min/1.73m2 vs. 106 +- 24mL/min/1.73m2 for the SCA and control groups, respectively (p = 0.017). The prevalence of supernormal GFR (i.e. GFR > 140mL/min/1.73m2) and decreased GFR (i.e. GFR < 90mL/min/1.73m2) was 19.8% and 22.1%, respectively, in children with SCA. There was no significant association between the age at diagnosis of SCA, blood transfusions, blood pressure, packed cell volume and presence of peripheral oedema with decreased GFR in the study subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Supernormal GFR is common in children with SCA and there is no significant association between clinical features of CKD with decreased GFR. Regular evaluation of renal function is, however, recommended in children with SCA for early detection and treatment of renal complications in order to halt the progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD).
37865180		Multi-component Strategy Improves HPV Vaccination Rates among Adolescents with Sickle Cell Disease.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a vaccine strategy bundle to increase HPV vaccine initiation and completion in a specialty clinic setting. STUDY DESIGN: Our Hematology clinic utilized an implementation framework from October 1, 2018, to December 31, 2019, involving nurses, nursing coordinators, and clinicians in administering the HPV vaccination series to our adolescent sickle cell sample of nearly 500 patients. The bundle included education for staff on the need for HPV vaccine administration, provider incentives, vaccines offered to patients in SCD clinics, and verification of patients' charts of vaccine completion. RESULTS: Following the implementation of the bundle, the cumulative incidence of HPV vaccination initiation and completion improved from 28% to 46% and 7% to 49%, respectively. Both rates remained higher post-implementation as well. HPV vaccination series completion was associated with a decreased distance to the healthcare facility, lower state deprivation rank, and increased hospitalizations. CONCLUSION: Our clinic's implementation strategy successfully improved vaccine completion rates among adolescents with SCD while continuing to educate staff, patients, and families on the importance of cancer prevention among people living with SCD.
37832631		CRISPR-based precision medicine for hematologic disorders: Advancements, challenges, and prospects.The development of programmable nucleases to introduce defined alterations in genomic sequences has been a powerful tool for precision medicine. While several nucleases such as zinc-finger nucleases (ZFN), transcriptor activator-like effector nucleases (TALEN), and meganucleases have been explored, the advent of CRISPR/Cas9 technology has revolutionized the field of genome engineering. In addition to disease modeling, the CRISPR/Cas9 technology has contributed to safer and more effective treatment strategies for hematologic diseases and personalized T-cell-based therapies. Here we discuss the applications of the CRISPR technology in the treatment of hematologic diseases, their efficacy, and ongoing clinical trials. We examine the obstacles to their successful use and the approaches investigated to overcome these challenges. Finally, we provide our perspectives to improve this genome editing tool for targeted therapies.
38010293		Defining curative endpoints for sickle cell disease in the era of gene therapy and gene editing.A growing number of gene therapy- and gene editing-based treatments for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) are entering clinical trials. These treatments, designed to target the underlying cause of SCD, have the potential to provide functional cures, which until now were possible only through allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. However, as these novel approaches advance from early- to late-stage clinical trials, it is essential to identify physiologically and clinically relevant endpoints that can demonstrate the achievement of a functional cure for SCD. Here, we present an overview of the pathophysiology of SCD and current treatment options, review ongoing SCD clinical trials using gene therapy or gene editing approaches, and identify the most relevant endpoints for demonstrating the attainment of a functional cure for SCD.
37952647	associate|@CHEMICAL_titanium_silicide|@DISEASE_Fibrosis	Improvement in cardiac morphology demonstrated by CMR and echo after haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplant in adults with sickle cell disease.Cardiopulmonary complications account for approximately 40% of deaths in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Diffuse myocardial fibrosis, elevated tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity (TRV) and iron overload are all associated with early mortality. While HLA-matched sibling hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) offers a potential cure, fewer than 20% of patients have a suitable donor. Haploidentical HCT allows for an increased donor pool and has recently demonstrated improved safety and efficacy. Our group has reported improved cardiac morphology via echocardiography at one year after HCT. Herein, we describe the first use of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR), the gold standard for measuring volume, mass, and ventricular function, to evaluate changes in cardiac morphology post-HCT in adults with SCD. We analyzed baseline and 1-year data from 12 adults with SCD who received nonmyeloablative haploidentical peripheral blood HCT at the NIH. Patients underwent non-contrast CMR at 3T, echocardiography, and laboratory studies. One year after HCT, patients showed marked improvement in cardiac chamber morphology by CMR, including left ventricular (LV) mass and volume (70.2 to 60.1 g/m2, p = 0.02; 114.5 to 90.6 mL/m2, p = 0.001). Furthermore, mean TRV normalized by 1 year, suggesting that HCT may offer a survival benefit. Fewer patients had pathologically prolonged native myocardial T1 times, an indirect marker of myocardial fibrosis at 1 year; these data showed a trend toward significance. In this small sample, CMR was very sensitive in detecting cardiac mass and volume changes after HCT and provided complementary information to echocardiography. Notably, post-HCT improvement in cardiac parameters can be attributed only in part to the resolution of anemia; further studies are required to determine the role of myocardial fibrosis reversal, improved blood flow, and survival impact after HCT for SCD.

37929626		Safety of Ultrasound Contrast Agents in Pediatric Patients With Sickle Cell Disease and Trait.Ultrasound contrast agent (UCA) use is increasing. Recent isolated reports observed a rise in pain-related adverse events with the intravenous administration of the UCA Definity in adults with sickle cell disease. To date, no studies have investigated the incidence of similar adverse events with UCA Lumason or Optison. We describe our experience regarding the safety of Lumason and Optison in children with sickle cell disease and trait who underwent contrast-enhanced ultrasound exams in our department with intravenous, intravesical, and other intracavitary routes. No pain-related or other adverse events were observed in this pediatric population with any route of UCA administration.
38161155		Management of Acute Sickle Cell Disease Pain.Pain is a common complication of sickle cell disease. Sickle cell pain can often be effectively managed by pediatricians in outpatient and hospital settings. Acute pain management should be initiated quickly. Patients need to be evaluated for sickle cell complications and other causes of pain. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids are the mainstay of pain treatment, but additional therapies include hydration, local pain control, muscle relaxants, and nonpharmacologic approaches. Healthy lifestyle habits and good behavioral and mental health are important for preventing and coping with sickle cell disease pain. Disease-modifying therapies, such as hydroxyurea, can help prevent sickle hemoglobin polymerization and acute pain episodes. Because sickle cell disease largely affects people who are racialized minorities in the United States, health-care providers need to be aware of how their own personal biases may affect care of these patients.
38263886		Reversal of Cerebral Arteriopathy Post-Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant for Sickle Cell Disease.Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a chronic hematologic disorder which causes progressive cerebral arteriopathy beginning in childhood. As a result, arterial ischemic stroke is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in SCD, and SCD is a leading cause of childhood stroke worldwide. Allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) may be curative for individuals with SCD. Long-term outcomes and effects are currently being studied. In this report, we describe a child with SCD who presented with arterial ischemic stroke at 6 years of age and was found to have a severe form of cerebral large vessel arteriopathy by catheter-directed angiography. The patient initially underwent revascularization surgery by indirect superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery bypass, and 1 year later, he underwent curative HSCT. Approximately 3 years after HSCT, repeat catheter-directed angiography revealed a striking reversal of cerebral large vessel arteriopathy. This article reveals a previously unrecognized and potentially beneficial effect of HSCT that may ameliorate cerebral large vessel arteriopathy and improve cerebrovascular health for children with SCD.
38409146		The Evaluation of Invasive Prenatal Diagnostic Tests in North Cyprus: A Retrospective Study.BACKGROUND: Congenital diseases are still an important medical, social, and economic problem all over the world. In North Cyprus, in addition to other reasons, early prenatal diagnostic measures are undertaken to prevent births with thalassemia major, a locally widespread genetic disease. AIM: This study aims to evaluate the results of prenatal invasive diagnostic tests performed in a private obstetrics clinic in Northern Cyprus and show the diagnosis process of thalassemia and chromosomal anomalies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study is a retrospective, descriptive study. Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) results and the amniocentesis tests performed between 1990 and 2022 are evaluated. Thalassemia and chromosome analysis of samples obtained by CVS and amniocentesis tests were performed. To diagnose alpha or beta thalassemia and sickle cell, 239 CVS was performed. And to diagnose chromosomal anomalies, 396 CVS and amniocentesis were performed. RESULTS: The mean age of the 480 pregnant women included in the study was 31.12 years (18-46) and 30% of them were older than 34 years. The most common indications for invasive prenatal diagnostic test (IPDT) were; mother/father thalassemia minor/major, advanced maternal age, high risk of ultrasonography erase findings, and the noninvasive screening test. The result of IPDT detected 7.3% chromosomal anomaly and 69.5% thalassemia and sickle cell anemia. Of the 239 CVS performed to diagnose alpha or beta thalasemia and sickle cell, 23.4% beta major, 42.3% beta minor, and 2.1% alpha minor were diagnosed. Of the 396 CVS and amniocentesis performed to diagnose chromosomal anormalies; 2.8% of Down syndrome and 4.54% of other chromosomal anomalies were diagnosed. CONCLUSION: IPDT is important in correctly diagnosing fetal anomalies at the prenatal stage to help families decide at the right time.
37953236		"The project did not come to us with a solution": Perspectives of research teams on implementing a study about electronic health record-embedded individualized pain plans for emergency department treatment of vaso-occlusive episodes in adults with sickle cell disease.BACKGROUND: This study aimed to capture the implementation process of the ALIGN Study, (An individualized Pain Plan with Patient and Provider Access for Emergency Department care of Sickle Cell Disease). ALIGN aimed to embed Individualized Pain Plans in the electronic health record (E-IPP) and provide access to the plan for both adult patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and emergency department providers when a person with SCD comes to the emergency department in vaso-occlusive crises. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with research teams from the 8 participating sites from the ALIGN study. Seventeen participants (principal investigators and study coordinators) shared their perspectives about the implementation of ALIGN in their sites. Data were analyzed in three phases using open coding steps adapted from grounded theory and qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: A total of seven overarching themes were identified: (1) the E-IPP structure (location and upkeep) and collaboration with the informatics team, (2) the role of ED champion, (3) the role of research coordinators, (4) research team communication, and communication between research team and clinical team, (5) challenges with the study protocol, (6) provider feedback: addressing over-utilizers, patient mistrust, and the positive feedback about the intervention, and (7) COVID-19 and its effects on study implementation. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study contribute to learning how to implement E-IPPs for adult patients with SCD in ED. The study findings highlight the importance of early engagement with different team members, a champion from the emergency department, study coordinators with different skills and enhancement of communication and trust among team members. Further recommendations are outlined for hospitals aiming to implement E-IPP for patients with SCD in ED.
38050205		Nosocomial infections in sickle cell anemia patients: Prevention through multi-disciplinary approach: A review.Sickle cell anemia (SCA), a hereditary blood disorder characterized by the presence of abnormal hemoglobin, poses a unique set of challenges for both patients and healthcare providers. One of the most pressing issues in the care of these individuals is the persistent threat of nosocomial infections, which are infections acquired during hospitalization. This abstract provides a concise overview of the ongoing challenge of nosocomial infections in SCA patients, highlighting the factors contributing to their vulnerability and the preventive measures in place. SCA patients face increased susceptibility to nosocomial infections due to their compromised immune systems, frequent hospitalizations, prolonged stays, and the need for invasive medical interventions. The emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens further complicates the management of these infections. To address this challenge, healthcare facilities have implemented infection control protocols, vaccination strategies, and antimicrobial stewardship, emphasizing the importance of patient education. Recognizing the gravity of this issue and adopting comprehensive preventive measures is crucial to improving the quality of care and patient outcomes in this vulnerable population. Further research and ongoing efforts are essential to reducing the burden of nosocomial infections in SCA patients and enhancing their overall healthcare experience.
37933708		Impact of a hospital service for adults with chronic childhood-onset disease: A propensity weighted analysis.BACKGROUND: Young adults with chronic childhood-onset diseases (CCOD) transitioning care from pediatrics to adult care are at high risk for readmission after hospital discharge. At our institution, we have implemented an inpatient service, the Med-Peds (MP) line, to improve transitions to adult care and reduce hospital utilization by young adults with CCOD. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the effect of the MP line on length of stay (LOS) and 30-day readmission rates compared to other inpatient services. METHODS: This was an observational, retrospective cohort analysis of patients admitted to the MP line compared to other hospital service lines over a 2-year period. To avoid potential confounding by indication for admission to the MP line, propensity score weighting methods were used. RESULTS: The MP line cared for 302 patients with CCOD from June 2019 to July 2021. Compared to other service lines, there was a 33% reduction in relative risk of 30-day readmission (26.9% compared to 40.3%, risk ratio = 0.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.55-0.81). LOS was 10% longer for the MP line (event time ratio (ETR): 1.10 95% CI 1.0-1.21) with median LOS 4.8 versus 4.5 days. Patients with sickle cell disease had less of a reduction in 30-day readmissions and longer LOS. CONCLUSION: Hospitalization for young adults with CCOD on a MP service line was associated with lower 30-day readmission rates and longer LOS than hospitalization on other services. Further research is needed to assess which components of the line most contribute to decreased utilization.
38066927		Gene therapy for sickle cell disease.Sickle cell disease (SCD) is potentially curable after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or autologous HSCT after ex vivo genetic modification. Autologous HSCT with gene therapy has the potential to overcome many of the limitations of allogeneic HSCT that include the lack of suitable donors, graft-versus-host disease, the need for immune suppression, and the potential for graft rejection. Significant progress in gene therapy for SCD has been made over the past several decades, now with a growing number of clinical trials investigating various gene addition and gene editing strategies. Available results from a small number of patients, some with relatively short follow-up, are promising as a potentially curative strategy, with current efforts focused on continuing to improve the efficacy, durability, and safety of gene therapies for the cure of SCD.
37933199		Imaging of pediatric skull lytic lesions: A review.Skull lesions in pediatric population are common findings on imaging and sometimes with heterogeneous manifestations, constituting a diagnostic challenge. Some lesions can be misinterpreted for their aggressiveness, as with larger lesions eroding cortical bone, containing soft tissue components, leading to excessive and, in some cases, invasive inappropriate etiological investigation. In this review, we present multiple several conditions that may present as skull lesions or pseudolesions, organized by groups (anatomic variants, congenital and development disorders, traumatic injuries, vascular issues, infectious conditions, and tumoral processes). Anatomic variants are common imaging findings that must be recognized by the neuroradiologist. Congenital malformations are rare conditions, such as aplasia cutis congenita and sinus pericranii, usually seen at earlier ages, the majority of which are benign findings. In case of trauma, cephalohematoma, growing skull fractures, and posttraumatic lytic lesions should be considered. Osteomyelitis tends to be locally aggressive and may mimic malignancy, in which cases, the clinical history can be the key to diagnosis. Vascular (sickle cell disease) and tumoral (aneurismal bone cyst, eosinophilic granuloma, metastases) lesions are relatively rare lesions but should be considered in the differential diagnosis, in the presence of certain imaging findings. The main difficulty is the differentiation between the benign and malignant nature; therefore, the main objective of this pictorial essay is to review the main skull lytic lesions found in pediatric age, describing the main findings in different imaging modalities (CT and MRI), allowing the neuroradiologist greater confidence in establishing the differential diagnosis, through a systematic and simple characterization of the lesions.
37855191		Right atrial thrombus removal with use of the ONO retrieval device.Intracardiac masses and specifically right atrial thrombi can be difficult to manage and carry a high mortality rate. Typically, surgical removal or mechanical thrombectomy can be performed though may not be suitable for all patients. We present a unique case of a sickle cell patient with a large pedunculated right atrial thrombus that was successfully extracted using the novel ONO Retrieval Device.
38130071		Reevaluation of the medical necessity of washed red blood cell transfusion in chronically transfused adults.BACKGROUND: Washing red blood cell (RBC) units mitigates severe allergic transfusion reactions. However, washing reduces the time to expiration and the effective dose. Automated washing is time- and labor-intensive. A shortage of cell processor tubing sets prompted review of medical necessity for washed RBC for patients previously thought to require washing. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A single-center, retrospective study investigated discontinuing wash RBC protocols in chronically transfused adults. In select patients with prior requirements for washing, due to a history of allergic transfusion reactions, trials of unwashed transfusions were performed. Patient demographic, clinical, laboratory, and transfusion data were compiled. The per-unit washing cost was the sum of the tubing set, saline, and technical labor costs. RESULTS: Fifteen patients (median age 34 years interquartile range [IQR] 23-53 years, 46.7% female) were evaluated. These patients had been transfused with a median of 531 washed RBC units (IQR 244-1066) per patient over 12 years (IQR 5-18 years), most commonly for recurrent, non-severe allergic reactions. There were no transfusion reactions with unwashed RBCs aside from one patient with one episode of pruritus and another with recurrent pruritus, which was typical even with washed RBC. We decreased the mean number of washed RBC units per month by 72.9% (104   10 vs. 28.2   25.2; p < .0001) and saved US $100.25 per RBC unit. CONCLUSION: Washing of RBCs may be safely reconsidered in chronically transfused patients without a history of anaphylaxis. Washing should be implemented judiciously due to potential lack of necessity and logistical/operational challenges.
38204310		Newborn screening for sickle cell anemia in Antalya, Turkiye.BACKGROUND: In a screening study conducted on adults, the prevalence of sickle cell traits in Antalya was found to be 0.24%. Since no screening studies have been conducted in the neonatal period in our region, the exact incidence has not been determined. In this study, we aim to report our experience of neonatal screening for sickle cell disease in Antalya, Turkiye. METHODS: During a 14-month period, 2562 heel prick blood samples, taken on filter paper from Akdeniz University Hospital, Antalya Education and Research Hospital and Antalya Ataturk State Hospital and four other healthcare centers, were studied using the high pressure liquid chromatography method. Blood samples were studied using the `Sickle Cell Short Program` test method on a Bio Rad Variant device. RESULTS: In the study, no patients with sickle cell disease were identified. Four newborns who were sickle cell carriers (0.15%) and two newborns who were Hemoglobin D carriers (0.08 %), were found. CONCLUSION: Considering the efficiency and cost calculations made as a result of the data obtained from our study, it was concluded that sickle cell screening would not be effective in newborns. It seems more effective and economical to screen the children of parents, who are found to be at risk for Hemoglobin S carriage as a result of premarital tests.
37914454		"SCULP" study: The benefits of skin graft pellets on the pain of sickle cell leg ulcers (SCLU).BACKGROUND: Leg ulcers associated with major sickle cell disease (SCLU) are a chronic, painful complication, often treated by autologous skin graft. The analgesic effect of skin grafting in SCLU is poorly studied. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of skin grafting on the pain and healing of SCLU. METHODS: Patients hospitalized for SCLU skin grafting were included in a retrospective and prospective observational cohort, between 2019 and 2023: 53 autologous pinch grafts were performed on a total of 35 SCLUs in 25 sickle cell patients. The primary endpoint was the evaluation of the analgesic effect of the skin graft, measured by visual analog scale (VAS) and weekly cumulative analgesic consumption between day (D)0, D7 and D30. Wound healing was assessed by variation in wound areas between D0 and D30. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients with a median age range of 45.5years old were included, 68% were men, SS genotype was present in 96% of the cases. At D7, a significant decrease in VAS and consumption of analgesics of all classes was observed. At D30, only a significant decrease in VAS and consumption of mild opioids was present, as well as a significant reduction in wound surface area compared with D0. CONCLUSION: Pinch grafts have a significant early analgesic effect in the management of patients with SCLU, and significantly notice reduction of wound surface area within one month.

This study investigates GLOBE-based lentiviral vectors (LVs) for b<sup>AS3</sup>-globin addition and evaluates strategies for an increased b-like globin expression without vector dose escalation. First, we report the development of a GLOBE-derived LV, GLV2-bAS3, which, compared to its parental vector, adds anti-sickling action and a transcription-enhancing 848-bp transcription terminator element, retains high vector titers and allows for superior b-like globin expression in primary patient-derived hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Second, prompted by our previous correction of <i>HBB<sup>IVSI-110(G>A)</sup></i> thalassemia based on RNApol(III)-driven shRNAs in mono- and combination therapy, we analyzed a series of novel LVs for the RNApol(II)-driven constitutive or late-erythroid expression of <i>HBB<sup>IVSI-110(G>A)</sup></i>-specific miRNA30-embedded shRNAs (shRNAmiR). This included bifunctional LVs, allowing for concurrent b<sup>AS3</sup>-globin expression. LVs were initially compared for their ability to achieve high b-like globin expression in <i>HBB<sup>IVSI-110(G>A)</sup></i>-transgenic cells, before the evaluation of shortlisted candidate LVs in <i>HBB<sup>IVSI-110(G>A)</sup></i>-homozygous HSPCs. The latter revealed that b-globin promoter-driven designs for monotherapy with <i>HBB<sup>IVSI-110(G>A)</sup></i>-specific shRNAmiRs only marginally increased b-globin levels compared to untransduced cells, whereas bifunctional LVs combining miR30-shRNA with b<sup>AS3</sup>-globin expression showed disease correction similar to that achieved by the parental GLV2-bAS3 vector. Our results establish the feasibility of high titers for LVs containing the full <i>HBB</i> transcription terminator, emphasize the importance of the <i>HBB</i> terminator for the high-level expression of <i>HBB</i>-like transgenes, qualify the therapeutic utility of late-erythroid <i>HBB<sup>IVSI-110(G>A)</sup></i>-specific miR30-shRNA expression and highlight the exceptional potential of GLV2-bAS3 for the treatment of severe b-hemoglobinopathies.
38066894		The range of haploidentical transplant protocols in sickle cell disease: all haplos are not created equally.The ideal curative therapy for sickle cell disease (SCD) must be applicable across all ages and include individuals with strokes and preexisting heart, lung, and kidney disease. Myeloablative, matched sibling donor hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) for children with SCD has shown excellent outcomes over the past 3 decades but has been restricted due to the limited availability of a human leukocyte antigen-matched sibling donor (10%-15%) and increased treatment-related death in adults with myeloablative conditioning. To overcome these 2 significant barriers to curative therapy in SCD, related haploidentical HCT has become an active area of research. The use of related haploidentical donors (first- and second-degree relatives) increases the donor pool to at least 90% of those eligible across the life span. Importantly, most adults, even with strokes or significant comorbidities, can tolerate the nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen without treatment-related death. Since 2013, at least 3 related haploidentical HCT strategies have emerged as potential curative therapies for SCD: (1) a nonmyeloablative, T-cell replete, bone marrow transplant with thiotepa and posttransplant cyclophosphamide with a goal of complete donor chimerism; (2) a nonmyeloablative, in vivo T-cell depletion, using peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) with a goal of stable mixed donor-recipient chimerism; and (3) a myeloablative, ex vivo T-cell depletion using PBSCs and advanced-technology graft manipulation, with a goal of complete donor chimerism. We review the similarities, differences, outcomes, and gaps in knowledge with these 3 haploidentical HCT approaches for SCD.
38069808		High hydroxyurea usage in sickle cell anemia regardless of patient demographics.Hydroxyurea is highly effective in sickle cell disease, but it is still underutilized. Reports of hydroxyurea utilization largely use Medicaid data, and socioeconomics is often cited as a barrier. To address whether patient demographics influenced the high hydroxyurea usage rate recently reported for the pediatric sickle cell program of Northern Virginia, analysis of data from 2011 to 2021 revealed no statistical difference in hydroxyurea usage rate between Medicaid and non-Medicaid, African American and African, or age less than 13 and age greater than or equal to 13 years cohorts, demonstrating that hydroxyurea can be successfully implemented across demographic groups.
37905989		Preferences for potential benefits and risks for gene therapy in the treatment of sickle cell disease.Objective is to quantify benefit-risk tradeoffs pertaining to potential gene therapies among adults and parents/caregivers of children with sickle-cell disease (SCD). A discrete-choice experiment (DCE) survey was developed in which respondents selected their preferred treatment alternatives in a series of experimentally-controlled pairs of hypothetical gene therapies and a "no gene therapy" option. Gene therapy alternatives were defined based on the chance of eliminating SCD symptoms, expected increases in life expectancy they could offer, treatment-related risk of death and potential increases in lifetime cancer risk. Respondents made selections based on their current disease severity and in the context of expectations of worsened disease. Three clinical sites and one patient organization recruited 174 adult patients and 109 parents of children with SCD to complete the survey. Adult and parent respondents were generally willing to choose gene therapies, but the adults required higher expected levels of efficacy (i.e., higher chance of eliminating symptoms) than parents to choose gene therapies that conferred mortality risks of 10% or more. When adults and parents of children with less severe symptoms were asked to consider scenarios of higher levels of disease severity, the risk tolerance increased, and the lowest acceptable level of efficacy for gene therapies with mortality risks dropped by more than 50%. Baseline SCD symptoms are a major driver of gene therapy acceptability. Adults and parents of patients with milder symptoms may prefer other treatment options; however, an expectation of symptoms deterioration triggers strong reassessment of the acceptable benefit-risk balance of this novel technology.

Although the significance of chronic anemia, hemolysis, and vasculopathy has been established, hemoglobin polymerization, which results in erythrocyte stiffness and Vaso-occlusion, is important to the pathophysiology of this disease. Clinical management is elementary, and there is scant reliable data for many treatments. The onset of cerebrovascular illness and cognitive impairment are two of the major issues associated with sickle cell disease in children, and it is only now that researchers are beginning to understand how blood transfusions and hydroxycarbamide can prevent these complications. When Vaso occlusion and inflammation occur repeatedly, the majority of organs are gradually damaged, including the brain, kidneys, lungs, bones, and cardiovascular system. This damage worsens with age. In our study, we focused on the specific pathways which are affected by the involvement of effected genes. Firstly, we retrieved the gene datasets from the publically available data source website DisGNET. Using literature-based genes, we identified 290 highly regulated genes that are directly associated with sickle cell disease. We subsequently performed a gene expression analysis and extracted a gene set using GEO2R analysis, which was then used to prune 290 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). After pruning we got 60 highly expressed genes. After identification of DEGs, we used these genes for pathway analysis. For the pathway analysis, we used Reactome software and we found that these DEGs are directly associated with 7 different pathways, which are alpha beta signaling pathways, 15 antiviral mechanism, Oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) antiviral response, interleukin 1 signaling pathways, interleukin 4 and 13, interleukin 10 signaling pathway, and aspirin ADME pathway. After pathway analysis, we can exactly relate how sickle cell disease alters the gene expression and how these genes affect the different pathways. Additionally, we performed gene ontology of 60 genes and identified the gene biological process, cellular component, and molecular functions as we mentioned in our results. With the help of our study data, there is a chance for pre-identification of sickle cell disease person. Our gene result was used as a biomarker of sickle cell disease. In this paper, our result is the primary approach for sickle cell disease; with the help of this paper any researcher can get their primary data and use that for further research.
37919142		Haematopoietic stem cell health in sickle cell disease and its implications for stem cell therapies and secondary haematological disorders.Gene modification of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is a potentially curative approach to sickle cell disease (SCD) and offers hope for patients who are not eligible for allogeneic HSC transplantation. Current approaches require in vitro manipulation of healthy autologous HSC prior to their transplantation. However, the health and integrity of HSCs may be compromised by a variety of disease processes in SCD, and challenges have emerged in the clinical trials of gene therapy. There is also concern about increased susceptibility to haematological malignancies during long-term follow up of patients, and this raises questions about genomic stability in the stem cell compartment. In this review, we evaluate the evidence for HSC deficits in SCD and then discuss their potential causation. Finally, we suggest several questions which need to be addressed in order to progress with successful HSC manipulation for gene therapy in SCD.

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is currently the only curative treatment for patients with SCD. Whereas normalization of hemoglobin levels and hemolysis markers has been reported after HSCT, its effects on cerebral perfusion and oxygenation in adult SCD patients remain largely unexplored. This study investigated the effects of HSCT on cerebral blood flow (CBF), oxygen delivery, cerebrovascular reserve (CVR), oxygen extraction fraction (OEF), and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2 ) in 17 adult SCD patients (mean age: 25.0 +- 8.0, 6 females) before and after HSCT and 10 healthy ethnicity-matched controls (mean age: 28.0 +- 8.8, 6 females) using MRI. For the CVR assessment, perfusion scans were performed before and after acetazolamide as a vasodilatory stimulus. Following HSCT, gray and white matter (GM and WM) CBF decreased (p < .01), while GM and WM CVR increased (p < .01) compared with the baseline measures. OEF and CMRO2 also increased towards levels in healthy controls (p < .01). The normalization of cerebral perfusion and oxygen metabolism corresponded with a significant increase in hemoglobin levels and decreases in reticulocytes, total bilirubin, and LDH as markers of hemolysis (p < .01). This study shows that HSCT results in the normalization of cerebral perfusion and oxygen metabolism, even in adult patients with SCD. Future follow-up MRI scans will determine whether the observed normalization of cerebral hemodynamics and oxygen metabolism prevents new silent cerebral infarcts.
38237001		Perspectives of Adolescents and Young Adults With Sickle Cell Disease and Clinicians on Improving Transition Readiness With a Video Game Intervention.We aimed to learn the experiences of clinicians and adolescents and young adults with sickle cell disease (AYA-SCD) with managing their disease at home and making medical decisions as they transition from pediatric to adult care, and their perceptions of a video game intervention to positively impact these skills. We conducted individual, semistructured interviews with patients (AYA-SCD ages 15 to 26 years) and clinicians who provide care to AYA-SCD at an urban, quaternary-care hospital. Interviews elicited patients' and clinicians' experiences with AYA-SCD, barriers and facilitators to successful home management, and their perspectives on shared decision-making and a video game intervention. To identify themes, we conducted an inductive analysis until data saturation was reached. Participants (16 patients and 21 clinicians) identified 4 main themes: (1) self-efficacy as a critical skill for a successful transition from pediatric to adult care, (2) the importance of patient engagement in making medical decisions, (3) multilevel determinants of optimal self-efficacy and patient engagement, and (4) support for a video game intervention which, by targeting potential determinants of AYA-SCD achieving optimal self-efficacy and engagement in decision-making, may improve these important skills.
37800996		Outcomes and long-term effects of hematopoietic stem cell transplant in sickle cell disease.INTRODUCTION: Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is the only readily available curative option for sickle cell disease (SCD). Cure rates following human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched related donor HSCT with myeloablative or non-myeloablative conditioning are > 90%. Alternative donor sources, including haploidentical donor and autologous with gene therapy, expand donor options but are limited by inferior outcomes, limited data, and/or shorter follow-up and therefore remain experimental. AREAS COVERED: Outcomes are improving with time, with donor type and conditioning regimens having the greatest impact on long-term complications. Patients with stable donor engraftment do not experience SCD-related symptoms and have stabilization or improvement of end-organ pathology; however, the long-term effects of curative strategies remain to be fully established and have significant implications in a patient's decision to seek therapy. This review covers currently published literature on HSCT outcomes, including organ-specific outcomes implicated in SCD, as well as long-term effects. EXPERT OPINION: HSCT, both allogeneic and autologous gene therapy, in the SCD population reverses the sickle phenotype, prevents further organ damage, can resolve prior organ dysfunction in both pediatric and adult patients. Data support greater success with HSCT at a younger age, thus, curative therapies should be discussed early in the patient's life.
37951090	cause|@CHEMICAL_Calcium|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell	Calcium flux alterations in erythrocytes from sickle cell mice: The relevance of mean corpuscular volume.Red blood cells (RBC) from patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) have elevated calcium levels at baseline, which are further elevated upon deoxygenation. Here we examined baseline calcium levels and calcium flux in RBCs from a mouse model of SCD mice. We found that akin to humans with SCD, sickle (HbSS) Townes mice, have higher baseline levels and increased calcium flux in RBCs compared to control (HbAA) animals. As HbSS mice, unlike humans with SCD, have high mean corpuscular volume compared with HbAA, we highlight the importance of adjusting biochemical results to number of RBCs rather than hematocrit during the analysis and interpretation of the results. Our findings add to the face validity of humanized sickle cell mice and support its use for studies of RBC calcium flux in SCD.
38066905		Using disease-modifying therapies in sickle cell disease.As curative therapy using allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation as well as gene therapy and gene editing remains inaccessible to most patients with sickle cell disease, the availability of drug therapies that are safe, efficacious, and affordable is highly desirable. Increasing progress is being made in developing drug therapies based on our understanding of disease pathophysiology. Four drugs, hydroxyurea, L-glutamine, crizanlizumab, and voxelotor, are currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, with multiple others at various stages of testing. With the limited efficacy of individual agents, combinations of agents will likely be required for optimal outcomes.
37981193	associate|@CHEMICAL_Urea|@DISEASE_Liver_Failure	The liver in sickle cell disease.Liver involvement in SCD patients is frequent but often misdiagnosed or underestimated, except in case of advanced liver diseases. Because of so far poorly recognized forms of chronic SCD-related vascular injury that can silently evolved towards end stages or facilitate ACLF, any persisting liver function tests abnormalities should be carefully investigated, following the above proposed algorithm. Work up and management must be considered multidisciplinary in relationship with a Hepatologist. Early SCD hepatopathy should prompt revision of SCD management to prevent further liver injury and decompensation, discussing transfusion exchanges and hydro urea when not yet initiated, and control for any cofactor of liver injury. The role of HSCT in early SCD hepatopathies also deserves evaluation. In advanced SCD hepatopathies, liver transplantation, which has been rarely performed so far, is the only therapeutic option associated with improved survival. It should definitely be discussed- either electively in case of decompensation in SCD cirrhosis or jaundice/recurrent cholangitis in cholestatic diseases, with excellent outcome, - or emergently in case of ALF or ACLF with more mitigate results. To improve knowledge and management of SCD liver diseases, creation of national and international registries, as well as longitudinal observational cohorts are encouraged.
38296295		Protocol for an evaluation of the initiation of an integrated longitudinal outpatient care model for severe chronic non-communicable diseases (PEN-Plus) at secondary care facilities (district hospitals) in 10 lower-income countries.INTRODUCTION: The Package of Essential Noncommunicable Disease Interventions-Plus (PEN-Plus) is a strategy decentralising care for severe non-communicable diseases (NCDs) including type 1 diabetes, rheumatic heart disease and sickle cell disease, to increase access to care. In the PEN-Plus model, mid-level clinicians in intermediary facilities in low and lower middle income countries are trained to provide integrated care for conditions where services traditionally were only available at tertiary referral facilities. For the upcoming phase of activities, 18 first-level hospitals in 9 countries and 1 state in India were selected for PEN-Plus expansion and will treat a variety of severe NCDs. Over 3 years, the countries and state are expected to: (1) establish PEN-Plus clinics in one or two district hospitals, (2) support these clinics to mature into training sites in preparation for national or state-level scale-up, and (3) work with the national or state-level stakeholders to describe, measure and advocate for PEN-Plus to support development of a national operational plan for scale-up. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Guided by Proctor outcomes for implementation research, we are conducting a mixed-method evaluation consisting of 10 components to understand outcomes in clinical implementation, training and policy development. Data will be collected through a mix of quantitative surveys, routine reporting, routine clinical data and qualitative interviews. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This protocol has been considered exempt or covered by central and local institutional review boards. Findings will be disseminated throughout the project's course, including through quarterly M&E discussions, semiannual formative assessments, dashboard mapping of progress, quarterly newsletters, regular feedback loops with national stakeholders and publication in peer-reviewed journals.
38262104		Effect of voxelotor on murine bone marrow and peripheral blood with hematopoietic progenitor cell mobilization for gene therapy of sickle cell disease.In preparation for hematopoietic stem cell mobilization and collection, current ex vivo gene therapy protocols for sickle cell disease require patients to undergo several months of chronic red cell transfusion. For health care equity, alternatives to red cell transfusion should be available. We examined whether treatment with GBT1118, the murine analog of voxelotor, could be a safe and feasible alternative to red cell transfusion. We found that 3 weeks of treatment with GBT1118 increased the percentage of bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells and upon plerixafor mobilization, the percentage of peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cells. Our data suggest that voxelotor should be further explored for its potential safety and utility as preparation for hematopoietic stem cell mobilization and collection.

Vaso-occlusion and chronic hemolysis lead to dysfunction to vital organ systems, with the kidneys being among the most commonly affected organs. SUMMARY: Early renal manifestations include medullary ischemia with loss of urine concentrating ability and hyperfiltration. This can be followed by progressive damage characterized by persistent albuminuria and a decline in the estimated glomerular filtration rate. The risk of sickle nephropathy is greater in those with the APOL1 G1 and G2 kidney risk variants and variants in HMOX1 and lower in those that co-inherit alpha-thalassemia. Therapies to treat sickle cell disease-related kidney damage focus on sickle cell disease modifying therapies (e.g. hydroxyurea) or those adopted from the non-sickle cell disease kidney literature (e.g. renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors), although data on their clinical efficacy are limited to small studies with short follow up periods. Kidney transplantation for end-stage kidney disease improves survival compared to hemodialysis but is underutilized in this patient population. KEY MESSAGES: Kidney disease is a major contributor to early mortality and more research is needed to understand the pathophysiology and to develop targeted therapies to improve kidney health in sickle cell disease.

38066847		Managing pregnancy in patients with sickle cell disease from a transfusion perspective.Advances in the management of sickle cell disease (SCD) have made it possible for most female patients (whether homozygous or compound heterozygous) to reach childbearing age and become pregnant. However, even in the less symptomatic forms of SCD a high risk of complications during pregnancy and the postpartum period can occur for both the mother (1% to 2% mortality) and the fetus. Coordinated care from the obstetrician and the sickle cell disease expert is essential, together with the active participation of the patient. Vaso-occlusive complications, such as vaso-occlusive crisis and acute chest syndrome, often increase in frequency when hydroxyurea treatment is interrupted. Obstetric complications, such as pre-eclampsia, fetal growth restriction, and preterm delivery, are more common in women with SCD. Recent meta-analysis-based studies support prophylactic transfusion. However, there have been no randomized trials assessing the benefits of prophylactic transfusion. Given the known risk of transfusion complications, including delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction and hyperhemolysis, transfusion is not systematically performed in pregnant women with SCD. We describe here a case-by-case approach to the management of pregnancy in women with SCD based on the medical and transfusion history of each patient.

METHODS: In this prospective observational study involving children aged 0.5-17 years with SCA requiring hospitalisation, we used serum creatinine level at 0 and 48 h of hospitalisation to determine the presence of AKI. RESULTS: The study involved 155 children with SCA aged 0.5-17 years with a median (interquartile range) age of 7.8 (4.3-11.0) years. Acute kidney injury occurred in 27 (17.4%) children with 33.3% reaching stage 3. Hepatomegaly (81.5% vs. 55.4%; p = 0.015), splenomegaly (33.3% vs. 10.9%; p = 0.003), dipstick proteinuria (22.2% vs. 5.4%; p = 0.004), and hematuria (29.6% vs. 3.1%; p = <0.001) were more common in those with AKI. In contrast, children with AKI had lower haematocrit (16.9% vs. 22.2%; p = <0.001) and serum bicarbonate (16.7 vs. 19.1 mmoL/L; p = 0.010) compared with those without AKI. Those with AKI had longer hospital stay (median [interquartile range]: 7 [4-12] days vs. 4 [3-6] days; p = 0.008). CONCLUSION: AKI is common among hospitalised children with AKI and is associated with longer hospital stay.

Compared to calcineurin inhibitors, sirolimus has no neurotoxicity or nephrotoxicity, but sirolimus causes dose-dependent thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, delayed wound healing, hyperlipidemia, and hypertriglyceridemia. Here we report a case of acute pancreatitis and diabetic ketoacidosis in a patient with sickle cell disease post haploidentical family donor HSCT which was managed conservatively without plasmapheresis. Based on our review of the literature, this is the first reported case of developing acute pancreatitis as an adverse effect of sirolimus-induced hypertriglyceridemia leading to diabetic ketoacidosis in a recipient of HSCT.
38069073		Drug Selection and Posology, Optimal Therapies and Risk/Benefit Assessment in Medicine: The Paradigm of Iron-Chelating Drugs.The design of clinical protocols and the selection of drugs with appropriate posology are critical parameters for therapeutic outcomes. Optimal therapeutic protocols could ideally be designed in all diseases including for millions of patients affected by excess iron deposition (EID) toxicity based on personalised medicine parameters, as well as many variations and limitations. EID is an adverse prognostic factor for all diseases and especially for millions of chronically red-blood-cell-transfused patients. Differences in iron chelation therapy posology cause disappointing results in neurodegenerative diseases at low doses, but lifesaving outcomes in thalassemia major (TM) when using higher doses. In particular, the transformation of TM from a fatal to a chronic disease has been achieved using effective doses of oral deferiprone (L1), which improved compliance and cleared excess toxic iron from the heart associated with increased mortality in TM. Furthermore, effective L1 and L1/deferoxamine combination posology resulted in the complete elimination of EID and the maintenance of normal iron store levels in TM. The selection of effective chelation protocols has been monitored by MRI T2* diagnosis for EID levels in different organs. Millions of other iron-loaded patients with sickle cell anemia, myelodysplasia and haemopoietic stem cell transplantation, or non-iron-loaded categories with EID in different organs could also benefit from such chelation therapy advances. Drawbacks of chelation therapy include drug toxicity in some patients and also the wide use of suboptimal chelation protocols, resulting in ineffective therapies. Drug metabolic effects, and interactions with other metals, drugs and dietary molecules also affected iron chelation therapy. Drug selection and the identification of effective or optimal dose protocols are essential for positive therapeutic outcomes in the use of chelating drugs in TM and other iron-loaded and non-iron-loaded conditions, as well as general iron toxicity.

It is important to investigate specific complications related to sickle cell disease but also other causes of anemia in general. Transfusions or exchange transfusions are major therapeutic options and are frequently used for acute complications of sickle cell disease but also for primary and secondary prevention of some of the chronic complications. The transfusion strategy has been modified since the awareness of post-transfusion hemolysis by taking into account the transfusion risk score.

The Fertility Preservation Program (FPP) in Pittsburgh cryopreserves testicular tissues for SCD patients prior to BMT in anticipation that those tissues can be thawed in the future and matured to produce sperm. Here, we generated and validated two isogenic patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from testicular biopsy fibroblasts of a 12-year-old SCD patient.
38167227		Successful Conservative Therapy for Infected Penile Implants: A Case Series.BACKGROUND Traditionally, penile implant infections have been treated by removal followed by immediate or delayed replacement. The use of antibiotics in conservative therapy has recently attracted attention. CASE REPORT We report our experience with 4 cases of infected penile implants managed conservatively. Case 1 was a 41-year-old with sickle cell anemia who presented with low-grade fever and purulent discharge that started 1 month postoperatively and lasted for 3 weeks. He had left graft after fibrotic tissue excision with 14-mm collection in the left corpus cavernosum. He was managed with IV pipracillin/tazobactam and vancomycin for 13 days. Follow-up after 23 weeks showed complete wound healing. Case 2 was a 62-year-old with diabetes who had purulent discharge that started 41 days postoperatively and lasted for 1 week. He received 5 days of IV vancomycin and gentamycin. Follow-up after 4 weeks showed marked improvement of the wound. Case 3 was a 61-year-old with diabetes and ischemic heart disease. He presented 30 days postoperatively with fever, purulent discharge for 5 days. He received a total of 10 days of IV vancomycin and gentamycin. Follow-up 3 weeks after discharge showed complete wound healing. Case 4 was a 61-year-old with diabetes and ischemic heart disease. He presented 1 month postoperatively with fever and pus discharge for 1 week. He completed 10 days of IV vancomycin and gentamycin. Follow-up after 1 week showed marked wound healing. CONCLUSIONS Choosing patients with early superficial infected penile prosthesis for conservative management should be tailored to selected patients who does not have leukocytosis, signs of sepsis, high-grade fever, or an exposed device.
38422317		Transfusion of packed red blood cells in adults with sickle cell anemia treated at an emergency hospital.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze the prescription of packed red blood cells performed by emergency physicians for adults with sickle cell anemia. METHODS: Transfusions performed in adults with sickle cell anemia treated at an emergency service in Sao Bernardo do Campo, Sao Paulo Brazil, between January 2018 and January 2022 were evaluated. For data comparison, the chi-square2 test was used. The significance level adopted was 5%. RESULTS: A total of 114 transfusions were performed. The mean age was 41.8+-16.4 years, and pretransfusion hemoglobin was 6.1+-1.23 g/dL. Regarding the indication, the adequacy of transfusions performed in symptomatic individuals was significantly higher compared to asymptomatic individuals (100% vs. 3.9%, p<0.001). Symptomatic individuals received excessive volumes of packed red blood cells less frequently than asymptomatic individuals (17.5% vs. 56.9%, p<0.001). The filtered subtype, indicated for sickle cell anemia, was prescribed in only a quarter of the patients. However, non-indicated subtypes were frequently prescribed. CONCLUSION: This study found low adequacy in the indication and calculation of the transfusion volume of packed red blood cells in asymptomatic individuals. Few patients received filtered red blood cells, resulting in increased risks of transfusion reactions. On the contrary, non-indicated subtypes were prescribed in a quarter of transfusions, which resulted in higher costs and delay in receiving packed red blood cells.
38082534		Hoping for a normal life: Decision-making on hematopoietic stem cell transplantation by patients with a hemoglobinopathy and their caregivers.BACKGROUND: To provide insight into the perspectives of children and young adults with transfusion-dependent thalassemia and sickle cell disease and their caregivers regarding the decision for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). PROCEDURE: A qualitative longitudinal multicenter study. Data collection consisted of 40 audio-recorded conversations between physicians and families and 77 interviews with patients and/or caregivers related to 27 unique cases, collected at different time points throughout the decision-making process. RESULTS: Conversations and interviews revealed "hoping for a normal life" as an overarching theme, consisting of four main topics: (i) "Building a frame of reference" refers to a process where patients or families try to obtain comprehensive information on HSCT and translate this to their situation to decide. (ii) "Balancing between loss and benefit" reports the process of considering the advantages and disadvantages of continuing with supportive care to treat their disease versus choosing HSCT. (iii) "Experiencing the impact of HSCT" describes the impactfull experience of the HSCT period by those who chose HSCT. (iv) "Balancing again" refers to reflecting on the decision made. CONCLUSIONS: The hope for a normal life guided the decision-making process, described as a constant balance between the impact of the disease and HSCT. A structured approach to explore patients' and caregivers' perspectives on HSCT decision-making is needed, where specifically discussing the impact of the disease and hope for a normal life need to be integrated in the process.
38302122	associate|@DISEASE_Hemoglobin_C_Disease|@GENE_HBB	Curative Therapies for Sickle Cell Disease.Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an autosomal recessive hemoglobinopathy that affects individuals worldwide. The mutation in the beta-globin gene leads to abnormal hemoglobin production, sickle hemoglobin, which polymerizes under stress leading to, among other end-organ manifestations, chronic hemolytic anemia, debilitating vaso-occlusive crises, and stroke. Unfortunately, chronic stress on end-organs impacts the life expectancy of patients with SCD, which in the United States averages 43 years, approximately 36 years less than people without the disease. Here, we review the progress made in curative interventions for those with SCD, namely allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation and gene therapy. These interventions continue to evolve as we better understand SCD pathophysiology, use new graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis regimens, expand stem cell donor options, and understand the genetic control of hemoglobin production. Although significant progress has been made, many gaps remain in the successful implementation of these interventions globally and for all patients. [Pediatr Ann. 2024;53(2):e56-e61.].

37965881		Dermatologic complications in pediatric patients after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for sickle cell disease.Dermatologic complications are common following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, but dermatologic complications among pediatric patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for the treatment of sickle cell disease have been poorly characterized. In this case series of 17 patients (<21 years old) with sickle cell disease who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, 16 (94.1%) experienced one or more dermatologic complications after transplant, with the most common complications including acute or chronic mucocutaneous graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (34.1% of complications), skin eruptions of unknown origin (15.9% of complications), infections (15.9% of complications), and chemotherapy-related pigmentary changes (11.4% of complications). Patients who developed acute or chronic skin GVHD were significantly older at the time of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. These findings highlight the need to closely monitor for dermatologic complications in pediatric patients who undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for sickle cell disease and underscore the importance of involving dermatology early on when skin complications occur, although further research with a larger multicenter study could help clarify the risk for dermatologic complications and help identify potential ways to mitigate this risk.
37815822		Altered pain processing and sensitization in sickle cell disease: a scoping review of quantitative sensory testing findings.OBJECTIVES: Over 50% of adults living with sickle cell disease have chronic pain, but the underlying mechanisms of chronic pain in this population remain unclear. Quantitative sensory testing is an important measurement tool for understanding pain and sensory processing. This scoping review summarizes quantitative sensory testing methodologies used in sickle cell studies and the evidence for central sensitization in this population. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL to identify studies using quantitative sensory testing in individuals living with sickle cell disease. Search strategies were based on variations of the terms "sickle cell disease," and "quantitative sensory testing." Eligible studies were observational or experimental studies in human participants living with SCD that reported findings and detailed methodology for at least one quantitative sensory testing modality. RESULTS: Our search yielded a total of 274 records; 27 of which are included in this scoping review. Of the 27 studies, 17 were original studies (with combined total of 516 adult and 298 pediatric participants) and 10 were secondary or subgroup analyses of these prior studies. Significant variation existed in quantitative sensory testing methodologies across studies, including testing locations, type and intensity of stimuli, and interpretation of findings. Of the identified studies, 22% (2/9 studies) reported sensory abnormalities in mechanical sensitivity and thresholds, 22% (2/9 studies) reported abnormal pressure pain thresholds, 46% (6/13 studies) reported sensory abnormalities in thermal pain thresholds and tolerance (cold and warm), and 50% (2/4 studies) reported abnormalities in temporal summation. CONCLUSION: Future studies should use standardized quantitative sensory testing protocols with consistent and operationalized definitions of sensitization to provide clear insight about pain processing and central sensitization in sickle cell disease.

38158354		Two-Dimensional Ultrasound Assessment of Long-Term Intra-Abdominal Organ Changes in Children with Sickle Cell Anemia during Steady State: A Comparative Study.BACKGROUND: Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is a hereditary blood disorder with global prevalence, including in Nigeria. Despite advancements in SCA care management, understanding the long-term impact on organs during steady state has remained inconclusive. AIM: This study aimed to investigate the long-term changes in intra-abdominal organs of SCA children compared with non-SCA children during steady state using two-dimensional ultrasound assessment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 116 children (58 SCA and 58 controls) were enrolled between June 2021 and July 2022. Clinico-demographic data were collected through an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Two-dimensional ultrasound was used to measure the liver, spleen, kidneys, and inferior vena cava in all subjects. Age-matched controls had AA or AS genotypes. RESULTS: Of the 58 patients with SCA, 65.5% were males with an overall mean age of 8.1   3.4 years, while among the non-SCA cohort (n = 58), 48.3% were males with an overall mean age of 8.7   3.9 years. There was no statistically significant difference in the age and gender distribution between the SCA and non-SCA cohorts (P = 0.390 and P = 0.091, respectively). SCA subjects had a larger mean hepatic size than non-SCA subjects (12.09 cm   2.23 vs. 11.67 cm   1.96; P = 0.276) but smaller mean splenic size (8.01 cm   1.89 vs. 8.19 cm   1.61; P = 0.577) and inferior vena cava diameter (1.16 cm   0.29 vs. 1.25 cm   0.33; P = 0.100). Left kidney length and breadth were significantly greater in SCA patients (8.91   1.16 vs. 8.27   1.30; P = 0.006 and 4.15   0.92 vs. 3.79   0.48; P = 0.008, respectively). CONCLUSION: This study highlights the utility of two-dimensional ultrasound assessment in monitoring intra-abdominal organ changes in SCA children, suggesting its cost-effective benefits in monitoring health outcomes in SCA patients.
37976795		Relative anemia and perioperative stroke in children with moyamoya.OBJECTIVES: Surgical revascularization for moyamoya arteriopathy decreases long-term stroke risk but carries a risk of perioperative ischemic complications. We aimed to evaluate modifiable stroke risk factors in children undergoing surgical revascularization for moyamoya. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this exploratory, single-center, retrospective cohort study, medical records of pediatric patients undergoing surgical revascularization for moyamoya arteriopathy at our center between 2003 and 2021 were reviewed. Candidate modifiable risk factors were analyzed for association with perioperative stroke, defined as ischemic stroke <=7 days after surgery. RESULTS: We analyzed 53 surgeries, consisting of 39 individual patients undergoing indirect surgical revascularization of 74 hemispheres. Perioperative ischemic stroke occurred following five surgeries (9.4%). There were no instances of hemorrhagic stroke. Larger pre-to-postoperative decreases in hemoglobin (OR 3.90, p=0.017), hematocrit (OR 1.69, p=0.012) and blood urea nitrogen (OR 1.83, p=0.010) were associated with increased risk of perioperative ischemic stroke. Weight-adjusted intraoperative blood loss was not associated with risk of perioperative ischemic stroke (OR 0.94, p=0.796). Among children with sickle cell disease, all of whom underwent exchange transfusion within one week prior to surgery, none experienced perioperative stroke. CONCLUSIONS: Decreases in hemoglobin, hematocrit, and blood urea nitrogen between the preoperative and postoperative periods are associated with increased risk of perioperative stroke. These novel findings suggest that dilutional anemia, possibly due to standardly administered hyperhydration, may increase the risk of perioperative stroke in some children with moyamoya. Further work optimizing both mean arterial pressure and oxygen-carrying capacity in these patients, including consideration of alternative blood transfusion thresholds, is necessary.
37979134		How We Treat Sickle Cell Disease in Pregnancy.50 years ago, people with sickle cell disease (SCD) were discouraged from becoming pregnant, but now most should be supported if they choose to pursue a pregnancy. They and their providers, however, should be aware of the physiological changes of pregnancy that aggravate SCD and pregnancy's unique maternal and fetal challenges. Any maternal endothelial damage from a poorly perfused placenta has the potential for being superimposed on the endothelial damage of SCD. The immunological and mechanical changes of pregnancy contribute to an increased susceptibility to certain infections. Activation of the complement system and increased neutrophils may contribute to the increase in vaso-occlusive crises during pregnancy. There is an increased demand for red cell mass that is often not achievable without transfusion. Cardiac output increases by 45%. The anatomic and physiologic changes of pregnancy increase the risk of kidney injury. Pregnancy is a hypercoagulable state which confers an increased risk of thrombosis. Maternal problems can arise from chronic underlying organ dysfunction such as renal disease or pulmonary hypertension, from acute complications of SCD such as acute anemia, vaso-occlusive crises and acute chest syndrome, and/or from pregnancy-related complications such as preeclampsia, sepsis, severe anemia, thromboembolism and need for cesarean delivery. Fetal problems include alloimmunization, opioid exposure, fetal growth restriction, preterm delivery, and stillbirth. Prior to and during pregnancy, in addition to the assessment and care that every pregnant patient should receive, patients with SCD should be evaluated and treated by a multidisciplinary team with respect to their unique maternal and fetal issues.
37820110		Implementation of Hospital-Based Sickle Cell Newborn Screening and Follow-Up Programs in Haiti.One in 120 children are born with sickle cell disease (SCD) in Haiti. However, healthcare challenges include isolated newborn screening (NBS) activities and lack of transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) to assess stroke risk. The implementation activities of the "Comparative Study of Children in Haiti and Miami with Sickle Cell Disease (CSHSCD) involved both NBS and TCD implementations in four Haitian clinical sites. We hypothesized that hospital-based SCD NBS and follow-up programs would be feasible in Haiti. Traditional NBS laboratory method with dried blood samples was performed at two Port-au-Prince sites, and the traditional method plus point-of-care (POC) testing was utilized at the two north sites. The rate of clinical follow-up for newborns with SCD as outcome for the NBS intervention was compared to the NBS method. The NBS programs identified SCD in 0.77% of 8,224 newborns over a 24-month period. In the rural hospital assigned to the combination screening, 56% of newborns identified with POC returned for follow-up compared to 0% when POC was not available (p=0.044). Positive newborns and children <6 years of age with SCD at the clinical sites were eligible for study follow-up. Accrual was successful: 165 participants (mean age 42 months, 53% males, 93% SS) were recruited and received oral penicillin. TCD screening was hampered by poor internet and trained staff leaving Haiti, with only one active site conducting screening. Despite challenges, the implementation of NBS and sickle cell programs in Haiti is feasible. We are in the process of understanding how to mitigate implementation limitations.
37833213		Concurrent Cholecystectomy Does Not Increase Splenectomy Morbidity in Patients With Hemolytic Anemia: A Pediatric NSQIP Analysis.PURPOSE: Children undergoing splenectomy for hemolytic anemia often have cholelithiasis, which may or may not be symptomatic. It is unclear whether concurrent cholecystectomy increases length of stay or morbidity after splenectomy. The purpose of this study was to compare morbidity among children undergoing laparoscopic splenectomy alone versus splenectomy with concurrent cholecystectomy in patients with hemolytic anemia. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated children with hemolytic anemia undergoing non-traumatic laparoscopic splenectomy in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program-Pediatric database (2012-2020). Outcomes were compared for patients undergoing splenectomy alone (n = 1010) versus splenectomy with cholecystectomy (n = 371). Pearson's Chi-square and Student's t-tests were utilized as appropriate. Propensity score-matching was completed, controlling for eight demographic and clinical variables. RESULTS: 1381 patients were identified, 73.1% undergoing splenectomy alone and 26.9% splenectomy with cholecystectomy. Splenectomy with cholecystectomy patients were older (10.9 years vs. 8.4 years, p < 0.01), more likely to have hereditary spherocytosis (56.1% vs. 40.8%, p < 0.01), less likely to have sickle cell disease (12.1% vs. 33.5%, p < 0.01), more likely ASA class 1 or 2 (49.3% vs. 42.1%, p < 0.01), and had similar preoperative hematocrit levels (29.6 vs. 29.3, p = 0.33). The splenectomy with cholecystectomy group was less likely to receive preoperative blood transfusions (13.5% vs. 25.4%, p < 0.01). There were 360 pairs selected on propensity score-matching, and splenectomy with cholecystectomy was associated with increased operative time (182 min vs. 145 min, p < 0.01) and decreased occurrences of a postoperative transfusion (4.2% vs. 8.9%, p = 0.01). Length of stay after surgery (2.5 days vs. 2.3 days, p = 0.13), composite morbidity (3.9% vs. 3.4%, p = 0.69), and 30-day readmission rates (3.3% vs. 7.4%, p = 0.08) were all similar. CONCLUSIONS: Splenectomy with cholecystectomy is associated with similar postoperative morbidity, length of stay and readmission rates compared to splenectomy alone. These data support the safety of concurrent cholecystectomy with splenectomy for children with cholelithiasis in the setting of hemolytic anemia. TYPE OF STUDY: Retrospective Cohort Study. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III.

38015105		Intravenous fluid therapy and hospital outcomes for vaso-occlusive episodes in children, adolescents, and young adults with sickle cell disease.BACKGROUND: While intravenous fluid (IVF) therapy in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) admitted for a vaso-occlusive episode (VOE) can help reduce red blood cell sickling, clinical practice varies across institutions. We examined the relationship between IVF therapy and hospital length of stay (HLOS), as well as adverse events, such as acute chest syndrome (ACS), pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) transfer, and 28-day re-admission. METHODS: This is a single-center retrospective analysis of SCD VOE hospitalizations between January 2015 and April 2020. Patients with SCD, age 0-30, with consecutive hospitalizations for VOE were included. For the first 3 days of each admission, an "IVF ratio" was calculated by dividing actual IVF rate administered by weight-based maintenance IVF (mIVF) rate. RESULTS: A total of 617 hospitalizations for 161 patients were included. Mean HLOS was 5.7 days, (SD 3.9), and mean IVF volume over the first 3 days of admission was 139.6 mL/kg/day (SD 57.8). Multivariate analysis showed that for each additional 0.5 times the mIVF rate, HLOS increased by 0.53 day (p < .001; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.609-0.989), but there was no significant association between IVF therapy and adverse events. History of chronic pain was associated with increased odds of re-admission (OR 6.4; 95% CI: 3.93-10.52). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the theoretical potential for IVF therapy to slow down the sickling process, our findings suggest that increased IVF therapy was associated with prolonged HLOS, which places a burden on patients, families, and the health system.
37863704		Debate: Should the loss of disability adjusted life years (DALY) define the focus of Global Hematology?: The case for prioritizing capacity building in anemia management and blood transfusion.Setting priorities in healthcare is always contentious given the array of possible services at primary, secondary, and tertiary levels of care, not to mention potential public health interventions. The central goals in global policy have been reducing inequity within and between countries, protecting vulnerable groups (particularly women and children) and reducing the major communicable diseases which have historically been a major burden in lower- and middle-income countries. Here limited relative and absolute spending on healthcare have spurred a series of initiatives in Global Health over the last 50 years which have led to significant gains in measures of morbidity and mortality. Against this background there remains the continuing question of how to adapt current medical practice in higher income countries for training and planning of services in lower- and middle-income countries. Here, the historical development of Global Health is outlined, and lessons drawn from the surveys of the global burden of disease and health economic analysis to understand how we can apply these principles to define Global Hematology. It remains likely that in lower-income countries effort should be concentrated on developing laboratory services and blood transfusion, to allow safe and effective support for the assessment of treatment of anemia, sickle cell disease, maternal and child health and urgent surgery and obstetric services. However, the principles of Global Health, could also be used for hematological malignancies to develop a framework for Global Hematology for all settings.
37883803		Cerebral hemodynamic changes after haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplant in adults with sickle cell disease.Preliminary evidence from four adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) suggests that hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) improves cerebral hemodynamics. HSCT largely normalizes cerebral hemodynamics in children with SCD. We tested the hypothesis in adults with SCD that cerebral blood flow (CBF), oxygen extraction fraction (OEF), and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) measured using MRI, normalized to healthy values, comparing measurements approximately one month before to 12-24 months following HSCT (n=11; age=33.3+-8.9 years; 389+-150 days post-HSCT) to age-, race- and sex-matched values from healthy adults without sickle trait (n=28; age=30.2+-5.6 years). Prior to transplant, 7 patients had neurological indications for transplant (e.g., overt stroke) and 4 had non-neurological reasons for haploidentical bone marrow transplant (haploBMT). All received haploBMT from first-degree relatives (parent, sibling, or child donor) with reduced-intensity preparation and maintained engraftment. Pre-transplant, CBF was elevated (CBF=69.11 24.7 ml/100g/min) compared to controls (p = 0.004). Mean CBF declined significantly following haploBMT (post-transplant CBF=48.2+-13.9 ml/100g/min, p=0.003). OEF was not different from controls at baseline and did not change significantly following HaploBMT (pre-transplant: 43.1 6.7%; post-transplant: 39.6 7.0%, p=0.34). Post-transplant, CBF and OEF were not significantly different from controls (CBF=48.2 13.4 ml/100g/min; p=0.78, and OEF=39.6 7.0%; p>0.99). CMRO2 did not change significantly following haploBMT (pre-transplant=3.18 0.87 ml O2/100g/min; post-transplant: 2.95 0.83; p=0.56). Major complications of haploBMT included one infection-related death and one severe chronic graft versus host disease. HaploBMT in adults with SCD reduces CBF to control values and maintains OEF and CMRO2 on average at levels observed in healthy adult controls.
38265872		Sexual Maturation of Female Adolescent Patients with Sickle Cell Anaemia in Lagos, Nigeria.BACKGROUND: Sickle cell anaemia (SCA) has been shown to have adverse effects on growth and sexual development. Recent Nigerian studies have reported a declining trend in the age of sexual maturation and menarche in haemoglobin AA (HbAA) individuals. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the sexual maturation of female patients with SCA aged 10 to 19 years seen at Lagos University Teaching Hospital Idi-Araba, Lagos and Sickle Cell Foundation. METHODS: It was a cross-sectional study involving 140 girls with SCA (subjects) and an equal number of girls with HbAA (controls) who were matched for age and socio-economic class over a fivemonth period. The evaluation involved anthropometry, calculation of BMI and determination of breast and pubic hair development using Tanner staging. RESULTS: The mean BMI for the subjects was 17.2+-2.39 kg/m2and 20.2+-3.09 kg/m2 for the controls (p < 0.001). The mean age at onset of breast development (B2) was 13 +- 0.39 years in the subjects and 10.5 +- 0.51 years in the controls (p < 0.001). The corresponding mean age for pubic hair development (PH2) was also higher at 13.8 +- 0.59 years for the girls with SCA and 10.4 +- 0.51 years for the controls (p <0.001), while menarche was achieved in the subjects at 14.7 +- 1.68 years and in the controls at 12.3 +- 1.33 years (p < 0.001). Upper socioeconomic class was associated with earlier menarche and faster transition from pre-pubertal stage to pubertal stage of sexual maturation in the controls but was not observed in the SCA subjects. CONCLUSION: Sexual maturity in patients with SCA lagged behind those of the HbAA controls.
38138299		Pain Control for Sickle Cell Crisis, a Novel Approach? A Retrospective Study.Background and Objectives: Pain management poses a significant challenge for patients experiencing vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) in sickle cell disease (SCD). While opioid therapy is highly effective, its efficacy can be impeded by undesirable side effects. Local regional anesthesia (LRA), involving the deposition of a perineural anesthetic, provides a nociceptive blockade, local vasodilation and reduces the inflammatory response. However, the effectiveness of this therapeutic approach for VOC in SCD patients has been rarely reported up to now. The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a single-shot local regional anesthesia (LRA) in reducing pain and consequently enhancing the management of severe vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) in adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) unresponsive to conventional analgesic therapy. Materials and Methods: We first collected consecutive episodes of VOC in critical care (ICU and emergency room) for six months in 2022 in a French University hospital with a large population of sickle cell patients in the West Indies population. We also performed a systematic review of the use of LRA in SCD. The primary outcome was defined using a numeric pain score (NPS) and/or percentage of change in opioid use. Results: We enrolled nine SCD adults (28 years old, 4 females) for ten episodes of VOC in whom LRA was used for pain management. Opioid reduction within the first 24 h post block was -75% (50 to 96%). Similarly, the NPS decreased from 9/10 pre-block to 0-1/10 post-block. Five studies, including one case series with three patients and four case reports, employed peripheral nerve blocks for regional anesthesia. In general, local regional anesthesia (LRA) exhibited a reduction in pain and symptoms, along with a decrease in opioid consumption post-procedure. Conclusions: LRA improves pain scores, reduces opioid consumption in SCD patients with refractory pain, and may mitigate opioid-related side effects while facilitating the transition to oral analgesics. Furthermore, LRA is a safe and effective procedure.

This study aims to evaluate the clinical and epidemiological features and therapeutic options of AVN in sickle cell patients in Qatar. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on a 49 SCD patients who were diagnosed with AVN and attended the hematology clinic at the National Center for Cancer care & research, Hamad Medical Corporation, Qatar between Jan-2011 to Jan2021.  Results: Forty-nine adult patients with SCD who were diagnosed with AVN were studied. The median age of the study population is 32 years, and the median age at the first AVN diagnosis was 26 years (range: 11-44 yr.). 37 (75.5%) patients suffered from multiple joints AVN while 12(24.5%) had single joint involvement. 31 (63.3%) patients had bilateral hip AVN and 18 (36.7%) had shoulder involvement. 30 patients (61%) were on Hydroxyurea treatment. Based on FICAT and Alert classification of AVN, 57 % of patients had stage III and above at first diagnosis. 20 (40.8%) were managed with a conservative approach, 11 (22.4%) received hyperbaric oxygen with good response, 6(12.2%) underwent hip core decompression and 12(24.5%) underwent hip replacement surgery. CONCLUSION: In SCD patients, AVN occurred more during the 3rd and 4th decades of life. The majority of AVN represented with advanced stage and had multiple joint involvements. We recommend adopting a low threshold of joint imaging for early detection and prevention of further complications.

Because this alkylating agent is increasingly utilized as conditioning prior to gene therapy in nonmalignant hematologic and related disorders, more precise characterization of busulfan's potential contribution to subsequent malignant risk is warranted. PROCEDURE: We conducted a literature-based assessment of busulfan and subsequent late effects, with emphasis on secondary malignancies, identifying publications via PubMed searches, and selecting those reporting at least 3 years of follow-up. RESULTS: We identified eight pediatric and 13 adult publications describing long-term follow-up in 570 pediatric and 2076 adult hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients. Secondary malignancies were reported in 0.5% of pediatric HCT recipients, with no cases of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myelocytic leukemia (AML). Fatal secondary malignancies were reported in 0.8% of 1887 evaluable adult HCT recipients, and an overall incidence of secondary malignancies of 4.8% was reported in a subset of 389 evaluable adult patients. We also reviewed long-term results from eight publications evaluating lentiviral- and human promotor-based HSC-targeted gene therapy in 215 patients with nonmalignant conditions, in which busulfan/treosulfan monotherapy or busulfan/fludarabine was the only conditioning. Two malignancies were reported in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), one of which was potentially busulfan-related. No additional malignancies were reported in 173 patients with follow-up of 5-12 years. CONCLUSION: The incidence of busulfan-related secondary malignancies is low, and likely to be substantially less than 1% in pediatric transplant recipients, especially those receiving busulfan monotherapy for nonmalignant conditions other than SCD.

38000628		Gene-addition/editing therapy in sickle cell disease.Gene therapy is an innovative strategy that offers potential cure for patients with sickle cell disease, and no appropriate donor for transplant consideration. While we await long term data from these clinical trials, we remain optimistic that gene therapy will become a standard of care for curative treatment in sickle cell disease. As gene therapy becomes a standard of treatment in sickle cell disease, we must also acknowledge the potential for financial burden to patients. We also must acknowledge the prevalence of sickle cell disease in low-resource settings. Hopefully, as we learn more about gene therapy, we can assess ways to overcome the financial toxicity that comes with this therapy.

38069526		Euvolemic automated transfusion to treat severe anemia in sickle cell disease patients at risk of circulatory overload.BACKGROUND: Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion remains a major treatment for sickle cell disease (SCD). Patients with SCD have a high prevalence of renal impairment and cardiorespiratory disease, conferring risk of transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We describe an approach, titled euvolemic automated transfusion (EAT), to transfuse SCD patients with severe anemia who are at risk of TACO. In EAT, plasmapheresis is performed using donor RBCs, rather than albumin or plasma, as replacement fluid. Euvolemia is maintained. A retrospective analysis was conducted of patients with SCD who underwent EAT at our institution over a 10-year period, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of EAT. RESULTS: Eleven SCD patients underwent 109 EAT procedures (1-59 procedures per patient). The median age was 42 years (IQR = [30-49]) and 82% (n = 9) were female. Most (82%; n = 9) patients had severe chronic kidney disease and 55% (n = 6) had heart failure. One (9%) patient had a history of life-threatening TACO. Mean pre- and post-procedure Hct values were 19.8% (SD   1.6%) and 29.1% (SD   1.4%), respectively. The average Hct increment was 3.2% per RBC unit. Only two EAT-related complications were recorded during the 109 procedures: central line-associated infection and citrate toxicity (muscle cramping). EAT used an average of two RBC units less than that projected for standard automated RBC exchange. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that EAT is safe and effective to treat patients with SCD and severe anemia, who are at risk for TACO. EAT requires fewer RBC units compared to automated RBC exchange.
38066846		Logistics, risks, and benefits of automated red blood cell exchange for patients with sickle cell disease.Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions treat and prevent severe complications of sickle cell disease (SCD) and can be delivered as a simple or exchange transfusion. During an exchange, some of the patient's abnormal hemoglobin (Hb) S (HbS) RBCs are removed. An apheresis device can accomplish an automated RBC exchange, simultaneously removing patient's RBCs while returning other blood components along with normal RBCs. Automated RBC exchange is therefore an isovolemic transfusion that can efficiently decrease HbS RBCs while limiting iron loading and hyperviscosity. However, specialized equipment, trained personnel, appropriate vascular access, and increased RBC exposure are required compared to simple or manual RBC exchange. Therefore, risks and benefits must be balanced to make individualized decisions for patients with SCD who require transfusion.
