The declining number of units collected exposes blood providers to a rapidly evolving supply challenge. METHODS: This study was conducted retrospectively with use of internal data analysis to weigh Quebec's situation regarding global and antigen-negative RBC demand, to measure the effects of community-directed recruitment and blood drives, and to evaluate the benefits of mass-scale RBC genotyping. RESULTS: Our findings confirm a global RBC usage downtrend of over 20% total in the past 10 years with a steady antigen-negative usage and highlight the most requested negative antigen combinations. Our data also show our +39.5% progress regarding the number of Black donors recruited for antigen matching of patients with sickle cell disease in the past 3 years, as well as a constantly growing number of just-in-time blood collection for complex orders. Finally, our data summarize the efficiency of our mass-scale RBC genotyping efforts. CONCLUSION: Altogether, this study confirms the demand trends for regular and antigen-negative RBC units in Quebec and the efficient effects of our recruitment and typing strategies.",
