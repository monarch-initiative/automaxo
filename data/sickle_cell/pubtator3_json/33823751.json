            "text": "Twenty million people live with a sickle cell disease (SCD) diagnosis globally; about 100,000 reside in the United States of America (US). Although SCD continues to threaten the health, mostly of particular groups in the US, there is a lack of knowledge on risk factors such as unawareness of carrier status, inheritance patterns, and resistance to SCT screening among childbearing age individuals. A cross-sectional survey design using a modified version of the Health Belief Survey assessed college students' SCD beliefs and screening behaviors. Four hundred sixteen students from a North Texas university campus participated in the survey. Although most participants believed that knowing their carrier status was important, only 26% were aware of their status. Findings demonstrated that health beliefs were a significant predictor of screening behaviors. The Universal, Selective, and Indicated Prevention Approach was suggested as a suitable approach to educate, transform health beliefs, and augment screening participation.",
