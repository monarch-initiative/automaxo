It is undesirable because the donations cannot be used and there may be an underlying medical cause. Based on regional approaches, a uniform procedure was developed. METHODS: Information about whole blood, plasma- plateletpheresis donations from which one or more components were rejected for filtration time (>2 h), hemolysis or clots were extracted from blood bank information system. After rejection of two successive components or donations or total >=3 the donor is contacted. Depending on the medical history and investigation by the family doctor, the donor carrier is re-evaluated. We looked for the causes of the discarded products and performed a survey among blood services regarding polices with discarded products. RESULTS: One or more components from 1742 of about 2.2 million successful donations (0.08%) were rejected. The highest percentage of rejection was seen in plateletpheresis (1.5%), all for clots. No underlying medical causes were found. 24 whole blood donors were found to have sickle cell trait (SCT) and were permanently deferred. The policies for follow-up after discarded products or acceptance of SCT donors vary between the 16 blood banks. Six organizations do not follow-up donors and seven accept SCT for blood or plasma donation. CONCLUSION: Informing donors with repeated discarded products avoids the non-use of donations. Causes of repeated discarded products can be found by follow-up of donors. The results of the survey indicate a large discrepancy in policies applied worldwide.",
