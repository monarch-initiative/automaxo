An analysis of the existing literature shows a limited number of publications that address this issue and specifically compare clinical outcomes in this population based on a treatment strategy of prophylactic transfusion versus transfusion only for clinical indications (on-demand transfusion). The existing studies show a wide variation in study design and outcomes measured. The results of this analysis suggest that there are insufficient data to support a clinically significant difference in morbidity and mortality outcomes based on transfusion strategy. Additional prospective clinical studies need to be performed to adequately address the risks and benefits of prophylactic transfusion and guide clinical decision making.",
