African American donor ethnicity is one of 10 risk factors in calculating the kidney donor profile index used in assessing organ quality. We aimed to evaluate outcomes of deceased-donor kidney transplants from African American donors stratified by kidney donor profile index. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using the Organ Procurement and Transplant Network/United Network for Organ Sharing database, we identified deceased-donor kidney transplant recipients from 2000 to 2015 who received induction and calcineurin inhibitor/mycophenolic acid maintenance. Patients were divided into 4 kidney donor profile index groups (0%-20%, 21%-50%, 51%-85%, and > 85%). Long-term outcomes of each group were compared between African American and non-African American kidney donations using Cox model. RESULTS: Among 59 648 patients, 15 250 were in the 0% to 20% group (560 African American donors, 14 690 non-African American donors), 19 355 were in the 21% to 50% group (2807 African American donors, 16 548 non-African American donors), 19 412 were in the 51% to 85% group (2774 African American donors, 16 638 non-African American donors), and 5631 were in the > 85% group (1670 African American donors, 3961 non-African American donors). Adjusted overall and death-censored graft failure risks were higher for recipients of African American donor kidneys in the 51% to 85% (hazard ratio 1.12; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.25; P = .009 and hazard ratio 1.12; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.25; P = .03) and the > 85% kidney donor profile index (hazard ratio 1.12; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.24; P = .025 and hazard ratio 1.33; 95% confidence interval, 1.16-1.51; P < .001) groups. CONCLUSIONS: Inferior graft outcomes in recipients of African American kidneys in our study were limited to those with > 50% kidney donor profile index. Effects of risk factors such as APOL1 risk alleles and sickle cell trait on these observations need further study.",
