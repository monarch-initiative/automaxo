BACKGROUND: A stem cell transplant has a high likelihood of improving symptoms of sickle cell disease in adults. While studies have reported the transplant experiences of recipients and donors with haematological malignancies, no published reports have examined the experience of both adult recipients with sickle cell disease and their donors. DESIGN: Exploratory qualitative descriptive analysis. METHODS: We conducted individual interviews with 13 recipients and donors (eight males, five females) representing five recipient-donor dyads and one recipient-donor triad from one Midwest transplant centre between August 2017-February 2018. Interviews were digitally audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using conventional content analysis. FINDINGS: Five themes were identified: the downward spiral and a second chance; getting the monster off my back; difficult and manageable; it was worth it; and relating to the healthcare team. CONCLUSIONS: The results provide a description and insights into the complex nature of the stem cell transplant experience in sickle cell disease from the perspectives of both recipients and donors. IMPACT: Health provider awareness of recipient-donor experiences can contribute to family-centred care that supports the health and quality of life for both recipients and donors. This understanding promotes high quality clinical care and improved communications by taking into account the knowledge, values and informed preferences of recipients and donors and contributes to improved decision-making and clinical care. Future research can assess family experiences that support informed choice for potential transplant candidates.",
