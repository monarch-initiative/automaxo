            "text": "OBJECTIVES: National guidelines recommend that children with sickle cell anemia receive annual transcranial Doppler (TCD) screening to assess stroke risk. Our objectives were to estimate the rate of TCD screening among privately insured children with sickle cell anemia, estimate out-of-pocket spending for TCD screening, and evaluate the association between TCD screening and enrollment in high-deductible health plans (HDHPs). STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional. METHODS: Using the 2009-2017 IBM MarketScan Commercial Database, we identified children aged 2 to 15 years who met a validated claims-based definition of sickle cell anemia. We calculated the proportion of children receiving annual TCD screening and out-of-pocket spending per TCD screen. Using logistic regression with generalized estimating equations, we modeled the receipt of annual TCD screening as a function of HDHP enrollment, controlling for demographics and year. RESULTS: The 2519 children in the analysis accounted for 7197 person-years of enrollment; 14% of person-years were from HDHP enrollees. During 2009-2017, the proportion of children receiving TCD screening ranged from 40% to 44%. Median out-of-pocket spending for TCD screening was $20 overall and $65 among HDHP enrollees. Out-of-pocket spending exceeded $100 for 27% of all screens and 42% of screens among HDHP enrollees. HDHP enrollment was not associated with TCD screening (adjusted odds ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.85-1.15). CONCLUSIONS: Among privately insured children with sickle cell anemia, fewer than half received annual TCD screening. Out-of-pocket spending exceeded $100 for 27% of TCD screens. Although HDHP enrollment was not associated with TCD screening, additional studies are needed to assess whether cost sharing might deter this screening.",
