CRISPR-based technologies have promise as a therapeutic platform for many human genetic diseases previously considered untreatable, providing a flexible approach to high-fidelity gene editing. For many diseases, such as sickle-cell disease and beta thalassemia, curative therapy may already be on the horizon, with CRISPR-based clinical trials slated for the next few years. Translation of CRISPR-based therapy to in vivo application however, is no small feat, and major hurdles remain for efficacious use of the CRISPR/Cas9 system in clinical contexts. AREAS COVERED: In this topical review, we highlight recent advances to in vivo delivery of the CRISPR/Cas9 system using various packaging formats, including viral, mRNA, plasmid, and protein-based approaches. We also discuss some of the barriers which have yet to be overcome for successful translation of this technology. EXPERT OPINION: This review focuses on the challenges to efficacy for various delivery formats, with specific emphasis on overcoming these challenges through the development of carrier vehicles for transient approaches to CRISPR/Cas9 delivery in vivo.",
