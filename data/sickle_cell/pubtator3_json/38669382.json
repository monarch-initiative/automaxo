Managing diabetes in individuals with SCA requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique physiological and pathological aspects of both diseases. This paper reviews the challenges encountered in the management of DM in patients with SCA and explores therapeutic strategies and approaches to optimize patient care. Challenges in the management of DM in individuals with SCA stem from several factors, including the impact of hemoglobin variants on glycemic control assessment, increased susceptibility to infections, altered immune response, and complications associated with both diseases. Moreover, the coexistence of SCA and DM heightens the susceptibility to infections due to compromised immune function, emphasizing the need for vigilant preventive measures, including vaccinations and close monitoring for infectious complications. Close collaboration among healthcare providers specializing in diabetes, hematology, and other relevant fields is crucial for developing comprehensive care plans. Individualized treatment strategies that balance glycemic control, pain management, and preventive care are essential to mitigate complications and optimize the overall health outcomes of patients with both DM and SCA. In conclusion, managing diabetes in the context of SCA necessitates a nuanced and patient-centered approach. By addressing the challenges and employing tailored therapeutic strategies, healthcare providers can improve the quality of life and health outcomes for individuals affected by both conditions.",
