            "text": "INTRODUCTION: Prospective blood donors are routinely screened for blood borne infections but medical illnesses and haemoglobin genotype are overlooked despite a high prevalence of haemoglobin AS among Nigerian donors. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of haemoglobin AS and its association to renal function, if any. METHOD: Apparently healthy donors were studied between February and December 2018. Their haemoglobin genotype and, estimated glomerular filtration rates were determined. RESULTS: There were 96 males (94.1%) and 6 (5.9%) females with mean age of 26.7+-4.5 years (range 19-44 years) and mean eGFR of 103.97+-19.00ml/min/1.73m2. Eighty one (79.4%) and 21 (20.6%) subjects had haemoglobin AA and AS genotypes respectively. The mean eGFR for subjects with haemoglobin AA and AS were 105.2+-18.6ml/min/1.73m2 and 99.9 +- 21.2ml/min/1.73m2 respectively (p value = 0.270). Eighty one (79.4%), 20 (19.6%) and 1 (1.0%) subjects had renal function at >90ml/min/1.73m2, 60-89ml/min/1.73m2 and 30-59ml/min/m2 respectively. There was no significant difference in the mean eGFR between subjects with haemoglobin AA and AS (mean difference 5.3, p = 0.265, 95%CI = -4.07 to 14.60). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of sickle cell trait among Nigerian blood donors is high. There is no significant difference in the renal function status of blood donors with SCT and normal haemoglobin genotype.",
