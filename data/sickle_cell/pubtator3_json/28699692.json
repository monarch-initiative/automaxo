Outcomes of Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) administration are obscure for hemoglobin S trait donors. This study aims at investigating the incidence of hemoglobin S carrier status and outcomes of G-CSF administration among donors who live in Eastern Mediterranean region. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The cross-sectional, single-center cohort study was performed with 147 donors between January 2013 and March 2017. Prevalence of hemoglobin S trait was estimated and subjects with or without Hemogobin S trait were compared with regard to stem cell characteristics, early and late clinical outcomes after G-CSF administration. RESULTS: Eleven out of 147 donors (7.48%) were found as hemoglobin S trait. G-CSF administration was successfully completed and yielded good harvesting results in hemoglobin S trait donors. No statistically significant difference was found between groups with regard to early and late side effects, stem cell characteristics. Blood pressures and QTc values were within normal ranges in both groups. Groups were similar with regard to CD34 values. CONCLUSION: G-CSF seems safe in hemoglobin S trait donors. Their being eligible as donors would increase the chance of the patients for allogeneic stem cell transplantation in high prevalence regions. Further studies are required to reveal the safety profile of G-SCF in hemoglobin S carriers in different regions.",
