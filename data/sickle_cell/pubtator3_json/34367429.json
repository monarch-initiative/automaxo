            "text": "INTRODUCTION: sickle cell disease is one of the greatest public health problems of this age. This study was conducted to assess the knowledge, attitude and control practices on sickle cell disease (SCD) among selected secondary school students in Osun State, Nigeria. METHODS: a descriptive cross-sectional study involved 420 secondary school students within Osogbo Metropolis selected by a multistage stratified sampling technique, using self-administered structured questionnaire. Data were collected using pre-tested self-administered semi structured questionnaire. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 20. RESULTS: a total of 420 students were interviewed, modal age range 15-20 years. There were more females (55%) than males (45%). Majority of them were christians (57.1%). A larger percentage of the respondents were aware of SCD (58.5%). However, comprehensive knowledge as regards the various genotypes related to SCD, tests to be done for genotype screening among the respondents is low. One third of the respondents had positive attitude towards SCD (65%) and nearly one half (48%) of the respondents had bad control practices. CONCLUSION: findings in this study shows a high level of general awareness on SCD, even though comprehensive knowledge as regards the various genotype related to SCD, tests to be done for genotype screening among others is low. The need to improve on their attitude and practice towards the disease is highly recommended because having a good knowledge is not as important as applying the knowledge in a way to stop the spread of the disease.",
