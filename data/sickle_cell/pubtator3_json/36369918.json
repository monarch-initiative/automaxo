            "text": "The National Premarital Screening Program, which includes sickle cell disease and thalassemia, was made mandatory in 2004 by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), and the earlier studies have shown a poor knowledge and negative attitude toward this program in the different study groups. This study was conducted to assess the knowledge and attitudes toward premarital screening (PMS) in a randomly selected national sample of the Saudi population, 18 years and above. This was a cross-sectional study conducted in the Saudi population in the western region between July and December 2021. Valid and reliable questionnaire and data were collected from 893 participants aged >=18 years. The chi2 test was used to ascertain if there is an association between categorical variables. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine factors predicting satisfactory knowledge. All 893 study participants had heard about PMS with 625 (70.0%), 244 (27.3%) and 24 (2.7%) having satisfactory, fair and poor knowledge, respectively. Participants aged 26-35 years (p =0 .038), females (p < 0.001), those with higher education (p = 0.003) and employed (p = 0.004), had a better knowledge compared to other groups. Most of the participants had a positive attitude toward PMS. There is a changing trend in the knowledge and attitude toward PMS with a greater number of people wanting to go for PMS. There is also an improvement in the number of participants opting out of marriage in case of incompatibility with their future partner. However, the health education programs need to be improved regarding the hemoglobinopathies.",
