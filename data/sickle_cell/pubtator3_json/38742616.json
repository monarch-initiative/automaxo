Its complexity and training deficits in healthcare providers result in many patients receiving ineffective care. Large health inequities also exist in access to effective pain care for vulnerable populations. The traumatic history of indigenous people and people of color in regards to the experience of pain care perpetuates a lack of trust in the healthcare system, causing many to hesitate to seek medical treatment for painful events and conditions. Other vulnerable populations include those with sickle cell disease or fibromyalgia, whose experience of pain has not been well-understood. There are both barriers to care and stigma for patients with pain, including those taking prescribed doses of long-term opioids, those with known substance use disorder, and those with mental health diagnoses. The suffering of patients with pain can be \"invisible\" to the clinician, and to one's community at large. Pain can affect all people; but those most vulnerable to not getting effective care may continue to suffer in silence because their voices are not heard. Since 1973, pain societies around the globe have worked tirelessly to bring clinicians together to advance pain and opioid education, research, and patient care. These improvements consist of pain education, integrative treatment, and the understanding that a therapeutic alliance is critical to effective pain management. Pain education for both pre and post-licensure health professionals has increased substantially over the last decade. In addition, integrative and interdisciplinary approaches for clinical pain management are now considered best practices in pain care for patients with moderate to severe pain in addition to the development of a strong therapeutic alliance.",
