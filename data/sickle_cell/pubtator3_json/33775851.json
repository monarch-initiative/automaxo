They might be the natural part of bacterial genomes for providing protection against viruses like bacteriophages but science has successfully achieved their use in the benefit of man-kind by using them for the treatment of deadly diseases like cancer, AIDS or genetic disorders like sickle cell disease and Leber congenital amaurosis. CRISPR system is majorly divided into two classes i.e class I and class II, of which the class II CRISPR/Cas9 system performs site specific cleavage of DNA with a guide RNA Cas12 (Cpf1). With the new emerging discoveries it is being found that CRISPR not only works on double stranded DNA but can also be useful to induce any sort of site specific cleavage in RNA too by Cas13 earlier known as C2c2, which is a protein found in CRISPR system and has ability to cure viral infections in plants. CRISPR is being used in the field of gene manipulation and various animals models are available to serve this purpose with short lifespan, rapid reproducibility and lower maintenance cost. Many successful studies and experiments performed using CRISPR, reveals their potency and utility to bring revolution in the areas which were previously believed to be out of scope of science and medicine.",
