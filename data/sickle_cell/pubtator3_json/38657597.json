Besides care of those chronically sick patients, transition process is a vulnerable phase which highly influences further treatment. To make matters worse, patients often have migration background with subsequent communication problems. A national guidance for a standardized transition process is lacking in Germany. In context of a structured consensus process, the \"transition initiative sickle cell disease\" developed specific recommendations for a structured transition of sickle cell patients on the basis of the S3 transition guideline of the DGfTM. These recommendations should improve this vulnerable process in this complex disease to ensure adequate further treatment and to avoid acute and chronic complications but also mental, social or job-related issues. Besides improvement of quality of life, medical treatment and survival, health economic aspects arise. Documents were developed to support and facilitate the transition process and are available under www.sichelzellkrankheit.info/transition/.",
