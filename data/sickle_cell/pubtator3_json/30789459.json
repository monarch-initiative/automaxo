Despite the high morbidity and mortality of this disease, hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), a curative treatment for SCD, remains underutilized. In the literature there is a paucity of data concerning medical decision maker (MDM) awareness of HCT as a treatment option for SCD. The objective of this study was to estimate the proportion of parents/guardians of children with SCD who are aware of HCT as a treatment option, and to identify the demographic factors associated with knowledge of this therapy's curative potential. Between November 2015 and December 2016, 327 parents/guardians were surveyed across 4 clinical sites in 3 Midwestern US cities. Although 82% of parents/guardians had heard of HCT in the past and 78% were aware of the therapy's curative potential, nearly half indicated that they did not know whether HCT could specifically cure their child of the disease. Respondents who had discussed HCT with their child's physician had 5 times higher odds of being aware of HCT's curative potential than those who had not. These findings suggest that additional efforts to enhance MDM knowledge of HCT as well as shared decision making in the use of this therapy, is warranted.",
