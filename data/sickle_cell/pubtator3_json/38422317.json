METHODS: Transfusions performed in adults with sickle cell anemia treated at an emergency service in Sao Bernardo do Campo, Sao Paulo Brazil, between January 2018 and January 2022 were evaluated. For data comparison, the chi-square2 test was used. The significance level adopted was 5%. RESULTS: A total of 114 transfusions were performed. The mean age was 41.8+-16.4 years, and pretransfusion hemoglobin was 6.1+-1.23 g/dL. Regarding the indication, the adequacy of transfusions performed in symptomatic individuals was significantly higher compared to asymptomatic individuals (100% vs. 3.9%, p<0.001). Symptomatic individuals received excessive volumes of packed red blood cells less frequently than asymptomatic individuals (17.5% vs. 56.9%, p<0.001). The filtered subtype, indicated for sickle cell anemia, was prescribed in only a quarter of the patients. However, non-indicated subtypes were frequently prescribed. CONCLUSION: This study found low adequacy in the indication and calculation of the transfusion volume of packed red blood cells in asymptomatic individuals. Few patients received filtered red blood cells, resulting in increased risks of transfusion reactions. On the contrary, non-indicated subtypes were prescribed in a quarter of transfusions, which resulted in higher costs and delay in receiving packed red blood cells.",
