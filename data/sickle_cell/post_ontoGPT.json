Here, we used whole-genome sequencing to track hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from six patients with SCD at pre- and post-GT time points to map the somatic mutation and clonal landscape of gene-modified and unmodified HSCs. Pre-GT, phylogenetic trees were highly polyclonal and mutation burdens per cell were elevated in some, but not all, patients. Post-GT, no clonal expansions were identified among gene-modified or unmodified cells; however, an increased frequency of potential driver mutations associated with myeloid neoplasms or clonal hematopoiesis (DNMT3A- and EZH2-mutated clones in particular) was observed in both genetically modified and unmodified cells, suggesting positive selection of mutant clones during GT. This work sheds light on HSC clonal dynamics and the mutational landscape after GT in SCD, highlighting the enhanced fitness of some HSCs harboring pre-existing driver mutations. Future studies should define the long-term fate of mutant clones, including any contribution to expansions associated with myeloid neoplasms.",

PROCEDURE: A qualitative longitudinal multicenter study. Data collection consisted of 40 audio-recorded conversations between physicians and families and 77 interviews with patients and/or caregivers related to 27 unique cases, collected at different time points throughout the decision-making process. RESULTS: Conversations and interviews revealed \"hoping for a normal life\" as an overarching theme, consisting of four main topics: (i) \"Building a frame of reference\" refers to a process where patients or families try to obtain comprehensive information on HSCT and translate this to their situation to decide. (ii) \"Balancing between loss and benefit\" reports the process of considering the advantages and disadvantages of continuing with supportive care to treat their disease versus choosing HSCT. (iii) \"Experiencing the impact of HSCT\" describes the impactfull experience of the HSCT period by those who chose HSCT. (iv) \"Balancing again\" refers to reflecting on the decision made. CONCLUSIONS: The hope for a normal life guided the decision-making process, described as a constant balance between the impact of the disease and HSCT. A structured approach to explore patients' and caregivers' perspectives on HSCT decision-making is needed, where specifically discussing the impact of the disease and hope for a normal life need to be integrated in the process.",

We compared HSCT outcomes by conditioning regimen in paediatric patients with SCD from the EBMT registry. In 2010-2020, 251 patients aged <18 years underwent a first matched sibling donor (MSD) HSCT with conditioning based on busulfan-fludarabine (bu-flu; n = 89) or treosulfan-fludarabine (treo-flu; n = 162). In the bu-flu and treo-flu groups, 51.7% and 99.4% of patients, respectively, received thiotepa. Median follow-up was 2.7 years. Two-year overall survival (OS) was 98.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 90.9-99.8) with bu-flu and 99.3% (95% CI: 95.2-99.9) with treo-flu (p = 0.63). Grade III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) at 100 days was 2.4% (95% CI: 0.4-7.5) and 0.6% (0.1%-3.2%) for bu-flu and treo-flu respectively (p = 0.25). The 2-year incidence of extensive chronic GVHD was 1.5% (95% CI: 0.1-7.3) with bu-flu and 8.0% (95% CI: 4.1-13.3) with treo-flu (p = 0.057). These multinational data confirm the excellent curative capacity of MSD HSCT with myeloablative conditioning. Both conditioning regimens yielded excellent OS, low rates of acute and chronic GVHD, and low rates of graft failure.",

OBJECTIVE: In this study, cardiac fibrosis and subclinical cardiac changes in children with sickle cell disease were evaluated using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), tissue Doppler echocardiography and serum galectin-3. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 34 children with sickle cell disease who were compared with a similar number of healthy controls. Cardiac MRI was used to evaluate late gadolinium enhancement, native T1 mapping, extracellular volume, and T2* for estimation of iron load. Cardiac function and myocardial performance index (MPI, evaluated by tissue Doppler echocardiography) and serum galectin-3 were compared to controls. RESULTS: The mean age of the included patients was 13.3 +- 3.2 years. Myocardial iron load by T2* was normal. The mean level of extracellular volume (35.41 +- 5.02%) was significantly associated with the frequency of vaso-occlusive crises (P = 0.017) and negatively correlated with hemoglobin levels (P = 0.005). Galectin-3 levels were significantly higher among cases than controls (P = 0.00), at a cutoff value on the receiver operating characteristic curve of 6.5 ng/ml, sensitivity of 82.5% and specificity of 72.8%. The extracellular volume was significantly higher in cases, with a MPI > 0.4. CONCLUSION: Diffuse interstitial myocardial fibrosis can be detected early in children with sickle cell disease using T1 mapping and is associated with a high frequency of vaso-occlusive crisis. MPI of the left ventricle and serum galectin-3 are recommended screening tools for subclinical cardiac abnormalities.",

However, no previous studies investigated this neurological disorder in Iraqi SCD patients. To address this issue, a total of 52 patients with a median age of 20 years (range 10-46) and including 46.2% males were enrolled. Patients were clinically evaluated and their records were reviewed. They had full blood and reticulocyte counts, hemoglobin F estimation, serum lactic dehydrogenase and bilirubin assayed, as well as brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to screen for silent cerebral infarcts. Six out of the 52 patients (11.5%) had silent cerebral infarcts, all of which were in the deep white matter, ranging from 6 to 10 mm in their largest diameters. There were no significant differences in age, sex, or sickle cell genotype between those with silent cerebral infarcts and those without it. Those with silent cerebral infarcts had lower median hemoglobin, higher reticulocytes and lower pain frequencies than those without it, yet again this was not significant. Follow up MRI in four out of the six silent infarct patients showed no additional lesions and no increase in size of the original ones after six to eight months. In conclusion, it appears that the frequency of silent cerebral infarcts in Iraqi SCD patients is lower than the bulk of the literature from other populations.

OBJECTIVES: The objectives of the study are to determine whether women with sickle cell disease have a greater risk of adverse pregnancy, fetal, and neonatal outcomes than women without sickle cell disease and identify the predictors of adverse pregnancy, fetal, and neonatal outcomes in women with sickle cell disease. DESIGN: A retrospective pair-matched case-control study was conducted to compare 171 pregnant women with sickle cell disease to 171 pregnant women without sickle cell disease in Muscat, Sultanate of Oman. METHODS: All pregnant Omani women with sickle cell disease who delivered between January 2015 and August 2021 at Sultan Qaboos University Hospital and Royal Hospital, who were either primipara or multipara and who had a gestational age of 24-42 weeks, were included as patients, whereas women who had no sickle cell disease or any comorbidity during pregnancy, who delivered within the same timeframe and at the same hospitals, were recruited as controls. The data were retrieved from electronic medical records and delivery registry books between January 2015 and August 2021. RESULTS: Women with sickle cell disease who had severe anemia had increased odds of (chi2 = 58.56, p < 0.001) having adverse pregnancy outcomes. Women with sickle cell disease had 21.97% higher odds of delivering a baby with intrauterine growth retardation (chi2 = 17.80, unadjusted odds ratio = 2.91-166.13, p < 0.001). Newborns born to women with sickle cell disease had 3.93% greater odds of being admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (chi2 = 16.80, unadjusted odds ratio = 1.97-7.84, p < 0.001). In addition, the children born to women with sickle cell disease had 10.90% higher odds of being born with low birth weight (chi2 = 56.92, unadjusted odds ratio = 5.36-22.16, p < 0.001).

However, studies reporting pregnancy, fetal, and neonatal outcomes in women with sickle cell disease are extremely limited. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of the study are to determine whether women with sickle cell disease have a greater risk of adverse pregnancy, fetal, and neonatal outcomes than women without sickle cell disease and identify the predictors of adverse pregnancy, fetal, and neonatal outcomes in women with sickle cell disease. DESIGN: A retrospective pair-matched case-control study was conducted to compare 171 pregnant women with sickle cell disease to 171 pregnant women without sickle cell disease in Muscat, Sultanate of Oman. METHODS: All pregnant Omani women with sickle cell disease who delivered between January 2015 and August 2021 at Sultan Qaboos University Hospital and Royal Hospital, who were either primipara or multipara and who had a gestational age of 24-42 weeks, were included as patients, whereas women who had no sickle cell disease or any comorbidity during pregnancy, who delivered within the same timeframe and at the same hospitals, were recruited as controls. The data were retrieved from electronic medical records and delivery registry books between January 2015 and August 2021. RESULTS: Women with sickle cell disease who had severe anemia had increased odds of (chi2 = 58.56, p < 0.001) having adverse pregnancy outcomes. Women with sickle cell disease had 21.97% higher odds of delivering a baby with intrauterine growth retardation (chi2 = 17.80, unadjusted odds ratio = 2.91-166.13, p < 0.001). Newborns born to women with sickle cell disease had 3.93% greater odds of being admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (chi2 = 16.80, unadjusted odds ratio = 1.97-7.84, p < 0.001). In addition, the children born to women with sickle cell disease had 10.90% higher odds of being born with low birth weight (chi2 = 56.92, unadjusted odds ratio = 5.36-22.16, p < 0.001). Hemoglobin level (odds ratio = 0.17, p < 0.001, 95% confidence interval = 0.10-3.0), past medical history (odds ratio = 7.95, p < 0.001, 95% confidence interval = 2.39-26.43), past surgical history (odds ratio = 17.69, p < 0.001, 95% confidence interval = 3.41-91.76), and preterm delivery (odds ratio = 9.48, p = 0.005, 95% confidence interval = 1.95-46.23) were identified as predictors of adverse pregnancy, fetal, and neonatal outcomes in women with sickle cell disease. CONCLUSION: As pregnant women with sickle cell disease are at increased risk for pregnancy, fetal, and neonatal adverse outcomes; improved antenatal surveillance and management may improve the outcomes.",

OBJECTIVES: The objectives of the study are to determine whether women with sickle cell disease have a greater risk of adverse pregnancy, fetal, and neonatal outcomes than women without sickle cell disease and identify the predictors of adverse pregnancy, fetal, and neonatal outcomes in women with sickle cell disease. DESIGN: A retrospective pair-matched case-control study was conducted to compare 171 pregnant women with sickle cell disease to 171 pregnant women without sickle cell disease in Muscat, Sultanate of Oman. METHODS: All pregnant Omani women with sickle cell disease who delivered between January 2015 and August 2021 at Sultan Qaboos University Hospital and Royal Hospital, who were either primipara or multipara and who had a gestational age of 24-42 weeks, were included as patients, whereas women who had no sickle cell disease or any comorbidity during pregnancy, who delivered within the same timeframe and at the same hospitals, were recruited as controls.

This qualitative descriptive study was conducted to explore perspectives on buprenorphine for chronic pain in sickle cell disease. We interviewed 13 participants with sickle cell disease who had been prescribed buprenorphine and had a clinic visit between December 1, 2020 and April, 2022 in our Sickle Cell Center for Adults. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis. Eleven out of 13 participants were taking buprenorphine at the time of the interview, with mean treatment duration of 33 months (SD 18, range 7 to 78 months). Five major themes were identified: 1) dissatisfaction with full agonist opioids; 2) navigating uncertainty with autonomy in deciding to try buprenorphine; 3) functional and relational changes after starting buprenorphine, 4) enduring systemic barriers to pain treatment, and 5) trusting treatment relationships are necessary when approaching patients about buprenorphine.

Evidence is lacking that assesses how split daily buprenorphine-naloxone affects OUD outcomes. This study aims to evaluate how the dosing frequency of SL buprenorphine-naloxone impacts therapy effectiveness when treating patients with OUD. METHODS: This retrospective analysis included adult outpatients prescribed treatment with SL buprenorphine-naloxone for OUD between July 1, 2016, and March 1, 2020. The study excluded patients with sickle cell disease, recent methadone treatment, or pregnancy. We characterized study groups by dosing frequency, either once daily or split dosing. The study compared retention in treatment, medication adherence, adherence to treatment program, and hospital encounters between groups. RESULTS: The study screened eight-hundred and seven patients, and included 250 patients newly prescribed SL buprenorphine-naloxone. Fifty-seven patients (22.8 %) were prescribed once daily dosing and 193 patients (77.2 %) were prescribed split daily dosing.

Within a year of buprenorphine-naloxone initiation, the study found no differences in the percentage of patients with hospitalizations (26.3 % vs. 38.3 %, p = .10), median number of hospitalizations (2 vs. 2), or proportion of days covered by a prescription >=80 % (93.3 % vs. 92.0 %, p = .82). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, patients receiving once daily buprenorphine-naloxone had similar treatment outcomes to patients receiving split dosing. Further controlled studies are necessary to evaluate which patients are more likely to benefit from split dosing.",

Evidence is lacking that assesses how split daily buprenorphine-naloxone affects OUD outcomes. This study aims to evaluate how the dosing frequency of SL buprenorphine-naloxone impacts therapy effectiveness when treating patients with OUD. METHODS: This retrospective analysis included adult outpatients prescribed treatment with SL buprenorphine-naloxone for OUD between July 1, 2016, and March 1, 2020. The study excluded patients with sickle cell disease, recent methadone treatment, or pregnancy. We characterized study groups by dosing frequency, either once daily or split dosing. The study compared retention in treatment, medication adherence, adherence to treatment program, and hospital encounters between groups. RESULTS: The study screened eight-hundred and seven patients, and included 250 patients newly prescribed SL buprenorphine-naloxone. Fifty-seven patients (22.8 %) were prescribed once daily dosing and 193 patients (77.2 %) were prescribed split daily dosing. The study found no significant differences noted in 12-month rates of treatment retention (52.6 % vs. 45.6 %, p = .35). These outcomes remained similar when assessed at three and six months.

We report a case of painless orbital bone infarction masquerading as periorbital cellulitis in a child with sickle cell anemia. CASE REPORT A 4-year-old Saudi girl with sickle cell disease presented to our hospital with vaso-occlusive crisis characterized by bilateral lower limb pain and painless left orbital swelling. On examination, she had swelling of the left upper eyelid with redness and mild ptosis (margin reflex distance 1 was 2 mm) without proptosis. Magnetic resonance imaging with contrast showed bilateral sub-periosteal heterogeneous collections (2x0.8x2.1 cm in the superolateral wall of the left orbit and 1x0.6 cm in the inferolateral wall of the right orbit), with intermediate-to-high T1 signal intensity and high T2 signal, causing a mass effect on the adjacent superior and lateral rectus muscles. The patient was treated with systemic antibiotics and supportive treatment for vaso-occlusive crisis under the care of the pediatric team and was discharged without complications. CONCLUSIONS The diagnosis of sickle cell orbitopathy can be challenging, and an accurate diagnosis is essential to ensure appropriate management.

To reduce alloimmunization some strategies have been implemented to provide limited or extended antigen matched RBC transfusions to patients with SCD who need chronic transfusion support. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of prophylactic RBC transfusion with extended antigen matching on alloimmunization in patients with SCD. METHODS: This is a 20-year retrospective study of patients with SCD transfused with RBCS that were prospectively matched for D, C, c, E, e, K, Fya/Fyb, Jka/Jkb and S antigens. Our study included 95 patients, and none had antibodies documented before their first transfusion. Patients and donors were phenotyped and molecular typing was performed in all patients who had recent transfusions or a positive direct antiglobulin test to predict their antigen profile. Unexpected antibodies to the Rh system, meaning anti-Rh antibodies in patients whose serologic phenotype was Rh positive, were investigated by molecular genotyping for RH variant alleles. RESULTS: During this study-period, 12 (12.6%) were alloimmunized and 83 (87.4%) were not. Among the 12 patients who alloimmunized, 7 (58.3%) developed antibodies to Rh antigens and 5 (41.7%) produced antibodies to low prevalence antigens. All patients who developed Rh antibodies had RH variant alleles. Autoantibodies were found in 16 (16.8%) transfused patients. CONCLUSION: SCD patients benefit from receiving prophylactic RBC transfusions with extended antigen matching, as demonstrated by the reduction on the rates of alloimmunization and the lack of antibodies to K, FY, JK and S antigens, however, this strategy does not avoid alloimmunization to Rh and low-prevalence antigens.",

Among the 12 patients who alloimmunized, 7 (58.3%) developed antibodies to Rh antigens and 5 (41.7%) produced antibodies to low prevalence antigens. All patients who developed Rh antibodies had RH variant alleles. Autoantibodies were found in 16 (16.8%) transfused patients. CONCLUSION: SCD patients benefit from receiving prophylactic RBC transfusions with extended antigen matching, as demonstrated by the reduction on the rates of alloimmunization and the lack of antibodies to K, FY, JK and S antigens, however, this strategy does not avoid alloimmunization to Rh and low-prevalence antigens.",

                    "text": "Prevention of neurovascular complications in children with Sickle Cell Disease in the real-world setting: What adult medicine physicians should know.Neurovascular complications represent one of the most detrimental manifestations of Sickle Cell Disease (SCD), affecting many patients since infancy. They include overt stroke, silent cerebral infarcts and neurocognitive disorders. In fact, neurodevelopment can be impaired in children resulting in cognitive dysfunction in adults with SCD. This review is meant to resume the most recent guidelines about the prevention of SCD neurovascular complications and to highlight the open challenges in their implementation. Transcranial Doppler, Magnetic Resonance Imaging/Angiography and neurocognitive test are useful screening tools. Chronic transfusion regimen, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and neurocognitive rehabilitation find indications in the context of primary and secondary prevention of neurovascular complications of SCD. However, international guidelines are often difficult to bring into the real world due to the lack of appropriate instruments and trained personnel. Many challenges have still to be faced to guarantee the best possible neurocognitive function to each child affected by SCD.",

However, its effectiveness in preventing chronic organ damage is still unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the role of hydroxyurea in preventing organ morbidity. METHOD: We included original articles published in English from 1st January 1990 to 31st January 2023, reporting hydroxyurea therapy and organ damage from PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, and CrossRef databases. A total of 45 studies with 4681 sickle cell disease patients were evaluated for organ damage. RESULTS: Our analysis showed that hydroxyurea intervention significantly lowered transcranial Doppler and tricuspid regurgitant velocity, with a standardized mean difference of - 1.03 (- 1.49; - 0.58); I 2 = 96% and - 1.37 (CI - 2.31, - 0.42); I 2 = 94%, respectively. Moreover, the pooled estimate for albuminuria showed a beneficial effect post-hydroxyurea therapy by reducing the risk of albuminuria by 58% (risk ratio of 0.42 (0.28; 0.63); I 2 = 28%). CONCLUSION: Our study found that a hydroxyurea dose above 20 mg/kg/day with a mean rise in HbF by 18.46% post-hydroxyurea therapy had a beneficial role in reducing transcranial doppler velocity, tricuspid regurgitant velocity, albuminuria, and splenic abnormality.

Physiological changes during pregnancy increase the risk of vaso-occlusive crises (VOC), acute chest syndrome, venous thromboembolic events, and infections. This concerns haemoglobin (Hb) S/C and S/beta+-thalassaemia patients as much than S/S or S/beta0-thalassaemia patients. SCD also increases the risk of obstetrical complications, such as preeclampsia, in utero foetal death, preterm delivery mostly induced, and intrauterine growth restriction.

Preventive blood transfusion is not systematic, but is recommended in the case of a pre-existing transfusion program prior to pregnancy, severe pre-existing organ damage, severe obstetric history, and severe or repeated crises during follow-up, especially in patients taking HU before.

Physiological changes during pregnancy increase the risk of vaso-occlusive crises (VOC), acute chest syndrome, venous thromboembolic events, and infections. This concerns haemoglobin (Hb) S/C and S/beta+-thalassaemia patients as much than S/S or S/beta0-thalassaemia patients. SCD also increases the risk of obstetrical complications, such as preeclampsia, in utero foetal death, preterm delivery mostly induced, and intrauterine growth restriction. Thus, pregnancy should be planned and closely monitored by a multidisciplinary team involving obstetricians and sickle cell disease specialists. Before pregnancy, the parents should also be informed about the risk of transmission of this autosomal recessive disease, and the father should therefore be prescribed haemoglobin electrophoresis. Treatments have to be revised when planning pregnancy: hydroxyurea (HU) should be stopped as soon as pregnancy is suspected or confirmed. Preventive blood transfusion is not systematic, but is recommended in the case of a pre-existing transfusion program prior to pregnancy, severe pre-existing organ damage, severe obstetric history, and severe or repeated crises during follow-up, especially in patients taking HU before. Despite the risks of prematurity, systematic administration of corticosteroids for foetal lung maturation is not recommended due to the risk of maternal vaso-occlusive event. Although more frequent, due to obstetrical and maternal complications, caesarean section is not systematic, in the absence of maternal contraindications. It is advisable not to exceed the term of 39 weeks of amenorrhoea. Post-partum follow-up is recommended, particularly because of the risk of thromboembolism.",

However, most studies have been in adults and have evaluated SARS-CoV-2 loads using cycle thresholds (Ct) values, which are not standardized preventing consistent interpretation critical to understanding clinical impact and utility. Here, a quantitative SARS-CoV-2 reverse-transcription digital PCR (RT-dPCR) assay normalized to WHO International Units was applied to children at risk of severe disease diagnosed with COVID-19 at St Jude Children's Research Hospital between March 28, 2020, and January 31, 2022. METHODS: Demographic and clinical information from children, adolescents and young adults treated at St Jude Children's Research Hospital were abstracted from medical records. Respiratory samples underwent SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantitation by RT-dPCR targeting N1 and N2 genes, with sequencing to determine the genetic lineage of infecting virus. RESULTS: Four hundred and sixty-two patients aged 0-24 years (median 11 years old) were included during the study period. Most patients were infected by the omicron variant (43.72%), followed by ancestral strain (22.29%), delta (13.20%) and alpha (2.16%). Viral load at presentation ranged from 2.49 to 9.14 log10 IU/ml, and higher viral RNA loads were associated with symptoms (OR 1.32: CI95% 1.16-1.49) and respiratory disease (OR 1.23: CI95% 1.07-1.41). Viral load did not differ by SARS-CoV-2 variant, vaccination status, age, or baseline diagnosis. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 RNA loads predict the presence of symptomatic and respiratory diseases. The use of standardized, quantitative methods is feasible, allows for replication, comparisons across institutions, and has the potential to facilitate consensus quantitative thresholds for risk stratification and treatment.",

METHODS: This institutional cohort retrospective study was conducted in a Referral Center for Ophthalmological Rare Diseases.

Dual-energy CT (DECT) iodine perfusion map reconstructions can provide a method to visualize and quantify the extent of pulmonary microthrombi. METHODS: A total of 102 patients with sickle cell disease who underwent DECT CTPA with perfusion were retrospectively identified. The presence or absence of airspace opacities, segmental perfusion defects, and acute or chronic pulmonary emboli was noted. The number of segmental perfusion defects between patients with and without acute chest syndrome was compared. Sub-analyses were performed to investigate robustness. RESULTS: Of the 102 patients, 68 were clinically determined to not have ACS and 34 were determined to have ACS by clinical criteria. Of the patients with ACS, 82.4% were found to have perfusion defects with a median of 2 perfusion defects per patient.

Because of physical/mental trauma arising from the 9/11 attacks, Program members might be at high risk of opioid use. To prevent prescription opioid overuse, in 2018 the Program implemented various measures to improve opioid prescribing and expand access to non-opioid pain management among Program members. However, the characteristics of opioid prescriptions dispensed among this population has never been described. METHODS: Administrative and claims data from 07/01/2011 to 09/30/2022 were used to describe opioid prescriptions dispensed during 2013-2021. RESULTS: From 2013-2021, 108,285 members were Program-enrolled for >= 10 months, 4,053 (3.7%) had 22,938 outpatient opioid prescriptions, of which, 62.1% were for cancer-related pain, 11.1% for hospice/end of life care, 4.8% for surgery pain, and 9.8% for acute/chronic pain. Among members with Program-paid diagnostic/treatment claims (n = 70,721), the proportion with opioid prescriptions for cancer/hospice/end of life care increased from 0.5% in 2013 to 1.6% in 2018 (p = 0.010), then decreased to 1.1% in 2021 (p = 0.070), and the proportion for non-cancer surgery/acute/chronic pain decreased from 0.6% in 2013 to 0.23% in 2021 (p = 0.0005). Among members prescribed opioids without cancer/hospice/sickle cell disease, the proportion who started with long-acting opioids or had opioid prescriptions from >= 4 prescribers were below 6.5% annually; the proportion receiving a high-dose (>= 90 morphine milligram equivalents per day [MED]), or with concurrent opioids and benzodiazepines use, or who started opioids with MED >= 50 or with long duration (>= 7 days' supply) were above 10% annually, but decreased since 2017. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of outpatient opioid prescriptions paid by the Program was very low and prescriptions were primarily dispensed for cancer/hospice/end of life care. Although Program efforts to improve opioid prescribing coincided with improvements in outcomes, ongoing surveillance is needed.",

Among members with Program-paid diagnostic/treatment claims (n = 70,721), the proportion with opioid prescriptions for cancer/hospice/end of life care increased from 0.5% in 2013 to 1.6% in 2018 (p = 0.010), then decreased to 1.1% in 2021 (p = 0.070), and the proportion for non-cancer surgery/acute/chronic pain decreased from 0.6% in 2013 to 0.23% in 2021 (p = 0.0005). Among members prescribed opioids without cancer/hospice/sickle cell disease, the proportion who started with long-acting opioids or had opioid prescriptions from >= 4 prescribers were below 6.5% annually; the proportion receiving a high-dose (>= 90 morphine milligram equivalents per day [MED]), or with concurrent opioids and benzodiazepines use, or who started opioids with MED >= 50 or with long duration (>= 7 days' supply) were above 10% annually, but decreased since 2017. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of outpatient opioid prescriptions paid by the Program was very low and prescriptions were primarily dispensed for cancer/hospice/end of life care. Although Program efforts to improve opioid prescribing coincided with improvements in outcomes, ongoing surveillance is needed.",

Management of femoral head avascular necrosis (AVN) using total hip replacement (THR) in sickle cell disease (SCD) is widespread in developed countries, but it is still in its initiation stage in developing countries. The outcome of using cementless THR among SCD patients is still unknown with lack of published studies from regional countries. This study aimed to evaluate the outcome of using cementless primary THR among patients with sickle cell disease with end-stage hip avascular necrosis in Yemen. METHODS: Thirty cementless primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) were performed for AVN of the femoral head in 27 sickle cell patients, at Al.-Thawra Modern General Hospital-Sana'a, Yemen, from January 2018 to December 2022. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 27 +- five years (ranged 18-37 years) with a male to female ratio was 3:1. Steinberg staging for hip AVN was stage IV, one patient (3%); stage VI, thirteen patients (45%); and stage V, sixteen patients (51%). THR was on right side 14 (52%), left side 10 (37%), and bilateral 3 (11%). The implant used was ceramic on polyethylene acetabular liner. All patients showed improvement in Harris hip score from preoperative mean hip score was 25 +- 8 points to postoperative mean hip score was 88 +- 6 points at the last follow-up. Mean of the length of stay in hospital was 12.7 +- eight days (ranged from 4 to 32 days); the mean operating time was 107 +- 23 min. Three cases had superficial wound infection; four patients had five intraoperative fractures; two cases had pulmonary complications; one case had abdominal crisis. All patients had postoperative leg length discrepancy less than 2 cm. None had deep infection, nerve injury, wound hematoma, aseptic loosing, dislocation, DVT, heterotopic ossification, or death. CONCLUSION: THR in SCD has a good outcome using cementless THA with a low rate of complication in Yemen, a developing country.",

OBJECTIVE: To validate the content of an updated Social-Ecological Model of Adolescent and Young Adult Readiness for Transition to Promote Health Equity (SMART-E) in a group of adolescents and young adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) and their supports. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Health equity framework components were reviewed. Systems of power (eg, institutional and practitioner bias) and environments or networks (eg, peer or school support) were added as SMART-E preexisting factors, and health literacy was included within readiness factors. Adolescents and young adults aged 16 to 29 years with SCD, caregivers, and practitioners participated in this convergent, mixed-methods study within Children's Hospital of Philadelphia between January and August 2022. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Content validity was assessed through nominations of top 3 most important transition barriers prior to interviews and focus groups, ratings on importance of SMART-E factors (0-4 scale; ratings >2 support validity) after interviews and focus groups, nominations of 3 most important factors for transition and for health equity, and qualitative content analysis of interview transcripts. RESULTS: The study enrolled 10 pediatric adolescents and young adults (mean [SD] age, 18.6 [2.9] years; 4 female and 6 male), 10 transferred adolescents and young adults (mean [SD] age, 22.9 [2.1] years; 8 female and 2 male), 9 caregivers (mean [SD] age, 49.8 [8.7] years; 5 female and 4 male), and 9 practitioners (mean [SD] age, 45.6 [10.5] years; 8 female and 1 male). Quantitative ratings supported the content validity of SMART-E and met established criteria for validity. Systems of power was the most endorsed transition barrier (14 of 38 participants) reported prior to interviews and focus groups. After the interview, participants endorsed all SMART-E factors as important for transition, with new factors systems of power and environments and networks rated at a mean (SD) 2.8 (1.23) and 3.1 (0.90), respectively, on a 0 to 4 scale of importance. The most important factors for transition and equity varied by participant group, with all factors being endorsed, supporting the comprehensiveness of SMART-E. Qualitative data corroborated quantitative findings, further supporting validity, and minor modifications were made to definitions. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: SMART-E obtained initial content validation with inclusion of health equity factors for adolescents and young adults with SCD, caregivers, and practitioners.

In SCD, DHTR is a potentially life-threatening. Blood group polymorphism in SCD patients, who are of African ancestry and frequently exposed to antigens they do not carry; an inflammatory clinical state; and occasional transfusion in acute situations are risk factors for alloimmunization and DHTR. In patients at risk, the transfusion indication must be balanced against the risk of developing DHTR. However, when transfusion is absolutely necessary, protocols combining the prevention of exposure to immunogenic antigens with immunosuppressive treatments must be implemented, and patients should be carefully monitored during posttransfusion follow-up. This close monitoring makes it possible to diagnose hyperhemolysis as soon as possible; to avoid retransfusion, which can exacerbate hemolysis; and to administer specific treatments, such as anticomplement therapy, in severe cases. Finally, in patients with severe disease, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation may be indicated. However, transfusion is also required in this context, and its management is complex because these risks must be taken into account.",

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) is curative, but the presence of mixed donor/recipient chimerism post-HCT raises concerns about disease control long-term. Mixed donor/recipient chimerism is reported in significant numbers even after aggressive HCT conditioning regimens. Post-HCT, adequacy of donor erythropoiesis is crucial for disease control. This review explores the relationship between mixed donor/recipient chimerism and outcomes post-HCT. Serial chimerism analysis in lineage specific manner in erythroid or myeloid cells post-HCT predicts for disease control and HCT success. Adequate and stable donor-derived erythropoiesis is essential for reversing SCD manifestations. Myeloid lineage chimerism mirrors erythropoiesis is commercially available, and a reliable indicator of adequacy. Using this tool, the minimum threshold of donor chimerism is required to prevent SCD-related complications and maintain sickle hemoglobin less than 50% is approximately 20-25% even when a donor has Hb S trait. Curative interventions should, at a minimum, meet this goal long-term.

One year after HCT, patients showed marked improvement in cardiac chamber morphology by CMR, including left ventricular (LV) mass and volume (70.2 to 60.1 g/m2, p = 0.02; 114.5 to 90.6 mL/m2, p = 0.001). Furthermore, mean TRV normalized by 1 year, suggesting that HCT may offer a survival benefit. Fewer patients had pathologically prolonged native myocardial T1 times, an indirect marker of myocardial fibrosis at 1 year; these data showed a trend toward significance. In this small sample, CMR was very sensitive in detecting cardiac mass and volume changes after HCT and provided complementary information to echocardiography. Notably, post-HCT improvement in cardiac parameters can be attributed only in part to the resolution of anemia; further studies are required to determine the role of myocardial fibrosis reversal, improved blood flow, and survival impact after HCT for SCD.",

While several nucleases such as zinc-finger nucleases (ZFN), transcriptor activator-like effector nucleases (TALEN), and meganucleases have been explored, the advent of CRISPR/Cas9 technology has revolutionized the field of genome engineering.

At our institution, we have implemented an inpatient service, the Med-Peds (MP) line, to improve transitions to adult care and reduce hospital utilization by young adults with CCOD. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the effect of the MP line on length of stay (LOS) and 30-day readmission rates compared to other inpatient services. METHODS: This was an observational, retrospective cohort analysis of patients admitted to the MP line compared to other hospital service lines over a 2-year period. To avoid potential confounding by indication for admission to the MP line, propensity score weighting methods were used. RESULTS: The MP line cared for 302 patients with CCOD from June 2019 to July 2021. Compared to other service lines, there was a 33% reduction in relative risk of 30-day readmission (26.9% compared to 40.3%, risk ratio = 0.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.55-0.81). LOS was 10% longer for the MP line (event time ratio (ETR): 1.10 95% CI 1.0-1.21) with median LOS 4.8 versus 4.5 days. Patients with sickle cell disease had less of a reduction in 30-day readmissions and longer LOS. CONCLUSION: Hospitalization for young adults with CCOD on a MP service line was associated with lower 30-day readmission rates and longer LOS than hospitalization on other services. Further research is needed to assess which components of the line most contribute to decreased utilization.",

                    "text": "Nosocomial infections in sickle cell anemia patients: Prevention through multi-disciplinary approach: A review.Sickle cell anemia (SCA), a hereditary blood disorder characterized by the presence of abnormal hemoglobin, poses a unique set of challenges for both patients and healthcare providers. One of the most pressing issues in the care of these individuals is the persistent threat of nosocomial infections, which are infections acquired during hospitalization. This abstract provides a concise overview of the ongoing challenge of nosocomial infections in SCA patients, highlighting the factors contributing to their vulnerability and the preventive measures in place. SCA patients face increased susceptibility to nosocomial infections due to their compromised immune systems, frequent hospitalizations, prolonged stays, and the need for invasive medical interventions. The emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens further complicates the management of these infections. To address this challenge, healthcare facilities have implemented infection control protocols, vaccination strategies, and antimicrobial stewardship, emphasizing the importance of patient education. Recognizing the gravity of this issue and adopting comprehensive preventive measures is crucial to improving the quality of care and patient outcomes in this vulnerable population. Further research and ongoing efforts are essential to reducing the burden of nosocomial infections in SCA patients and enhancing their overall healthcare experience.",

ALIGN aimed to embed Individualized Pain Plans in the electronic health record (E-IPP) and provide access to the plan for both adult patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and emergency department providers when a person with SCD comes to the emergency department in vaso-occlusive crises. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with research teams from the 8 participating sites from the ALIGN study. Seventeen participants (principal investigators and study coordinators) shared their perspectives about the implementation of ALIGN in their sites. Data were analyzed in three phases using open coding steps adapted from grounded theory and qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: A total of seven overarching themes were identified: (1) the E-IPP structure (location and upkeep) and collaboration with the informatics team, (2) the role of ED champion, (3) the role of research coordinators, (4) research team communication, and communication between research team and clinical team, (5) challenges with the study protocol, (6) provider feedback: addressing over-utilizers, patient mistrust, and the positive feedback about the intervention, and (7) COVID-19 and its effects on study implementation. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study contribute to learning how to implement E-IPPs for adult patients with SCD in ED. The study findings highlight the importance of early engagement with different team members, a champion from the emergency department, study coordinators with different skills and enhancement of communication and trust among team members.

In North Cyprus, in addition to other reasons, early prenatal diagnostic measures are undertaken to prevent births with thalassemia major, a locally widespread genetic disease. AIM: This study aims to evaluate the results of prenatal invasive diagnostic tests performed in a private obstetrics clinic in Northern Cyprus and show the diagnosis process of thalassemia and chromosomal anomalies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study is a retrospective, descriptive study. Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) results and the amniocentesis tests performed between 1990 and 2022 are evaluated. Thalassemia and chromosome analysis of samples obtained by CVS and amniocentesis tests were performed. To diagnose alpha or beta thalassemia and sickle cell, 239 CVS was performed. And to diagnose chromosomal anomalies, 396 CVS and amniocentesis were performed. RESULTS: The mean age of the 480 pregnant women included in the study was 31.12 years (18-46) and 30% of them were older than 34 years. The most common indications for invasive prenatal diagnostic test (IPDT) were; mother/father thalassemia minor/major, advanced maternal age, high risk of ultrasonography erase findings, and the noninvasive screening test. The result of IPDT detected 7.3% chromosomal anomaly and 69.5% thalassemia and sickle cell anemia. Of the 239 CVS performed to diagnose alpha or beta thalasemia and sickle cell, 23.4% beta major, 42.3% beta minor, and 2.1% alpha minor were diagnosed. Of the 396 CVS and amniocentesis performed to diagnose chromosomal anormalies; 2.8% of Down syndrome and 4.54% of other chromosomal anomalies were diagnosed.

Alloimmunization in this population is frequent and can complicate transfusion management during the HSCT period. The case of a pediatric patient with severe SCD clinical phenotype, multiple alloantibodies (9), and hyperhemolysis syndrome who underwent haploidentical HSCT is described. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The patient was known for an anti-e, despite RHCE*01.01 allele, which predicts a C- c+ E- weak e+ phenotype. Donors matching the patient's extended phenotype were targeted for RHCE genotyping. RESULTS: Donors homozygotes or heterozygotes for RHCE*01.01 were selected for compatibility analyses and ranked based on strength of reactions. Discordance between zygosity and strength of reactions was observed, as the most compatible donors were heterozygotes for RHCE*01.01. In total, the patient received seven RBC units from two different donors during HSCT process without transfusion reaction or development of new alloantibodies. Six months post-HSCT, his hemoglobin level is stable at around 120 g/L and his chimerism is 100%. DISCUSSION: This case highlights the complexity of transfusion management during HSCT of alloimmunized patients with SCD. Collecting sufficient compatible units requires early involvement of transfusion medicine teams and close communication with the local blood provider. Genotyping of donors self-identifying as Black is useful for identifying compatible blood for those patients but has some limitations. HSCT for heavily alloimmunized patients is feasible and safe with early involvement of transfusion medicine specialists. Further research on the clinical impact of genotypic matching is needed.",

Few studies have used ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) in pediatric patients with SCA. The aim of this study was to characterize the ABPM profile in children with SCA. METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted on all subjects <18 years of age with SCA who presented at a medical reference center in the city of Cartagena, Colombia. Anthropometric, clinical laboratory, treatment, and ABPM parameters, including ambulatory arterial stiffness index (AASI) were registered. RESULTS: The study included 79 patients, of these, 23 (29%) children had normal BP, 49 (62%) had abnormal BP and 7 (9%) had HTN. Mean age was 10.5 +- 3.6 years and 44 (56%) cases were male. Forty-eight (60%) patients had pre-HTN. Masked HTN was present in 6 (8%) patients. One (1%) had ambulatory HTN, and another one (1%) had white coat HTN. The HTA group exhibited significantly higher systolic BP and diastolic BP compared to the other groups in 24-hour BP readings, daytime BP, and night-time BP ABPM parameters (P < 0.05), except for daytime DBP (P = 0.08). Mean AASI was 0.4 +- 0.2. The HTN group had the highest AASI value compared to the other groups (P = 0.006). CONCLUSION: Significant alterations in ABPM parameters are frequently observed in pediatric patients with SCA. The incorporation of ABPM, along with the assessment of AASI, is recommended for a comprehensive evaluation of cardiovascular and renal risk in SCA patients.",

Here, we used whole-genome sequencing to track hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from six patients with SCD at pre- and post-GT time points to map the somatic mutation and clonal landscape of gene-modified and unmodified HSCs. Pre-GT, phylogenetic trees were highly polyclonal and mutation burdens per cell were elevated in some, but not all, patients. Post-GT, no clonal expansions were identified among gene-modified or unmodified cells; however, an increased frequency of potential driver mutations associated with myeloid neoplasms or clonal hematopoiesis (DNMT3A- and EZH2-mutated clones in particular) was observed in both genetically modified and unmodified cells, suggesting positive selection of mutant clones during GT. This work sheds light on HSC clonal dynamics and the mutational landscape after GT in SCD, highlighting the enhanced fitness of some HSCs harboring pre-existing driver mutations. Future studies should define the long-term fate of mutant clones, including any contribution to expansions associated with myeloid neoplasms.",

Although numerous genetic variants have been identified as contributors to QT interval prolongation in the general population, their impact on SCD patients remains unclear. This study used an unweighted polygenic risk score (PRS) to validate the previously identified associations between SNPs and QTc interval in SCD patients, and to explore possible interactions with other factors that prolong QTc interval in AA individuals with SCD. METHODS: In SCD patients, candidate genetic variants associated with the QTc interval were genotyped. To identify any risk SNPs that may be correlated with QTc interval prolongation, linear regression was employed, and an unweighted PRS was subsequently constructed. The effect of PRS on the QTc interval was evaluated using linear regression, while stratification analysis was used to assess the influence of serum alanine transaminase (ALT), a biomarker for liver disease, on the PRS effect. We also evaluated the PRS with the two subcomponents of QTc, the QRS and JTc intervals. RESULTS: Out of 26 candidate SNPs, five risk SNPs were identified for QTc duration under the recessive model. For every unit increase in PRS, the QTc interval prolonged by 4.0ms (95% CI: [2.0, 6.1]; p-value: <0.001) in the additive model and 9.4ms in the recessive model (95% CI: [4.6, 14.1]; p-value: <0.001). Serum ALT showed a modification effect on PRS-QTc prolongation under the recessive model. In the normal ALT group, each PRS unit increased QTc interval by 11.7ms (95% CI: [6.3, 17.1]; p-value: 2.60E-5), whereas this effect was not observed in the elevated ALT group (0.9ms; 95% CI: [-7.0, 8.8]; p-value: 0.823). CONCLUSION: Several candidate genetic variants are associated with QTc interval prolongation in SCD patients, and serum ALT acts as a modifying factor. The association of a CPS1 gene variant in both QTc and JTc duration adds to NOS1AP as evidence of involvement of the urea cycle and nitric oxide metabolism in cardiac repolarization in SCD.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Sickle cell disease patients with no history of stroke were prospectively evaluated for cerebrovascular reactivity using the breath-holding test (BHT), the sympatho-vagal balance (ratio low frequency/high frequency [HF]) using heart rate variability parameters and cerebral autoregulation in the time domain using correlation index Mx, and arterial cerebral compliance based on continuous assessment of cerebral blood flow velocities using transcranial Doppler ultrasound and arterial blood pressure with photo-plethysmography. WMLs were assessed with magnetic resonance imaging using Fazekas score grading and the presence of lacunes. Forty-one patients (F/M 25/16) were included. Median age was 37.5 years (19-65). Twenty-nine (70.7%) patients had SS genotype. Eleven patients had WMLs (26.8%). Patients with WMLs were significantly older (p < 0.001), had a lower HF (p < 0.005) and an impaired cerebral arterial compliance (p < 0.014). The receiver operating curve for the regression model including age and HF showed a higher area under the curve compared to age alone (0.946 vs. 0.876). BHT and Mx did not significantly differ between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Lower parasympathetic activity and impaired cerebral arterial compliance were associated with WMLs in adults with SCD. This could potentially yield to a better understanding of pathophysiological parameters leading to premature cerebrovascular ageing in SCD.",

We compared blood pressure values and trajectories in the composite cohort and in each genotype group to control values in a non-SCD pregnancy dataset. There were 290 pregnancies among 197 patients with SCD. Sixteen per cent (n = 47) of pregnancies had a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy (HDP); the rates did not differ by genotype. The mean SBP and DBP were lower in the HbSS/HbSbeta0 group than in the non-SCD control group at all timepoints. Mean SBP and DBP trajectories were similar between the HbSS/HbSbeta0 group and non-SCD controls, whereas the mean SBP and DBP in the HbSC/HbSbeta+ group decreased between the first and second trimesters and plateaued between the second and third trimesters. There were no differences in blood pressure trajectory by haemoglobin >/< 10 gm/dL or by chronic transfusion status. Overall, pregnant people with SCD have lower blood pressure than unaffected pregnant people, raising the possibility that HDP are underdiagnosed, particularly in people with HbSS/HbSbeta0 .",

Proliferative sickle cell retinopathy (SCR) is a well-described complication of SCD and can result in significant sight loss, although the prevalence in the UK is not currently known. There are currently no national screening guidelines for SCR, with wide variations in the management of the condition across the UK. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Sickle Eye Project is an epidemiological, cross-sectional, non-interventional study to determine the prevalence of visual impairment due to SCR and/or maculopathy in the UK. Haematologists in at least 16 geographically dispersed hospitals in the UK linked to participating eye clinics will offer study participation to consecutive patients meeting the inclusion criteria attending the sickle cell clinic. The following study procedures will be performed: (a) best corrected visual acuity with habitual correction and pinhole, (b) dilated slit lamp biomicroscopy and funduscopy, (c) optical coherence tomography (OCT), (d) OCT angiography where available, (e) ultrawide fundus photography, (f) National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire-25 and (g) acceptability of retinal screening questionnaire. The primary outcome is the proportion of people with SCD with visual impairment defined as logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution >=0.3 in at least one eye. Secondary outcomes include the prevalence of each stage of SCR and presence of maculopathy by age and genotype; correlation of stage of SCR and maculopathy to severity of SCD; the impact of SCR and presence of maculopathy on vision-related quality of life; and the acceptability to patients of routine retinal imaging for SCR and maculopathy.

OBJECTIVES: This study assessed the prevalence, pattern and predictors of renal dysfunction in SCD patients and investigated the associated renal histopathologic changes. METHODS: We evaluated 105 patients with SCD, for proteinuria, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and tubular dysfunction. Renal biopsy was conducted on 22 patients who qualified. Data were analysed using SPSS package version 23. RESULTS: Thirty-seven (35.2%) of the 105 patients had CKD, as defined by an eGFR of 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 and/or proteinuria. The fractional excretion of potassium (FEK) was elevated in all patients, whereas the fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) was elevated in 98.1%.

Age, irreversible percentage sickle cell count, haemoglobin levels and FENa were the major predictors of CKD.

CONCLUSIONS: CKD was prevalent in SCD patients, and it was characterised by tubular dysfunction and mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis. The main predictors of CKD were increased age, severity of vaso-occlusive crisis, worsening anaemia and tubular dysfunction.",

OBJECTIVE: In this study, cardiac fibrosis and subclinical cardiac changes in children with sickle cell disease were evaluated using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), tissue Doppler echocardiography and serum galectin-3. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 34 children with sickle cell disease who were compared with a similar number of healthy controls. Cardiac MRI was used to evaluate late gadolinium enhancement, native T1 mapping, extracellular volume, and T2* for estimation of iron load. Cardiac function and myocardial performance index (MPI, evaluated by tissue Doppler echocardiography) and serum galectin-3 were compared to controls. RESULTS: The mean age of the included patients was 13.3 +- 3.2 years. Myocardial iron load by T2* was normal. The mean level of extracellular volume (35.41 +- 5.02%) was significantly associated with the frequency of vaso-occlusive crises (P = 0.017) and negatively correlated with hemoglobin levels (P = 0.005). Galectin-3 levels were significantly higher among cases than controls (P = 0.00), at a cutoff value on the receiver operating characteristic curve of 6.5 ng/ml, sensitivity of 82.5% and specificity of 72.8%.

It is a multisystemic condition with long-term renal complications. Early detection of sickle cell nephropathy and initiation of appropriate interventions are associated with improved survival and quality of life. This study aimed to compare the cystatin C-derived estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of the study groups and also, to correlate the clinical features of chronic kidney disease (CKD) with decreased GFR in children with sickle cell anaemia (SCA). METHODS: This hospital-based cross-sectional analytic study recruited 86 SCA subjects in steady-state and 86 age and sex-matched healthy HbAA controls aged 1-14 years who attended the Paediatric Haematology and Outpatient clinics of Federal Medical Centre Bida over six months. Data were collected using a semi-structured questionnaire, and participants' length/height, weight, and blood pressure were measured using standard procedures. Blood samples were drawn for serum cystatin C assay via the sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique. Filler's equation was used to calculate the glomerular filtration rate. RESULTS: There was a significant difference in the mean cystatin C-derived GFR between the two groups, i.e. 116 +- 30mL/min/1.73m2 vs. 106 +- 24mL/min/1.73m2 for the SCA and control groups, respectively (p = 0.017). The prevalence of supernormal GFR (i.e. GFR > 140mL/min/1.73m2) and decreased GFR (i.e. GFR < 90mL/min/1.73m2) was 19.8% and 22.1%, respectively, in children with SCA. There was no significant association between the age at diagnosis of SCA, blood transfusions, blood pressure, packed cell volume and presence of peripheral oedema with decreased GFR in the study subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Supernormal GFR is common in children with SCA and there is no significant association between clinical features of CKD with decreased GFR. Regular evaluation of renal function is, however, recommended in children with SCA for early detection and treatment of renal complications in order to halt the progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD).",

The SBP or DBP thresholds which maximized sensitivity and specificity were 120 mmHg SBP (sensitivity: 55.2%, specificity: 73.5%) and 70 mmHg DBP (sensitivity: 27.6%, specificity: 67.7%). The existing BP threshold of 140/90 mmHg lacked sensitivity in both genotype groups (HbSS/HbSbeta0 : SBP = 21% sensitive, DBP = 5.3% sensitive; HbSS/HbSbeta+ : SBP = 10% sensitive, DBP = 0% sensitive). Finally, percent change in SBP, DBP and MAP were all poor tests for identifying NWP. Existing BP thresholds used to diagnose hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are not sensitive for pregnant people with SCD. For this population, lowering the BP threshold that defines HDP may improve identification of those who need increased observation, consideration of early delivery and eclampsia prophylaxis.",

Whereas normalization of hemoglobin levels and hemolysis markers has been reported after HSCT, its effects on cerebral perfusion and oxygenation in adult SCD patients remain largely unexplored. This study investigated the effects of HSCT on cerebral blood flow (CBF), oxygen delivery, cerebrovascular reserve (CVR), oxygen extraction fraction (OEF), and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2 ) in 17 adult SCD patients (mean age: 25.0 +- 8.0, 6 females) before and after HSCT and 10 healthy ethnicity-matched controls (mean age: 28.0 +- 8.8, 6 females) using MRI. For the CVR assessment, perfusion scans were performed before and after acetazolamide as a vasodilatory stimulus. Following HSCT, gray and white matter (GM and WM) CBF decreased (p < .01), while GM and WM CVR increased (p < .01) compared with the baseline measures. OEF and CMRO2 also increased towards levels in healthy controls (p < .01). The normalization of cerebral perfusion and oxygen metabolism corresponded with a significant increase in hemoglobin levels and decreases in reticulocytes, total bilirubin, and LDH as markers of hemolysis (p < .01). This study shows that HSCT results in the normalization of cerebral perfusion and oxygen metabolism, even in adult patients with SCD.

Whereas normalization of hemoglobin levels and hemolysis markers has been reported after HSCT, its effects on cerebral perfusion and oxygenation in adult SCD patients remain largely unexplored. This study investigated the effects of HSCT on cerebral blood flow (CBF), oxygen delivery, cerebrovascular reserve (CVR), oxygen extraction fraction (OEF), and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2 ) in 17 adult SCD patients (mean age: 25.0 +- 8.0, 6 females) before and after HSCT and 10 healthy ethnicity-matched controls (mean age: 28.0 +- 8.8, 6 females) using MRI. For the CVR assessment, perfusion scans were performed before and after acetazolamide as a vasodilatory stimulus. Following HSCT, gray and white matter (GM and WM) CBF decreased (p < .01), while GM and WM CVR increased (p < .01) compared with the baseline measures. OEF and CMRO2 also increased towards levels in healthy controls (p < .01). The normalization of cerebral perfusion and oxygen metabolism corresponded with a significant increase in hemoglobin levels and decreases in reticulocytes, total bilirubin, and LDH as markers of hemolysis (p < .01).

Clinical management is elementary, and there is scant reliable data for many treatments. The onset of cerebrovascular illness and cognitive impairment are two of the major issues associated with sickle cell disease in children, and it is only now that researchers are beginning to understand how blood transfusions and hydroxycarbamide can prevent these complications.

This damage worsens with age. In our study, we focused on the specific pathways which are affected by the involvement of effected genes. Firstly, we retrieved the gene datasets from the publically available data source website DisGNET. Using literature-based genes, we identified 290 highly regulated genes that are directly associated with sickle cell disease. We subsequently performed a gene expression analysis and extracted a gene set using GEO2R analysis, which was then used to prune 290 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). After pruning we got 60 highly expressed genes. After identification of DEGs, we used these genes for pathway analysis. For the pathway analysis, we used Reactome software and we found that these DEGs are directly associated with 7 different pathways, which are alpha beta signaling pathways, 15 antiviral mechanism, Oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) antiviral response, interleukin 1 signaling pathways, interleukin 4 and 13, interleukin 10 signaling pathway, and aspirin ADME pathway. After pathway analysis, we can exactly relate how sickle cell disease alters the gene expression and how these genes affect the different pathways.

We subsequently performed a gene expression analysis and extracted a gene set using GEO2R analysis, which was then used to prune 290 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). After pruning we got 60 highly expressed genes. After identification of DEGs, we used these genes for pathway analysis. For the pathway analysis, we used Reactome software and we found that these DEGs are directly associated with 7 different pathways, which are alpha beta signaling pathways, 15 antiviral mechanism, Oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) antiviral response, interleukin 1 signaling pathways, interleukin 4 and 13, interleukin 10 signaling pathway, and aspirin ADME pathway. After pathway analysis, we can exactly relate how sickle cell disease alters the gene expression and how these genes affect the different pathways. Additionally, we performed gene ontology of 60 genes and identified the gene biological process, cellular component, and molecular functions as we mentioned in our results. With the help of our study data, there is a chance for pre-identification of sickle cell disease person. Our gene result was used as a biomarker of sickle cell disease.

A discrete-choice experiment (DCE) survey was developed in which respondents selected their preferred treatment alternatives in a series of experimentally-controlled pairs of hypothetical gene therapies and a \"no gene therapy\" option. Gene therapy alternatives were defined based on the chance of eliminating SCD symptoms, expected increases in life expectancy they could offer, treatment-related risk of death and potential increases in lifetime cancer risk. Respondents made selections based on their current disease severity and in the context of expectations of worsened disease. Three clinical sites and one patient organization recruited 174 adult patients and 109 parents of children with SCD to complete the survey. Adult and parent respondents were generally willing to choose gene therapies, but the adults required higher expected levels of efficacy (i.e., higher chance of eliminating symptoms) than parents to choose gene therapies that conferred mortality risks of 10% or more. When adults and parents of children with less severe symptoms were asked to consider scenarios of higher levels of disease severity, the risk tolerance increased, and the lowest acceptable level of efficacy for gene therapies with mortality risks dropped by more than 50%. Baseline SCD symptoms are a major driver of gene therapy acceptability. Adults and parents of patients with milder symptoms may prefer other treatment options; however, an expectation of symptoms deterioration triggers strong reassessment of the acceptable benefit-risk balance of this novel technology.",

Vaso-occlusion and chronic hemolysis lead to dysfunction to vital organ systems, with the kidneys being among the most commonly affected organs. SUMMARY: Early renal manifestations include medullary ischemia with loss of urine concentrating ability and hyperfiltration. This can be followed by progressive damage characterized by persistent albuminuria and a decline in the estimated glomerular filtration rate. The risk of sickle nephropathy is greater in those with the APOL1 G1 and G2 kidney risk variants and variants in HMOX1 and lower in those that co-inherit alpha-thalassemia. Therapies to treat sickle cell disease-related kidney damage focus on sickle cell disease modifying therapies (e.g. hydroxyurea) or those adopted from the non-sickle cell disease kidney literature (e.g. renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors), although data on their clinical efficacy are limited to small studies with short follow up periods. Kidney transplantation for end-stage kidney disease improves survival compared to hemodialysis but is underutilized in this patient population.

Brain ultrasound has already established as a cornerstone of daily practice in the management of the critically ill newborn for diagnosis and follow-up of the most common brain diseases, considering the easiness to insonate the brain through transfontanellar window. In critically ill children, doppler based techniques are used to assess cerebral hemodynamics in acute brain injury and recommended for screening patients suffering from sickle cell disease at risk for stroke. However, more evidence is needed regarding the accuracy of doppler based techniques for non-invasive estimation of cerebral perfusion pressure and intracranial pressure, as well as regarding the accuracy of brain ultrasound for diagnosis and monitoring of acute brain parenchyma alterations in children. This review is aimed at providing a comprehensive overview for clinicians of the technical, anatomical, and physiological basics for brain ultrasonography and transcranial doppler or color-coded doppler, and of the current status and future perspectives of their clinical applications in critically ill neonates and children. CONCLUSION: In critically ill neonates, brain ultrasound for diagnosis and follow-up of the most common cerebral pathologies of the neonatal period may be considered the standard of care. Data are needed about the possible role of doppler techniques for the assessment of cerebral perfusion and vasoreactivity of the critically ill neonate with open fontanelles.

WHAT IS KNOWN:   In critically ill neonates, brain ultrasound for early diagnosis and follow-up of the most common cerebral and neurovascular pathologies of the neonatal period is a cornerstone of daily practice. In critically ill children, doppler-based techniques are more routinely used to assess cerebral hemodynamics and autoregulation after acute brain injury and to screen patients at risk for vasospasm or stroke (e.g., sickle cell diseases, right-to-left shunts). WHAT IS NEW:   In critically ill neonates, research is currently focusing on the use of novel high frequency probes, even higher than 10 MHz, especially for extremely preterm babies. Furthermore, data are needed about the role of doppler based techniques for the assessment of cerebral perfusion and vasoreactivity of the critically ill neonate with open fontanelles, also integrated with a non-invasive assessment of brain oxygenation.

Brain ultrasound has already established as a cornerstone of daily practice in the management of the critically ill newborn for diagnosis and follow-up of the most common brain diseases, considering the easiness to insonate the brain through transfontanellar window. In critically ill children, doppler based techniques are used to assess cerebral hemodynamics in acute brain injury and recommended for screening patients suffering from sickle cell disease at risk for stroke. However, more evidence is needed regarding the accuracy of doppler based techniques for non-invasive estimation of cerebral perfusion pressure and intracranial pressure, as well as regarding the accuracy of brain ultrasound for diagnosis and monitoring of acute brain parenchyma alterations in children. This review is aimed at providing a comprehensive overview for clinicians of the technical, anatomical, and physiological basics for brain ultrasonography and transcranial doppler or color-coded doppler, and of the current status and future perspectives of their clinical applications in critically ill neonates and children. CONCLUSION: In critically ill neonates, brain ultrasound for diagnosis and follow-up of the most common cerebral pathologies of the neonatal period may be considered the standard of care. Data are needed about the possible role of doppler techniques for the assessment of cerebral perfusion and vasoreactivity of the critically ill neonate with open fontanelles. In pediatric critical care, doppler based techniques should be routinely adopted to assess and monitor cerebral hemodynamics. New technologies and more evidence are needed to improve the accuracy of brain ultrasound for the assessment of brain parenchyma of critically ill children with fibrous fontanelles. WHAT IS KNOWN:   In critically ill neonates, brain ultrasound for early diagnosis and follow-up of the most common cerebral and neurovascular pathologies of the neonatal period is a cornerstone of daily practice. In critically ill children, doppler-based techniques are more routinely used to assess cerebral hemodynamics and autoregulation after acute brain injury and to screen patients at risk for vasospasm or stroke (e.g., sickle cell diseases, right-to-left shunts). WHAT IS NEW:   In critically ill neonates, research is currently focusing on the use of novel high frequency probes, even higher than 10 MHz, especially for extremely preterm babies. Furthermore, data are needed about the role of doppler based techniques for the assessment of cerebral perfusion and vasoreactivity of the critically ill neonate with open fontanelles, also integrated with a non-invasive assessment of brain oxygenation. In pediatric critical care, new technologies should be developed to improve the accuracy of brain ultrasound for the assessment of brain parenchyma of critically ill children with fibrous fontanelles.

In the PEN-Plus model, mid-level clinicians in intermediary facilities in low and lower middle income countries are trained to provide integrated care for conditions where services traditionally were only available at tertiary referral facilities. For the upcoming phase of activities, 18 first-level hospitals in 9 countries and 1 state in India were selected for PEN-Plus expansion and will treat a variety of severe NCDs. Over 3 years, the countries and state are expected to: (1) establish PEN-Plus clinics in one or two district hospitals, (2) support these clinics to mature into training sites in preparation for national or state-level scale-up, and (3) work with the national or state-level stakeholders to describe, measure and advocate for PEN-Plus to support development of a national operational plan for scale-up. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Guided by Proctor outcomes for implementation research, we are conducting a mixed-method evaluation consisting of 10 components to understand outcomes in clinical implementation, training and policy development. Data will be collected through a mix of quantitative surveys, routine reporting, routine clinical data and qualitative interviews. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This protocol has been considered exempt or covered by central and local institutional review boards. Findings will be disseminated throughout the project's course, including through quarterly M&E discussions, semiannual formative assessments, dashboard mapping of progress, quarterly newsletters, regular feedback loops with national stakeholders and publication in peer-reviewed journals.",

In high-throughput newborn screening (NBS) for SCD, a two-step procedure is suitable, in which qPCR first pre-selects relevant samples that are differentiated by a second method. METHODS: Three NBS centers using qPCR-based primary screening for SCD performed a laboratory comparison. Methods using tandem MS or HPLC were used for differentiation. RESULTS: In a benchmarking test, 450 dried blood samples were analyzed. Samples containing HbS were detected as reliably by qPCR as by methods established for hemoglobinopathy testing. In a two-step screening approach, the 2nd-tier-analyses have to distinguish the carrier status from pathological variants. In nine months of regular screening, a total of 353,219 samples were analyzed using two-stage NBS procedures. The 1st-tier screening by qPCR reduced the number of samples for subsequent differentiation by>99.5%. Cases with carrier status or other variants were identified as inconspicuous while 78 cases with SCD were revealed. The derived incidence of 1:4,773, is in good agreement with previously published incidences. CONCLUSION: In high-throughput NBS for SCD, qPCR is suitable to focus 2nd-tier analyses on samples containing HbS, while being unaffected by factors such as prematurity or transfusions. The substantial reduction of samples numbers positively impacts resource conservation, sustainability, and cost-effectiveness. No false negative cases came to attention.",

A 17-year-oldfemale patient who was a known case of sickle cell disease presented to our institution with a vascular necrosis of the right femoral head. Due to the pain and limitations of her day-to-day activities, she was advised for total hip arthroplasty. This patient underwent a successful Erythrocytapheresis using an automated cell separator and was operated on. In a sickle cell patient planned for surgical intervention, the procedure of Erythrocytapheresis can help in decreasing the chances of the patient developing any vaso-occlusive crisis during surgery and in the immediate post-operative period. This technique can help in improving the chances of a successful surgical procedure for such patients.",

Although blood transfusion is the gold standard for stroke prevention in SCD, the biological mechanisms underpinning its improved efficacy compared to hydroxycarbamide are not fully understood. We hypothesized that the improved clinical efficacy of blood transfusion might relate to differences in endothelial cell activation and VWF-ADAMTS13 axis dysfunction. One-hundred-eighty children with a confirmed diagnosis of SCD (HbSS) on hydroxycarbamide (n=96) or blood transfusion (n=84) were included. Despite disease-modifying treatment, plasma VWF and VWF propeptide were elevated in a significant proportion of SCD children (33% and 47% respectively). Crucially, all VWF parameters were significantly higher in the hydroxycarbamide compared to the blood transfusion cohort (p<0.05). Additionally, increased levels of other Weibel-Palade-body-stored proteins, including factor VIII (FVIII), angiopoietin-2, and osteoprotegerin were observed, indicated ongoing endothelial cell activation. Children treated with hydroxycarbamide also had higher FVIII activity and enhanced thrombin generation compared to the blood transfusion cohort (p<0.001), contributing to their thrombotic risk. Finally, hemolysis markers strongly correlated with VWF levels (p<0.001) and significantly reduced in the blood transfusion cohort (p<0.001). Cumulatively, our findings demonstrate for the first time that despite treatment, ongoing dysfunction of the VWF-ADAMTS13 axis is present in a significant sub-group of pediatric SCD patients, especially those treated with hydroxycarbamide. Since VWF plays an important role in vaso-occlusion pathogenesis, these data are of direct translational relevance.",

METHODS: During a 14-month period, 2562 heel prick blood samples, taken on filter paper from Akdeniz University Hospital, Antalya Education and Research Hospital and Antalya Ataturk State Hospital and four other healthcare centers, were studied using the high pressure liquid chromatography method. Blood samples were studied using the `Sickle Cell Short Program` test method on a Bio Rad Variant device. RESULTS: In the study, no patients with sickle cell disease were identified. Four newborns who were sickle cell carriers (0.15%) and two newborns who were Hemoglobin D carriers (0.08 %), were found. CONCLUSION: Considering the efficiency and cost calculations made as a result of the data obtained from our study, it was concluded that sickle cell screening would not be effective in newborns. It seems more effective and economical to screen the children of parents, who are found to be at risk for Hemoglobin S carriage as a result of premarital tests.",

In this review, we present multiple several conditions that may present as skull lesions or pseudolesions, organized by groups (anatomic variants, congenital and development disorders, traumatic injuries, vascular issues, infectious conditions, and tumoral processes). Anatomic variants are common imaging findings that must be recognized by the neuroradiologist. Congenital malformations are rare conditions, such as aplasia cutis congenita and sinus pericranii, usually seen at earlier ages, the majority of which are benign findings. In case of trauma, cephalohematoma, growing skull fractures, and posttraumatic lytic lesions should be considered. Osteomyelitis tends to be locally aggressive and may mimic malignancy, in which cases, the clinical history can be the key to diagnosis. Vascular (sickle cell disease) and tumoral (aneurismal bone cyst, eosinophilic granuloma, metastases) lesions are relatively rare lesions but should be considered in the differential diagnosis, in the presence of certain imaging findings. The main difficulty is the differentiation between the benign and malignant nature; therefore, the main objective of this pictorial essay is to review the main skull lytic lesions found in pediatric age, describing the main findings in different imaging modalities (CT and MRI), allowing the neuroradiologist greater confidence in establishing the differential diagnosis, through a systematic and simple characterization of the lesions.",

                    "text": "The influence of body mass index on airway resistance in children with sickle cell disease: A longitudinal study based on impulse oscillometry.BACKGROUND: Impulse oscillometry (IOS) is an effective tool for assessing airway mechanics and diagnosing obstructive airway disease (OAD) in children with sickle cell disease (C-SCD). Obesity is known to be associated with OAD, and untreated OAD often leads to hypoxia-related complications in C-SCD. Considering the increasing prevalence of obesity in C-SCD, it is important to explore the influence of body mass index (BMI) on OAD in this disease population. METHODS: A longitudinal retrospective chart review was conducted on 55 C-SCD (161 IOS observations) and 35 non-SCD asthmatic children (C-Asthma) (58 observations), primarily to investigate the association between BMI and airway resistance in C-SCD and C-Asthma. We conducted generalized linear mixed models (GLMM), adjusted for pharmacotherapies, to demonstrate the influence of BMI on total (R5), central (R20), and peripheral (R5-20) airway resistance and reactance (X5, resonant frequency (Fres)). We further compared age, BMI, and IOS indices between C-SCD and C-Asthma using the Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: Age and BMI were not statistically different between the two groups. In C-SCD, BMI was associated with R5 (GLMM t-statistics:3.75, 95%CI:1.01,3.27, p-value<0.001*) and R20 (t-statistics:4.01, 95%CI:1.04,1.15, p-value<0.001*), but not with R5-20 or airway reactance. In asthmatics, BMI was not associated with IOS estimates except Fres (t-statistics: 3.93, 95%CI: -0.06, -0.02, p-value<0.001*). C-SCD demonstrated higher airway resistances (R5 and R20) and reactance (Fres) compared to C-Asthma (Mann-Whitney: p-values<0.05). CONCLUSION: BMI significantly influenced total and central airway resistance in C-SCD. While higher airway resistances reflected increased OAD in C-SCD than asthmatics, higher Fres perhaps indicated progressive pulmonary involvement in C-SCD.",

Obesity is known to be associated with OAD, and untreated OAD often leads to hypoxia-related complications in C-SCD. Considering the increasing prevalence of obesity in C-SCD, it is important to explore the influence of body mass index (BMI) on OAD in this disease population. METHODS: A longitudinal retrospective chart review was conducted on 55 C-SCD (161 IOS observations) and 35 non-SCD asthmatic children (C-Asthma) (58 observations), primarily to investigate the association between BMI and airway resistance in C-SCD and C-Asthma. We conducted generalized linear mixed models (GLMM), adjusted for pharmacotherapies, to demonstrate the influence of BMI on total (R5), central (R20), and peripheral (R5-20) airway resistance and reactance (X5, resonant frequency (Fres)). We further compared age, BMI, and IOS indices between C-SCD and C-Asthma using the Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: Age and BMI were not statistically different between the two groups. In C-SCD, BMI was associated with R5 (GLMM t-statistics:3.75, 95%CI:1.01,3.27, p-value<0.001*) and R20 (t-statistics:4.01, 95%CI:1.04,1.15, p-value<0.001*), but not with R5-20 or airway reactance. In asthmatics, BMI was not associated with IOS estimates except Fres (t-statistics: 3.93, 95%CI: -0.06, -0.02, p-value<0.001*). C-SCD demonstrated higher airway resistances (R5 and R20) and reactance (Fres) compared to C-Asthma (Mann-Whitney: p-values<0.05). CONCLUSION: BMI significantly influenced total and central airway resistance in C-SCD. While higher airway resistances reflected increased OAD in C-SCD than asthmatics, higher Fres perhaps indicated progressive pulmonary involvement in C-SCD.",

The latter revealed that b-globin promoter-driven designs for monotherapy with <i>HBB<sup>IVSI-110(G>A)</sup></i>-specific shRNAmiRs only marginally increased b-globin levels compared to untransduced cells, whereas bifunctional LVs combining miR30-shRNA with b<sup>AS3</sup>-globin expression showed disease correction similar to that achieved by the parental GLV2-bAS3 vector. Our results establish the feasibility of high titers for LVs containing the full <i>HBB</i> transcription terminator, emphasize the importance of the <i>HBB</i> terminator for the high-level expression of <i>HBB</i>-like transgenes, qualify the therapeutic utility of late-erythroid <i>HBB<sup>IVSI-110(G>A)</sup></i>-specific miR30-shRNA expression and highlight the exceptional potential of GLV2-bAS3 for the treatment of severe b-hemoglobinopathies.",

The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of bone fragility in sickle cell patients and to evaluate the potential risk factors and associated complications. METHODS: We conducted a single-center cross-sectional study. Bone mineral densitometry (BMD) at the lumbar spine and the hip, Vertebral Fracture Assessment (VFA) and biological measurements were performed in patients aged between 20 and 40 years. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-eight patients with sickle cell disease were included between June 2020 and December 2021. One hundred and one patients (73.2 %) were from Sub-Saharan Africa, 13 from North Africa (9.4 %), 11 from the Caribbean (7.9 %), 6 from the Indian Ocean. A Z-score < -2 was found in 43 patients (31.2 %) at the lumbar spine, in 4 patients (3 %) at the total hip, and in 5 patients (3.7 %) at the femoral neck. 59 patients (46.8 %) had vertebral deformities. Fragility fractures were recorded in 9 patients (10.8 %). Patients with low BMD had lower BMI (21.3 (19.0, 24.0) versus 24.0 (20.7, 26.1) Kg/m2, p = 0.003), lower osteonecrosis history (7 % versus 25.3 %, p = 0.011) and lower hemoglobin levels (9.0 (8.0, 10.0) versus 10.0 (9.0, 11.0) g/dL, p < 0.01).

It is unclear whether concurrent cholecystectomy increases length of stay or morbidity after splenectomy. The purpose of this study was to compare morbidity among children undergoing laparoscopic splenectomy alone versus splenectomy with concurrent cholecystectomy in patients with hemolytic anemia. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated children with hemolytic anemia undergoing non-traumatic laparoscopic splenectomy in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program-Pediatric database (2012-2020). Outcomes were compared for patients undergoing splenectomy alone (n = 1010) versus splenectomy with cholecystectomy (n = 371). Pearson's Chi-square and Student's t-tests were utilized as appropriate. Propensity score-matching was completed, controlling for eight demographic and clinical variables. RESULTS: 1381 patients were identified, 73.1% undergoing splenectomy alone and 26.9% splenectomy with cholecystectomy. Splenectomy with cholecystectomy patients were older (10.9 years vs. 8.4 years, p < 0.01), more likely to have hereditary spherocytosis (56.1% vs. 40.8%, p < 0.01), less likely to have sickle cell disease (12.1% vs. 33.5%, p < 0.01), more likely ASA class 1 or 2 (49.3% vs. 42.1%, p < 0.01), and had similar preoperative hematocrit levels (29.6 vs. 29.3, p = 0.33). The splenectomy with cholecystectomy group was less likely to receive preoperative blood transfusions (13.5% vs. 25.4%, p < 0.01). There were 360 pairs selected on propensity score-matching, and splenectomy with cholecystectomy was associated with increased operative time (182 min vs. 145 min, p < 0.01) and decreased occurrences of a postoperative transfusion (4.2% vs. 8.9%, p = 0.01). Length of stay after surgery (2.5 days vs. 2.3 days, p = 0.13), composite morbidity (3.9% vs. 3.4%, p = 0.69), and 30-day readmission rates (3.3% vs. 7.4%, p = 0.08) were all similar. CONCLUSIONS: Splenectomy with cholecystectomy is associated with similar postoperative morbidity, length of stay and readmission rates compared to splenectomy alone.

DESIGN: A retrospective consecutive series. SUBJECTS: Children with SCD aged 18 years old or less who had an ophthalmic exam at Boston Children's Hospital between January 1998 and August 2022. METHODS: Qualitative and quantitative analyses of both optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography (OCTA) images were performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Total retinal thickness measured on macular OCT, as well as superficial capillary plexus (SCP) and deep capillary plexus (DCP) vessel density (VD), and foveal avascular zone (FAZ) area measured on 6 x 6 mm OCTA scans. RESULTS: ICD-10 code search identified 303 pediatric SCD patients who underwent ophthalmic exam during the study period. OCT and OCTA images were acquired on 104 (17.2%) and 60 (9.9%) eyes at presentation and on 159 (26.2%) and 100 (16.5%) eyes at final visit. Overall, temporal retinal thinning was noted qualitatively in 35.6% of SCD patients at presentation and 39.6% at final visit. Of those patients with macular thinning, 94.6% and 90.5% had peripheral sickle cell retinopathy (SCR) at presentation and final visit. On quantitative OCT analysis, HbSS eyes had a lower retinal thickness in the fovea and temporal parafovea compared with HbSC, P < 0.05. Eyes with peripheral SCR had a larger FAZ at presentation compared to eyes without peripheral SCR (P = 0.004), a lower DCP VD at final visit in the inferior temporal macula (P = 0.03), and a higher DCP VD at final visit in the superior nasal macula (P = 0.01). 80 eyes of 40 patients had OCT and 34 eyes of 20 patients had both OCT and OCTA images acquired at both initial and final visits. At final visit, retinal thickness decreased at the fovea, inferior perifovea, and temporal perifovea compared to presentation, P < 0.05. In parallel, VD DCP in the superonasal quadrant increased at final visit, P = 0.03. CONCLUSIONS: Macular retinal thinning was progressive and observed in eyes with and without peripheral SCR. Over time, there was a compensatory increase in DCP VD in the nasal macula on OCTA.",

On quantitative OCT analysis, HbSS eyes had a lower retinal thickness in the fovea and temporal parafovea compared with HbSC, P < 0.05. Eyes with peripheral SCR had a larger FAZ at presentation compared to eyes without peripheral SCR (P = 0.004), a lower DCP VD at final visit in the inferior temporal macula (P = 0.03), and a higher DCP VD at final visit in the superior nasal macula (P = 0.01). 80 eyes of 40 patients had OCT and 34 eyes of 20 patients had both OCT and OCTA images acquired at both initial and final visits. At final visit, retinal thickness decreased at the fovea, inferior perifovea, and temporal perifovea compared to presentation, P < 0.05. In parallel, VD DCP in the superonasal quadrant increased at final visit, P = 0.03. CONCLUSIONS: Macular retinal thinning was progressive and observed in eyes with and without peripheral SCR. Over time, there was a compensatory increase in DCP VD in the nasal macula on OCTA.",

DESIGN: A retrospective consecutive series. SUBJECTS: Children with SCD aged 18 years old or less who had an ophthalmic exam at Boston Children's Hospital between January 1998 and August 2022. METHODS: Qualitative and quantitative analyses of both optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography (OCTA) images were performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Total retinal thickness measured on macular OCT, as well as superficial capillary plexus (SCP) and deep capillary plexus (DCP) vessel density (VD), and foveal avascular zone (FAZ) area measured on 6 x 6 mm OCTA scans. RESULTS: ICD-10 code search identified 303 pediatric SCD patients who underwent ophthalmic exam during the study period. OCT and OCTA images were acquired on 104 (17.2%) and 60 (9.9%) eyes at presentation and on 159 (26.2%) and 100 (16.5%) eyes at final visit. Overall, temporal retinal thinning was noted qualitatively in 35.6% of SCD patients at presentation and 39.6% at final visit.

We aimed to evaluate modifiable stroke risk factors in children undergoing surgical revascularization for moyamoya. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this exploratory, single-center, retrospective cohort study, medical records of pediatric patients undergoing surgical revascularization for moyamoya arteriopathy at our center between 2003 and 2021 were reviewed. Candidate modifiable risk factors were analyzed for association with perioperative stroke, defined as ischemic stroke <=7 days after surgery. RESULTS: We analyzed 53 surgeries, consisting of 39 individual patients undergoing indirect surgical revascularization of 74 hemispheres. Perioperative ischemic stroke occurred following five surgeries (9.4%). There were no instances of hemorrhagic stroke. Larger pre-to-postoperative decreases in hemoglobin (OR 3.90, p=0.017), hematocrit (OR 1.69, p=0.012) and blood urea nitrogen (OR 1.83, p=0.010) were associated with increased risk of perioperative ischemic stroke. Weight-adjusted intraoperative blood loss was not associated with risk of perioperative ischemic stroke (OR 0.94, p=0.796). Among children with sickle cell disease, all of whom underwent exchange transfusion within one week prior to surgery, none experienced perioperative stroke. CONCLUSIONS: Decreases in hemoglobin, hematocrit, and blood urea nitrogen between the preoperative and postoperative periods are associated with increased risk of perioperative stroke. These novel findings suggest that dilutional anemia, possibly due to standardly administered hyperhydration, may increase the risk of perioperative stroke in some children with moyamoya.

We aimed to evaluate modifiable stroke risk factors in children undergoing surgical revascularization for moyamoya. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this exploratory, single-center, retrospective cohort study, medical records of pediatric patients undergoing surgical revascularization for moyamoya arteriopathy at our center between 2003 and 2021 were reviewed. Candidate modifiable risk factors were analyzed for association with perioperative stroke, defined as ischemic stroke <=7 days after surgery. RESULTS: We analyzed 53 surgeries, consisting of 39 individual patients undergoing indirect surgical revascularization of 74 hemispheres. Perioperative ischemic stroke occurred following five surgeries (9.4%). There were no instances of hemorrhagic stroke. Larger pre-to-postoperative decreases in hemoglobin (OR 3.90, p=0.017), hematocrit (OR 1.69, p=0.012) and blood urea nitrogen (OR 1.83, p=0.010) were associated with increased risk of perioperative ischemic stroke. Weight-adjusted intraoperative blood loss was not associated with risk of perioperative ischemic stroke (OR 0.94, p=0.796). Among children with sickle cell disease, all of whom underwent exchange transfusion within one week prior to surgery, none experienced perioperative stroke. CONCLUSIONS: Decreases in hemoglobin, hematocrit, and blood urea nitrogen between the preoperative and postoperative periods are associated with increased risk of perioperative stroke. These novel findings suggest that dilutional anemia, possibly due to standardly administered hyperhydration, may increase the risk of perioperative stroke in some children with moyamoya. Further work optimizing both mean arterial pressure and oxygen-carrying capacity in these patients, including consideration of alternative blood transfusion thresholds, is necessary.",

During an exchange, some of the patient's abnormal hemoglobin (Hb) S (HbS) RBCs are removed. An apheresis device can accomplish an automated RBC exchange, simultaneously removing patient's RBCs while returning other blood components along with normal RBCs. Automated RBC exchange is therefore an isovolemic transfusion that can efficiently decrease HbS RBCs while limiting iron loading and hyperviscosity. However, specialized equipment, trained personnel, appropriate vascular access, and increased RBC exposure are required compared to simple or manual RBC exchange. Therefore, risks and benefits must be balanced to make individualized decisions for patients with SCD who require transfusion.",

RESULTS: Eleven SCD patients underwent 109 EAT procedures (1-59 procedures per patient). The median age was 42 years (IQR = [30-49]) and 82% (n = 9) were female. Most (82%; n = 9) patients had severe chronic kidney disease and 55% (n = 6) had heart failure. One (9%) patient had a history of life-threatening TACO.

PROCEDURE: We conducted a literature-based assessment of busulfan and subsequent late effects, with emphasis on secondary malignancies, identifying publications via PubMed searches, and selecting those reporting at least 3 years of follow-up. RESULTS: We identified eight pediatric and 13 adult publications describing long-term follow-up in 570 pediatric and 2076 adult hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients.

Results: Forty-nine adult patients with SCD who were diagnosed with AVN were studied. The median age of the study population is 32 years, and the median age at the first AVN diagnosis was 26 years (range: 11-44 yr.). 37 (75.5%) patients suffered from multiple joints AVN while 12(24.5%) had single joint involvement. 31 (63.3%) patients had bilateral hip AVN and 18 (36.7%) had shoulder involvement. 30 patients (61%) were on Hydroxyurea treatment. Based on FICAT and Alert classification of AVN, 57 % of patients had stage III and above at first diagnosis. 20 (40.8%) were managed with a conservative approach, 11 (22.4%) received hyperbaric oxygen with good response, 6(12.2%) underwent hip core decompression and 12(24.5%) underwent hip replacement surgery.

Results: Forty-nine adult patients with SCD who were diagnosed with AVN were studied. The median age of the study population is 32 years, and the median age at the first AVN diagnosis was 26 years (range: 11-44 yr.). 37 (75.5%) patients suffered from multiple joints AVN while 12(24.5%) had single joint involvement. 31 (63.3%) patients had bilateral hip AVN and 18 (36.7%) had shoulder involvement. 30 patients (61%) were on Hydroxyurea treatment. Based on FICAT and Alert classification of AVN, 57 % of patients had stage III and above at first diagnosis. 20 (40.8%) were managed with a conservative approach, 11 (22.4%) received hyperbaric oxygen with good response, 6(12.2%) underwent hip core decompression and 12(24.5%) underwent hip replacement surgery.

A Retrospective Study.Background and Objectives: Pain management poses a significant challenge for patients experiencing vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) in sickle cell disease (SCD). While opioid therapy is highly effective, its efficacy can be impeded by undesirable side effects. Local regional anesthesia (LRA), involving the deposition of a perineural anesthetic, provides a nociceptive blockade, local vasodilation and reduces the inflammatory response. However, the effectiveness of this therapeutic approach for VOC in SCD patients has been rarely reported up to now. The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a single-shot local regional anesthesia (LRA) in reducing pain and consequently enhancing the management of severe vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) in adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) unresponsive to conventional analgesic therapy. Materials and Methods: We first collected consecutive episodes of VOC in critical care (ICU and emergency room) for six months in 2022 in a French University hospital with a large population of sickle cell patients in the West Indies population. We also performed a systematic review of the use of LRA in SCD. The primary outcome was defined using a numeric pain score (NPS) and/or percentage of change in opioid use. Results: We enrolled nine SCD adults (28 years old, 4 females) for ten episodes of VOC in whom LRA was used for pain management. Opioid reduction within the first 24 h post block was -75% (50 to 96%). Similarly, the NPS decreased from 9/10 pre-block to 0-1/10 post-block. Five studies, including one case series with three patients and four case reports, employed peripheral nerve blocks for regional anesthesia. In general, local regional anesthesia (LRA) exhibited a reduction in pain and symptoms, along with a decrease in opioid consumption post-procedure. Conclusions: LRA improves pain scores, reduces opioid consumption in SCD patients with refractory pain, and may mitigate opioid-related side effects while facilitating the transition to oral analgesics. Furthermore, LRA is a safe and effective procedure.",

Recent Nigerian studies have reported a declining trend in the age of sexual maturation and menarche in haemoglobin AA (HbAA) individuals. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the sexual maturation of female patients with SCA aged 10 to 19 years seen at Lagos University Teaching Hospital Idi-Araba, Lagos and Sickle Cell Foundation. METHODS: It was a cross-sectional study involving 140 girls with SCA (subjects) and an equal number of girls with HbAA (controls) who were matched for age and socio-economic class over a fivemonth period. The evaluation involved anthropometry, calculation of BMI and determination of breast and pubic hair development using Tanner staging. RESULTS: The mean BMI for the subjects was 17.2+-2.39 kg/m2and 20.2+-3.09 kg/m2 for the controls (p < 0.001). The mean age at onset of breast development (B2) was 13 +- 0.39 years in the subjects and 10.5 +- 0.51 years in the controls (p < 0.001). The corresponding mean age for pubic hair development (PH2) was also higher at 13.8 +- 0.59 years for the girls with SCA and 10.4 +- 0.51 years for the controls (p <0.001), while menarche was achieved in the subjects at 14.7 +- 1.68 years and in the controls at 12.3 +- 1.33 years (p < 0.001).

                    "text": "Sexual Maturation of Female Adolescent Patients with Sickle Cell Anaemia in Lagos, Nigeria.BACKGROUND: Sickle cell anaemia (SCA) has been shown to have adverse effects on growth and sexual development. Recent Nigerian studies have reported a declining trend in the age of sexual maturation and menarche in haemoglobin AA (HbAA) individuals. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the sexual maturation of female patients with SCA aged 10 to 19 years seen at Lagos University Teaching Hospital Idi-Araba, Lagos and Sickle Cell Foundation. METHODS: It was a cross-sectional study involving 140 girls with SCA (subjects) and an equal number of girls with HbAA (controls) who were matched for age and socio-economic class over a fivemonth period. The evaluation involved anthropometry, calculation of BMI and determination of breast and pubic hair development using Tanner staging. RESULTS: The mean BMI for the subjects was 17.2+-2.39 kg/m2and 20.2+-3.09 kg/m2 for the controls (p < 0.001). The mean age at onset of breast development (B2) was 13 +- 0.39 years in the subjects and 10.5 +- 0.51 years in the controls (p < 0.001). The corresponding mean age for pubic hair development (PH2) was also higher at 13.8 +- 0.59 years for the girls with SCA and 10.4 +- 0.51 years for the controls (p <0.001), while menarche was achieved in the subjects at 14.7 +- 1.68 years and in the controls at 12.3 +- 1.33 years (p < 0.001). Upper socioeconomic class was associated with earlier menarche and faster transition from pre-pubertal stage to pubertal stage of sexual maturation in the controls but was not observed in the SCA subjects. CONCLUSION: Sexual maturity in patients with SCA lagged behind those of the HbAA controls.",

This meta-analysis included 21 studies. Sickle cell disease (SCD) was a risk factor for mortality (pooled ES = 1.70, 95% CI: 1.00-2.92, p = 0.001), hospitalization (pooled ES = 6.21, 95% CI: 3.60-10.70, p = 0.000) and intensive care unit (ICU) admission (pooled ES = 2.29, 95% CI: 1.61-3.24, p = 0.099) in COVID-19 patients. Patients with SCD had an increased risk of respiratory failure/mechanical ventilation, but a statistical association was not found (pooled ES = 1.21, 95%CI: 0.74-1.98, p = 0.036). There was significant heterogeneity between SCD and death, hospitalization, and respiratory failure/mechanical ventilation.

We tested the hypothesis in adults with SCD that cerebral blood flow (CBF), oxygen extraction fraction (OEF), and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) measured using MRI, normalized to healthy values, comparing measurements approximately one month before to 12-24 months following HSCT (n=11; age=33.3+-8.9 years; 389+-150 days post-HSCT) to age-, race- and sex-matched values from healthy adults without sickle trait (n=28; age=30.2+-5.6 years).

All received haploBMT from first-degree relatives (parent, sibling, or child donor) with reduced-intensity preparation and maintained engraftment. Pre-transplant, CBF was elevated (CBF=69.11 24.7 ml/100g/min) compared to controls (p = 0.004).

We examined the relationship between IVF therapy and hospital length of stay (HLOS), as well as adverse events, such as acute chest syndrome (ACS), pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) transfer, and 28-day re-admission. METHODS: This is a single-center retrospective analysis of SCD VOE hospitalizations between January 2015 and April 2020. Patients with SCD, age 0-30, with consecutive hospitalizations for VOE were included. For the first 3 days of each admission, an \"IVF ratio\" was calculated by dividing actual IVF rate administered by weight-based maintenance IVF (mIVF) rate. RESULTS: A total of 617 hospitalizations for 161 patients were included. Mean HLOS was 5.7 days, (SD 3.9), and mean IVF volume over the first 3 days of admission was 139.6 mL/kg/day (SD 57.8). Multivariate analysis showed that for each additional 0.5 times the mIVF rate, HLOS increased by 0.53 day (p < .001; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.609-0.989), but there was no significant association between IVF therapy and adverse events. History of chronic pain was associated with increased odds of re-admission (OR 6.4; 95% CI: 3.93-10.52). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the theoretical potential for IVF therapy to slow down the sickling process, our findings suggest that increased IVF therapy was associated with prolonged HLOS, which places a burden on patients, families, and the health system.",

Despite prophylactic serological matching for ABO, Rh, and K, red cell alloimmunization persists, in part, due to a high frequency of variant RH alleles in patients with SCD and Black blood donors. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We compared RH genotypes and rates of alloimmunization in 342 pediatric and young adult patients with SCD on chronic transfusion therapy exposed to >90,000 red cell units at five sites across the USA. Genotyping was performed with RHD and RHCE BeadChip arrays and targeted assays. RESULTS: Prevalence of overall and Rh-specific alloimmunization varied among institutions, ranging from 5% to 41% (p = .0035) and 5%-33% (p = .0002), respectively. RH genotyping demonstrated that 33% RHD and 57% RHCE alleles were variant in this cohort. Patients with RHCE alleles encoding partial e antigens had higher rates of anti-e identified than those encoding at least one conventional e antigen (p = .0007). There was no difference in anti-D, anti-C, or anti-E formation among patients with predicted partial or altered antigen expression compared to those with conventional antigens, suggesting that variant Rh on donor cells may also stimulate alloimmunization to these antigens. DISCUSSION: These results highlight variability in alloimmunization rates and suggest that a molecular approach to Rh antigen matching may be necessary for optimal prevention of alloimmunization given the high prevalence of variant RH alleles among both patients and Black donors.",

The objective of this study was to examine the consistency of International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code documentation for SCD/SCT and identify coding discrepancies between patients' hospitalizations. PATIENTS: A total of 80 031 hospitalization records across 528 hospitals belonging to 15 380 unique patients who had at least 1 documentation of SCD/SCT and 2 or more hospitalizations during the study period (April 2015-December 2016). METHODS: Secondary analysis of patient discharge abstracts in California, Florida, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. ICD 9 and ICD 10 codes identified patients with SCD/SCT. Variations in documentation consistency across hospitals were examined. RESULTS: Only 51% of patients were consistently documented. There were statistically significant differences in whether a patient was or was not consistently documented based on: age, race/ethnicity, sex, insurer, and disease type. Twenty-five percent of hospitalization records were not consistently documented with an SCD code. Hospitalization records, for patients not consistently documented (49%), often included primary admitting diagnoses for conditions associated with SCD. Few hospitals (18%) were above average in consistently documenting SCD/SCT. CONCLUSIONS: Not consistent documentation for SCD/SCT occurs with variation among patients and across disease type and hospitals. These findings signal to researchers the importance of thoroughly identifying all hospitalizations when studying populations with chronic disease. Without accurate documentation, research relying on claims data may produce inaccurate findings.",

A shared transfusion resource has decreased both in other countries, while in the United States cost concerns persist. We conducted a Markov cohort simulation of a birth cohort of alloimmunized patients with SCD to estimate lifetime DHTR incidence, DHTR-specific mortality, quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE), and costs with the implementation of a shared transfusion resource to identify antibody history versus without (i.e., status quo). We conducted our analysis using a lifetime analytic time horizon and from a United States health system perspective. Implementation of shared transfusion resource projects to decrease cumulative DHTR-specific mortality by 26% for alloimmunized patients with SCD in the United States, relative to the status quo. For an average patient population of 32 000, this intervention would generate a discounted increment of 4000 QALYs at an incremental discounted cost of $0.3 billion, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $75 600/QALY [95% credible interval $70 200-81 400/QALY]. The results are most sensitive to the baseline lifetime medical expenditure of patients with SCD. Alloantibody data exchange is cost-effective in 100% of 10 000 Monte Carlo simulations. The resource would theoretically need a minimum patient population of 1819 patients or cost no more than $5.29 million annually to be cost-effective. By reducing DHTR-specific mortality, a shared transfusion resource in the United States projects to be a life-saving and cost-effective intervention for patients with SCD in the United States.",

Despite advancements in SCA care management, understanding the long-term impact on organs during steady state has remained inconclusive. AIM: This study aimed to investigate the long-term changes in intra-abdominal organs of SCA children compared with non-SCA children during steady state using two-dimensional ultrasound assessment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 116 children (58 SCA and 58 controls) were enrolled between June 2021 and July 2022. Clinico-demographic data were collected through an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Two-dimensional ultrasound was used to measure the liver, spleen, kidneys, and inferior vena cava in all subjects. Age-matched controls had AA or AS genotypes. RESULTS: Of the 58 patients with SCA, 65.5% were males with an overall mean age of 8.1   3.4 years, while among the non-SCA cohort (n = 58), 48.3% were males with an overall mean age of 8.7   3.9 years. There was no statistically significant difference in the age and gender distribution between the SCA and non-SCA cohorts (P = 0.390 and P = 0.091, respectively).

Quantitative sensory testing is an important measurement tool for understanding pain and sensory processing. This scoping review summarizes quantitative sensory testing methodologies used in sickle cell studies and the evidence for central sensitization in this population. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL to identify studies using quantitative sensory testing in individuals living with sickle cell disease. Search strategies were based on variations of the terms \"sickle cell disease,\" and \"quantitative sensory testing.\" Eligible studies were observational or experimental studies in human participants living with SCD that reported findings and detailed methodology for at least one quantitative sensory testing modality. RESULTS: Our search yielded a total of 274 records; 27 of which are included in this scoping review. Of the 27 studies, 17 were original studies (with combined total of 516 adult and 298 pediatric participants) and 10 were secondary or subgroup analyses of these prior studies. Significant variation existed in quantitative sensory testing methodologies across studies, including testing locations, type and intensity of stimuli, and interpretation of findings. Of the identified studies, 22% (2/9 studies) reported sensory abnormalities in mechanical sensitivity and thresholds, 22% (2/9 studies) reported abnormal pressure pain thresholds, 46% (6/13 studies) reported sensory abnormalities in thermal pain thresholds and tolerance (cold and warm), and 50% (2/4 studies) reported abnormalities in temporal summation. CONCLUSION: Future studies should use standardized quantitative sensory testing protocols with consistent and operationalized definitions of sensitization to provide clear insight about pain processing and central sensitization in sickle cell disease.",

Significant variation existed in quantitative sensory testing methodologies across studies, including testing locations, type and intensity of stimuli, and interpretation of findings. Of the identified studies, 22% (2/9 studies) reported sensory abnormalities in mechanical sensitivity and thresholds, 22% (2/9 studies) reported abnormal pressure pain thresholds, 46% (6/13 studies) reported sensory abnormalities in thermal pain thresholds and tolerance (cold and warm), and 50% (2/4 studies) reported abnormalities in temporal summation. CONCLUSION: Future studies should use standardized quantitative sensory testing protocols with consistent and operationalized definitions of sensitization to provide clear insight about pain processing and central sensitization in sickle cell disease.",

PROCEDURE: A qualitative longitudinal multicenter study. Data collection consisted of 40 audio-recorded conversations between physicians and families and 77 interviews with patients and/or caregivers related to 27 unique cases, collected at different time points throughout the decision-making process. RESULTS: Conversations and interviews revealed \"hoping for a normal life\" as an overarching theme, consisting of four main topics: (i) \"Building a frame of reference\" refers to a process where patients or families try to obtain comprehensive information on HSCT and translate this to their situation to decide. (ii) \"Balancing between loss and benefit\" reports the process of considering the advantages and disadvantages of continuing with supportive care to treat their disease versus choosing HSCT. (iii) \"Experiencing the impact of HSCT\" describes the impactfull experience of the HSCT period by those who chose HSCT. (iv) \"Balancing again\" refers to reflecting on the decision made. CONCLUSIONS: The hope for a normal life guided the decision-making process, described as a constant balance between the impact of the disease and HSCT. A structured approach to explore patients' and caregivers' perspectives on HSCT decision-making is needed, where specifically discussing the impact of the disease and hope for a normal life need to be integrated in the process.",

METHODS: Transfusions performed in adults with sickle cell anemia treated at an emergency service in Sao Bernardo do Campo, Sao Paulo Brazil, between January 2018 and January 2022 were evaluated. For data comparison, the chi-square2 test was used. The significance level adopted was 5%. RESULTS: A total of 114 transfusions were performed. The mean age was 41.8+-16.4 years, and pretransfusion hemoglobin was 6.1+-1.23 g/dL. Regarding the indication, the adequacy of transfusions performed in symptomatic individuals was significantly higher compared to asymptomatic individuals (100% vs. 3.9%, p<0.001). Symptomatic individuals received excessive volumes of packed red blood cells less frequently than asymptomatic individuals (17.5% vs. 56.9%, p<0.001). The filtered subtype, indicated for sickle cell anemia, was prescribed in only a quarter of the patients. However, non-indicated subtypes were frequently prescribed. CONCLUSION: This study found low adequacy in the indication and calculation of the transfusion volume of packed red blood cells in asymptomatic individuals. Few patients received filtered red blood cells, resulting in increased risks of transfusion reactions. On the contrary, non-indicated subtypes were prescribed in a quarter of transfusions, which resulted in higher costs and delay in receiving packed red blood cells.",
