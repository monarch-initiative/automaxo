input_text: 'Difficult ventilation in a patient with a giant aortic aneurysm: A challenge
  for the anesthesiologist.Patients with Marfan syndrome present anatomic variations
  that may increase the risk of a difficult airway. Moreover, they can present large
  aortic aneurysms, which may cause extrinsic airway compression. Therefore, difficult
  ventilation during general anesthesia poses a challenge in that the anesthesiologist
  has to promptly make a crucial differential diagnosis. Multidisciplinary preoperative
  assessment and planning of the airway and ventilation management are of utmost importance
  in such uncommon and highly complex clinical cases. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy is probably
  a really useful tool in order to assess the severity and extent of the airway compression,
  both preoperatively and intraoperatively. We present a clinical case where difficult
  ventilation occurred immediately after the induction of general anesthesia.'
