input_text: 'Genotype-phenotype spectrum and prognosis of early-onset Marfan syndrome.BACKGROUND:
  Marfan syndrome is a genetic connective tissue disorder affecting skeletal, ocular,
  and cardiovascular organ systems. Previous research found that pathogenic variants
  clustered in exons 24-32 of fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene result in more severe clinical
  phenotypes. Furthermore, genotype-phenotype correlation studies suggested that more
  severe cardiovascular phenotypes were related to variants held responsible for haploinsufficiency.
  Our objective was to analyze the differences in clinical manifestations and genotypes
  of individuals with early-onset Marfan syndrome and to assess their impact on management
  strategies. METHODS: We analyzed clinical and genetic data of a new patient with
  early-onset Marfan syndrome together with 51 previously reported ones in the PubMed
  database between 1991 and 2022. RESULTS: Analysis showed 94% (49/52) of pathogenic
  variants clustered in exons 24-32 of the FBN1. The most common skeletal features
  were arachnodactyly (98%), reduced elbow extension (48%), pectus deformity (40%),
  and scoliosis (39%). Haploinsufficiency variants were reported as having poor outcome
  in 87.5% of the cases. Among patients carrying variants that substitute a cysteine
  for another amino acid and those that do not change cysteine content, cardiac intervention
  was found to be associated with a better outcome (p = 0.035 vs. p = 0.002). Variants
  that create an extra cysteine residue were found to be associated with a higher
  risk of ectopia lentis. Additionally, children up to 36-months-old were more often
  reported as still alive at the time of publication compared to newborns (p < 0.01).
  CONCLUSIONS: Our findings have implications for prognosis, because different genotype
  groups and their resulting phenotype may require personalized care and management.'
