input_text: 'Endovascular therapy for Stanford B aortic dissection for patients with
  Marfan Syndrome: systematic review and meta-analysis.INTRODUCTION: The role of thoracic
  endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) in patients with Marfan Syndrome with Stanford
  type B aortic dissection (TBAD) remains under debate. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: MEDLINE
  and EMBASE were searched through December 2021 to identify studies that investigated
  outcomes in MFS patients with TBAD who underwent TEVAR. Data regarding patient characteristics,
  perioperative and late outcomes were extracted. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Twelve studies
  were identified including 120 patients. The mean age was 40.2 years (95% confidence
  interval [CI], 36.8-43.6). 40.4% (95% CI: 10.8-70.0) of cases were performed emergently.
  76.2% (95% CI: 64.6-87.8) of patients had a history of previous aortic surgery.
  In-hospital mortality was 3.7% (95% CI: 0.6-6.8). Primary endoleak occurred in 15.2%
  (95% CI: 8.6-21.8), which was comprised of type 1 (9.3% [95% CI: 3.9-14.6]) and
  type 2 (7.1% [95% CI: 2.3-12.0]) endoleaks. During mean follow-up period of 37.4
  months (95% CI: 24.1-50.7), secondary endoleak was reported in 14.1% (95% CI: 7.1-21.1),
  which was comprised of type 1 (7.4% [95% CI: 2.4-12.5]) and type 2 (4.0% [95% CI:
  0.3-7.7]) endoleak. Repeat TEVAR was performed in 15.5% (95% CI: 9.3-21.8) and open
  aortic surgery in 18.6% (95% CI: 9.6-27.5). Long-term mortality was 11.9% (95% CI:
  6.5-17.3). CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis showed that TEVAR for TBAD in patients with
  MFS has low perioperative morbidity and mortality but was associated with a high
  rate of late reintervention. This treatment option should be limited to emergent
  cases and to patients deemed unsuitable for open repair. Lifelong follow-up with
  imaging is mandatory in this population.'
