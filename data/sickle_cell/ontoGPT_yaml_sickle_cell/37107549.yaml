input_text: 'The Role of Genetic Testing in Children Requiring Surgery for Ectopia
  Lentis.Non-traumatic ectopia lentis can be isolated or herald an underlying multisystemic
  disorder. Technological advances have revolutionized genetic testing for many ophthalmic
  disorders, and this study aims to provide insights into the clinical utility of
  genetic analysis in paediatric ectopia lentis. Children that underwent lens extraction
  for ectopia lentis between 2013 and 2017 were identified, and gene panel testing
  findings and surgical outcomes were collected. Overall, 10/11 cases received a probable
  molecular diagnosis. Genetic variants were identified in four genes: FBN1 (associated
  with Marfan syndrome and cardiovascular complications; n = 6), ADAMTSL4 (associated
  with non-syndromic ectopia lentis; n = 2), LTBP2 (n = 1) and ASPH (n = 1). Parents
  appeared unaffected in 6/11 cases; the initial presentation of all six of these
  children was to an ophthalmologist, and only 2/6 had FBN1 variants. Notably, 4/11
  cases required surgery before the age of 4 years, and only one of these children
  carried an FBN1 variant. In summary, in this retrospective cohort study, panel-based
  genetic testing pointed to a molecular diagnosis in >90% of paediatric ectopia lentis
  cases requiring surgery. In a subset of study participants, genetic analysis revealed
  changes in genes that have not been linked to extraocular manifestations and highlighted
  that extensive systemic investigations were not required in these individuals. We
  propose the introduction of genetic testing early in the diagnostic pathway in children
  with ectopia lentis.'
