input_text: 'Outcomes of valve-sparing surgery in heritable aortic disorders: results
  from the AVIATOR registry.OBJECTIVES: Root reimplantation has been the favoured
  approach for patients with heritable aortic disorder requiring valve-sparring root
  replacement. In the past few years, root remodelling with annuloplasty has emerged
  as an alternative to root reimplantation in the general population. The aim of this
  study was to examine the late outcomes of patients with heritable aortic disorder
  undergoing valve-sparring root replacement and compare different techniques. METHODS:
  Using the AVIATOR registry (Aortic Valve Insufficiency and ascending aorta Aneurysm
  InternATiOnal Registry), data were collected from 5 North American and European
  centres. Patients were divided into 4 groups according to the technique of valve-sparing
  used (root reimplantation, root remodelling with ring annuloplasty, root remodelling
  with suture annuloplasty and root remodelling alone). The primary endpoints were
  freedom from aortic regurgitation (AR) >=2 and freedom from reintervention on the
  aortic valve. Secondary endpoints were survival and changes in annular dimensions
  over time. RESULTS: A total of 237 patients were included in the study (reimplantation
  = 100, remodelling + ring annuloplasty = 76, remodelling + suture annuloplasty =
  34, remodelling alone = 27). The majority of patients had Marfan syndrome (83%).
  Preoperative AR >=2 was present in 41% of the patients. Operative mortality was
  0.4% (n = 1). No differences were found between techniques in terms of postoperative
  AR >=2 (P = 0.58), reintervention (P = 0.52) and survival (P = 0.59). Changes in
  aortic annulus dimension were significantly different at 10 years (P < 0.05), a
  difference that started to emerge 4 years after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, valve-sparring
  root replacement is a safe and durable procedure in patients with heritable aortic
  disorder. Nevertheless, root remodelling alone is associated with late annular dilatation.
  The addition of an annuloplasty, however, results in similar freedom from AR, reintervention,
  survival and changes in annulus size compared to reimplantation.'
