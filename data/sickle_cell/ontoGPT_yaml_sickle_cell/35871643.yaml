input_text: 'Surgical outcomes associated with sleep apnea syndrome in Stanford A
  aortic dissection patients.BACKGROUND: Patients suffering from aortic dissection
  (AD) often experience sleep apnea syndrome (SAS), which aggravates their respiratory
  function and aortic false lumen expansion. METHODS: We analyzed the peri-operative
  data of Stanford A AD patients, with or without SAS, between January 2017 and June
  2019. Subjects were separated into SAS positive (SAS+) and SAS negative (SAS-) cohorts,
  based on the Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) and the Oxygen Desaturation Index (ODI).
  We next analyzed variables between the SAS+ and SAS- groups. RESULTS: 155, out of
  198 AAD patients, were enlisted for this study. SAS+ patients exhibited higher rates
  of pneumonia (p < 0.001), heart failure (HF, p = 0.038), acute kidney injury (AKI,
  p = 0.001), ventilation time (p = 0.009), and hospitalization duration (p < 0.001).
  According to subsequent follow-ups, the unstented aorta false lumen dilatation (FLD)
  rate increased markedly, with increasing degree of SAS (p < 0.001, according to
  AHI and ODI). The SAS+ patients exhibited worse cumulative survival rate (p = 0.025).
  The significant risk factors (RF) for poor survival were: severe (p = 0.002) or
  moderate SAS (p = 0.008), prolonged ventilation time (p = 0.018), AKI (p = 0.015),
  HF New York Heart Association (NYHA) IV (p = 0.005) or III (p = 0.015), pneumonia
  (p = 0.005), Marfan syndrome (p = 0.010), systolic blood pressure (BP) upon arrival
  (p = 0.009), and BMI >= 30 (p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: SAS+ Stanford A AD patients
  primarily exhibited higher rates of complications and low survival rates in the
  mid-time follow-up. Hence, the RFs associated with poor survival must be monitored
  carefully in SAS patients. Moreover, the FLD rate is related to the degree of SAS,
  thus treating SAS may mitigate FLD.'
