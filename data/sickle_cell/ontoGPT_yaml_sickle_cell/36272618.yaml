input_text: 'Current controversies in aortic valve-preserving surgery.The clinical
  outcome of severe aortic regurgitation (AR) remains suboptimal, but surgery has
  been shown to have survival benefit over medical therapy. Postoperative survival
  is inferior in patients with reduced left ventricular function, and therefore early
  surgical intervention is recommended. Aortic valvuloplasty (AVP) is an attractive
  option to avoid the major drawbacks of prosthetic valves but has not been widely
  adopted. The etiology of AR is classified functionally into three groups: normal
  leaflet motion (type I), cusp prolapse (type II), and restriction (type III). Type
  I with dilatation of the sinus of Valsalva (type Ib) can be repaired by aortic valve
  reimplantation or aortic root remodeling with similar valve stability. Type I with
  dilatation of the aortic annulus (type Ic) can be managed by annuloplasty. Type
  II can be corrected by plication or resuspension techniques. Pericardial patch is
  necessary in AVP for type Id (perforation/fenestration) and type III but is associated
  with risk of recurrence. Bicuspid aortic valve is classified according to commissure
  angle: symmetrical, asymmetrical, and very asymmetrical. Tricuspidization is recommended
  for repair of very asymmetrical valves to avoid postoperative stenosis. Recent progress
  has achieved similar reoperation rates between bicuspid and tricuspid aortic valve
  repair. For Marfan syndrome, valve-sparing root replacement is advantageous compared
  to Bentall operation regarding late survival, thromboembolic and hemorrhagic events,
  and endocarditis. Similar findings have been reported in acute aortic dissection.
  Both remodeling and reimplantation procedures provide similar favorable outcomes
  in these settings. Recent advances in AVP are summarized by quantitative assessment
  of cusp configuration (effective height and geometric height), graft size decision,
  use of template to cut the graft, and videoscopic assessment of post-repair cusp
  configuration. Due to these advances, AVP shows superior results to replacement
  surgery. Further concrete evidence with larger case volumes and longer observation
  periods are necessary to popularize AVP.'
