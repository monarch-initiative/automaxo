input_text: "Ravitch surgery or dynamic compression bracing for pectus carinatum:
  a retrospective cohort study.BACKGROUND: Pectus carinatum is a pediatric condition
  which can be treated by dynamic compression system (DCS) bracing or surgery. Several
  publications concerning DCS-bracing or surgery are published, however without comparing
  both treatments. METHODS: Over a 10 year period 738 patients with pectus carinatum
  were treated. We describe our 10-years' experience and results of both treatments.
  RESULTS: Of the 631 patients who received DCS-bracing treatment, 553 finished treatment
  and 78 patients are still under treatment. Seventy-three point eight percent (n=408)
  of patients finished treatment successfully, 13.6% (n=75) failed treatment and 12.7%
  (n=70) were lost to follow-up. Success rate decreased with an increasing pressure
  of initial compression (84.2%-67.3%). Marfan and Poland syndrome were related to
  bad results.Ravitch surgery was performed in 105 patients with a success rate of
  92.4%. Complications occurred in 32.4% of patients and 6.7% of patients had complications
  for which surgery was needed. No relationship was found between osteotomy or sternal
  fixation and outcomes or complications. Abramson procedure was performed in two
  patients. CONCLUSIONS: DCS-bracing should be the treatment of choice in patients
  with pectus carinatum because its non-invasiveness, good results and a lower complication
  rate compared to surgery. Besides pressure of initial correction, motivation is
  an important factor influencing outcomes and compliance remains a major challenge
  in treating pectus carinatum using DCS-bracing. Bracing patients before their growth
  spurt should be discouraged. Patients with a higher pressure of initial compression
  (>8.0-8.5) and Marfan and Poland syndrome have poorer outcomes. In those cases surgery
  may be considered."
