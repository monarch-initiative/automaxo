input_text: 'Morphometric assessment of the ciliary body in patients with Marfan syndrome
  and ectopia lentis: A quantitative study using ultrasound biomicroscopy: Ciliary
  body morphology in Marfan syndrome and ectopia lentis.PURPOSE: To explore the biometric
  characteristics of the ciliary body in patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS) and ectopia
  lentis (EL). DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: Seventy-two consecutive MFS
  patients with EL and 72 non-disease controls were recruited. Ciliary body biometric
  parameters such as ciliary muscle cross-sectional area at 2000 mum from the scleral
  spur (CMA2000), ciliary muscle thickness at 1000 mum from the scleral spur (CMT1000),
  and maximum ciliary body thickness (CBTmax) were measured from multiple directions
  with ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM). The relationship between ciliary body parameters
  and other ocular characteristics was also evaluated. RESULTS: Average CMA2000, CMT1000,
  and CBTmax were 0.692 +- 0.015 mm2, 0.405 +- 0.010 mm, and 0.855+-0.023 mm in MFS
  eyes, respectively, and were significantly smaller than controls (all p < 0.001).
  The prevalence of ciliary body thinning was 22.2% in the MFS group versus 0 in controls
  (p < 0.001); eyes with more severe EL had smaller CMA2000 (p = 0.050), thinner CMT1000
  (p = 0.022) and shorter CBTmax (p = 0.015). Patients with microspherophakia (MSP)
  had even smaller CMA2000 (p = 0.033) and CMT1000 (p = 0.044) than those without
  MSP. The most common subluxation direction was in the superonasal quadrant (25,
  39.7%), which probably correlates with the thinnest CMT1000 in the inferotemporal
  quadrant (p = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: MFS patients with EL had thinner ciliary muscles,
  shorter ciliary processes, and a higher prevalence of ciliary body thinning, especially
  those with MSP. Both the extent and direction of subluxation were associated with
  ciliary body biometry.'
