input_text: Genetic of thoracic aorta aneurysmThe thoracic aortic aneurysm corresponds
  to the dilation of the ascending part of the aorta, which can lead to a dissection
  (TAAD for Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm and Dissection) or aortic rupture. The etiologies
  are diverse, but in approximately 20% of cases a genetic origin is found. About
  thirty genes are reported to be responsible for the development of TAAD. The majority
  of these genes encode for proteins involved in the extracellular matrix, the contraction
  of smooth muscle cells or the growth factor TGF-beta signaling pathway. Identifying
  the pathogenic variant responsible for the aortic disease becomes essential to make
  a definitive diagnosis, to guide and to personalize the treatment of the patients
  but also to screen relatives at risk. The availability and access to genetic testing
  have improved considerably with the development of new sequencing techniques (NGS
  for Next Generation Sequencing) and the use of gene panels. This review summarizes
  the main genes associated with TAAD as well as the current diagnostic strategy.
