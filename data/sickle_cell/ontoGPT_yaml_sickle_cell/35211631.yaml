input_text: 'Impact of Notch3 Activation on Aortic Aneurysm Development in Marfan
  Syndrome.BACKGROUND: The leading cause of mortality in patients with Marfan syndrome
  (MFS) is thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection. Notch signaling is essential for
  vessel morphogenesis and function. However, the role of Notch signaling in aortic
  pathology and aortic smooth muscle cell (SMC) differentiation in Marfan syndrome
  (MFS) is not completely understood. METHODS: RNA-sequencing on ascending aortic
  tissue from a mouse model of MFS, Fbn1mgR/mgR , and wild-type controls was performed.
  Notch 3 expression and activation in aortic tissue were confirmed with real-time
  RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, and Western blot. Fbn1mgR/mgR and wild-type mice were
  treated with a gamma-secretase inhibitor, DAPT, to block Notch activation. Aortic
  aneurysms and rupture were evaluated with connective tissue staining, ultrasound,
  and life table analysis. RESULTS: The murine RNA-sequencing data were validated
  with mouse and human MFS aortic tissue, demonstrating elevated Notch3 activation
  in MFS. Data further revealed that upregulation and activation of Notch3 were concomitant
  with increased expression of SMC contractile markers. Inhibiting Notch3 activation
  with DAPT attenuated aortic enlargement and improved survival of Fbn1mgR/mgR mice.
  DAPT treatment reduced elastin fiber fragmentation in the aorta and reversed the
  differentiation of SMCs. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrated that matrix abnormalities
  in the aorta of MFS are associated with increased Notch3 activation. Enhanced Notch3
  activation in MFS contributed to aortic aneurysm formation in MFS. This might be
  mediated by inducing a contractile phenotypic change of SMC. Our results suggest
  that inhibiting Notch3 activation may provide a strategy to prevent and treat aortic
  aneurysms in MFS.'
