input_text: 'Combined Bentall and Modified Ravitch Procedures: A Case Report and Systematic
  Review of the Evidence.Background and Objectives: Marfan syndrome (MS) is a genetic
  disorder with autosomal dominant inheritance that affects the connective tissue
  and consequently many organ systems. The cardiovascular manifestations of MS are
  notorious and include aortic root dilatation or acute aortic dissection, which can
  cause morbidity and early mortality. However, surgical treatment of aortic pathology
  may be complicated by musculoskeletal deformity of the chest wall, as in pectus
  excavatum. In this regard, single-stage combined Bentall and Ravitch surgery is
  an extreme rarity that has also been scarcely reported in the literature. Patients
  and Methods: We present the medical history and single-stage Bentall and modified
  Ravitch surgical treatment of an 18-year-old male MS patient with symptomatic and
  severe pectus excavatum (PEX) in conjunction with a pear-shaped aortic root aneurysm.
  To discuss our case in the context of a synopsis of similar published cases, we
  present a systematic review of combined Bentall surgical aortic aneurysm repair
  and Ravitch correction of PEX. Results: A total of four studies (one case series
  and three case reports) and a case from our institution describing a single-stage
  combined Bentall and Ravitch operation were included. Patients were 22 +- 5.9 years
  of age (median = 22.5 years) and predominantly male (60%). All cases reported a
  midline vertical skin incision over the sternum. The most common surgical approach
  was midsternotomy (80%). In all cases metal struts were used to reinforce the corrected
  chest wall. Postoperative mortality was zero. Conclusions: Single-stage combined
  Bentall and Ravitch surgery is an underutilized surgical approach. Its use in MS
  patients with concomitant PEX and ascending aortic aneurysm that require surgical
  treatment warrants further investigation. Midsternotomy seems to be a viable access
  route that provides sufficient exposure in the single-stage surgical setting. Although
  operative time is long, the intraoperative and postoperative risks appear to be
  low and manageable.'
