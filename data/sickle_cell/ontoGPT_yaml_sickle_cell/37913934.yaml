input_text: "Clinical application of four-dimensional flow cardiovascular magnetic
  resonance in Marfan syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis.This study aims
  to fill this gap by assessing the application of 4D flow CMR in MFS through a systematic
  review and meta-analysis. We conducted a comprehensive search of databases from
  their inception to May 1, 2023. Eligibility criteria were established based on the
  Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.
  The quality of studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS), with
  studies scoring above five deemed high quality. Meta-analyses were performed using
  Stata 15.1 software. Nine studies were analyzed. Findings indicate MFS patients
  had increased vortex flow in the descending aorta (DAo), larger aortic root diameter
  (ARD) and Z-scores, lower inner wall shear stress (WSS) in the proximal descending
  aorta (pDAo), reduced in-plane rotational flow (IRF) in the aortic arch and proximal
  descending aorta (pDAo), and increased pulse wave velocity (PWV) in the ascending
  aorta (AAo) and DAo compared to healthy subjects. No significant difference in systolic
  flow reversal ratio was observed. Sensitivity analysis showed no heterogeneity and
  Egger's test revealed no publication bias. This meta-analysis underscores the effectiveness
  of 4D flow CMR in detecting MFS, particularly through indicators such as vortex
  flow, WSS, IRF, ARD, and PWV. The findings provide insights into diagnosing cardiovascular
  diseases and predicting cardiovascular events in MFS patients. Further case-control
  studies are needed to establish measurement standards and explore potential indicators
  for improved diagnosis and treatment of MFS."
