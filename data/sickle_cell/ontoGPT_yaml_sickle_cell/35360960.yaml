input_text: 'Modified Bentall procedure: A 15-year single-center clinical experience.OBJECTIVE:
  Bentall procedure is a standard technique for complete aortic root replacement but
  a huge challenge is postoperative bleeding. Many modifications have been proposed
  and the "button technique" is commonly used. With a 15-year experience, this study
  was to evaluate outcomes of this modified Bentall procedure. METHODS: A retrospective
  study was performed with all patients who underwent the Bentall procedure with a
  button technique between 2005 and 2020. Commercially available composite grafts
  were used in 38 patients and self-assembled composite graft was used in 74 patients.
  Safety outcome was postoperative complications and long-term outcomes included overall
  and reoperation-free survivals. RESULTS: Among 112 patients, the mean age was 46.3
  years and 69.6% were men. Indications for the Bentall procedure were ascending aortic
  aneurysm and valve regurgitation (59.8%), aortic dissection (19.6%), Marfan syndrome
  (17%), and endocarditis (3.6%). Three patients (2.7%) died in hospital. During a
  median follow-up period of 42 months, 11 patients died and 7 patients required reoperation.
  Overall survival and reoperation-free survival were 86.1% and 83.4% at 5 years and
  86.1% and 72.6% at 10 years, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The Bentall procedure with
  a button technique is safe and effective for aortic root replacement. Further investigations
  are required to improve the feasibility and effectiveness of the procedure.'
