input_text: 'Acute dissection into a large abdominal aortic aneurysm in a patient
  with Marfan syndrome.OBJECTIVES: Synchronous aortic dissection (AD) with involvement
  of pre-existing infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are fortunately rare.
  Extension of the dissection flap to involve the aneurysm is particularly dangerous
  with pressurization of the false lumen within a diseased aortic wall. The aim of
  this article is to present a unique case of an acute AD with extension to involve
  a large AAA in a patient with an underlying connective tissue disorder. METHODS:
  A 24-year-old male Marfan syndrome patient with prior type A dissection repair presented
  with a descending thoracic AD and a separate 7.0-cm infrarenal AAA. He was initially
  medically managed but developed acute extension of the dissection flap to involve
  the large aneurysm. RESULTS: The patient was initially treated with open infrarenal
  aortic replacement under left atrialfemoral artery bypass. Three years later, he
  developed degeneration of the residual aorta and underwent a two-stage hybrid repair.
  He underwent an additional stent graft for a distal anastomotic leak. At 5 years
  of follow-up, there was positive aneurysm remodeling and sac regression. CONCLUSION:
  This case illustrates the challenges in treating a patient with synchronous aortic
  processes. False lumen pressurization of a large aneurysm wall is fortunately rare
  but can be lethal. Prompt intervention is required but the presence of an underlying
  connective tissue disorder may limit endovascular treatment options. Careful case
  planning is mandatory and multiple interventions should be anticipated.'
