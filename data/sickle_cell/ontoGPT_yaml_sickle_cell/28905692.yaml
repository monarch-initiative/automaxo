input_text: 'The emerging challenge of optimal blood pressure management and hypertensive
  syndromes in pregnant women with sickle cell disease: a review.INTRODUCTION: Sickle
  cell disease (SCD) is one of the most common hemoglobinopathy, affecting a considerable
  proportion of black populations of African origin, Middle East and in the Indian
  sub-continent. Women with SCD are more likely to experience adverse pregnancy and
  delivery outcomes. Hypertensive diseases in pregnancy such as preeclampsia and eclampsia
  are more common in women with sickle cell disease. Areas covered: This review examined
  the influence of hypertension and SCD in pregnancy, and provides the preliminary
  evidence that the traditional systolic and diastolic blood pressure thresholds for
  hypertensive disorders such as pre-eclampsia and eclampsia may require reassessment
  in pregnant women with SCD. The causes of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality,
  hypertensive complications of pregnancy in women with and without sickle cell disease
  were reviewed. A MEDLINE database search using medical subject headings (MeSH) and
  keywords for articles regarding sickle cell disease, pregnancy and hypertension
  was performed. Expert commentary: Pregnancy in women with sickle cell disease is
  associated with high maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Using the existing
  thresholds for diagnosis and treatment for hypertensive disease in pregnancy without
  adjustment to accommodate for the lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure in
  those with sickle cell disease may worsen an already poor maternal and perinatal
  outcome in this population.'
