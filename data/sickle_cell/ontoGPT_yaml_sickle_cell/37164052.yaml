input_text: 'Risk profile and operative outcomes in patients with and without Marfan
  syndrome undergoing thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair.OBJECTIVES: To compare
  operative and long-term outcomes between patients with and without Marfan syndrome
  undergoing thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair. METHODS: We identified all consecutive
  patients undergoing thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair between 1997 and 2022.
  Primary outcome was composite of major adverse events. Secondary outcomes were individual
  complications and long-term survival. Inverse probability of treatment weighting
  was performed. Weighted Kaplan-Meier curves were used to estimate long-term survival.
  Multivariable analysis identified factors associated with major adverse events.
  RESULTS: Six hundred eighty-four patients underwent open thoracoabdominal aortic
  aneurysm repair. Ninety (13.1%) had Marfan syndrome, whereas 594 (86.9%) did not.
  Marfan patients were younger (46 years [range, 36-56 years] vs 69 years [range,
  61-76 years]; P < .001). Extent II or III aneurysms (57 out of 90 [63.3%] vs 211
  out of 594 [35.6%]; P < .001) and type I or III chronic dissection (77 out of 90
  [85.3%] vs 242 out of 594 [40.8%]; P < .001) were more common. Cardiovascular risk
  factors were less frequent in Marfan patients. There was no difference in major
  adverse events between groups (12 out of 90 [13.3%] vs 100 out of 594 [16.8%]; P
  = .49). Operative mortality was similar between groups (3 out of 90 [3.3%] vs 28
  out of 594 [4.7%]; P = .75). Unweighted survival at 10 years was 78.7% vs 46.8%
  (P = .001). Weighted Kaplan-Meier curves showed no difference in long-term survival
  (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.32-1.99; P = .62; Log-rank P = .12). At
  multivariable analysis, renal insufficiency (odds ratio, 2.29; 95% CI, 1.43-3.68;
  P < .01) and urgent/emergency procedure (odds ratio, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.35-3.48; P
  < .01) were associated with major adverse events, whereas Marfan syndrome was not
  (odds ratio, 1.56; 95% CI, 0.69-3.49; P = .28). CONCLUSIONS: Open thoracoabdominal
  aortic aneurysm repair can be performed with similar operative outcomes in patients
  with and without Marfan syndrome despite differing risk profiles. Operative/perioperative
  strategies must be tailored to specific needs of each patient to optimize outcomes.'
