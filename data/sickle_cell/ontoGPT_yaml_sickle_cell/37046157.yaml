input_text: 'Extended law of laplace for measurement of the cloverleaf anatomy of
  the aortic root.The cross-sectional shape of the aortic root is cloverleaf, not
  circular, raising controversy regarding how best to measure its radiographic "diameter"
  for aortic event prediction. We mathematically extended the law of Laplace to estimate
  aortic wall stress within this cloverleaf region, simultaneously identifying a new
  metric of aortic root dimension that can be applied to clinical measurement of the
  aortic root and sinuses of Valsalva on clinical computerized tomographic scans.
  Enforcing equilibrium between blood pressure and wall stress, finite element computations
  were performed to evaluate the mathematical derivation. The resulting Laplace diameter
  was compared with existing methods of aortic root measurement across four patient
  groups: non-syndromic aneurysm, bicuspid aortic valve, Marfan syndrome, and non-dilated
  root patients (total 106 patients, 62 M, 44 F). (1) Wall stress: Mean wall stress
  at the depth of the sinuses followed this equation: Wall stress = BP x Circumscribing
  circle diameter/(2 x Aortic wall thickness). Therefore, the diameter of the circle
  enclosing the root cloverleaf, that is, twice the distance between the center, where
  the sinus-to-commissure lines coincide, and the depth of the sinuses, may replace
  diameter in the Laplace relation for a cloverleaf cross-section (or any shaped cross-section
  with two or more planes of symmetry). This mathematically derived result was verified
  by computational finite element analyses. (2) Diameters: CT scan measurements showed
  a significant difference between this new metric, the Laplace diameter, and the
  sinus-to-commissure, mid-sinus-to-mid-sinus, and coronal measurements in all four
  groups (p-value < 0.05). The average Laplace diameter measurements differed significantly
  from the other measurements in all patient groups. Among the various possible measurements
  within the aortic root, the diameter of the circumscribing circle, enclosing the
  cloverleaf, represents the diameter most closely related to wall stress. This diameter
  is larger than the other measurements, indicating an underestimation of wall stress
  by prior measurements, and otherwise provides an unbiased, convenient, consistent,
  physics-based measurement for clinical use. "Diameter" applies to circles. Our mathematical
  derivation of an extension of the law of Laplace, from circular to cloverleaf cross-sectional
  geometries of the aortic root, has implications for measurement of aortic root "diameter."
  The suggested method is as follows: (1) the "center" of the aortic root is identified
  by drawing three sinus-to-commissure lines. The intersection of these three lines
  identifies the "center" of the cloverleaf. (2) The largest radius from this center
  point to any of the sinuses is identified as the "radius" of the aortic root. (3)
  This radius is doubled to give the "diameter" of the aortic root. We find that this
  diameter best corresponds to maximal wall stress in the aortic root. Please note
  that this diameter defines the smallest circle that completely encloses the cloverleaf
  shape, touching the depths of all three sinuses.'
