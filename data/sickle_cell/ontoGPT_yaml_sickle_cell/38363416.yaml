input_text: "Longitudinal changes of refractive error in preschool children with congenital
  ectopia lentis.BACKGROUND: Congenital ectopia lentis (CEL) is a hereditary eye disease
  which severely impacts preschool children's visual function and development. This
  study aimed to evaluate the longitudinal changes in spherical equivalent (SE) refractive
  error in preschool children with CEL. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was
  conducted at Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Guangzhou, China. Medical records of CEL
  patients under 6-year-old who were diagnosed with Marfan syndrome at the initial
  visit from January 2014 to March 2022 were collected and were divided into surgery
  and non-surgery groups. Mean change rate of SE in the two groups was evaluated,
  and the potential associated factors of SE change rate were investigated by mixed-effect
  regression model. RESULTS: A total of 94 preschool patients from 14 provinces of
  China were included. Among the 42 children of the surgery group, the mean age with
  standard deviation (SD) was 5.02 +- 0.81 years and patients experienced a myopic
  shift of -0.05 +- 0.09 D/month in average. The mean age with SD of the 52 children
  of the non-surgery group was 4.34 +- 1.02 years, and the mean myopic shift was -0.09
  +- 0.14 D/month. The mixed-effect regression model identified that higher degree
  of myopia at baseline was associated with slower myopic shift both in surgery (beta
  = 0.901, 95% CI: 0.822 ~ 0.980, P < 0.001) and in non-surgery group (beta = 1.006,
  95% CI: 0.977 ~ 1.034, P < 0.001) in CEL patients. Surgical treatment (beta = 2.635,
  95% CI: 1.376 ~ 3.894, P < 0.001) was associated with slower myopic shift in all
  participants CEL patients. CONCLUSIONS: Myopic progression was slower in the surgery
  group than in the non-surgery group of CEL. Preschool CEL patients who met the surgical
  indication are suggested being performed with timely surgery to slow down the myopic
  progression."
