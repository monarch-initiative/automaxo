input_text: 'Patient perspectives on noninvasive prenatal testing among black women
  in the United States: a scoping review.Advances in reproductive health technologies
  such as noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) are changing the landscape of prenatal
  care and maternal health. NIPT, made clinically available in the United States (US)
  in 2011, is a screening test that utilizes cell-free DNA (cfDNA) to detect for aneuploidies
  and genetic characteristics in fetal DNA. In September 2020, the American College
  of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommended NIPT for all pregnant patients
  regardless of age or risk factors. We examined peer-reviewed, empirical studies
  published from January 2011 to February 2022, assessing NIPT studies with patient
  perspectives in the US and what is known about how empirical studies include Black
  women. Our scoping review draws from PubMed (with advanced MeSH search options)
  and Scopus databases for advanced scoping review, with 33 articles meeting our criteria.
  Empirical studies on NIPT show patient perceptions range across five themes: 1)
  accuracy / safety, 2) return of results, 3) patient knowledge, 4) informed consent,
  and 5) perceptions among minoritized groups (with perceptions of race and gender
  as a social demographic intersection). Additionally, among the 15 studies that included
  that Black woman in their study sample, none measured the perceptions of Black women
  with genetic conditions. Bridging this knowledge gap is critical because NIPT is
  becoming increasingly accessible across the nation and is being developed to screen
  for additional genetic conditions, such as sickle cell disease. Ultimately, NIPT
  researchers need to go to greater lengths to examine the patient perspectives of
  Black women with and without genetic conditions.'
