input_text: 'Outcomes After Extent I Thoracoabdominal Aortic Repair: Focus on Heritable
  Aortic Disease.BACKGROUND: Crawford extent I thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA)
  repairs are increasingly performed by an endovascular approach, including in patients
  with heritable thoracic aortic disease (HTAD). We evaluated outcomes after open
  extent I TAAA repair in patients with and without HTAD. METHODS: This retrospective
  study included 992 patients (median age 67 y [57-73]) who underwent extent I TAAA
  (1990-2022), stratified by the presence of HTAD (n=177, 17.8%). Patients with HTAD
  had either genetic aortopathies or presented at age <=50 years; 35% (62/177) had
  Marfan syndrome. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of operative
  mortality and adverse event (ie, operative death or persistent [present at discharge]
  stroke, paraplegia, paraparesis, or renal failure necessitating dialysis). Long-term
  outcomes were analyzed with competing risks analysis. RESULTS: Patients with HTAD
  had lower operative mortality (1.7% vs 7.0%, P=.01) and adverse event rates (2.8%
  vs 12.3%, P<.001) than non-HTAD patients. Most HTAD patients were discharged home
  (92.6% vs 76.9%, P<.001). Predictors of operative mortality were increasing age,
  aortic dissection, tobacco use, chronic symptoms, and rupture; predictors for adverse
  events were increasing age, acute symptoms, chronic dissection, and rupture. Patients
  with HTAD had substantially better repair-failure-free survival (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS:
  Open extent I TAAA repair was effective in patients with HTAD, with low operative
  mortality and adverse event rates, better late survival, and excellent long-term
  durability, making a compelling argument for preferring open repair in these patients.'
