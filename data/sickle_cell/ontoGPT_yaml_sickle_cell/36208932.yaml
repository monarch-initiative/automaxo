input_text: 'Unique robotic vascular surgery procedures.INTRODUCTION: Based on their
  experience with robot-assisted vascular surgery, the authors present some unique
  types of procedures they have performed in this area. METHODS: From November 2005
  to February 2022, a total of 560 robotic vascular procedures were performed, of
  which 70 were orphan operations, corresponding to 12.5%. The most common was robotic
  decompression of the coeliac trunk (18 times) in Dunbar syndrome, followed by robotic
  repair of type II endoleak after stent graft implantation (15 times) and robotic
  repair of splenic artery aneurysm (11 times). Less common were isolated pelvic artery
  aneurysm surgery (8 times), aortic thromboenderectomy and abdominal aortic patch
  repair (8 times) and hybrid surgery (6 times). Completely unique are renal artery
  reconstruction (2 times), operation of internal mammary artery aneurysm (1 time)
  in a patient with Marfan syndrome and paracaval biopsy (1 time) in a cancer patient.
  RESULTS: In 3 cases (4.2%) the operation had to be converted to open surgery. Twice
  in the management of splenic artery aneurysm due to flat adhesions in the abdominal
  cavity and once in the endoleak operation, when due to the very fragile wall of
  the dilated and pulsating abdominal aortic aneurysm sac, we considered manipulation
  with robotic instruments to be highly risky. There was zero mortality in this cohort;
  one patient had to undergo laparoscopic diaphragm repair for diaphragmatic hernia
  at another institution after deliberation of the coeliac trunk and in one case open
  surgery was needed for persistent endoleak. CONCLUSION: The use of the robotic system
  can be beneficial also in less frequent procedures, offering the patients all the
  advantages of robotic surgery. However, the need of extensive experience in robotic
  surgery should be emphasized because these operations are rare and perfect anatomical
  knowledge of the area is necessary.'
