input_text: Discrepancy of echocardiography and computed tomography in initial assessment
  and 2-year follow-up for monitoring Marfan syndrome and related disorders.Patients
  with Marfan syndrome and related disorders are at risk for aortic dissection and
  aortic rupture and therefore require appropriate monitoring. Computed tomography
  (CT) and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) are routinely used for initial diagnosis
  and follow-up. The purpose of this study is to compare whole-heart CT and TTE aortic
  measurement for initial work-up, 2-year follow-up, and detection of progressive
  aortic enlargement. This retrospective study included 95 patients diagnosed with
  Marfan syndrome or a related disorder. All patients underwent initial work-up including
  aortic diameter measurement using both electrocardiography-triggered whole-heart
  CT and TTE. Forty-two of these patients did not undergo aortic repair after initial
  work-up and were monitored by follow-up imaging within 2 years. Differences between
  the two methods for measuring aortic diameters were compared using Bland-Altman
  plots. The acceptable clinical limit of agreement (acLOA) for initial work-up, follow-up,
  and progression within 2 years was predefined as <  +- 2 mm. Bland-Altman analysis
  revealed a small bias of 0.2 mm with wide limits of agreement (LOA) from + 6.3 to
  - 5.9 mm for the aortic sinus and a relevant bias of - 1.6 mm with wide LOA from
  + 5.6 to - 8.9 mm for the ascending aorta. Follow-up imaging yielded a small bias
  of 0.5 mm with a wide LOA from + 6.7 to - 5.8 mm for the aortic sinus and a relevant
  bias of 1.1 mm with wide LOA from + 8.1 to - 10.2 mm for the ascending aorta. Progressive
  aortic enlargement at follow-up was detected in 57% of patients using CT and 40%
  of patients using TTE. Measurement differences outside the acLOA were most frequently
  observed for the ascending aorta. Whole-heart CT and TTE measurements show good
  correlation, but the frequency of measurement differences outside the acLOA is high.
  TTE systematically overestimates aortic diameters. Therefore, whole-heart CT may
  be preferred for aortic monitoring of patients with Marfan syndrome and related
  disorders. TTE remains an indispensable imaging tool that provides additional information
  not available with CT.
