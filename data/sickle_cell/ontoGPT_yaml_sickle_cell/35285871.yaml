input_text: 'Open surgical replacement of the descending thoracic and thoracoabdominal
  aorta in patients with confirmed Marfan and Loeys-Dietz syndromes: A 20-year single-centre
  experience.OBJECTIVES: A relatively small proportion of patients with heritable
  thoracic aortic disease require open surgical replacement of the distal thoracic
  aorta. We reviewed the outcome in patients with Marfan and Loeys-Dietz syndromes
  treated in an aortic centre in the United Kingdom. METHODS: We performed a single-centre
  retrospective study of consecutive patients treated between October 1999 and December
  2019. The primary end point was 30-day mortality. Secondary end points were Kaplan-Meier
  estimates of medium-term survival and freedom from distal reintervention. Data are
  presented as median (interquartile range). RESULTS: A total of 58 patients [33 men;
  51 with Marfan syndrome; median age 41 years (35-48); median aneurysm diameter 60
  mm (55-74)] underwent open descending (n = 21) or thoracoabdominal aortic replacement
  (n = 37). All repairs were performed using cardiopulmonary bypass with hypothermic
  circulatory arrest in 31 patients. The 30-day mortality was 5.2% (n = 3, including
  2 patients >= 60 years with significant comorbidity). Major non-fatal complications
  included early reoperation (n = 7), tracheostomy (n = 9), temporary renal replacement
  therapy (n = 3), permanent spinal cord deficit (n = 2) and permanent stroke (n =
  1). Median follow-up was 81 months (48-127). Estimated (+-standard error) 5-year
  survival was 85% +-5%. Seven patients had distal aortic reintervention with no deaths
  or spinal cord deficit: estimated 5-year freedom from distal reintervention was
  94% +-3%. There was no difference in survival or freedom from distal reintervention
  comparing: elective vs. non-elective; type of heritable thoracic aortic disease;
  DeBakey type; or extent of surgical repair. CONCLUSIONS: Descending thoracic and
  thoracoabdominal aortic replacement in patients with heritable thoracic aortic disease
  can be performed with low perioperative morbidity and mortality, satisfactory long-term
  survival and low requirement for distal reintervention.'
