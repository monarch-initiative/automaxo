input_text: 'Outcomes After Endovascular Aortic Intervention in Patients With Connective
  Tissue Disease.Importance: Endovascular treatment is not recommended for aortic
  pathologies in patients with connective tissue diseases (CTDs) other than in redo
  operations and as bridging procedures in emergencies. However, recent developments
  in endovascular technology may challenge this dogma. Objective: To assess the midterm
  outcomes of endovascular aortic repair in patients with CTD. Design, Setting, and
  Participants: For this descriptive retrospective study, data on demographics, interventions,
  and short-term and midterm outcomes were collected from 18 aortic centers in Europe,
  Asia, North America, and New Zealand. Patients with CTD who had undergone endovascular
  aortic repair from 2005 to 2020 were included. Data were analyzed from December
  2021 to November 2022. Exposure: All principal endovascular aortic repairs, including
  redo surgery and complex repairs of the aortic arch and visceral aorta. Main Outcomes
  and Measures: Short-term and midterm survival, rates of secondary procedures, and
  conversion to open repair. Results: In total, 171 patients were included: 142 with
  Marfan syndrome, 17 with Loeys-Dietz syndrome, and 12 with vascular Ehlers-Danlos
  syndrome (vEDS). Median (IQR) age was 49.9 years (37.9-59.0), and 107 patients (62.6%)
  were male. One hundred fifty-two (88.9%) were treated for aortic dissections and
  19 (11.1%) for degenerative aneurysms. One hundred thirty-six patients (79.5%) had
  undergone open aortic surgery before the index endovascular repair. In 74 patients
  (43.3%), arch and/or visceral branches were included in the repair. Primary technical
  success was achieved in 168 patients (98.2%), and 30-day mortality was 2.9% (5 patients).
  Survival at 1 and 5 years was 96.2% and 80.6% for Marfan syndrome, 93.8% and 85.2%
  for Loeys-Dietz syndrome, and 75.0% and 43.8% for vEDS, respectively. After a median
  (IQR) follow-up of 4.7 years (1.9-9.2), 91 patients (53.2%) had undergone secondary
  procedures, of which 14 (8.2%) were open conversions. Conclusions and Relevance:
  This study found that endovascular aortic interventions, including redo procedures
  and complex repairs of the aortic arch and visceral aorta, in patients with CTD
  had a high rate of early technical success, low perioperative mortality, and a midterm
  survival rate comparable with reports of open aortic surgery in patients with CTD.
  The rate of secondary procedures was high, but few patients required conversion
  to open repair. Improvements in devices and techniques, as well as ongoing follow-up,
  may result in endovascular treatment for patients with CTD being included in guideline
  recommendations.'
