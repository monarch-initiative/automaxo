input_text: "Matched comparison between external aortic root support and valve-sparing
  root replacement.OBJECTIVES: Differences in indication and technique make a randomised
  comparison between valve-sparing root replacement (VSRR) and personalised external
  aortic root support (PEARS) challenging. We performed a propensity score (PS)-matched
  comparison of PEARS and VSRR for syndromic root aneurysm. METHODS: Patients in the
  PEARS 200 Database and Aortic Valve Insufficiency and ascending aorta Aneurysm InternATiOnal
  Registry (undergoing VSRR) with connective tissue disease operated electively for
  root aneurysm <60 mm with aortic regurgitation (AR) <1/4 were included. Using a
  PS analysis, 80 patients in each cohort were matched. Survival, freedom from reintervention
  and from AR >=2/4 were estimated using a Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS: Median
  follow-up was 25 and 55 months for 159 PEARS and 142 VSRR patients. Seven (4.4%)
  patients undergoing PEARS required an intervention for coronary injury or impingement,
  resulting in one death (0.6%). After VSRR, there were no early deaths, 10 (7%) reinterventions
  for bleeding and 1 coronary intervention. Survival for matched cohorts at 5 years
  was similar (PEARS 98% vs VSRR 99%, p=0.99). There was no difference in freedom
  from valve or ascending aortic/arch reintervention between matched groups. Freedom
  from AR >=2/4 at 5 years in the matched cohorts was 97% for PEARS vs 92% for VSRR
  (p=0.55). There were no type A dissections. CONCLUSIONS: VSRR and PEARS offer favourable
  mid-term survival, freedom from reintervention and preservation of valve function.
  Both treatments deserve their place in the surgical repertoire, depending on a patient's
  disease stage. This study is limited by its retrospective nature and different follow-ups
  in both cohorts."
