input_text: Conclusion of diagnostic odysseys due to inversions disrupting GLI3 and
  FBN1.Many genetic testing methodologies are biased towards picking up structural
  variants (SVs) that alter copy number. Copy-neutral rearrangements such as inversions
  are therefore likely to suffer from underascertainment. In this study, manual review
  prompted by a virtual multidisciplinary team meeting and subsequent bioinformatic
  prioritisation of data from the 100K Genomes Project was performed across 43 genes
  linked to well-characterised skeletal disorders. Ten individuals from three independent
  families were found to harbour diagnostic inversions. In two families, inverted
  segments of 1.2/14.8 Mb unequivocally disrupted GLI3 and segregated with skeletal
  features consistent with Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome. For one family, phenotypic
  blending was due to the opposing breakpoint lying ~45 kb from HOXA13 In the third
  family, long suspected to have Marfan syndrome, a 2.0 Mb inversion disrupting FBN1
  was identified. These findings resolved lengthy diagnostic odysseys of 9-20 years
  and highlight the importance of direct interaction between clinicians and data-analysts.
  These exemplars of a rare mutational class inform future SV prioritisation strategies
  within the NHS Genomic Medicine Service and similar genome sequencing initiatives.
  In over 30 years since these two disease-gene associations were identified, large
  inversions have yet to be described and so our results extend the mutational spectra
  linked to these conditions.
