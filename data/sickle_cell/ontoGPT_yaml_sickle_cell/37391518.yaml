input_text: 'Cervical kyphosis correction in Marfan syndrome: our experience and literature
  review.BACKGROUND: Spinal deformities are common in Marfan syndrome (MFS). They
  usually involve the thoraco-lumbar spine but rarely involves the cervical spine.
  Kyphosis is the common spine deformity of the cervical spine and mandates surgical
  correction as they are at risk of neurological deterioration since they are refractory
  to conservative management. Few studies of surgical correction of spine deformity
  included cervical deformity. OBJECTIVES: To analyze the challenges faced during
  surgery, clinical and radiological outcome, and complications following surgical
  correction for cervical kyphosis in Marfan syndrome. METHODS: We identified that
  5 patients with a diagnosis of MFS with cervical kyphosis who underwent fusion surgery
  between the years 2010 and 2022 were reviewed, retrospectively. We analyzed the
  demographic details, radiological parameters, operative variables (blood loss and
  nuances), perioperative complications, length of stay, clinical and radiological
  outcome, and complications following fusion surgery for cervical kyphosis in MFS.
  RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 16.6 +- 4.72 years (range, 12-23 years). The
  average kyphotic vertebra involved is 3 +- 0.7 bodies (range 2-4) with 2 patients
  with thoracic deformity. All patients underwent surgical deformity correction. All
  patients improved clinically with Nurick grade (pre vs. post: 3.4 vs. 2.2) and mJOA
  (pre vs. post: 8.2 vs. 12.6). There was significant deformity correction from 37.48  to
  9.1 . Mean blood loss encountered was 900 +- 173.2 ml. Perioperative complications:
  wound complication with CSF leak (1). Late complications: ventilator dependence
  (1) and junctional kyphosis (1). Mean length of hospital stay was 103 +- 178.9 days.
  All patients were doing symptomatically better after mean follow-up of 58 +- 28.32
  months. One patient is bedridden and hospitalized. CONCLUSION: Cervical kyphosis
  is a rare spine deformity in patients with MFS, and they usually present with neurological
  deterioration mandating surgical correction. Multidisciplinary approach (pediatrics,
  genetics and cardiology) is required for systematic evaluation of these patients.
  They should be evaluated with necessary imaging to rule out associated spinal deformity
  (atlanto-axial subluxation, scoliosis, and intraspinal pathology like ductal ectasia).
  Our results suggest better surgical outcome in terms of low operative complications
  with neurologic improvement in MFS patients. These patients require regular follow-up
  to identify late complications (instrument failure, non-union, and pseudarthrosis).'
