input_text: 'Valve-sparing versus valve-replacing aortic root replacement in patients
  with aortic root aneurysm.BACKGROUND: Valve-sparing aortic root replacement (VSARR)
  is an alternative to valve-replacing aortic root replacement (VRARR) with valved-conduits
  based on recent guidelines for clinical practice. This study investigated outcomes
  of these two procedures in patients with nonstenotic valves. METHODS: Between January
  7, 2007 and June 30, 2019, 475 patients with aortic root aneurysm without aortic
  stenosis underwent VSARR (151) or VRARR (324) techniques. Propensity score-matching
  (PSM) was used to alleviate confounding. Endpoints were 30-day mortality, 8-year
  survival and reoperation, aortic regurgitation, and valve gradients. RESULTS: PSM
  created 69 pairs of patients with a mean age 52 +- 13 years (10.1% Marfan syndrome,
  34.8% bicuspid aortic valve). There was no statistically significant difference
  in major perioperative morbidity or 30-day mortality (0% VSARR vs. 1.4% VRARR; p
  = 0.316). Overall survival was significantly higher (p = 0.025) in the VSARR group
  versus the VRARR group (8-year estimates 100% vs. 88.9%, respectively), while freedom
  from valve reoperation was similar (p = 0.97, 8-year estimates 90.9% vs. 96.7%,
  respectively). Freedom from > moderate-severe AR was not significantly different
  (p = 0.08, 8-year estimates 90.0% VSARR group vs. 100% VRARR), but mean valve gradients
  at last follow-up were better in the VSARR group (5.9 vs. 13.2 mmHg, p < 0.001).
  CONCLUSIONS: VSARR is a safe operation in patients with aortic root aneurysm and
  nonstenotic aortic valves in the hands of experienced surgeons. Freedom from reoperation
  is similar and the mode of aortic valve failure differs between the two groups.'
