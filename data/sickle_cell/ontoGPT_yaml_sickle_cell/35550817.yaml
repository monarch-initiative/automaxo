input_text: 'Prevalence and Outcomes of Primary Left Ventricular Dysfunction in Marfan
  Syndrome.Even in the absence of significant valvular disease, patients with Marfan
  syndrome (MFS) have evidence of impaired left ventricular (LV) performance, suggestive
  of a primary cardiomyopathy. However, the true prevalence and long-term outcomes
  of this disease process remain largely unknown. We performed a retrospective analysis
  of all adult patients with confirmed MFS followed at Stanford Health Care. Those
  with significant valvular regurgitation, coronary artery disease, or previous cardiac
  surgery were excluded. LV systolic dysfunction was defined as a LV ejection fraction
  (LVEF) <55% on transthoracic echocardiography. A total of 753 patients with confirmed
  MFS were followed up over a median duration of 8 years (interquartile range 4 to
  13). Of those, 241 patients (53% women, 71% White) met inclusion criteria and comprised
  the study cohort. LV systolic dysfunction was present in 30 patients (12%), with
  a median age of onset of 25 years (interquartile range 19 to 37), median EF of 52%
  (interquartile range 48 to 54), and evidence of clinical heart failure (New York
  Heart Association functional class >=II) in 10% of patients. LV systolic dysfunction
  was more common in patients with larger aortic root diameters (>=4.0 cm: Odds ratio
  = 4.5, 95% confidence interval = 1.2 to 17.1) but was not associated with other
  cardiovascular manifestations of MFS or traditional atherosclerotic risk factors.
  In conclusion, apart from significant valvular pathology, LV systolic dysfunction
  was prevalent in MFS from a young age, suggestive of a primary cardiomyopathy. LV
  dysfunction was typically mild and subclinical and occurred more commonly in patients
  with more pronounced aortopathies.'
