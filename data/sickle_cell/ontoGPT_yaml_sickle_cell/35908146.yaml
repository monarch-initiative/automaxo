input_text: 'Surgical outcome of scoliosis in patients with Marfan syndrome.PURPOSE:
  To evaluate clinical and radiographic outcomes after surgical scoliosis correction
  and posterior instrumented fusion in SMF patients. METHODS: A single-center medical
  database was reviewed to identify MF patients who presented with scoliosis from
  2000 to 2015. Patients who underwent spinal fusion surgery were included. Demographic,
  operative and clinical data were reviewed, and the preoperative, postoperative,
  and latest follow-up radiographic parameters were compared. RESULTS: Twelve patients
  were identified (2 males, 10 females) with an average age at surgery of 14.4 +-
  2.6 years. Comorbidities were found in 84.6%. Most patients (90.9%) presented with
  a right thoracic curve. The average preoperative Cobb angle was 75.6 +- 15.5 degrees.
  Posterior instrumented spinal fusion was performed in all patients (1 hook/pedicular
  screw and 11 pedicle screws only). The average follow-up period was 6.8 +- 3.1 years.
  The mean postoperative Cobb angle after surgery and at the final follow-up was 33.4
  +- 18.0 degrees and 35.5 +- 18.4 degrees, respectively. There was a statistically
  significant difference among the preoperative and postoperative Cobb angles (p <
  0.001), but no significant difference among the sagittal angles. Two perioperative
  complications including superficial wound infection and broken rods were observed.
  CONCLUSIONS: Posterior scoliosis correction and instrumented spinal fusion resulted
  in a satisfactory outcome in MF patients. Perioperative complications are not uncommon;
  however, no neurological complication or spinal decompensation was observed in this
  study. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV.'
