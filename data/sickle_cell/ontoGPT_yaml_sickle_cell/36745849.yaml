input_text: 'Predicting axial length in patients with Marfan syndrome and ectopia
  lentis after modified capsular tension ring and intraocular lens implantation.PURPOSE:
  To predict the growth of axial length (AL) in patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS)
  and ectopia lentis (EL). SETTING: Eye and ENT Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai,
  China. DESIGN: Consecutive retrospective case series. METHODS: Eyes were evaluated
  that had modified capsular tension ring and intraocular lens implantation. The rate
  of axial length growth (RALG) was calculated using AL divided by log10-transformed
  age. A multivariable linear regression model of RALG was developed after validation.
  RESULTS: A total of 128 patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS) and EL were enrolled
  with a median follow-up duration of about three years. RALG was independent of age
  between 3 to 15 years old ( P = 0.799) and decreased to zero thereafter ( P = 0.878).
  Preoperative AL was associated with RALG in patients under 15 years old ( P = 0.003).
  Beta values for the final model of RALG were as below: intercept (-9.794) and pre-operative
  AL (0.664). The postoperative AL was predicted as: postAL = preAL + RALG x log 10
  ((postAge + 0.6) / (preAge + 0.6)). The mean prediction error was -0.003 (95%CI,
  -0.386, 0.3791) mm and the mean absolute percentage error was 1.93% (95%CI, 0.73%,
  3.14%). A Python-based calculator was developed to use the predicted AL in selecting
  IOL power and setting undercorrection. CONCLUSIONS: The AL growth of patients with
  MFS followed a logarithmic pattern and ceased at about age 15. A prediction model
  of postoperative AL was established for individual MFS patients between 3-15 years
  old, which could potentially optimize the IOL power selection.'
