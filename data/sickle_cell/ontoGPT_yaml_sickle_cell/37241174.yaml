input_text: Marfan Syndrome beyond Aortic Root-Phenotyping Using Cardiovascular Magnetic
  Resonance Imaging and Clinical Implications.Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an inherited
  autosomal-dominant connective tissue disorder with multiorgan involvement including
  musculoskeletal, respiratory, cardiovascular, ocular, and skin manifestations. Life
  expectancy in patients with MFS is primarily determined by the degree of cardiovascular
  involvement. Aortic disease is the major cardiovascular manifestation of MFS. However,
  non-aortic cardiac diseases, such as impaired myocardial function and arrhythmia,
  have been increasingly acknowledged as additional causes of morbidity and mortality.
  We present two cases demonstrating the phenotypical variation in patients with MFS
  and how CMR (Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance) could serve as a "one stop shop"
  to retrieveS all the necessary information regarding aortic/vascular pathology as
  well as any potential underlying arrhythmogenic substrate or cardiomyopathic process.
