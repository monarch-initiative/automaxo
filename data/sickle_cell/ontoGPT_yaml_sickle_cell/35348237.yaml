input_text: 'Current trends in minimally invasive valve-sparing aortic root replacement-Best
  available evidence.BACKGROUND: Valve-sparing aortic root replacement such as the
  reimplantation (David) procedure is becoming increasingly popular. Despite the fact
  that the procedure is technically more complex, long-term studies demonstrated that
  excellent clinical outcomes in selected patients with durable repair are achievable.
  Benefits of minimal access cardiac surgery have stimulated enthusiasm in the use
  of this access for valve-sparing aortic root replacement. METHODS: We have reviewed
  available literature on the topic of valve-sparing aortic root replacement (David
  procedure) via minimally invasive access through upper hemisternotomy in an attempt
  to assess current trends and to recognize potential advantages of this technique.
  Patient selection and preoperative work-up play important role in performing minimally
  invasive David procedure safely. Surgical technique corresponds to the standard
  David procedure, with a few exceptions related to the minimal access, and is performed
  via upper ministernotomy. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Evidence from nonrandomized observational
  and comparative studies demonstrated excellent clinical outcomes of minimally invasive
  David procedure in selected patients with comparable perioperative mortality and
  outcomes to the conventional technique. To date, David procedure with a minimal
  access technique has been performed in carefully selected patients. We believe it
  could be particularly beneficial to provide younger patients (Marfan syndrome and
  bicuspid aortic valve) with minimally invasive David procedure as it can allow faster
  recovery with improved cosmesis with excellent outcomes. A decision to perform minimally
  invasive David procedure should be individualized to each patient and based on the
  experience of the team. Further large prospective randomized studies with long-term
  follow-up are still needed to confirm durability of minimal access technique.'
