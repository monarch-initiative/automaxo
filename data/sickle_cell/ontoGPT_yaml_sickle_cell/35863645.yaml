input_text: 'Strategies for Treatment of Multiple Brain Aneurysms Without Intraoperative
  Adjuncts.BACKGROUND: Although fairly rare, multiple brain aneurysms are well known
  to occur in certain conditions such as arteriovenous malformations, coarctation
  of the aorta, renal artery stenosis, adult type 3 polycystic kidney disease, as
  well as connective tissue disorders (such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Marfan syndrome,
  and fibromuscular dysplasia). Increased incidence of complications of surgery in
  such situations is expected to be more likely than in surgery for a single aneurysm,
  particularly in the absence of intraoperative guidance with adjuncts. METHODS: We
  report a case of an anterior communicating artery aneurysm, a right middle cerebral
  artery aneurysm, and a right pericallosal aneurysm in a 70-year-old man. All 3 aneurysms
  were clipped through a single-stage approach without the aid of any adjuncts such
  as micro-Doppler ultrasonography, indocyanine green videoangiography, or intraoperative
  digital subtraction angiography. We carried out a literature review for past publications
  on similar reports. RESULTS: The patient made a complete postoperative recovery
  and sustained no neurologic deficits. Out of 388 publications from the literature
  search, only 1 case report described clipping of 2 tandem aneurysms in a 60-year-old
  woman without mentioning any intraoperative adjuncts. CONCLUSIONS: This case illustrates
  that multiple aneurysms can actually be safely operated with adequate planning in
  the absence of these adjuncts, especially in resource-poor regions. This is particularly
  crucial in Africa and most low-and-middle-income countries, where such facilities
  and equipment are not common.'
