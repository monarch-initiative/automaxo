input_text: Late onset sclerotomy dehiscence in a patient with Marfan syndrome presenting
  as recurrent episodes of raised intraocular pressure.A man in his 50s presented
  to the eye emergency department on three separate occasions complaining of blurred
  vision and discomfort in the left eye. He had a history of Marfan syndrome and had
  undergone bilateral 20-gauge (G) pars plana vitrectomy and lensectomy 20 years prior
  for ectopia lentis. On examination he had epithelial corneal oedema, raised intraocular
  pressure >40 mm Hg and conjunctival chemosis, which later appeared as a bleb-like
  conjunctival elevation. Acute treatment with oral acetazolamide and topical ocular
  hypotensive agents produced a marked reduction in intraocular pressure to 2-4 mm
  Hg. A presumed diagnosis of a leaking scleral wound was made. He underwent scleral
  exploration under general anaesthesia and a leaking sclerotomy was uncovered. The
  defect was repaired successfully using a scleral patch graft. Late dehiscence of
  a sclerotomy has been reported rarely in patients with Marfan syndrome. This is
  the first reported case to present atypically with intermittent episodes of raised
  intraocular pressure rather than with hypotony.
