input_text: Contributions of sickle hemoglobin polymer and sickle cell membranes to
  impaired filterability.Sickle cell anemia is a disease of abnormal rheology caused
  by acute and reversible, as well as chronic and irreversible, changes in the properties
  and deformability of sickle erythrocytes. Deformability is determined by several
  factors, including intracellular sickle hemoglobin polymerization, the abnormal
  membrane properties of sickle cells, and the abnormal rheological properties of
  the soluble concentrated hemoglobin solution within dense sickle red blood cells.
  In this study, we used a 5-microns pore nickel mesh filter to evaluate quantitatively
  the effects of these factors on the filterability of erythrocytes containing sickle
  hemoglobin. We used sickle trait and sickle/beta(+)-thalassemia cells, because they
  have minimal membrane abnormalities or density heterogeneity, to investigate the
  effects of polymer formation on rheological properties. We found that filterability
  of these cells is sensitive to small amounts of intracellular polymer and that impaired
  filtration is linearly related to oxygen-dependent polymer formation, up to a polymer
  fraction of 0.3. By increasing the proportion of dense cells in populations of normal
  cells or cells from individuals with sickle syndromes and equilibrating these cells
  with gas ligands, we estimate that polymerization, even at 95% saturation, contributes
  twice as much to impaired filterability of sickle erythrocytes as the abnormal membranes
  in homozygous sickle cell disease. At lower saturation values, the effects of polymer
  are even greater. The viscosity of the concentrated hemoglobin in dense cells had
  the smallest effect, over physiologically relevant saturation values. These results
  emphasize the importance of sickle hemoglobin polymerization in the pathogenesis
  of sickle cell disease and should help define its pathophysiology and responses
  to therapy in quantitative terms.
