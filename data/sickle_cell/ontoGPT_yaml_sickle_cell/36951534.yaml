input_text: 'Acute Type A Aortic Dissection in Adolescents and Young Adults under
  30 Years of Age: Demographics, Etiology and Postoperative Outcomes of 139 cases.BACKGROUND:
  The prevalence and etiology of acute aortic dissection type A in patients <=30 years
  is unknown. The aims of this clinical study were to determine the prevalence and
  potential etiology of acute aortic dissection type A in surgically treated patients
  <=30 years and to evaluate the respective postoperative outcomes in this selective
  group of patients in a large multi-centre study. METHODS: Retrospective data collection
  was performed at the 16 participating international aortic institutions. All patients
  <=30years at the time of dissection onset were included. The postoperative results
  were analysed with regard to connective tissue disease. RESULTS: The overall prevalence
  of acute aortic dissection type A <= 30years was 1.8% (139 out of 7914 patients),
  including 51(36.7%) patients who were retrospectively diagnosed with connective
  tissue disease. Cumulative postoperative mortality was 8.6%, 2.2% and 1.4%, respectively.
  Actuarial survival was 80% at 10 years postoperatively. Non- connective tissue disease
  patients (n = 88) had a significantly higher incidence of arterial hypertension
  (46.6%vs.9.8%;p<0.001) while acute aortic dissection type A affected the aortic
  root (p < 0.001) and arch (p = 0.029) significantly more often in the connective
  tissue disease group. A positive family history of aortic disease was present in
  9.4% of the study cohort(n = 13). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of acute aortic dissection
  type A in surgically treated patients <=30 years is less than 2% with connective
  tissue disease and arterial hypertension as the two most prevalent triggers of acute
  aortic dissection type A. Open surgery may be performed with good early results
  and excellent mid- to long-term outcomes.'
