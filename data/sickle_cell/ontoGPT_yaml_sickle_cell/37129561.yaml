input_text: 'Outcome of Stanford type B dissection in patients with Marfan syndrome.OBJECTIVE:
  To determine the outcome of Stanford type B aortic dissection in patients with Marfan
  syndrome and to evaluate aortic diameters at time of dissection as well as the impact
  of previous aortic root replacement. METHODS: Analysis of all patients with Marfan
  syndrome fulfilling Ghent criteria seen at this institution since 1995 until 2022.
  RESULTS: Thirty-six (19%) out of 188 patients with Marfan syndrome suffered from
  Stanford type B aortic dissection during the study period. Mean aortic diameter
  at time of dissection was 39.0 mm (95% CI: 35.6-42.3). Mean pre-dissection diameter
  (available in 25% of patients) was 32.1 mm (95% CI: 28.0-36.3) and mean expansion
  was 19% (95% CI: 11.9-26.2). There was no correlation between age and diameter at
  time of dissection (<20, 21-30, 31-40, 41-50, 51-60, <61 years; p = 0.78). Freedom-from-intervention
  after dissection was 53%, 44%, 33% at 1, 5 and 10 years. Aortic growth rate in those
  patients that had to undergo intervention within the 1st year after dissection was
  10.2 mm/y (95% CI: 4.4-15.9) compared to 5.8 mm/y (95% CI: 3.3-8.3), p = 0.109 in
  those thereafter. Mean time between dissection and intervention was 1.8 years (95%
  CI: 0.6-3.0). While type B dissection seems more frequent after previous elective
  aortic repair (58% vs 42%), there was no difference between valve-sparing root replacement
  (VSRR) compared to Bentall procedures (HR for VSRR 0.78, 95% CI: 0.31-2.0, p-value
  = 0.61). Mean age of the entire population at end of follow-up was 42 years (95%
  CI: 39.2-44.7). Mean follow-up time was 9 years (95% CI: 7.8-10.4). CONCLUSIONS:
  Stanford type B dissection in patients with Marfan syndrome occurs far below accepted
  thresholds for intervention. Risk for type B dissection is present throughout lifetime
  and two third of patients need an intervention after dissection. There is no difference
  in freedom from type B dissection between a Bentall procedure and a valve-sparing
  root replacement.'
