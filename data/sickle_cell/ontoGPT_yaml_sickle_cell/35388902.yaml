input_text: 'Aortic valve reimplantation in patients with connective tissue syndromes:
  A 15-year follow-up.OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to analyse early- and
  long-term outcomes of aortic valve reimplantation (David operation) in patients
  with heritable thoracic aortic disease. METHODS: This is a retrospective observational
  analysis using data from a prospectively maintained surgical database from March
  2004 to April 2021. Patients with heritable thoracic aortic disease were included
  in the study. RESULTS: A total of 157 patients with aortic root aneurysm with the
  diagnosis of heritable thoracic aortic disease received the David procedure. Marfan
  syndrome was found in 143 (91.1%) patients, Loeys-Dietz in 13 and Ehler-Danlos in
  1 patient. The median age was 35.0 (IQR: 17.5) years and the median ascending aorta
  diameter in the Valsalva sinuses was 48 mm (IQR: 4). A Valsalva graft was used in
  8 patients; the David V technique was performed in the rest of the cases. The median
  follow-up time was 7.3 years [standard deviation: 0.58, 95% confidence interval
  (CI): 6.12-8.05]. Only 2 patients died during the follow-up period. The overall
  survival was 99% (95% CI: 95%; 99%); 98% (95% CI: 92%; 99%); and 98% (95% CI: 92%;
  99%) at 5, 10 and 15 years. Freedom from significant aortic regurgitation (AR> II),
  reintervention and postoperative type-B dissection was 90% (95% CI: 77%; 95%), 96%
  (95% CI: 91%; 99%) and 87% (95% CI: 68%; 95%) at 15 years, respectively. No differences
  were found in any outcome between Marfan syndrome and Loeys-Dietz syndrome. No statistically
  significant differences in survival were found when we compared expected gender-
  and age-specific population survival values. CONCLUSIONS: The David operation is
  an excellent option for the treatment of patients with heritable thoracic aortic
  disease and dilatated aortic root. Surgical expertise in referral centres is essential
  to achieve the best long-term results.'
