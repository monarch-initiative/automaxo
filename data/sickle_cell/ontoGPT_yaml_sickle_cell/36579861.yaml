input_text: 'Twenty-year experience of aortic valve reimplantation using the Valsalva
  graft.OBJECTIVES: Over the past 20 years, valve-sparing aortic root replacement
  has aroused increasing interest because of a progressive attitude towards the preservation
  of natural tissue. Aortic reimplantation is the most used technique to spare the
  valve, allowing simultaneously aortic root replacement and aortic annular stabilization.
  The reimplantation into a graft with sinuses guarantees an optimal anatomic and
  functional reconstruction with established good results at 15 years. The aim of
  this study is to report the world longest follow-up (up to 20 years) of aortic valve
  reimplantation using the Valsalva graft. METHODS: From February 2000 to December
  2021, 265 consecutive patients with aortic root aneurysm received aortic valve reimplantation
  using the Valsalva graft. From 2018, leaflet plication with the routine use of calliper
  was performed. For each patient, we performed both intraoperative and post-procedural
  transoesophageal echocardiography. All patients were followed with clinical assessment
  and echocardiography. The mean duration of follow-up was 85 +- 63 months. RESULTS:
  The study cohort had a median age of 55 +- 18 and 87.2% were male. The aortic root
  aneurysm was associated to bicuspid aortic valve in 18.9% of patients and to Marfan
  syndrome in 10.6% of cases. 55.9% had an aortic regurgitation >= 2+. Overall survival
  at 15 was 87.6 +- 3.4. Freedom from cardiac death was stable at 99.6 +- 0.4 at 5,
  10 and 15 years. Freedom from recurrent AR >=3+ and freedom from reoperation remained
  stable at 10 and 15 years at 92.2 +- 2.1 and 95.9 +- 1.6, respectively. There was
  a minimal incidence of infective endocarditis (0.8%), thromboembolism (2.2%) and
  haemorrhage (2.0%). Six out of 7 patients requiring reoperation had surgery in the
  first period of our experience (last in 2004). Early suboptimal results had a negative
  effect on residual aortic regurgitation. Moreover, we hypothesized that the routine
  use of calliper may have contributed to a further improvement of the outcome, even
  if these data need to be confirmed by a longer follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The first
  long-term follow-up after aortic valve reimplantation using the Valsalva graft demonstrated
  excellent results. These long-term results gradually improved with learning curve,
  remaining stable during the second decade of observation. The systematic use of
  calliper may have contributed to a further improvement of the outcome.'
