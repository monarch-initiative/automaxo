input_text: "Thoracic aorta diameters in Marfan patients: Intraindividual comparison
  of 3D modified relaxation-enhanced angiography without contrast and triggering (REACT)
  with transthoracic echocardiography.OBJECTIVE: To compare the measurement of aortic
  diameters using a novel flow-independent MR-Angiography (3D modified Relaxation-Enhanced
  Angiography without Contrast and Triggering (modified REACT)) and transthoracic
  echocardiography (TTE) in Marfan syndrome (MFS) patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS:
  This retrospective, single-center analysis included 46 examinations of 32 MFS patients
  (mean age 37.5 +- 11.3 years, 17 women, no prior aortic surgery) who received TTE
  and 3D modified REACT (ECG- and respiratory-triggering, Compressed SENSE factor
  9 for acceleration of image acquisition) of the thoracic aorta. Aortic diameters
  (sinus of Valsalva (SV), sinotubular junction (STJ), and ascending aorta (AoA))
  were independently measured by two cardiologists in TTE (leading-edge) and two radiologists
  in modified REACT (inner-edge, using multiplanar reconstruction). Intraclass correlation
  coefficient, Bland-Altman analyses, and Pearson's correlation (r) were used to assess
  agreement between observers and methods. RESULTS: Interobserver correlation at the
  SV, STJ, and AoA were excellent for both, TTE (ICC = 0.95-0.98) and modified REACT
  (ICC = 0.99-1.00). There was no significant difference between TTE and modified
  REACT for diameters measured at the SV (39.24 +- 3.24 mm vs. 39.63 +- 3.76 mm; p
  = 0.26; r = 0.78) and the STJ (35.16 +- 4.47 mm vs. 35.37 +- 4.74 mm; p = 0.552;
  r = 0.87). AoA diameters determined by TTE were larger than in modified REACT (34.29
  +- 5.31 mm vs. 30.65 +- 5.64 mm; p < 0.01; r = 0.74). The mean scan time of modified
  REACT was 05:06 min +- 02:47 min, depending on the patient's breathing frequency
  and heart rate. CONCLUSIONS: Both TTE and modified REACT showed a strong correlation
  for all aortic levels; however, at the AoA, diameters were larger using TTE, mostly
  due to the limited field of view of the latter with measurements being closer to
  the aortic valve. Given the excellent interobserver correlation and the strong agreement
  with TTE, modified REACT represents an attractive method to depict the thoracic
  aorta in MFS patients."
