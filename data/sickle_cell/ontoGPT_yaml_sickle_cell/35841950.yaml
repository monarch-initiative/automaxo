input_text: 'Improved Outcomes of Reimplantation vs Remodeling in Marfan Syndrome:
  A Propensity-Matched Study.BACKGROUND: Valve-sparing root replacement (VSRR) has
  excellent outcomes when performed in experienced centers in well-selected patients.
  It is suggested that reimplantation of the aortic valve may have better durability
  than remodeling in patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS), although long-term comparative
  data are limited. METHODS: Between 1988 and 2018, 194 patients with MFS underwent
  VSRR at our institution. From these, we derived a propensity-matched cohort of 68
  patients (44 who underwent reimplantation and 24 who had remodeling). Early outcomes
  included death and perioperative complications. Late outcomes were survival, probability
  of aortic insufficiency, and reintervention up to 20 years of follow-up. Median
  follow-up was 17.8 years (interquartile range, 12.0-20.6 years) for the entire matched
  cohort. RESULTS: Baseline variables were similar between reimplantation and remodeling
  patients after matching: age (39 +- 12 vs 40 +- 13 years, P = .75) and male sex
  (28 [64%] vs 15 [63%], P = 1.0). Similar 20-year survival was observed after reimplantation
  compared with remodeling (82% vs 72%, P = .20), whereas the probability of developing
  greater than mild aortic insufficiency at 20 years was increased after remodeling
  (5.8% vs 13%, P = .013). More patients underwent reoperation on the aortic valve
  after a remodeling procedure than after reimplantation of the aortic valve (18%
  vs 0%, P = .018). CONCLUSIONS: VSRR provides excellent long-term survival and freedom
  from valve-related complications outcomes in patients with MFS. Reimplantation of
  the aortic valve was associated with a lower risk of aortic valve reoperation and
  aortic insufficiency than the remodeling procedure after 2 decades of follow-up.'
