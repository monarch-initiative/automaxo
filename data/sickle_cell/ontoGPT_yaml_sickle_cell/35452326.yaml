input_text: Complex and Successful Management of a Symptomatic Isolated Abdominal
  Aortic Aneurysm in a Pregnant Woman with Marfan Syndrome.Aortopathies associated
  to Marfan syndrome (MFS) are important causes of maternal death during pregnancy.
  We present a 27-year-old and 24-week pregnant MFS woman who arrived to the emergency
  department with increasing abdominal pain; an obstetric ultrasound showed an Abdominal
  Aortic Aneurysm (AAA), a multislice computed tomography angiography (CTA) confirmed
  and demonstrated a 7.3 centimeter (cm) infrarenal AAA without evidence of dissection.
  A multidisciplinary committee determined that an open repair would lead to a significantly
  high maternal-fetal morbidity and mortality. Although endovascular repair (EVAR)
  in MFS patients remains controversial, an urgent bridge therapy was considered to
  be the best option. She was transferred to the angiography suite for EVAR to prevent
  AAA rupture and ensure a satisfactory pregnancy. The patient and fetus presented
  no complications during the procedure and were discharged 3 days later. She continued
  her pregnancy without eventualities and an elective C-section was performed on week
  36. A CTA imaging at 12 months revealed type 1A and 3 endoleaks, we decided to perform
  endograft explant and a definitive open repair, there were no complications during
  the procedure, the patient is currently asymptomatic. Our case illustrates a complex
  decision and management that successfully avoid morbidity and mortality of a MFS
  mother and her product; additionally, this experience reinforces the need for lifelong
  and close surveillance in these patients.
