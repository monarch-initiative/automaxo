input_text: 'Early and Long-Term Outcomes of Young Adult Patients <=30 Years Old with
  Acute Type A Aortic Dissection.OBJECTIVES: To investigate the early and long-term
  outcomes after total arch replacement and frozen elephant trunk implantation in
  adult patients <=30 years with acute type A aortic dissection. METHODS: All young
  adult patients (<=30 years) with acute type A aortic dissection who underwent total
  arch replacement and frozen elephant trunk between 2009 and 2017 were enrolled.
  The end-points were major organ morbidity and mortality, aortic-related events,
  and reoperation. RESULTS: The mean age of all 83 patients was 25.9 (standard deviation,
  3.3) years. The in-hospital mortality was 9.64% (8/83), and 9 (10.8%) patients required
  re-exploration for bleeding. The aortic-related events risk was 42.7% (32/75) and
  aortic reoperation risk was 17.3% (13/75). Overall survival was 85.5% (95% CI, 75.9%-91.5%)
  at 5 years and 75.9% (95% CI, 63.3%-84.7%) at 10 years. The cumulative incidence
  of aortic-related events was 35% (95% CI, 24%-47%) at 5 years and 58% (95% CI, 36%-75%)
  at 10 years; the cumulative reoperation rate was 15% (95% CI, 7.9%-24%) at 5 years
  and 17% (95% CI, 9.2%-27%) at 10 years. Marfan syndrome significantly increased
  the aortic-related events (P = 0.036) and reoperation (P = 0.041) risks. CONCLUSIONS:
  Despite extensive repair in young acute type A aortic dissection patients, the late
  aortic dilatation and reoperation risk remain high. The total arch replacement and
  frozen elephant trunk procedure achieved satisfactory early outcomes and reduced
  late aortic dilatation and reoperation in young patients compared with other records.
  Close follow-up and aggressive early reintervention are essential for patients with
  aortic-related risk factors early in life.'
