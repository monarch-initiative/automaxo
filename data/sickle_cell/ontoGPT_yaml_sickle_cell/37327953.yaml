input_text: 'A Systematic Review Supporting the Society for Vascular Surgery Guidelines
  on the Management of Heritable Aortopathies.BACKGROUND: To support the development
  of clinical practice guidelines on the management of patients with genetic aortopathies
  and arteriopathies, a writing committee from the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS)
  has commissioned this systematic review. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review
  and searched multiple databases for studies addressing six questions identified
  by the SVS guideline committee about evaluating and managing patients with genetic
  aortopathies and arteriopathies. Studies were selected and appraised by pairs of
  independent reviewers. RESULTS: We included 12 studies in this systematic review.
  We did not identify studies about the long-term outcomes of endovascular repair
  for aortic aneurysm in patients with heritable aortopathy or about new aortic events
  in pregnant women with a history of aortic dissection or aneurysm. A small case
  series demonstrated 100% survival rate and 100% aortic intervention-free survival
  at 15 months (range 7-28 months) following endograft repair for type B aortic dissection.
  A positive genetic diagnosis was discovered in 36% of patients with aortic aneurysms
  and dissections who had no risk factors for hereditary aortopathies, and these patients
  had a mortality rate of 11% at a median follow-up duration of 5 months. Black patients
  had lower 30-day mortality than White patients (5.6% vs. 9%; respectively), but
  they had a higher overall aortic reintervention rate at 30-day post-aortic dissection
  repair (47% vs. 27%; respectively). Aortic reinterventions due to aneurysmal expansion
  and endoleak at 30 days were higher in Black patients than White patients. The certainty
  of evidence was judged to be very low across all the outcomes evaluated in this
  systematic review. CONCLUSION: The available evidence suggests high survival after
  TEVAR for type B aortic dissection in young patients with heritable aortopathies
  but with limited long-term follow-up. Genetic testing in patients with acute aortic
  aneurysms and dissections had a high yield. It was positive for most patients with
  risk factors for hereditary aortopathies and in over a third for all other patients,
  and was associated with new aortic events within 15 years.'
