input_text: '[Clinical manifestations and genetic analysis of 4 patients with variants
  of FBN1 gene].OBJECTIVE: To explore the genetic basis for four patients suspected
  for Marfan syndrome (MFS). METHODS: Four male patients with suspected MFS and their
  family members who were treated at West China Second Hospital of Sichuan University
  from September 12, 2019 to March 27, 2021 were selected as the study subjects. Peripheral
  venous blood samples were collected from the patients and their parents or other
  pedigree members for the extraction of genomic DNA. Whole exome sequencing was carried
  out, and candidate variants were validated by Sanger sequencing. The pathogenicity
  of the variants was determined based on the guidelines from the American College
  of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG). RESULTS: Genetic testing revealed that
  all four patients have harbored variants of the FBN1 gene, including c.430_433del
  (p.His144fs) deletional variant in exon 5, c.493C>T (p.Arg165*) nonsense variant
  in exon 6, c.5304_5306del (p.Asp1768del) deletional variant in exon 44 and c.5165C>G
  (p.Ser1722Cys) missense variant in exon 42. According to the ACMG guidelines, the
  c.430_433del and c.493C>T were classified as pathogenic variants (PVS1+PM2_Supporting+PP4;
  PVS1+PS1+PS2+PM2_Supporting+PP4). c.5304_5306del and c.5165C>G were classified as
  likely pathogenic variants (PS2+PM2_Supporting+PM4+PP4; PS2_Moderate+PS1+PM1+PM2_Supporting).
  CONCLUSION: The c.430_433del and c.5304_5306del variants of the FBN1 gene identified
  in this study were unreported previously. Above results have enriched the variation
  spectrum of the FBN1 gene and provided a basis for genetic counseling and prenatal
  diagnosis of patients with MFS and acromicric dysplasia.'
