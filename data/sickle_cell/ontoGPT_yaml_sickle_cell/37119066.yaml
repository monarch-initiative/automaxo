input_text: 'Aortic Dissection During Pregnancy and Puerperium: Contemporary Incidence
  and Outcomes in the United States.Background Aortic dissection (AD) during pregnancy
  and puerperium is a rare catastrophe with devastating consequences for both parent
  and fetus. Population-level incidence trends and outcomes remain relatively undetermined.
  Methods and Results We queried a US population-based health care database, the National
  Inpatient Sample, and identified all patients with a pregnancy-related AD hospitalization
  from 2002 to 2017. In total, 472 pregnancy-related AD hospitalizations (mean age,
  30.9+-0.6 years) were identified from 68 514 000 pregnancy-related hospitalizations
  (0.69 per 100 000 pregnancy-related hospitalizations), with 107 (22.7%) being type
  A and 365 (77.3%) being type B. The incidence of AD appeared to increase over the
  16-year study period but was not statistically significant (P for trend >0.05).
  Marfan syndrome, primary hypertension, and preeclampsia/eclampsia were found in
  21.9%, 14.4%, and 11.5%, respectively. On multivariable logistic regression analysis,
  Marfan syndrome was associated with the highest risk of developing AD during pregnancy
  and puerperium (adjusted odds ratio, 3469.36 [95% CI, 1767.84-6831.75]; P<0.001).
  The in-hospital mortalities of AD, type A AD, and type B AD were 7.3%, 4.3%, and
  8.1%, respectively. Length of hospital stay for the AD, type A AD, and type B AD
  groups were 7.7+-0.8, 10.4+-1.9, and 6.9+-0.9 days, respectively. Conclusions We
  quantified population-level incidence and in-hospital mortality in the United States
  and observed an increase in the incidence of pregnancy-related AD. In contrast,
  its in-hospital mortality appears lower than that of non-pregnancy-related AD.'
