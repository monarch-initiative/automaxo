input_text: 'Early and midterm results of frozen elephant trunk operation with Evita
  open stent-graft in patients with Marfan syndrome: results of a multicentre study.BACKGROUND:
  Endovascular treatment of patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS) is not recommended.
  Hybrid procedures such as frozen elephant trunk (FET), which combines stent-graft
  deployment with an integrated non-stented fabric graft for proximal grafting and
  suturing, have not been previously evaluated. The aim of this study was to assess
  the safety and feasibility of FET operation in patients with MFS. METHODS: Patients
  enrolled in the International E-vita Open Registry (IEOR) who underwent FET procedure
  between January 2001 and February 2020 meeting Ghent criteria for MFS were included
  in the study. Early and midterm results were retrospectively analyzed. Preoperative,
  postoperative and follow-up computed tomography angiography scans were analysed.
  RESULTS: We analyzed 37 patients [mean age 38 +- 11 years, 65% men]. Acute or chronic
  aortic dissection was present in 35 (95%) patients (14 and 21 patients respectively).
  Two (5%) patients had an aneurysm without dissection. Malperfusion syndrome was
  present in 4 patients. Twenty-nine (78%) patients had history of aortic surgical
  interventions. The 30-day and in-hospital mortality amounted to 8 and 14% respectively.
  False lumen exclusion was present in 73% in stented segment in last postoperative
  CT. The overall 5-year survival was 71% and freedom from reintervention downstream
  was 58% at 5 years. Of the nine patients who required reintervention for distal
  aortic disease, one patient died. CONCLUSIONS: FET operation for patients with MFS
  can be performed with acceptable mortality and morbidity. In long-term follow-up
  no reinterventions on the aortic arch were required. FET allows for easier second
  stage operations providing platform for surgical and endovascular reinterventions.'
