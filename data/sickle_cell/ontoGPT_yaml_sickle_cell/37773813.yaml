input_text: 'Reduced volume and altered composition of paraspinal muscles in Marfan
  syndrome: A retrospective cohort study.Retrospective cohort study. Spinal deformities
  in patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS) are distinct from those in patients with
  idiopathic scoliosis (IS). It is more prone to progression and more likely to present
  with sagittal malalignment than IS. However, the etiology of this characteristic
  spinal deformity in MFS remains unclear. This study aimed to determine the spinal
  musculature characteristics in patients with MFS on the hypothesis that the paraspinal
  muscles of patients with MFS would be qualitatively or quantitatively different
  from those of patients with IS. Seventeen consecutive patients with MFS aged 25
  years or younger undergoing surgery for scoliosis in our hospital were compared
  with age- and sex-matched patients with IS undergoing surgery for scoliosis. The
  body size-adjusted relative cross-sectional area (rCSA), fatty infiltration ratio
  (FI%), and relative functional cross-sectional area (rFCSA) of the psoas muscles
  (PM) and paravertebral muscles (PVM) at L3/4 and L4/5 were measured using preoperative
  T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Functional CSA was defined as total CSA
  minus the fatty infiltration area of each muscle and rFCSA was calculated as the
  body size-adjusted functional CSA. The rCSA of the PM at L3/4 and L4/5 was significantly
  smaller in the MFS group than in the IS group (L3/4, P = .021; L4/5, P = .002).
  The FI% of the PM at L4/5 was significantly higher in the MFS group (P = .044).
  Consequently, the rFCSA of the PM at L3/4 and L4/5 and the rFCSA of the PVM at L3/4
  in the MFS group were significantly smaller than those in the IS group (PM at L3/4,
  P = .021; PM at L4/5, P = .001; PVM at L3/4, P = .025). Compared with patients with
  IS, patients with MFS exhibited significantly decreased body-size-adjusted CSA of
  the PM and reduced body-size-adjusted functional CSA of the PVM and PM. These findings
  may partially explain the characteristics of distinctive spinal deformities in patients
  with MFS.'
