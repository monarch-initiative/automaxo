input_text: 'The impact of age in acute type A aortic dissection: a retrospective
  study.BACKGROUND: Acute type A aortic dissection (aTAAD) is a lethal disease and
  age is an important risk factor for outcomes. This retrospective study was to analyze
  the impact of age stratification in aTAAD, and to provide clues for surgeons when
  they make choices of therapy strategies. METHODS: From January 2011 to December
  2019, 1092 aTAAD patients from Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital received surgical therapy.
  Patients were divided into 7 groups according to every ten-year interval (20-80
  s). The differences between the groups were analyzed in terms of the baseline preoperative
  conditions, surgical methods and postoperative outcomes of patients of different
  age groups. During a median follow-up term of 17 months, the survival rates were
  compared among 7 groups through Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS: The median age was
  52.0 years old in whole cohort. The multiple comorbidities were more common in old
  age groups (60 s, 70 s, 80 s), while the 20 s group patients had the highest proportion
  of Marfan syndrome (28.1%). Preoperative hypotension was highest in 80 s (16.7%,
  P = 0.038). Young age groups (20-60 s) had a higher rate of root replacement and
  total arch replacement, which led to a longer duration of operation and hypothermic
  circulation arrest. The overall mortality was 14.1%, the tendency of mortality was
  increased with age except 20 s group (33.3% in 80 s, P = 0.016). The postoperative
  morbidity of gastrointestinal bleeding and bowel ischemia were 16.7% and 11.1% in
  80 s group. CONCLUSIONS: Age is a major impact factor for aTAAD surgery. Old patients
  presented more comorbidities before surgery, the mortality and complications rate
  were significantly higher even with less invasive and conservative surgical therapy.
  But the favorable long-term survival indicated that the simple or less extensive
  arch repair is the preferred surgery for patients over 70 years old.'
