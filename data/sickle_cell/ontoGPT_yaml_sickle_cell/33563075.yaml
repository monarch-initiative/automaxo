input_text: 'Sickle cell anemia/sickle cell disease and pregnancy outcomes among ethnic
  tribes in India: an integrative mini-review.Objective: To evaluate the studies which
  have reported the prevalence of maternal complications and outcomes for women with
  SCA/SCD. Healthy populations make a healthy community and improve the future for
  mankind. Pregnant women are an essential segment of humanity as they bear the fetus
  and supply nutrition for their development throughout the gestational period. Their
  health status and disease conditions also play a vital role in deciding the future
  of the offspring.Materials and methods: The Mesh terms: "Haemoglobinopathies" +
  "Sickle cell anemia" + "Sickle cell disease" + "Ethnic tribes" + "Pregnancy outcomes"
  + "India" were used to search the literature available from public databases such
  as "PubMed", "PubMed Central" "Google Scholar", "Science Direct" and "Scopus" and
  the same is checked for removing repetitions. The data was extracted and collected
  literature was thoroughly analysed. SCD/SCA is a commonly prevalent hereditary hemoglobinopathy
  disease and is related to augmented risk factors and premature mortality.Results:
  SCD severely affects pregnancy, which leads to the elevated occurrence of perinatal
  and maternal outcomes such as pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, abortions, intrauterine
  growth retardation (IUGR), etc., and sufficient care during the pregnancy guarantees
  an improved outcome. Due to the best health care conveniences, availability of drugs
  such as hydroxyurea, antibiotic prophylaxis, and vaccination, the life expectancy
  of SCD patients has greatly improved in recent times though directly related to
  the access and services available at the healthcare facilities for the needy and
  poor. Moreover, the latest innovations in the fields of prenatal screening and preimplantation
  genetic diagnosis (PGD), facilitate partners suffering from SCA/SCD to have a healthy
  child. There are no available studies on the prevalence of SCA/SCD in pregnant women
  among ethnic tribal populations from India.Conclusion: This review article is focused
  on the effects of SCA/SCD on pregnancy outcomes, the consistent follow-up, routine
  check-ups and successful management of complications throughout pregnancy, the various
  diagnostic methods toward preventive methods, curative and management therapeutic
  strategies and also defines the perinatal and maternal outcomes in the ethnic tribal
  populations of India.'
