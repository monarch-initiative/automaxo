input_text: Heterogenous improvements in endothelial function by sub-blood pressure
  lowering doses of ARBs result in major anti-aortic root remodeling effects.Low basal
  nitric oxide (NO) production is associated with a dysfunctional endothelium and
  vascular diseases. We have shown that some angiotensin II (AngII) receptor type
  1 (AT1R) blockers (ARBs), a group of clinic-approved blood pressure (BP)-lowering
  medications, are also capable of activating endothelial function acutely and chronically,
  both ex vivo and in vivo, in pleiotropic, AngII-independent fashions, which suggested
  that endothelial function enhancement with ARBs may be independent of their well-documented
  BP lowering properties. Herein, we attempt to identify the most potent ARB at activating
  endothelial function when administered at sub-BP-lowering doses and determine its
  anti-aortic root remodeling properties in a model of Marfan syndrome (MFS). Amongst
  the 8 clinically available ARBs tested, only telmisartan and azilsartan induced
  significant (70% and 49%, respectively) NO-dependent inhibition of aortic contractility
  when administered for 4 weeks at sub-BP lowering, EC5 doses. Low-dose telmisartan
  (0.47 mg/kg) attenuated MFS-associated aortic root widening, medial thickening,
  and elastic fiber fragmentation to the same degree as high-dose telmisartan (10
  mg/kg) despite wide differences in BP lowering between the two doses. Our study
  suggests that telmisartan is the most potent ARB at promoting increased endothelial
  function at low sub-BP doses and that it retained major aortic root widening inhibition
  activities. ARBs may enhance endothelial function independently from BP-lowering
  pathways, which could lead to new therapeutic approaches.
