input_text: Redo aortic arch replacement through a second transcostal approach for
  closure of type 1A endoleak after endovascular treatment of type B aortic dissection
  in Marfan syndrome.A 41-year-old woman with Marfan syndrome suffering from chronic
  expanding type A dissection of the distal aortic arch and pectus excavatum underwent
  aortic arch replacement through a left parasternal approach. We demonstrate that
  this approach is also feasible in complex redo surgery on the aortic arch in selected
  patients.
