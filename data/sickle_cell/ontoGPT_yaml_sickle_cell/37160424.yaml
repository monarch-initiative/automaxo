input_text: 'Longitudinal follow-up by MR angiography reveals progressive dilatation
  of the distal aorta after aortic root replacement in Marfan syndrome.OBJECTIVES:
  To define and compare growth rates of the distal aorta in Marfan patients with and
  without aortic root replacement using serial MR angiography (MRA). METHODS: We retrospectively
  included 136 Marfan patients with a total of 645 MRAs who underwent a median of
  five MRAs (range: 2-13) at 1.5 T and 3 T in annual intervals. Of these, 41 patients
  (34.8 +- 12 years) had undergone aortic root replacement. The remaining 95 patients
  (29.0 +- 17 years) still had a native aorta and served as the control group. Thoracic
  aortic diameters were independently measured at eleven predefined levels. Estimated
  growth rates were calculated using a mixed effects model adjusted for sex, age,
  BMI, and medication. RESULTS: Marfan patients with aortic root replacement revealed
  the highest mean estimated growth rate in the proximal descending aorta (0.77 mm/year,
  CI: 0.31-1.21). Mean growth rates at all levels of the distal thoracic aorta were
  significantly higher in patients with aortic root replacement (0.28-0.77 mm/year)
  when compared to patients without aortic root replacement (0.03-0.07 mm/year) (all
  p < 0.001). Antihypertensive medication, gender, and BMI had no significant impact
  on the distal aortic growth rates. CONCLUSION: Distal thoracic aortic diameters
  increase at a significantly higher rate in Marfan patients with aortic root replacement
  compared to Marfan patients without aortic root replacement. Further studies are
  warranted to investigate if the increased growth rate of the distal thoracic aorta
  after aortic root replacement is caused by altered hemodynamics due to the rigid
  aortic root graft or due to the general genetic disposition of post-operative Marfan
  patients. CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: High growth rates of the distal aorta after
  aortic root replacement underline the need for careful life-long aortic imaging
  of Marfan patients after aortic root replacement. KEY POINTS:   Aortic growth rates
  in Marfan patients with aortic root replacement are highest in the mid-aortic arch,
  the proximal- and mid-descending aorta.   Growth rates of the distal thoracic aorta
  are significantly higher in Marfan patients with aortic root replacement compared
  to Marfan patients without aortic root replacement.   Antihypertensive medication,
  gender, and BMI have no significant impact on distal aortic growth rates in Marfan
  patients.'
