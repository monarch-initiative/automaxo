input_text: 'Extrathoracic Aneurysms in Marfan Syndrome: A Systematic Review of the
  Literature.BACKGROUND: Marfan syndrome (MS) most often shows as thoracic aortic
  aneurysm (TAA) or aortic dissection, but it may also involve other vascular territories.
  This study aimed to identify those extrathoracic vascular manifestations most frequently
  associated with MS. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature with Preferred
  Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses criteria was carried out.
  The following databases were included: MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Cumulative
  Index of Nursing and Health Sciences Literature (CINHAL); Spanish database MEDESY
  Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). RESULTS: A total of 10,008
  articles were identified, leaving 155 for the first stage of data analysis (total
  incidence of aneurysms) and 83 for the second (descriptive data analysis). Overall,
  518 aneurysms were identified: 149 in the head and neck, 94 in the extremities,
  and 275 in the aortic, iliac, and visceral sectors. Mostly, they were simultaneously
  discovered during studies of the TAA. In the abdominal aorta, the presentation with
  rupture in 11 of 32 patients stands out. Resection and bypass were the most frequently
  used methods for repair in the treated cases. CONCLUSIONS: Although its frequency
  in the general population is unknown, this systematic review suggests that extrathoracic
  aneurysmal arterial involvement in the MS may be more frequent than expected. We
  believe screening for aneurysms in other vascular sectors may be advisable, especially
  in patients with MS and TAA.'
