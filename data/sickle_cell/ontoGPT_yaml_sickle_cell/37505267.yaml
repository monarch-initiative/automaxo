input_text: 'Abnormal Left Ventricular Strain Correlates with Left Ventricular Dysfunction
  but not Aortic Pathology in Marfan Syndrome in Children.Cardiomyopathy is a complication
  in adults with Marfan syndrome (MFS). Early recognition of MFS patients at high
  risk of cardiomyopathy could impact monitoring and treatment. Abnormal ventricular
  strain has been associated with impaired ventricular function among adults with
  MFS but remains understudied in children. We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of
  patients with MFS undergoing cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) performed
  in 2003-2018 at age < 19 years. Correlations were evaluated between initial global
  circumferential strain (GCS) and global longitudinal strain (GLS) and the outcomes
  of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), aortic root z-score, and vertebral
  artery tortuosity index corrected for height (VTI-h), all measured from CMR, using
  Spearman correlation. In those with serial CMR, the ability of ventricular strain
  to predict development of abnormal LVEF within a 5-year period was assessed. A total
  of 31 subjects were included (median age at initial CMR 13.5 years, Q1Q3 10.7-16.2
  years), with 48% (n = 15) having LVEF < 55%. Worse GCS and worse GLS were associated
  with lower LVEF (rho = - 0.629, p < 0.001 and rho = - 0.411, p = 0.030, respectively).
  A clinical cutoff of GCS = - 34% predicted LVEF < 55% with sensitivity = 80% and
  specificity = 50%. Neither GCS nor GLS was associated with aortic root z-score (GCS:
  p = 0.524; GLS: p = 0.624) nor VTI-h (GCS: p = 0.949; GLS: p = 0.593). Of those
  with LVEF >= 55%, initial GCS and GLS did not differ between those with later normal
  versus abnormal LVEF (GCS: p = 0.505; GLS: p = 0.232). In this cohort, abnormal
  LV strain was associated with abnormal LVEF, but not with aortic dilation or low
  LVEF within the 5 years post-CMR.'
