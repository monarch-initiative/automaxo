Multiple manifestations of LDS were present, including easy bruising, aortic root dilatation, multiple areas of vessel tortuosity, and joint laxity. The patient's medications included a beta-blocker and an angiotensin II receptor antagonist for prophylaxis against further aortic root dilatation due to his LDS. He experienced intraoperative hemodynamic instability and became pulseless during an orthopedic procedure, which had to be abandoned. Anesthesia was reattempted 2 days after cessation of the patient's antihypertensive medications and was successful with only minor postoperative hypertension. ",

                    "abstract": "Heritable thoracic aortic diseases (HTAD) are rare pathologies associated with thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissection, which can be syndromic or non-syndromic. They may result from genetic defects. Associated genes identified to date are classified into those encoding components of the (a) extracellular matrix (b) TGFbeta pathway and (c) smooth muscle contractile mechanism. Timely diagnosis allows for prompt aortic surveillance and prophylactic surgery, hence improving life expectancy and reducing maternal complications as well as providing reassurance to family members when a diagnosis is ruled out. This document is an expert opinion reflecting strategies put forward by medical experts and patient representatives involved in the HTAD Rare Disease Working Group of VASCERN. It aims to provide a patient pathway that improves patient care by diminishing time to diagnosis, facilitating the establishment of a correct diagnosis using molecular genetics when possible, excluding the diagnosis in unaffected persons through appropriate family screening and avoiding overuse of resources. It is being recommended that patients are referred to an expert centre for further evaluation if they meet at least one of the following criteria: (1) thoracic aortic dissection (<70 years if hypertensive; all ages if non-hypertensive), (2) thoracic aortic aneurysm (all adults with Z score >3.5 or 2.5-3.5 if non-hypertensive or hypertensive and <60 years; all children with Z score >3), (3) family history of HTAD with/without a pathogenic variant in a gene linked to HTAD, (4) ectopia lentis without other obvious explanation and (5) a systemic score of >5 in adults and >3 in children. Aortic imaging primarily relies on transthoracic echocardiography with magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography as needed. Genetic testing should be considered in those with a high suspicion of underlying genetic aortopathy. Though panels vary among centers, for patients with thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection or systemic features these should include genes with a definitive or strong association to HTAD. Genetic cascade screening and serial aortic imaging should be considered for family screening and follow-up. In conclusion, the implementation of these strategies should help standardise the diagnostic work-up and follow-up of patients with suspected HTAD and the screening of their relatives.",

METHODS: Clinical data and lumbosacral imaging of 138 patients with LDS were reviewed. Spondylolisthesis (L4-L5 or L5-S1) and spondylolysis were characterized by multimodal imaging and correlated with clinical data. Treatments and outcomes were characterized for patients with spondylolisthesis. Associations were determined using the Fisher exact, Mann-Whitney, and Student t tests (alpha=0.05). RESULTS: Twenty-four patients (17%) had spondylolysis and 23 (17%) had spondylolisthesis. Median age at spondylolisthesis diagnosis was 11 (interquartile range, 9.5) years. In patients in whom measurement was possible (n=20), mean (+-SD) slip was 48% (+-35%). Nineteen patients had L5-S1 slip and 4 had L4-L5 slip. Of the patients with spondylolisthesis, 5 had no evidence of spondylolysis; of those with spondylolysis, all but 6 had spondylolisthesis. Eleven patients with spondylolisthesis underwent posterior spinal fusion (PSF) to treat slip progression, pain, and/or neurological deficit. Spondylolisthesis recurred in 1 patient who underwent PSF with bone graft arthrodesis alone (no instrumentation). The other 10 patients underwent PSF with instrumentation and fusion. Three patients additionally underwent Bohlman interbody fusion. Two patients developed implant failure. S2 fixation was performed at revision to achieve fusion in these patients. Mean Meyerding grade improved in patients who underwent arthrodesis, from 3.9 (+-1.2) to 1.9 (+-1.3) (P=0.002).

No significant associations between LDS type and lumbosacral abnormalities were found. CONCLUSIONS: High-grade spondylolisthesis is common in LDS and usually associated with spondylolysis. Patients requiring surgery for spondylolisthesis present during childhood and do well after instrumented PSF. Interbody fusion and stabilization of S1 and S2 can prevent physeal deformation.

Women with diseases like Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlo syndrome, or other aortic abnormalities, have an increased risk of complications during pregnancy.

Proper information should be provided about the risks of morbidity and mortality during pregnancy and information on the risks for the fetus, including the potential recurrence of disease in the offspring. Evaluation of past medical and family history, the aortic size before conception, and any increase in size before and during pregnancy, is essential to try and estimate the risk of aortic dissection. If the aorta is dilated, prophylactic repair before pregnancy may be indicated. In some cases, elective surgery during pregnancy may be warranted. In women with a severely dilated ascending aorta, caesarean section is, at present, the advised mode of delivery. ",

However, there is limited evidence about the perinatal management of LDS patients who have undergone prophylactic aortic root replacements (ARRs) before conception. CASE REPORT: We present the case of a 28-year-old nulliparous pregnant woman with LDS with a pathogenic variant within exon 5 of TGFBR2 (c.1379G > T, p.[Arg460Leu]), who underwent an ARR at 20 years of age. Cardiac echocardiography did not show any significant changes in the aorta during pregnancy, and her blood pressure remained normal. She had a cesarean section at 37 weeks of gestation. She developed an acute Stanford type B AD extending from the aortic arch to the infrarenal aorta 8 days postpartum and underwent a total arch replacement. CONCLUSION: This case report suggests that patients with LDS after prophylactic ARRs still possess a risk for Stanford type B ADs.",

On the basis of the patient's stated desire to conceive during preconception counseling, a multidisciplinary team was assembled. She conceived naturally after receiving prophylactic ARR and beta-blocker treatment. Multidisciplinary patient care included precise blood pressure management, continuation of beta-blocker treatment, cardiovascular assessment with echocardiogram, regional anesthesia during labor, prevention of lactation, and resumption of angiotensin II receptor blocker therapy immediately after delivery.

However, there is limited evidence about the perinatal management of LDS patients who have undergone prophylactic aortic root replacements (ARRs) before conception. CASE REPORT: We present the case of a 28-year-old nulliparous pregnant woman with LDS with a pathogenic variant within exon 5 of TGFBR2 (c.1379G > T, p.[Arg460Leu]), who underwent an ARR at 20 years of age. Cardiac echocardiography did not show any significant changes in the aorta during pregnancy, and her blood pressure remained normal. She had a cesarean section at 37 weeks of gestation. She developed an acute Stanford type B AD extending from the aortic arch to the infrarenal aorta 8 days postpartum and underwent a total arch replacement. CONCLUSION: This case report suggests that patients with LDS after prophylactic ARRs still possess a risk for Stanford type B ADs.",

The manifestations of LDS include vascular tortuosity, scoliosis, craniosynostosis, aneurysm and aortic dissections. Clinical presentation A 35-year-old woman treated with Stanford type B aortic dissection and breast cancer was referred to us for Borden type II dural arteriovenous fistula (dAVF) draining to the vein of Galen, involving the midline of tentorium cerebelli. The dAVF was treated successfully by combined transarterial and transvenous embolization. Because of tortuosity of vertebral arteries, a genetic test was conducted confirming LDS type 2. Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first case report of dAVF associated with LDS. The relationship between LDS and dAVF is unknown but this report shows the possibility that mutation of transforming growth factor beta receptors 2 ( TGFBR2) related to LDS may be related to shunt diseases. Because intervention in LDS seems to be feasible compared to Ehlers Danlos syndrome and Marfan syndrome, it is important to make the correct diagnosis.",

These modalities offer different advantages and limitations, which must be weighed according to the clinical context. This article provides an overview of current aortic root imaging, highlighting normal anatomy, pathologic conditions, imaging techniques, measurement thresholds, relevant surgical procedures, postoperative complications and potential imaging pitfalls. Patients with a range of clinical conditions are predisposed to aortic root disease, including Marfan syndrome, bicuspid aortic valve, vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and Loeys-Dietz syndrome. Various surgical techniques may be used to repair the aortic root, including placement of a composite valve graft, such as the Bentall and Cabrol procedures; placement of an aortic root graft with preservation of the native valve, such as the Yacoub and David techniques; and implantation of a biologic graft, such as a homograft, autograft, or xenograft. Potential imaging pitfalls in the postoperative period include mimickers of pathologic processes such as felt pledgets, graft folds, and nonabsorbable hemostatic agents. Postoperative complications that may be encountered include pseudoaneurysms, infection, and dehiscence. Radiologists should be familiar with normal aortic root anatomy, surgical procedures, and postoperative complications, to accurately interpret pre- and postoperative imaging performed for evaluation of the aortic root.

The results of prophylactic root replacement using valve-sparing procedures (valve-sparing root replacement [VSRR]) in patients with LDS is not known. METHODS: We reviewed all patients with clinical and genetic (transforming growth factor-beta receptor mutations) evidence of LDS who underwent VSRR at our institution. Echocardiographic and clinical data were obtained from hospital and follow-up clinic records. RESULTS: From 2002 to 2009, 31 patients with a firm diagnosis of LDS underwent VSRR for aortic root aneurysm. Mean age was 15 years, and 24 (77%) were children. One (3%) patient had a bicuspid aortic valve. Preoperative sinus diameter was 3.9+-0.8 cm (z score 7.0+-2.9) and 2 (6%) had greater than 2+ aortic insufficiency. Thirty patients (97%) underwent reimplantation procedures using a Valsalva graft. There were no operative deaths. Mean follow-up was 3.6 years (range, 0 to 7 years). One patient required late repair of a pseudoaneurysm at the distal aortic anastomosis, and 1 had a conversion to a David reimplantation procedure after a Florida sleeve operation. No patient suffered thromboembolism or endocarditis, and 1 (3%) patient experienced greater than 2+ late aortic insufficiency. No patient required late aortic valve repair or replacement. CONCLUSIONS: Loeys-Dietz syndrome is an aggressive aortic aneurysm syndrome that can be addressed by prophylactic aortic root replacement with low operative risk. Valve-sparing procedures have encouraging early and midterm results, similar to those in Marfan syndrome, and are an attractive option for young patients.",

Women with diseases like Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlo syndrome, or other aortic abnormalities, have an increased risk of complications during pregnancy. Counselling and risk assessment before pregnancy is mandatory for all women with known aortic disease. Proper information should be provided about the risks of morbidity and mortality during pregnancy and information on the risks for the fetus, including the potential recurrence of disease in the offspring. Evaluation of past medical and family history, the aortic size before conception, and any increase in size before and during pregnancy, is essential to try and estimate the risk of aortic dissection. If the aorta is dilated, prophylactic repair before pregnancy may be indicated. In some cases, elective surgery during pregnancy may be warranted. In women with a severely dilated ascending aorta, caesarean section is, at present, the advised mode of delivery. ",

The aim of this study was to explore the influence of oral manifestations on oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) in LDS patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: LDS subjects were assessed by the craniofacial team at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center Dental Clinic between June 2015 and January 2018. Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14) questionnaire, oral health self-care behavior questionnaire and a comprehensive dental examination were completed for each subject. OHRQoL was assessed using the OHIP-14 questionnaire with higher scores corresponding to worse OHRQoL. Regression models were used to determine the relationship between each oral manifestation and the OHIP-14 scores using a level of significance of p <= 0.05. RESULTS: A total of 33 LDS subjects (51.5% female) aged 3-57 years (19.6 +- 15.1 years) were included in the study. The OHIP-14 scores (n = 33) were significantly higher in LDS subjects (6.30 [SD 6.37]) when compared to unaffected family member subjects (1.50 [SD 2.28], p < 0.01), and higher than the previously reported scores of the general U.S. population (2.81 [SD 0.12]). Regarding oral health self-care behavior (n = 32), the majority of LDS subjects reported receiving regular dental care (81%) and maintaining good-to-excellent daily oral hygiene (75%). Using a crude regression model, worse OHRQoL was found to be associated with dental hypersensitivity (beta = 5.24; p < 0.05), temporomandibular joints (TMJ) abnormalities (beta = 5.92; p < 0.01), self-reported poor-to-fair oral health status (beta = 6.77; p < 0.01), and cumulation of four or more oral manifestations (beta = 7.23; p < 0.001). Finally, using a parsimonious model, self-reported poor-to-fair oral health status (beta = 5.87; p < 0.01) and TMJ abnormalities (beta = 4.95; p < 0.01) remained significant. CONCLUSIONS: The dental hypersensitivity, TMJ abnormalities, self-reported poor-to-fair oral health status and cumulation of four-or-more oral manifestations had significant influence on worse OHRQoL.

Areas covered: Present research suggests that there may be a link between treatment pattern, disease progression and economic costs of Marfan syndrome. It indicates that an early detection of the disease and preventive interventions achieve a dual aim. From a patient perspective, it may reduce the amount of emergency surgery or intervention, and inpatient stays. In addition, it slows disease progression, lowers lifestyle restrictions, reduces psychological stress, and improves health-related quality of life. Expert commentary: Early detection and preventive measures are likely to achieve a dual aim by simultaneously containing costs and reducing the number and length of inpatient stays.",

Women with diseases like Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlo syndrome, or other aortic abnormalities, have an increased risk of complications during pregnancy. Counselling and risk assessment before pregnancy is mandatory for all women with known aortic disease. Proper information should be provided about the risks of morbidity and mortality during pregnancy and information on the risks for the fetus, including the potential recurrence of disease in the offspring. Evaluation of past medical and family history, the aortic size before conception, and any increase in size before and during pregnancy, is essential to try and estimate the risk of aortic dissection. If the aorta is dilated, prophylactic repair before pregnancy may be indicated. In some cases, elective surgery during pregnancy may be warranted. In women with a severely dilated ascending aorta, caesarean section is, at present, the advised mode of delivery. ",

                    "abstract": "Heritable thoracic aortic diseases (HTAD) are rare pathologies associated with thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissection, which can be syndromic or non-syndromic. They may result from genetic defects. Associated genes identified to date are classified into those encoding components of the (a) extracellular matrix (b) TGFbeta pathway and (c) smooth muscle contractile mechanism. Timely diagnosis allows for prompt aortic surveillance and prophylactic surgery, hence improving life expectancy and reducing maternal complications as well as providing reassurance to family members when a diagnosis is ruled out. This document is an expert opinion reflecting strategies put forward by medical experts and patient representatives involved in the HTAD Rare Disease Working Group of VASCERN. It aims to provide a patient pathway that improves patient care by diminishing time to diagnosis, facilitating the establishment of a correct diagnosis using molecular genetics when possible, excluding the diagnosis in unaffected persons through appropriate family screening and avoiding overuse of resources. It is being recommended that patients are referred to an expert centre for further evaluation if they meet at least one of the following criteria: (1) thoracic aortic dissection (<70 years if hypertensive; all ages if non-hypertensive), (2) thoracic aortic aneurysm (all adults with Z score >3.5 or 2.5-3.5 if non-hypertensive or hypertensive and <60 years; all children with Z score >3), (3) family history of HTAD with/without a pathogenic variant in a gene linked to HTAD, (4) ectopia lentis without other obvious explanation and (5) a systemic score of >5 in adults and >3 in children. Aortic imaging primarily relies on transthoracic echocardiography with magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography as needed. Genetic testing should be considered in those with a high suspicion of underlying genetic aortopathy. Though panels vary among centers, for patients with thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection or systemic features these should include genes with a definitive or strong association to HTAD. Genetic cascade screening and serial aortic imaging should be considered for family screening and follow-up. In conclusion, the implementation of these strategies should help standardise the diagnostic work-up and follow-up of patients with suspected HTAD and the screening of their relatives.",

Follow-up control (4 weeks) documented patent debranching, and only minimal residual flow in the subclavian aneurysm. The described off-label use for sutureless cerebral revascularisation of the vertebral artery might be a fast, simple, and reliable solution for cervical debranching in selective challenging patients.

It is being recommended that patients are referred to an expert centre for further evaluation if they meet at least one of the following criteria: (1) thoracic aortic dissection (<70 years if hypertensive; all ages if non-hypertensive), (2) thoracic aortic aneurysm (all adults with Z score >3.5 or 2.5-3.5 if non-hypertensive or hypertensive and <60 years; all children with Z score >3), (3) family history of HTAD with/without a pathogenic variant in a gene linked to HTAD, (4) ectopia lentis without other obvious explanation and (5) a systemic score of >5 in adults and >3 in children. Aortic imaging primarily relies on transthoracic echocardiography with magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography as needed. Genetic testing should be considered in those with a high suspicion of underlying genetic aortopathy. Though panels vary among centers, for patients with thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection or systemic features these should include genes with a definitive or strong association to HTAD. Genetic cascade screening and serial aortic imaging should be considered for family screening and follow-up. In conclusion, the implementation of these strategies should help standardise the diagnostic work-up and follow-up of patients with suspected HTAD and the screening of their relatives.",

OBJECTIVES: We introduce the reader to the principles of genetic diagnostics and the medical and surgical prevention of thoracic aortic dissection in patients with genetic aortic syndromes. METHODS: A cardiologist, a health economist, a patient representative, a heart surgeon, and a molecular geneticist teamed up to elucidate their perspective on major aspects of genetics and prevention of genetic aortic syndromes. RESULTS: Genetic aortic syndromes reflect a broad spectrum of diverse disease entities comprising the Marfan syndrome, the Loeys-Dietz syndrome or the vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. The diagnosis of each respective disease entity requires combined assessment of phenotype and genotype information. A medical prevention of aortic complications such as dissection is mandatory although a curative therapy currently appears unlikely in humans. The single most important measure against acute aortic dissection is the preventive replacement of the aortic root, where valve preserving techniques appear preferable. Comprehensive prophylaxis including molecular diagnostics seem reasonable also from an economic point of view. DISCUSSION: Optimal prevention requires individualization of concepts, which entail a detailed diagnostic characterization of each specific genetic aortic syndrome including characterization of the genotype.",

The manifestations of LDS include vascular tortuosity, scoliosis, craniosynostosis, aneurysm and aortic dissections. Clinical presentation A 35-year-old woman treated with Stanford type B aortic dissection and breast cancer was referred to us for Borden type II dural arteriovenous fistula (dAVF) draining to the vein of Galen, involving the midline of tentorium cerebelli. The dAVF was treated successfully by combined transarterial and transvenous embolization. Because of tortuosity of vertebral arteries, a genetic test was conducted confirming LDS type 2. Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first case report of dAVF associated with LDS. The relationship between LDS and dAVF is unknown but this report shows the possibility that mutation of transforming growth factor beta receptors 2 ( TGFBR2) related to LDS may be related to shunt diseases. Because intervention in LDS seems to be feasible compared to Ehlers Danlos syndrome and Marfan syndrome, it is important to make the correct diagnosis.",

METHODS: The patient with a history of Loeys-Dietz syndrome who underwent repair of pectus excavatum with subsequent chronic chest wall pain underwent an uneventful SCS trial with percutaneous epidural placement of two temporary eight-electrode leads placed at the level of T3-T4-T5. RESULTS: After experiencing excellent pain relief over the next two days, the patient was implanted with permanent leads and rechargeable generator four weeks later and reported sustained pain relief at 12-month follow-up visit. CONCLUSION: SCS provides an effective, alternative treatment option for select patients with Loeys-Dietz syndrome who underwent repair of pectus excavatum with subsequent chronic chest wall pain who have failed conservative treatment.

LDS results in abnormal protein synthesis and dysfunctional connective tissue, which can result in unique cardiovascular anesthesia challenges related to perioperative management. Patients with LDS may manifest hypertelorism, bifid uvula or cleft palate, and arterial tortuosity. Virtually all LDS patients show some type of abnormal skin findings and bleeding tendency. These patients may show a rapid progression of aortic dilation, regurgitation, and a propensity towards rupture and/or dissection at a much earlier age and smaller aneurysm size. LDS patients who require surgical intervention require meticulous vigilance from the anesthesiologist. We describe a 26 year old patient with documented LDS type 1 who presented for repair of an ascending/root aneurysm in this case report. Recognition of LDS and intra-operative management of the cardiovascular manifestations of this disease is paramount in ensuring successful surgical outcome and to limit morbidity and mortality.",

The results of prophylactic root replacement using valve-sparing procedures (valve-sparing root replacement [VSRR]) in patients with LDS is not known. METHODS: We reviewed all patients with clinical and genetic (transforming growth factor-beta receptor mutations) evidence of LDS who underwent VSRR at our institution. Echocardiographic and clinical data were obtained from hospital and follow-up clinic records. RESULTS: From 2002 to 2009, 31 patients with a firm diagnosis of LDS underwent VSRR for aortic root aneurysm. Mean age was 15 years, and 24 (77%) were children. One (3%) patient had a bicuspid aortic valve. Preoperative sinus diameter was 3.9+-0.8 cm (z score 7.0+-2.9) and 2 (6%) had greater than 2+ aortic insufficiency. Thirty patients (97%) underwent reimplantation procedures using a Valsalva graft. There were no operative deaths. Mean follow-up was 3.6 years (range, 0 to 7 years). One patient required late repair of a pseudoaneurysm at the distal aortic anastomosis, and 1 had a conversion to a David reimplantation procedure after a Florida sleeve operation. No patient suffered thromboembolism or endocarditis, and 1 (3%) patient experienced greater than 2+ late aortic insufficiency. No patient required late aortic valve repair or replacement. CONCLUSIONS: Loeys-Dietz syndrome is an aggressive aortic aneurysm syndrome that can be addressed by prophylactic aortic root replacement with low operative risk. Valve-sparing procedures have encouraging early and midterm results, similar to those in Marfan syndrome, and are an attractive option for young patients.",

These modalities offer different advantages and limitations, which must be weighed according to the clinical context. This article provides an overview of current aortic root imaging, highlighting normal anatomy, pathologic conditions, imaging techniques, measurement thresholds, relevant surgical procedures, postoperative complications and potential imaging pitfalls. Patients with a range of clinical conditions are predisposed to aortic root disease, including Marfan syndrome, bicuspid aortic valve, vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and Loeys-Dietz syndrome. Various surgical techniques may be used to repair the aortic root, including placement of a composite valve graft, such as the Bentall and Cabrol procedures; placement of an aortic root graft with preservation of the native valve, such as the Yacoub and David techniques; and implantation of a biologic graft, such as a homograft, autograft, or xenograft. Potential imaging pitfalls in the postoperative period include mimickers of pathologic processes such as felt pledgets, graft folds, and nonabsorbable hemostatic agents. Postoperative complications that may be encountered include pseudoaneurysms, infection, and dehiscence. Radiologists should be familiar with normal aortic root anatomy, surgical procedures, and postoperative complications, to accurately interpret pre- and postoperative imaging performed for evaluation of the aortic root.

The aim of this study was to explore the influence of oral manifestations on oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) in LDS patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: LDS subjects were assessed by the craniofacial team at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center Dental Clinic between June 2015 and January 2018. Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14) questionnaire, oral health self-care behavior questionnaire and a comprehensive dental examination were completed for each subject. OHRQoL was assessed using the OHIP-14 questionnaire with higher scores corresponding to worse OHRQoL. Regression models were used to determine the relationship between each oral manifestation and the OHIP-14 scores using a level of significance of p <= 0.05. RESULTS: A total of 33 LDS subjects (51.5% female) aged 3-57 years (19.6 +- 15.1 years) were included in the study. The OHIP-14 scores (n = 33) were significantly higher in LDS subjects (6.30 [SD 6.37]) when compared to unaffected family member subjects (1.50 [SD 2.28], p < 0.01), and higher than the previously reported scores of the general U.S. population (2.81 [SD 0.12]). Regarding oral health self-care behavior (n = 32), the majority of LDS subjects reported receiving regular dental care (81%) and maintaining good-to-excellent daily oral hygiene (75%). Using a crude regression model, worse OHRQoL was found to be associated with dental hypersensitivity (beta = 5.24; p < 0.05), temporomandibular joints (TMJ) abnormalities (beta = 5.92; p < 0.01), self-reported poor-to-fair oral health status (beta = 6.77; p < 0.01), and cumulation of four or more oral manifestations (beta = 7.23; p < 0.001). Finally, using a parsimonious model, self-reported poor-to-fair oral health status (beta = 5.87; p < 0.01) and TMJ abnormalities (beta = 4.95; p < 0.01) remained significant. CONCLUSIONS: The dental hypersensitivity, TMJ abnormalities, self-reported poor-to-fair oral health status and cumulation of four-or-more oral manifestations had significant influence on worse OHRQoL. Specific dental treatment guidelines are necessary to ensure optimal quality of life in patients diagnosed with LDS.",

LDS results in abnormal protein synthesis and dysfunctional connective tissue, which can result in unique cardiovascular anesthesia challenges related to perioperative management. Patients with LDS may manifest hypertelorism, bifid uvula or cleft palate, and arterial tortuosity. Virtually all LDS patients show some type of abnormal skin findings and bleeding tendency. These patients may show a rapid progression of aortic dilation, regurgitation, and a propensity towards rupture and/or dissection at a much earlier age and smaller aneurysm size. LDS patients who require surgical intervention require meticulous vigilance from the anesthesiologist. We describe a 26 year old patient with documented LDS type 1 who presented for repair of an ascending/root aneurysm in this case report. Recognition of LDS and intra-operative management of the cardiovascular manifestations of this disease is paramount in ensuring successful surgical outcome and to limit morbidity and mortality.",

OBJECTIVES: To describe the indications, operative course, and outcomes in eight pediatric patients who underwent occiput-to-pelvis (O-P) spinal arthrodesis. SUMMARY: Spinal arthrodesis from the occiput to pelvis is needed for some children with extensive spine deformity. There are few reports of patients with O-P arthrodesis. METHODS: We reviewed records of pediatric patients who underwent spinal arthrodesis to treat spine deformity between 1987 and 2017 at one institution. Eight patients (six girls) who underwent staged O-P arthrodesis were identified. Underlying conditions, indications for surgery, medical comorbidities, operative courses, complications, and imaging of these patients were recorded. RESULTS: Diagnoses were neuromuscular disorders in five patients and syndromic disorders in three patients. Mean ages were 9.7 +- 4.1 years at index surgery and 16.8 +- 4.6 years at completion of O-P arthrodesis. Patients underwent a mean of three operations (range, two to five). Occipitocervical arthrodesis was the final operation in six of eight patients (all but the two patients with Loeys-Dietz syndrome). Mean follow-up after the last procedure was 8.5 +- 7.1 years. Two patients underwent revision for protruding occipital implants, and one patient underwent revision for thoracic pseudarthrosis. No patients developed postoperative infections or new neurologic deficits. At final follow-up, Scoliosis Research Society-22r questionnaire scores were lowest for Function (2.6 +- 1.0 of 5 possible points) and highest for Satisfaction (4.1 +- 1.4). CONCLUSIONS: O-P arthrodesis can benefit patients with extensive spine deformity from neuromuscular or syndromic causes. Patients were young at first operation, which may suggest that younger patients are at higher risk than older patients of major progression of deformity in other spinal regions after deformity correction. Health-related quality of life and radiographic outcomes suggest that patients who underwent O-P arthrodesis had satisfactory outcomes and maintenance of correction during a mean of 8.5 years of follow-up. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, therapeutic study.",

METHODS: The patient with a history of Loeys-Dietz syndrome who underwent repair of pectus excavatum with subsequent chronic chest wall pain underwent an uneventful SCS trial with percutaneous epidural placement of two temporary eight-electrode leads placed at the level of T3-T4-T5. RESULTS: After experiencing excellent pain relief over the next two days, the patient was implanted with permanent leads and rechargeable generator four weeks later and reported sustained pain relief at 12-month follow-up visit. CONCLUSION: SCS provides an effective, alternative treatment option for select patients with Loeys-Dietz syndrome who underwent repair of pectus excavatum with subsequent chronic chest wall pain who have failed conservative treatment. SCS may provide pain relief with advantages over conservative treatments and more invasive techniques.",

The described off-label use for sutureless cerebral revascularisation of the vertebral artery might be a fast, simple, and reliable solution for cervical debranching in selective challenging patients. Further studies are necessary to evaluate side effects and durability.",

METHODS: Clinical data and lumbosacral imaging of 138 patients with LDS were reviewed. Spondylolisthesis (L4-L5 or L5-S1) and spondylolysis were characterized by multimodal imaging and correlated with clinical data. Treatments and outcomes were characterized for patients with spondylolisthesis. Associations were determined using the Fisher exact, Mann-Whitney, and Student t tests (alpha=0.05). RESULTS: Twenty-four patients (17%) had spondylolysis and 23 (17%) had spondylolisthesis. Median age at spondylolisthesis diagnosis was 11 (interquartile range, 9.5) years. In patients in whom measurement was possible (n=20), mean (+-SD) slip was 48% (+-35%). Nineteen patients had L5-S1 slip and 4 had L4-L5 slip. Of the patients with spondylolisthesis, 5 had no evidence of spondylolysis; of those with spondylolysis, all but 6 had spondylolisthesis. Eleven patients with spondylolisthesis underwent posterior spinal fusion (PSF) to treat slip progression, pain, and/or neurological deficit. Spondylolisthesis recurred in 1 patient who underwent PSF with bone graft arthrodesis alone (no instrumentation). The other 10 patients underwent PSF with instrumentation and fusion. Three patients additionally underwent Bohlman interbody fusion. Two patients developed implant failure. S2 fixation was performed at revision to achieve fusion in these patients. Mean Meyerding grade improved in patients who underwent arthrodesis, from 3.9 (+-1.2) to 1.9 (+-1.3) (P=0.002). Complications were 2 cerebrospinal fluid leaks, 2 transient postoperative paresthesias, and 1 case each of pseudarthrosis at S1-S2, wound dehiscence, and transient urinary incontinence. No significant associations between LDS type and lumbosacral abnormalities were found. CONCLUSIONS: High-grade spondylolisthesis is common in LDS and usually associated with spondylolysis. Patients requiring surgery for spondylolisthesis present during childhood and do well after instrumented PSF. Interbody fusion and stabilization of S1 and S2 can prevent physeal deformation. LDS should be considered in patients with high-grade spondylolisthesis. Patients with LDS should be monitored for spondylolisthesis and spondylolysis starting when they are young.

After treating two previously reported cases of postpartum AD in women with LDS following prophylactic aortic root replacement (ARR), we succeeded in managing a 30-year-old primigravida with no AD during her peripartum period. On the basis of the patient's stated desire to conceive during preconception counseling, a multidisciplinary team was assembled. She conceived naturally after receiving prophylactic ARR and beta-blocker treatment. Multidisciplinary patient care included precise blood pressure management, continuation of beta-blocker treatment, cardiovascular assessment with echocardiogram, regional anesthesia during labor, prevention of lactation, and resumption of angiotensin II receptor blocker therapy immediately after delivery. On the basis of our assessment of three cases, including this case, and a literature review, we propose a peripartum management strategy for patients with LDS following prophylactic ARR.",

OBJECTIVES: We introduce the reader to the principles of genetic diagnostics and the medical and surgical prevention of thoracic aortic dissection in patients with genetic aortic syndromes. METHODS: A cardiologist, a health economist, a patient representative, a heart surgeon, and a molecular geneticist teamed up to elucidate their perspective on major aspects of genetics and prevention of genetic aortic syndromes. RESULTS: Genetic aortic syndromes reflect a broad spectrum of diverse disease entities comprising the Marfan syndrome, the Loeys-Dietz syndrome or the vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. The diagnosis of each respective disease entity requires combined assessment of phenotype and genotype information. A medical prevention of aortic complications such as dissection is mandatory although a curative therapy currently appears unlikely in humans. The single most important measure against acute aortic dissection is the preventive replacement of the aortic root, where valve preserving techniques appear preferable. Comprehensive prophylaxis including molecular diagnostics seem reasonable also from an economic point of view. DISCUSSION: Optimal prevention requires individualization of concepts, which entail a detailed diagnostic characterization of each specific genetic aortic syndrome including characterization of the genotype.",

On the basis of the patient's stated desire to conceive during preconception counseling, a multidisciplinary team was assembled. She conceived naturally after receiving prophylactic ARR and beta-blocker treatment. Multidisciplinary patient care included precise blood pressure management, continuation of beta-blocker treatment, cardiovascular assessment with echocardiogram, regional anesthesia during labor, prevention of lactation, and resumption of angiotensin II receptor blocker therapy immediately after delivery.

However, there is limited evidence about the perinatal management of LDS patients who have undergone prophylactic aortic root replacements (ARRs) before conception. CASE REPORT: We present the case of a 28-year-old nulliparous pregnant woman with LDS with a pathogenic variant within exon 5 of TGFBR2 (c.1379G > T, p.[Arg460Leu]), who underwent an ARR at 20 years of age. Cardiac echocardiography did not show any significant changes in the aorta during pregnancy, and her blood pressure remained normal. She had a cesarean section at 37 weeks of gestation. She developed an acute Stanford type B AD extending from the aortic arch to the infrarenal aorta 8 days postpartum and underwent a total arch replacement. CONCLUSION: This case report suggests that patients with LDS after prophylactic ARRs still possess a risk for Stanford type B ADs.",

Proper information should be provided about the risks of morbidity and mortality during pregnancy and information on the risks for the fetus, including the potential recurrence of disease in the offspring. Evaluation of past medical and family history, the aortic size before conception, and any increase in size before and during pregnancy, is essential to try and estimate the risk of aortic dissection. If the aorta is dilated, prophylactic repair before pregnancy may be indicated. In some cases, elective surgery during pregnancy may be warranted. In women with a severely dilated ascending aorta, caesarean section is, at present, the advised mode of delivery. ",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) is a rare connective tissue disorder whose oral manifestations and dental phenotypes have not been well-characterized. The aim of this study was to explore the influence of oral manifestations on oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) in LDS patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: LDS subjects were assessed by the craniofacial team at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center Dental Clinic between June 2015 and January 2018. Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14) questionnaire, oral health self-care behavior questionnaire and a comprehensive dental examination were completed for each subject. OHRQoL was assessed using the OHIP-14 questionnaire with higher scores corresponding to worse OHRQoL. Regression models were used to determine the relationship between each oral manifestation and the OHIP-14 scores using a level of significance of p <= 0.05. RESULTS: A total of 33 LDS subjects (51.5% female) aged 3-57 years (19.6 +- 15.1 years) were included in the study. The OHIP-14 scores (n = 33) were significantly higher in LDS subjects (6.30 [SD 6.37]) when compared to unaffected family member subjects (1.50 [SD 2.28], p < 0.01), and higher than the previously reported scores of the general U.S. population (2.81 [SD 0.12]). Regarding oral health self-care behavior (n = 32), the majority of LDS subjects reported receiving regular dental care (81%) and maintaining good-to-excellent daily oral hygiene (75%). Using a crude regression model, worse OHRQoL was found to be associated with dental hypersensitivity (beta = 5.24; p < 0.05), temporomandibular joints (TMJ) abnormalities (beta = 5.92; p < 0.01), self-reported poor-to-fair oral health status (beta = 6.77; p < 0.01), and cumulation of four or more oral manifestations (beta = 7.23; p < 0.001). Finally, using a parsimonious model, self-reported poor-to-fair oral health status (beta = 5.87; p < 0.01) and TMJ abnormalities (beta = 4.95; p < 0.01) remained significant. CONCLUSIONS: The dental hypersensitivity, TMJ abnormalities, self-reported poor-to-fair oral health status and cumulation of four-or-more oral manifestations had significant influence on worse OHRQoL. Specific dental treatment guidelines are necessary to ensure optimal quality of life in patients diagnosed with LDS.",

The results of prophylactic root replacement using valve-sparing procedures (valve-sparing root replacement [VSRR]) in patients with LDS is not known. METHODS: We reviewed all patients with clinical and genetic (transforming growth factor-beta receptor mutations) evidence of LDS who underwent VSRR at our institution. Echocardiographic and clinical data were obtained from hospital and follow-up clinic records. RESULTS: From 2002 to 2009, 31 patients with a firm diagnosis of LDS underwent VSRR for aortic root aneurysm. Mean age was 15 years, and 24 (77%) were children. One (3%) patient had a bicuspid aortic valve. Preoperative sinus diameter was 3.9+-0.8 cm (z score 7.0+-2.9) and 2 (6%) had greater than 2+ aortic insufficiency. Thirty patients (97%) underwent reimplantation procedures using a Valsalva graft. There were no operative deaths. Mean follow-up was 3.6 years (range, 0 to 7 years). One patient required late repair of a pseudoaneurysm at the distal aortic anastomosis, and 1 had a conversion to a David reimplantation procedure after a Florida sleeve operation. No patient suffered thromboembolism or endocarditis, and 1 (3%) patient experienced greater than 2+ late aortic insufficiency. No patient required late aortic valve repair or replacement. CONCLUSIONS: Loeys-Dietz syndrome is an aggressive aortic aneurysm syndrome that can be addressed by prophylactic aortic root replacement with low operative risk. Valve-sparing procedures have encouraging early and midterm results, similar to those in Marfan syndrome, and are an attractive option for young patients.",

LDS results in abnormal protein synthesis and dysfunctional connective tissue, which can result in unique cardiovascular anesthesia challenges related to perioperative management. Patients with LDS may manifest hypertelorism, bifid uvula or cleft palate, and arterial tortuosity. Virtually all LDS patients show some type of abnormal skin findings and bleeding tendency. These patients may show a rapid progression of aortic dilation, regurgitation, and a propensity towards rupture and/or dissection at a much earlier age and smaller aneurysm size. LDS patients who require surgical intervention require meticulous vigilance from the anesthesiologist. We describe a 26 year old patient with documented LDS type 1 who presented for repair of an ascending/root aneurysm in this case report.

OBJECTIVES: To describe the indications, operative course, and outcomes in eight pediatric patients who underwent occiput-to-pelvis (O-P) spinal arthrodesis. SUMMARY: Spinal arthrodesis from the occiput to pelvis is needed for some children with extensive spine deformity. There are few reports of patients with O-P arthrodesis. METHODS: We reviewed records of pediatric patients who underwent spinal arthrodesis to treat spine deformity between 1987 and 2017 at one institution. Eight patients (six girls) who underwent staged O-P arthrodesis were identified. Underlying conditions, indications for surgery, medical comorbidities, operative courses, complications, and imaging of these patients were recorded. RESULTS: Diagnoses were neuromuscular disorders in five patients and syndromic disorders in three patients. Mean ages were 9.7 +- 4.1 years at index surgery and 16.8 +- 4.6 years at completion of O-P arthrodesis. Patients underwent a mean of three operations (range, two to five). Occipitocervical arthrodesis was the final operation in six of eight patients (all but the two patients with Loeys-Dietz syndrome). Mean follow-up after the last procedure was 8.5 +- 7.1 years. Two patients underwent revision for protruding occipital implants, and one patient underwent revision for thoracic pseudarthrosis. No patients developed postoperative infections or new neurologic deficits. At final follow-up, Scoliosis Research Society-22r questionnaire scores were lowest for Function (2.6 +- 1.0 of 5 possible points) and highest for Satisfaction (4.1 +- 1.4). CONCLUSIONS: O-P arthrodesis can benefit patients with extensive spine deformity from neuromuscular or syndromic causes. Patients were young at first operation, which may suggest that younger patients are at higher risk than older patients of major progression of deformity in other spinal regions after deformity correction. Health-related quality of life and radiographic outcomes suggest that patients who underwent O-P arthrodesis had satisfactory outcomes and maintenance of correction during a mean of 8.5 years of follow-up.

METHODS: Clinical data and lumbosacral imaging of 138 patients with LDS were reviewed. Spondylolisthesis (L4-L5 or L5-S1) and spondylolysis were characterized by multimodal imaging and correlated with clinical data. Treatments and outcomes were characterized for patients with spondylolisthesis. Associations were determined using the Fisher exact, Mann-Whitney, and Student t tests (alpha=0.05). RESULTS: Twenty-four patients (17%) had spondylolysis and 23 (17%) had spondylolisthesis. Median age at spondylolisthesis diagnosis was 11 (interquartile range, 9.5) years. In patients in whom measurement was possible (n=20), mean (+-SD) slip was 48% (+-35%). Nineteen patients had L5-S1 slip and 4 had L4-L5 slip. Of the patients with spondylolisthesis, 5 had no evidence of spondylolysis; of those with spondylolysis, all but 6 had spondylolisthesis. Eleven patients with spondylolisthesis underwent posterior spinal fusion (PSF) to treat slip progression, pain, and/or neurological deficit. Spondylolisthesis recurred in 1 patient who underwent PSF with bone graft arthrodesis alone (no instrumentation). The other 10 patients underwent PSF with instrumentation and fusion. Three patients additionally underwent Bohlman interbody fusion. Two patients developed implant failure. S2 fixation was performed at revision to achieve fusion in these patients. Mean Meyerding grade improved in patients who underwent arthrodesis, from 3.9 (+-1.2) to 1.9 (+-1.3) (P=0.002). Complications were 2 cerebrospinal fluid leaks, 2 transient postoperative paresthesias, and 1 case each of pseudarthrosis at S1-S2, wound dehiscence, and transient urinary incontinence. No significant associations between LDS type and lumbosacral abnormalities were found. CONCLUSIONS: High-grade spondylolisthesis is common in LDS and usually associated with spondylolysis. Patients requiring surgery for spondylolisthesis present during childhood and do well after instrumented PSF. Interbody fusion and stabilization of S1 and S2 can prevent physeal deformation. LDS should be considered in patients with high-grade spondylolisthesis. Patients with LDS should be monitored for spondylolisthesis and spondylolysis starting when they are young.

                    "abstract": "Heritable thoracic aortic diseases (HTAD) are rare pathologies associated with thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissection, which can be syndromic or non-syndromic. They may result from genetic defects. Associated genes identified to date are classified into those encoding components of the (a) extracellular matrix (b) TGFbeta pathway and (c) smooth muscle contractile mechanism. Timely diagnosis allows for prompt aortic surveillance and prophylactic surgery, hence improving life expectancy and reducing maternal complications as well as providing reassurance to family members when a diagnosis is ruled out. This document is an expert opinion reflecting strategies put forward by medical experts and patient representatives involved in the HTAD Rare Disease Working Group of VASCERN. It aims to provide a patient pathway that improves patient care by diminishing time to diagnosis, facilitating the establishment of a correct diagnosis using molecular genetics when possible, excluding the diagnosis in unaffected persons through appropriate family screening and avoiding overuse of resources. It is being recommended that patients are referred to an expert centre for further evaluation if they meet at least one of the following criteria: (1) thoracic aortic dissection (<70 years if hypertensive; all ages if non-hypertensive), (2) thoracic aortic aneurysm (all adults with Z score >3.5 or 2.5-3.5 if non-hypertensive or hypertensive and <60 years; all children with Z score >3), (3) family history of HTAD with/without a pathogenic variant in a gene linked to HTAD, (4) ectopia lentis without other obvious explanation and (5) a systemic score of >5 in adults and >3 in children. Aortic imaging primarily relies on transthoracic echocardiography with magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography as needed. Genetic testing should be considered in those with a high suspicion of underlying genetic aortopathy.

One aneurysm was a true aneurysm in the subaortic region and the second one was a pseudoaneurysm at the left ventricular apex. The patient was a high-risk candidate for repeated operations. Both aneurysms were closed successfully percutaneously in staged procedures. There were no complications. The patient remained clinically well with stable echocardiographic results upon reassessment. This case illustrated that catheter-based closure of left ventricular aneurysms is a feasible approach in the context of connective tissue abnormalities related to the Loeys-Dietz syndrome.",

Follow-up control (4 weeks) documented patent debranching, and only minimal residual flow in the subclavian aneurysm. The described off-label use for sutureless cerebral revascularisation of the vertebral artery might be a fast, simple, and reliable solution for cervical debranching in selective challenging patients.

However, there is limited evidence about the perinatal management of LDS patients who have undergone prophylactic aortic root replacements (ARRs) before conception. CASE REPORT: We present the case of a 28-year-old nulliparous pregnant woman with LDS with a pathogenic variant within exon 5 of TGFBR2 (c.1379G > T, p.[Arg460Leu]), who underwent an ARR at 20 years of age. Cardiac echocardiography did not show any significant changes in the aorta during pregnancy, and her blood pressure remained normal. She had a cesarean section at 37 weeks of gestation. She developed an acute Stanford type B AD extending from the aortic arch to the infrarenal aorta 8 days postpartum and underwent a total arch replacement. CONCLUSION: This case report suggests that patients with LDS after prophylactic ARRs still possess a risk for Stanford type B ADs.",

OBJECTIVES: We introduce the reader to the principles of genetic diagnostics and the medical and surgical prevention of thoracic aortic dissection in patients with genetic aortic syndromes. METHODS: A cardiologist, a health economist, a patient representative, a heart surgeon, and a molecular geneticist teamed up to elucidate their perspective on major aspects of genetics and prevention of genetic aortic syndromes. RESULTS: Genetic aortic syndromes reflect a broad spectrum of diverse disease entities comprising the Marfan syndrome, the Loeys-Dietz syndrome or the vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. The diagnosis of each respective disease entity requires combined assessment of phenotype and genotype information. A medical prevention of aortic complications such as dissection is mandatory although a curative therapy currently appears unlikely in humans. The single most important measure against acute aortic dissection is the preventive replacement of the aortic root, where valve preserving techniques appear preferable. Comprehensive prophylaxis including molecular diagnostics seem reasonable also from an economic point of view. DISCUSSION: Optimal prevention requires individualization of concepts, which entail a detailed diagnostic characterization of each specific genetic aortic syndrome including characterization of the genotype.",

The results of prophylactic root replacement using valve-sparing procedures (valve-sparing root replacement [VSRR]) in patients with LDS is not known. METHODS: We reviewed all patients with clinical and genetic (transforming growth factor-beta receptor mutations) evidence of LDS who underwent VSRR at our institution. Echocardiographic and clinical data were obtained from hospital and follow-up clinic records. RESULTS: From 2002 to 2009, 31 patients with a firm diagnosis of LDS underwent VSRR for aortic root aneurysm. Mean age was 15 years, and 24 (77%) were children. One (3%) patient had a bicuspid aortic valve. Preoperative sinus diameter was 3.9+-0.8 cm (z score 7.0+-2.9) and 2 (6%) had greater than 2+ aortic insufficiency. Thirty patients (97%) underwent reimplantation procedures using a Valsalva graft. There were no operative deaths. Mean follow-up was 3.6 years (range, 0 to 7 years). One patient required late repair of a pseudoaneurysm at the distal aortic anastomosis, and 1 had a conversion to a David reimplantation procedure after a Florida sleeve operation. No patient suffered thromboembolism or endocarditis, and 1 (3%) patient experienced greater than 2+ late aortic insufficiency. No patient required late aortic valve repair or replacement. CONCLUSIONS: Loeys-Dietz syndrome is an aggressive aortic aneurysm syndrome that can be addressed by prophylactic aortic root replacement with low operative risk. Valve-sparing procedures have encouraging early and midterm results, similar to those in Marfan syndrome, and are an attractive option for young patients.",

Follow-up control (4 weeks) documented patent debranching, and only minimal residual flow in the subclavian aneurysm. The described off-label use for sutureless cerebral revascularisation of the vertebral artery might be a fast, simple, and reliable solution for cervical debranching in selective challenging patients.

Patients with LDS may manifest hypertelorism, bifid uvula or cleft palate, and arterial tortuosity. Virtually all LDS patients show some type of abnormal skin findings and bleeding tendency. These patients may show a rapid progression of aortic dilation, regurgitation, and a propensity towards rupture and/or dissection at a much earlier age and smaller aneurysm size. LDS patients who require surgical intervention require meticulous vigilance from the anesthesiologist. We describe a 26 year old patient with documented LDS type 1 who presented for repair of an ascending/root aneurysm in this case report.

Physical (62%, 39/62), occupational (41%, 23/56), and speech therapies (34%, 20/58) were common. Feeding issues were common (41%, 23/56). TGFBR1 mutations were more frequent among those with motor delays and feeding issues. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with LDS and/or their caregivers report at least one ND problem in most cases, and many require therapies. These data suggest ND disorders should be considered to be part of the phenotype.",

Poor wound healing has also been observed in in some patients with CTD, potentially increasing the risk of surgical interventions. We undertook to determine the safety and efficacy of gastrostomy tube placement in this population. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 10 LDS patients who had a total of 12 gastrostomy tubes placed. RESULTS: No procedural complications occurred, although one patient developed buried bumper syndrome in the near post-procedural time period and one patient had a small abscess at a surgical stitch. Most patients exhibited improvements in growth, with a median immediate improvement in BMI Z-score of 0.2 per month following the institution of gastrostomy tube feedings. Those with uncontrolled inflammation due to inflammatory bowel disease or eosinophilic gastrointestinal disease showed the least benefit and in some cases failed to demonstrate significant weight gain despite nutritional supplementation. CONCLUSIONS: Gastrostomy tube placement (surgical or endoscopic) is a generally safe and a reasonable therapeutic option for patients with LDS despite their underlying CTD.",

                    "abstract": "Heritable thoracic aortic diseases (HTAD) are rare pathologies associated with thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissection, which can be syndromic or non-syndromic. They may result from genetic defects. Associated genes identified to date are classified into those encoding components of the (a) extracellular matrix (b) TGFbeta pathway and (c) smooth muscle contractile mechanism. Timely diagnosis allows for prompt aortic surveillance and prophylactic surgery, hence improving life expectancy and reducing maternal complications as well as providing reassurance to family members when a diagnosis is ruled out. This document is an expert opinion reflecting strategies put forward by medical experts and patient representatives involved in the HTAD Rare Disease Working Group of VASCERN. It aims to provide a patient pathway that improves patient care by diminishing time to diagnosis, facilitating the establishment of a correct diagnosis using molecular genetics when possible, excluding the diagnosis in unaffected persons through appropriate family screening and avoiding overuse of resources. It is being recommended that patients are referred to an expert centre for further evaluation if they meet at least one of the following criteria: (1) thoracic aortic dissection (<70 years if hypertensive; all ages if non-hypertensive), (2) thoracic aortic aneurysm (all adults with Z score >3.5 or 2.5-3.5 if non-hypertensive or hypertensive and <60 years; all children with Z score >3), (3) family history of HTAD with/without a pathogenic variant in a gene linked to HTAD, (4) ectopia lentis without other obvious explanation and (5) a systemic score of >5 in adults and >3 in children. Aortic imaging primarily relies on transthoracic echocardiography with magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography as needed. Genetic testing should be considered in those with a high suspicion of underlying genetic aortopathy. Though panels vary among centers, for patients with thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection or systemic features these should include genes with a definitive or strong association to HTAD. Genetic cascade screening and serial aortic imaging should be considered for family screening and follow-up. In conclusion, the implementation of these strategies should help standardise the diagnostic work-up and follow-up of patients with suspected HTAD and the screening of their relatives.",

These modalities offer different advantages and limitations, which must be weighed according to the clinical context. This article provides an overview of current aortic root imaging, highlighting normal anatomy, pathologic conditions, imaging techniques, measurement thresholds, relevant surgical procedures, postoperative complications and potential imaging pitfalls. Patients with a range of clinical conditions are predisposed to aortic root disease, including Marfan syndrome, bicuspid aortic valve, vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and Loeys-Dietz syndrome. Various surgical techniques may be used to repair the aortic root, including placement of a composite valve graft, such as the Bentall and Cabrol procedures; placement of an aortic root graft with preservation of the native valve, such as the Yacoub and David techniques; and implantation of a biologic graft, such as a homograft, autograft, or xenograft. Potential imaging pitfalls in the postoperative period include mimickers of pathologic processes such as felt pledgets, graft folds, and nonabsorbable hemostatic agents. Postoperative complications that may be encountered include pseudoaneurysms, infection, and dehiscence. Radiologists should be familiar with normal aortic root anatomy, surgical procedures, and postoperative complications, to accurately interpret pre- and postoperative imaging performed for evaluation of the aortic root.

METHODS: The patient with a history of Loeys-Dietz syndrome who underwent repair of pectus excavatum with subsequent chronic chest wall pain underwent an uneventful SCS trial with percutaneous epidural placement of two temporary eight-electrode leads placed at the level of T3-T4-T5. RESULTS: After experiencing excellent pain relief over the next two days, the patient was implanted with permanent leads and rechargeable generator four weeks later and reported sustained pain relief at 12-month follow-up visit. CONCLUSION: SCS provides an effective, alternative treatment option for select patients with Loeys-Dietz syndrome who underwent repair of pectus excavatum with subsequent chronic chest wall pain who have failed conservative treatment. SCS may provide pain relief with advantages over conservative treatments and more invasive techniques.",

After treating two previously reported cases of postpartum AD in women with LDS following prophylactic aortic root replacement (ARR), we succeeded in managing a 30-year-old primigravida with no AD during her peripartum period. On the basis of the patient's stated desire to conceive during preconception counseling, a multidisciplinary team was assembled. She conceived naturally after receiving prophylactic ARR and beta-blocker treatment. Multidisciplinary patient care included precise blood pressure management, continuation of beta-blocker treatment, cardiovascular assessment with echocardiogram, regional anesthesia during labor, prevention of lactation, and resumption of angiotensin II receptor blocker therapy immediately after delivery. On the basis of our assessment of three cases, including this case, and a literature review, we propose a peripartum management strategy for patients with LDS following prophylactic ARR.",
