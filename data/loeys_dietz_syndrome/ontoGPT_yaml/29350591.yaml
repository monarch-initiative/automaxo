input_text: "Clip ligation for ruptured intracranial aneurysm in a child with Loeys-Dietz
  syndrome: case report. The authors present the case of a pediatric patient with
  Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) who underwent craniotomy for clip ligation of a ruptured
  intracranial aneurysm. To the authors' knowledge, this is the youngest reported
  patient with LDS who has been treated for a ruptured intracranial aneurysm. The
  patient presented with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage even though the results
  of surveillance screening were negative, and the aneurysm arose from the wall of
  the parent artery away from an arterial branch point. She was treated with open
  clip ligation and recovered well. The authors review the other reported cases of
  treated intracranial aneurysms in patients with LDS."
