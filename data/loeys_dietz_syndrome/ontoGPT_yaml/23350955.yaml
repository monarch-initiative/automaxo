input_text: 'Imaging and percutaneous occlusion of a large aneurysm of the ductus
  arteriosus in an infant with Loeys-Dietz syndrome. Loeys-Dietz is a multisystem
  congenital syndrome that comprises craniofacial and cutaneous abnormalities as well
  as structural cardiac defects. One of its key pathological features is an aggressive
  widespread vasculopathy that can manifest as aortic or cerebral aneurysms, which
  is prone to dissection and rupture. We report a case of a large aneurysm of the
  ductus arteriosus in a patient with Loeys-Dietz syndrome, successfully occluded
  by interventional catheterization. '
