input_text: 'Spondylolisthesis is Common, Early, and Severe in Loeys-Dietz Syndrome.
  BACKGROUND: We studied the prevalence and treatment outcomes of spondylolisthesis
  in patients with Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS). METHODS: Clinical data and lumbosacral
  imaging of 138 patients with LDS were reviewed. Spondylolisthesis (L4-L5 or L5-S1)
  and spondylolysis were characterized by multimodal imaging and correlated with clinical
  data. Treatments and outcomes were characterized for patients with spondylolisthesis.
  Associations were determined using the Fisher exact, Mann-Whitney, and Student t
  tests (alpha=0.05). RESULTS: Twenty-four patients (17%) had spondylolysis and 23
  (17%) had spondylolisthesis. Median age at spondylolisthesis diagnosis was 11 (interquartile
  range, 9.5) years. In patients in whom measurement was possible (n=20), mean (+-SD)
  slip was 48% (+-35%). Nineteen patients had L5-S1 slip and 4 had L4-L5 slip. Of
  the patients with spondylolisthesis, 5 had no evidence of spondylolysis; of those
  with spondylolysis, all but 6 had spondylolisthesis. Eleven patients with spondylolisthesis
  underwent posterior spinal fusion (PSF) to treat slip progression, pain, and/or
  neurological deficit. Spondylolisthesis recurred in 1 patient who underwent PSF
  with bone graft arthrodesis alone (no instrumentation). The other 10 patients underwent
  PSF with instrumentation and fusion. Three patients additionally underwent Bohlman
  interbody fusion. Two patients developed implant failure. S2 fixation was performed
  at revision to achieve fusion in these patients. Mean Meyerding grade improved in
  patients who underwent arthrodesis, from 3.9 (+-1.2) to 1.9 (+-1.3) (P=0.002). Complications
  were 2 cerebrospinal fluid leaks, 2 transient postoperative paresthesias, and 1
  case each of pseudarthrosis at S1-S2, wound dehiscence, and transient urinary incontinence.
  No significant associations between LDS type and lumbosacral abnormalities were
  found. CONCLUSIONS: High-grade spondylolisthesis is common in LDS and usually associated
  with spondylolysis. Patients requiring surgery for spondylolisthesis present during
  childhood and do well after instrumented PSF. Interbody fusion and stabilization
  of S1 and S2 can prevent physeal deformation. LDS should be considered in patients
  with high-grade spondylolisthesis. Patients with LDS should be monitored for spondylolisthesis
  and spondylolysis starting when they are young. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV-retrospective
  study.'
