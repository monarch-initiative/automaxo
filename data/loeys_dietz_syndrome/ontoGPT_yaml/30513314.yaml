input_text: Successful Heart Transplantation in a Patient With Loeys-Dietz Syndrome.
  Our patient is a 45-year-old woman with a history of Loeys-Dietz syndrome, vertebral
  artery dissection, stroke, prior atrial septal defect repair, and spontaneous left
  main coronary artery dissection that was revascularized with coronary artery bypass
  grafting who progressed to end-stage heart failure. She was listed for cardiac transplantation,
  and a suitable organ became available. She underwent heart transplantation more
  than 1 year ago successfully. This is the first reported case of a successful heart
  transplantation in an individual with Loeys-Dietz syndrome.
