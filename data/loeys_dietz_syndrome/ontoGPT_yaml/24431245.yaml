input_text: 'Cerebral arterial angioplasty in a patient with Loeys-Dietz syndrome.
  A 14-year-old boy with Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) had an acute neurologic decline
  6 days after a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Cerebral angiography at presentation did
  not show an aneurysmal source of the hemorrhage. However, on post-bleed day 6 the
  patient experienced an acutely worsening headache and subsequently lost consciousness.
  Head CT showed new subarachnoid blood and repeat angiography demonstrated a basilar
  tip aneurysm. Endovascular coil embolization was performed and his neurologic status
  improved postoperatively until post-bleed day 9 when he became unresponsive. A CT
  angiogram demonstrated severe proximal vasospasm. After an unsuccessful attempt
  to treat the vasospasm medically, the patient was transported to the neurointerventional
  suite for intra-arterial vasodilator treatment, which also failed to ameliorate
  the vasospasm. The endovascular surgeons were then faced with the conundrum of attempting
  a high-risk cerebral angioplasty in a pediatric patient with LDS or returning to
  maximal medical treatment for severe refractory vasospasm. '
