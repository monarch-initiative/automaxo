input_text: 'Parental-reported neurodevelopmental issues in Loeys-Dietz syndrome.
  BACKGROUND: Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) is a congenital multisystem disorder affecting
  the cardiovascular and musculoskeletal system. Limited data have reported neurodevelopmental
  (ND) issues in LDS. AIMS: To determine the extent of ND issues in patients with
  LDS. METHODS: A prospective study was performed of LDS patients or their caregivers.
  The study included data collected via an online survey of age-specific questions.
  Standard statistical methods were used for baseline and demographic characteristics,
  as well as group comparisons. OUTCOMES: Data were obtained from 67 patients with
  LDS (54% female). Median age was 14.9 years. Gene mutations included TGFBR1 (39%),
  TGFBR2 (40%), SMAD3 (7%), and unknown (14%). Motor delays (30%, 18/61) and hypotonia
  (63%, 37/60) occurred frequently. Physical (62%, 39/62), occupational (41%, 23/56),
  and speech therapies (34%, 20/58) were common. Feeding issues were common (41%,
  23/56). TGFBR1 mutations were more frequent among those with motor delays and feeding
  issues. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with LDS and/or their caregivers report at least one
  ND problem in most cases, and many require therapies. These data suggest ND disorders
  should be considered to be part of the phenotype.'
