input_text: 'Economic and care considerations of Marfan syndrome. INTRODUCTION: Marfan
  syndrome is a rare multisystem disease of the connective tissue, which affects multiple
  organ systems. advances in healthcare have doubled the life-expectancy of patients
  over the past three decades. to date, there is no comprehensive review that consolidates
  economic considerations and care for marfan patients. Areas covered: Present research
  suggests that there may be a link between treatment pattern, disease progression
  and economic costs of Marfan syndrome. It indicates that an early detection of the
  disease and preventive interventions achieve a dual aim. From a patient perspective,
  it may reduce the amount of emergency surgery or intervention, and inpatient stays.
  In addition, it slows disease progression, lowers lifestyle restrictions, reduces
  psychological stress, and improves health-related quality of life. Expert commentary:
  Early detection and preventive measures are likely to achieve a dual aim by simultaneously
  containing costs and reducing the number and length of inpatient stays.'
