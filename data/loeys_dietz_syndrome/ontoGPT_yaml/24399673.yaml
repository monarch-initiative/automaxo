input_text: Percutanous closure of left ventricular aneurysms in a patient with Loeys-Dietz
  syndrome. We report a case of percutaneous closure of multiple left ventricular
  aneurysms in a patient with inherited aortic-aneurysm syndrome-the Loeys-Dietz syndrome.
  One aneurysm was a true aneurysm in the subaortic region and the second one was
  a pseudoaneurysm at the left ventricular apex. The patient was a high-risk candidate
  for repeated operations. Both aneurysms were closed successfully percutaneously
  in staged procedures. There were no complications. The patient remained clinically
  well with stable echocardiographic results upon reassessment. This case illustrated
  that catheter-based closure of left ventricular aneurysms is a feasible approach
  in the context of connective tissue abnormalities related to the Loeys-Dietz syndrome.
