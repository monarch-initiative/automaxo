input_text: Toward precision medicine in vascular connective tissue disorders. Tremendous
  progress has been made in understanding the etiology, pathogenesis, and treatment
  of inherited vascular connective tissue disorders. While new insights regarding
  disease etiology and pathogenesis have informed patient counseling and care, there
  are numerous obstacles that need to be overcome in order to achieve the full promise
  of precision medicine. In this review, these issues will be discussed in the context
  of Marfan syndrome and Loeys-Dietz syndrome, with additional emphasis on the pioneering
  contributions made by Victor McKusick.
