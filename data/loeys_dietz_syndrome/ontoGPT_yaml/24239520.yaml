input_text: First implantation of Gore Hybrid Vascular Graft in the right vertebral
  artery for cerebral debranching in a patient with Loeys-Dietz syndrome. A 53-year-old
  woman with Loeys-Dietz syndrome developed progressive subclavian artery aneurysm
  and common carotid artery dissection. She was treated successfully by plugging and
  coiling of the subclavian aneurysm and its side branches after combined cervical
  debranching using standard carotid-axillary bypass and Gore Hybrid Vascular Graft
  for vertebral revascularization. Follow-up control (4 weeks) documented patent debranching,
  and only minimal residual flow in the subclavian aneurysm. The described off-label
  use for sutureless cerebral revascularisation of the vertebral artery might be a
  fast, simple, and reliable solution for cervical debranching in selective challenging
  patients. Further studies are necessary to evaluate side effects and durability.
