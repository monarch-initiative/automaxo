input_text: 'Treatment of chronic chest wall pain in a patient with Loeys-Dietz syndrome
  using spinal cord stimulation. OBJECTIVE: Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has been
  used with increased frequency for the treatment of intractable pain including chronic
  chest pain. METHODS: The patient with a history of Loeys-Dietz syndrome who underwent
  repair of pectus excavatum with subsequent chronic chest wall pain underwent an
  uneventful SCS trial with percutaneous epidural placement of two temporary eight-electrode
  leads placed at the level of T3-T4-T5. RESULTS: After experiencing excellent pain
  relief over the next two days, the patient was implanted with permanent leads and
  rechargeable generator four weeks later and reported sustained pain relief at 12-month
  follow-up visit. CONCLUSION: SCS provides an effective, alternative treatment option
  for select patients with Loeys-Dietz syndrome who underwent repair of pectus excavatum
  with subsequent chronic chest wall pain who have failed conservative treatment.
  SCS may provide pain relief with advantages over conservative treatments and more
  invasive techniques.'
