input_text: "Hemodynamic instability during anesthesia in an adolescent with Loeys-Dietz
  syndrome: a case report. We present a case of a 12-year-old male with Loeys-Dietz
  syndrome (LDS), a rare life-threatening genetic disorder. Multiple manifestations
  of LDS were present, including easy bruising, aortic root dilatation, multiple areas
  of vessel tortuosity, and joint laxity. The patient's medications included a beta-blocker
  and an angiotensin II receptor antagonist for prophylaxis against further aortic
  root dilatation due to his LDS. He experienced intraoperative hemodynamic instability
  and became pulseless during an orthopedic procedure, which had to be abandoned.
  Anesthesia was reattempted 2 days after cessation of the patient's antihypertensive
  medications and was successful with only minor postoperative hypertension. "
