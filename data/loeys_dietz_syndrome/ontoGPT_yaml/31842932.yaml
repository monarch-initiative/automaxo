input_text: 'Oral health-related quality of life in Loeys-Dietz syndrome, a rare connective
  tissue disorder: an observational cohort study. BACKGROUND: Loeys-Dietz syndrome
  (LDS) is a rare connective tissue disorder whose oral manifestations and dental
  phenotypes have not been well-characterized. The aim of this study was to explore
  the influence of oral manifestations on oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL)
  in LDS patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: LDS subjects were assessed by the craniofacial
  team at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center Dental Clinic between
  June 2015 and January 2018. Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14) questionnaire,
  oral health self-care behavior questionnaire and a comprehensive dental examination
  were completed for each subject. OHRQoL was assessed using the OHIP-14 questionnaire
  with higher scores corresponding to worse OHRQoL. Regression models were used to
  determine the relationship between each oral manifestation and the OHIP-14 scores
  using a level of significance of p <= 0.05. RESULTS: A total of 33 LDS subjects
  (51.5% female) aged 3-57 years (19.6 +- 15.1 years) were included in the study.
  The OHIP-14 scores (n = 33) were significantly higher in LDS subjects (6.30 [SD
  6.37]) when compared to unaffected family member subjects (1.50 [SD 2.28], p < 0.01),
  and higher than the previously reported scores of the general U.S. population (2.81
  [SD 0.12]). Regarding oral health self-care behavior (n = 32), the majority of LDS
  subjects reported receiving regular dental care (81%) and maintaining good-to-excellent
  daily oral hygiene (75%). Using a crude regression model, worse OHRQoL was found
  to be associated with dental hypersensitivity (beta = 5.24; p < 0.05), temporomandibular
  joints (TMJ) abnormalities (beta = 5.92; p < 0.01), self-reported poor-to-fair oral
  health status (beta = 6.77; p < 0.01), and cumulation of four or more oral manifestations
  (beta = 7.23; p < 0.001). Finally, using a parsimonious model, self-reported poor-to-fair
  oral health status (beta = 5.87; p < 0.01) and TMJ abnormalities (beta = 4.95; p
  < 0.01) remained significant. CONCLUSIONS: The dental hypersensitivity, TMJ abnormalities,
  self-reported poor-to-fair oral health status and cumulation of four-or-more oral
  manifestations had significant influence on worse OHRQoL. Specific dental treatment
  guidelines are necessary to ensure optimal quality of life in patients diagnosed
  with LDS.'
