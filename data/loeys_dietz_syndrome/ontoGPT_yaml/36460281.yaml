input_text: 'HTAD patient pathway: Strategy for diagnostic work-up of patients and
  families with (suspected) heritable thoracic aortic diseases (HTAD). A statement
  from the HTAD working group of VASCERN. Heritable thoracic aortic diseases (HTAD)
  are rare pathologies associated with thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissection, which
  can be syndromic or non-syndromic. They may result from genetic defects. Associated
  genes identified to date are classified into those encoding components of the (a)
  extracellular matrix (b) TGFbeta pathway and (c) smooth muscle contractile mechanism.
  Timely diagnosis allows for prompt aortic surveillance and prophylactic surgery,
  hence improving life expectancy and reducing maternal complications as well as providing
  reassurance to family members when a diagnosis is ruled out. This document is an
  expert opinion reflecting strategies put forward by medical experts and patient
  representatives involved in the HTAD Rare Disease Working Group of VASCERN. It aims
  to provide a patient pathway that improves patient care by diminishing time to diagnosis,
  facilitating the establishment of a correct diagnosis using molecular genetics when
  possible, excluding the diagnosis in unaffected persons through appropriate family
  screening and avoiding overuse of resources. It is being recommended that patients
  are referred to an expert centre for further evaluation if they meet at least one
  of the following criteria: (1) thoracic aortic dissection (<70 years if hypertensive;
  all ages if non-hypertensive), (2) thoracic aortic aneurysm (all adults with Z score
  >3.5 or 2.5-3.5 if non-hypertensive or hypertensive and <60 years; all children
  with Z score >3), (3) family history of HTAD with/without a pathogenic variant in
  a gene linked to HTAD, (4) ectopia lentis without other obvious explanation and
  (5) a systemic score of >5 in adults and >3 in children. Aortic imaging primarily
  relies on transthoracic echocardiography with magnetic resonance imaging or computed
  tomography as needed. Genetic testing should be considered in those with a high
  suspicion of underlying genetic aortopathy. Though panels vary among centers, for
  patients with thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection or systemic features these
  should include genes with a definitive or strong association to HTAD. Genetic cascade
  screening and serial aortic imaging should be considered for family screening and
  follow-up. In conclusion, the implementation of these strategies should help standardise
  the diagnostic work-up and follow-up of patients with suspected HTAD and the screening
  of their relatives.'
