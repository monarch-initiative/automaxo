input_text: 'Safety and outcome of gastrostomy tube placement in patients with Loeys-Dietz
  syndrome. BACKGROUND: Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) is a systemic connective tissue
  disease (CTD) associated with a predisposition for intestinal inflammation, food
  allergy, and failure to thrive, often necessitating nutritional supplementation
  via gastrostomy tube. Poor wound healing has also been observed in in some patients
  with CTD, potentially increasing the risk of surgical interventions. We undertook
  to determine the safety and efficacy of gastrostomy tube placement in this population.
  METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 10 LDS patients who had a
  total of 12 gastrostomy tubes placed. RESULTS: No procedural complications occurred,
  although one patient developed buried bumper syndrome in the near post-procedural
  time period and one patient had a small abscess at a surgical stitch. Most patients
  exhibited improvements in growth, with a median immediate improvement in BMI Z-score
  of 0.2 per month following the institution of gastrostomy tube feedings. Those with
  uncontrolled inflammation due to inflammatory bowel disease or eosinophilic gastrointestinal
  disease showed the least benefit and in some cases failed to demonstrate significant
  weight gain despite nutritional supplementation. CONCLUSIONS: Gastrostomy tube placement
  (surgical or endoscopic) is a generally safe and a reasonable therapeutic option
  for patients with LDS despite their underlying CTD.'
