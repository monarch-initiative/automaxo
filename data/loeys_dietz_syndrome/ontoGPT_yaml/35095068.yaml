input_text: Proposed Management Policy for Pregnant Women with Loeys-Dietz Syndrome
  Following Prophylactic Aortic Root Replacement Based on Experience from a Tertiary
  Care Center. Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) is a connective tissue disorder with a high
  incidence of aortic dissection (AD). After treating two previously reported cases
  of postpartum AD in women with LDS following prophylactic aortic root replacement
  (ARR), we succeeded in managing a 30-year-old primigravida with no AD during her
  peripartum period. On the basis of the patient's stated desire to conceive during
  preconception counseling, a multidisciplinary team was assembled. She conceived
  naturally after receiving prophylactic ARR and beta-blocker treatment. Multidisciplinary
  patient care included precise blood pressure management, continuation of beta-blocker
  treatment, cardiovascular assessment with echocardiogram, regional anesthesia during
  labor, prevention of lactation, and resumption of angiotensin II receptor blocker
  therapy immediately after delivery. On the basis of our assessment of three cases,
  including this case, and a literature review, we propose a peripartum management
  strategy for patients with LDS following prophylactic ARR.
