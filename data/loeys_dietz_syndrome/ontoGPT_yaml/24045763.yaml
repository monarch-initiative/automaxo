input_text: 'A patient with Loeys-Dietz syndrome treated with chemoradiotherapy for
  an oropharyngeal carcinoma. We present the first published case of a patient with
  Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) who was treated with radical chemoradiotherapy for an
  oropharyngeal carcinoma. In view of this newly recognised connective tissue disease,
  the uncertainty of severe toxicity from chemoradiotherapy to treat a potentially
  curative cancer posed a management challenge. The patient was treated with chemoradiotherapy
  and remains well with no evidence of recurrence at 3 years. Furthermore, we have
  observed minimal late effects secondary to chemoradiotherapy at 3 years following
  the completion of treatment suggesting that the underlying pathogenesis of LDS may
  provide an interesting human model to further elucidate the complex interactions
  of transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) and tissue fibrosis secondary to
  chemoradiotherapy. A review of LDS as well as the association of TGF-beta1 expression
  and tissue fibrosis is presented. '
