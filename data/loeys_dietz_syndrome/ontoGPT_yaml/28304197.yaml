input_text: 'Endovascular treatment of a dural arteriovenous fistula in a patient
  with Loeys-Dietz syndrome: A case report. Background Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS)
  is a recently recognized autosomal dominant connective tissue disease. The manifestations
  of LDS include vascular tortuosity, scoliosis, craniosynostosis, aneurysm and aortic
  dissections. Clinical presentation A 35-year-old woman treated with Stanford type
  B aortic dissection and breast cancer was referred to us for Borden type II dural
  arteriovenous fistula (dAVF) draining to the vein of Galen, involving the midline
  of tentorium cerebelli. The dAVF was treated successfully by combined transarterial
  and transvenous embolization. Because of tortuosity of vertebral arteries, a genetic
  test was conducted confirming LDS type 2. Conclusions To our knowledge, this is
  the first case report of dAVF associated with LDS. The relationship between LDS
  and dAVF is unknown but this report shows the possibility that mutation of transforming
  growth factor beta receptors 2 ( TGFBR2) related to LDS may be related to shunt
  diseases. Because intervention in LDS seems to be feasible compared to Ehlers Danlos
  syndrome and Marfan syndrome, it is important to make the correct diagnosis.'
