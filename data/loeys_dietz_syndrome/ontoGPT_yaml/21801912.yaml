input_text: 'Valve-sparing aortic root replacement in Loeys-Dietz syndrome. BACKGROUND:
  Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) is a recently recognized aggressive aortic disorder characterized
  by root aneurysm, arterial tortuosity, hypertelorism, and bifid uvula or cleft palate.
  The results of prophylactic root replacement using valve-sparing procedures (valve-sparing
  root replacement [VSRR]) in patients with LDS is not known. METHODS: We reviewed
  all patients with clinical and genetic (transforming growth factor-beta receptor
  mutations) evidence of LDS who underwent VSRR at our institution. Echocardiographic
  and clinical data were obtained from hospital and follow-up clinic records. RESULTS:
  From 2002 to 2009, 31 patients with a firm diagnosis of LDS underwent VSRR for aortic
  root aneurysm. Mean age was 15 years, and 24 (77%) were children. One (3%) patient
  had a bicuspid aortic valve. Preoperative sinus diameter was 3.9+-0.8 cm (z score
  7.0+-2.9) and 2 (6%) had greater than 2+ aortic insufficiency. Thirty patients (97%)
  underwent reimplantation procedures using a Valsalva graft. There were no operative
  deaths. Mean follow-up was 3.6 years (range, 0 to 7 years). One patient required
  late repair of a pseudoaneurysm at the distal aortic anastomosis, and 1 had a conversion
  to a David reimplantation procedure after a Florida sleeve operation. No patient
  suffered thromboembolism or endocarditis, and 1 (3%) patient experienced greater
  than 2+ late aortic insufficiency. No patient required late aortic valve repair
  or replacement. CONCLUSIONS: Loeys-Dietz syndrome is an aggressive aortic aneurysm
  syndrome that can be addressed by prophylactic aortic root replacement with low
  operative risk. Valve-sparing procedures have encouraging early and midterm results,
  similar to those in Marfan syndrome, and are an attractive option for young patients.'
