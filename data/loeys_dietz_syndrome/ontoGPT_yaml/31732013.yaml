input_text: 'Occiput-to-Pelvis Spinal Arthrodesis: A Case Series. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective
  case series. OBJECTIVES: To describe the indications, operative course, and outcomes
  in eight pediatric patients who underwent occiput-to-pelvis (O-P) spinal arthrodesis.
  SUMMARY: Spinal arthrodesis from the occiput to pelvis is needed for some children
  with extensive spine deformity. There are few reports of patients with O-P arthrodesis.
  METHODS: We reviewed records of pediatric patients who underwent spinal arthrodesis
  to treat spine deformity between 1987 and 2017 at one institution. Eight patients
  (six girls) who underwent staged O-P arthrodesis were identified. Underlying conditions,
  indications for surgery, medical comorbidities, operative courses, complications,
  and imaging of these patients were recorded. RESULTS: Diagnoses were neuromuscular
  disorders in five patients and syndromic disorders in three patients. Mean ages
  were 9.7 +- 4.1 years at index surgery and 16.8 +- 4.6 years at completion of O-P
  arthrodesis. Patients underwent a mean of three operations (range, two to five).
  Occipitocervical arthrodesis was the final operation in six of eight patients (all
  but the two patients with Loeys-Dietz syndrome). Mean follow-up after the last procedure
  was 8.5 +- 7.1 years. Two patients underwent revision for protruding occipital implants,
  and one patient underwent revision for thoracic pseudarthrosis. No patients developed
  postoperative infections or new neurologic deficits. At final follow-up, Scoliosis
  Research Society-22r questionnaire scores were lowest for Function (2.6 +- 1.0 of
  5 possible points) and highest for Satisfaction (4.1 +- 1.4). CONCLUSIONS: O-P arthrodesis
  can benefit patients with extensive spine deformity from neuromuscular or syndromic
  causes. Patients were young at first operation, which may suggest that younger patients
  are at higher risk than older patients of major progression of deformity in other
  spinal regions after deformity correction. Health-related quality of life and radiographic
  outcomes suggest that patients who underwent O-P arthrodesis had satisfactory outcomes
  and maintenance of correction during a mean of 8.5 years of follow-up. LEVEL OF
  EVIDENCE: Level IV, therapeutic study.'
