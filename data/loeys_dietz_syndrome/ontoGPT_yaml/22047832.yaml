input_text: Endovascular repair of an internal mammary artery aneurysm in a patient
  with Loeys-Dietz syndrome. Loeys-Dietz syndrome is a condition that predisposes
  the development of central and peripheral arterial aneurysms and dissections. The
  standard approach for treatment of these lesions has been open repair. We present
  the case of a 34-year-old woman with a previous history of multiple open aortic
  repairs who presented with a right large internal mammary artery aneurysm. The patient
  was successfully treated with endovascular coil embolization. This case report demonstrates
  the feasibility of using endovascular interventions to treat unusual aneurysms in
  patients with Loeys-Dietz syndrome.
