input_text: 'LOEYS-DIETZ SYNDROME: PERIOPERATIVE ANESTHESIA CONSIDERATIONS. Loeys-Dietz
  syndrome (LDS) is a rare autosomal dominant disease related to genetic mutations
  in receptors for the cytokine transforming growth factor-receptor type 1 (TGFB-R1)
  or 2 gene (TGFB-R2) on the cell surface. LDS results in abnormal protein synthesis
  and dysfunctional connective tissue, which can result in unique cardiovascular anesthesia
  challenges related to perioperative management. Patients with LDS may manifest hypertelorism,
  bifid uvula or cleft palate, and arterial tortuosity. Virtually all LDS patients
  show some type of abnormal skin findings and bleeding tendency. These patients may
  show a rapid progression of aortic dilation, regurgitation, and a propensity towards
  rupture and/or dissection at a much earlier age and smaller aneurysm size. LDS patients
  who require surgical intervention require meticulous vigilance from the anesthesiologist.
  We describe a 26 year old patient with documented LDS type 1 who presented for repair
  of an ascending/root aneurysm in this case report. Recognition of LDS and intra-operative
  management of the cardiovascular manifestations of this disease is paramount in
  ensuring successful surgical outcome and to limit morbidity and mortality.'
