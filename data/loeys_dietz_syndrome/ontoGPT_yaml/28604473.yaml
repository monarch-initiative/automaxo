input_text: 'Perioperative Anesthetic Management for Cesarean Delivery in a Parturient
  With Type IV Loeys-Dietz Syndrome: A Case Report. Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) is
  a rare connective tissue disorder predisposing to aortic and arterial aneurysms.
  Presentations are classified into subtypes based on gene mutations. Pregnancy in
  patients with LDS is considered very high risk due to the potential for aortic dissection
  and uterine rupture. We report successful management of an elective cesarean delivery
  in a 16-year-old patient with LDS type IV using epidural anesthesia. Perioperative
  considerations and multidisciplinary management specific to taking care of parturients
  with LDS are discussed.'
