input_text: 'Loeys-Dietz syndrome and pregnancy: The first ten years. The physiological
  and haemodynamic changes that occur in pregnancy and the postpartum period increase
  the risk of aortic dissection. Loeys-Dietz syndrome results from mutations in the
  genes encoding components of the TGF-beta signalling pathway; aortic pathology is
  of particular concern in this condition but other vascular abnormalities can also
  be present. Significant maternal morbidity and mortality has been described in patients
  with Loeys-Dietz syndrome, but successful and uncomplicated pregnancies are still
  possible. Nevertheless, all patients with this condition should, at present, be
  treated as very high risk in pregnancy and the postpartum period, until reliable
  risk prediction tools become available. This review summarises the recent advances
  in the understanding of the pathophysiology of this condition, and the management
  strategies currently advocated.'
