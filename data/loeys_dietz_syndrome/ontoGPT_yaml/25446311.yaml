input_text: '[Genetics and prevention of genetic aortic syndromes (GAS) and of the
  Marfan syndrome]. BACKGROUND: Genetic aortic syndromes are autosomal-dominantly
  heritable aneurysms of the thoracic aorta, which carry a high risk of aortic rupture
  or acute thoracic aortic dissection at young age. OBJECTIVES: We introduce the reader
  to the principles of genetic diagnostics and the medical and surgical prevention
  of thoracic aortic dissection in patients with genetic aortic syndromes. METHODS:
  A cardiologist, a health economist, a patient representative, a heart surgeon, and
  a molecular geneticist teamed up to elucidate their perspective on major aspects
  of genetics and prevention of genetic aortic syndromes. RESULTS: Genetic aortic
  syndromes reflect a broad spectrum of diverse disease entities comprising the Marfan
  syndrome, the Loeys-Dietz syndrome or the vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. The diagnosis
  of each respective disease entity requires combined assessment of phenotype and
  genotype information. A medical prevention of aortic complications such as dissection
  is mandatory although a curative therapy currently appears unlikely in humans. The
  single most important measure against acute aortic dissection is the preventive
  replacement of the aortic root, where valve preserving techniques appear preferable.
  Comprehensive prophylaxis including molecular diagnostics seem reasonable also from
  an economic point of view. DISCUSSION: Optimal prevention requires individualization
  of concepts, which entail a detailed diagnostic characterization of each specific
  genetic aortic syndrome including characterization of the genotype.'
