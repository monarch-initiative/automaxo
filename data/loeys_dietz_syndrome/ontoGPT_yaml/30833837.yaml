input_text: 'Preventing a Catastrophe: Increasing Awareness of Loeys-Dietz Syndrome.
  Loeys-Dietz syndrome is a genetic disorder that predisposes patients to aortic aneurysms.
  If left untreated, the natural history of the associated aortopathy often culminates
  in fatal aortic dissection. We describe the case of a 21-year-old man who was diagnosed
  with Loeys-Dietz syndrome after 2 family members died of aortic dissection. This
  case highlights the importance of increased physician awareness of this syndrome,
  which can play a crucial role in preventing premature sudden cardiac death caused
  by aortic catastrophe.'
