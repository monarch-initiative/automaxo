input_text: Delayed diagnosis of Loeys-Dietz syndrome revealed through atrial septal
  defect with pulmonary artery dilation. Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) is an autosomal-dominant
  connective tissue disorder associated with mutations in the transforming growth
  factor beta receptor. It is characterized by distinctive craniofacial changes, skeletal
  features, and cardiovascular complications. We present a case of a 24-year-old male
  with development delay and a one-year history of progressively worsening dyspnea
  on moderate exertion and orthopnea. Echocardiography revealed right atrial and right
  ventricle dilation, right ventricle hypertrophy, atrial septal defect, and aneurysmal
  dilation of the pulmonary artery trunk. This case underscores the importance of
  early detection and comprehensive imaging in patients suspected of having LDS, particularly
  considering the potential for atypical vascular manifestations.
