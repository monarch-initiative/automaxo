input_text: 'Curative reconstruction of a cerebral aneurysm by flow diversion with
  the Pipeline embolisation device in a patient with Loeys-Dietz syndrome. Loeys-Dietz
  syndrome is a recently described connective tissue disorder with a natural history
  of extreme vessel tortuosity and aggressive arterial aneurysm formation and rupture.
  This is the case of a 23-year-old woman with a large, dysplastic cavernous aneurysm
  who had successful endovascular treatment by flow diversion with the Pipeline embolisation
  device. Ten-month follow-up demonstrated complete aneurysm occlusion and curative
  reconstruction of the parent vessel without evidence of vessel injury or dissection.
  Endovascular treatment with flow-diverting devices is a valid treatment option and
  can be performed safely and effectively in this complex patient population. '
