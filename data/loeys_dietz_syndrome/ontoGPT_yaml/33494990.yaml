input_text: 'Postpartum Stanford type B aortic dissection in a woman with Loeys-Dietz
  syndrome who underwent a prophylactic aortic root replacement before conception:
  A case report. OBJECTIVE: Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) is associated with a higher
  risk of aortic dissections (ADs) during pregnancy and postpartum. However, there
  is limited evidence about the perinatal management of LDS patients who have undergone
  prophylactic aortic root replacements (ARRs) before conception. CASE REPORT: We
  present the case of a 28-year-old nulliparous pregnant woman with LDS with a pathogenic
  variant within exon 5 of TGFBR2 (c.1379G > T, p.[Arg460Leu]), who underwent an ARR
  at 20 years of age. Cardiac echocardiography did not show any significant changes
  in the aorta during pregnancy, and her blood pressure remained normal. She had a
  cesarean section at 37 weeks of gestation. She developed an acute Stanford type
  B AD extending from the aortic arch to the infrarenal aorta 8 days postpartum and
  underwent a total arch replacement. CONCLUSION: This case report suggests that patients
  with LDS after prophylactic ARRs still possess a risk for Stanford type B ADs.'
