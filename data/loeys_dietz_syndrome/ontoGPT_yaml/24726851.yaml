input_text: 'Aorta pathology and pregnancy. In addition to the haemodynamic changes
  in pregnancy, hormones also induce changes in the aortic wall. Women with diseases
  like Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlo syndrome, or other aortic abnormalities, have
  an increased risk of complications during pregnancy. Counselling and risk assessment
  before pregnancy is mandatory for all women with known aortic disease. Proper information
  should be provided about the risks of morbidity and mortality during pregnancy and
  information on the risks for the fetus, including the potential recurrence of disease
  in the offspring. Evaluation of past medical and family history, the aortic size
  before conception, and any increase in size before and during pregnancy, is essential
  to try and estimate the risk of aortic dissection. If the aorta is dilated, prophylactic
  repair before pregnancy may be indicated. In some cases, elective surgery during
  pregnancy may be warranted. In women with a severely dilated ascending aorta, caesarean
  section is, at present, the advised mode of delivery. '
