Treatment depends on their characteristics: surgery, sclerotherapy, both combined, systemic treatment or observation. This study aims to analyze the surgical and interventional management of LMs in children over the last two decades in our university hospital. METHODS: Management of children born with LMs between 2000 and 2019 was reviewed. Parameters collected were: malformation characteristics, type of treatment, symptoms, imaging, timing of diagnosis and first treatment, number of interventions, recovery rate, complications and length of stay. RESULTS: Files of 48 children were reviewed: 27 with macrocystic and 21 with microcystic LMs. There was no statistically significant difference in type of treatment except for combined treatment, more performed in microcystic LMs (p = 0.04). Symptoms, imaging, timing of diagnosis and first treatment, number of interventions and complications were not statistically significant. Overall, the number of surgeries was lower than sclerotherapies (p = 0.04). Recovery rate after surgery was higher in macrocystic LMs (p = 0.01). Complications and length of stay were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: A good rate of recovery was observed when surgery was performed, with no significant increase in complications and length of stay. A prospective study will be determinant to create a decisional algorithm for children with LMs.",

                    "abstract": "This retrospective study examines the outcomes of sclerotherapy in children with (veno)lymphatic malformations who received sclerotherapy between 2011 and 2016 (116 children, 234 procedures). Complication severity was classified using the Society of Interventional Radiology classification. Clinical response was rated on a scale of 0 (no change) to 3 (good improvement). The sclerosants used were bleomycin (n = 132; 56%), lauromacrogol (n = 42; 18%), doxycycline (n = 15; 6%), ethanol (n = 12; 5%), or a combination (n = 33; 14%). Four major and 25 minor complications occurred without significant differences between the agents. The median response rate per procedure was 2-some improvement-for all sclerosants. However, in pure LMs (67%), bleomycin and a combination of agents resulted in the best clinical response. On patient level, all had some or good clinical response. Mixed macrocystic and microcystic lesions showed a significantly lower clinical response (median 2 versus 3; p = 0.023 and p = 0.036, respectively) and required significantly more procedures (median 2 versus 1; p = 0.043 and p = 0.044, respectively) compared with lesions with one component.Conclusion: Sclerotherapy for (V)LMs in children is safe and effective. Bleomycin is the most frequently used agent in this clinic and seemed most effective for pure LMs. Mixed macrocystic and microcystic lesions are most difficult to treat effectively. What is Known:   A variety of agents can be used for sclerotherapy of lymphatic malformations in children.   Macrocystic lesions have favorable outcomes compared with microcystic and mixed lesions. What is New:   Bleomycin and a combination of agents seem to be most effective to treat lymphatic malformations in children.   Mixed macrocystic and microcystic lesions are more difficult to treat effectively compared with lesions with either one of these components.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The patients with cervical-facial lymphatic malformations were reviewed in Shanghai Children's Hospital from August 2014 to August 2018. Data analysis was performed using SPSS17.0. Pearson X2 test and t-test were used, and the significance level was fixed at 5%. RESULTS: 72 patients in all of which 63 patients underwent surgical excision combined with bleomycin irrigation and 9 patients underwent sclerotherapy alone as the primary treatment. The surgical excision group had a significantly higher rate of an excellent response compare to the sclerotherapy group (P < 0.05). In regards to postoperative complications, the surgical group had no higher rate of temporal facial paralysis and other nerve injures compare to the sclerotherapy group (P = 0.624). CONCLUSIONS: we recommend surgery combined with Bleomycin for microcystic disease with focal and less infiltrative lesions and for lesions located in the oropharynx, parapharynx, retropharynx, or hypopharynx.",

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of literature until 16 November 2021 was performed on treatments of LMs in the head and neck. RESULTS: Out of 9044 articles, 54 studies were eligible for inclusion with 26 studies providing detailed participant data. A total number of 1573 patients with a mean age of 21.22 months were analysed. Comparative meta-analysis did not reveal significant differences two proportions of volume reduction (>= 50% and 100%) between sclerotherapy and surgical treatment. Regression demonstrated that positive predictors for volume reduction were surgery 17 (95% CI 0.26-34; p = 0.047) and treatment of macrocystic lesions 19 (95% CI 5.5-32; p = 0.006). Treatment of mixed lesions also demonstrated a trend towards achieving a greater volume reduction (p = 0.052). A higher de Serres stage of the lesion had a negative effect on the amount of volume reduction - 3.7 (95% CI - 7.0 to - 0.35; p = 0.030). CONCLUSION: This comprehensive meta-analysis demonstrated no significant difference in volume reduction between various treatment modalities at study level. However, individual patient data indicated that surgery and larger cyst types are associated with a significant higher percentage of volume reduction, whereas a higher de Serres stage negatively impacted the amount of volume reduction. These findings can be used for patient counseling and treatment planning based on cyst type and de Serres stage. However volume reduction constitutes just one objective within a more complex treatment spectrum.",

Understanding lymphatic malformation natural history is essential. We describe management of head and neck lymphatic malformations where decisions primarily addressed lesion-induced functional compromise (ie, breathing, swallowing) to identify factors associated with invasive treatment and active observation. We hypothesize that non-function threatening malformations can be observed. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series. METHODS: Retrospective case series of consecutive head and neck lymphatic malformation patients (2000-2017) with over 2 years of follow-up. Patient characteristics were summarized and associations with invasive treatment (surgery or sclerotherapy) tested using Fisher's exact. In observed patients, factors associated with spontaneous regression were assessed with Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: Of 191 patients, 101 (53%) were male, 97 (51%) Caucasian, and 98 (51.3%) younger than 3 months. Malformations were de Serres I-III 167 (87%), or IV-V 24 (12%), and commonly located in the neck (101, 53%), or oral cavity (36, 19%). Initial treatments included observation (65, 34%) or invasive treatments such as primary surgery (80, 42%), staged surgery (25, 13%), or primary sclerotherapy (9, 5%). Of 65 initially observed malformations, 8 (12%) subsequently had invasive treatment, 36 (58%) had spontaneous regression, and 21 (32%) elected for no invasive therapy. Spontaneous regression was associated with location in the lateral neck (P = .003) and macrocystic malformations (P = .017). CONCLUSION: Head and neck lymphatic malformation treatment selection can be individualized after stratifying by stage, presence of functional compromise, and consideration of natural history. Recognizing the spectrum of severity is essential in evaluating efficacy of emerging treatments, as selected malformations may respond to observation.

Here, we describe severe adverse events (SAEs) observed during \"off-label use\" for vascular anomalies. METHODS: We performed a retrospective, multicenter chart review for SAEs during \"off-label\" sirolimus therapy for vascular anomalies and analyzed these cases by a predesigned workflow. RESULTS: We identified 17 SAEs in 14 patients diagnosed with generalized lymphatic anomaly (n = 4), Gorham-Stout disease (n = 2), central conducting lymphatic anomaly (n = 1), lymphatic malformation (n = 4), tufted angioma (n = 1), kaposiform hemangioendothelioma (n = 1), and venous malformation in a patient with CLOVES syndrome (n = 1). Three patients presented two SAEs each. The age at initiation of sirolimus therapy was under 2 years (n = 5), 2-6 years (n = 5), and older than 12 years (n = 4). SAEs occurred during the first 3 months of sirolimus therapy (n = 7), between 3 and 12 months (n = 7) and after 1 year of therapy (n = 3). The most frequent SAE was viral pneumonia (n = 8) resulting in one death due to a metapneumovirus infection in a 3 months old and a generalized adenovirus infection in a 28-month-old child. Sirolimus blood level at the time of SAEs ranged between 2.7 and 21 ng/L. Five patients were on antibiotic prophylaxis. CONCLUSIONS: Most SAEs are observed in the first year of sirolimus therapy; however, SAEs can also occur after a longer treatment period. SAEs are potentially life threatening, especially in early infancy. Presence of other risk factors, that is, underlying vascular anomaly or immune status, may contribute to the risk of SAEs.

Progressive cases may result in lethal outcomes and have proven difficult to treat. Sirolimus is showing promising results in the management of vascular anomalies. We examined the efficacy and safety of sirolimus treatment in patients with progressive LAs. METHODS: All patients with LAs treated with sirolimus from May 2015 to September 2018 were included. They received oral sirolimus once a day and the dose was adjusted so that the trough concentration remained within 5-15 ng/mL. We prospectively reviewed the response to drugs (the response rate of radiological volumetric change of the target lesion), severity scores, reported quality of life (QOL), and adverse effects at 6 months after administration. RESULTS: Twenty patients (five with cystic lymphatic malformation (LM), three with kaposiform lymphangiomatosis, three with generalized lymphatic anomaly, six with Gorham-Stout disease, and three with central conducting lymphatic anomaly) were treated with sirolimus at our institution. Fifty percent of patients (10/20) demonstrated a partial response by a radiological examination and a significant improvement in disease severity and QOL scores (P = 0.0020 and P = 0.0117, respectively). Ten patients who had no reduction in lesion size (stable disease group) showed no significant improvement in disease severity and QOL scores. Eighty percent of patients (16/20) had side effects, such as stomatitis, infection, and hyperlipidemia. CONCLUSIONS: Sirolimus impacts the reduction of the lymphatic tissue volume of LMs and could lead to improvement in clinical symptoms and QOL.

The current hypothesis is that the earlier the lesion is treated, the better it responds. This has prompted the idea that sirolimus administration might be efficacious to treat fetal LMs as well. Here we report a successful management of a cervicofacial fetal LM with sirolimus taken orally by the mother from the 22nd week of pregnancy until 2 weeks before planned delivery. Repeated cordocentesis recorded a 30% transplacental crossing of sirolimus. Continuation of sirolimus after birth allowed resection of the residual mass. We have followed the physical and neurological evolution of the child for 6 years since the fetal administration of sirolimus. We conclude that early administration of sirolimus during pregnancy with maternal serum monitoring may be proposed to high-risk fetal LMs in selected cases.",

We evaluated outcomes for CFLMs following sclerotherapy, surgical resection, and/or medical management. METHODS: We identified children with a CFLM at a vascular anomalies center from 2004 to 2019. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: retro-orbital malformations, untreated malformations, patients without follow-up. Primary clinical outcome was contour improvement, with significance defined as LM volume reduction of >50% by cross-sectional imaging. RESULTS: Sixty-three children met inclusion criteria: 35 with macrocystic CFLMs, six with microcystic CFLMs, and 22 with mixed-type malformations. Mean post-intervention follow-up was 27.5 months. Fifty-eight patients underwent sclerotherapy (median: two treatments). Doxycycline and/or bleomycin were used in 95% of patients. After sclerotherapy, 97% of macrocystic CFLMs improved significantly compared to 82% of mixed and 67% of microcystic lesions. Sixteen children underwent surgical resection with 75% significantly improving; two additional patients were successfully treated with sclerotherapy after debulking surgery. Six children received sirolimus for microcystic disease, of which 33% significantly improved. CONCLUSION: Sclerotherapy is very effective for macrocystic components of CFLMs, albeit less so for microcystic disease. Microcystic CFLMs frequently require surgical resection. Sirolimus is a helpful therapeutic adjunct, particularly for microcystic lesions, but more study is needed. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, prognosis study.",

Data on intralymphatic iodine exposure, risk factors for disease severity, and timing of hypothyroidism are limited. Case Descriptions: We report 4 cases of premature neonates with previously normal thyroid function tests (TFTs) who developed hypothyroidism after intralymphatic iodinated contrast. Patients 1 and 2, premature infants with complex medical histories, had chylous effusions and high-volume chest tube output requiring imaging with lymphangiograms on day of life (DOL) 97 and DOL 43, respectively. They developed severe, primary hypothyroidism with TSH of 335.7 mIU/mL (reference range, 1.7 to 9.1) on DOL 111 and TSH of 470.2 mIU/mL (reference range, 1.7 to 9.1) on DOL 68. Patient 3 had prenatally diagnosed fetal hydrops manifesting with chylous effusions and high-volume chest tube output. The infant underwent lymphangiography on DOL 90 and was noted to have an elevated TSH of 13.35 mIU/mL (reference range, 1.7 to 9.1) 4 days later with spot urine iodine of 1742 microg/L (normal, <200). Patient 4 had a lymphatic malformation and underwent sclerotherapy with doxycycline with intralymphatic iodine exposure on DOL 4 and was found to have a TSH of 16.7 microU/mL (reference range, 1.7 to 9.1) 3 days later with spot urine iodine of 228,712 microg/L (normal, <200). The TFT results for all patients improved after levothyroxine administration. Conclusion: Intralymphatic iodine should be considered a major risk factor in the development of iatrogenic primary hypothyroidism, especially in premature neonates soon after exposure. Close monitoring of TFTs is imperative to avoid potential long-term adverse outcomes in this population.",

Progressive growth of lesions may cause pressure to the surrounding organs. Lesions frequently reoccur after treatment with surgery, sclerotherapy, radiotherapy, and laser therapy. In the last decades, oral sirolimus has been successfully used in lymphatic malformations. Since systemic treatment with sirolimus is associated with various side effects, topical form of the drug has been used with satisfying results, especially for the angiofibromas. Promisingly, few case studies indicate topical sirolimus as a potential treatment for the lymphatic malformations. Here, we report an 8-year-old girl with MLM on left trunk whose lesions recurred after the surgery that has been performed at 1 year of age. We administered twice daily topical sirolimus at 0.75 mg/ml concentration. After 2 weeks, a local irritation occurred and the dose was decreased to once daily. The treatment was stopped at the end of 3 months as the lesions were almost cleared and the patient did not want to continue to therapy. There were no new lesions after 8 months of follow up.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Clinical studies have shown low toxicity and a favorable safety profile for sirolimus in vascular anomalies. Here, we describe severe adverse events (SAEs) observed during \"off-label use\" for vascular anomalies. METHODS: We performed a retrospective, multicenter chart review for SAEs during \"off-label\" sirolimus therapy for vascular anomalies and analyzed these cases by a predesigned workflow. RESULTS: We identified 17 SAEs in 14 patients diagnosed with generalized lymphatic anomaly (n = 4), Gorham-Stout disease (n = 2), central conducting lymphatic anomaly (n = 1), lymphatic malformation (n = 4), tufted angioma (n = 1), kaposiform hemangioendothelioma (n = 1), and venous malformation in a patient with CLOVES syndrome (n = 1). Three patients presented two SAEs each. The age at initiation of sirolimus therapy was under 2 years (n = 5), 2-6 years (n = 5), and older than 12 years (n = 4). SAEs occurred during the first 3 months of sirolimus therapy (n = 7), between 3 and 12 months (n = 7) and after 1 year of therapy (n = 3). The most frequent SAE was viral pneumonia (n = 8) resulting in one death due to a metapneumovirus infection in a 3 months old and a generalized adenovirus infection in a 28-month-old child. Sirolimus blood level at the time of SAEs ranged between 2.7 and 21 ng/L. Five patients were on antibiotic prophylaxis. CONCLUSIONS: Most SAEs are observed in the first year of sirolimus therapy; however, SAEs can also occur after a longer treatment period. SAEs are potentially life threatening, especially in early infancy. Presence of other risk factors, that is, underlying vascular anomaly or immune status, may contribute to the risk of SAEs. Sirolimus is an important therapeutic option for vascular anomalies, but patients and physicians need to be aware that adequate monitoring is necessary, especially in patients with complex lymphatic anomalies that are overrepresented in our cohort of SAEs.",

Few effective options exist in refractory cases. METHODS: Patients aged 0 to 12 months with refractory chylous ascites underwent retroperitoneal exploration after medical treatment and minimally invasive therapies were unsuccessful. The retroperitoneum was completely exposed via left and right medial visceral rotation and opening the lesser sac. Visible leaks were ligated, and alternating layers of fibrin glue and Vicryl mesh were used to cover the entire retroperitoneum. RESULTS: All 4 patients had resolution of their chylous ascites. None required reoperation or reintervention for chyle leaks. All achieved goal enteral feeds at a median of 29 days postoperatively and were discharged from hospital at a median of 42 days postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: Management of chylous ascites is extremely challenging in refractory cases. Complete retroperitoneal exposure with fibrin glue and Vicryl mesh application offers a definitive, reliable therapy for achieving cessation of lymphatic leakage and ultimate recovery for patients who fail all nonoperative approaches.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cutaneous microcystic lymphatic malformations (CMLMs) are rare conditions in children and adults. They present as clusters of vesicles full of lymph and blood to various extents, inducing maceration, esthetic impairment, pain, and impaired quality of life. The treatment is challenging. Sirolimus is an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) involved in angio-lymphangiogenesis. Topical sirolimus has recently been reported as effective in a few reports of patients with CMLMs. The objective is to compare the efficacy and safety of a 12-week application of 0.1% topical sirolimus versus topical vehicle in CMLMs in children and adults. METHODS: This French blinded multicenter within-person randomized controlled phase 2 trial aims to include 55 patients aged >= 6 years who have a primary CMLM. The CMLM will be divided into two equal areas that will be randomly allocated to 0.1% topical sirolimus or topical vehicle applied for 12 weeks. At the end of the 12-week period, the patient/parent will treat the whole area of CMLM with 0.1% topical sirolimus on remaining lesions, for eight more weeks. Patients will be seen at week 20 (treatment will be stopped) and at month 12 to evaluate long-term efficacy. The primary outcome will be improvement of the CMLM in the area treated with topical sirolimus compared to the area treated with topical vehicle by the investigator physician (blinded to the treatment) with the Physician Global Assessment score at week 12. Secondary outcomes will include: assessment of efficacy by independent experts on the basis of standardized photographs; impact on quality of life; efficacy for oozing, bleeding, erythema, and thickness evaluated by the investigators; and global efficacy as well as efficacy for functional and aesthetic impairment evaluated by the patient. Systemic passage of sirolimus will be measured at weeks 6, 12, and 20, and at week 16 for CMLMs >= 900 cm2. DISCUSSION: For patients with CMLMs, topical sirolimus could be a non-invasive and well-tolerated therapeutic option. If the trial demonstrates efficacy and safety of this treatment, this result will lead to a real change in the management of this condition, and 0.1% sirolimus cream would become the first-line treatment.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cutaneous microcystic lymphatic malformations (CMLMs) are rare conditions in children and adults. They present as clusters of vesicles full of lymph and blood to various extents, inducing maceration, esthetic impairment, pain, and impaired quality of life. The treatment is challenging. Sirolimus is an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) involved in angio-lymphangiogenesis. Topical sirolimus has recently been reported as effective in a few reports of patients with CMLMs. The objective is to compare the efficacy and safety of a 12-week application of 0.1% topical sirolimus versus topical vehicle in CMLMs in children and adults. METHODS: This French blinded multicenter within-person randomized controlled phase 2 trial aims to include 55 patients aged >= 6 years who have a primary CMLM. The CMLM will be divided into two equal areas that will be randomly allocated to 0.1% topical sirolimus or topical vehicle applied for 12 weeks. At the end of the 12-week period, the patient/parent will treat the whole area of CMLM with 0.1% topical sirolimus on remaining lesions, for eight more weeks. Patients will be seen at week 20 (treatment will be stopped) and at month 12 to evaluate long-term efficacy. The primary outcome will be improvement of the CMLM in the area treated with topical sirolimus compared to the area treated with topical vehicle by the investigator physician (blinded to the treatment) with the Physician Global Assessment score at week 12. Secondary outcomes will include: assessment of efficacy by independent experts on the basis of standardized photographs; impact on quality of life; efficacy for oozing, bleeding, erythema, and thickness evaluated by the investigators; and global efficacy as well as efficacy for functional and aesthetic impairment evaluated by the patient. Systemic passage of sirolimus will be measured at weeks 6, 12, and 20, and at week 16 for CMLMs >= 900 cm2. DISCUSSION: For patients with CMLMs, topical sirolimus could be a non-invasive and well-tolerated therapeutic option. If the trial demonstrates efficacy and safety of this treatment, this result will lead to a real change in the management of this condition, and 0.1% sirolimus cream would become the first-line treatment.

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE: To add to the current literature on single stage excision of head and neck vascular malformations with preoperative n-butyl cyanoacrylate (n-BCA) glue. Unlike previous studies, this series includes pediatric and adult patients, highlights a single stage partial excision of a complex venous malformation, and describes the first description of using glue prior to resection of a macrocystic lymphatic malformation. STUDY DESIGN: Case series with chart review. SETTING: Tertiary-care adult and pediatric hospital. SUBJECTS AND RESULTS: Four patients (3 males - 9, 13, 25 years, 1 female - 61 years) underwent same day excision of head and neck vascular malformations utilizing immediate preoperative n-BCA glue embolization performed by interventional radiology and otolaryngology, as described by Tieu et al. The indications for resection included bleeding (1/4), pain (3/4), cosmetic deformity (3/4), and discomfort with denture wear (1/4). Prior interventions included none (1/4), cautery and primary closure to control acute hemorrhage (1/4), and sclerotherapy (2/4). Treatments included complete embolization and resection of simple venous malformation (VM)s of the oral cavity/lip (2/4), partial embolization and resection of a complex hemifacial venous malformation (VM) (1/4), and complete embolization and resection of a lymphatic malformation (LM) (1/4). On average, 97 min of anesthesia time was added for the preoperative embolization procedure (range, 94-104 min). All patients had a successful embolization without need for coils. Operative time ranged from 28 to 44 min for the simple cases and was 6 h and 30 min for the complex case. There was minimal blood loss in all cases. There were no associated complications, lesion recurrences, or long-term deficits at an average follow-up of 5 months. The patient with the complex hemifacial VM demonstrated subtle lower facial weakness post-operatively, which completely resolved within two months. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of head and neck vascular malformations with preoperative n-BCA glue and subsequent surgical excision is a viable method for both simple and complex lesions. The safety and efficacy of this technique has been demonstrated in the past in a limited number of studies. This study further supports the use of this technique to address patient concerns such as pain or discomfort and cosmetic deformity, even if the lesion is only partially resectable. In our series a lymphatic malformation refractory to sclerotherapy was treated with a similar technique of glue and resection, following aspiration of the mucoid LM fluid. Our series emphasizes that pediatric vascular malformations carry functional and cosmetic deficits into adulthood that can and should be addressed in this patient population. Therefore, same-day embolization and resection should be coordinated when possible, in order to optimize patient safety and convenience.",

                    "abstract": "Objective:To present experience and evaluate the safety and efficacy of surgery combined with bleomycin irrigation for the management of head and neck lymphatic malformations in children. Methods:The medical records of all patients with cervical-facial lymphatic malformations who presented to Shanghai Children's Hospital from August 2014 to December 2020 were reviewed. 97 children were divided into surgery group(81 cases) and sclerotherapy group(16 cases). Conventional contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) and B-ultrasound examinations were performed both preoperatively and postoperatively. The surgical group received lymphangioma resection combined with bleomycin irrigation. The sclerotherapy group was treated with B-ultrasound-guided percutaneous lymphangioma aspiration and bleomycin sclerotherapy. SPSS 21.0 software was used to evaluate the clinical cure rate and postoperative complications of lesions in both groups by chi-square test. Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate the disease-free survival rate and draw survival curve. Results:In the surgery group of 81 children, 64 cases were cured and 17 cases were effective while in the sclerosis group, 8 cases were cured and 8 cases were effective. Cox proportional risk model found that children in the surgery group had a higher cure rate and a lower risk of 5-year recurrence than those in the sclerotherapy group, with statistically significant differences(chi2=5.814, P<0.05). The risk of recurrence in the surgery group was 35.4% of that in the sclerotherapy group(HR=0.354, P<0.05). In regards to postoperative complications, the surgical group had no higher rate of temporal facial paralysis and other nerve injuries compared to the sclerotherapy group(chi2=1.041, P=0.308). Conclusion:Surgery combined with bleomycin irrigation in the complex cervical-facial lymphatic malformations was confirmed to be effectively and safely. The principle of the surgery was to protect the structure and function of normal tissue while excising the lesions as much as possible. When the lesions involved the posterior two-thirds of the tongue, the floor of the mouth, parapharynx, retropharynx, or hypopharynx spaces. Radiofrequency ablation was used in the surgical excision, which made the surgery more minimally invasive, accurate and personalized.",

A serious long-term risk of intravenous bleomycin is dose-dependent interstitial pneumonitis. Little is known about absorption and circulating levels of bleomycin when used in sclerotherapy for patients with vascular malformations. This is an Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved prospective study on patients receiving bleomycin sclerotherapy in the management of vascular malformations. Depending on the type of vascular malformation, bleomycin was administered either in the lumen or interstitial space of the involved lesion. A bleomycin assay measured serum bleomycin plasma concentrations versus time at seven intervals following treatment. Pharmacokinetic parameters were obtained for each participant and included peak plasma concentration (Cmax ), time to reach peak plasma concentration (Tmax ), volume of distribution (Vd ), elimination half-life (t1/2 ), the volume of plasma cleared of the drug per unit time (CL), and total systemic exposure area under the curve (AUC). Fifteen patients were enrolled (5: lymphatic, 4: venous, 6: arteriovenous malformations). Bleomycin was administered interstitially (IS) in 11 patients and intraluminal (IL) in four; median age of 13 years (range: 2-67). Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed terminal elimination half-life (t1/2lambdaz ) of 88.51 (+-23.09) and 111.61 (+-37.75) minutes for the IS and IL groups, respectively. Vd was 4.86 L (+-6.74) and 1.55 L (+-0.54) for the IS and IL groups, respectively. AUC was 53.9 (+-23.45) and 129.17 (+-93.57) mg min/L for the IS and IL groups, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences in t1/2lambdaz , Vd , or AUC parameters between groups.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The patients with cervical-facial lymphatic malformations were reviewed in Shanghai Children's Hospital from August 2014 to August 2018. Data analysis was performed using SPSS17.0. Pearson X2 test and t-test were used, and the significance level was fixed at 5%. RESULTS: 72 patients in all of which 63 patients underwent surgical excision combined with bleomycin irrigation and 9 patients underwent sclerotherapy alone as the primary treatment. The surgical excision group had a significantly higher rate of an excellent response compare to the sclerotherapy group (P < 0.05). In regards to postoperative complications, the surgical group had no higher rate of temporal facial paralysis and other nerve injures compare to the sclerotherapy group (P = 0.624). CONCLUSIONS: we recommend surgery combined with Bleomycin for microcystic disease with focal and less infiltrative lesions and for lesions located in the oropharynx, parapharynx, retropharynx, or hypopharynx.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Severe congenital chylothorax (SCC) may result in respiratory failure, malnutrition, immunodeficiency, and sepsis. Although typically managed with bowel rest, parenteral nutrition, and octreotide, persistent chylothoraces require surgical management. At our institution, a pleurectomy, unilateral or bilateral, in combination with mechanical pleurodesis and thoracic duct ligation is performed for SCC, and we describe our approach and outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed over 15-year period neonatal patients with SCC managed surgically with pleurectomy after medical therapy was unsuccessful. Patients were divided into two groups: those who underwent pleurectomy within 28 d of diagnosis (early group) and those who underwent pleurectomy after 28 d (late group). Resolution of chylothorax was defined by the absence of clinical symptoms as well as absent or minimal pleural effusion on chest X-ray. RESULTS: Of 40 patients diagnosed with SCC over the study period, 15 underwent pleurectomy, eight early [mean time to operation = 20 (IQR 17, 23) d] and 7 late [59 (42, 75) d, P = 0.001]. Overall survival was 67% (10 of 15). Seven of 8 (88%) neonates who underwent early pleurectomy survived versus 3 of 7 (43%) who underwent late pleurectomy (P = 0.07). Length of stay was lower in the early group than the late group [73 (57, 79) versus 102 (109, 213) d, P = 0.05]. All patients who survived to discharge had resolution of their chylothorax. CONCLUSIONS: Pleurectomy with mechanical pleurodesis and thoracic duct ligation is effective in the management of severe congenital chylothorax. When performed earlier, pleurectomy for severe congenital chylothorax may be associated with improved survival and shorter hospital length of stay.",

Cervical masses were detected by ultrasound late in the third trimester. Following interdisciplinary case conferences, a caesarean section in the presence of a neonatal team was the chosen delivery mode in both cases. Delivery and transition of the newborns were uneventful. The suspected diagnosis was confirmed by postnatal MRIs, which demonstrated neither associated malformations nor compression of vital structures. Therefore, an expectant approach was chosen for the newborn with the smaller lesion. The other newborn featured a sizeable lymphatic malformation, and due to consecutive head tilt, sclerotherapy was initiated in its second week of life. Our case report outlines the challenges of a rare connatal malformation. Guidelines are often missing. Individual decisions regarding delivery mode, diagnostics and therapy have to be made on an interdisciplinary basis and patients as well as parents need counseling and support over a long period. All the more significant is good, interdisciplinary collaboration between the involved disciplines.",

Unlike previous studies, this series includes pediatric and adult patients, highlights a single stage partial excision of a complex venous malformation, and describes the first description of using glue prior to resection of a macrocystic lymphatic malformation. STUDY DESIGN: Case series with chart review. SETTING: Tertiary-care adult and pediatric hospital. SUBJECTS AND RESULTS: Four patients (3 males - 9, 13, 25 years, 1 female - 61 years) underwent same day excision of head and neck vascular malformations utilizing immediate preoperative n-BCA glue embolization performed by interventional radiology and otolaryngology, as described by Tieu et al. The indications for resection included bleeding (1/4), pain (3/4), cosmetic deformity (3/4), and discomfort with denture wear (1/4). Prior interventions included none (1/4), cautery and primary closure to control acute hemorrhage (1/4), and sclerotherapy (2/4). Treatments included complete embolization and resection of simple venous malformation (VM)s of the oral cavity/lip (2/4), partial embolization and resection of a complex hemifacial venous malformation (VM) (1/4), and complete embolization and resection of a lymphatic malformation (LM) (1/4). On average, 97 min of anesthesia time was added for the preoperative embolization procedure (range, 94-104 min). All patients had a successful embolization without need for coils. Operative time ranged from 28 to 44 min for the simple cases and was 6 h and 30 min for the complex case. There was minimal blood loss in all cases. There were no associated complications, lesion recurrences, or long-term deficits at an average follow-up of 5 months. The patient with the complex hemifacial VM demonstrated subtle lower facial weakness post-operatively, which completely resolved within two months. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of head and neck vascular malformations with preoperative n-BCA glue and subsequent surgical excision is a viable method for both simple and complex lesions. The safety and efficacy of this technique has been demonstrated in the past in a limited number of studies. This study further supports the use of this technique to address patient concerns such as pain or discomfort and cosmetic deformity, even if the lesion is only partially resectable. In our series a lymphatic malformation refractory to sclerotherapy was treated with a similar technique of glue and resection, following aspiration of the mucoid LM fluid. Our series emphasizes that pediatric vascular malformations carry functional and cosmetic deficits into adulthood that can and should be addressed in this patient population. Therefore, same-day embolization and resection should be coordinated when possible, in order to optimize patient safety and convenience.",

Data on intralymphatic iodine exposure, risk factors for disease severity, and timing of hypothyroidism are limited. Case Descriptions: We report 4 cases of premature neonates with previously normal thyroid function tests (TFTs) who developed hypothyroidism after intralymphatic iodinated contrast. Patients 1 and 2, premature infants with complex medical histories, had chylous effusions and high-volume chest tube output requiring imaging with lymphangiograms on day of life (DOL) 97 and DOL 43, respectively. They developed severe, primary hypothyroidism with TSH of 335.7 mIU/mL (reference range, 1.7 to 9.1) on DOL 111 and TSH of 470.2 mIU/mL (reference range, 1.7 to 9.1) on DOL 68. Patient 3 had prenatally diagnosed fetal hydrops manifesting with chylous effusions and high-volume chest tube output. The infant underwent lymphangiography on DOL 90 and was noted to have an elevated TSH of 13.35 mIU/mL (reference range, 1.7 to 9.1) 4 days later with spot urine iodine of 1742 microg/L (normal, <200). Patient 4 had a lymphatic malformation and underwent sclerotherapy with doxycycline with intralymphatic iodine exposure on DOL 4 and was found to have a TSH of 16.7 microU/mL (reference range, 1.7 to 9.1) 3 days later with spot urine iodine of 228,712 microg/L (normal, <200). The TFT results for all patients improved after levothyroxine administration. Conclusion: Intralymphatic iodine should be considered a major risk factor in the development of iatrogenic primary hypothyroidism, especially in premature neonates soon after exposure. Close monitoring of TFTs is imperative to avoid potential long-term adverse outcomes in this population.",

METHODS: Medical records of patients who were treated for LM in the Paediatric Surgical Centre Universitas Gadjah Mada from January 2015 to January 2019 were reviewed. Scoring systems were used to assess the outcomes, including reduction of size, problems of aesthetics, functional problems, complications, necessity of further interventions, and interventions' frequencies. RESULTS: During the four-year study, we included 31 children, consisting of 6, 5, and 20 patients in Groups I, II, and III, respectively. The total score did not significantly differ between Groups I, II, and III (14.67+-2.80 vs. 13.40+-2.07 vs. 12.50+-1.47, respectively; p=0.056). Group II scored better in aesthetic problems than other groups (p=0.001), Group III scored higher in necessity of further interventions compared to the other groups (p=0.026), and Group I was higher in interventions' frequencies than the other groups (p<0.001). However, there were no significant differences in reduction of size, functional problems, and complications among groups (p=0.554, 0.151, and 0.076, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: There is no significant different effect of the three modalities treatment for LM, although one group might have more beneficial effects compared with the other groups due to different scoring system parameters. Further multicentre and prospective cohort studies with a larger number of patients are necessary to establish the existence and extent of our findings.",

The total score did not significantly differ between Groups I, II, and III (14.67+-2.80 vs. 13.40+-2.07 vs. 12.50+-1.47, respectively; p=0.056). Group II scored better in aesthetic problems than other groups (p=0.001), Group III scored higher in necessity of further interventions compared to the other groups (p=0.026), and Group I was higher in interventions' frequencies than the other groups (p<0.001). However, there were no significant differences in reduction of size, functional problems, and complications among groups (p=0.554, 0.151, and 0.076, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: There is no significant different effect of the three modalities treatment for LM, although one group might have more beneficial effects compared with the other groups due to different scoring system parameters. Further multicentre and prospective cohort studies with a larger number of patients are necessary to establish the existence and extent of our findings.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To systematically review current literature on the treatment of lymphatic malformations (LMs) of the head and neck to guide treatment strategy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of literature until 16 November 2021 was performed on treatments of LMs in the head and neck. RESULTS: Out of 9044 articles, 54 studies were eligible for inclusion with 26 studies providing detailed participant data. A total number of 1573 patients with a mean age of 21.22 months were analysed. Comparative meta-analysis did not reveal significant differences two proportions of volume reduction (>= 50% and 100%) between sclerotherapy and surgical treatment. Regression demonstrated that positive predictors for volume reduction were surgery 17 (95% CI 0.26-34; p = 0.047) and treatment of macrocystic lesions 19 (95% CI 5.5-32; p = 0.006). Treatment of mixed lesions also demonstrated a trend towards achieving a greater volume reduction (p = 0.052). A higher de Serres stage of the lesion had a negative effect on the amount of volume reduction - 3.7 (95% CI - 7.0 to - 0.35; p = 0.030). CONCLUSION: This comprehensive meta-analysis demonstrated no significant difference in volume reduction between various treatment modalities at study level. However, individual patient data indicated that surgery and larger cyst types are associated with a significant higher percentage of volume reduction, whereas a higher de Serres stage negatively impacted the amount of volume reduction. These findings can be used for patient counseling and treatment planning based on cyst type and de Serres stage. However volume reduction constitutes just one objective within a more complex treatment spectrum.",

                    "abstract": "Lymphatic malformations (LMs) are developmental defects of lymphatic vessels. LMs are histologically benign lesions, however, due to localization, size, and unexpected swelling, they may cause serious complications that threaten vital functions such as compression of the airways. A large swelling of the face or neck may also be disfiguring and thus constitute a psychological strain for patients and their families. LMs are also highly immunologically reactive, and are prone to recurrent infections and inflammation causing pain as well as chronic oozing wounds. The European Reference Network on Rare Multisystemic Vascular Diseases (VASCERN) is dedicated to gathering the best expertise in Europe. There are only few available guidelines on management and follow up of LMs, which commonly focus on very specific situations, such as head and neck LM (Zhou et al., 2011). It is still unclear, what constitutes an indication for treatment of LMs and how to follow up the patients. The Vascular Anomalies Working Group (VASCA-WG) of VASCERN decided to develop a diagnostic and management pathway for the management of LMs with a Nominal Group Technique (NGT), a well-established, structured, multistep, facilitated group meeting technique used to generate consensus statements. The pathway was drawn following 2 face-to-face meetings and multiple web meetings to facilitate discussion, and by mail to avoid the influence of most authoritative members. The VASCA-WG has produced this opinion statement reflecting strategies developed by experts and patient representatives on how to approach patients with lymphatic malformations in a practical manner; we present an algorithmic view of the results of our work.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lymphatic malformations (LM) are rare congenital lesions with varied clinical presentations, from asymptomatic to life-threatening. Regardless of initial presentation, many are treated aggressively either surgically or medically. There is a scarcity of literature regarding expectant management, this study compares current literature surrounding the outcomes of LMs managed conservatively to a provincial database in which conservative management was the primary treatment. METHODS: Retrospective chart review of all pediatric patients diagnosed with a lymphatic malformation in Newfoundland and Labrador between 1989-2019. In total, 43 patients were reviewed, 2 were excluded due to inadequate follow up, 1 was excluded due to initial life-threatening presentation requiring intervention. Of these patients, 32 were managed conservatively without any intervention, 7 surgically, and 1 aspirated. Data extracted included age at referral, management, complications, clinical regression and patient satisfaction, years of follow up, and recurrence rate. RESULTS: Patients managed expectantly had partial or complete clinical regression in 81%. Anecdotal regression as reported by patients and family was 84%. This is compared to a 45% clinical regression with expectant management in the literature and a recent systematic review with a 48% overall regression rate with sclerotherapy [10,12]. Average follow up was 6 years and average time to regression was 6.6 years. No major complications were reported. Recurrence rate in expectant management was 0% versus 21% in surgical group. CONCLUSIONS: Expectant management is a safe and viable alternative to more aggressive treatments and ultimately leads to regression in the majority of cases. It should be considered as first line for non-life-threatening lymphatic malformations.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Lymphatic malformations (LM) are congenital malformations of the lymphatic system, mainly located in the head and neck area. They can be staged based on location according to de Serres and based on different morbidity items using the Cologne Disease Score (CDS), a clinical staging system. In many cases, functional impairment greatly affects the life of patients suffering from lymphatic malformations. The present study aims to analyze a cohort of pediatric patients with LM. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 144 pediatric patients with head and neck LM was performed. Location, type of malformation (microcystic, macrocystic, mixed), scoring according to two different scoring systems and therapy were analyzed. Kruskal-Wallis test was used to analyze the difference in CDS between the patient groups and Dunn's test was used for post-hoc pairwise comparison. RESULTS: The average age at presentation was 6.1 years. The most common sites were neck (47%), cheek/parotid gland (26%), tongue (17%) and orbit (8%). Macrocystic malformations dominated the lateral neck, while microcystic malformations were predominantly localized in the tongue and floor of mouth. Macrocystic malformations (mean CDS 9.44) were associated with significantly better CDS than microcystic (mean CDS 7.11) and mixed (mean CDS 5.71) malformations (p < 0.001). LM in stage V according to de Serres had the lowest values (mean CDS: 4.26). The most common therapeutic procedures were conventional surgical (partial) resection, laser therapy and sclerotherapy with OK-432. CONCLUSIONS: There is an association between malformation type, location according to de Serres and CDS in children with LM of the head and neck. Patients with microcystic and mixed malformations in stage V had lowest CDS levels.",

METHODS: A retrospective analysis of a lymphatic malformation data base was performed. Patients with superficial lymphatic malformation treated by curettage and sclerotherapy technique with bleomycin were included in this study. Safety and efficacy of the curettage and sclerotherapy technique with bleomycin were evaluated. RESULTS: Between September 2019 and October 2021, 10 consecutive patients (male/female ratio: 4:6; mean age, 10.9 years; range, 3-35 years) presented with superficial lymphatic malformations that were subsequently treated by curettage and sclerotherapy technique with bleomycin. All lesions were located on the trunk and extremities. Each patient received one treatment session and a mean follow-up of 12 months. We observed minor complications. No postoperative infections occurred in this series. No patient developed skin ulceration or necrosis. Scarring and recurrence occurred in one patient. Complete regression was confirmed for all 10 patients by photographic evaluation. CONCLUSION: A curettage and sclerotherapy technique is proposed to treat superficial lymphatic malformation in this study. This technique seems to be safe and highly effective.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To report an innovative endoscopic surgery for subcutaneous vascular malformations and intramuscular FAVA at our center. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Historically, open surgical resection has been the treatment of choice. Recent advances in minimal invasive surgery have led to the successful application of endoscopic resection techniques for the surgical management of diseases of the soft tissue. METHODS: Patients who underwent endoscopic resection of vascular anomalies were included in this retrospective review. Data was extracted from our Vascular Anomalies Center database between September 2019 and October 2022, including sex, age, symptoms, diagnosis, sites of surgery, previous treatment, surgery, and follow-up. RESULTS: There were 13 female and 15 males in the current study, age ranging from 1 to 17 years. The diagnoses included microcystic lymphatic malformation (n=8), Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (n=7), venous malformation (n=6), FAVA (n=6), and mixed cystic lymphatic malformation (n=1). Surgical sites included the lower extremity (n=24), abdominal wall (n=2), the upper extremity (n=1), and thoracic wall (n=1). Five patients had an intramuscular lesion (FAVA). Endoscopic technique used 2 or 3 small ports in a gas inflation fashion. Surgery included thrombectomy, radical resection and debulking of vascular anomalies. Postoperative sclerotherapy with bleomycin was performed via drainage tube in 6 patients with microcystic LM. Technical success was obtained in 27 patients. The conversion to open surgery was performed in one patient owing to the deep location of lesion. No wound-related complication was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic surgery is a minimal invasive, effective, and safe treatment for subcutaneous vascular malformations and intramuscular FAVA. This approach can set a new standard that minimizes wound complications and reduces recovery time in patients undergoing resection for benign soft-tissue lesions.",

We describe the unique clinical course, diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes of patients with cervical lymphatic malformation (CLM) managed with EXIT. METHODS: Review of fetuses with diagnosed CLM was delivered by EXIT (2001-2018) in a tertiary referral fetal center. Outcomes included survival, tracheostomy at discharge, neonatal course after delivery, and pulmonary hypoplasia. Data are reported as median [range] and rate (%). RESULTS: Out of 45 patients delivered by EXIT, 10 were delivered for CLM: seven had polyhydramnios, one had nonimmune hydrops, five delivered preterm, and three were emergency EXITs. The EXIT time and estimated blood loss were 125 minutes (95, 158) and 900 mL (500, 1500), respectively. Airway was secured in all. There was one neonatal death (day 8) with prematurity, sepsis, and pulmonary hypoplasia. Three out of nine were discharged with a tracheostomy. CONCLUSION: In CLM, close monitoring for structural neck involvement and development of polyhydramnios are important and may be an indication for EXIT as the optimal delivery mode. An experienced multidisciplinary team is a key factor for an effective approach to the obstructed airway in CLM.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Patients born with bilateral head and neck lymphatic malformations (BHNLMs) often require multiple invasive treatments, including tracheostomy. We hypothesized that primary targeted medical therapy (pTMT) with diagnostic needle aspiration reduces the need for invasive therapy such as surgical resection and/or sclerotherapy. METHODS: Retrospective case review was performed of infants with BHNLMs (Grade 2 or De Serres stage IV and V) treated only at our institution from 2000 to 2021. Patients were divided into two cohorts: those managed with pTMT and those managed with observation, sclerotherapy, or surgical intervention (non-pTMT). Data regarding interventions, clinical outcomes, morbidity, and mortality were analyzed with descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Nine children with BHNLMs met inclusion criteria. Three (33%) were in the pTMT cohort and six (66%) were non-pTMT. Eight (89%) malformations were genotyped, and all demonstrated hotspot PIK3CA variants. All pTMT patients had sirolimus initiated in the first month of life and underwent needle aspiration of malformation cyst fluid for cell-free DNA samples. All pTMT patients tolerated medical therapy. For the non-pTMT cohort, primary treatment included none (deceased, n = 1, 17%), observation with needle aspiration (n = 1, 17%), surgical resection (n = 2, 33%), or combination surgery and sclerotherapy (n = 2, 33%). Intubation duration, intensive care and initial hospital length of stay were not different between cohorts. Four non-pTMT patients (67%) required tracheostomy, and two (33%) died prior to discharge. All pTMT patients survived and none required tracheostomy. Non-pTMT patients required a median of two invasive therapies prior to discharge (IQR 1-4) and a mean total of 13 over the course of their lifetime (IQR 1-16), compared to the pTMT group who did not require any lifetime invasive therapy, even after initial pTMT and discharge home. CONCLUSION: This study compares patients with BHNLMs (Grade 2) treated with pTMT versus those treated with observation or invasive therapy. Patients treated with pTMT required no surgical or invasive procedural treatment of their malformations, no tracheostomy placement, no unplanned readmissions after discharge, and had no mortalities. Needle aspiration was useful as a therapeutic adjunct for cell-free DNA diagnosis of PIK3CA variants, which guided TMT.",

Microcystic LM within the vagina and pelvis is not easily visible, and there are many side effects of treatment. Lymphangiography, a relatively old method of identifying diseases of the lymphatic system, has been rarely used in clinical settings because of the difficulty of performing this test. In this article, we describe the use of a special lesion site adjacent to the nearby lymph nodes for the treatment of vaginal and pelvic microcystic LM. CASE: Lymphangiography was performed using lymph node aspiration combined with direct local puncture of the lesion, guided by the injection of iodine oil, which can produce a better outcome and more complete removal of the lesion. Finally, sclerotherapy was conducted using a low concentration of 50% ethanol with good fluidity, which covered the lesion to a great extent. This methodology was shown to be effective in treating children with vaginal and pelvic microcystic LM.",

The most common cause is the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak within the spinal canal. Although previously reported in only a few cases, also paraspinal lymphatic malformations causing vertebral bone destruction may occasionally result in CSF leak to these pathological formations. Here, we present a case of a 9-year-old girl with generalized lymphatic anomaly (GLA) presenting with severe postural headache. Radiological imaging revealed a typical feature of cerebellar sagging. Myelography localized the CSF leakage into vertebral bodies of C7 and Th1, which both were partly involved in pathological paravertebral masses of known lymphatic anomaly, and from there along the right C8 nerve root sleeve into the anomaly. As the C8-nerve root could not be ligated due to the risk of significant neurological injury, we attempted image-guided targeted percutaneous epidural placement of a blood patch directly into the foramen at the affected level. The procedure resulted in obliteration of the fistula and regression of cerebellar sagging, with significant relief of symptoms. Although it is an extremely rare coincidence, patients with paraspinal lymphatic malformations may develop intraspinal CSF leak into these pathological formations. The present case report suggests that besides a direct surgical obliteration of the fistula and sacrificing the nerve root, a targeted percutaneous epidural blood patch may be a possible alternative in the case of a functionally important nerve root.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To report an innovative endoscopic surgery for subcutaneous vascular malformations and intramuscular FAVA at our center. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Historically, open surgical resection has been the treatment of choice. Recent advances in minimal invasive surgery have led to the successful application of endoscopic resection techniques for the surgical management of diseases of the soft tissue. METHODS: Patients who underwent endoscopic resection of vascular anomalies were included in this retrospective review. Data was extracted from our Vascular Anomalies Center database between September 2019 and October 2022, including sex, age, symptoms, diagnosis, sites of surgery, previous treatment, surgery, and follow-up. RESULTS: There were 13 female and 15 males in the current study, age ranging from 1 to 17 years. The diagnoses included microcystic lymphatic malformation (n=8), Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (n=7), venous malformation (n=6), FAVA (n=6), and mixed cystic lymphatic malformation (n=1). Surgical sites included the lower extremity (n=24), abdominal wall (n=2), the upper extremity (n=1), and thoracic wall (n=1). Five patients had an intramuscular lesion (FAVA). Endoscopic technique used 2 or 3 small ports in a gas inflation fashion. Surgery included thrombectomy, radical resection and debulking of vascular anomalies. Postoperative sclerotherapy with bleomycin was performed via drainage tube in 6 patients with microcystic LM. Technical success was obtained in 27 patients. The conversion to open surgery was performed in one patient owing to the deep location of lesion. No wound-related complication was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic surgery is a minimal invasive, effective, and safe treatment for subcutaneous vascular malformations and intramuscular FAVA. This approach can set a new standard that minimizes wound complications and reduces recovery time in patients undergoing resection for benign soft-tissue lesions.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To report an innovative endoscopic surgery for subcutaneous vascular malformations and intramuscular FAVA at our center. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Historically, open surgical resection has been the treatment of choice. Recent advances in minimal invasive surgery have led to the successful application of endoscopic resection techniques for the surgical management of diseases of the soft tissue. METHODS: Patients who underwent endoscopic resection of vascular anomalies were included in this retrospective review. Data was extracted from our Vascular Anomalies Center database between September 2019 and October 2022, including sex, age, symptoms, diagnosis, sites of surgery, previous treatment, surgery, and follow-up. RESULTS: There were 13 female and 15 males in the current study, age ranging from 1 to 17 years. The diagnoses included microcystic lymphatic malformation (n=8), Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (n=7), venous malformation (n=6), FAVA (n=6), and mixed cystic lymphatic malformation (n=1). Surgical sites included the lower extremity (n=24), abdominal wall (n=2), the upper extremity (n=1), and thoracic wall (n=1). Five patients had an intramuscular lesion (FAVA). Endoscopic technique used 2 or 3 small ports in a gas inflation fashion. Surgery included thrombectomy, radical resection and debulking of vascular anomalies. Postoperative sclerotherapy with bleomycin was performed via drainage tube in 6 patients with microcystic LM. Technical success was obtained in 27 patients. The conversion to open surgery was performed in one patient owing to the deep location of lesion. No wound-related complication was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic surgery is a minimal invasive, effective, and safe treatment for subcutaneous vascular malformations and intramuscular FAVA. This approach can set a new standard that minimizes wound complications and reduces recovery time in patients undergoing resection for benign soft-tissue lesions.",

Sirolimus, effectively inhibiting endothelial cell proliferation in lymphatic vessels, plays a crucial role in iLM treatment. However, the drug's narrow therapeutic window and substantial interindividual variability necessitate customized dosing strategies. This study aims to establish a Population Pharmacokinetic Model (PopPK model) for sirolimus in pediatric iLM patients, identifying quantitative relationships between covariates and sirolimus clearance and volume of distribution. Initial dosages are recommended based on a target concentration range of 5-15 ng/mL. Retrospective data from our institution, encompassing 53 pediatric patients with 275 blood concentration results over the past five years (average age: 4.64 +- 4.19 years), constituted the foundation of this analysis. The final model, adopting a first-order absorption and elimination single-compartment model, retained age as the sole covariate. Results indicated a robust correlation between apparent clearance (CL/F) at 5.56 L/h, apparent volume of distribution (V/F) at 292.57 L, and age. Monte Carlo simulation guided initial dosages for patients aged 0-18 years within the target concentration range. This study presents the first PopPK model using a large Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) database to describe personalized sirolimus dosing for pediatric iLM patients, contributing to pharmacokinetic guidance and potentially improving long-term clinical outcomes.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lymphatic vascular malformations are rare findings in canine patients with six reports available in veterinary literature. Retroperitoneal cystic lymphatic malformations have not been described previously in canine patients and neither has the use of immunohistochemistry to determine their origin, i.e. vascular versus lymphatic. CASE PRESENTATION: An 8-year-old neutered female Cocker spaniel was referred for pollakiuria, dysuria and a painful abdomen. Computed tomography scanning of the abdomen showed a fluid filled structure adjacent to the urinary bladder. During surgical exploration, a thin walled cystic structure with sero-haemorrhagic fluid was found, extending from the retroperitoneal space into the abdomen. The mass was excised and submitted for histopathology, revealing a cystic mass lined by a fibrovascular capsule within the retroperitoneal/mesenteric adipose tissue. The inner surface of the cyst was lined by a single layer of bland, flattened spindle cells. Intramural blood vessels were well differentiated, with perivascular haemorrhage. On recurrence 11 months later, the mass was excised for the second time and a PleuralPort (Norfolk Animal products) was placed. Fifteen months after initial presentation, progression occurred with haemorrhagic fluid in the cystic space, pleural- and abdominal cavities and the owners opted for euthanasia. Histopathology and positive immunohistochemistry for lymphatic markers lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronic acid receptor-1 (LYVE-1) and prospero homeobox protein-1 (PROX-1) confirmed a lymphatic vascular origin of the cystic structure. CONCLUSIONS: To our experience, a definitive diagnosis of retroperitoneal cystic malformation of lymphatic origin could be done only by combining the clinical presentation, advanced imaging, histopathology and LYVE-1 and PROX-1 immunohistochemistry. This is the first report of a vascular malformation in a dog where immunohistochemistry was used to make a final diagnosis. A lymphatic malformation, even if rare, should be added on the list of the differential diagnosis in a patient with a retroperitoneal cystic structure containing serohaemorrhagic fluid. Results of this case report can aid in diagnosis of future cases, however, further studies on therapy and management are needed to provide additional information about optimal treatment of these patients.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Detection of fetal airway compromise through imaging raises the possible need for ex utero intrapartum treatment (EXIT) procedures. Despite EXIT procedures involving massive resource utilization and posing increased risk to the mother, decisions for EXIT are usually based on anecdotal experience. Our objectives were to analyze prenatal consultations with potential fetal airway obstruction for imaging and obstetric findings used to determine management strategy. METHODS: Retrospective chart review was performed for prenatal abnormal fetal airway consults between 2004-2019 at a quaternary pediatric facility. Data collected included demographics, imaging characteristics, delivery information, and airway management. Our primary outcome was EXIT performance and the secondary outcome was postnatal airway management. Fisher's exact test was used to compare management decisions, outcomes, and imaging findings. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients met inclusion criteria. The most common diagnoses observed were lymphatic malformation, teratoma, and micrognathia. Of the imaging findings collected, only midline neck mass location was associated with EXIT procedure performance. Factors associated with invasive airway support at birth were mass-induced in-utero neck extension and neck vessel compression, polyhydramnios, and micrognathia. CONCLUSIONS: Multidisciplinary input and interpretation of prenatal imaging can guide management of fetal airway-related pathology. EXIT is an overall safe procedure and can decrease risk due to airway obstruction at birth. We identified in-utero neck extension, neck vessel compression, micrognathia, and polyhydramnios as better indicators of a need for invasive airways measures at birth and suggest use of these criteria in combination with clinical judgement when recommending EXIT.

We describe the unique clinical course, diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes of patients with cervical lymphatic malformation (CLM) managed with EXIT. METHODS: Review of fetuses with diagnosed CLM was delivered by EXIT (2001-2018) in a tertiary referral fetal center. Outcomes included survival, tracheostomy at discharge, neonatal course after delivery, and pulmonary hypoplasia. Data are reported as median [range] and rate (%). RESULTS: Out of 45 patients delivered by EXIT, 10 were delivered for CLM: seven had polyhydramnios, one had nonimmune hydrops, five delivered preterm, and three were emergency EXITs. The EXIT time and estimated blood loss were 125 minutes (95, 158) and 900 mL (500, 1500), respectively. Airway was secured in all. There was one neonatal death (day 8) with prematurity, sepsis, and pulmonary hypoplasia. Three out of nine were discharged with a tracheostomy. CONCLUSION: In CLM, close monitoring for structural neck involvement and development of polyhydramnios are important and may be an indication for EXIT as the optimal delivery mode. An experienced multidisciplinary team is a key factor for an effective approach to the obstructed airway in CLM.",

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all fetuses who underwent EXIT procedures between 2003 and 2018. RESULTS: EXIT procedures were performed in nine cases. The prenatal diagnosis of the neonates was congenital high airway obstruction syndrome in four cases, the neck masse in five cases. Although the airway management under the EXIT procedure was successful in eight cases, the airway management failed in one case. During the EXIT procedures, the airway was managed by endotracheal intubation in two cases, whereas six cases underwent tracheostomy. Six cases with fetal airway obstruction survived to discharge, whereas three cases died due to airway management failure or complications of the underlying disease. A case with a cervical teratoma underwent tumor resection the day after birth due to rapid enlargement of the neck mass. Long-term survival was achieved in five cases. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that the EXIT procedure was effective and could be performed safely in the airway management of fetuses with suspected airway obstruction. The treatment strategy for the neck masses should be planned before birth.",

METHODS: A retrospective case series was conducted of ten patients treated between January 2011 and July 2019. The main outcome measures included airway compromise and clinical response to sclerotherapy +- surgery. Categorical data were compared using the Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: Ex-utero intrapartum therapy was performed in four cases, among whom one died due to sepsis. All patients underwent schlerotherapy, with surgical debulking in two. Four patients showed a good clinical response, and five started experimental systemic treatment. Patients with bilateral disease and patients with an LM with >180  tracheal surrounding were significantly at risk for airway compromise (bilateral: n = 6/6 versus n = 0/4, p = 0.005; >180 : n = 5/5 versus n = 1/5, p = 0.048). The need for LM treatment in the neonatal period was indicative of a poor clinical response ('non-responders' 5/6, 'responders' 0/4; p = 0.048). CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that bilateral disease and >180  tracheal surrounding are risk factors for airway compromise in neonates with an LM adjacent to the airway. In addition, the need for early treatment seems to be indicative of a poor clinical response.",

Prenatal diagnosis facilitates safe delivery with pre- and perinatal airway assessment and management and Ex-Utero-Intrapartum-Treatment (EXIT) if necessary. Fetoscopic airway evaluation can optimize the selection of patients in need of an EXIT procedure. METHODS: Description of 11 consecutive fetuses, born with a potential airway obstruction between 1999 and 2011 and treated at the University Hospitals Leuven, with a long-term follow-up until 2018. An algorithm including fetoscopic airway evaluation is presented. RESULTS: In utero imaging revealed seven teratomas, one fourth branchial pouch cyst, one thymopharyngeal duct remnant, one lymphatic malformation and one laryngeal atresia. A multidisciplinary team could avoid EXIT in eight patients by ultrasonographic (n = 2) or fetoscopic (n = 6) documentation of accessible airways. Three patients needed an EXIT-to-airway-procedure. Neonatal surgery included tracheostomy during EXIT (n = 2) and resection of teratoma (n = 7) or branchiogenic pathology (n = 3). All patients do well at long-term (minimum 54 months) follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Combining prenatal imaging and perinatal fetoscopy, EXIT-procedure and neonatal surgery yields an optimal long-term outcome in these complex patients. Fetoscopy can dramatically reduce the number of EXIT-procedures.",

Logically reducing HNLM ITs should reduce treatment risk. We tested whether delaying HNLM ITs reduces total IT number. MATERIALS: Consecutive HNLM patients (n = 199) between 2010 and 2017, aged 0-18 years. METHODS: ITs (surgery or sclerotherapy) were offered for persistent or dysfunction causing HNLMs. Treatment effectiveness categorized by IT number: optimal (0-1), acceptable (2-5), or suboptimal (>5). Clinical data were summarized, and outcome associations tested (chi2 ). Relative risk (RR) with a Poisson working model tested whether HNLM observation or IT delay (>6 months post-diagnosis) predicts treatment success (i.e., <=1 IT). RESULTS: Median age at HNLM diagnosis was 1.3 months (interquartile range [IQR] 0-45 m) with 107/199(54%) male. HNLM were stage I-III (174 [88%]), IV-V (25 [13%]). Initial treatment was observation (70 [35%]), invasive (129 [65%]). Treatment outcomes were optimal (137 [69%]), acceptable (36 [18%]), and suboptimal (26 [13%]). Suboptimal outcome associations: EXIT procedure, stage IV-V, oral location, and tracheotomy (p < 0.001). Stage I-III HNLMs were initially observed compared with stage I-III having ITs within 6 months of HNLM diagnosis, had a 82% lower relative treatment failure risk ([i.e., >1 IT], RR = 0.09, 95% CI 0.02-0.36, p < 0.001). Stage I-III HNLMs with non-delayed ITs had reduced treatment failure risk compared with IV-V (RR = 0.47, 95% CI 0.33-0.66, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Observation and delayed IT in stage I-III HNLM (\"Grade 1\") is safe and reduces IT (i.e., <=1 IT). Stage IV-V HNLMs (\"Grade 2\") with early IT have a greater risk of multiple ITs.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Large fetal head and neck (HN) masses can be life-threatening at birth and postnatally owing to airway obstruction. The two most frequent congenital masses that may obstruct the airway are lymphatic malformation (LM) and teratoma. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the results of our experience in the management of giant congenital HN masses and to conduct a literature review. METHODS: The study involved a consecutive series of 13 newborns (7 females) affected by giant HN masses. Prenatal diagnosis was achieved by means of ultrasound (US) and fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Delivery was performed by means of EXIT procedure in case of radiological evidence of airway obstruction. In the postnatal period all feasible therapeutic options (surgery, sclerotherapy, medical therapy) were discussed and adopted by a multidisciplinary team. Twelve patients underwent surgery and one received Rapamycin for one month, with consequent surgical resection owing to increasing size of the mass. RESULTS: The histopathological diagnosis was LM in 11 cases and teratoma in 2 cases. Airway obstruction was solved in 11 cases; 2 LM patients required a tracheotomy because of persistent airway obstruction. Major complications were flap necrosis (one patient) and facial nerve palsy (2 cases). Recurrence occurred in 5 patients. CONCLUSIONS: The management of congenital HN masses is always challenging and necessarily requires an interdisciplinary approach. Current therapeutic options include surgery, sclerotherapy, medical therapy or a combination of them. When they are large enough to obstruct the airway, a patient-centered approach should guide timing and modality of treatment. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV.",

Cervical masses were detected by ultrasound late in the third trimester. Following interdisciplinary case conferences, a caesarean section in the presence of a neonatal team was the chosen delivery mode in both cases. Delivery and transition of the newborns were uneventful. The suspected diagnosis was confirmed by postnatal MRIs, which demonstrated neither associated malformations nor compression of vital structures. Therefore, an expectant approach was chosen for the newborn with the smaller lesion. The other newborn featured a sizeable lymphatic malformation, and due to consecutive head tilt, sclerotherapy was initiated in its second week of life. Our case report outlines the challenges of a rare connatal malformation. Guidelines are often missing. Individual decisions regarding delivery mode, diagnostics and therapy have to be made on an interdisciplinary basis and patients as well as parents need counseling and support over a long period.

This study aims to describe the long-term outcomes of current management strategies for patients with simple (cystic) LMs. METHODS: The case records of all patients (age <=16 years) with simple (cystic) LMs at our tertiary institution between 2008 and 2019 were assessed for clinical features, imaging and details of management, including complications. RESULTS: Of a total of 164 patients (60% male), 66% were diagnosed aged <2 years. The median follow-up was 5 (0.3-16) years from diagnosis. LMs were located in the head and neck (40%), extremities (27%), trunk (23%), mediastinum (4%), or intra-abdominally (6%). Types were macrocystic in 47%, microcystic in 21% and mixed in 32%. Sclerotherapy was the most common intervention (38%). Primary surgery had been performed in 12%. Symptomatic improvement, reduction in size, or complete regression were observed in 82/102 (80%) of LMs after interventions; complications from treatment were uncommon (Clavien-Dindo grade I-II: 6%; grade III-IIId: 1%). Sixty-two patients (38%; median age 0.5 (range, 0-12) years) had not required interventions to date; spontaneous regression of the LM occurred in 16 (26%) of these expectantly followed-up cases. CONCLUSIONS: Most studies to date have focused on LMs in selected anatomical locations. Herein the outcomes of an entire population from a single tertiary unit of patients are presented, demonstrating the wide heterogeneity of simple (cystic) LMs and highlighting the importance of individualized, multidisciplinary approaches to care in achieving optimal outcomes.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lymphatic malformations (LM) are rare congenital lesions with varied clinical presentations, from asymptomatic to life-threatening. Regardless of initial presentation, many are treated aggressively either surgically or medically. There is a scarcity of literature regarding expectant management, this study compares current literature surrounding the outcomes of LMs managed conservatively to a provincial database in which conservative management was the primary treatment. METHODS: Retrospective chart review of all pediatric patients diagnosed with a lymphatic malformation in Newfoundland and Labrador between 1989-2019. In total, 43 patients were reviewed, 2 were excluded due to inadequate follow up, 1 was excluded due to initial life-threatening presentation requiring intervention. Of these patients, 32 were managed conservatively without any intervention, 7 surgically, and 1 aspirated. Data extracted included age at referral, management, complications, clinical regression and patient satisfaction, years of follow up, and recurrence rate. RESULTS: Patients managed expectantly had partial or complete clinical regression in 81%. Anecdotal regression as reported by patients and family was 84%. This is compared to a 45% clinical regression with expectant management in the literature and a recent systematic review with a 48% overall regression rate with sclerotherapy [10,12]. Average follow up was 6 years and average time to regression was 6.6 years. No major complications were reported. Recurrence rate in expectant management was 0% versus 21% in surgical group. CONCLUSIONS: Expectant management is a safe and viable alternative to more aggressive treatments and ultimately leads to regression in the majority of cases. It should be considered as first line for non-life-threatening lymphatic malformations.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: To explore the imaging features, key diagnostic points, classification, treatment, and prognosis of cervical lymphatic malformation. METHODS: Overall, 320 patients diagnosed with cervical lymphatic malformation were retrospectively analysed in our hospital between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2017. Imaging modalities included colour Doppler ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, and contrast-enhanced computed tomography. Cervical lymphatic malformations were classified by cyst diameter. Treatments included interventional therapy, surgery, and expectant treatment. RESULTS: Cervical lymphatic malformation was identified in 320 of 1192 patients with lymphatic malformation. Four were excluded due to misdiagnosis by ultrasonography. Cervical lymphatic malformation was classified as mixed, macrocystic, and microcystic in 184 (57.5%), 117 (36.56%), and 19 (5.94%) patients, respectively. Sixty-four (20%), ten (3.12%), seven (2.19%), and three (0.94%) patients experienced intracystic haemorrhage, infection, concurrent intracystic haemorrhage and infection, and calcification, respectively. Among 260 (81.25%) patients who underwent interventional sclerotherapy, 163 (50.94%) received it once and 96 (30%) received it two or more times. Twenty-eight (8.75%), five (1.56%), and 27 (8.44%) patients underwent surgical resection, interventional sclerotherapy plus surgery, and expectant management, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasonography is useful for diagnosing definite cervical lymphatic malformation. Interventional therapy is the first choice for children with confirmed cervical lymphatic malformation.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To evaluate imaging, treatment, and outcomes in neonates with a lymphatic malformation (LM) adjacent to the airway and to evaluate risk factors that can predict outcome. METHODS: A retrospective case series was conducted of ten patients treated between January 2011 and July 2019. The main outcome measures included airway compromise and clinical response to sclerotherapy +- surgery. Categorical data were compared using the Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: Ex-utero intrapartum therapy was performed in four cases, among whom one died due to sepsis. All patients underwent schlerotherapy, with surgical debulking in two. Four patients showed a good clinical response, and five started experimental systemic treatment. Patients with bilateral disease and patients with an LM with >180  tracheal surrounding were significantly at risk for airway compromise (bilateral: n = 6/6 versus n = 0/4, p = 0.005; >180 : n = 5/5 versus n = 1/5, p = 0.048). The need for LM treatment in the neonatal period was indicative of a poor clinical response ('non-responders' 5/6, 'responders' 0/4; p = 0.048). CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that bilateral disease and >180  tracheal surrounding are risk factors for airway compromise in neonates with an LM adjacent to the airway. In addition, the need for early treatment seems to be indicative of a poor clinical response.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Large fetal head and neck (HN) masses can be life-threatening at birth and postnatally owing to airway obstruction. The two most frequent congenital masses that may obstruct the airway are lymphatic malformation (LM) and teratoma. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the results of our experience in the management of giant congenital HN masses and to conduct a literature review. METHODS: The study involved a consecutive series of 13 newborns (7 females) affected by giant HN masses. Prenatal diagnosis was achieved by means of ultrasound (US) and fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Delivery was performed by means of EXIT procedure in case of radiological evidence of airway obstruction. In the postnatal period all feasible therapeutic options (surgery, sclerotherapy, medical therapy) were discussed and adopted by a multidisciplinary team. Twelve patients underwent surgery and one received Rapamycin for one month, with consequent surgical resection owing to increasing size of the mass. RESULTS: The histopathological diagnosis was LM in 11 cases and teratoma in 2 cases. Airway obstruction was solved in 11 cases; 2 LM patients required a tracheotomy because of persistent airway obstruction. Major complications were flap necrosis (one patient) and facial nerve palsy (2 cases). Recurrence occurred in 5 patients. CONCLUSIONS: The management of congenital HN masses is always challenging and necessarily requires an interdisciplinary approach. Current therapeutic options include surgery, sclerotherapy, medical therapy or a combination of them. When they are large enough to obstruct the airway, a patient-centered approach should guide timing and modality of treatment. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV.",

Prenatal diagnosis facilitates safe delivery with pre- and perinatal airway assessment and management and Ex-Utero-Intrapartum-Treatment (EXIT) if necessary. Fetoscopic airway evaluation can optimize the selection of patients in need of an EXIT procedure. METHODS: Description of 11 consecutive fetuses, born with a potential airway obstruction between 1999 and 2011 and treated at the University Hospitals Leuven, with a long-term follow-up until 2018. An algorithm including fetoscopic airway evaluation is presented. RESULTS: In utero imaging revealed seven teratomas, one fourth branchial pouch cyst, one thymopharyngeal duct remnant, one lymphatic malformation and one laryngeal atresia. A multidisciplinary team could avoid EXIT in eight patients by ultrasonographic (n = 2) or fetoscopic (n = 6) documentation of accessible airways. Three patients needed an EXIT-to-airway-procedure. Neonatal surgery included tracheostomy during EXIT (n = 2) and resection of teratoma (n = 7) or branchiogenic pathology (n = 3). All patients do well at long-term (minimum 54 months) follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Combining prenatal imaging and perinatal fetoscopy, EXIT-procedure and neonatal surgery yields an optimal long-term outcome in these complex patients. Fetoscopy can dramatically reduce the number of EXIT-procedures.",

A review of the literature reveals this to be a rare complication of sclerotherapy and only the second reported case. METHODS: Procedural details with associated imaging including endoscopic airway and swallowing evaluation are included. A literature review of cervical and laryngeal sclerotherapy complications was performed and discussed. RESULTS: A 12-month-old male underwent sclerotherapy with doxycycline for a complex parapharyngeal and paralaryngeal venolymphatic malformation. The postoperative course was complicated by new onset dysphagia, aspiration, and decreased laryngeal sensation. Gastric feeding and swallowing therapy were necessary due to prolonged difficulty. The sclerotherapy treatment resulted in near elimination of the cervical components of the lesion at 12 months follow up. The child progressed to total oral feeding by 17 months post-treatment with no evidence of decreased laryngeal sensation. An extensive literature review identified only one reported case of new onset dysphagia and decreased laryngeal sensation after doxycycline sclerotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Doxycycline sclerotherapy for cervical venolymphatic malformations rarely can cause adjacent neural injury resulting in laryngeal complications. Our case report and literature review suggest that symptom management and appropriate aspiration precautions are necessary in infants or children with presumed vagus or laryngeal nerve injury, and injury is likely only temporary.",

The most common cause is the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak within the spinal canal. Although previously reported in only a few cases, also paraspinal lymphatic malformations causing vertebral bone destruction may occasionally result in CSF leak to these pathological formations. Here, we present a case of a 9-year-old girl with generalized lymphatic anomaly (GLA) presenting with severe postural headache. Radiological imaging revealed a typical feature of cerebellar sagging. Myelography localized the CSF leakage into vertebral bodies of C7 and Th1, which both were partly involved in pathological paravertebral masses of known lymphatic anomaly, and from there along the right C8 nerve root sleeve into the anomaly. As the C8-nerve root could not be ligated due to the risk of significant neurological injury, we attempted image-guided targeted percutaneous epidural placement of a blood patch directly into the foramen at the affected level. The procedure resulted in obliteration of the fistula and regression of cerebellar sagging, with significant relief of symptoms. Although it is an extremely rare coincidence, patients with paraspinal lymphatic malformations may develop intraspinal CSF leak into these pathological formations. The present case report suggests that besides a direct surgical obliteration of the fistula and sacrificing the nerve root, a targeted percutaneous epidural blood patch may be a possible alternative in the case of a functionally important nerve root.",

                    "abstract": "Context: In neonates, iatrogenic hypothyroidism can result from topical or IV iodine exposure. Data on intralymphatic iodine exposure, risk factors for disease severity, and timing of hypothyroidism are limited. Case Descriptions: We report 4 cases of premature neonates with previously normal thyroid function tests (TFTs) who developed hypothyroidism after intralymphatic iodinated contrast. Patients 1 and 2, premature infants with complex medical histories, had chylous effusions and high-volume chest tube output requiring imaging with lymphangiograms on day of life (DOL) 97 and DOL 43, respectively. They developed severe, primary hypothyroidism with TSH of 335.7 mIU/mL (reference range, 1.7 to 9.1) on DOL 111 and TSH of 470.2 mIU/mL (reference range, 1.7 to 9.1) on DOL 68. Patient 3 had prenatally diagnosed fetal hydrops manifesting with chylous effusions and high-volume chest tube output. The infant underwent lymphangiography on DOL 90 and was noted to have an elevated TSH of 13.35 mIU/mL (reference range, 1.7 to 9.1) 4 days later with spot urine iodine of 1742 microg/L (normal, <200). Patient 4 had a lymphatic malformation and underwent sclerotherapy with doxycycline with intralymphatic iodine exposure on DOL 4 and was found to have a TSH of 16.7 microU/mL (reference range, 1.7 to 9.1) 3 days later with spot urine iodine of 228,712 microg/L (normal, <200). The TFT results for all patients improved after levothyroxine administration. Conclusion: Intralymphatic iodine should be considered a major risk factor in the development of iatrogenic primary hypothyroidism, especially in premature neonates soon after exposure. Close monitoring of TFTs is imperative to avoid potential long-term adverse outcomes in this population.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lymphatic vascular malformations are rare findings in canine patients with six reports available in veterinary literature. Retroperitoneal cystic lymphatic malformations have not been described previously in canine patients and neither has the use of immunohistochemistry to determine their origin, i.e. vascular versus lymphatic. CASE PRESENTATION: An 8-year-old neutered female Cocker spaniel was referred for pollakiuria, dysuria and a painful abdomen. Computed tomography scanning of the abdomen showed a fluid filled structure adjacent to the urinary bladder. During surgical exploration, a thin walled cystic structure with sero-haemorrhagic fluid was found, extending from the retroperitoneal space into the abdomen. The mass was excised and submitted for histopathology, revealing a cystic mass lined by a fibrovascular capsule within the retroperitoneal/mesenteric adipose tissue. The inner surface of the cyst was lined by a single layer of bland, flattened spindle cells. Intramural blood vessels were well differentiated, with perivascular haemorrhage. On recurrence 11 months later, the mass was excised for the second time and a PleuralPort (Norfolk Animal products) was placed. Fifteen months after initial presentation, progression occurred with haemorrhagic fluid in the cystic space, pleural- and abdominal cavities and the owners opted for euthanasia. Histopathology and positive immunohistochemistry for lymphatic markers lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronic acid receptor-1 (LYVE-1) and prospero homeobox protein-1 (PROX-1) confirmed a lymphatic vascular origin of the cystic structure. CONCLUSIONS: To our experience, a definitive diagnosis of retroperitoneal cystic malformation of lymphatic origin could be done only by combining the clinical presentation, advanced imaging, histopathology and LYVE-1 and PROX-1 immunohistochemistry. This is the first report of a vascular malformation in a dog where immunohistochemistry was used to make a final diagnosis. A lymphatic malformation, even if rare, should be added on the list of the differential diagnosis in a patient with a retroperitoneal cystic structure containing serohaemorrhagic fluid. Results of this case report can aid in diagnosis of future cases, however, further studies on therapy and management are needed to provide additional information about optimal treatment of these patients.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Detection of fetal airway compromise through imaging raises the possible need for ex utero intrapartum treatment (EXIT) procedures. Despite EXIT procedures involving massive resource utilization and posing increased risk to the mother, decisions for EXIT are usually based on anecdotal experience. Our objectives were to analyze prenatal consultations with potential fetal airway obstruction for imaging and obstetric findings used to determine management strategy. METHODS: Retrospective chart review was performed for prenatal abnormal fetal airway consults between 2004-2019 at a quaternary pediatric facility. Data collected included demographics, imaging characteristics, delivery information, and airway management. Our primary outcome was EXIT performance and the secondary outcome was postnatal airway management. Fisher's exact test was used to compare management decisions, outcomes, and imaging findings. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients met inclusion criteria. The most common diagnoses observed were lymphatic malformation, teratoma, and micrognathia. Of the imaging findings collected, only midline neck mass location was associated with EXIT procedure performance. Factors associated with invasive airway support at birth were mass-induced in-utero neck extension and neck vessel compression, polyhydramnios, and micrognathia. CONCLUSIONS: Multidisciplinary input and interpretation of prenatal imaging can guide management of fetal airway-related pathology. EXIT is an overall safe procedure and can decrease risk due to airway obstruction at birth. We identified in-utero neck extension, neck vessel compression, micrognathia, and polyhydramnios as better indicators of a need for invasive airways measures at birth and suggest use of these criteria in combination with clinical judgement when recommending EXIT.

Our aim was to identify factors associated with the occurrence of permanent postoperative complications. METHODS: This was a case series study of children operated on for LMs between 2001 and 2021 and followed-up in our institution. Patients who presented sequelae derived from surgical treatment (cases) and those who did not (controls) were compared. RESULTS: We included 112 children who underwent surgery for LMs in different centers. Forty-nine cases and 63 controls were included (58% male), with a mean age of 34 months. Patients younger than 1 year presented more complications than older children, 59% (n = 29/49) vs 41% (n = 24/49), respectively (P = .02). LMs were in the cervicofacial region in seven patients in the control group compared with 30 of the cases (P <= .001), with microcystic malformations the most associated with sequelae (n = 11/15; P = .019). Concerning permanent complications, 88% were neurological (n = 43/49), mainly peripheral facial palsy (n = 17). There was greater postoperative residual disease in controls compared with cases (65% vs 14%, respectively; P <= .0001). However, following a second procedure in the control group, there was no significant difference in long-term cure rates (P = .38). CONCLUSIONS: The risk of sequelae following surgery for LM increases significantly in patients younger than 12 months in cervicofacial and microcystic malformations. Because non-radical resections are associated with fewer complications and an optimal long-term cure rate, we consider that aggressive surgical approaches should be avoided if the absence of sequelae is not guaranteed.",

However, there have been rare reported cases of pulmonary injury observed in children after bleomycin intralesional administration. We report a case of fatal lung toxicity in a 15-month-old girl after injecting 7 units of bleomycin into a left cheek macrocystic lymphatic malformation. 1 week after therapy, she developed respiratory distress with imaging findings of pneumothorax and diffuse alveolar damage. Despite extensive management and resuscitative efforts of presumed pneumonitis, further decline resulted in death via respiratory failure. Early detection of pulmonary toxicity would allow prompt therapy and could avoid significant pulmonary damage.",

                    "abstract": "Background: Sclerotherapy is the first-line therapeutic method for lymphatic malformations (LMs). This retrospective cohort study evaluated the effectiveness and safety of a novel combined foam sclerosant: polidocanol and pingyangmycin foam (PPF), for treating cervicofacial macrocystic LMs. Methods and Results: From July 2018 to October 2020, 51 patients with cervicofacial macrocystic LMs were enrolled in this study. All patients received intralesional 3% polidocanol or PPF injections. The outcome was evaluated regarding demographic and clinical characteristics, degree of treatment response, and post-treatment complications. Overall, 16 patients (31.4%) underwent PPF sclerotherapy. All these patients (100%) showed remarkable reduction in lesion size within three sessions. Excellent responses were shown in 88.5% of these patients within three sessions, which is higher than single polidocanol sclerotherapy (80%). The average sessions (duration) of PPF sclerotherapy were 2.5, which was significantly shorter than the single foam sclerotherapy (p < 0.05). Treatment duration was significantly associated with age, lesion location, lesion size, and number of cysts (p < 0.05). No severe complications were noted in this study. Local or systemic complications, such as swelling and mild fever occurred but subsided without any specific treatment. Conclusions: PPF is a safe, and effective combined foam sclerosant for the treatment of cervicofacial macrocystic LMs. This combined foam can improve treatment response and reduce treatment duration compared with a single sclerosant. It can be broadly used if further large-scale clinical trials verify its efficacy and safety.",

METHOD: From January 2019 to July 2021, indocyanine green lymphography was performed preoperatively to confirm the lymph inflow, and this treatment was administered in 71 patients with cervicofacial cLM in our center. All cases were evaluated by curative effects, treatment frequency, and adverse events. The duration of posttreatment follow-up was from 12 to 14 months. RESULTS: Indocyanine green lymphography indicated at least one lymphatic inflow in each cLM lesion. Excellent resolution was observed in 87.3% of cases, and good improvement of the treated cLM occurred in 9.9% of cases, and 2 cases with fair outcomes required subsequent treatment. It is noteworthy that no case was treated more than 3 times. Some minor adverse effects, including localized itch and scar, were managed by symptomatic treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Because of satisfactory outcomes and low treatment frequency, ultrasound-guided iodine tincture cauterization combined with intralesional negative pressure represents an efficacious, safe, and feasible method for the management of macro-cLM in the cervicofacial region.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The patients with cervical-facial lymphatic malformations were reviewed in Shanghai Children's Hospital from August 2014 to August 2018. Data analysis was performed using SPSS17.0. Pearson X2 test and t-test were used, and the significance level was fixed at 5%. RESULTS: 72 patients in all of which 63 patients underwent surgical excision combined with bleomycin irrigation and 9 patients underwent sclerotherapy alone as the primary treatment. The surgical excision group had a significantly higher rate of an excellent response compare to the sclerotherapy group (P < 0.05). In regards to postoperative complications, the surgical group had no higher rate of temporal facial paralysis and other nerve injures compare to the sclerotherapy group (P = 0.624). CONCLUSIONS: we recommend surgery combined with Bleomycin for microcystic disease with focal and less infiltrative lesions and for lesions located in the oropharynx, parapharynx, retropharynx, or hypopharynx.",

LMs are categorized by cyst size as microcystic, macrocystic, or combined. Abdominal LMs are rare. Surgical resection of abdominal LMs has been the mainstay of therapy, but recurrence and morbidity are high. We sought to determine the effectiveness of sclerotherapy treatment for abdominal LM. METHODS: A single-center, retrospective review from 2014 to 2018 was conducted evaluating pediatric patients with abdominal LM. RESULTS: Ten patients were included, n = 9 had macrocystic LM and one patient had combined disease. The average age at first treatment was 6.8 y. The most common presenting symptoms were abdominal distention, pain, infection, and anemia. Preprocedural imaging was performed for all patients; median pretreatment volume was 1572.9 cm3 (range, 67.2-13,226.4). LMs were accessed using ultrasound guidance and injected with opacified doxycycline. Patients received a mean of 7.1 sclerotherapy injections. Complications included intraperitoneal doxycycline extravasation (n = 1), managed conservatively, and LM infection (n = 1), treated with intravenous antibiotics and drainage. One patient went on to surgical resection due to inability gain stable intracystic access; follow-up ultrasonography showed no recurrence. Postprocedural imaging was available in n = 8. Volume decreased by 96.7% after sclerotherapy. The median remaining volume was 0 cm3 (range, 0-599.7) (P = 0.016). Postsclerotherapy magnetic resonance imaging was obtained in n = 6, with complete resolution in 83.3%. All patients had resolution of presenting symptoms. Follow-up duration was 12.3 mo. CONCLUSIONS: Initial results demonstrate that sclerotherapy is an effective and durable treatment for symptom resolution and volume reduction of abdominal LM.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Detection of fetal airway compromise through imaging raises the possible need for ex utero intrapartum treatment (EXIT) procedures. Despite EXIT procedures involving massive resource utilization and posing increased risk to the mother, decisions for EXIT are usually based on anecdotal experience. Our objectives were to analyze prenatal consultations with potential fetal airway obstruction for imaging and obstetric findings used to determine management strategy. METHODS: Retrospective chart review was performed for prenatal abnormal fetal airway consults between 2004-2019 at a quaternary pediatric facility. Data collected included demographics, imaging characteristics, delivery information, and airway management. Our primary outcome was EXIT performance and the secondary outcome was postnatal airway management. Fisher's exact test was used to compare management decisions, outcomes, and imaging findings. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients met inclusion criteria. The most common diagnoses observed were lymphatic malformation, teratoma, and micrognathia. Of the imaging findings collected, only midline neck mass location was associated with EXIT procedure performance. Factors associated with invasive airway support at birth were mass-induced in-utero neck extension and neck vessel compression, polyhydramnios, and micrognathia. CONCLUSIONS: Multidisciplinary input and interpretation of prenatal imaging can guide management of fetal airway-related pathology. EXIT is an overall safe procedure and can decrease risk due to airway obstruction at birth. We identified in-utero neck extension, neck vessel compression, micrognathia, and polyhydramnios as better indicators of a need for invasive airways measures at birth and suggest use of these criteria in combination with clinical judgement when recommending EXIT.

The EXIT (Ex Utero Intrapartum Treatment) technique con sists of ensuring the newborn's airway while is still receiving placental support. This technique has not been standardized in developing countries. OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical outcomes of two infants who underwent the EXIT technique. CLINICAL CASE: We present two cases, one with lymphatic malformation diagnosed at 20 weeks of gestational age (WGE) and the second one, a preterm newborn with thyromegaly and polyhydramnios, diagnosed at 35 WGE. In both cases, during the C-section, the EXIT technique was performed with a team of a neonatologist, a gyne cologist, an anesthesiologist, a pediatric surgeon, an otolaryngologist, a nurse, and a respiratory therapist. In both patients, the neonatologist achieved to secure the airway through orotracheal intubation at the first attempt. In the first case, lymphatic malformation was confirmed and re ceived sclerotherapy, and the second one was diagnosed with congenital hypothyroidism which was managed with levothyroxine. The patients needed invasive mechanical ventilation for 7 and 9 days, respectively, and were discharged without respiratory complications. CONCLUSIONS: In these patients, the EXIT technique was a safe procedure, carried out without inconvenience. A multi disciplinary approach and the availability of a neonatal intensive care unit are needed to reduce potential complications and ensure postnatal management. Timely prenatal diagnosis is essential to perform this technique.",

Understanding lymphatic malformation natural history is essential. We describe management of head and neck lymphatic malformations where decisions primarily addressed lesion-induced functional compromise (ie, breathing, swallowing) to identify factors associated with invasive treatment and active observation. We hypothesize that non-function threatening malformations can be observed. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series. METHODS: Retrospective case series of consecutive head and neck lymphatic malformation patients (2000-2017) with over 2 years of follow-up. Patient characteristics were summarized and associations with invasive treatment (surgery or sclerotherapy) tested using Fisher's exact. In observed patients, factors associated with spontaneous regression were assessed with Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: Of 191 patients, 101 (53%) were male, 97 (51%) Caucasian, and 98 (51.3%) younger than 3 months. Malformations were de Serres I-III 167 (87%), or IV-V 24 (12%), and commonly located in the neck (101, 53%), or oral cavity (36, 19%). Initial treatments included observation (65, 34%) or invasive treatments such as primary surgery (80, 42%), staged surgery (25, 13%), or primary sclerotherapy (9, 5%). Of 65 initially observed malformations, 8 (12%) subsequently had invasive treatment, 36 (58%) had spontaneous regression, and 21 (32%) elected for no invasive therapy. Spontaneous regression was associated with location in the lateral neck (P = .003) and macrocystic malformations (P = .017). CONCLUSION: Head and neck lymphatic malformation treatment selection can be individualized after stratifying by stage, presence of functional compromise, and consideration of natural history. Recognizing the spectrum of severity is essential in evaluating efficacy of emerging treatments, as selected malformations may respond to observation.

Data analysis was performed using SPSS17.0. Pearson X2 test and t-test were used, and the significance level was fixed at 5%. RESULTS: 72 patients in all of which 63 patients underwent surgical excision combined with bleomycin irrigation and 9 patients underwent sclerotherapy alone as the primary treatment. The surgical excision group had a significantly higher rate of an excellent response compare to the sclerotherapy group (P < 0.05). In regards to postoperative complications, the surgical group had no higher rate of temporal facial paralysis and other nerve injures compare to the sclerotherapy group (P = 0.624). CONCLUSIONS: we recommend surgery combined with Bleomycin for microcystic disease with focal and less infiltrative lesions and for lesions located in the oropharynx, parapharynx, retropharynx, or hypopharynx.",

In this study, we present 8 children with LM who were treated with the Kampo medicine eppikajutsuto (EKJT).Between 2001 and 2020, 8 children (male: 4, female: 4) with LMs who underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation both before and after treatment or observation were selected for investigating the effect of EKJT. Two patients were observed without any treatment for 24 and 60 months. EKJT was evaluated based on percentage reduction, defined as the percentage of total lesions that decreased in size, confirmed by radiological examination after initiating treatment with EKJT or determined by observation alone. Volumetric analysis of LMs on MRI was performed using the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine viewer.Six patients were treated with EKJT. The mean observational period was 13.2 months (range: 6-24 months). The mean reduction in LM volume on MRI was 73.0% in treated patients and -66.3% in observed patients. Two of the 6 lesions exhibited complete reduction, 2 exhibited marked (>90%) reduction, 1 exhibited moderate reduction, and 1 exhibited a small response. The treatment was well-tolerated, with no severe adverse events.This preliminary study demonstrated the beneficial effects of EKJT. Prospective evaluations of this promising therapeutic modality are warranted based on the results of this study.",

                    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Lymphatic malformations (LMs) are low-flow lesions resulting from abnormalities in the development of lymphatics. The management of these lesions is complex and involve the collaboration of many specialties. The purpose of this review is to summarize current knowledge regarding the different therapeutic options used in complex lymphatic malformations, analyzing their indications, efficacy and complications. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A search was made using the algorithm: \"(lymphatic abnormality OR lymphatic malformation OR lymphangioma OR cystic hygroma) AND (extensive OR giant OR complex) AND (therapeutics OR treatment) AND (child OR children)\". Of the 120 articles found, 53 were included. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Historically, surgery was the treatment of choice for this type of lesions. However, excision was often incomplete, associated with high rates of recurrence and severe complications. The use of sclerotherapy emerged as a minimal invasive option appropriate in selected cases as a single or adjuvant therapy. Inhibitors of the mammalian target of rapamycin, such as sirolimus, now play a central role in the treatment of complex malformations resistant to sclerotherapy, recurrent after surgery or more extensive malformations that affect vital structures. Other therapeutic options as sildenafil and laser ablation are also recognized as effective in selected cases. CONCLUSIONS: Looking through the literature over the last decade authors realize that surgery had gradually been replaced by less invasive options such as sirolimus with or without adjuvant sclerotherapy. In conclusion, each treatment option seems to have its own indications and characteristics, which must be considered in therapeutic decision and individualized for each patient.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Lymphatic malformations (LM) are congenital malformations of the lymphatic system, mainly located in the head and neck area. They can be staged based on location according to de Serres and based on different morbidity items using the Cologne Disease Score (CDS), a clinical staging system. In many cases, functional impairment greatly affects the life of patients suffering from lymphatic malformations. The present study aims to analyze a cohort of pediatric patients with LM. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 144 pediatric patients with head and neck LM was performed. Location, type of malformation (microcystic, macrocystic, mixed), scoring according to two different scoring systems and therapy were analyzed. Kruskal-Wallis test was used to analyze the difference in CDS between the patient groups and Dunn's test was used for post-hoc pairwise comparison. RESULTS: The average age at presentation was 6.1 years. The most common sites were neck (47%), cheek/parotid gland (26%), tongue (17%) and orbit (8%). Macrocystic malformations dominated the lateral neck, while microcystic malformations were predominantly localized in the tongue and floor of mouth. Macrocystic malformations (mean CDS 9.44) were associated with significantly better CDS than microcystic (mean CDS 7.11) and mixed (mean CDS 5.71) malformations (p < 0.001). LM in stage V according to de Serres had the lowest values (mean CDS: 4.26). The most common therapeutic procedures were conventional surgical (partial) resection, laser therapy and sclerotherapy with OK-432. CONCLUSIONS: There is an association between malformation type, location according to de Serres and CDS in children with LM of the head and neck. Patients with microcystic and mixed malformations in stage V had lowest CDS levels.",

Progressive growth of lesions may cause pressure to the surrounding organs. Lesions frequently reoccur after treatment with surgery, sclerotherapy, radiotherapy, and laser therapy. In the last decades, oral sirolimus has been successfully used in lymphatic malformations. Since systemic treatment with sirolimus is associated with various side effects, topical form of the drug has been used with satisfying results, especially for the angiofibromas. Promisingly, few case studies indicate topical sirolimus as a potential treatment for the lymphatic malformations. Here, we report an 8-year-old girl with MLM on left trunk whose lesions recurred after the surgery that has been performed at 1 year of age. We administered twice daily topical sirolimus at 0.75 mg/ml concentration. After 2 weeks, a local irritation occurred and the dose was decreased to once daily. The treatment was stopped at the end of 3 months as the lesions were almost cleared and the patient did not want to continue to therapy. There were no new lesions after 8 months of follow up.",

They arise due to errors in vascular and lymphatic formation during early embryonic development. This leads to persistent infiltration of lymph fluid into soft tissues and causes a locally invasive mass with pathologic sequelae. Departing from historically descriptive terminology, such as \"cystic hygroma,\" lymphatic malformations are now categorized as macrocystic, microcystic, or mixed lesions, based on size. Advances in imaging modalities, such as ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging, have made accurate characterization of these lesions possible and ultimately allow for early diagnosis and implementation of appropriate treatment based on the morphology of the lymphatic malformation. Management of lymphatic malformations can be quite challenging, and a multidisciplinary approach is most effective for optimum aesthetic and functional outcomes. New discoveries in the molecular biology of lymphatic malformations have provided treatment targets and established a role for pharmacotherapy. Sclerotherapy, laser, and radiofrequency ablation have all proven to be effective as minimally invasive treatment options for lymphatic malformations. Surgical intervention has a role in the treatment of focal lesions recalcitrant to these less invasive techniques. Operative planning is dictated by clinical goals, size, anatomic location, characteristics, and extent of infiltration.",

Few effective options exist in refractory cases. METHODS: Patients aged 0 to 12 months with refractory chylous ascites underwent retroperitoneal exploration after medical treatment and minimally invasive therapies were unsuccessful. The retroperitoneum was completely exposed via left and right medial visceral rotation and opening the lesser sac. Visible leaks were ligated, and alternating layers of fibrin glue and Vicryl mesh were used to cover the entire retroperitoneum. RESULTS: All 4 patients had resolution of their chylous ascites. None required reoperation or reintervention for chyle leaks. All achieved goal enteral feeds at a median of 29 days postoperatively and were discharged from hospital at a median of 42 days postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: Management of chylous ascites is extremely challenging in refractory cases. Complete retroperitoneal exposure with fibrin glue and Vicryl mesh application offers a definitive, reliable therapy for achieving cessation of lymphatic leakage and ultimate recovery for patients who fail all nonoperative approaches.

                    "abstract": "Objective:To present experience and evaluate the safety and efficacy of surgery combined with bleomycin irrigation for the management of head and neck lymphatic malformations in children. Methods:The medical records of all patients with cervical-facial lymphatic malformations who presented to Shanghai Children's Hospital from August 2014 to December 2020 were reviewed. 97 children were divided into surgery group(81 cases) and sclerotherapy group(16 cases). Conventional contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) and B-ultrasound examinations were performed both preoperatively and postoperatively. The surgical group received lymphangioma resection combined with bleomycin irrigation. The sclerotherapy group was treated with B-ultrasound-guided percutaneous lymphangioma aspiration and bleomycin sclerotherapy. SPSS 21.0 software was used to evaluate the clinical cure rate and postoperative complications of lesions in both groups by chi-square test. Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate the disease-free survival rate and draw survival curve. Results:In the surgery group of 81 children, 64 cases were cured and 17 cases were effective while in the sclerosis group, 8 cases were cured and 8 cases were effective. Cox proportional risk model found that children in the surgery group had a higher cure rate and a lower risk of 5-year recurrence than those in the sclerotherapy group, with statistically significant differences(chi2=5.814, P<0.05). The risk of recurrence in the surgery group was 35.4% of that in the sclerotherapy group(HR=0.354, P<0.05). In regards to postoperative complications, the surgical group had no higher rate of temporal facial paralysis and other nerve injuries compared to the sclerotherapy group(chi2=1.041, P=0.308). Conclusion:Surgery combined with bleomycin irrigation in the complex cervical-facial lymphatic malformations was confirmed to be effectively and safely. The principle of the surgery was to protect the structure and function of normal tissue while excising the lesions as much as possible. When the lesions involved the posterior two-thirds of the tongue, the floor of the mouth, parapharynx, retropharynx, or hypopharynx spaces. Radiofrequency ablation was used in the surgical excision, which made the surgery more minimally invasive, accurate and personalized.",

They arise due to errors in vascular and lymphatic formation during early embryonic development. This leads to persistent infiltration of lymph fluid into soft tissues and causes a locally invasive mass with pathologic sequelae. Departing from historically descriptive terminology, such as \"cystic hygroma,\" lymphatic malformations are now categorized as macrocystic, microcystic, or mixed lesions, based on size. Advances in imaging modalities, such as ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging, have made accurate characterization of these lesions possible and ultimately allow for early diagnosis and implementation of appropriate treatment based on the morphology of the lymphatic malformation. Management of lymphatic malformations can be quite challenging, and a multidisciplinary approach is most effective for optimum aesthetic and functional outcomes. New discoveries in the molecular biology of lymphatic malformations have provided treatment targets and established a role for pharmacotherapy. Sclerotherapy, laser, and radiofrequency ablation have all proven to be effective as minimally invasive treatment options for lymphatic malformations. Surgical intervention has a role in the treatment of focal lesions recalcitrant to these less invasive techniques. Operative planning is dictated by clinical goals, size, anatomic location, characteristics, and extent of infiltration.",

                    "abstract": "Lymphatic malformations (LMs) are developmental defects of lymphatic vessels. LMs are histologically benign lesions, however, due to localization, size, and unexpected swelling, they may cause serious complications that threaten vital functions such as compression of the airways. A large swelling of the face or neck may also be disfiguring and thus constitute a psychological strain for patients and their families. LMs are also highly immunologically reactive, and are prone to recurrent infections and inflammation causing pain as well as chronic oozing wounds. The European Reference Network on Rare Multisystemic Vascular Diseases (VASCERN) is dedicated to gathering the best expertise in Europe. There are only few available guidelines on management and follow up of LMs, which commonly focus on very specific situations, such as head and neck LM (Zhou et al., 2011). It is still unclear, what constitutes an indication for treatment of LMs and how to follow up the patients. The Vascular Anomalies Working Group (VASCA-WG) of VASCERN decided to develop a diagnostic and management pathway for the management of LMs with a Nominal Group Technique (NGT), a well-established, structured, multistep, facilitated group meeting technique used to generate consensus statements. The pathway was drawn following 2 face-to-face meetings and multiple web meetings to facilitate discussion, and by mail to avoid the influence of most authoritative members. The VASCA-WG has produced this opinion statement reflecting strategies developed by experts and patient representatives on how to approach patients with lymphatic malformations in a practical manner; we present an algorithmic view of the results of our work.",

The current hypothesis is that the earlier the lesion is treated, the better it responds. This has prompted the idea that sirolimus administration might be efficacious to treat fetal LMs as well. Here we report a successful management of a cervicofacial fetal LM with sirolimus taken orally by the mother from the 22nd week of pregnancy until 2 weeks before planned delivery. Repeated cordocentesis recorded a 30% transplacental crossing of sirolimus. Continuation of sirolimus after birth allowed resection of the residual mass. We have followed the physical and neurological evolution of the child for 6 years since the fetal administration of sirolimus. We conclude that early administration of sirolimus during pregnancy with maternal serum monitoring may be proposed to high-risk fetal LMs in selected cases.",

Although typically managed with bowel rest, parenteral nutrition, and octreotide, persistent chylothoraces require surgical management. At our institution, a pleurectomy, unilateral or bilateral, in combination with mechanical pleurodesis and thoracic duct ligation is performed for SCC, and we describe our approach and outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed over 15-year period neonatal patients with SCC managed surgically with pleurectomy after medical therapy was unsuccessful. Patients were divided into two groups: those who underwent pleurectomy within 28 d of diagnosis (early group) and those who underwent pleurectomy after 28 d (late group). Resolution of chylothorax was defined by the absence of clinical symptoms as well as absent or minimal pleural effusion on chest X-ray. RESULTS: Of 40 patients diagnosed with SCC over the study period, 15 underwent pleurectomy, eight early [mean time to operation = 20 (IQR 17, 23) d] and 7 late [59 (42, 75) d, P = 0.001]. Overall survival was 67% (10 of 15). Seven of 8 (88%) neonates who underwent early pleurectomy survived versus 3 of 7 (43%) who underwent late pleurectomy (P = 0.07). Length of stay was lower in the early group than the late group [73 (57, 79) versus 102 (109, 213) d, P = 0.05]. All patients who survived to discharge had resolution of their chylothorax.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Abdominal lymphatic malformations (LM) are a rare subset of vascular anomaly caused by abnormal development of the lymphatic system. They are classified as macrocystic, microcystic or combination macrocystic and microcystic. Surgical resection, percutaneous sclerotherapy, and medical therapy are all employed to treat these complex and often symptomatic lesions. No standardized treatment algorithm exists currently. The purpose of this study was to establish a multidisciplinary treatment approach to abdominal LMs. METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted from 2013 to 2019 on patients with abdominal LMs at a single tertiary children's hospital vascular anomalies center. Demographics, imaging, and treatment modality were recorded. Clinical and/or radiographic response to the primary treatment modality as well as complications was the outcomes measured. RESULTS: Nineteen patients (12 macrocystic, 5 microcystic and 2 combined) were identified, with a median age at diagnosis of 2.2 years (range 0.1-20.8 years). Sclerotherapy was the most common primary treatment, followed by surgical resection and sirolimus. No difference in clinical response (p = 0.58) or complications (p = 0.31) was observed based on primary treatment or subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our institutional experience, we propose an LM subtype-based treatment algorithm for abdominal LMs. It employs a multidisciplinary approach, and results in satisfactory patient outcomes with minimal complications.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Large fetal head and neck (HN) masses can be life-threatening at birth and postnatally owing to airway obstruction. The two most frequent congenital masses that may obstruct the airway are lymphatic malformation (LM) and teratoma. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the results of our experience in the management of giant congenital HN masses and to conduct a literature review. METHODS: The study involved a consecutive series of 13 newborns (7 females) affected by giant HN masses. Prenatal diagnosis was achieved by means of ultrasound (US) and fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Delivery was performed by means of EXIT procedure in case of radiological evidence of airway obstruction. In the postnatal period all feasible therapeutic options (surgery, sclerotherapy, medical therapy) were discussed and adopted by a multidisciplinary team. Twelve patients underwent surgery and one received Rapamycin for one month, with consequent surgical resection owing to increasing size of the mass. RESULTS: The histopathological diagnosis was LM in 11 cases and teratoma in 2 cases. Airway obstruction was solved in 11 cases; 2 LM patients required a tracheotomy because of persistent airway obstruction. Major complications were flap necrosis (one patient) and facial nerve palsy (2 cases). Recurrence occurred in 5 patients. CONCLUSIONS: The management of congenital HN masses is always challenging and necessarily requires an interdisciplinary approach. Current therapeutic options include surgery, sclerotherapy, medical therapy or a combination of them. When they are large enough to obstruct the airway, a patient-centered approach should guide timing and modality of treatment. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV.",

The goal of this systematic review is to summarize outcomes for medical therapy, sclerotherapy, and surgery, and to provide evidence-based recommendations regarding the treatment. METHODS: Three questions regarding LM management were generated according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Publicly available databases were queried to identify articles published from January 1, 1990, to December 31, 2021. A consensus statement of recommendations was generated in response to each question. RESULTS: The initial search identified 9326 abstracts, each reviewed by two authors. A total of 600 abstracts met selection criteria for full manuscript review with 202 subsequently utilized for extraction of data. Medical therapy, such as sirolimus, can be used as an adjunct with percutaneous treatments or surgery, or for extensive LM. Sclerotherapy can achieve partial or complete response in over 90% of patients and is most effective for macrocystic lesions. Depending on the size, extent, and location of the malformation, surgery can be considered. CONCLUSION: Evidence supporting best practices for the safety and effectiveness of management for LMs is currently of moderate quality. Many patients benefit from multi-modal treatment determined by the extent and type of LM. A multidisciplinary approach is recommended to determine the optimal individualized treatment for each patient. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4: ",

Their clinical diagnosis is difficult, and imaging studies are essential to determine the type and extent of vessels involved. Treatment can be challenging and must be managed by a multidisciplinary team. METHODS: A descriptive, observational, retrospective, longitudinal study of clinical records of patients diagnosed with IVMs who were evaluated at the vascular anomalies clinic from January 2011 to December 2021 was performed. Demographic, clinical, imaging, diagnosis, treatment, and response data were collected. RESULTS: Seven patients (five females and two males) with a mean age of 13.66 years (standard deviation 5.82 years) were included in the study. In all cases, the clinical diagnosis was venous and lymphatic malformation. The radiological findings were dilated and tortuous vascular structures or multilobulated lesions with septa inside, with or without vascular flow; these findings allowed diagnosis in all cases. Treatment modalities included sclerotherapy in five patients, surgical resection in two, medical treatment with sirolimus in three, and surveillance in one. Subsequent clinical evolution was favorable in all patients, with decreased pain in six (partial in four and total in two) and size reduction in one patient. CONCLUSION: IVMs in our pediatric population most frequently affect the lower extremities. The main symptoms and signs were pain on exertion and volume increase. Treatment can be challenging given the extension and depth of the malformations, so a combination of therapeutic modalities may be necessary to obtain the best outcome.",

Retrospective data from our institution, encompassing 53 pediatric patients with 275 blood concentration results over the past five years (average age: 4.64 +- 4.19 years), constituted the foundation of this analysis. The final model, adopting a first-order absorption and elimination single-compartment model, retained age as the sole covariate. Results indicated a robust correlation between apparent clearance (CL/F) at 5.56 L/h, apparent volume of distribution (V/F) at 292.57 L, and age. Monte Carlo simulation guided initial dosages for patients aged 0-18 years within the target concentration range. This study presents the first PopPK model using a large Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) database to describe personalized sirolimus dosing for pediatric iLM patients, contributing to pharmacokinetic guidance and potentially improving long-term clinical outcomes.",

We describe the unique clinical course, diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes of patients with cervical lymphatic malformation (CLM) managed with EXIT. METHODS: Review of fetuses with diagnosed CLM was delivered by EXIT (2001-2018) in a tertiary referral fetal center. Outcomes included survival, tracheostomy at discharge, neonatal course after delivery, and pulmonary hypoplasia. Data are reported as median [range] and rate (%). RESULTS: Out of 45 patients delivered by EXIT, 10 were delivered for CLM: seven had polyhydramnios, one had nonimmune hydrops, five delivered preterm, and three were emergency EXITs. The EXIT time and estimated blood loss were 125 minutes (95, 158) and 900 mL (500, 1500), respectively. Airway was secured in all. There was one neonatal death (day 8) with prematurity, sepsis, and pulmonary hypoplasia. Three out of nine were discharged with a tracheostomy. CONCLUSION: In CLM, close monitoring for structural neck involvement and development of polyhydramnios are important and may be an indication for EXIT as the optimal delivery mode. An experienced multidisciplinary team is a key factor for an effective approach to the obstructed airway in CLM.",

Cervical masses were detected by ultrasound late in the third trimester. Following interdisciplinary case conferences, a caesarean section in the presence of a neonatal team was the chosen delivery mode in both cases. Delivery and transition of the newborns were uneventful. The suspected diagnosis was confirmed by postnatal MRIs, which demonstrated neither associated malformations nor compression of vital structures. Therefore, an expectant approach was chosen for the newborn with the smaller lesion. The other newborn featured a sizeable lymphatic malformation, and due to consecutive head tilt, sclerotherapy was initiated in its second week of life. Our case report outlines the challenges of a rare connatal malformation. Guidelines are often missing. Individual decisions regarding delivery mode, diagnostics and therapy have to be made on an interdisciplinary basis and patients as well as parents need counseling and support over a long period. All the more significant is good, interdisciplinary collaboration between the involved disciplines.",

In this study, we present 8 children with LM who were treated with the Kampo medicine eppikajutsuto (EKJT).Between 2001 and 2020, 8 children (male: 4, female: 4) with LMs who underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation both before and after treatment or observation were selected for investigating the effect of EKJT. Two patients were observed without any treatment for 24 and 60 months. EKJT was evaluated based on percentage reduction, defined as the percentage of total lesions that decreased in size, confirmed by radiological examination after initiating treatment with EKJT or determined by observation alone. Volumetric analysis of LMs on MRI was performed using the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine viewer.Six patients were treated with EKJT. The mean observational period was 13.2 months (range: 6-24 months). The mean reduction in LM volume on MRI was 73.0% in treated patients and -66.3% in observed patients. Two of the 6 lesions exhibited complete reduction, 2 exhibited marked (>90%) reduction, 1 exhibited moderate reduction, and 1 exhibited a small response. The treatment was well-tolerated, with no severe adverse events.This preliminary study demonstrated the beneficial effects of EKJT. Prospective evaluations of this promising therapeutic modality are warranted based on the results of this study.",

Materials and Methods: We retrospectively evaluated 81 pediatric patients who had sclerotherapy in our department over a 14-year period. Patients with a diagnosis of low-flow vascular malformation, pre and post-treatment ultrasound (US) and clinical follow-up evaluation were included in the study. Exclusion criteria were coexisting high-flow vascular malformations, history of additional surgical or medical treatment to their malformation and large infiltrative lesions difficult to measure on US. Pre and post-treatment sonographic volumes of the malformation were assessed. Changes in volume were categorized into 6- increased volume, stable and volume decrease of 1-25%/26-50%/51-75%/75-100%. Clinical outcomes were categorized into 4 - worse, no change, improved and symptom free. In cases where pre-treatment MRI was available, the estimated malformation volumes in both modalities were correlated using Spearman's rank correlation. The change in sonographic volume was correlated with clinical outcome using Spearman's rank correlation. P-values < .05 were considered significant. Results: Twenty-nine patients were included in the study; 13 with venous malformation (VM), and 16 with lymphatic malformation (LM). Nineteen patients had both pre-treatment US and MRI, showing correlation in volume between the 2 modalities (P < .001). Post-treatment change in volume correlated with clinical outcome for combined venous and LMs (rho = .44, P = .02). No correlation was found when venous (rho = .48, P = .09) and lymphatic (rho = .33, P = .21) malformations were considered separately. Conclusion: Ultrasound can potentially be used as an objective tool in evaluating sclerotherapy treatment response of low-flow vascular malformations in the pediatric population.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Patients born with bilateral head and neck lymphatic malformations (BHNLMs) often require multiple invasive treatments, including tracheostomy. We hypothesized that primary targeted medical therapy (pTMT) with diagnostic needle aspiration reduces the need for invasive therapy such as surgical resection and/or sclerotherapy. METHODS: Retrospective case review was performed of infants with BHNLMs (Grade 2 or De Serres stage IV and V) treated only at our institution from 2000 to 2021. Patients were divided into two cohorts: those managed with pTMT and those managed with observation, sclerotherapy, or surgical intervention (non-pTMT). Data regarding interventions, clinical outcomes, morbidity, and mortality were analyzed with descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Nine children with BHNLMs met inclusion criteria. Three (33%) were in the pTMT cohort and six (66%) were non-pTMT. Eight (89%) malformations were genotyped, and all demonstrated hotspot PIK3CA variants. All pTMT patients had sirolimus initiated in the first month of life and underwent needle aspiration of malformation cyst fluid for cell-free DNA samples. All pTMT patients tolerated medical therapy. For the non-pTMT cohort, primary treatment included none (deceased, n = 1, 17%), observation with needle aspiration (n = 1, 17%), surgical resection (n = 2, 33%), or combination surgery and sclerotherapy (n = 2, 33%). Intubation duration, intensive care and initial hospital length of stay were not different between cohorts. Four non-pTMT patients (67%) required tracheostomy, and two (33%) died prior to discharge. All pTMT patients survived and none required tracheostomy. Non-pTMT patients required a median of two invasive therapies prior to discharge (IQR 1-4) and a mean total of 13 over the course of their lifetime (IQR 1-16), compared to the pTMT group who did not require any lifetime invasive therapy, even after initial pTMT and discharge home. CONCLUSION: This study compares patients with BHNLMs (Grade 2) treated with pTMT versus those treated with observation or invasive therapy. Patients treated with pTMT required no surgical or invasive procedural treatment of their malformations, no tracheostomy placement, no unplanned readmissions after discharge, and had no mortalities. Needle aspiration was useful as a therapeutic adjunct for cell-free DNA diagnosis of PIK3CA variants, which guided TMT.",

Prenatal diagnosis facilitates safe delivery with pre- and perinatal airway assessment and management and Ex-Utero-Intrapartum-Treatment (EXIT) if necessary. Fetoscopic airway evaluation can optimize the selection of patients in need of an EXIT procedure. METHODS: Description of 11 consecutive fetuses, born with a potential airway obstruction between 1999 and 2011 and treated at the University Hospitals Leuven, with a long-term follow-up until 2018. An algorithm including fetoscopic airway evaluation is presented. RESULTS: In utero imaging revealed seven teratomas, one fourth branchial pouch cyst, one thymopharyngeal duct remnant, one lymphatic malformation and one laryngeal atresia. A multidisciplinary team could avoid EXIT in eight patients by ultrasonographic (n = 2) or fetoscopic (n = 6) documentation of accessible airways. Three patients needed an EXIT-to-airway-procedure. Neonatal surgery included tracheostomy during EXIT (n = 2) and resection of teratoma (n = 7) or branchiogenic pathology (n = 3). All patients do well at long-term (minimum 54 months) follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Combining prenatal imaging and perinatal fetoscopy, EXIT-procedure and neonatal surgery yields an optimal long-term outcome in these complex patients. Fetoscopy can dramatically reduce the number of EXIT-procedures.",

Logically reducing HNLM ITs should reduce treatment risk. We tested whether delaying HNLM ITs reduces total IT number. MATERIALS: Consecutive HNLM patients (n = 199) between 2010 and 2017, aged 0-18 years. METHODS: ITs (surgery or sclerotherapy) were offered for persistent or dysfunction causing HNLMs. Treatment effectiveness categorized by IT number: optimal (0-1), acceptable (2-5), or suboptimal (>5). Clinical data were summarized, and outcome associations tested (chi2 ). Relative risk (RR) with a Poisson working model tested whether HNLM observation or IT delay (>6 months post-diagnosis) predicts treatment success (i.e., <=1 IT). RESULTS: Median age at HNLM diagnosis was 1.3 months (interquartile range [IQR] 0-45 m) with 107/199(54%) male. HNLM were stage I-III (174 [88%]), IV-V (25 [13%]). Initial treatment was observation (70 [35%]), invasive (129 [65%]). Treatment outcomes were optimal (137 [69%]), acceptable (36 [18%]), and suboptimal (26 [13%]). Suboptimal outcome associations: EXIT procedure, stage IV-V, oral location, and tracheotomy (p < 0.001). Stage I-III HNLMs were initially observed compared with stage I-III having ITs within 6 months of HNLM diagnosis, had a 82% lower relative treatment failure risk ([i.e., >1 IT], RR = 0.09, 95% CI 0.02-0.36, p < 0.001). Stage I-III HNLMs with non-delayed ITs had reduced treatment failure risk compared with IV-V (RR = 0.47, 95% CI 0.33-0.66, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Observation and delayed IT in stage I-III HNLM (\"Grade 1\") is safe and reduces IT (i.e., <=1 IT). Stage IV-V HNLMs (\"Grade 2\") with early IT have a greater risk of multiple ITs.

Treatment depends on their characteristics: surgery, sclerotherapy, both combined, systemic treatment or observation. This study aims to analyze the surgical and interventional management of LMs in children over the last two decades in our university hospital. METHODS: Management of children born with LMs between 2000 and 2019 was reviewed. Parameters collected were: malformation characteristics, type of treatment, symptoms, imaging, timing of diagnosis and first treatment, number of interventions, recovery rate, complications and length of stay. RESULTS: Files of 48 children were reviewed: 27 with macrocystic and 21 with microcystic LMs. There was no statistically significant difference in type of treatment except for combined treatment, more performed in microcystic LMs (p = 0.04). Symptoms, imaging, timing of diagnosis and first treatment, number of interventions and complications were not statistically significant. Overall, the number of surgeries was lower than sclerotherapies (p = 0.04). Recovery rate after surgery was higher in macrocystic LMs (p = 0.01). Complications and length of stay were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: A good rate of recovery was observed when surgery was performed, with no significant increase in complications and length of stay. A prospective study will be determinant to create a decisional algorithm for children with LMs.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Severe congenital chylothorax (SCC) may result in respiratory failure, malnutrition, immunodeficiency, and sepsis. Although typically managed with bowel rest, parenteral nutrition, and octreotide, persistent chylothoraces require surgical management. At our institution, a pleurectomy, unilateral or bilateral, in combination with mechanical pleurodesis and thoracic duct ligation is performed for SCC, and we describe our approach and outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed over 15-year period neonatal patients with SCC managed surgically with pleurectomy after medical therapy was unsuccessful. Patients were divided into two groups: those who underwent pleurectomy within 28 d of diagnosis (early group) and those who underwent pleurectomy after 28 d (late group). Resolution of chylothorax was defined by the absence of clinical symptoms as well as absent or minimal pleural effusion on chest X-ray. RESULTS: Of 40 patients diagnosed with SCC over the study period, 15 underwent pleurectomy, eight early [mean time to operation = 20 (IQR 17, 23) d] and 7 late [59 (42, 75) d, P = 0.001]. Overall survival was 67% (10 of 15). Seven of 8 (88%) neonates who underwent early pleurectomy survived versus 3 of 7 (43%) who underwent late pleurectomy (P = 0.07). Length of stay was lower in the early group than the late group [73 (57, 79) versus 102 (109, 213) d, P = 0.05]. All patients who survived to discharge had resolution of their chylothorax. CONCLUSIONS: Pleurectomy with mechanical pleurodesis and thoracic duct ligation is effective in the management of severe congenital chylothorax. When performed earlier, pleurectomy for severe congenital chylothorax may be associated with improved survival and shorter hospital length of stay.",

Open surgery, sclerotherapy and various pharmaceutical agents have been described to manage these lesions. However, when such lesions involve the retropharyngeal space with evidence of airway compromise, none of the above aforementioned modalities has shown superior result without repeated imaging and procedures. We describe the use of radiofrequency ablation (Coblation) in an endoscopic-assisted, transoral approach as a one-off treatment for pediatric retropharyngeal lymphatic malformations. METHODS: Six patients with retropharyngeal lymphatic malformations, presented with airway compromise, were treated with endoscopic-assisted, transoral submucosal coblation in our unit between April 2015 to August 2018. We retrospectively reviewed their medical records, imaging and endoscopic findings. RESULTS: Five out of our six patients had LMs involving only the retropharyngeal space, who received the coblation as their sole treatment. One patient with extensive LMs involving multiple neck compartments received coblation to the retropharyngeal part as an adjunct procedure. The average operation time was 62.8 min, and the average intraoperative blood loss was 3.8 ml. All patients were safely extubated immediately after the surgery. None required admission to pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), nor prolonged dysphagia reported. They were observed for 2-5 days post operatively. The average follow up was 28 months (1-5 years) and none required re-operation to date. CONCLUSIONS: We presented our approach and outcome of 6 children with endoscopic-assisted, transoral submucosal coblation to retropharyngeal lymphatic malformation. We believe it is a safe and effective primary treatment to these patients, and a possible adjunct to complex vascular malformation involving multiple sites.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lymphatic anomalies (LAs) include several disorders in which abnormal lymphatic tissue invades the neck, chest, and various organs. Progressive cases may result in lethal outcomes and have proven difficult to treat. Sirolimus is showing promising results in the management of vascular anomalies. We examined the efficacy and safety of sirolimus treatment in patients with progressive LAs. METHODS: All patients with LAs treated with sirolimus from May 2015 to September 2018 were included. They received oral sirolimus once a day and the dose was adjusted so that the trough concentration remained within 5-15 ng/mL. We prospectively reviewed the response to drugs (the response rate of radiological volumetric change of the target lesion), severity scores, reported quality of life (QOL), and adverse effects at 6 months after administration. RESULTS: Twenty patients (five with cystic lymphatic malformation (LM), three with kaposiform lymphangiomatosis, three with generalized lymphatic anomaly, six with Gorham-Stout disease, and three with central conducting lymphatic anomaly) were treated with sirolimus at our institution. Fifty percent of patients (10/20) demonstrated a partial response by a radiological examination and a significant improvement in disease severity and QOL scores (P = 0.0020 and P = 0.0117, respectively). Ten patients who had no reduction in lesion size (stable disease group) showed no significant improvement in disease severity and QOL scores. Eighty percent of patients (16/20) had side effects, such as stomatitis, infection, and hyperlipidemia. CONCLUSIONS: Sirolimus impacts the reduction of the lymphatic tissue volume of LMs and could lead to improvement in clinical symptoms and QOL.

They deform local anatomy and can be life-threatening if they compress the aerodigestive tract or other vital structures. Significant progress has been made in the treatment of LMs in the past 20 years. We conducted a systematic review of the literature on the management of LMs. METHODS: On September 21, 2020, we searched PubMed/MEDLINE for studies published from 2000 to 2020 reporting outcomes of invasive and pharmacologic treatment of LMs. RESULTS: A total of 251 studies met the eligibility criteria. Surgery has continued to be a mainstay in the management of LMs, especially in the treatment of microcystic and mixed lesions. Sclerotherapy has emerged as a first-line treatment of macrocystic LMs and as an adjunctive therapy used in combination with surgery for other lesions. Sirolimus, a strong inhibitor of mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin), has shown tremendous promise in the treatment of LMs, as both an oral and a topical agent. Recent investigations have shown the potential of targeted small molecule modulators of cellular pathways in the treatment of LMs. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple invasive and pharmacologic therapies have been shown to be effective in the treatment of LMs. Future research should focus on rigorous, prospective comparisons of these treatment modalities.",

Although typically managed with bowel rest, parenteral nutrition, and octreotide, persistent chylothoraces require surgical management. At our institution, a pleurectomy, unilateral or bilateral, in combination with mechanical pleurodesis and thoracic duct ligation is performed for SCC, and we describe our approach and outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed over 15-year period neonatal patients with SCC managed surgically with pleurectomy after medical therapy was unsuccessful. Patients were divided into two groups: those who underwent pleurectomy within 28 d of diagnosis (early group) and those who underwent pleurectomy after 28 d (late group). Resolution of chylothorax was defined by the absence of clinical symptoms as well as absent or minimal pleural effusion on chest X-ray. RESULTS: Of 40 patients diagnosed with SCC over the study period, 15 underwent pleurectomy, eight early [mean time to operation = 20 (IQR 17, 23) d] and 7 late [59 (42, 75) d, P = 0.001]. Overall survival was 67% (10 of 15). Seven of 8 (88%) neonates who underwent early pleurectomy survived versus 3 of 7 (43%) who underwent late pleurectomy (P = 0.07). Length of stay was lower in the early group than the late group [73 (57, 79) versus 102 (109, 213) d, P = 0.05]. All patients who survived to discharge had resolution of their chylothorax. CONCLUSIONS: Pleurectomy with mechanical pleurodesis and thoracic duct ligation is effective in the management of severe congenital chylothorax. When performed earlier, pleurectomy for severe congenital chylothorax may be associated with improved survival and shorter hospital length of stay.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-seven consecutive patients with head and neck LM who underwent doxycycline sclerotherapy from 2010 to 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. Pre- and peri-interventional data collection included patients' demographics, clinical and radiological presentation, number of treatment procedures, amount of doxycycline used for each session of sclerotherapy. Postinterventional clinical outcome data were assessed based on the electronic, medical reports with special attention to clinical improvement, measurement of the lesion on ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging after the last session of sclerotherapy and complications of sclerotherapy. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients underwent a mean of four doxycycline sclerotherapy sessions (range 1-23). The mean total dose of injected doxycycline per session was 170 mg. Maximal diameter of the LM decreased from mean 59.7 mm (median 58 mm; 25-130 mm) before treatment to mean of 29.6 mm (median 30 mm; 0 mm 64 mm) after the last session (P < 0.0001). Over a mean follow-up period of 40 months, complete or incomplete disappearance of symptoms was found in 23 (85%) and 3 (11%) of patients, respectively. In one patient, sclerotherapy did not result in better clinical outcome. Two out of 27 patients presented with minor post-procedural complications, and one patient with a post-procedural intralesional bleeding considered as a major complication. CONCLUSION: Ultrasound-guided, percutaneous doxycycline sclerotherapy is a safe and effective method of managing symptomatic LM of the head and neck.",

They are classified as macrocystic, microcystic or combination macrocystic and microcystic. Surgical resection, percutaneous sclerotherapy, and medical therapy are all employed to treat these complex and often symptomatic lesions. No standardized treatment algorithm exists currently. The purpose of this study was to establish a multidisciplinary treatment approach to abdominal LMs. METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted from 2013 to 2019 on patients with abdominal LMs at a single tertiary children's hospital vascular anomalies center. Demographics, imaging, and treatment modality were recorded. Clinical and/or radiographic response to the primary treatment modality as well as complications was the outcomes measured. RESULTS: Nineteen patients (12 macrocystic, 5 microcystic and 2 combined) were identified, with a median age at diagnosis of 2.2 years (range 0.1-20.8 years). Sclerotherapy was the most common primary treatment, followed by surgical resection and sirolimus. No difference in clinical response (p = 0.58) or complications (p = 0.31) was observed based on primary treatment or subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our institutional experience, we propose an LM subtype-based treatment algorithm for abdominal LMs. It employs a multidisciplinary approach, and results in satisfactory patient outcomes with minimal complications.

Materials and Methods: We retrospectively evaluated 81 pediatric patients who had sclerotherapy in our department over a 14-year period. Patients with a diagnosis of low-flow vascular malformation, pre and post-treatment ultrasound (US) and clinical follow-up evaluation were included in the study. Exclusion criteria were coexisting high-flow vascular malformations, history of additional surgical or medical treatment to their malformation and large infiltrative lesions difficult to measure on US. Pre and post-treatment sonographic volumes of the malformation were assessed. Changes in volume were categorized into 6- increased volume, stable and volume decrease of 1-25%/26-50%/51-75%/75-100%. Clinical outcomes were categorized into 4 - worse, no change, improved and symptom free. In cases where pre-treatment MRI was available, the estimated malformation volumes in both modalities were correlated using Spearman's rank correlation. The change in sonographic volume was correlated with clinical outcome using Spearman's rank correlation. P-values < .05 were considered significant. Results: Twenty-nine patients were included in the study; 13 with venous malformation (VM), and 16 with lymphatic malformation (LM). Nineteen patients had both pre-treatment US and MRI, showing correlation in volume between the 2 modalities (P < .001). Post-treatment change in volume correlated with clinical outcome for combined venous and LMs (rho = .44, P = .02). No correlation was found when venous (rho = .48, P = .09) and lymphatic (rho = .33, P = .21) malformations were considered separately. Conclusion: Ultrasound can potentially be used as an objective tool in evaluating sclerotherapy treatment response of low-flow vascular malformations in the pediatric population.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Two-thirds of lymphatic malformations in children are found in the head and neck. Although conventionally managed through surgical resection, percutaneous sclerotherapy has gained popularity. No reproducible grading system has been designed to compare sclerotherapy outcomes on the basis of radiologic findings. We propose an MR imaging-based grading scale to assess the response to sclerotherapy and present an evaluation of its interrater reliability. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A grading system was developed to stratify treatment outcomes on the basis of interval changes observed on MR imaging. By means of this system, 56 consecutive cases from our institution with formally diagnosed head and neck lymphatic malformations treated by sclerotherapy were retrospectively graded. Each patient underwent pre- and posttreatment MR imaging. Each study was evaluated by 3 experienced neuroradiologists. Interrater reliability was assessed using the Krippendorff alpha statistic, intraclass coefficient, and 2-way Spearman rho correlation. RESULTS: The overall Krippendorff alpha statistic was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.89-0.95), denoting excellent agreement among raters. Intraclass coefficients with respect to consistency and absolute agreements were both 0.97 (95% CI, 0.96-0.98), illustrating low variability. Every combination of individual rater pairs demonstrated statistically significant (P < .01) linear Spearman rho correlations, with values ranging from 0.90 to 0.95. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed radiographic grading scale demonstrates excellent interrater reliability. Adoption of this new scale can standardize reported outcomes following sclerotherapy for head and neck lymphatic malformation and may aid in the investigation of future questions regarding optimal management of these lesions.",

A serious long-term risk of intravenous bleomycin is dose-dependent interstitial pneumonitis. Little is known about absorption and circulating levels of bleomycin when used in sclerotherapy for patients with vascular malformations. This is an Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved prospective study on patients receiving bleomycin sclerotherapy in the management of vascular malformations. Depending on the type of vascular malformation, bleomycin was administered either in the lumen or interstitial space of the involved lesion. A bleomycin assay measured serum bleomycin plasma concentrations versus time at seven intervals following treatment. Pharmacokinetic parameters were obtained for each participant and included peak plasma concentration (Cmax ), time to reach peak plasma concentration (Tmax ), volume of distribution (Vd ), elimination half-life (t1/2 ), the volume of plasma cleared of the drug per unit time (CL), and total systemic exposure area under the curve (AUC). Fifteen patients were enrolled (5: lymphatic, 4: venous, 6: arteriovenous malformations). Bleomycin was administered interstitially (IS) in 11 patients and intraluminal (IL) in four; median age of 13 years (range: 2-67). Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed terminal elimination half-life (t1/2lambdaz ) of 88.51 (+-23.09) and 111.61 (+-37.75) minutes for the IS and IL groups, respectively. Vd was 4.86 L (+-6.74) and 1.55 L (+-0.54) for the IS and IL groups, respectively. AUC was 53.9 (+-23.45) and 129.17 (+-93.57) mg min/L for the IS and IL groups, respectively.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies (ISSVA) classification distinguishes between common lymphatic malformations and complex lymphatic anomalies. These entities have overlapping features but differing responses to treatment. Surgery has been the mainstream treatment in intra-abdominal lymphatic malformation, with variable reported success in the literature. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to review the outcome of different treatments for intra-abdominal lymphatic malformations in children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all intra-abdominal lymphatic malformations from 1999 to 2019 in children treated by the surgical team or followed in the vascular anomalies clinic of our institution. Children were classified into one of three groups: group A, isolated intra-abdominal lymphatic malformation; group B, common lymphatic malformation in continuity with other regions; or group C, intra-abdominal involvement as part of a complex lymphatic anomaly or associated syndrome. RESULTS: Fifty intra-abdominal lymphatic malformations were diagnosed; five of these were excluded. In group A (n=28), the treatment was surgical resection (n=26) or sclerosing treatment (n=1), with one case of spontaneous regression; no recurrence was observed in 25 patients. In group B (n=7), three patients had partial resection and all had recurrence; four had sclerotherapy alone with good response. In group C (n=10), therapeutic options included surgery, sclerosing treatment and pharmacotherapy, with variable outcomes. CONCLUSION: The management of intra-abdominal malformations requires a team approach. Sclerotherapy is successful in treating macrocystic lymphatic malformation. Surgery is successful in treating isolated intra-abdominal common lymphatic malformation, albeit at times at the cost of intestinal resection, which could be avoided by combining surgery with preoperative sclerotherapy. With surgery there is often limited resectability, and therefore recurrence in intra-abdominal lymphatic malformations that are part of complex lymphatic anomalies associated with syndromes, or in common lymphatic malformations in continuity with other regions. Sclerotherapy is an effective modality in these instances along with pharmacotherapy.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lymphatic vascular malformations are rare findings in canine patients with six reports available in veterinary literature. Retroperitoneal cystic lymphatic malformations have not been described previously in canine patients and neither has the use of immunohistochemistry to determine their origin, i.e. vascular versus lymphatic. CASE PRESENTATION: An 8-year-old neutered female Cocker spaniel was referred for pollakiuria, dysuria and a painful abdomen. Computed tomography scanning of the abdomen showed a fluid filled structure adjacent to the urinary bladder. During surgical exploration, a thin walled cystic structure with sero-haemorrhagic fluid was found, extending from the retroperitoneal space into the abdomen. The mass was excised and submitted for histopathology, revealing a cystic mass lined by a fibrovascular capsule within the retroperitoneal/mesenteric adipose tissue. The inner surface of the cyst was lined by a single layer of bland, flattened spindle cells. Intramural blood vessels were well differentiated, with perivascular haemorrhage. On recurrence 11 months later, the mass was excised for the second time and a PleuralPort (Norfolk Animal products) was placed. Fifteen months after initial presentation, progression occurred with haemorrhagic fluid in the cystic space, pleural- and abdominal cavities and the owners opted for euthanasia. Histopathology and positive immunohistochemistry for lymphatic markers lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronic acid receptor-1 (LYVE-1) and prospero homeobox protein-1 (PROX-1) confirmed a lymphatic vascular origin of the cystic structure. CONCLUSIONS: To our experience, a definitive diagnosis of retroperitoneal cystic malformation of lymphatic origin could be done only by combining the clinical presentation, advanced imaging, histopathology and LYVE-1 and PROX-1 immunohistochemistry. This is the first report of a vascular malformation in a dog where immunohistochemistry was used to make a final diagnosis. A lymphatic malformation, even if rare, should be added on the list of the differential diagnosis in a patient with a retroperitoneal cystic structure containing serohaemorrhagic fluid. Results of this case report can aid in diagnosis of future cases, however, further studies on therapy and management are needed to provide additional information about optimal treatment of these patients.",

Although typically managed with bowel rest, parenteral nutrition, and octreotide, persistent chylothoraces require surgical management. At our institution, a pleurectomy, unilateral or bilateral, in combination with mechanical pleurodesis and thoracic duct ligation is performed for SCC, and we describe our approach and outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed over 15-year period neonatal patients with SCC managed surgically with pleurectomy after medical therapy was unsuccessful. Patients were divided into two groups: those who underwent pleurectomy within 28 d of diagnosis (early group) and those who underwent pleurectomy after 28 d (late group). Resolution of chylothorax was defined by the absence of clinical symptoms as well as absent or minimal pleural effusion on chest X-ray. RESULTS: Of 40 patients diagnosed with SCC over the study period, 15 underwent pleurectomy, eight early [mean time to operation = 20 (IQR 17, 23) d] and 7 late [59 (42, 75) d, P = 0.001]. Overall survival was 67% (10 of 15). Seven of 8 (88%) neonates who underwent early pleurectomy survived versus 3 of 7 (43%) who underwent late pleurectomy (P = 0.07). Length of stay was lower in the early group than the late group [73 (57, 79) versus 102 (109, 213) d, P = 0.05]. All patients who survived to discharge had resolution of their chylothorax.

A fetal pericardial effusion-like lesion gradually increased the size until it occupied more than half of the thoracic cavity. Thoracocentesis was performed three times, namely at 31 and 35 weeks of gestation, and also just before the delivery for decompression. The characteristic shape changes of the lesion were observed after thoracocentesis. A boy delivered by planned cesarian section at term required respiratory support after birth. Postnatal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which showed a large cystic lesion with septa and hemorrhage without solid components, led to the diagnosis of cLM.

Despite EXIT procedures involving massive resource utilization and posing increased risk to the mother, decisions for EXIT are usually based on anecdotal experience. Our objectives were to analyze prenatal consultations with potential fetal airway obstruction for imaging and obstetric findings used to determine management strategy. METHODS: Retrospective chart review was performed for prenatal abnormal fetal airway consults between 2004-2019 at a quaternary pediatric facility. Data collected included demographics, imaging characteristics, delivery information, and airway management. Our primary outcome was EXIT performance and the secondary outcome was postnatal airway management. Fisher's exact test was used to compare management decisions, outcomes, and imaging findings. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients met inclusion criteria. The most common diagnoses observed were lymphatic malformation, teratoma, and micrognathia. Of the imaging findings collected, only midline neck mass location was associated with EXIT procedure performance. Factors associated with invasive airway support at birth were mass-induced in-utero neck extension and neck vessel compression, polyhydramnios, and micrognathia. CONCLUSIONS: Multidisciplinary input and interpretation of prenatal imaging can guide management of fetal airway-related pathology. EXIT is an overall safe procedure and can decrease risk due to airway obstruction at birth. We identified in-utero neck extension, neck vessel compression, micrognathia, and polyhydramnios as better indicators of a need for invasive airways measures at birth and suggest use of these criteria in combination with clinical judgement when recommending EXIT.

A fetal pericardial effusion-like lesion gradually increased the size until it occupied more than half of the thoracic cavity. Thoracocentesis was performed three times, namely at 31 and 35 weeks of gestation, and also just before the delivery for decompression. The characteristic shape changes of the lesion were observed after thoracocentesis. A boy delivered by planned cesarian section at term required respiratory support after birth. Postnatal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which showed a large cystic lesion with septa and hemorrhage without solid components, led to the diagnosis of cLM. The fluid from the cyst continued to be drained. Neonatal sclerotherapy using OK-432 was effective and the infant recovered well.

Unlike previous studies, this series includes pediatric and adult patients, highlights a single stage partial excision of a complex venous malformation, and describes the first description of using glue prior to resection of a macrocystic lymphatic malformation. STUDY DESIGN: Case series with chart review. SETTING: Tertiary-care adult and pediatric hospital. SUBJECTS AND RESULTS: Four patients (3 males - 9, 13, 25 years, 1 female - 61 years) underwent same day excision of head and neck vascular malformations utilizing immediate preoperative n-BCA glue embolization performed by interventional radiology and otolaryngology, as described by Tieu et al. The indications for resection included bleeding (1/4), pain (3/4), cosmetic deformity (3/4), and discomfort with denture wear (1/4). Prior interventions included none (1/4), cautery and primary closure to control acute hemorrhage (1/4), and sclerotherapy (2/4). Treatments included complete embolization and resection of simple venous malformation (VM)s of the oral cavity/lip (2/4), partial embolization and resection of a complex hemifacial venous malformation (VM) (1/4), and complete embolization and resection of a lymphatic malformation (LM) (1/4). On average, 97 min of anesthesia time was added for the preoperative embolization procedure (range, 94-104 min). All patients had a successful embolization without need for coils. Operative time ranged from 28 to 44 min for the simple cases and was 6 h and 30 min for the complex case. There was minimal blood loss in all cases. There were no associated complications, lesion recurrences, or long-term deficits at an average follow-up of 5 months. The patient with the complex hemifacial VM demonstrated subtle lower facial weakness post-operatively, which completely resolved within two months. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of head and neck vascular malformations with preoperative n-BCA glue and subsequent surgical excision is a viable method for both simple and complex lesions. The safety and efficacy of this technique has been demonstrated in the past in a limited number of studies. This study further supports the use of this technique to address patient concerns such as pain or discomfort and cosmetic deformity, even if the lesion is only partially resectable. In our series a lymphatic malformation refractory to sclerotherapy was treated with a similar technique of glue and resection, following aspiration of the mucoid LM fluid. Our series emphasizes that pediatric vascular malformations carry functional and cosmetic deficits into adulthood that can and should be addressed in this patient population. Therefore, same-day embolization and resection should be coordinated when possible, in order to optimize patient safety and convenience.",

This case series provides a review of five patients, previously treated with sclerotherapy or with a history of multiple infections, who were treated in a novel fashion: single-stage resection using preoperative n-butyl cyanoacrylate (n-BCA) glue embolization. METHODS: We performed a retrospective medical record review of five patients who underwent single-stage n-BCA embolization by Interventional Radiology followed by surgical resection by Otolaryngology, including a review of their symptoms, previous treatments, and post-treatment surveillance, with follow-up ranging from 4 to 24 months after the treatment of interest. RESULTS: All study subjects had unremarkable perioperative courses, and four patients did not demonstrate any evidence of disease recurrence or persistence during the follow-up period. One patient was found to have a small area of persistent disease on post-treatment imaging, but has remained symptom free. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of submandibular lymphatic malformations with n-BCA embolization followed by surgical resection can be performed in a single stage.

This case series provides a review of five patients, previously treated with sclerotherapy or with a history of multiple infections, who were treated in a novel fashion: single-stage resection using preoperative n-butyl cyanoacrylate (n-BCA) glue embolization. METHODS: We performed a retrospective medical record review of five patients who underwent single-stage n-BCA embolization by Interventional Radiology followed by surgical resection by Otolaryngology, including a review of their symptoms, previous treatments, and post-treatment surveillance, with follow-up ranging from 4 to 24 months after the treatment of interest. RESULTS: All study subjects had unremarkable perioperative courses, and four patients did not demonstrate any evidence of disease recurrence or persistence during the follow-up period. One patient was found to have a small area of persistent disease on post-treatment imaging, but has remained symptom free. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of submandibular lymphatic malformations with n-BCA embolization followed by surgical resection can be performed in a single stage. This case series demonstrates that this approach can yield durable relief of symptoms, even in patients whose lesions were refractory to previous treatments.",

Unlike previous studies, this series includes pediatric and adult patients, highlights a single stage partial excision of a complex venous malformation, and describes the first description of using glue prior to resection of a macrocystic lymphatic malformation. STUDY DESIGN: Case series with chart review. SETTING: Tertiary-care adult and pediatric hospital. SUBJECTS AND RESULTS: Four patients (3 males - 9, 13, 25 years, 1 female - 61 years) underwent same day excision of head and neck vascular malformations utilizing immediate preoperative n-BCA glue embolization performed by interventional radiology and otolaryngology, as described by Tieu et al. The indications for resection included bleeding (1/4), pain (3/4), cosmetic deformity (3/4), and discomfort with denture wear (1/4). Prior interventions included none (1/4), cautery and primary closure to control acute hemorrhage (1/4), and sclerotherapy (2/4). Treatments included complete embolization and resection of simple venous malformation (VM)s of the oral cavity/lip (2/4), partial embolization and resection of a complex hemifacial venous malformation (VM) (1/4), and complete embolization and resection of a lymphatic malformation (LM) (1/4). On average, 97 min of anesthesia time was added for the preoperative embolization procedure (range, 94-104 min). All patients had a successful embolization without need for coils. Operative time ranged from 28 to 44 min for the simple cases and was 6 h and 30 min for the complex case. There was minimal blood loss in all cases. There were no associated complications, lesion recurrences, or long-term deficits at an average follow-up of 5 months. The patient with the complex hemifacial VM demonstrated subtle lower facial weakness post-operatively, which completely resolved within two months. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of head and neck vascular malformations with preoperative n-BCA glue and subsequent surgical excision is a viable method for both simple and complex lesions. The safety and efficacy of this technique has been demonstrated in the past in a limited number of studies. This study further supports the use of this technique to address patient concerns such as pain or discomfort and cosmetic deformity, even if the lesion is only partially resectable. In our series a lymphatic malformation refractory to sclerotherapy was treated with a similar technique of glue and resection, following aspiration of the mucoid LM fluid. Our series emphasizes that pediatric vascular malformations carry functional and cosmetic deficits into adulthood that can and should be addressed in this patient population. Therefore, same-day embolization and resection should be coordinated when possible, in order to optimize patient safety and convenience.",

RESULTS: Of a total of 164 patients (60% male), 66% were diagnosed aged <2 years. The median follow-up was 5 (0.3-16) years from diagnosis. LMs were located in the head and neck (40%), extremities (27%), trunk (23%), mediastinum (4%), or intra-abdominally (6%). Types were macrocystic in 47%, microcystic in 21% and mixed in 32%.

                    "abstract": "Introduction: The benefits of breast milk (BM) for infants have long been established. However, for health-compromised infants with difficulty processing long-chain triglycerides, BM is often discontinued, and skimmed breast milk (SBM) is used as a dietary treatment. SBM is usually produced for inpatients in a hospital laboratory. The aim of this study was to determine the viability of skimming BM at home. Case Report: A female infant was diagnosed with congenital lipomatous asymmetric overgrowth, vascular malformations, epidermal nevi, and skeletal and spinal anomalies (CLOVES) syndrome, with symptoms of lymphatic malformation, chylothorax, and pleural effusion. The patient's family produced SBM at home after discharge; the SBM met the dietary treatment requirements and kept symptoms under control. Methods: A nonrefrigerated benchtop centrifuge was used to produce SBM at the patient's home. The optimal setting for the centrifuge was determined and then used to process BM samples from the infant's mother. The samples were randomly selected from each 10-day period over 6 months, and 18 samples were processed in total. The hospital laboratory processed the same samples of BM and analyzed the macronutrients with a comparison of the home-produced SBM to the hospital-produced SBM. Results: The home-produced SBM met the dietary treatment requirement of <1.0 g/dL of fat content.

The objective of this study was to present our series of pediatric patients with vascular abnormalities treated with oral sirolimus, and to conduct a review of the relevant literature. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of patients with complicated vascular abnormalities treated with oral sirolimus in our healthcare facility from 2016 was carried out. Initial dosage was 0.8 mg/m2 every 12 hours, and therapeutic range was 5-15 ng/ml. All patients received trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis. RESULTS: 6 children -3 boys and 3 girls- with a mean age of 9.5 years at treatment initiation were included. 3 of them had head and neck lymphatic malformation, 2 had lower limb venous malformation, and 1 had combined lymphatic-venous malformation at the thoracoabdominal level. They all had received multiple previous treatments without improvement. Following sirolimus initiation, 5 patients had clinical improvement (mean time: 3.6 months) and 4 had radiological improvement (mean time: 6.6 months). Mild and transitory adverse effects were noted in the 3 cases. Today, 5 patients remain under treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Oral sirolimus is an effective and safe treatment in patients with complicated vascular abnormalities. Our results support sirolimus use in lymphatic and venous malformations in which previous treatments have failed, with a good symptomatic and, to a lesser extent, radiological response.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Patients born with bilateral head and neck lymphatic malformations (BHNLMs) often require multiple invasive treatments, including tracheostomy. We hypothesized that primary targeted medical therapy (pTMT) with diagnostic needle aspiration reduces the need for invasive therapy such as surgical resection and/or sclerotherapy. METHODS: Retrospective case review was performed of infants with BHNLMs (Grade 2 or De Serres stage IV and V) treated only at our institution from 2000 to 2021. Patients were divided into two cohorts: those managed with pTMT and those managed with observation, sclerotherapy, or surgical intervention (non-pTMT). Data regarding interventions, clinical outcomes, morbidity, and mortality were analyzed with descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Nine children with BHNLMs met inclusion criteria. Three (33%) were in the pTMT cohort and six (66%) were non-pTMT. Eight (89%) malformations were genotyped, and all demonstrated hotspot PIK3CA variants. All pTMT patients had sirolimus initiated in the first month of life and underwent needle aspiration of malformation cyst fluid for cell-free DNA samples. All pTMT patients tolerated medical therapy. For the non-pTMT cohort, primary treatment included none (deceased, n = 1, 17%), observation with needle aspiration (n = 1, 17%), surgical resection (n = 2, 33%), or combination surgery and sclerotherapy (n = 2, 33%). Intubation duration, intensive care and initial hospital length of stay were not different between cohorts. Four non-pTMT patients (67%) required tracheostomy, and two (33%) died prior to discharge. All pTMT patients survived and none required tracheostomy. Non-pTMT patients required a median of two invasive therapies prior to discharge (IQR 1-4) and a mean total of 13 over the course of their lifetime (IQR 1-16), compared to the pTMT group who did not require any lifetime invasive therapy, even after initial pTMT and discharge home. CONCLUSION: This study compares patients with BHNLMs (Grade 2) treated with pTMT versus those treated with observation or invasive therapy. Patients treated with pTMT required no surgical or invasive procedural treatment of their malformations, no tracheostomy placement, no unplanned readmissions after discharge, and had no mortalities. Needle aspiration was useful as a therapeutic adjunct for cell-free DNA diagnosis of PIK3CA variants, which guided TMT.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To report an innovative endoscopic surgery for subcutaneous vascular malformations and intramuscular FAVA at our center. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Historically, open surgical resection has been the treatment of choice. Recent advances in minimal invasive surgery have led to the successful application of endoscopic resection techniques for the surgical management of diseases of the soft tissue. METHODS: Patients who underwent endoscopic resection of vascular anomalies were included in this retrospective review. Data was extracted from our Vascular Anomalies Center database between September 2019 and October 2022, including sex, age, symptoms, diagnosis, sites of surgery, previous treatment, surgery, and follow-up. RESULTS: There were 13 female and 15 males in the current study, age ranging from 1 to 17 years. The diagnoses included microcystic lymphatic malformation (n=8), Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (n=7), venous malformation (n=6), FAVA (n=6), and mixed cystic lymphatic malformation (n=1). Surgical sites included the lower extremity (n=24), abdominal wall (n=2), the upper extremity (n=1), and thoracic wall (n=1). Five patients had an intramuscular lesion (FAVA). Endoscopic technique used 2 or 3 small ports in a gas inflation fashion. Surgery included thrombectomy, radical resection and debulking of vascular anomalies. Postoperative sclerotherapy with bleomycin was performed via drainage tube in 6 patients with microcystic LM. Technical success was obtained in 27 patients. The conversion to open surgery was performed in one patient owing to the deep location of lesion. No wound-related complication was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic surgery is a minimal invasive, effective, and safe treatment for subcutaneous vascular malformations and intramuscular FAVA. This approach can set a new standard that minimizes wound complications and reduces recovery time in patients undergoing resection for benign soft-tissue lesions.",

Open surgery, sclerotherapy and various pharmaceutical agents have been described to manage these lesions. However, when such lesions involve the retropharyngeal space with evidence of airway compromise, none of the above aforementioned modalities has shown superior result without repeated imaging and procedures. We describe the use of radiofrequency ablation (Coblation) in an endoscopic-assisted, transoral approach as a one-off treatment for pediatric retropharyngeal lymphatic malformations. METHODS: Six patients with retropharyngeal lymphatic malformations, presented with airway compromise, were treated with endoscopic-assisted, transoral submucosal coblation in our unit between April 2015 to August 2018. We retrospectively reviewed their medical records, imaging and endoscopic findings. RESULTS: Five out of our six patients had LMs involving only the retropharyngeal space, who received the coblation as their sole treatment. One patient with extensive LMs involving multiple neck compartments received coblation to the retropharyngeal part as an adjunct procedure. The average operation time was 62.8 min, and the average intraoperative blood loss was 3.8 ml. All patients were safely extubated immediately after the surgery. None required admission to pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), nor prolonged dysphagia reported. They were observed for 2-5 days post operatively. The average follow up was 28 months (1-5 years) and none required re-operation to date. CONCLUSIONS: We presented our approach and outcome of 6 children with endoscopic-assisted, transoral submucosal coblation to retropharyngeal lymphatic malformation. We believe it is a safe and effective primary treatment to these patients, and a possible adjunct to complex vascular malformation involving multiple sites.",

                    "abstract": "Objective:To present experience and evaluate the safety and efficacy of surgery combined with bleomycin irrigation for the management of head and neck lymphatic malformations in children. Methods:The medical records of all patients with cervical-facial lymphatic malformations who presented to Shanghai Children's Hospital from August 2014 to December 2020 were reviewed. 97 children were divided into surgery group(81 cases) and sclerotherapy group(16 cases). Conventional contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) and B-ultrasound examinations were performed both preoperatively and postoperatively. The surgical group received lymphangioma resection combined with bleomycin irrigation. The sclerotherapy group was treated with B-ultrasound-guided percutaneous lymphangioma aspiration and bleomycin sclerotherapy. SPSS 21.0 software was used to evaluate the clinical cure rate and postoperative complications of lesions in both groups by chi-square test. Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate the disease-free survival rate and draw survival curve. Results:In the surgery group of 81 children, 64 cases were cured and 17 cases were effective while in the sclerosis group, 8 cases were cured and 8 cases were effective. Cox proportional risk model found that children in the surgery group had a higher cure rate and a lower risk of 5-year recurrence than those in the sclerotherapy group, with statistically significant differences(chi2=5.814, P<0.05). The risk of recurrence in the surgery group was 35.4% of that in the sclerotherapy group(HR=0.354, P<0.05). In regards to postoperative complications, the surgical group had no higher rate of temporal facial paralysis and other nerve injuries compared to the sclerotherapy group(chi2=1.041, P=0.308). Conclusion:Surgery combined with bleomycin irrigation in the complex cervical-facial lymphatic malformations was confirmed to be effectively and safely. The principle of the surgery was to protect the structure and function of normal tissue while excising the lesions as much as possible. When the lesions involved the posterior two-thirds of the tongue, the floor of the mouth, parapharynx, retropharynx, or hypopharynx spaces. Radiofrequency ablation was used in the surgical excision, which made the surgery more minimally invasive, accurate and personalized.",

They arise due to errors in vascular and lymphatic formation during early embryonic development. This leads to persistent infiltration of lymph fluid into soft tissues and causes a locally invasive mass with pathologic sequelae. Departing from historically descriptive terminology, such as \"cystic hygroma,\" lymphatic malformations are now categorized as macrocystic, microcystic, or mixed lesions, based on size. Advances in imaging modalities, such as ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging, have made accurate characterization of these lesions possible and ultimately allow for early diagnosis and implementation of appropriate treatment based on the morphology of the lymphatic malformation. Management of lymphatic malformations can be quite challenging, and a multidisciplinary approach is most effective for optimum aesthetic and functional outcomes. New discoveries in the molecular biology of lymphatic malformations have provided treatment targets and established a role for pharmacotherapy. Sclerotherapy, laser, and radiofrequency ablation have all proven to be effective as minimally invasive treatment options for lymphatic malformations. Surgical intervention has a role in the treatment of focal lesions recalcitrant to these less invasive techniques. Operative planning is dictated by clinical goals, size, anatomic location, characteristics, and extent of infiltration.",

Eleven patients with massive macroglossia due to venous malformations (VMs) and lymphatic malformations (LMs) underwent incision excision of two-thirds of the central wedge of the tongue; two of these patients underwent resection of lesions in the lower lip or floor of the mouth during initial treatment. In subsequent treatment, three patients underwent orthognathic surgery or resection of lesions in the lower lip and submental region, and four patients underwent one or two sclerotherapies. No patient had complications resulting from anaesthesia or surgery. Patients were followed up at 6 months postoperative, and all signs associated with the lesions had disappeared. The mean follow-up duration was 30.8 months. The aesthetic outcome was excellent for nine patients and satisfactory for two. Nine patients could take a soft diet and two a solid diet.

Few effective options exist in refractory cases. METHODS: Patients aged 0 to 12 months with refractory chylous ascites underwent retroperitoneal exploration after medical treatment and minimally invasive therapies were unsuccessful. The retroperitoneum was completely exposed via left and right medial visceral rotation and opening the lesser sac. Visible leaks were ligated, and alternating layers of fibrin glue and Vicryl mesh were used to cover the entire retroperitoneum. RESULTS: All 4 patients had resolution of their chylous ascites. None required reoperation or reintervention for chyle leaks. All achieved goal enteral feeds at a median of 29 days postoperatively and were discharged from hospital at a median of 42 days postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: Management of chylous ascites is extremely challenging in refractory cases. Complete retroperitoneal exposure with fibrin glue and Vicryl mesh application offers a definitive, reliable therapy for achieving cessation of lymphatic leakage and ultimate recovery for patients who fail all nonoperative approaches.

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Clinical studies have shown low toxicity and a favorable safety profile for sirolimus in vascular anomalies. Here, we describe severe adverse events (SAEs) observed during \"off-label use\" for vascular anomalies. METHODS: We performed a retrospective, multicenter chart review for SAEs during \"off-label\" sirolimus therapy for vascular anomalies and analyzed these cases by a predesigned workflow. RESULTS: We identified 17 SAEs in 14 patients diagnosed with generalized lymphatic anomaly (n = 4), Gorham-Stout disease (n = 2), central conducting lymphatic anomaly (n = 1), lymphatic malformation (n = 4), tufted angioma (n = 1), kaposiform hemangioendothelioma (n = 1), and venous malformation in a patient with CLOVES syndrome (n = 1). Three patients presented two SAEs each. The age at initiation of sirolimus therapy was under 2 years (n = 5), 2-6 years (n = 5), and older than 12 years (n = 4). SAEs occurred during the first 3 months of sirolimus therapy (n = 7), between 3 and 12 months (n = 7) and after 1 year of therapy (n = 3). The most frequent SAE was viral pneumonia (n = 8) resulting in one death due to a metapneumovirus infection in a 3 months old and a generalized adenovirus infection in a 28-month-old child. Sirolimus blood level at the time of SAEs ranged between 2.7 and 21 ng/L. Five patients were on antibiotic prophylaxis. CONCLUSIONS: Most SAEs are observed in the first year of sirolimus therapy; however, SAEs can also occur after a longer treatment period. SAEs are potentially life threatening, especially in early infancy. Presence of other risk factors, that is, underlying vascular anomaly or immune status, may contribute to the risk of SAEs. Sirolimus is an important therapeutic option for vascular anomalies, but patients and physicians need to be aware that adequate monitoring is necessary, especially in patients with complex lymphatic anomalies that are overrepresented in our cohort of SAEs.",

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to review the outcome of different treatments for intra-abdominal lymphatic malformations in children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all intra-abdominal lymphatic malformations from 1999 to 2019 in children treated by the surgical team or followed in the vascular anomalies clinic of our institution. Children were classified into one of three groups: group A, isolated intra-abdominal lymphatic malformation; group B, common lymphatic malformation in continuity with other regions; or group C, intra-abdominal involvement as part of a complex lymphatic anomaly or associated syndrome. RESULTS: Fifty intra-abdominal lymphatic malformations were diagnosed; five of these were excluded. In group A (n=28), the treatment was surgical resection (n=26) or sclerosing treatment (n=1), with one case of spontaneous regression; no recurrence was observed in 25 patients. In group B (n=7), three patients had partial resection and all had recurrence; four had sclerotherapy alone with good response. In group C (n=10), therapeutic options included surgery, sclerosing treatment and pharmacotherapy, with variable outcomes. CONCLUSION: The management of intra-abdominal malformations requires a team approach. Sclerotherapy is successful in treating macrocystic lymphatic malformation. Surgery is successful in treating isolated intra-abdominal common lymphatic malformation, albeit at times at the cost of intestinal resection, which could be avoided by combining surgery with preoperative sclerotherapy. With surgery there is often limited resectability, and therefore recurrence in intra-abdominal lymphatic malformations that are part of complex lymphatic anomalies associated with syndromes, or in common lymphatic malformations in continuity with other regions.

This retrospective cohort study evaluated the effectiveness and safety of a novel combined foam sclerosant: polidocanol and pingyangmycin foam (PPF), for treating cervicofacial macrocystic LMs. Methods and Results: From July 2018 to October 2020, 51 patients with cervicofacial macrocystic LMs were enrolled in this study. All patients received intralesional 3% polidocanol or PPF injections. The outcome was evaluated regarding demographic and clinical characteristics, degree of treatment response, and post-treatment complications. Overall, 16 patients (31.4%) underwent PPF sclerotherapy. All these patients (100%) showed remarkable reduction in lesion size within three sessions. Excellent responses were shown in 88.5% of these patients within three sessions, which is higher than single polidocanol sclerotherapy (80%). The average sessions (duration) of PPF sclerotherapy were 2.5, which was significantly shorter than the single foam sclerotherapy (p < 0.05). Treatment duration was significantly associated with age, lesion location, lesion size, and number of cysts (p < 0.05). No severe complications were noted in this study. Local or systemic complications, such as swelling and mild fever occurred but subsided without any specific treatment. Conclusions: PPF is a safe, and effective combined foam sclerosant for the treatment of cervicofacial macrocystic LMs. This combined foam can improve treatment response and reduce treatment duration compared with a single sclerosant. It can be broadly used if further large-scale clinical trials verify its efficacy and safety.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To evaluate imaging, treatment, and outcomes in neonates with a lymphatic malformation (LM) adjacent to the airway and to evaluate risk factors that can predict outcome. METHODS: A retrospective case series was conducted of ten patients treated between January 2011 and July 2019. The main outcome measures included airway compromise and clinical response to sclerotherapy +- surgery. Categorical data were compared using the Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: Ex-utero intrapartum therapy was performed in four cases, among whom one died due to sepsis. All patients underwent schlerotherapy, with surgical debulking in two. Four patients showed a good clinical response, and five started experimental systemic treatment. Patients with bilateral disease and patients with an LM with >180  tracheal surrounding were significantly at risk for airway compromise (bilateral: n = 6/6 versus n = 0/4, p = 0.005; >180 : n = 5/5 versus n = 1/5, p = 0.048). The need for LM treatment in the neonatal period was indicative of a poor clinical response ('non-responders' 5/6, 'responders' 0/4; p = 0.048). CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that bilateral disease and >180  tracheal surrounding are risk factors for airway compromise in neonates with an LM adjacent to the airway.

As more than half of these lesions develop in the head and neck, LMs can be life-threatening if associated with airway involvement. LMs necessitate a multidisciplinary treatment approach, frequently including surgery and sclerotherapy. We present a case report of a 32-week pre-term male infant with a massive cervicofacial LM necessitating delivery via ex-utero intrapartum treatment (EXIT). The patient was treated with numerous rounds of sclerotherapy, systemic sirolimus, and surgical debulking, but ultimately died at 4 months of age due to acute pulmonary hemorrhage, which may have been related to sirolimus due to the absence of any other associable organ involvement or derangement. We document the patient's clinical course and treatment regimen, highlighting the myriad modalities employed to treat these challenging lesions, and describe a potentially lethal complication of sirolimus therapy not previously described in the treatment of pediatric LM.",

                    "abstract": "We present the case of a 2-year-old male with a complex left cervical venolymphatic malformation who underwent doxycycline sclerotherapy at 12 months of age complicated by new onset pulmonary aspiration. A review of the literature reveals this to be a rare complication of sclerotherapy and only the second reported case. METHODS: Procedural details with associated imaging including endoscopic airway and swallowing evaluation are included. A literature review of cervical and laryngeal sclerotherapy complications was performed and discussed. RESULTS: A 12-month-old male underwent sclerotherapy with doxycycline for a complex parapharyngeal and paralaryngeal venolymphatic malformation. The postoperative course was complicated by new onset dysphagia, aspiration, and decreased laryngeal sensation. Gastric feeding and swallowing therapy were necessary due to prolonged difficulty. The sclerotherapy treatment resulted in near elimination of the cervical components of the lesion at 12 months follow up. The child progressed to total oral feeding by 17 months post-treatment with no evidence of decreased laryngeal sensation. An extensive literature review identified only one reported case of new onset dysphagia and decreased laryngeal sensation after doxycycline sclerotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Doxycycline sclerotherapy for cervical venolymphatic malformations rarely can cause adjacent neural injury resulting in laryngeal complications. Our case report and literature review suggest that symptom management and appropriate aspiration precautions are necessary in infants or children with presumed vagus or laryngeal nerve injury, and injury is likely only temporary.",

                    "abstract": "Background: Sclerotherapy is the first-line therapeutic method for lymphatic malformations (LMs). This retrospective cohort study evaluated the effectiveness and safety of a novel combined foam sclerosant: polidocanol and pingyangmycin foam (PPF), for treating cervicofacial macrocystic LMs. Methods and Results: From July 2018 to October 2020, 51 patients with cervicofacial macrocystic LMs were enrolled in this study. All patients received intralesional 3% polidocanol or PPF injections. The outcome was evaluated regarding demographic and clinical characteristics, degree of treatment response, and post-treatment complications. Overall, 16 patients (31.4%) underwent PPF sclerotherapy. All these patients (100%) showed remarkable reduction in lesion size within three sessions. Excellent responses were shown in 88.5% of these patients within three sessions, which is higher than single polidocanol sclerotherapy (80%). The average sessions (duration) of PPF sclerotherapy were 2.5, which was significantly shorter than the single foam sclerotherapy (p < 0.05). Treatment duration was significantly associated with age, lesion location, lesion size, and number of cysts (p < 0.05). No severe complications were noted in this study. Local or systemic complications, such as swelling and mild fever occurred but subsided without any specific treatment. Conclusions: PPF is a safe, and effective combined foam sclerosant for the treatment of cervicofacial macrocystic LMs. This combined foam can improve treatment response and reduce treatment duration compared with a single sclerosant. It can be broadly used if further large-scale clinical trials verify its efficacy and safety.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Extensive and complex vascular malformations often cause chronic pain and severe functional restraint. Conventional treatments, such as surgery and/or sclerotherapy, are rarely curative, underscoring the great need for new therapeutic modalities. Recent preclinical and clinical data demonstrated that sirolimus could offset the progression of vascular malformations and significantly improve quality of life of patients through inhibition of the Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. The purpose of this prospective study was to assess the efficacy and safety of this treatment in patients with extensive or complex slow-flow vascular malformations. METHODS: Sirolimus was administered orally on a continuous dosing schedule with pharmacokinetic-guided target serum concentration level of 10 to 15 ng/ml. Patients were seen every month for the first three months and subsequently every three months. The primary endpoints were safety and efficacy, based on clinical, biological and radiological evaluations, as well as a quality of life questionnaire. RESULTS: Nineteen patients, from 3 to 64 years old, with lymphatic (LM), venous (VM) or complex slow-flow malformations, refractory to standard care, were enrolled and received sirolimus continuously. After 12 months of follow-up, 16 patients were available for assessment of efficacy and safety: all had a significant and rapid improvement of their symptoms and quality of life. In two patients, sirolimus treatment permitted sclerotherapy and surgery, initially evaluated unfeasible. Sirolimus was well tolerated, with mucositis as the most common (10% of patients) grade 3 adverse event. CONCLUSIONS: Sirolimus was efficient in extensive LM, VM and/or complex malformations that were refractory to conventional treatments and was well tolerated.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lymphatic malformations (LM) are rare congenital lesions with varied clinical presentations, from asymptomatic to life-threatening. Regardless of initial presentation, many are treated aggressively either surgically or medically. There is a scarcity of literature regarding expectant management, this study compares current literature surrounding the outcomes of LMs managed conservatively to a provincial database in which conservative management was the primary treatment. METHODS: Retrospective chart review of all pediatric patients diagnosed with a lymphatic malformation in Newfoundland and Labrador between 1989-2019. In total, 43 patients were reviewed, 2 were excluded due to inadequate follow up, 1 was excluded due to initial life-threatening presentation requiring intervention. Of these patients, 32 were managed conservatively without any intervention, 7 surgically, and 1 aspirated. Data extracted included age at referral, management, complications, clinical regression and patient satisfaction, years of follow up, and recurrence rate. RESULTS: Patients managed expectantly had partial or complete clinical regression in 81%. Anecdotal regression as reported by patients and family was 84%. This is compared to a 45% clinical regression with expectant management in the literature and a recent systematic review with a 48% overall regression rate with sclerotherapy [10,12]. Average follow up was 6 years and average time to regression was 6.6 years. No major complications were reported. Recurrence rate in expectant management was 0% versus 21% in surgical group. CONCLUSIONS: Expectant management is a safe and viable alternative to more aggressive treatments and ultimately leads to regression in the majority of cases. It should be considered as first line for non-life-threatening lymphatic malformations.",

The two most frequent congenital masses that may obstruct the airway are lymphatic malformation (LM) and teratoma. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the results of our experience in the management of giant congenital HN masses and to conduct a literature review. METHODS: The study involved a consecutive series of 13 newborns (7 females) affected by giant HN masses. Prenatal diagnosis was achieved by means of ultrasound (US) and fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Delivery was performed by means of EXIT procedure in case of radiological evidence of airway obstruction. In the postnatal period all feasible therapeutic options (surgery, sclerotherapy, medical therapy) were discussed and adopted by a multidisciplinary team. Twelve patients underwent surgery and one received Rapamycin for one month, with consequent surgical resection owing to increasing size of the mass. RESULTS: The histopathological diagnosis was LM in 11 cases and teratoma in 2 cases. Airway obstruction was solved in 11 cases; 2 LM patients required a tracheotomy because of persistent airway obstruction. Major complications were flap necrosis (one patient) and facial nerve palsy (2 cases). Recurrence occurred in 5 patients. CONCLUSIONS: The management of congenital HN masses is always challenging and necessarily requires an interdisciplinary approach. Current therapeutic options include surgery, sclerotherapy, medical therapy or a combination of them. When they are large enough to obstruct the airway, a patient-centered approach should guide timing and modality of treatment. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV.",

They deform local anatomy and can be life-threatening if they compress the aerodigestive tract or other vital structures. Significant progress has been made in the treatment of LMs in the past 20 years. We conducted a systematic review of the literature on the management of LMs. METHODS: On September 21, 2020, we searched PubMed/MEDLINE for studies published from 2000 to 2020 reporting outcomes of invasive and pharmacologic treatment of LMs. RESULTS: A total of 251 studies met the eligibility criteria. Surgery has continued to be a mainstay in the management of LMs, especially in the treatment of microcystic and mixed lesions. Sclerotherapy has emerged as a first-line treatment of macrocystic LMs and as an adjunctive therapy used in combination with surgery for other lesions. Sirolimus, a strong inhibitor of mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin), has shown tremendous promise in the treatment of LMs, as both an oral and a topical agent. Recent investigations have shown the potential of targeted small molecule modulators of cellular pathways in the treatment of LMs. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple invasive and pharmacologic therapies have been shown to be effective in the treatment of LMs. Future research should focus on rigorous, prospective comparisons of these treatment modalities.",

METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 77 children having LMs who underwent sclerotherapy using polidocanol foam combined with pingyangmycin under ultrasound display from January 2017 to April 2020 was done. The clinical response was graded as excellent (>= 90%), good (>= 50%, < 90%), and poor (< 50%). More than 50% was considered as acceptable response. Prognostic factors were identified by Pearson's Chi-square or Fisher's exact test and multivariable logistic regression model was used to construct a nomogram to predict sclerotherapy response. The discrimination and calibration of nomogram were verified through the receiver operating characteristic cure and calibration plots. RESULTS: The mean number of treatment sessions was 3.1 (range, 1-6). Among 77 patients, 58 patients (75.3%) had excellent response to treatment (>= 90%) and 68 patients (88.3%) had an acceptable response (>= 50%, < 90%). Clinical disfigurement (P = 0.014), skin discoloration (P = 0.040), morphological subtype (P < 0.001) and extent of the lesion (P < 0.001) correlated with clinical response to sclerotherapy in LMs. Sclerotherapy response was predicted through nomogram constructed in this study, which shows good calibration and discrimination. Also, focal lesion and macrocystic or mixed morphological subtype lesion were seen more often in lower number of treatment sessions among the patients with excellent response. CONCLUSIONS: An acceptable response to sclerotherapy using polidocanol foam combined with pingyangmycin was achieved in majority of LMs in children with extremely low complication rates. Nomogram based on the prognostic factors of sclerotherapy response for LMs in children was shown to possess an excellent performance to predict the probability of LMs sclerotherapy response.",

Logically reducing HNLM ITs should reduce treatment risk. We tested whether delaying HNLM ITs reduces total IT number. MATERIALS: Consecutive HNLM patients (n = 199) between 2010 and 2017, aged 0-18 years. METHODS: ITs (surgery or sclerotherapy) were offered for persistent or dysfunction causing HNLMs. Treatment effectiveness categorized by IT number: optimal (0-1), acceptable (2-5), or suboptimal (>5). Clinical data were summarized, and outcome associations tested (chi2 ). Relative risk (RR) with a Poisson working model tested whether HNLM observation or IT delay (>6 months post-diagnosis) predicts treatment success (i.e., <=1 IT). RESULTS: Median age at HNLM diagnosis was 1.3 months (interquartile range [IQR] 0-45 m) with 107/199(54%) male. HNLM were stage I-III (174 [88%]), IV-V (25 [13%]). Initial treatment was observation (70 [35%]), invasive (129 [65%]). Treatment outcomes were optimal (137 [69%]), acceptable (36 [18%]), and suboptimal (26 [13%]). Suboptimal outcome associations: EXIT procedure, stage IV-V, oral location, and tracheotomy (p < 0.001). Stage I-III HNLMs were initially observed compared with stage I-III having ITs within 6 months of HNLM diagnosis, had a 82% lower relative treatment failure risk ([i.e., >1 IT], RR = 0.09, 95% CI 0.02-0.36, p < 0.001). Stage I-III HNLMs with non-delayed ITs had reduced treatment failure risk compared with IV-V (RR = 0.47, 95% CI 0.33-0.66, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Observation and delayed IT in stage I-III HNLM (\"Grade 1\") is safe and reduces IT (i.e., <=1 IT). Stage IV-V HNLMs (\"Grade 2\") with early IT have a greater risk of multiple ITs.

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Lymphatic malformations (LM) are congenital malformations of the lymphatic system, mainly located in the head and neck area. They can be staged based on location according to de Serres and based on different morbidity items using the Cologne Disease Score (CDS), a clinical staging system. In many cases, functional impairment greatly affects the life of patients suffering from lymphatic malformations. The present study aims to analyze a cohort of pediatric patients with LM. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 144 pediatric patients with head and neck LM was performed. Location, type of malformation (microcystic, macrocystic, mixed), scoring according to two different scoring systems and therapy were analyzed. Kruskal-Wallis test was used to analyze the difference in CDS between the patient groups and Dunn's test was used for post-hoc pairwise comparison. RESULTS: The average age at presentation was 6.1 years. The most common sites were neck (47%), cheek/parotid gland (26%), tongue (17%) and orbit (8%). Macrocystic malformations dominated the lateral neck, while microcystic malformations were predominantly localized in the tongue and floor of mouth. Macrocystic malformations (mean CDS 9.44) were associated with significantly better CDS than microcystic (mean CDS 7.11) and mixed (mean CDS 5.71) malformations (p < 0.001). LM in stage V according to de Serres had the lowest values (mean CDS: 4.26). The most common therapeutic procedures were conventional surgical (partial) resection, laser therapy and sclerotherapy with OK-432. CONCLUSIONS: There is an association between malformation type, location according to de Serres and CDS in children with LM of the head and neck. Patients with microcystic and mixed malformations in stage V had lowest CDS levels.",

Unlike previous studies, this series includes pediatric and adult patients, highlights a single stage partial excision of a complex venous malformation, and describes the first description of using glue prior to resection of a macrocystic lymphatic malformation. STUDY DESIGN: Case series with chart review. SETTING: Tertiary-care adult and pediatric hospital. SUBJECTS AND RESULTS: Four patients (3 males - 9, 13, 25 years, 1 female - 61 years) underwent same day excision of head and neck vascular malformations utilizing immediate preoperative n-BCA glue embolization performed by interventional radiology and otolaryngology, as described by Tieu et al. The indications for resection included bleeding (1/4), pain (3/4), cosmetic deformity (3/4), and discomfort with denture wear (1/4). Prior interventions included none (1/4), cautery and primary closure to control acute hemorrhage (1/4), and sclerotherapy (2/4). Treatments included complete embolization and resection of simple venous malformation (VM)s of the oral cavity/lip (2/4), partial embolization and resection of a complex hemifacial venous malformation (VM) (1/4), and complete embolization and resection of a lymphatic malformation (LM) (1/4). On average, 97 min of anesthesia time was added for the preoperative embolization procedure (range, 94-104 min). All patients had a successful embolization without need for coils. Operative time ranged from 28 to 44 min for the simple cases and was 6 h and 30 min for the complex case. There was minimal blood loss in all cases. There were no associated complications, lesion recurrences, or long-term deficits at an average follow-up of 5 months. The patient with the complex hemifacial VM demonstrated subtle lower facial weakness post-operatively, which completely resolved within two months. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of head and neck vascular malformations with preoperative n-BCA glue and subsequent surgical excision is a viable method for both simple and complex lesions. The safety and efficacy of this technique has been demonstrated in the past in a limited number of studies. This study further supports the use of this technique to address patient concerns such as pain or discomfort and cosmetic deformity, even if the lesion is only partially resectable. In our series a lymphatic malformation refractory to sclerotherapy was treated with a similar technique of glue and resection, following aspiration of the mucoid LM fluid. Our series emphasizes that pediatric vascular malformations carry functional and cosmetic deficits into adulthood that can and should be addressed in this patient population. Therefore, same-day embolization and resection should be coordinated when possible, in order to optimize patient safety and convenience.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lymphatic malformations (LMs) are congenital and arise from errors in vascular embryogenesis. LMs are categorized by cyst size as microcystic, macrocystic, or combined. Abdominal LMs are rare. Surgical resection of abdominal LMs has been the mainstay of therapy, but recurrence and morbidity are high. We sought to determine the effectiveness of sclerotherapy treatment for abdominal LM. METHODS: A single-center, retrospective review from 2014 to 2018 was conducted evaluating pediatric patients with abdominal LM. RESULTS: Ten patients were included, n = 9 had macrocystic LM and one patient had combined disease. The average age at first treatment was 6.8 y. The most common presenting symptoms were abdominal distention, pain, infection, and anemia. Preprocedural imaging was performed for all patients; median pretreatment volume was 1572.9 cm3 (range, 67.2-13,226.4). LMs were accessed using ultrasound guidance and injected with opacified doxycycline. Patients received a mean of 7.1 sclerotherapy injections. Complications included intraperitoneal doxycycline extravasation (n = 1), managed conservatively, and LM infection (n = 1), treated with intravenous antibiotics and drainage. One patient went on to surgical resection due to inability gain stable intracystic access; follow-up ultrasonography showed no recurrence. Postprocedural imaging was available in n = 8. Volume decreased by 96.7% after sclerotherapy. The median remaining volume was 0 cm3 (range, 0-599.7) (P = 0.016). Postsclerotherapy magnetic resonance imaging was obtained in n = 6, with complete resolution in 83.3%. All patients had resolution of presenting symptoms. Follow-up duration was 12.3 mo. CONCLUSIONS: Initial results demonstrate that sclerotherapy is an effective and durable treatment for symptom resolution and volume reduction of abdominal LM.",

Complication severity was classified using the Society of Interventional Radiology classification. Clinical response was rated on a scale of 0 (no change) to 3 (good improvement). The sclerosants used were bleomycin (n = 132; 56%), lauromacrogol (n = 42; 18%), doxycycline (n = 15; 6%), ethanol (n = 12; 5%), or a combination (n = 33; 14%). Four major and 25 minor complications occurred without significant differences between the agents. The median response rate per procedure was 2-some improvement-for all sclerosants. However, in pure LMs (67%), bleomycin and a combination of agents resulted in the best clinical response. On patient level, all had some or good clinical response. Mixed macrocystic and microcystic lesions showed a significantly lower clinical response (median 2 versus 3; p = 0.023 and p = 0.036, respectively) and required significantly more procedures (median 2 versus 1; p = 0.043 and p = 0.044, respectively) compared with lesions with one component.Conclusion: Sclerotherapy for (V)LMs in children is safe and effective. Bleomycin is the most frequently used agent in this clinic and seemed most effective for pure LMs. Mixed macrocystic and microcystic lesions are most difficult to treat effectively. What is Known:   A variety of agents can be used for sclerotherapy of lymphatic malformations in children.   Macrocystic lesions have favorable outcomes compared with microcystic and mixed lesions. What is New:   Bleomycin and a combination of agents seem to be most effective to treat lymphatic malformations in children.   Mixed macrocystic and microcystic lesions are more difficult to treat effectively compared with lesions with either one of these components.",

Promisingly, few case studies indicate topical sirolimus as a potential treatment for the lymphatic malformations. Here, we report an 8-year-old girl with MLM on left trunk whose lesions recurred after the surgery that has been performed at 1 year of age. We administered twice daily topical sirolimus at 0.75 mg/ml concentration. After 2 weeks, a local irritation occurred and the dose was decreased to once daily.

The EXIT (Ex Utero Intrapartum Treatment) technique con sists of ensuring the newborn's airway while is still receiving placental support. This technique has not been standardized in developing countries. OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical outcomes of two infants who underwent the EXIT technique. CLINICAL CASE: We present two cases, one with lymphatic malformation diagnosed at 20 weeks of gestational age (WGE) and the second one, a preterm newborn with thyromegaly and polyhydramnios, diagnosed at 35 WGE. In both cases, during the C-section, the EXIT technique was performed with a team of a neonatologist, a gyne cologist, an anesthesiologist, a pediatric surgeon, an otolaryngologist, a nurse, and a respiratory therapist. In both patients, the neonatologist achieved to secure the airway through orotracheal intubation at the first attempt. In the first case, lymphatic malformation was confirmed and re ceived sclerotherapy, and the second one was diagnosed with congenital hypothyroidism which was managed with levothyroxine. The patients needed invasive mechanical ventilation for 7 and 9 days, respectively, and were discharged without respiratory complications. CONCLUSIONS: In these patients, the EXIT technique was a safe procedure, carried out without inconvenience. A multi disciplinary approach and the availability of a neonatal intensive care unit are needed to reduce potential complications and ensure postnatal management.

                    "abstract": "Context: In neonates, iatrogenic hypothyroidism can result from topical or IV iodine exposure. Data on intralymphatic iodine exposure, risk factors for disease severity, and timing of hypothyroidism are limited. Case Descriptions: We report 4 cases of premature neonates with previously normal thyroid function tests (TFTs) who developed hypothyroidism after intralymphatic iodinated contrast. Patients 1 and 2, premature infants with complex medical histories, had chylous effusions and high-volume chest tube output requiring imaging with lymphangiograms on day of life (DOL) 97 and DOL 43, respectively. They developed severe, primary hypothyroidism with TSH of 335.7 mIU/mL (reference range, 1.7 to 9.1) on DOL 111 and TSH of 470.2 mIU/mL (reference range, 1.7 to 9.1) on DOL 68. Patient 3 had prenatally diagnosed fetal hydrops manifesting with chylous effusions and high-volume chest tube output. The infant underwent lymphangiography on DOL 90 and was noted to have an elevated TSH of 13.35 mIU/mL (reference range, 1.7 to 9.1) 4 days later with spot urine iodine of 1742 microg/L (normal, <200). Patient 4 had a lymphatic malformation and underwent sclerotherapy with doxycycline with intralymphatic iodine exposure on DOL 4 and was found to have a TSH of 16.7 microU/mL (reference range, 1.7 to 9.1) 3 days later with spot urine iodine of 228,712 microg/L (normal, <200). The TFT results for all patients improved after levothyroxine administration. Conclusion: Intralymphatic iodine should be considered a major risk factor in the development of iatrogenic primary hypothyroidism, especially in premature neonates soon after exposure. Close monitoring of TFTs is imperative to avoid potential long-term adverse outcomes in this population.",

                    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Lymphatic malformations (LMs) are low-flow lesions resulting from abnormalities in the development of lymphatics. The management of these lesions is complex and involve the collaboration of many specialties. The purpose of this review is to summarize current knowledge regarding the different therapeutic options used in complex lymphatic malformations, analyzing their indications, efficacy and complications. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A search was made using the algorithm: \"(lymphatic abnormality OR lymphatic malformation OR lymphangioma OR cystic hygroma) AND (extensive OR giant OR complex) AND (therapeutics OR treatment) AND (child OR children)\". Of the 120 articles found, 53 were included. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Historically, surgery was the treatment of choice for this type of lesions. However, excision was often incomplete, associated with high rates of recurrence and severe complications. The use of sclerotherapy emerged as a minimal invasive option appropriate in selected cases as a single or adjuvant therapy. Inhibitors of the mammalian target of rapamycin, such as sirolimus, now play a central role in the treatment of complex malformations resistant to sclerotherapy, recurrent after surgery or more extensive malformations that affect vital structures. Other therapeutic options as sildenafil and laser ablation are also recognized as effective in selected cases. CONCLUSIONS: Looking through the literature over the last decade authors realize that surgery had gradually been replaced by less invasive options such as sirolimus with or without adjuvant sclerotherapy. In conclusion, each treatment option seems to have its own indications and characteristics, which must be considered in therapeutic decision and individualized for each patient.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To systematically review current literature on the treatment of lymphatic malformations (LMs) of the head and neck to guide treatment strategy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of literature until 16 November 2021 was performed on treatments of LMs in the head and neck. RESULTS: Out of 9044 articles, 54 studies were eligible for inclusion with 26 studies providing detailed participant data. A total number of 1573 patients with a mean age of 21.22 months were analysed. Comparative meta-analysis did not reveal significant differences two proportions of volume reduction (>= 50% and 100%) between sclerotherapy and surgical treatment. Regression demonstrated that positive predictors for volume reduction were surgery 17 (95% CI 0.26-34; p = 0.047) and treatment of macrocystic lesions 19 (95% CI 5.5-32; p = 0.006). Treatment of mixed lesions also demonstrated a trend towards achieving a greater volume reduction (p = 0.052). A higher de Serres stage of the lesion had a negative effect on the amount of volume reduction - 3.7 (95% CI - 7.0 to - 0.35; p = 0.030). CONCLUSION: This comprehensive meta-analysis demonstrated no significant difference in volume reduction between various treatment modalities at study level. However, individual patient data indicated that surgery and larger cyst types are associated with a significant higher percentage of volume reduction, whereas a higher de Serres stage negatively impacted the amount of volume reduction. These findings can be used for patient counseling and treatment planning based on cyst type and de Serres stage. However volume reduction constitutes just one objective within a more complex treatment spectrum.",

The goal of this systematic review is to summarize outcomes for medical therapy, sclerotherapy, and surgery, and to provide evidence-based recommendations regarding the treatment. METHODS: Three questions regarding LM management were generated according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Publicly available databases were queried to identify articles published from January 1, 1990, to December 31, 2021. A consensus statement of recommendations was generated in response to each question. RESULTS: The initial search identified 9326 abstracts, each reviewed by two authors. A total of 600 abstracts met selection criteria for full manuscript review with 202 subsequently utilized for extraction of data. Medical therapy, such as sirolimus, can be used as an adjunct with percutaneous treatments or surgery, or for extensive LM. Sclerotherapy can achieve partial or complete response in over 90% of patients and is most effective for macrocystic lesions. Depending on the size, extent, and location of the malformation, surgery can be considered. CONCLUSION: Evidence supporting best practices for the safety and effectiveness of management for LMs is currently of moderate quality. Many patients benefit from multi-modal treatment determined by the extent and type of LM. A multidisciplinary approach is recommended to determine the optimal individualized treatment for each patient. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4: ",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To report an innovative endoscopic surgery for subcutaneous vascular malformations and intramuscular FAVA at our center. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Historically, open surgical resection has been the treatment of choice. Recent advances in minimal invasive surgery have led to the successful application of endoscopic resection techniques for the surgical management of diseases of the soft tissue. METHODS: Patients who underwent endoscopic resection of vascular anomalies were included in this retrospective review. Data was extracted from our Vascular Anomalies Center database between September 2019 and October 2022, including sex, age, symptoms, diagnosis, sites of surgery, previous treatment, surgery, and follow-up. RESULTS: There were 13 female and 15 males in the current study, age ranging from 1 to 17 years. The diagnoses included microcystic lymphatic malformation (n=8), Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (n=7), venous malformation (n=6), FAVA (n=6), and mixed cystic lymphatic malformation (n=1). Surgical sites included the lower extremity (n=24), abdominal wall (n=2), the upper extremity (n=1), and thoracic wall (n=1). Five patients had an intramuscular lesion (FAVA). Endoscopic technique used 2 or 3 small ports in a gas inflation fashion. Surgery included thrombectomy, radical resection and debulking of vascular anomalies. Postoperative sclerotherapy with bleomycin was performed via drainage tube in 6 patients with microcystic LM. Technical success was obtained in 27 patients. The conversion to open surgery was performed in one patient owing to the deep location of lesion. No wound-related complication was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic surgery is a minimal invasive, effective, and safe treatment for subcutaneous vascular malformations and intramuscular FAVA. This approach can set a new standard that minimizes wound complications and reduces recovery time in patients undergoing resection for benign soft-tissue lesions.",

Their clinical diagnosis is difficult, and imaging studies are essential to determine the type and extent of vessels involved. Treatment can be challenging and must be managed by a multidisciplinary team. METHODS: A descriptive, observational, retrospective, longitudinal study of clinical records of patients diagnosed with IVMs who were evaluated at the vascular anomalies clinic from January 2011 to December 2021 was performed. Demographic, clinical, imaging, diagnosis, treatment, and response data were collected. RESULTS: Seven patients (five females and two males) with a mean age of 13.66 years (standard deviation 5.82 years) were included in the study. In all cases, the clinical diagnosis was venous and lymphatic malformation. The radiological findings were dilated and tortuous vascular structures or multilobulated lesions with septa inside, with or without vascular flow; these findings allowed diagnosis in all cases. Treatment modalities included sclerotherapy in five patients, surgical resection in two, medical treatment with sirolimus in three, and surveillance in one. Subsequent clinical evolution was favorable in all patients, with decreased pain in six (partial in four and total in two) and size reduction in one patient. CONCLUSION: IVMs in our pediatric population most frequently affect the lower extremities. The main symptoms and signs were pain on exertion and volume increase. Treatment can be challenging given the extension and depth of the malformations, so a combination of therapeutic modalities may be necessary to obtain the best outcome.",

They arise due to errors in vascular and lymphatic formation during early embryonic development. This leads to persistent infiltration of lymph fluid into soft tissues and causes a locally invasive mass with pathologic sequelae. Departing from historically descriptive terminology, such as \"cystic hygroma,\" lymphatic malformations are now categorized as macrocystic, microcystic, or mixed lesions, based on size. Advances in imaging modalities, such as ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging, have made accurate characterization of these lesions possible and ultimately allow for early diagnosis and implementation of appropriate treatment based on the morphology of the lymphatic malformation. Management of lymphatic malformations can be quite challenging, and a multidisciplinary approach is most effective for optimum aesthetic and functional outcomes. New discoveries in the molecular biology of lymphatic malformations have provided treatment targets and established a role for pharmacotherapy. Sclerotherapy, laser, and radiofrequency ablation have all proven to be effective as minimally invasive treatment options for lymphatic malformations. Surgical intervention has a role in the treatment of focal lesions recalcitrant to these less invasive techniques. Operative planning is dictated by clinical goals, size, anatomic location, characteristics, and extent of infiltration.",

METHODS: Medical records of patients who were treated for LM in the Paediatric Surgical Centre Universitas Gadjah Mada from January 2015 to January 2019 were reviewed. Scoring systems were used to assess the outcomes, including reduction of size, problems of aesthetics, functional problems, complications, necessity of further interventions, and interventions' frequencies. RESULTS: During the four-year study, we included 31 children, consisting of 6, 5, and 20 patients in Groups I, II, and III, respectively. The total score did not significantly differ between Groups I, II, and III (14.67+-2.80 vs. 13.40+-2.07 vs. 12.50+-1.47, respectively; p=0.056). Group II scored better in aesthetic problems than other groups (p=0.001), Group III scored higher in necessity of further interventions compared to the other groups (p=0.026), and Group I was higher in interventions' frequencies than the other groups (p<0.001). However, there were no significant differences in reduction of size, functional problems, and complications among groups (p=0.554, 0.151, and 0.076, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: There is no significant different effect of the three modalities treatment for LM, although one group might have more beneficial effects compared with the other groups due to different scoring system parameters. Further multicentre and prospective cohort studies with a larger number of patients are necessary to establish the existence and extent of our findings.",

The frequency and timing of emergency department (ED) visits related to the event were analysed to provide data on efficacy and ideal timing of treatment. METHODS: A 5-year retrospective review of a hospital database was conducted reviewing 35 patients (15 female, 20 male; mean age 3.9 years) with macrocystic lymphatic malformations of the head and neck not involving the airway. Patients treated with oral medications were excluded. A survival analysis was performed comparing the incidence of recurrent swelling of the malformation. A Cox regression analysis was conducted using age, gender, diameter of lymphatic malformation at presentation, and echogenicity on US as covariates. Fisher's test and mean comparisons were performed to correlate the populations baselines and the number and frequency of ED visits between the 2 groups. RESULTS: Thirteen patients underwent sclerotherapy soon after initial presentation and 22 elected for observation. The two baseline populations differed at presentation with the treatment group being younger (1.4 +- 2.4 vs. 5.4 +- 6.3 years, p = 0.03) and with larger lesions (5.7 +- 2.7 vs. 4.0 +- 1.7 cm p = 0.03). Mean follow-up time was 2.7 years. Survival analysis showed 1 or multiple recurrences affected 16 patients in the untreated group and 3 patients in the treated group. (p = 0.04). Age, gender, diameter of the lesion at presentation and increased echogenicity on US were not predictive factors of recurrence. Although the probability of visiting the ED at least once did not differ between the two groups (p = 0.42), patients from the non-treatment group were more likely to visit the ED more than once (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Sclerotherapy treatment may reduce the chance of recurrent swelling or an event after initial presentation to the ED.",

RESULTS: Of a total of 164 patients (60% male), 66% were diagnosed aged <2 years. The median follow-up was 5 (0.3-16) years from diagnosis. LMs were located in the head and neck (40%), extremities (27%), trunk (23%), mediastinum (4%), or intra-abdominally (6%). Types were macrocystic in 47%, microcystic in 21% and mixed in 32%. Sclerotherapy was the most common intervention (38%). Primary surgery had been performed in 12%. Symptomatic improvement, reduction in size, or complete regression were observed in 82/102 (80%) of LMs after interventions; complications from treatment were uncommon (Clavien-Dindo grade I-II: 6%; grade III-IIId: 1%). Sixty-two patients (38%; median age 0.5 (range, 0-12) years) had not required interventions to date; spontaneous regression of the LM occurred in 16 (26%) of these expectantly followed-up cases. CONCLUSIONS: Most studies to date have focused on LMs in selected anatomical locations.

LMs were located in the head and neck (40%), extremities (27%), trunk (23%), mediastinum (4%), or intra-abdominally (6%). Types were macrocystic in 47%, microcystic in 21% and mixed in 32%. Sclerotherapy was the most common intervention (38%). Primary surgery had been performed in 12%. Symptomatic improvement, reduction in size, or complete regression were observed in 82/102 (80%) of LMs after interventions; complications from treatment were uncommon (Clavien-Dindo grade I-II: 6%; grade III-IIId: 1%). Sixty-two patients (38%; median age 0.5 (range, 0-12) years) had not required interventions to date; spontaneous regression of the LM occurred in 16 (26%) of these expectantly followed-up cases. CONCLUSIONS: Most studies to date have focused on LMs in selected anatomical locations. Herein the outcomes of an entire population from a single tertiary unit of patients are presented, demonstrating the wide heterogeneity of simple (cystic) LMs and highlighting the importance of individualized, multidisciplinary approaches to care in achieving optimal outcomes.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Retropharyngeal lymphatic malformations (LMs) are uncommon congenital anomalies. Open surgery, sclerotherapy and various pharmaceutical agents have been described to manage these lesions. However, when such lesions involve the retropharyngeal space with evidence of airway compromise, none of the above aforementioned modalities has shown superior result without repeated imaging and procedures. We describe the use of radiofrequency ablation (Coblation) in an endoscopic-assisted, transoral approach as a one-off treatment for pediatric retropharyngeal lymphatic malformations. METHODS: Six patients with retropharyngeal lymphatic malformations, presented with airway compromise, were treated with endoscopic-assisted, transoral submucosal coblation in our unit between April 2015 to August 2018. We retrospectively reviewed their medical records, imaging and endoscopic findings. RESULTS: Five out of our six patients had LMs involving only the retropharyngeal space, who received the coblation as their sole treatment. One patient with extensive LMs involving multiple neck compartments received coblation to the retropharyngeal part as an adjunct procedure. The average operation time was 62.8 min, and the average intraoperative blood loss was 3.8 ml. All patients were safely extubated immediately after the surgery. None required admission to pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), nor prolonged dysphagia reported. They were observed for 2-5 days post operatively. The average follow up was 28 months (1-5 years) and none required re-operation to date. CONCLUSIONS: We presented our approach and outcome of 6 children with endoscopic-assisted, transoral submucosal coblation to retropharyngeal lymphatic malformation. We believe it is a safe and effective primary treatment to these patients, and a possible adjunct to complex vascular malformation involving multiple sites.",

Eleven patients with massive macroglossia due to venous malformations (VMs) and lymphatic malformations (LMs) underwent incision excision of two-thirds of the central wedge of the tongue; two of these patients underwent resection of lesions in the lower lip or floor of the mouth during initial treatment. In subsequent treatment, three patients underwent orthognathic surgery or resection of lesions in the lower lip and submental region, and four patients underwent one or two sclerotherapies. No patient had complications resulting from anaesthesia or surgery. Patients were followed up at 6 months postoperative, and all signs associated with the lesions had disappeared. The mean follow-up duration was 30.8 months. The aesthetic outcome was excellent for nine patients and satisfactory for two. Nine patients could take a soft diet and two a solid diet. Eight patients presented normal speech and three presented intelligible speech. Comprehensive treatment including incision excision of two-thirds of the central wedge of the tongue, as well as orthognathic surgery, the resection of lesions in the oral and maxillofacial region, and sclerotherapy, is effective for patients with massive macroglossia due to VMs and LMs.",

METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 77 children having LMs who underwent sclerotherapy using polidocanol foam combined with pingyangmycin under ultrasound display from January 2017 to April 2020 was done. The clinical response was graded as excellent (>= 90%), good (>= 50%, < 90%), and poor (< 50%). More than 50% was considered as acceptable response. Prognostic factors were identified by Pearson's Chi-square or Fisher's exact test and multivariable logistic regression model was used to construct a nomogram to predict sclerotherapy response. The discrimination and calibration of nomogram were verified through the receiver operating characteristic cure and calibration plots. RESULTS: The mean number of treatment sessions was 3.1 (range, 1-6). Among 77 patients, 58 patients (75.3%) had excellent response to treatment (>= 90%) and 68 patients (88.3%) had an acceptable response (>= 50%, < 90%). Clinical disfigurement (P = 0.014), skin discoloration (P = 0.040), morphological subtype (P < 0.001) and extent of the lesion (P < 0.001) correlated with clinical response to sclerotherapy in LMs. Sclerotherapy response was predicted through nomogram constructed in this study, which shows good calibration and discrimination. Also, focal lesion and macrocystic or mixed morphological subtype lesion were seen more often in lower number of treatment sessions among the patients with excellent response. CONCLUSIONS: An acceptable response to sclerotherapy using polidocanol foam combined with pingyangmycin was achieved in majority of LMs in children with extremely low complication rates. Nomogram based on the prognostic factors of sclerotherapy response for LMs in children was shown to possess an excellent performance to predict the probability of LMs sclerotherapy response.",

Microcystic LM within the vagina and pelvis is not easily visible, and there are many side effects of treatment. Lymphangiography, a relatively old method of identifying diseases of the lymphatic system, has been rarely used in clinical settings because of the difficulty of performing this test. In this article, we describe the use of a special lesion site adjacent to the nearby lymph nodes for the treatment of vaginal and pelvic microcystic LM. CASE: Lymphangiography was performed using lymph node aspiration combined with direct local puncture of the lesion, guided by the injection of iodine oil, which can produce a better outcome and more complete removal of the lesion. Finally, sclerotherapy was conducted using a low concentration of 50% ethanol with good fluidity, which covered the lesion to a great extent. This methodology was shown to be effective in treating children with vaginal and pelvic microcystic LM.",

A serious long-term risk of intravenous bleomycin is dose-dependent interstitial pneumonitis. Little is known about absorption and circulating levels of bleomycin when used in sclerotherapy for patients with vascular malformations. This is an Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved prospective study on patients receiving bleomycin sclerotherapy in the management of vascular malformations. Depending on the type of vascular malformation, bleomycin was administered either in the lumen or interstitial space of the involved lesion. A bleomycin assay measured serum bleomycin plasma concentrations versus time at seven intervals following treatment. Pharmacokinetic parameters were obtained for each participant and included peak plasma concentration (Cmax ), time to reach peak plasma concentration (Tmax ), volume of distribution (Vd ), elimination half-life (t1/2 ), the volume of plasma cleared of the drug per unit time (CL), and total systemic exposure area under the curve (AUC). Fifteen patients were enrolled (5: lymphatic, 4: venous, 6: arteriovenous malformations). Bleomycin was administered interstitially (IS) in 11 patients and intraluminal (IL) in four; median age of 13 years (range: 2-67). Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed terminal elimination half-life (t1/2lambdaz ) of 88.51 (+-23.09) and 111.61 (+-37.75) minutes for the IS and IL groups, respectively. Vd was 4.86 L (+-6.74) and 1.55 L (+-0.54) for the IS and IL groups, respectively. AUC was 53.9 (+-23.45) and 129.17 (+-93.57) mg min/L for the IS and IL groups, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences in t1/2lambdaz , Vd , or AUC parameters between groups.

Delivery and transition of the newborns were uneventful. The suspected diagnosis was confirmed by postnatal MRIs, which demonstrated neither associated malformations nor compression of vital structures. Therefore, an expectant approach was chosen for the newborn with the smaller lesion. The other newborn featured a sizeable lymphatic malformation, and due to consecutive head tilt, sclerotherapy was initiated in its second week of life. Our case report outlines the challenges of a rare connatal malformation. Guidelines are often missing. Individual decisions regarding delivery mode, diagnostics and therapy have to be made on an interdisciplinary basis and patients as well as parents need counseling and support over a long period.

LMs are categorized by cyst size as microcystic, macrocystic, or combined. Abdominal LMs are rare. Surgical resection of abdominal LMs has been the mainstay of therapy, but recurrence and morbidity are high. We sought to determine the effectiveness of sclerotherapy treatment for abdominal LM. METHODS: A single-center, retrospective review from 2014 to 2018 was conducted evaluating pediatric patients with abdominal LM. RESULTS: Ten patients were included, n = 9 had macrocystic LM and one patient had combined disease. The average age at first treatment was 6.8 y. The most common presenting symptoms were abdominal distention, pain, infection, and anemia. Preprocedural imaging was performed for all patients; median pretreatment volume was 1572.9 cm3 (range, 67.2-13,226.4). LMs were accessed using ultrasound guidance and injected with opacified doxycycline. Patients received a mean of 7.1 sclerotherapy injections. Complications included intraperitoneal doxycycline extravasation (n = 1), managed conservatively, and LM infection (n = 1), treated with intravenous antibiotics and drainage. One patient went on to surgical resection due to inability gain stable intracystic access; follow-up ultrasonography showed no recurrence. Postprocedural imaging was available in n = 8. Volume decreased by 96.7% after sclerotherapy. The median remaining volume was 0 cm3 (range, 0-599.7) (P = 0.016). Postsclerotherapy magnetic resonance imaging was obtained in n = 6, with complete resolution in 83.3%. All patients had resolution of presenting symptoms. Follow-up duration was 12.3 mo. CONCLUSIONS: Initial results demonstrate that sclerotherapy is an effective and durable treatment for symptom resolution and volume reduction of abdominal LM.",

This case series provides a review of five patients, previously treated with sclerotherapy or with a history of multiple infections, who were treated in a novel fashion: single-stage resection using preoperative n-butyl cyanoacrylate (n-BCA) glue embolization. METHODS: We performed a retrospective medical record review of five patients who underwent single-stage n-BCA embolization by Interventional Radiology followed by surgical resection by Otolaryngology, including a review of their symptoms, previous treatments, and post-treatment surveillance, with follow-up ranging from 4 to 24 months after the treatment of interest. RESULTS: All study subjects had unremarkable perioperative courses, and four patients did not demonstrate any evidence of disease recurrence or persistence during the follow-up period. One patient was found to have a small area of persistent disease on post-treatment imaging, but has remained symptom free. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of submandibular lymphatic malformations with n-BCA embolization followed by surgical resection can be performed in a single stage. This case series demonstrates that this approach can yield durable relief of symptoms, even in patients whose lesions were refractory to previous treatments.",

METHODS: Between January 2010 and September 2021, consecutive patients with retrobulbar orbital low-flow vascular lesions who underwent CT-guided IBI at a tertiary centre in Taiwan were enrolled. Their medical records and imaging data were retrospectively collected. RESULTS: This study enrolled 13 patients (7 male and 6 female patients; age range: 1-57 years; mean age: 25.9 years) with lymphatic malformation (LM, n = 4), venolymphatic malformation (n = 1), and venous malformation (VM, n = 8). The overall radiological response rate was 76.9% (10 of 13); the radiological response rate was 75.0% in the VM group (6 of 8) and 75.0% in the LM group (3 of 4). Moreover, 3 patients (23.1%) had minor complications and 1 (7.7%) had a major complication. The mean clinical and radiological follow-up was 8.3 months and no recurrence or progression was reported. CONCLUSION: CT-guided IBI is an effective and relatively safe minimally invasive treatment for retrobulbar orbital low-flow vascular lesions, with an overall radiological response rate of 76.9% in a mean of 1.5 sessions and a low complication rate. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: CT-guided sclerotherapy with IBI is a relatively safe, effective, and feasible alternative treatment option for retrobulbar orbital low-flow vascular lesions.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The first-line treatment of lymphatic malformations (LMs) is pharmacological or interventional; however, surgery is still necessary in selected cases. Our aim was to identify factors associated with the occurrence of permanent postoperative complications. METHODS: This was a case series study of children operated on for LMs between 2001 and 2021 and followed-up in our institution. Patients who presented sequelae derived from surgical treatment (cases) and those who did not (controls) were compared. RESULTS: We included 112 children who underwent surgery for LMs in different centers. Forty-nine cases and 63 controls were included (58% male), with a mean age of 34 months. Patients younger than 1 year presented more complications than older children, 59% (n = 29/49) vs 41% (n = 24/49), respectively (P = .02). LMs were in the cervicofacial region in seven patients in the control group compared with 30 of the cases (P <= .001), with microcystic malformations the most associated with sequelae (n = 11/15; P = .019). Concerning permanent complications, 88% were neurological (n = 43/49), mainly peripheral facial palsy (n = 17). There was greater postoperative residual disease in controls compared with cases (65% vs 14%, respectively; P <= .0001). However, following a second procedure in the control group, there was no significant difference in long-term cure rates (P = .38). CONCLUSIONS: The risk of sequelae following surgery for LM increases significantly in patients younger than 12 months in cervicofacial and microcystic malformations. Because non-radical resections are associated with fewer complications and an optimal long-term cure rate, we consider that aggressive surgical approaches should be avoided if the absence of sequelae is not guaranteed.",

                    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Lymphatic malformations (LMs) are low-flow lesions resulting from abnormalities in the development of lymphatics. The management of these lesions is complex and involve the collaboration of many specialties. The purpose of this review is to summarize current knowledge regarding the different therapeutic options used in complex lymphatic malformations, analyzing their indications, efficacy and complications. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A search was made using the algorithm: \"(lymphatic abnormality OR lymphatic malformation OR lymphangioma OR cystic hygroma) AND (extensive OR giant OR complex) AND (therapeutics OR treatment) AND (child OR children)\". Of the 120 articles found, 53 were included. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Historically, surgery was the treatment of choice for this type of lesions. However, excision was often incomplete, associated with high rates of recurrence and severe complications. The use of sclerotherapy emerged as a minimal invasive option appropriate in selected cases as a single or adjuvant therapy. Inhibitors of the mammalian target of rapamycin, such as sirolimus, now play a central role in the treatment of complex malformations resistant to sclerotherapy, recurrent after surgery or more extensive malformations that affect vital structures. Other therapeutic options as sildenafil and laser ablation are also recognized as effective in selected cases. CONCLUSIONS: Looking through the literature over the last decade authors realize that surgery had gradually been replaced by less invasive options such as sirolimus with or without adjuvant sclerotherapy. In conclusion, each treatment option seems to have its own indications and characteristics, which must be considered in therapeutic decision and individualized for each patient.",

Progressive cases may result in lethal outcomes and have proven difficult to treat. Sirolimus is showing promising results in the management of vascular anomalies. We examined the efficacy and safety of sirolimus treatment in patients with progressive LAs. METHODS: All patients with LAs treated with sirolimus from May 2015 to September 2018 were included. They received oral sirolimus once a day and the dose was adjusted so that the trough concentration remained within 5-15 ng/mL. We prospectively reviewed the response to drugs (the response rate of radiological volumetric change of the target lesion), severity scores, reported quality of life (QOL), and adverse effects at 6 months after administration. RESULTS: Twenty patients (five with cystic lymphatic malformation (LM), three with kaposiform lymphangiomatosis, three with generalized lymphatic anomaly, six with Gorham-Stout disease, and three with central conducting lymphatic anomaly) were treated with sirolimus at our institution. Fifty percent of patients (10/20) demonstrated a partial response by a radiological examination and a significant improvement in disease severity and QOL scores (P = 0.0020 and P = 0.0117, respectively). Ten patients who had no reduction in lesion size (stable disease group) showed no significant improvement in disease severity and QOL scores. Eighty percent of patients (16/20) had side effects, such as stomatitis, infection, and hyperlipidemia. CONCLUSIONS: Sirolimus impacts the reduction of the lymphatic tissue volume of LMs and could lead to improvement in clinical symptoms and QOL.

We examined the efficacy and safety of sirolimus treatment in patients with progressive LAs. METHODS: All patients with LAs treated with sirolimus from May 2015 to September 2018 were included. They received oral sirolimus once a day and the dose was adjusted so that the trough concentration remained within 5-15 ng/mL. We prospectively reviewed the response to drugs (the response rate of radiological volumetric change of the target lesion), severity scores, reported quality of life (QOL), and adverse effects at 6 months after administration. RESULTS: Twenty patients (five with cystic lymphatic malformation (LM), three with kaposiform lymphangiomatosis, three with generalized lymphatic anomaly, six with Gorham-Stout disease, and three with central conducting lymphatic anomaly) were treated with sirolimus at our institution. Fifty percent of patients (10/20) demonstrated a partial response by a radiological examination and a significant improvement in disease severity and QOL scores (P = 0.0020 and P = 0.0117, respectively). Ten patients who had no reduction in lesion size (stable disease group) showed no significant improvement in disease severity and QOL scores. Eighty percent of patients (16/20) had side effects, such as stomatitis, infection, and hyperlipidemia. CONCLUSIONS: Sirolimus impacts the reduction of the lymphatic tissue volume of LMs and could lead to improvement in clinical symptoms and QOL.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients who received bleomycin sclerotherapy with a syringe pump for microcystic or mixed LMs were reviewed. Cystic components of LMs were accessed under sonographic guidance, followed by injection of an opacified bleomycin solution using a syringe pump (infusion rate, 10-20 mL/h) under fluoroscopic guidance. Imaging outcomes were graded as complete (> 90% size reduction), partial (25-90%), or no response (< 25%). Clinical outcomes and procedure-related complications were also reviewed. RESULTS: Forty-nine patients with 81 sclerotherapies were analyzed. The mean age was 17 years (range 0.1-65 y). Thirty-one (63%) patients had microcystic LMs, and 18 (37%) had mixed. A mean of 1.7 sessions (range 1-4) of sclerotherapy was performed using a mean cumulative dose of bleomycin of 10.8 U (range 1.5-39 U). The mean infusion time was 39 min (range 14-130 min). Regarding imaging outcomes, there was a complete response in 29% (n = 14), a partial response in 57% (n = 28), and no response in 14% (n = 7). Regarding clinical outcomes, there was a complete response in 39% (n = 19), a partial response in 51% (n = 25), and no response in 10% (n = 5). According to the CIRSE classification, no major complications were identified. CONCLUSIONS: Bleomycin slow infusion sclerotherapy provides gradual filling of sclerosant to target microcystic components. This technique is safe and feasible for the management of microcystic or mixed LMs. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 4, Case series.",

Understanding lymphatic malformation natural history is essential. We describe management of head and neck lymphatic malformations where decisions primarily addressed lesion-induced functional compromise (ie, breathing, swallowing) to identify factors associated with invasive treatment and active observation. We hypothesize that non-function threatening malformations can be observed. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series. METHODS: Retrospective case series of consecutive head and neck lymphatic malformation patients (2000-2017) with over 2 years of follow-up. Patient characteristics were summarized and associations with invasive treatment (surgery or sclerotherapy) tested using Fisher's exact. In observed patients, factors associated with spontaneous regression were assessed with Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: Of 191 patients, 101 (53%) were male, 97 (51%) Caucasian, and 98 (51.3%) younger than 3 months. Malformations were de Serres I-III 167 (87%), or IV-V 24 (12%), and commonly located in the neck (101, 53%), or oral cavity (36, 19%). Initial treatments included observation (65, 34%) or invasive treatments such as primary surgery (80, 42%), staged surgery (25, 13%), or primary sclerotherapy (9, 5%). Of 65 initially observed malformations, 8 (12%) subsequently had invasive treatment, 36 (58%) had spontaneous regression, and 21 (32%) elected for no invasive therapy. Spontaneous regression was associated with location in the lateral neck (P = .003) and macrocystic malformations (P = .017). CONCLUSION: Head and neck lymphatic malformation treatment selection can be individualized after stratifying by stage, presence of functional compromise, and consideration of natural history. Recognizing the spectrum of severity is essential in evaluating efficacy of emerging treatments, as selected malformations may respond to observation.

Methods:The medical records of all patients with cervical-facial lymphatic malformations who presented to Shanghai Children's Hospital from August 2014 to December 2020 were reviewed. 97 children were divided into surgery group(81 cases) and sclerotherapy group(16 cases). Conventional contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) and B-ultrasound examinations were performed both preoperatively and postoperatively. The surgical group received lymphangioma resection combined with bleomycin irrigation. The sclerotherapy group was treated with B-ultrasound-guided percutaneous lymphangioma aspiration and bleomycin sclerotherapy. SPSS 21.0 software was used to evaluate the clinical cure rate and postoperative complications of lesions in both groups by chi-square test. Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate the disease-free survival rate and draw survival curve. Results:In the surgery group of 81 children, 64 cases were cured and 17 cases were effective while in the sclerosis group, 8 cases were cured and 8 cases were effective. Cox proportional risk model found that children in the surgery group had a higher cure rate and a lower risk of 5-year recurrence than those in the sclerotherapy group, with statistically significant differences(chi2=5.814, P<0.05). The risk of recurrence in the surgery group was 35.4% of that in the sclerotherapy group(HR=0.354, P<0.05). In regards to postoperative complications, the surgical group had no higher rate of temporal facial paralysis and other nerve injuries compared to the sclerotherapy group(chi2=1.041, P=0.308). Conclusion:Surgery combined with bleomycin irrigation in the complex cervical-facial lymphatic malformations was confirmed to be effectively and safely. The principle of the surgery was to protect the structure and function of normal tissue while excising the lesions as much as possible. When the lesions involved the posterior two-thirds of the tongue, the floor of the mouth, parapharynx, retropharynx, or hypopharynx spaces. Radiofrequency ablation was used in the surgical excision, which made the surgery more minimally invasive, accurate and personalized.",

METHODS: A retrospective case series was conducted of ten patients treated between January 2011 and July 2019. The main outcome measures included airway compromise and clinical response to sclerotherapy +- surgery. Categorical data were compared using the Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: Ex-utero intrapartum therapy was performed in four cases, among whom one died due to sepsis. All patients underwent schlerotherapy, with surgical debulking in two. Four patients showed a good clinical response, and five started experimental systemic treatment. Patients with bilateral disease and patients with an LM with >180  tracheal surrounding were significantly at risk for airway compromise (bilateral: n = 6/6 versus n = 0/4, p = 0.005; >180 : n = 5/5 versus n = 1/5, p = 0.048). The need for LM treatment in the neonatal period was indicative of a poor clinical response ('non-responders' 5/6, 'responders' 0/4; p = 0.048). CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that bilateral disease and >180  tracheal surrounding are risk factors for airway compromise in neonates with an LM adjacent to the airway. In addition, the need for early treatment seems to be indicative of a poor clinical response.",

As more than half of these lesions develop in the head and neck, LMs can be life-threatening if associated with airway involvement. LMs necessitate a multidisciplinary treatment approach, frequently including surgery and sclerotherapy. We present a case report of a 32-week pre-term male infant with a massive cervicofacial LM necessitating delivery via ex-utero intrapartum treatment (EXIT). The patient was treated with numerous rounds of sclerotherapy, systemic sirolimus, and surgical debulking, but ultimately died at 4 months of age due to acute pulmonary hemorrhage, which may have been related to sirolimus due to the absence of any other associable organ involvement or derangement. We document the patient's clinical course and treatment regimen, highlighting the myriad modalities employed to treat these challenging lesions, and describe a potentially lethal complication of sirolimus therapy not previously described in the treatment of pediatric LM.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lymphatic vascular malformations are rare findings in canine patients with six reports available in veterinary literature. Retroperitoneal cystic lymphatic malformations have not been described previously in canine patients and neither has the use of immunohistochemistry to determine their origin, i.e. vascular versus lymphatic. CASE PRESENTATION: An 8-year-old neutered female Cocker spaniel was referred for pollakiuria, dysuria and a painful abdomen. Computed tomography scanning of the abdomen showed a fluid filled structure adjacent to the urinary bladder. During surgical exploration, a thin walled cystic structure with sero-haemorrhagic fluid was found, extending from the retroperitoneal space into the abdomen. The mass was excised and submitted for histopathology, revealing a cystic mass lined by a fibrovascular capsule within the retroperitoneal/mesenteric adipose tissue. The inner surface of the cyst was lined by a single layer of bland, flattened spindle cells. Intramural blood vessels were well differentiated, with perivascular haemorrhage. On recurrence 11 months later, the mass was excised for the second time and a PleuralPort (Norfolk Animal products) was placed. Fifteen months after initial presentation, progression occurred with haemorrhagic fluid in the cystic space, pleural- and abdominal cavities and the owners opted for euthanasia. Histopathology and positive immunohistochemistry for lymphatic markers lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronic acid receptor-1 (LYVE-1) and prospero homeobox protein-1 (PROX-1) confirmed a lymphatic vascular origin of the cystic structure. CONCLUSIONS: To our experience, a definitive diagnosis of retroperitoneal cystic malformation of lymphatic origin could be done only by combining the clinical presentation, advanced imaging, histopathology and LYVE-1 and PROX-1 immunohistochemistry. This is the first report of a vascular malformation in a dog where immunohistochemistry was used to make a final diagnosis. A lymphatic malformation, even if rare, should be added on the list of the differential diagnosis in a patient with a retroperitoneal cystic structure containing serohaemorrhagic fluid. Results of this case report can aid in diagnosis of future cases, however, further studies on therapy and management are needed to provide additional information about optimal treatment of these patients.",

LMs are categorized by cyst size as microcystic, macrocystic, or combined. Abdominal LMs are rare. Surgical resection of abdominal LMs has been the mainstay of therapy, but recurrence and morbidity are high. We sought to determine the effectiveness of sclerotherapy treatment for abdominal LM. METHODS: A single-center, retrospective review from 2014 to 2018 was conducted evaluating pediatric patients with abdominal LM. RESULTS: Ten patients were included, n = 9 had macrocystic LM and one patient had combined disease. The average age at first treatment was 6.8 y. The most common presenting symptoms were abdominal distention, pain, infection, and anemia. Preprocedural imaging was performed for all patients; median pretreatment volume was 1572.9 cm3 (range, 67.2-13,226.4). LMs were accessed using ultrasound guidance and injected with opacified doxycycline. Patients received a mean of 7.1 sclerotherapy injections. Complications included intraperitoneal doxycycline extravasation (n = 1), managed conservatively, and LM infection (n = 1), treated with intravenous antibiotics and drainage. One patient went on to surgical resection due to inability gain stable intracystic access; follow-up ultrasonography showed no recurrence. Postprocedural imaging was available in n = 8. Volume decreased by 96.7% after sclerotherapy. The median remaining volume was 0 cm3 (range, 0-599.7) (P = 0.016). Postsclerotherapy magnetic resonance imaging was obtained in n = 6, with complete resolution in 83.3%. All patients had resolution of presenting symptoms. Follow-up duration was 12.3 mo. CONCLUSIONS: Initial results demonstrate that sclerotherapy is an effective and durable treatment for symptom resolution and volume reduction of abdominal LM.",

Microcystic LM within the vagina and pelvis is not easily visible, and there are many side effects of treatment. Lymphangiography, a relatively old method of identifying diseases of the lymphatic system, has been rarely used in clinical settings because of the difficulty of performing this test. In this article, we describe the use of a special lesion site adjacent to the nearby lymph nodes for the treatment of vaginal and pelvic microcystic LM. CASE: Lymphangiography was performed using lymph node aspiration combined with direct local puncture of the lesion, guided by the injection of iodine oil, which can produce a better outcome and more complete removal of the lesion. Finally, sclerotherapy was conducted using a low concentration of 50% ethanol with good fluidity, which covered the lesion to a great extent. This methodology was shown to be effective in treating children with vaginal and pelvic microcystic LM.",

Their clinical diagnosis is difficult, and imaging studies are essential to determine the type and extent of vessels involved. Treatment can be challenging and must be managed by a multidisciplinary team. METHODS: A descriptive, observational, retrospective, longitudinal study of clinical records of patients diagnosed with IVMs who were evaluated at the vascular anomalies clinic from January 2011 to December 2021 was performed. Demographic, clinical, imaging, diagnosis, treatment, and response data were collected. RESULTS: Seven patients (five females and two males) with a mean age of 13.66 years (standard deviation 5.82 years) were included in the study. In all cases, the clinical diagnosis was venous and lymphatic malformation. The radiological findings were dilated and tortuous vascular structures or multilobulated lesions with septa inside, with or without vascular flow; these findings allowed diagnosis in all cases. Treatment modalities included sclerotherapy in five patients, surgical resection in two, medical treatment with sirolimus in three, and surveillance in one. Subsequent clinical evolution was favorable in all patients, with decreased pain in six (partial in four and total in two) and size reduction in one patient. CONCLUSION: IVMs in our pediatric population most frequently affect the lower extremities. The main symptoms and signs were pain on exertion and volume increase. Treatment can be challenging given the extension and depth of the malformations, so a combination of therapeutic modalities may be necessary to obtain the best outcome.",

A review of the literature reveals this to be a rare complication of sclerotherapy and only the second reported case. METHODS: Procedural details with associated imaging including endoscopic airway and swallowing evaluation are included. A literature review of cervical and laryngeal sclerotherapy complications was performed and discussed. RESULTS: A 12-month-old male underwent sclerotherapy with doxycycline for a complex parapharyngeal and paralaryngeal venolymphatic malformation. The postoperative course was complicated by new onset dysphagia, aspiration, and decreased laryngeal sensation. Gastric feeding and swallowing therapy were necessary due to prolonged difficulty. The sclerotherapy treatment resulted in near elimination of the cervical components of the lesion at 12 months follow up. The child progressed to total oral feeding by 17 months post-treatment with no evidence of decreased laryngeal sensation. An extensive literature review identified only one reported case of new onset dysphagia and decreased laryngeal sensation after doxycycline sclerotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Doxycycline sclerotherapy for cervical venolymphatic malformations rarely can cause adjacent neural injury resulting in laryngeal complications. Our case report and literature review suggest that symptom management and appropriate aspiration precautions are necessary in infants or children with presumed vagus or laryngeal nerve injury, and injury is likely only temporary.",

RESULTS: Indocyanine green lymphography indicated at least one lymphatic inflow in each cLM lesion. Excellent resolution was observed in 87.3% of cases, and good improvement of the treated cLM occurred in 9.9% of cases, and 2 cases with fair outcomes required subsequent treatment. It is noteworthy that no case was treated more than 3 times. Some minor adverse effects, including localized itch and scar, were managed by symptomatic treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Because of satisfactory outcomes and low treatment frequency, ultrasound-guided iodine tincture cauterization combined with intralesional negative pressure represents an efficacious, safe, and feasible method for the management of macro-cLM in the cervicofacial region.",

Treatment depends on their characteristics: surgery, sclerotherapy, both combined, systemic treatment or observation. This study aims to analyze the surgical and interventional management of LMs in children over the last two decades in our university hospital. METHODS: Management of children born with LMs between 2000 and 2019 was reviewed. Parameters collected were: malformation characteristics, type of treatment, symptoms, imaging, timing of diagnosis and first treatment, number of interventions, recovery rate, complications and length of stay. RESULTS: Files of 48 children were reviewed: 27 with macrocystic and 21 with microcystic LMs. There was no statistically significant difference in type of treatment except for combined treatment, more performed in microcystic LMs (p = 0.04). Symptoms, imaging, timing of diagnosis and first treatment, number of interventions and complications were not statistically significant. Overall, the number of surgeries was lower than sclerotherapies (p = 0.04). Recovery rate after surgery was higher in macrocystic LMs (p = 0.01). Complications and length of stay were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: A good rate of recovery was observed when surgery was performed, with no significant increase in complications and length of stay. A prospective study will be determinant to create a decisional algorithm for children with LMs.",

The most common cause is the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak within the spinal canal. Although previously reported in only a few cases, also paraspinal lymphatic malformations causing vertebral bone destruction may occasionally result in CSF leak to these pathological formations. Here, we present a case of a 9-year-old girl with generalized lymphatic anomaly (GLA) presenting with severe postural headache. Radiological imaging revealed a typical feature of cerebellar sagging. Myelography localized the CSF leakage into vertebral bodies of C7 and Th1, which both were partly involved in pathological paravertebral masses of known lymphatic anomaly, and from there along the right C8 nerve root sleeve into the anomaly. As the C8-nerve root could not be ligated due to the risk of significant neurological injury, we attempted image-guided targeted percutaneous epidural placement of a blood patch directly into the foramen at the affected level. The procedure resulted in obliteration of the fistula and regression of cerebellar sagging, with significant relief of symptoms. Although it is an extremely rare coincidence, patients with paraspinal lymphatic malformations may develop intraspinal CSF leak into these pathological formations. The present case report suggests that besides a direct surgical obliteration of the fistula and sacrificing the nerve root, a targeted percutaneous epidural blood patch may be a possible alternative in the case of a functionally important nerve root.",

Sirolimus, effectively inhibiting endothelial cell proliferation in lymphatic vessels, plays a crucial role in iLM treatment. However, the drug's narrow therapeutic window and substantial interindividual variability necessitate customized dosing strategies. This study aims to establish a Population Pharmacokinetic Model (PopPK model) for sirolimus in pediatric iLM patients, identifying quantitative relationships between covariates and sirolimus clearance and volume of distribution. Initial dosages are recommended based on a target concentration range of 5-15 ng/mL. Retrospective data from our institution, encompassing 53 pediatric patients with 275 blood concentration results over the past five years (average age: 4.64 +- 4.19 years), constituted the foundation of this analysis. The final model, adopting a first-order absorption and elimination single-compartment model, retained age as the sole covariate. Results indicated a robust correlation between apparent clearance (CL/F) at 5.56 L/h, apparent volume of distribution (V/F) at 292.57 L, and age. Monte Carlo simulation guided initial dosages for patients aged 0-18 years within the target concentration range. This study presents the first PopPK model using a large Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) database to describe personalized sirolimus dosing for pediatric iLM patients, contributing to pharmacokinetic guidance and potentially improving long-term clinical outcomes.",

Although typically managed with bowel rest, parenteral nutrition, and octreotide, persistent chylothoraces require surgical management. At our institution, a pleurectomy, unilateral or bilateral, in combination with mechanical pleurodesis and thoracic duct ligation is performed for SCC, and we describe our approach and outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed over 15-year period neonatal patients with SCC managed surgically with pleurectomy after medical therapy was unsuccessful. Patients were divided into two groups: those who underwent pleurectomy within 28 d of diagnosis (early group) and those who underwent pleurectomy after 28 d (late group). Resolution of chylothorax was defined by the absence of clinical symptoms as well as absent or minimal pleural effusion on chest X-ray. RESULTS: Of 40 patients diagnosed with SCC over the study period, 15 underwent pleurectomy, eight early [mean time to operation = 20 (IQR 17, 23) d] and 7 late [59 (42, 75) d, P = 0.001]. Overall survival was 67% (10 of 15). Seven of 8 (88%) neonates who underwent early pleurectomy survived versus 3 of 7 (43%) who underwent late pleurectomy (P = 0.07). Length of stay was lower in the early group than the late group [73 (57, 79) versus 102 (109, 213) d, P = 0.05]. All patients who survived to discharge had resolution of their chylothorax. CONCLUSIONS: Pleurectomy with mechanical pleurodesis and thoracic duct ligation is effective in the management of severe congenital chylothorax. When performed earlier, pleurectomy for severe congenital chylothorax may be associated with improved survival and shorter hospital length of stay.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To report an innovative endoscopic surgery for subcutaneous vascular malformations and intramuscular FAVA at our center. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Historically, open surgical resection has been the treatment of choice. Recent advances in minimal invasive surgery have led to the successful application of endoscopic resection techniques for the surgical management of diseases of the soft tissue. METHODS: Patients who underwent endoscopic resection of vascular anomalies were included in this retrospective review. Data was extracted from our Vascular Anomalies Center database between September 2019 and October 2022, including sex, age, symptoms, diagnosis, sites of surgery, previous treatment, surgery, and follow-up. RESULTS: There were 13 female and 15 males in the current study, age ranging from 1 to 17 years. The diagnoses included microcystic lymphatic malformation (n=8), Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (n=7), venous malformation (n=6), FAVA (n=6), and mixed cystic lymphatic malformation (n=1). Surgical sites included the lower extremity (n=24), abdominal wall (n=2), the upper extremity (n=1), and thoracic wall (n=1). Five patients had an intramuscular lesion (FAVA). Endoscopic technique used 2 or 3 small ports in a gas inflation fashion. Surgery included thrombectomy, radical resection and debulking of vascular anomalies. Postoperative sclerotherapy with bleomycin was performed via drainage tube in 6 patients with microcystic LM. Technical success was obtained in 27 patients. The conversion to open surgery was performed in one patient owing to the deep location of lesion. No wound-related complication was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic surgery is a minimal invasive, effective, and safe treatment for subcutaneous vascular malformations and intramuscular FAVA. This approach can set a new standard that minimizes wound complications and reduces recovery time in patients undergoing resection for benign soft-tissue lesions.",

They deform local anatomy and can be life-threatening if they compress the aerodigestive tract or other vital structures. Significant progress has been made in the treatment of LMs in the past 20 years. We conducted a systematic review of the literature on the management of LMs. METHODS: On September 21, 2020, we searched PubMed/MEDLINE for studies published from 2000 to 2020 reporting outcomes of invasive and pharmacologic treatment of LMs. RESULTS: A total of 251 studies met the eligibility criteria. Surgery has continued to be a mainstay in the management of LMs, especially in the treatment of microcystic and mixed lesions. Sclerotherapy has emerged as a first-line treatment of macrocystic LMs and as an adjunctive therapy used in combination with surgery for other lesions. Sirolimus, a strong inhibitor of mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin), has shown tremendous promise in the treatment of LMs, as both an oral and a topical agent. Recent investigations have shown the potential of targeted small molecule modulators of cellular pathways in the treatment of LMs. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple invasive and pharmacologic therapies have been shown to be effective in the treatment of LMs. Future research should focus on rigorous, prospective comparisons of these treatment modalities.",

Prenatal diagnosis facilitates safe delivery with pre- and perinatal airway assessment and management and Ex-Utero-Intrapartum-Treatment (EXIT) if necessary. Fetoscopic airway evaluation can optimize the selection of patients in need of an EXIT procedure. METHODS: Description of 11 consecutive fetuses, born with a potential airway obstruction between 1999 and 2011 and treated at the University Hospitals Leuven, with a long-term follow-up until 2018. An algorithm including fetoscopic airway evaluation is presented. RESULTS: In utero imaging revealed seven teratomas, one fourth branchial pouch cyst, one thymopharyngeal duct remnant, one lymphatic malformation and one laryngeal atresia. A multidisciplinary team could avoid EXIT in eight patients by ultrasonographic (n = 2) or fetoscopic (n = 6) documentation of accessible airways. Three patients needed an EXIT-to-airway-procedure. Neonatal surgery included tracheostomy during EXIT (n = 2) and resection of teratoma (n = 7) or branchiogenic pathology (n = 3). All patients do well at long-term (minimum 54 months) follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Combining prenatal imaging and perinatal fetoscopy, EXIT-procedure and neonatal surgery yields an optimal long-term outcome in these complex patients. Fetoscopy can dramatically reduce the number of EXIT-procedures.",

The EXIT (Ex Utero Intrapartum Treatment) technique con sists of ensuring the newborn's airway while is still receiving placental support. This technique has not been standardized in developing countries. OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical outcomes of two infants who underwent the EXIT technique. CLINICAL CASE: We present two cases, one with lymphatic malformation diagnosed at 20 weeks of gestational age (WGE) and the second one, a preterm newborn with thyromegaly and polyhydramnios, diagnosed at 35 WGE. In both cases, during the C-section, the EXIT technique was performed with a team of a neonatologist, a gyne cologist, an anesthesiologist, a pediatric surgeon, an otolaryngologist, a nurse, and a respiratory therapist. In both patients, the neonatologist achieved to secure the airway through orotracheal intubation at the first attempt. In the first case, lymphatic malformation was confirmed and re ceived sclerotherapy, and the second one was diagnosed with congenital hypothyroidism which was managed with levothyroxine. The patients needed invasive mechanical ventilation for 7 and 9 days, respectively, and were discharged without respiratory complications. CONCLUSIONS: In these patients, the EXIT technique was a safe procedure, carried out without inconvenience. A multi disciplinary approach and the availability of a neonatal intensive care unit are needed to reduce potential complications and ensure postnatal management. Timely prenatal diagnosis is essential to perform this technique.",

Progressive growth of lesions may cause pressure to the surrounding organs. Lesions frequently reoccur after treatment with surgery, sclerotherapy, radiotherapy, and laser therapy. In the last decades, oral sirolimus has been successfully used in lymphatic malformations. Since systemic treatment with sirolimus is associated with various side effects, topical form of the drug has been used with satisfying results, especially for the angiofibromas. Promisingly, few case studies indicate topical sirolimus as a potential treatment for the lymphatic malformations. Here, we report an 8-year-old girl with MLM on left trunk whose lesions recurred after the surgery that has been performed at 1 year of age. We administered twice daily topical sirolimus at 0.75 mg/ml concentration. After 2 weeks, a local irritation occurred and the dose was decreased to once daily. The treatment was stopped at the end of 3 months as the lesions were almost cleared and the patient did not want to continue to therapy. There were no new lesions after 8 months of follow up.",

Many vascular anomalies have a cutaneous component, and thus, we sought to determine whether topical administration of sirolimus may be an effective therapy, as data on the use of topical sirolimus are limited. OBJECTIVE: We reviewed the efficacy and tolerability of topical formulations of sirolimus in the treatment of various simple and combined vascular malformations and tumors. METHODS: Eighteen patients with any vascular anomaly treated exclusively with topical sirolimus were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: Eleven patients had combined venous lymphatic malformations, three had tufted angiomas, two had a lymphatic malformation, one had a venous malformation, and one had a verrucous venous malformation. All (100%) patients reported some degree of improvement and 50% of patients reported marked improvement in one or more symptoms, most commonly blebs and lymphatic drainage, and bleeding. LIMITATIONS: The retrospective nature, small number of patients, and differences in topical preparations limit the broad application of the results. CONCLUSION: Topical sirolimus appears to be a safe and useful non-invasive therapy that is well-tolerated in the treatment of the cutaneous portion of a variety of vascular anomalies.",

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all fetuses who underwent EXIT procedures between 2003 and 2018. RESULTS: EXIT procedures were performed in nine cases. The prenatal diagnosis of the neonates was congenital high airway obstruction syndrome in four cases, the neck masse in five cases. Although the airway management under the EXIT procedure was successful in eight cases, the airway management failed in one case. During the EXIT procedures, the airway was managed by endotracheal intubation in two cases, whereas six cases underwent tracheostomy. Six cases with fetal airway obstruction survived to discharge, whereas three cases died due to airway management failure or complications of the underlying disease. A case with a cervical teratoma underwent tumor resection the day after birth due to rapid enlargement of the neck mass. Long-term survival was achieved in five cases. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that the EXIT procedure was effective and could be performed safely in the airway management of fetuses with suspected airway obstruction. The treatment strategy for the neck masses should be planned before birth.",

METHODS: Overall, 320 patients diagnosed with cervical lymphatic malformation were retrospectively analysed in our hospital between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2017. Imaging modalities included colour Doppler ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, and contrast-enhanced computed tomography. Cervical lymphatic malformations were classified by cyst diameter. Treatments included interventional therapy, surgery, and expectant treatment. RESULTS: Cervical lymphatic malformation was identified in 320 of 1192 patients with lymphatic malformation. Four were excluded due to misdiagnosis by ultrasonography. Cervical lymphatic malformation was classified as mixed, macrocystic, and microcystic in 184 (57.5%), 117 (36.56%), and 19 (5.94%) patients, respectively. Sixty-four (20%), ten (3.12%), seven (2.19%), and three (0.94%) patients experienced intracystic haemorrhage, infection, concurrent intracystic haemorrhage and infection, and calcification, respectively. Among 260 (81.25%) patients who underwent interventional sclerotherapy, 163 (50.94%) received it once and 96 (30%) received it two or more times. Twenty-eight (8.75%), five (1.56%), and 27 (8.44%) patients underwent surgical resection, interventional sclerotherapy plus surgery, and expectant management, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasonography is useful for diagnosing definite cervical lymphatic malformation. Interventional therapy is the first choice for children with confirmed cervical lymphatic malformation.",

Prenatal diagnosis facilitates safe delivery with pre- and perinatal airway assessment and management and Ex-Utero-Intrapartum-Treatment (EXIT) if necessary. Fetoscopic airway evaluation can optimize the selection of patients in need of an EXIT procedure. METHODS: Description of 11 consecutive fetuses, born with a potential airway obstruction between 1999 and 2011 and treated at the University Hospitals Leuven, with a long-term follow-up until 2018. An algorithm including fetoscopic airway evaluation is presented. RESULTS: In utero imaging revealed seven teratomas, one fourth branchial pouch cyst, one thymopharyngeal duct remnant, one lymphatic malformation and one laryngeal atresia. A multidisciplinary team could avoid EXIT in eight patients by ultrasonographic (n = 2) or fetoscopic (n = 6) documentation of accessible airways. Three patients needed an EXIT-to-airway-procedure. Neonatal surgery included tracheostomy during EXIT (n = 2) and resection of teratoma (n = 7) or branchiogenic pathology (n = 3). All patients do well at long-term (minimum 54 months) follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Combining prenatal imaging and perinatal fetoscopy, EXIT-procedure and neonatal surgery yields an optimal long-term outcome in these complex patients. Fetoscopy can dramatically reduce the number of EXIT-procedures.",

They arise due to errors in vascular and lymphatic formation during early embryonic development. This leads to persistent infiltration of lymph fluid into soft tissues and causes a locally invasive mass with pathologic sequelae. Departing from historically descriptive terminology, such as \"cystic hygroma,\" lymphatic malformations are now categorized as macrocystic, microcystic, or mixed lesions, based on size. Advances in imaging modalities, such as ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging, have made accurate characterization of these lesions possible and ultimately allow for early diagnosis and implementation of appropriate treatment based on the morphology of the lymphatic malformation. Management of lymphatic malformations can be quite challenging, and a multidisciplinary approach is most effective for optimum aesthetic and functional outcomes. New discoveries in the molecular biology of lymphatic malformations have provided treatment targets and established a role for pharmacotherapy. Sclerotherapy, laser, and radiofrequency ablation have all proven to be effective as minimally invasive treatment options for lymphatic malformations. Surgical intervention has a role in the treatment of focal lesions recalcitrant to these less invasive techniques. Operative planning is dictated by clinical goals, size, anatomic location, characteristics, and extent of infiltration.",

Cervical masses were detected by ultrasound late in the third trimester. Following interdisciplinary case conferences, a caesarean section in the presence of a neonatal team was the chosen delivery mode in both cases. Delivery and transition of the newborns were uneventful. The suspected diagnosis was confirmed by postnatal MRIs, which demonstrated neither associated malformations nor compression of vital structures. Therefore, an expectant approach was chosen for the newborn with the smaller lesion. The other newborn featured a sizeable lymphatic malformation, and due to consecutive head tilt, sclerotherapy was initiated in its second week of life. Our case report outlines the challenges of a rare connatal malformation. Guidelines are often missing. Individual decisions regarding delivery mode, diagnostics and therapy have to be made on an interdisciplinary basis and patients as well as parents need counseling and support over a long period.

After preoperative and intraoperative indocyanine green lymphography, a complete surgical excision was achieved without damage to collateral lymphatic channels or surrounding tissues.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Large fetal head and neck (HN) masses can be life-threatening at birth and postnatally owing to airway obstruction. The two most frequent congenital masses that may obstruct the airway are lymphatic malformation (LM) and teratoma. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the results of our experience in the management of giant congenital HN masses and to conduct a literature review. METHODS: The study involved a consecutive series of 13 newborns (7 females) affected by giant HN masses. Prenatal diagnosis was achieved by means of ultrasound (US) and fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Delivery was performed by means of EXIT procedure in case of radiological evidence of airway obstruction. In the postnatal period all feasible therapeutic options (surgery, sclerotherapy, medical therapy) were discussed and adopted by a multidisciplinary team. Twelve patients underwent surgery and one received Rapamycin for one month, with consequent surgical resection owing to increasing size of the mass. RESULTS: The histopathological diagnosis was LM in 11 cases and teratoma in 2 cases. Airway obstruction was solved in 11 cases; 2 LM patients required a tracheotomy because of persistent airway obstruction. Major complications were flap necrosis (one patient) and facial nerve palsy (2 cases). Recurrence occurred in 5 patients. CONCLUSIONS: The management of congenital HN masses is always challenging and necessarily requires an interdisciplinary approach. Current therapeutic options include surgery, sclerotherapy, medical therapy or a combination of them. When they are large enough to obstruct the airway, a patient-centered approach should guide timing and modality of treatment. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV.",

                    "abstract": "Objective: To retrospectively correlate imaging findings post-sclerotherapy of low-flow vascular malformations with clinical outcome. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively evaluated 81 pediatric patients who had sclerotherapy in our department over a 14-year period. Patients with a diagnosis of low-flow vascular malformation, pre and post-treatment ultrasound (US) and clinical follow-up evaluation were included in the study. Exclusion criteria were coexisting high-flow vascular malformations, history of additional surgical or medical treatment to their malformation and large infiltrative lesions difficult to measure on US. Pre and post-treatment sonographic volumes of the malformation were assessed. Changes in volume were categorized into 6- increased volume, stable and volume decrease of 1-25%/26-50%/51-75%/75-100%. Clinical outcomes were categorized into 4 - worse, no change, improved and symptom free. In cases where pre-treatment MRI was available, the estimated malformation volumes in both modalities were correlated using Spearman's rank correlation. The change in sonographic volume was correlated with clinical outcome using Spearman's rank correlation. P-values < .05 were considered significant. Results: Twenty-nine patients were included in the study; 13 with venous malformation (VM), and 16 with lymphatic malformation (LM). Nineteen patients had both pre-treatment US and MRI, showing correlation in volume between the 2 modalities (P < .001). Post-treatment change in volume correlated with clinical outcome for combined venous and LMs (rho = .44, P = .02). No correlation was found when venous (rho = .48, P = .09) and lymphatic (rho = .33, P = .21) malformations were considered separately. Conclusion: Ultrasound can potentially be used as an objective tool in evaluating sclerotherapy treatment response of low-flow vascular malformations in the pediatric population.",

METHODS: Between July 2015 and February 2020, 11 patients with airway-compromising LMs were enrolled. To yield maximal effects on the compromised airway with minimal adverse effects, ultrasound-guided intralesional bleomycin sclerotherapy assisted by balloon was performed, aimed at the most responsible lesion around the airway.

The last asymptomatic patient showed airway compression on magnetic resonance imaging. The dose of bleomycin injected ranged from 1.3-9 mg per patient per course. A median of one course was required for withdrawal from airway support, and the median time was 15 days. A median of two courses was required to eliminate the lesion adjacent to the airway, which would have potential risk of airway stenosis. No complications were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our intralesional focal sclerotherapy technique with bleomycin targeting the culprit lesion is dose-sparing, safe, and effective in achieving rapid shrinkage of LMs compromising the upper airway in children, thereby avoiding tracheostomy.",

METHOD: From January 2019 to July 2021, indocyanine green lymphography was performed preoperatively to confirm the lymph inflow, and this treatment was administered in 71 patients with cervicofacial cLM in our center. All cases were evaluated by curative effects, treatment frequency, and adverse events. The duration of posttreatment follow-up was from 12 to 14 months. RESULTS: Indocyanine green lymphography indicated at least one lymphatic inflow in each cLM lesion. Excellent resolution was observed in 87.3% of cases, and good improvement of the treated cLM occurred in 9.9% of cases, and 2 cases with fair outcomes required subsequent treatment. It is noteworthy that no case was treated more than 3 times. Some minor adverse effects, including localized itch and scar, were managed by symptomatic treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Because of satisfactory outcomes and low treatment frequency, ultrasound-guided iodine tincture cauterization combined with intralesional negative pressure represents an efficacious, safe, and feasible method for the management of macro-cLM in the cervicofacial region.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-seven consecutive patients with head and neck LM who underwent doxycycline sclerotherapy from 2010 to 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. Pre- and peri-interventional data collection included patients' demographics, clinical and radiological presentation, number of treatment procedures, amount of doxycycline used for each session of sclerotherapy. Postinterventional clinical outcome data were assessed based on the electronic, medical reports with special attention to clinical improvement, measurement of the lesion on ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging after the last session of sclerotherapy and complications of sclerotherapy. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients underwent a mean of four doxycycline sclerotherapy sessions (range 1-23). The mean total dose of injected doxycycline per session was 170 mg. Maximal diameter of the LM decreased from mean 59.7 mm (median 58 mm; 25-130 mm) before treatment to mean of 29.6 mm (median 30 mm; 0 mm 64 mm) after the last session (P < 0.0001). Over a mean follow-up period of 40 months, complete or incomplete disappearance of symptoms was found in 23 (85%) and 3 (11%) of patients, respectively. In one patient, sclerotherapy did not result in better clinical outcome. Two out of 27 patients presented with minor post-procedural complications, and one patient with a post-procedural intralesional bleeding considered as a major complication. CONCLUSION: Ultrasound-guided, percutaneous doxycycline sclerotherapy is a safe and effective method of managing symptomatic LM of the head and neck.",

Complication severity was classified using the Society of Interventional Radiology classification. Clinical response was rated on a scale of 0 (no change) to 3 (good improvement). The sclerosants used were bleomycin (n = 132; 56%), lauromacrogol (n = 42; 18%), doxycycline (n = 15; 6%), ethanol (n = 12; 5%), or a combination (n = 33; 14%). Four major and 25 minor complications occurred without significant differences between the agents. The median response rate per procedure was 2-some improvement-for all sclerosants. However, in pure LMs (67%), bleomycin and a combination of agents resulted in the best clinical response. On patient level, all had some or good clinical response. Mixed macrocystic and microcystic lesions showed a significantly lower clinical response (median 2 versus 3; p = 0.023 and p = 0.036, respectively) and required significantly more procedures (median 2 versus 1; p = 0.043 and p = 0.044, respectively) compared with lesions with one component.Conclusion: Sclerotherapy for (V)LMs in children is safe and effective. Bleomycin is the most frequently used agent in this clinic and seemed most effective for pure LMs. Mixed macrocystic and microcystic lesions are most difficult to treat effectively. What is Known:   A variety of agents can be used for sclerotherapy of lymphatic malformations in children.   Macrocystic lesions have favorable outcomes compared with microcystic and mixed lesions. What is New:   Bleomycin and a combination of agents seem to be most effective to treat lymphatic malformations in children.   Mixed macrocystic and microcystic lesions are more difficult to treat effectively compared with lesions with either one of these components.",

Open surgery, sclerotherapy and various pharmaceutical agents have been described to manage these lesions. However, when such lesions involve the retropharyngeal space with evidence of airway compromise, none of the above aforementioned modalities has shown superior result without repeated imaging and procedures. We describe the use of radiofrequency ablation (Coblation) in an endoscopic-assisted, transoral approach as a one-off treatment for pediatric retropharyngeal lymphatic malformations. METHODS: Six patients with retropharyngeal lymphatic malformations, presented with airway compromise, were treated with endoscopic-assisted, transoral submucosal coblation in our unit between April 2015 to August 2018. We retrospectively reviewed their medical records, imaging and endoscopic findings. RESULTS: Five out of our six patients had LMs involving only the retropharyngeal space, who received the coblation as their sole treatment. One patient with extensive LMs involving multiple neck compartments received coblation to the retropharyngeal part as an adjunct procedure. The average operation time was 62.8 min, and the average intraoperative blood loss was 3.8 ml. All patients were safely extubated immediately after the surgery. None required admission to pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), nor prolonged dysphagia reported. They were observed for 2-5 days post operatively. The average follow up was 28 months (1-5 years) and none required re-operation to date. CONCLUSIONS: We presented our approach and outcome of 6 children with endoscopic-assisted, transoral submucosal coblation to retropharyngeal lymphatic malformation. We believe it is a safe and effective primary treatment to these patients, and a possible adjunct to complex vascular malformation involving multiple sites.",

The management of these lesions is complex and involve the collaboration of many specialties. The purpose of this review is to summarize current knowledge regarding the different therapeutic options used in complex lymphatic malformations, analyzing their indications, efficacy and complications. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A search was made using the algorithm: \"(lymphatic abnormality OR lymphatic malformation OR lymphangioma OR cystic hygroma) AND (extensive OR giant OR complex) AND (therapeutics OR treatment) AND (child OR children)\". Of the 120 articles found, 53 were included. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Historically, surgery was the treatment of choice for this type of lesions. However, excision was often incomplete, associated with high rates of recurrence and severe complications. The use of sclerotherapy emerged as a minimal invasive option appropriate in selected cases as a single or adjuvant therapy. Inhibitors of the mammalian target of rapamycin, such as sirolimus, now play a central role in the treatment of complex malformations resistant to sclerotherapy, recurrent after surgery or more extensive malformations that affect vital structures. Other therapeutic options as sildenafil and laser ablation are also recognized as effective in selected cases. CONCLUSIONS: Looking through the literature over the last decade authors realize that surgery had gradually been replaced by less invasive options such as sirolimus with or without adjuvant sclerotherapy. In conclusion, each treatment option seems to have its own indications and characteristics, which must be considered in therapeutic decision and individualized for each patient.",

They deform local anatomy and can be life-threatening if they compress the aerodigestive tract or other vital structures. Significant progress has been made in the treatment of LMs in the past 20 years. We conducted a systematic review of the literature on the management of LMs. METHODS: On September 21, 2020, we searched PubMed/MEDLINE for studies published from 2000 to 2020 reporting outcomes of invasive and pharmacologic treatment of LMs. RESULTS: A total of 251 studies met the eligibility criteria. Surgery has continued to be a mainstay in the management of LMs, especially in the treatment of microcystic and mixed lesions. Sclerotherapy has emerged as a first-line treatment of macrocystic LMs and as an adjunctive therapy used in combination with surgery for other lesions. Sirolimus, a strong inhibitor of mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin), has shown tremendous promise in the treatment of LMs, as both an oral and a topical agent. Recent investigations have shown the potential of targeted small molecule modulators of cellular pathways in the treatment of LMs. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple invasive and pharmacologic therapies have been shown to be effective in the treatment of LMs. Future research should focus on rigorous, prospective comparisons of these treatment modalities.",

The clinical characteristics of patients and the concentration and application mode of the drug were recorded. The changes in the signs and symptoms observed and associated adverse effects were noted and analyzed. RESULTS: The study population consisted of 11 patients of an average age of 10.5 years. All were treated with topical rapamycin: 6 patients with a 1% concentration, 1 with a 0.8% concentration, and 4 with a 0.4% concentration. Changes in the clinical appearance of the lesions were observed in all patients. The associated symptoms, present in 9 of 11 patients, improved in every case. The mean follow-up time was 16.1 months. LIMITATIONS: This study is retrospective, with a small sample size and considerable heterogeneity of lesions and treatment approaches.

It is responsible for the majority of symptoms presented, and to date, there is no consensus regarding treatment. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of topical rapamycin in treating superficial lymphatic malformations (LM). METHODS: A case series study was performed of patients with superficial LM, treated with topical rapamycin. The clinical characteristics of patients and the concentration and application mode of the drug were recorded. The changes in the signs and symptoms observed and associated adverse effects were noted and analyzed. RESULTS: The study population consisted of 11 patients of an average age of 10.5 years. All were treated with topical rapamycin: 6 patients with a 1% concentration, 1 with a 0.8% concentration, and 4 with a 0.4% concentration. Changes in the clinical appearance of the lesions were observed in all patients. The associated symptoms, present in 9 of 11 patients, improved in every case. The mean follow-up time was 16.1 months. LIMITATIONS: This study is retrospective, with a small sample size and considerable heterogeneity of lesions and treatment approaches. CONCLUSION: Treatment with topical rapamycin modifies the clinical appearance and alleviates symptoms of superficial LM.",

In this study, we present 8 children with LM who were treated with the Kampo medicine eppikajutsuto (EKJT).Between 2001 and 2020, 8 children (male: 4, female: 4) with LMs who underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation both before and after treatment or observation were selected for investigating the effect of EKJT. Two patients were observed without any treatment for 24 and 60 months. EKJT was evaluated based on percentage reduction, defined as the percentage of total lesions that decreased in size, confirmed by radiological examination after initiating treatment with EKJT or determined by observation alone. Volumetric analysis of LMs on MRI was performed using the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine viewer.Six patients were treated with EKJT. The mean observational period was 13.2 months (range: 6-24 months). The mean reduction in LM volume on MRI was 73.0% in treated patients and -66.3% in observed patients. Two of the 6 lesions exhibited complete reduction, 2 exhibited marked (>90%) reduction, 1 exhibited moderate reduction, and 1 exhibited a small response. The treatment was well-tolerated, with no severe adverse events.This preliminary study demonstrated the beneficial effects of EKJT. Prospective evaluations of this promising therapeutic modality are warranted based on the results of this study.",

These entities have overlapping features but differing responses to treatment. Surgery has been the mainstream treatment in intra-abdominal lymphatic malformation, with variable reported success in the literature. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to review the outcome of different treatments for intra-abdominal lymphatic malformations in children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all intra-abdominal lymphatic malformations from 1999 to 2019 in children treated by the surgical team or followed in the vascular anomalies clinic of our institution. Children were classified into one of three groups: group A, isolated intra-abdominal lymphatic malformation; group B, common lymphatic malformation in continuity with other regions; or group C, intra-abdominal involvement as part of a complex lymphatic anomaly or associated syndrome. RESULTS: Fifty intra-abdominal lymphatic malformations were diagnosed; five of these were excluded. In group A (n=28), the treatment was surgical resection (n=26) or sclerosing treatment (n=1), with one case of spontaneous regression; no recurrence was observed in 25 patients. In group B (n=7), three patients had partial resection and all had recurrence; four had sclerotherapy alone with good response. In group C (n=10), therapeutic options included surgery, sclerosing treatment and pharmacotherapy, with variable outcomes. CONCLUSION: The management of intra-abdominal malformations requires a team approach. Sclerotherapy is successful in treating macrocystic lymphatic malformation. Surgery is successful in treating isolated intra-abdominal common lymphatic malformation, albeit at times at the cost of intestinal resection, which could be avoided by combining surgery with preoperative sclerotherapy. With surgery there is often limited resectability, and therefore recurrence in intra-abdominal lymphatic malformations that are part of complex lymphatic anomalies associated with syndromes, or in common lymphatic malformations in continuity with other regions. Sclerotherapy is an effective modality in these instances along with pharmacotherapy.",

We present a case report of a 32-week pre-term male infant with a massive cervicofacial LM necessitating delivery via ex-utero intrapartum treatment (EXIT). The patient was treated with numerous rounds of sclerotherapy, systemic sirolimus, and surgical debulking, but ultimately died at 4 months of age due to acute pulmonary hemorrhage, which may have been related to sirolimus due to the absence of any other associable organ involvement or derangement. We document the patient's clinical course and treatment regimen, highlighting the myriad modalities employed to treat these challenging lesions, and describe a potentially lethal complication of sirolimus therapy not previously described in the treatment of pediatric LM.",

METHODS: Overall, 320 patients diagnosed with cervical lymphatic malformation were retrospectively analysed in our hospital between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2017. Imaging modalities included colour Doppler ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, and contrast-enhanced computed tomography. Cervical lymphatic malformations were classified by cyst diameter. Treatments included interventional therapy, surgery, and expectant treatment. RESULTS: Cervical lymphatic malformation was identified in 320 of 1192 patients with lymphatic malformation. Four were excluded due to misdiagnosis by ultrasonography. Cervical lymphatic malformation was classified as mixed, macrocystic, and microcystic in 184 (57.5%), 117 (36.56%), and 19 (5.94%) patients, respectively. Sixty-four (20%), ten (3.12%), seven (2.19%), and three (0.94%) patients experienced intracystic haemorrhage, infection, concurrent intracystic haemorrhage and infection, and calcification, respectively. Among 260 (81.25%) patients who underwent interventional sclerotherapy, 163 (50.94%) received it once and 96 (30%) received it two or more times. Twenty-eight (8.75%), five (1.56%), and 27 (8.44%) patients underwent surgical resection, interventional sclerotherapy plus surgery, and expectant management, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasonography is useful for diagnosing definite cervical lymphatic malformation. Interventional therapy is the first choice for children with confirmed cervical lymphatic malformation.",

METHODS: Medical records of patients who were treated for LM in the Paediatric Surgical Centre Universitas Gadjah Mada from January 2015 to January 2019 were reviewed. Scoring systems were used to assess the outcomes, including reduction of size, problems of aesthetics, functional problems, complications, necessity of further interventions, and interventions' frequencies. RESULTS: During the four-year study, we included 31 children, consisting of 6, 5, and 20 patients in Groups I, II, and III, respectively. The total score did not significantly differ between Groups I, II, and III (14.67+-2.80 vs. 13.40+-2.07 vs. 12.50+-1.47, respectively; p=0.056). Group II scored better in aesthetic problems than other groups (p=0.001), Group III scored higher in necessity of further interventions compared to the other groups (p=0.026), and Group I was higher in interventions' frequencies than the other groups (p<0.001). However, there were no significant differences in reduction of size, functional problems, and complications among groups (p=0.554, 0.151, and 0.076, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: There is no significant different effect of the three modalities treatment for LM, although one group might have more beneficial effects compared with the other groups due to different scoring system parameters. Further multicentre and prospective cohort studies with a larger number of patients are necessary to establish the existence and extent of our findings.",

They deform local anatomy and can be life-threatening if they compress the aerodigestive tract or other vital structures. Significant progress has been made in the treatment of LMs in the past 20 years. We conducted a systematic review of the literature on the management of LMs. METHODS: On September 21, 2020, we searched PubMed/MEDLINE for studies published from 2000 to 2020 reporting outcomes of invasive and pharmacologic treatment of LMs. RESULTS: A total of 251 studies met the eligibility criteria. Surgery has continued to be a mainstay in the management of LMs, especially in the treatment of microcystic and mixed lesions. Sclerotherapy has emerged as a first-line treatment of macrocystic LMs and as an adjunctive therapy used in combination with surgery for other lesions. Sirolimus, a strong inhibitor of mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin), has shown tremendous promise in the treatment of LMs, as both an oral and a topical agent. Recent investigations have shown the potential of targeted small molecule modulators of cellular pathways in the treatment of LMs. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple invasive and pharmacologic therapies have been shown to be effective in the treatment of LMs. Future research should focus on rigorous, prospective comparisons of these treatment modalities.",

They arise due to errors in vascular and lymphatic formation during early embryonic development. This leads to persistent infiltration of lymph fluid into soft tissues and causes a locally invasive mass with pathologic sequelae. Departing from historically descriptive terminology, such as \"cystic hygroma,\" lymphatic malformations are now categorized as macrocystic, microcystic, or mixed lesions, based on size. Advances in imaging modalities, such as ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging, have made accurate characterization of these lesions possible and ultimately allow for early diagnosis and implementation of appropriate treatment based on the morphology of the lymphatic malformation. Management of lymphatic malformations can be quite challenging, and a multidisciplinary approach is most effective for optimum aesthetic and functional outcomes. New discoveries in the molecular biology of lymphatic malformations have provided treatment targets and established a role for pharmacotherapy. Sclerotherapy, laser, and radiofrequency ablation have all proven to be effective as minimally invasive treatment options for lymphatic malformations. Surgical intervention has a role in the treatment of focal lesions recalcitrant to these less invasive techniques. Operative planning is dictated by clinical goals, size, anatomic location, characteristics, and extent of infiltration.",

Logically reducing HNLM ITs should reduce treatment risk. We tested whether delaying HNLM ITs reduces total IT number. MATERIALS: Consecutive HNLM patients (n = 199) between 2010 and 2017, aged 0-18 years. METHODS: ITs (surgery or sclerotherapy) were offered for persistent or dysfunction causing HNLMs. Treatment effectiveness categorized by IT number: optimal (0-1), acceptable (2-5), or suboptimal (>5). Clinical data were summarized, and outcome associations tested (chi2 ). Relative risk (RR) with a Poisson working model tested whether HNLM observation or IT delay (>6 months post-diagnosis) predicts treatment success (i.e., <=1 IT). RESULTS: Median age at HNLM diagnosis was 1.3 months (interquartile range [IQR] 0-45 m) with 107/199(54%) male. HNLM were stage I-III (174 [88%]), IV-V (25 [13%]). Initial treatment was observation (70 [35%]), invasive (129 [65%]). Treatment outcomes were optimal (137 [69%]), acceptable (36 [18%]), and suboptimal (26 [13%]). Suboptimal outcome associations: EXIT procedure, stage IV-V, oral location, and tracheotomy (p < 0.001). Stage I-III HNLMs were initially observed compared with stage I-III having ITs within 6 months of HNLM diagnosis, had a 82% lower relative treatment failure risk ([i.e., >1 IT], RR = 0.09, 95% CI 0.02-0.36, p < 0.001). Stage I-III HNLMs with non-delayed ITs had reduced treatment failure risk compared with IV-V (RR = 0.47, 95% CI 0.33-0.66, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Observation and delayed IT in stage I-III HNLM (\"Grade 1\") is safe and reduces IT (i.e., <=1 IT). Stage IV-V HNLMs (\"Grade 2\") with early IT have a greater risk of multiple ITs.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of literature until 16 November 2021 was performed on treatments of LMs in the head and neck. RESULTS: Out of 9044 articles, 54 studies were eligible for inclusion with 26 studies providing detailed participant data. A total number of 1573 patients with a mean age of 21.22 months were analysed. Comparative meta-analysis did not reveal significant differences two proportions of volume reduction (>= 50% and 100%) between sclerotherapy and surgical treatment. Regression demonstrated that positive predictors for volume reduction were surgery 17 (95% CI 0.26-34; p = 0.047) and treatment of macrocystic lesions 19 (95% CI 5.5-32; p = 0.006). Treatment of mixed lesions also demonstrated a trend towards achieving a greater volume reduction (p = 0.052). A higher de Serres stage of the lesion had a negative effect on the amount of volume reduction - 3.7 (95% CI - 7.0 to - 0.35; p = 0.030). CONCLUSION: This comprehensive meta-analysis demonstrated no significant difference in volume reduction between various treatment modalities at study level. However, individual patient data indicated that surgery and larger cyst types are associated with a significant higher percentage of volume reduction, whereas a higher de Serres stage negatively impacted the amount of volume reduction. These findings can be used for patient counseling and treatment planning based on cyst type and de Serres stage. However volume reduction constitutes just one objective within a more complex treatment spectrum.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies (ISSVA) classification distinguishes between common lymphatic malformations and complex lymphatic anomalies. These entities have overlapping features but differing responses to treatment. Surgery has been the mainstream treatment in intra-abdominal lymphatic malformation, with variable reported success in the literature. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to review the outcome of different treatments for intra-abdominal lymphatic malformations in children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all intra-abdominal lymphatic malformations from 1999 to 2019 in children treated by the surgical team or followed in the vascular anomalies clinic of our institution. Children were classified into one of three groups: group A, isolated intra-abdominal lymphatic malformation; group B, common lymphatic malformation in continuity with other regions; or group C, intra-abdominal involvement as part of a complex lymphatic anomaly or associated syndrome. RESULTS: Fifty intra-abdominal lymphatic malformations were diagnosed; five of these were excluded. In group A (n=28), the treatment was surgical resection (n=26) or sclerosing treatment (n=1), with one case of spontaneous regression; no recurrence was observed in 25 patients. In group B (n=7), three patients had partial resection and all had recurrence; four had sclerotherapy alone with good response. In group C (n=10), therapeutic options included surgery, sclerosing treatment and pharmacotherapy, with variable outcomes. CONCLUSION: The management of intra-abdominal malformations requires a team approach. Sclerotherapy is successful in treating macrocystic lymphatic malformation. Surgery is successful in treating isolated intra-abdominal common lymphatic malformation, albeit at times at the cost of intestinal resection, which could be avoided by combining surgery with preoperative sclerotherapy. With surgery there is often limited resectability, and therefore recurrence in intra-abdominal lymphatic malformations that are part of complex lymphatic anomalies associated with syndromes, or in common lymphatic malformations in continuity with other regions. Sclerotherapy is an effective modality in these instances along with pharmacotherapy.",

Progressive growth of lesions may cause pressure to the surrounding organs. Lesions frequently reoccur after treatment with surgery, sclerotherapy, radiotherapy, and laser therapy. In the last decades, oral sirolimus has been successfully used in lymphatic malformations. Since systemic treatment with sirolimus is associated with various side effects, topical form of the drug has been used with satisfying results, especially for the angiofibromas. Promisingly, few case studies indicate topical sirolimus as a potential treatment for the lymphatic malformations. Here, we report an 8-year-old girl with MLM on left trunk whose lesions recurred after the surgery that has been performed at 1 year of age. We administered twice daily topical sirolimus at 0.75 mg/ml concentration. After 2 weeks, a local irritation occurred and the dose was decreased to once daily. The treatment was stopped at the end of 3 months as the lesions were almost cleared and the patient did not want to continue to therapy. There were no new lesions after 8 months of follow up.",

They deform local anatomy and can be life-threatening if they compress the aerodigestive tract or other vital structures. Significant progress has been made in the treatment of LMs in the past 20 years. We conducted a systematic review of the literature on the management of LMs. METHODS: On September 21, 2020, we searched PubMed/MEDLINE for studies published from 2000 to 2020 reporting outcomes of invasive and pharmacologic treatment of LMs. RESULTS: A total of 251 studies met the eligibility criteria. Surgery has continued to be a mainstay in the management of LMs, especially in the treatment of microcystic and mixed lesions. Sclerotherapy has emerged as a first-line treatment of macrocystic LMs and as an adjunctive therapy used in combination with surgery for other lesions. Sirolimus, a strong inhibitor of mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin), has shown tremendous promise in the treatment of LMs, as both an oral and a topical agent. Recent investigations have shown the potential of targeted small molecule modulators of cellular pathways in the treatment of LMs. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple invasive and pharmacologic therapies have been shown to be effective in the treatment of LMs. Future research should focus on rigorous, prospective comparisons of these treatment modalities.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lymphatic malformations (LM) are rare congenital lesions with varied clinical presentations, from asymptomatic to life-threatening. Regardless of initial presentation, many are treated aggressively either surgically or medically. There is a scarcity of literature regarding expectant management, this study compares current literature surrounding the outcomes of LMs managed conservatively to a provincial database in which conservative management was the primary treatment. METHODS: Retrospective chart review of all pediatric patients diagnosed with a lymphatic malformation in Newfoundland and Labrador between 1989-2019. In total, 43 patients were reviewed, 2 were excluded due to inadequate follow up, 1 was excluded due to initial life-threatening presentation requiring intervention. Of these patients, 32 were managed conservatively without any intervention, 7 surgically, and 1 aspirated. Data extracted included age at referral, management, complications, clinical regression and patient satisfaction, years of follow up, and recurrence rate. RESULTS: Patients managed expectantly had partial or complete clinical regression in 81%. Anecdotal regression as reported by patients and family was 84%. This is compared to a 45% clinical regression with expectant management in the literature and a recent systematic review with a 48% overall regression rate with sclerotherapy [10,12]. Average follow up was 6 years and average time to regression was 6.6 years. No major complications were reported. Recurrence rate in expectant management was 0% versus 21% in surgical group. CONCLUSIONS: Expectant management is a safe and viable alternative to more aggressive treatments and ultimately leads to regression in the majority of cases. It should be considered as first line for non-life-threatening lymphatic malformations.",

Our aim was to identify factors associated with the occurrence of permanent postoperative complications. METHODS: This was a case series study of children operated on for LMs between 2001 and 2021 and followed-up in our institution. Patients who presented sequelae derived from surgical treatment (cases) and those who did not (controls) were compared. RESULTS: We included 112 children who underwent surgery for LMs in different centers. Forty-nine cases and 63 controls were included (58% male), with a mean age of 34 months. Patients younger than 1 year presented more complications than older children, 59% (n = 29/49) vs 41% (n = 24/49), respectively (P = .02). LMs were in the cervicofacial region in seven patients in the control group compared with 30 of the cases (P <= .001), with microcystic malformations the most associated with sequelae (n = 11/15; P = .019). Concerning permanent complications, 88% were neurological (n = 43/49), mainly peripheral facial palsy (n = 17). There was greater postoperative residual disease in controls compared with cases (65% vs 14%, respectively; P <= .0001). However, following a second procedure in the control group, there was no significant difference in long-term cure rates (P = .38). CONCLUSIONS: The risk of sequelae following surgery for LM increases significantly in patients younger than 12 months in cervicofacial and microcystic malformations. Because non-radical resections are associated with fewer complications and an optimal long-term cure rate, we consider that aggressive surgical approaches should be avoided if the absence of sequelae is not guaranteed.",

                    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Lymphatic malformations (LMs) are low-flow lesions resulting from abnormalities in the development of lymphatics. The management of these lesions is complex and involve the collaboration of many specialties. The purpose of this review is to summarize current knowledge regarding the different therapeutic options used in complex lymphatic malformations, analyzing their indications, efficacy and complications. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A search was made using the algorithm: \"(lymphatic abnormality OR lymphatic malformation OR lymphangioma OR cystic hygroma) AND (extensive OR giant OR complex) AND (therapeutics OR treatment) AND (child OR children)\". Of the 120 articles found, 53 were included. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Historically, surgery was the treatment of choice for this type of lesions. However, excision was often incomplete, associated with high rates of recurrence and severe complications. The use of sclerotherapy emerged as a minimal invasive option appropriate in selected cases as a single or adjuvant therapy. Inhibitors of the mammalian target of rapamycin, such as sirolimus, now play a central role in the treatment of complex malformations resistant to sclerotherapy, recurrent after surgery or more extensive malformations that affect vital structures. Other therapeutic options as sildenafil and laser ablation are also recognized as effective in selected cases. CONCLUSIONS: Looking through the literature over the last decade authors realize that surgery had gradually been replaced by less invasive options such as sirolimus with or without adjuvant sclerotherapy. In conclusion, each treatment option seems to have its own indications and characteristics, which must be considered in therapeutic decision and individualized for each patient.",

Treatment depends on their characteristics: surgery, sclerotherapy, both combined, systemic treatment or observation. This study aims to analyze the surgical and interventional management of LMs in children over the last two decades in our university hospital. METHODS: Management of children born with LMs between 2000 and 2019 was reviewed. Parameters collected were: malformation characteristics, type of treatment, symptoms, imaging, timing of diagnosis and first treatment, number of interventions, recovery rate, complications and length of stay. RESULTS: Files of 48 children were reviewed: 27 with macrocystic and 21 with microcystic LMs. There was no statistically significant difference in type of treatment except for combined treatment, more performed in microcystic LMs (p = 0.04). Symptoms, imaging, timing of diagnosis and first treatment, number of interventions and complications were not statistically significant. Overall, the number of surgeries was lower than sclerotherapies (p = 0.04). Recovery rate after surgery was higher in macrocystic LMs (p = 0.01). Complications and length of stay were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: A good rate of recovery was observed when surgery was performed, with no significant increase in complications and length of stay. A prospective study will be determinant to create a decisional algorithm for children with LMs.",

METHODS: Medical records of patients who were treated for LM in the Paediatric Surgical Centre Universitas Gadjah Mada from January 2015 to January 2019 were reviewed. Scoring systems were used to assess the outcomes, including reduction of size, problems of aesthetics, functional problems, complications, necessity of further interventions, and interventions' frequencies. RESULTS: During the four-year study, we included 31 children, consisting of 6, 5, and 20 patients in Groups I, II, and III, respectively. The total score did not significantly differ between Groups I, II, and III (14.67+-2.80 vs. 13.40+-2.07 vs. 12.50+-1.47, respectively; p=0.056). Group II scored better in aesthetic problems than other groups (p=0.001), Group III scored higher in necessity of further interventions compared to the other groups (p=0.026), and Group I was higher in interventions' frequencies than the other groups (p<0.001). However, there were no significant differences in reduction of size, functional problems, and complications among groups (p=0.554, 0.151, and 0.076, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: There is no significant different effect of the three modalities treatment for LM, although one group might have more beneficial effects compared with the other groups due to different scoring system parameters. Further multicentre and prospective cohort studies with a larger number of patients are necessary to establish the existence and extent of our findings.",

                    "title": "Sirolimus is efficacious in treatment for extensive and/or complex slow-flow vascular malformations: a monocentric prospective phase II study.",
                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Extensive and complex vascular malformations often cause chronic pain and severe functional restraint. Conventional treatments, such as surgery and/or sclerotherapy, are rarely curative, underscoring the great need for new therapeutic modalities. Recent preclinical and clinical data demonstrated that sirolimus could offset the progression of vascular malformations and significantly improve quality of life of patients through inhibition of the Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. The purpose of this prospective study was to assess the efficacy and safety of this treatment in patients with extensive or complex slow-flow vascular malformations. METHODS: Sirolimus was administered orally on a continuous dosing schedule with pharmacokinetic-guided target serum concentration level of 10 to 15 ng/ml. Patients were seen every month for the first three months and subsequently every three months. The primary endpoints were safety and efficacy, based on clinical, biological and radiological evaluations, as well as a quality of life questionnaire. RESULTS: Nineteen patients, from 3 to 64 years old, with lymphatic (LM), venous (VM) or complex slow-flow malformations, refractory to standard care, were enrolled and received sirolimus continuously. After 12 months of follow-up, 16 patients were available for assessment of efficacy and safety: all had a significant and rapid improvement of their symptoms and quality of life. In two patients, sirolimus treatment permitted sclerotherapy and surgery, initially evaluated unfeasible. Sirolimus was well tolerated, with mucositis as the most common (10% of patients) grade 3 adverse event. CONCLUSIONS: Sirolimus was efficient in extensive LM, VM and/or complex malformations that were refractory to conventional treatments and was well tolerated.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Large fetal head and neck (HN) masses can be life-threatening at birth and postnatally owing to airway obstruction. The two most frequent congenital masses that may obstruct the airway are lymphatic malformation (LM) and teratoma. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the results of our experience in the management of giant congenital HN masses and to conduct a literature review. METHODS: The study involved a consecutive series of 13 newborns (7 females) affected by giant HN masses. Prenatal diagnosis was achieved by means of ultrasound (US) and fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Delivery was performed by means of EXIT procedure in case of radiological evidence of airway obstruction. In the postnatal period all feasible therapeutic options (surgery, sclerotherapy, medical therapy) were discussed and adopted by a multidisciplinary team. Twelve patients underwent surgery and one received Rapamycin for one month, with consequent surgical resection owing to increasing size of the mass. RESULTS: The histopathological diagnosis was LM in 11 cases and teratoma in 2 cases. Airway obstruction was solved in 11 cases; 2 LM patients required a tracheotomy because of persistent airway obstruction. Major complications were flap necrosis (one patient) and facial nerve palsy (2 cases). Recurrence occurred in 5 patients. CONCLUSIONS: The management of congenital HN masses is always challenging and necessarily requires an interdisciplinary approach. Current therapeutic options include surgery, sclerotherapy, medical therapy or a combination of them. When they are large enough to obstruct the airway, a patient-centered approach should guide timing and modality of treatment. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Acquired lymphangioma circumscriptum of the vulva is rare and can occur subsequent to malignancies of the anogenital and pelvic region. We sought to investigate the clinicopathologic characteristics of malignancy-associated acquired vulvar lymphangioma circumscriptum (AVLC). METHODS: We identified all cases of AVLC within our institution with history of prior malignancy between 2005 and 2021. A similar search was performed in the PubMed database to identify published cases to date. The clinical and histopathologic information was recorded. RESULTS: A total of 71 cases were identified. The most common preceding malignancy was cervical carcinoma (71.8%, 51/71). Radiation therapy was given to 91.4% (64/70) of the patients and lymph node dissection was made on 70.2% (40/57). Median interval between the diagnosis of malignancy and the AVLC was 10 years (range 0-32 years). AVLC frequently presented as vesicular (31.6%, 18/57) or verrucous (28.1%, 16/57) lesions clinically. Common treatments for AVLC included excision (53.1%, 26/49) and laser therapy (16.3%, 8/49), with an overall recurrence rate of 42.9% (24/56) at a median follow-up interval of 1.8 years (range 0.04-32.3 years). CONCLUSION: AVLC is a rare, late complication of anogenital and pelvic malignancies causing debilitating physical symptoms and psychological stress. Further studies are warranted to determine the most effective treatment modalities to mitigate recurrence.",

Progressive growth of lesions may cause pressure to the surrounding organs. Lesions frequently reoccur after treatment with surgery, sclerotherapy, radiotherapy, and laser therapy. In the last decades, oral sirolimus has been successfully used in lymphatic malformations. Since systemic treatment with sirolimus is associated with various side effects, topical form of the drug has been used with satisfying results, especially for the angiofibromas. Promisingly, few case studies indicate topical sirolimus as a potential treatment for the lymphatic malformations. Here, we report an 8-year-old girl with MLM on left trunk whose lesions recurred after the surgery that has been performed at 1 year of age. We administered twice daily topical sirolimus at 0.75 mg/ml concentration. After 2 weeks, a local irritation occurred and the dose was decreased to once daily. The treatment was stopped at the end of 3 months as the lesions were almost cleared and the patient did not want to continue to therapy. There were no new lesions after 8 months of follow up.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The first-line treatment of lymphatic malformations (LMs) is pharmacological or interventional; however, surgery is still necessary in selected cases. Our aim was to identify factors associated with the occurrence of permanent postoperative complications. METHODS: This was a case series study of children operated on for LMs between 2001 and 2021 and followed-up in our institution. Patients who presented sequelae derived from surgical treatment (cases) and those who did not (controls) were compared. RESULTS: We included 112 children who underwent surgery for LMs in different centers. Forty-nine cases and 63 controls were included (58% male), with a mean age of 34 months. Patients younger than 1 year presented more complications than older children, 59% (n = 29/49) vs 41% (n = 24/49), respectively (P = .02). LMs were in the cervicofacial region in seven patients in the control group compared with 30 of the cases (P <= .001), with microcystic malformations the most associated with sequelae (n = 11/15; P = .019). Concerning permanent complications, 88% were neurological (n = 43/49), mainly peripheral facial palsy (n = 17). There was greater postoperative residual disease in controls compared with cases (65% vs 14%, respectively; P <= .0001). However, following a second procedure in the control group, there was no significant difference in long-term cure rates (P = .38). CONCLUSIONS: The risk of sequelae following surgery for LM increases significantly in patients younger than 12 months in cervicofacial and microcystic malformations. Because non-radical resections are associated with fewer complications and an optimal long-term cure rate, we consider that aggressive surgical approaches should be avoided if the absence of sequelae is not guaranteed.",

They arise due to errors in vascular and lymphatic formation during early embryonic development. This leads to persistent infiltration of lymph fluid into soft tissues and causes a locally invasive mass with pathologic sequelae. Departing from historically descriptive terminology, such as \"cystic hygroma,\" lymphatic malformations are now categorized as macrocystic, microcystic, or mixed lesions, based on size. Advances in imaging modalities, such as ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging, have made accurate characterization of these lesions possible and ultimately allow for early diagnosis and implementation of appropriate treatment based on the morphology of the lymphatic malformation. Management of lymphatic malformations can be quite challenging, and a multidisciplinary approach is most effective for optimum aesthetic and functional outcomes. New discoveries in the molecular biology of lymphatic malformations have provided treatment targets and established a role for pharmacotherapy. Sclerotherapy, laser, and radiofrequency ablation have all proven to be effective as minimally invasive treatment options for lymphatic malformations. Surgical intervention has a role in the treatment of focal lesions recalcitrant to these less invasive techniques. Operative planning is dictated by clinical goals, size, anatomic location, characteristics, and extent of infiltration.",

According to the classification of the International Society for the Study of the Vascular Anomalies, there are macrocystic, microcystic and mixed types of lymphatic malformations. The typical location of the lymphangiomas is the area of large lymphatic collectors (head, neck, axillary areas), while the scrotum is not frequently affected. AIM: To present a rare clinical case of lymphatic malformation of the scrotum with successful minimally invasive treatment (sclerotherapy). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A clinical observation of a 12-year-old child with a diagnosis of \"Lymphatic malformation of the scrotum\" is presented. From the age of 4, there was a large lesion in the left half of the scrotum. In other clinic, a surgical removal with a diagnosis of \"left-sided inguinal hernia\", \"spermatic cord hydrocele\", \"isolated left-sided hydrocele\" was performed. However, there was a recurrence after the procedure. When contacting the Clinic of pediatrics and pediatric surgery, scrotal lymphangioma was suspected. The diagnosis was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging. The patient underwent minimally invasive sclerotherapy using the drug \"Haemoblock\". After 6 months of follow-up, no relapse was seen. CONCLUSION: Lymphangioma (lymphatic malformation) of the scrotum is a rare urological pathology that requires specific diagnosis, in-depth differential diagnosis and treatment by a multidisciplinary team of doctors, including a specialist in the treatment of vascular pathology.",

The most common preceding malignancy was cervical carcinoma (71.8%, 51/71). Radiation therapy was given to 91.4% (64/70) of the patients and lymph node dissection was made on 70.2% (40/57). Median interval between the diagnosis of malignancy and the AVLC was 10 years (range 0-32 years). AVLC frequently presented as vesicular (31.6%, 18/57) or verrucous (28.1%, 16/57) lesions clinically. Common treatments for AVLC included excision (53.1%, 26/49) and laser therapy (16.3%, 8/49), with an overall recurrence rate of 42.9% (24/56) at a median follow-up interval of 1.8 years (range 0.04-32.3 years). CONCLUSION: AVLC is a rare, late complication of anogenital and pelvic malignancies causing debilitating physical symptoms and psychological stress. Further studies are warranted to determine the most effective treatment modalities to mitigate recurrence.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Abdominal lymphatic malformations (LM) are a rare subset of vascular anomaly caused by abnormal development of the lymphatic system. They are classified as macrocystic, microcystic or combination macrocystic and microcystic. Surgical resection, percutaneous sclerotherapy, and medical therapy are all employed to treat these complex and often symptomatic lesions. No standardized treatment algorithm exists currently. The purpose of this study was to establish a multidisciplinary treatment approach to abdominal LMs. METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted from 2013 to 2019 on patients with abdominal LMs at a single tertiary children's hospital vascular anomalies center. Demographics, imaging, and treatment modality were recorded. Clinical and/or radiographic response to the primary treatment modality as well as complications was the outcomes measured. RESULTS: Nineteen patients (12 macrocystic, 5 microcystic and 2 combined) were identified, with a median age at diagnosis of 2.2 years (range 0.1-20.8 years). Sclerotherapy was the most common primary treatment, followed by surgical resection and sirolimus. No difference in clinical response (p = 0.58) or complications (p = 0.31) was observed based on primary treatment or subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our institutional experience, we propose an LM subtype-based treatment algorithm for abdominal LMs. It employs a multidisciplinary approach, and results in satisfactory patient outcomes with minimal complications.

Unlike previous studies, this series includes pediatric and adult patients, highlights a single stage partial excision of a complex venous malformation, and describes the first description of using glue prior to resection of a macrocystic lymphatic malformation. STUDY DESIGN: Case series with chart review. SETTING: Tertiary-care adult and pediatric hospital. SUBJECTS AND RESULTS: Four patients (3 males - 9, 13, 25 years, 1 female - 61 years) underwent same day excision of head and neck vascular malformations utilizing immediate preoperative n-BCA glue embolization performed by interventional radiology and otolaryngology, as described by Tieu et al. The indications for resection included bleeding (1/4), pain (3/4), cosmetic deformity (3/4), and discomfort with denture wear (1/4). Prior interventions included none (1/4), cautery and primary closure to control acute hemorrhage (1/4), and sclerotherapy (2/4). Treatments included complete embolization and resection of simple venous malformation (VM)s of the oral cavity/lip (2/4), partial embolization and resection of a complex hemifacial venous malformation (VM) (1/4), and complete embolization and resection of a lymphatic malformation (LM) (1/4). On average, 97 min of anesthesia time was added for the preoperative embolization procedure (range, 94-104 min). All patients had a successful embolization without need for coils. Operative time ranged from 28 to 44 min for the simple cases and was 6 h and 30 min for the complex case. There was minimal blood loss in all cases. There were no associated complications, lesion recurrences, or long-term deficits at an average follow-up of 5 months. The patient with the complex hemifacial VM demonstrated subtle lower facial weakness post-operatively, which completely resolved within two months. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of head and neck vascular malformations with preoperative n-BCA glue and subsequent surgical excision is a viable method for both simple and complex lesions. The safety and efficacy of this technique has been demonstrated in the past in a limited number of studies. This study further supports the use of this technique to address patient concerns such as pain or discomfort and cosmetic deformity, even if the lesion is only partially resectable. In our series a lymphatic malformation refractory to sclerotherapy was treated with a similar technique of glue and resection, following aspiration of the mucoid LM fluid. Our series emphasizes that pediatric vascular malformations carry functional and cosmetic deficits into adulthood that can and should be addressed in this patient population. Therefore, same-day embolization and resection should be coordinated when possible, in order to optimize patient safety and convenience.",

                    "title": "A Radiologic Grading System for Assessing the Radiographic Outcome of Treatment in Lymphatic and Lymphatic-Venous Malformations of the Head and Neck.",
                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Two-thirds of lymphatic malformations in children are found in the head and neck. Although conventionally managed through surgical resection, percutaneous sclerotherapy has gained popularity. No reproducible grading system has been designed to compare sclerotherapy outcomes on the basis of radiologic findings. We propose an MR imaging-based grading scale to assess the response to sclerotherapy and present an evaluation of its interrater reliability. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A grading system was developed to stratify treatment outcomes on the basis of interval changes observed on MR imaging. By means of this system, 56 consecutive cases from our institution with formally diagnosed head and neck lymphatic malformations treated by sclerotherapy were retrospectively graded. Each patient underwent pre- and posttreatment MR imaging. Each study was evaluated by 3 experienced neuroradiologists. Interrater reliability was assessed using the Krippendorff alpha statistic, intraclass coefficient, and 2-way Spearman rho correlation. RESULTS: The overall Krippendorff alpha statistic was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.89-0.95), denoting excellent agreement among raters. Intraclass coefficients with respect to consistency and absolute agreements were both 0.97 (95% CI, 0.96-0.98), illustrating low variability. Every combination of individual rater pairs demonstrated statistically significant (P < .01) linear Spearman rho correlations, with values ranging from 0.90 to 0.95. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed radiographic grading scale demonstrates excellent interrater reliability. Adoption of this new scale can standardize reported outcomes following sclerotherapy for head and neck lymphatic malformation and may aid in the investigation of future questions regarding optimal management of these lesions.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Cervicofacial lymphatic malformations (CFLM) are rare, potentially life-threatening vascular anomalies, yet reports on multidisciplinary treatment strategies are lacking. We evaluated outcomes for CFLMs following sclerotherapy, surgical resection, and/or medical management. METHODS: We identified children with a CFLM at a vascular anomalies center from 2004 to 2019. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: retro-orbital malformations, untreated malformations, patients without follow-up. Primary clinical outcome was contour improvement, with significance defined as LM volume reduction of >50% by cross-sectional imaging. RESULTS: Sixty-three children met inclusion criteria: 35 with macrocystic CFLMs, six with microcystic CFLMs, and 22 with mixed-type malformations. Mean post-intervention follow-up was 27.5 months. Fifty-eight patients underwent sclerotherapy (median: two treatments). Doxycycline and/or bleomycin were used in 95% of patients. After sclerotherapy, 97% of macrocystic CFLMs improved significantly compared to 82% of mixed and 67% of microcystic lesions. Sixteen children underwent surgical resection with 75% significantly improving; two additional patients were successfully treated with sclerotherapy after debulking surgery. Six children received sirolimus for microcystic disease, of which 33% significantly improved. CONCLUSION: Sclerotherapy is very effective for macrocystic components of CFLMs, albeit less so for microcystic disease. Microcystic CFLMs frequently require surgical resection. Sirolimus is a helpful therapeutic adjunct, particularly for microcystic lesions, but more study is needed. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, prognosis study.",

Their clinical diagnosis is difficult, and imaging studies are essential to determine the type and extent of vessels involved. Treatment can be challenging and must be managed by a multidisciplinary team. METHODS: A descriptive, observational, retrospective, longitudinal study of clinical records of patients diagnosed with IVMs who were evaluated at the vascular anomalies clinic from January 2011 to December 2021 was performed. Demographic, clinical, imaging, diagnosis, treatment, and response data were collected. RESULTS: Seven patients (five females and two males) with a mean age of 13.66 years (standard deviation 5.82 years) were included in the study. In all cases, the clinical diagnosis was venous and lymphatic malformation. The radiological findings were dilated and tortuous vascular structures or multilobulated lesions with septa inside, with or without vascular flow; these findings allowed diagnosis in all cases. Treatment modalities included sclerotherapy in five patients, surgical resection in two, medical treatment with sirolimus in three, and surveillance in one. Subsequent clinical evolution was favorable in all patients, with decreased pain in six (partial in four and total in two) and size reduction in one patient. CONCLUSION: IVMs in our pediatric population most frequently affect the lower extremities. The main symptoms and signs were pain on exertion and volume increase. Treatment can be challenging given the extension and depth of the malformations, so a combination of therapeutic modalities may be necessary to obtain the best outcome.",

Unlike previous studies, this series includes pediatric and adult patients, highlights a single stage partial excision of a complex venous malformation, and describes the first description of using glue prior to resection of a macrocystic lymphatic malformation. STUDY DESIGN: Case series with chart review. SETTING: Tertiary-care adult and pediatric hospital. SUBJECTS AND RESULTS: Four patients (3 males - 9, 13, 25 years, 1 female - 61 years) underwent same day excision of head and neck vascular malformations utilizing immediate preoperative n-BCA glue embolization performed by interventional radiology and otolaryngology, as described by Tieu et al. The indications for resection included bleeding (1/4), pain (3/4), cosmetic deformity (3/4), and discomfort with denture wear (1/4). Prior interventions included none (1/4), cautery and primary closure to control acute hemorrhage (1/4), and sclerotherapy (2/4). Treatments included complete embolization and resection of simple venous malformation (VM)s of the oral cavity/lip (2/4), partial embolization and resection of a complex hemifacial venous malformation (VM) (1/4), and complete embolization and resection of a lymphatic malformation (LM) (1/4). On average, 97 min of anesthesia time was added for the preoperative embolization procedure (range, 94-104 min). All patients had a successful embolization without need for coils. Operative time ranged from 28 to 44 min for the simple cases and was 6 h and 30 min for the complex case. There was minimal blood loss in all cases. There were no associated complications, lesion recurrences, or long-term deficits at an average follow-up of 5 months. The patient with the complex hemifacial VM demonstrated subtle lower facial weakness post-operatively, which completely resolved within two months. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of head and neck vascular malformations with preoperative n-BCA glue and subsequent surgical excision is a viable method for both simple and complex lesions. The safety and efficacy of this technique has been demonstrated in the past in a limited number of studies. This study further supports the use of this technique to address patient concerns such as pain or discomfort and cosmetic deformity, even if the lesion is only partially resectable. In our series a lymphatic malformation refractory to sclerotherapy was treated with a similar technique of glue and resection, following aspiration of the mucoid LM fluid. Our series emphasizes that pediatric vascular malformations carry functional and cosmetic deficits into adulthood that can and should be addressed in this patient population. Therefore, same-day embolization and resection should be coordinated when possible, in order to optimize patient safety and convenience.",

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all fetuses who underwent EXIT procedures between 2003 and 2018. RESULTS: EXIT procedures were performed in nine cases. The prenatal diagnosis of the neonates was congenital high airway obstruction syndrome in four cases, the neck masse in five cases. Although the airway management under the EXIT procedure was successful in eight cases, the airway management failed in one case. During the EXIT procedures, the airway was managed by endotracheal intubation in two cases, whereas six cases underwent tracheostomy. Six cases with fetal airway obstruction survived to discharge, whereas three cases died due to airway management failure or complications of the underlying disease. A case with a cervical teratoma underwent tumor resection the day after birth due to rapid enlargement of the neck mass. Long-term survival was achieved in five cases. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that the EXIT procedure was effective and could be performed safely in the airway management of fetuses with suspected airway obstruction. The treatment strategy for the neck masses should be planned before birth.",

Logically reducing HNLM ITs should reduce treatment risk. We tested whether delaying HNLM ITs reduces total IT number. MATERIALS: Consecutive HNLM patients (n = 199) between 2010 and 2017, aged 0-18 years. METHODS: ITs (surgery or sclerotherapy) were offered for persistent or dysfunction causing HNLMs. Treatment effectiveness categorized by IT number: optimal (0-1), acceptable (2-5), or suboptimal (>5). Clinical data were summarized, and outcome associations tested (chi2 ). Relative risk (RR) with a Poisson working model tested whether HNLM observation or IT delay (>6 months post-diagnosis) predicts treatment success (i.e., <=1 IT). RESULTS: Median age at HNLM diagnosis was 1.3 months (interquartile range [IQR] 0-45 m) with 107/199(54%) male. HNLM were stage I-III (174 [88%]), IV-V (25 [13%]). Initial treatment was observation (70 [35%]), invasive (129 [65%]). Treatment outcomes were optimal (137 [69%]), acceptable (36 [18%]), and suboptimal (26 [13%]). Suboptimal outcome associations: EXIT procedure, stage IV-V, oral location, and tracheotomy (p < 0.001). Stage I-III HNLMs were initially observed compared with stage I-III having ITs within 6 months of HNLM diagnosis, had a 82% lower relative treatment failure risk ([i.e., >1 IT], RR = 0.09, 95% CI 0.02-0.36, p < 0.001). Stage I-III HNLMs with non-delayed ITs had reduced treatment failure risk compared with IV-V (RR = 0.47, 95% CI 0.33-0.66, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Observation and delayed IT in stage I-III HNLM (\"Grade 1\") is safe and reduces IT (i.e., <=1 IT). Stage IV-V HNLMs (\"Grade 2\") with early IT have a greater risk of multiple ITs.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Large fetal head and neck (HN) masses can be life-threatening at birth and postnatally owing to airway obstruction. The two most frequent congenital masses that may obstruct the airway are lymphatic malformation (LM) and teratoma. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the results of our experience in the management of giant congenital HN masses and to conduct a literature review. METHODS: The study involved a consecutive series of 13 newborns (7 females) affected by giant HN masses. Prenatal diagnosis was achieved by means of ultrasound (US) and fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Delivery was performed by means of EXIT procedure in case of radiological evidence of airway obstruction. In the postnatal period all feasible therapeutic options (surgery, sclerotherapy, medical therapy) were discussed and adopted by a multidisciplinary team. Twelve patients underwent surgery and one received Rapamycin for one month, with consequent surgical resection owing to increasing size of the mass. RESULTS: The histopathological diagnosis was LM in 11 cases and teratoma in 2 cases. Airway obstruction was solved in 11 cases; 2 LM patients required a tracheotomy because of persistent airway obstruction. Major complications were flap necrosis (one patient) and facial nerve palsy (2 cases). Recurrence occurred in 5 patients. CONCLUSIONS: The management of congenital HN masses is always challenging and necessarily requires an interdisciplinary approach. Current therapeutic options include surgery, sclerotherapy, medical therapy or a combination of them. When they are large enough to obstruct the airway, a patient-centered approach should guide timing and modality of treatment. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV.",

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all fetuses who underwent EXIT procedures between 2003 and 2018. RESULTS: EXIT procedures were performed in nine cases. The prenatal diagnosis of the neonates was congenital high airway obstruction syndrome in four cases, the neck masse in five cases. Although the airway management under the EXIT procedure was successful in eight cases, the airway management failed in one case. During the EXIT procedures, the airway was managed by endotracheal intubation in two cases, whereas six cases underwent tracheostomy. Six cases with fetal airway obstruction survived to discharge, whereas three cases died due to airway management failure or complications of the underlying disease. A case with a cervical teratoma underwent tumor resection the day after birth due to rapid enlargement of the neck mass. Long-term survival was achieved in five cases. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that the EXIT procedure was effective and could be performed safely in the airway management of fetuses with suspected airway obstruction. The treatment strategy for the neck masses should be planned before birth.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Acquired lymphangioma circumscriptum of the vulva is rare and can occur subsequent to malignancies of the anogenital and pelvic region. We sought to investigate the clinicopathologic characteristics of malignancy-associated acquired vulvar lymphangioma circumscriptum (AVLC). METHODS: We identified all cases of AVLC within our institution with history of prior malignancy between 2005 and 2021. A similar search was performed in the PubMed database to identify published cases to date. The clinical and histopathologic information was recorded. RESULTS: A total of 71 cases were identified. The most common preceding malignancy was cervical carcinoma (71.8%, 51/71). Radiation therapy was given to 91.4% (64/70) of the patients and lymph node dissection was made on 70.2% (40/57). Median interval between the diagnosis of malignancy and the AVLC was 10 years (range 0-32 years). AVLC frequently presented as vesicular (31.6%, 18/57) or verrucous (28.1%, 16/57) lesions clinically. Common treatments for AVLC included excision (53.1%, 26/49) and laser therapy (16.3%, 8/49), with an overall recurrence rate of 42.9% (24/56) at a median follow-up interval of 1.8 years (range 0.04-32.3 years). CONCLUSION: AVLC is a rare, late complication of anogenital and pelvic malignancies causing debilitating physical symptoms and psychological stress. Further studies are warranted to determine the most effective treatment modalities to mitigate recurrence.",

Progressive cases may result in lethal outcomes and have proven difficult to treat. Sirolimus is showing promising results in the management of vascular anomalies. We examined the efficacy and safety of sirolimus treatment in patients with progressive LAs. METHODS: All patients with LAs treated with sirolimus from May 2015 to September 2018 were included. They received oral sirolimus once a day and the dose was adjusted so that the trough concentration remained within 5-15 ng/mL. We prospectively reviewed the response to drugs (the response rate of radiological volumetric change of the target lesion), severity scores, reported quality of life (QOL), and adverse effects at 6 months after administration. RESULTS: Twenty patients (five with cystic lymphatic malformation (LM), three with kaposiform lymphangiomatosis, three with generalized lymphatic anomaly, six with Gorham-Stout disease, and three with central conducting lymphatic anomaly) were treated with sirolimus at our institution. Fifty percent of patients (10/20) demonstrated a partial response by a radiological examination and a significant improvement in disease severity and QOL scores (P = 0.0020 and P = 0.0117, respectively). Ten patients who had no reduction in lesion size (stable disease group) showed no significant improvement in disease severity and QOL scores. Eighty percent of patients (16/20) had side effects, such as stomatitis, infection, and hyperlipidemia. CONCLUSIONS: Sirolimus impacts the reduction of the lymphatic tissue volume of LMs and could lead to improvement in clinical symptoms and QOL.

The EXIT (Ex Utero Intrapartum Treatment) technique con sists of ensuring the newborn's airway while is still receiving placental support. This technique has not been standardized in developing countries. OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical outcomes of two infants who underwent the EXIT technique. CLINICAL CASE: We present two cases, one with lymphatic malformation diagnosed at 20 weeks of gestational age (WGE) and the second one, a preterm newborn with thyromegaly and polyhydramnios, diagnosed at 35 WGE. In both cases, during the C-section, the EXIT technique was performed with a team of a neonatologist, a gyne cologist, an anesthesiologist, a pediatric surgeon, an otolaryngologist, a nurse, and a respiratory therapist. In both patients, the neonatologist achieved to secure the airway through orotracheal intubation at the first attempt. In the first case, lymphatic malformation was confirmed and re ceived sclerotherapy, and the second one was diagnosed with congenital hypothyroidism which was managed with levothyroxine. The patients needed invasive mechanical ventilation for 7 and 9 days, respectively, and were discharged without respiratory complications. CONCLUSIONS: In these patients, the EXIT technique was a safe procedure, carried out without inconvenience. A multi disciplinary approach and the availability of a neonatal intensive care unit are needed to reduce potential complications and ensure postnatal management. Timely prenatal diagnosis is essential to perform this technique.",

METHOD: From January 2019 to July 2021, indocyanine green lymphography was performed preoperatively to confirm the lymph inflow, and this treatment was administered in 71 patients with cervicofacial cLM in our center. All cases were evaluated by curative effects, treatment frequency, and adverse events. The duration of posttreatment follow-up was from 12 to 14 months. RESULTS: Indocyanine green lymphography indicated at least one lymphatic inflow in each cLM lesion. Excellent resolution was observed in 87.3% of cases, and good improvement of the treated cLM occurred in 9.9% of cases, and 2 cases with fair outcomes required subsequent treatment. It is noteworthy that no case was treated more than 3 times. Some minor adverse effects, including localized itch and scar, were managed by symptomatic treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Because of satisfactory outcomes and low treatment frequency, ultrasound-guided iodine tincture cauterization combined with intralesional negative pressure represents an efficacious, safe, and feasible method for the management of macro-cLM in the cervicofacial region.",
