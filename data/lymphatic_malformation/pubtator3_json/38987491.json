The frequency and timing of emergency department (ED) visits related to the event were analysed to provide data on efficacy and ideal timing of treatment. METHODS: A 5-year retrospective review of a hospital database was conducted reviewing 35 patients (15 female, 20 male; mean age 3.9 years) with macrocystic lymphatic malformations of the head and neck not involving the airway. Patients treated with oral medications were excluded. A survival analysis was performed comparing the incidence of recurrent swelling of the malformation. A Cox regression analysis was conducted using age, gender, diameter of lymphatic malformation at presentation, and echogenicity on US as covariates. Fisher's test and mean comparisons were performed to correlate the populations baselines and the number and frequency of ED visits between the 2 groups. RESULTS: Thirteen patients underwent sclerotherapy soon after initial presentation and 22 elected for observation. The two baseline populations differed at presentation with the treatment group being younger (1.4 +- 2.4 vs. 5.4 +- 6.3 years, p = 0.03) and with larger lesions (5.7 +- 2.7 vs. 4.0 +- 1.7 cm p = 0.03). Mean follow-up time was 2.7 years. Survival analysis showed 1 or multiple recurrences affected 16 patients in the untreated group and 3 patients in the treated group. (p = 0.04). Age, gender, diameter of the lesion at presentation and increased echogenicity on US were not predictive factors of recurrence. Although the probability of visiting the ED at least once did not differ between the two groups (p = 0.42), patients from the non-treatment group were more likely to visit the ED more than once (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Sclerotherapy treatment may reduce the chance of recurrent swelling or an event after initial presentation to the ED.",
