input_text: "Model-Informed individualized dosage regimen of sirolimus in pediatric
  patients with intractable lymphatic malformations. Intractable lymphatic malformations
  (iLM) pose a significant threat to affected children, demonstrating limited responses
  to conventional treatments. Sirolimus, effectively inhibiting endothelial cell proliferation
  in lymphatic vessels, plays a crucial role in iLM treatment. However, the drug's
  narrow therapeutic window and substantial interindividual variability necessitate
  customized dosing strategies. This study aims to establish a Population Pharmacokinetic
  Model (PopPK model) for sirolimus in pediatric iLM patients, identifying quantitative
  relationships between covariates and sirolimus clearance and volume of distribution.
  Initial dosages are recommended based on a target concentration range of 5-15 ng/mL.
  Retrospective data from our institution, encompassing 53 pediatric patients with
  275 blood concentration results over the past five years (average age: 4.64 +- 4.19
  years), constituted the foundation of this analysis. The final model, adopting a
  first-order absorption and elimination single-compartment model, retained age as
  the sole covariate. Results indicated a robust correlation between apparent clearance
  (CL/F) at 5.56 L/h, apparent volume of distribution (V/F) at 292.57 L, and age.
  Monte Carlo simulation guided initial dosages for patients aged 0-18 years within
  the target concentration range. This study presents the first PopPK model using
  a large Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) database to describe personalized sirolimus
  dosing for pediatric iLM patients, contributing to pharmacokinetic guidance and
  potentially improving long-term clinical outcomes."
