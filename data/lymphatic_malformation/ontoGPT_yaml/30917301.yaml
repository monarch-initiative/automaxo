input_text: 'Long-term outcome of pre- and perinatal management of congenital head
  and neck tumors and malformations. INTRODUCTION: Congenital head and neck pathology
  may cause direct postnatal airway obstruction. Prenatal diagnosis facilitates safe
  delivery with pre- and perinatal airway assessment and management and Ex-Utero-Intrapartum-Treatment
  (EXIT) if necessary. Fetoscopic airway evaluation can optimize the selection of
  patients in need of an EXIT procedure. METHODS: Description of 11 consecutive fetuses,
  born with a potential airway obstruction between 1999 and 2011 and treated at the
  University Hospitals Leuven, with a long-term follow-up until 2018. An algorithm
  including fetoscopic airway evaluation is presented. RESULTS: In utero imaging revealed
  seven teratomas, one fourth branchial pouch cyst, one thymopharyngeal duct remnant,
  one lymphatic malformation and one laryngeal atresia. A multidisciplinary team could
  avoid EXIT in eight patients by ultrasonographic (n = 2) or fetoscopic (n = 6) documentation
  of accessible airways. Three patients needed an EXIT-to-airway-procedure. Neonatal
  surgery included tracheostomy during EXIT (n = 2) and resection of teratoma (n =
  7) or branchiogenic pathology (n = 3). All patients do well at long-term (minimum
  54 months) follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Combining prenatal imaging and perinatal fetoscopy,
  EXIT-procedure and neonatal surgery yields an optimal long-term outcome in these
  complex patients. Fetoscopy can dramatically reduce the number of EXIT-procedures.'
