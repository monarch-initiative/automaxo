input_text: 'Symptom Resolution and Volumetric Reduction of Abdominal Lymphatic Malformations
  With Sclerotherapy. BACKGROUND: Lymphatic malformations (LMs) are congenital and
  arise from errors in vascular embryogenesis. LMs are categorized by cyst size as
  microcystic, macrocystic, or combined. Abdominal LMs are rare. Surgical resection
  of abdominal LMs has been the mainstay of therapy, but recurrence and morbidity
  are high. We sought to determine the effectiveness of sclerotherapy treatment for
  abdominal LM. METHODS: A single-center, retrospective review from 2014 to 2018 was
  conducted evaluating pediatric patients with abdominal LM. RESULTS: Ten patients
  were included, n = 9 had macrocystic LM and one patient had combined disease. The
  average age at first treatment was 6.8 y. The most common presenting symptoms were
  abdominal distention, pain, infection, and anemia. Preprocedural imaging was performed
  for all patients; median pretreatment volume was 1572.9 cm3 (range, 67.2-13,226.4).
  LMs were accessed using ultrasound guidance and injected with opacified doxycycline.
  Patients received a mean of 7.1 sclerotherapy injections. Complications included
  intraperitoneal doxycycline extravasation (n = 1), managed conservatively, and LM
  infection (n = 1), treated with intravenous antibiotics and drainage. One patient
  went on to surgical resection due to inability gain stable intracystic access; follow-up
  ultrasonography showed no recurrence. Postprocedural imaging was available in n
  = 8. Volume decreased by 96.7% after sclerotherapy. The median remaining volume
  was 0 cm3 (range, 0-599.7) (P = 0.016). Postsclerotherapy magnetic resonance imaging
  was obtained in n = 6, with complete resolution in 83.3%. All patients had resolution
  of presenting symptoms. Follow-up duration was 12.3 mo. CONCLUSIONS: Initial results
  demonstrate that sclerotherapy is an effective and durable treatment for symptom
  resolution and volume reduction of abdominal LM.'
