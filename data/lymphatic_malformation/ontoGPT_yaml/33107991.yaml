input_text: "Active Observation as an Alternative to Invasive Treatments for Pediatric
  Head and Neck Lymphatic Malformations. OBJECTIVES: An increasing number of treatment
  modalities for lymphatic malformations are being described, complicating therapeutic
  decisions. Understanding lymphatic malformation natural history is essential. We
  describe management of head and neck lymphatic malformations where decisions primarily
  addressed lesion-induced functional compromise (ie, breathing, swallowing) to identify
  factors associated with invasive treatment and active observation. We hypothesize
  that non-function threatening malformations can be observed. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective
  case series. METHODS: Retrospective case series of consecutive head and neck lymphatic
  malformation patients (2000-2017) with over 2 years of follow-up. Patient characteristics
  were summarized and associations with invasive treatment (surgery or sclerotherapy)
  tested using Fisher's exact. In observed patients, factors associated with spontaneous
  regression were assessed with Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: Of 191 patients, 101
  (53%) were male, 97 (51%) Caucasian, and 98 (51.3%) younger than 3 months. Malformations
  were de Serres I-III 167 (87%), or IV-V 24 (12%), and commonly located in the neck
  (101, 53%), or oral cavity (36, 19%). Initial treatments included observation (65,
  34%) or invasive treatments such as primary surgery (80, 42%), staged surgery (25,
  13%), or primary sclerotherapy (9, 5%). Of 65 initially observed malformations,
  8 (12%) subsequently had invasive treatment, 36 (58%) had spontaneous regression,
  and 21 (32%) elected for no invasive therapy. Spontaneous regression was associated
  with location in the lateral neck (P = .003) and macrocystic malformations (P =
  .017). CONCLUSION: Head and neck lymphatic malformation treatment selection can
  be individualized after stratifying by stage, presence of functional compromise,
  and consideration of natural history. Recognizing the spectrum of severity is essential
  in evaluating efficacy of emerging treatments, as selected malformations may respond
  to observation. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4 Laryngoscope, 131:1392-1397, 2021."
