input_text: 'A Radiologic Grading System for Assessing the Radiographic Outcome of
  Treatment in Lymphatic and Lymphatic-Venous Malformations of the Head and Neck.
  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Two-thirds of lymphatic malformations in children are found
  in the head and neck. Although conventionally managed through surgical resection,
  percutaneous sclerotherapy has gained popularity. No reproducible grading system
  has been designed to compare sclerotherapy outcomes on the basis of radiologic findings.
  We propose an MR imaging-based grading scale to assess the response to sclerotherapy
  and present an evaluation of its interrater reliability. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
  A grading system was developed to stratify treatment outcomes on the basis of interval
  changes observed on MR imaging. By means of this system, 56 consecutive cases from
  our institution with formally diagnosed head and neck lymphatic malformations treated
  by sclerotherapy were retrospectively graded. Each patient underwent pre- and posttreatment
  MR imaging. Each study was evaluated by 3 experienced neuroradiologists. Interrater
  reliability was assessed using the Krippendorff alpha statistic, intraclass coefficient,
  and 2-way Spearman rho correlation. RESULTS: The overall Krippendorff alpha statistic
  was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.89-0.95), denoting excellent agreement among raters. Intraclass
  coefficients with respect to consistency and absolute agreements were both 0.97
  (95% CI, 0.96-0.98), illustrating low variability. Every combination of individual
  rater pairs demonstrated statistically significant (P < .01) linear Spearman rho
  correlations, with values ranging from 0.90 to 0.95. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed radiographic
  grading scale demonstrates excellent interrater reliability. Adoption of this new
  scale can standardize reported outcomes following sclerotherapy for head and neck
  lymphatic malformation and may aid in the investigation of future questions regarding
  optimal management of these lesions.'
