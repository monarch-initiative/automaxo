input_text: "[Ex-Utero Intrapartum Treatment for airway management in congenital giant
  neck masses]. INTRODUCTION: Congenital head and neck masses are associated with
  perinatal asphyxia and brain injury, increasing the risk of death. The EXIT (Ex
  Utero Intrapartum Treatment) technique con sists of ensuring the newborn's airway
  while is still receiving placental support. This technique has not been standardized
  in developing countries. OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical outcomes of two infants
  who underwent the EXIT technique. CLINICAL CASE: We present two cases, one with
  lymphatic malformation diagnosed at 20 weeks of gestational age (WGE) and the second
  one, a preterm newborn with thyromegaly and polyhydramnios, diagnosed at 35 WGE.
  In both cases, during the C-section, the EXIT technique was performed with a team
  of a neonatologist, a gyne cologist, an anesthesiologist, a pediatric surgeon, an
  otolaryngologist, a nurse, and a respiratory therapist. In both patients, the neonatologist
  achieved to secure the airway through orotracheal intubation at the first attempt.
  In the first case, lymphatic malformation was confirmed and re ceived sclerotherapy,
  and the second one was diagnosed with congenital hypothyroidism which was managed
  with levothyroxine. The patients needed invasive mechanical ventilation for 7 and
  9 days, respectively, and were discharged without respiratory complications. CONCLUSIONS:
  In these patients, the EXIT technique was a safe procedure, carried out without
  inconvenience. A multi disciplinary approach and the availability of a neonatal
  intensive care unit are needed to reduce potential complications and ensure postnatal
  management. Timely prenatal diagnosis is essential to perform this technique."
