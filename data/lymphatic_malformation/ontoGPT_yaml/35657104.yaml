input_text: 'Delaying Invasive Treatment in Unilateral Head and Neck Lymphatic Malformation
  Improves Outcomes. OBJECTIVES: Large (De Serres stage [IV-V]) head and neck lymphatic
  malformations (HNLMs) often have multiple, high-risk, invasive treatments (ITs)
  to address functional compromise. Logically reducing HNLM ITs should reduce treatment
  risk. We tested whether delaying HNLM ITs reduces total IT number. MATERIALS: Consecutive
  HNLM patients (n = 199) between 2010 and 2017, aged 0-18 years. METHODS: ITs (surgery
  or sclerotherapy) were offered for persistent or dysfunction causing HNLMs. Treatment
  effectiveness categorized by IT number: optimal (0-1), acceptable (2-5), or suboptimal
  (>5). Clinical data were summarized, and outcome associations tested (chi2 ). Relative
  risk (RR) with a Poisson working model tested whether HNLM observation or IT delay
  (>6 months post-diagnosis) predicts treatment success (i.e., <=1 IT). RESULTS: Median
  age at HNLM diagnosis was 1.3 months (interquartile range [IQR] 0-45 m) with 107/199(54%)
  male. HNLM were stage I-III (174 [88%]), IV-V (25 [13%]). Initial treatment was
  observation (70 [35%]), invasive (129 [65%]). Treatment outcomes were optimal (137
  [69%]), acceptable (36 [18%]), and suboptimal (26 [13%]). Suboptimal outcome associations:
  EXIT procedure, stage IV-V, oral location, and tracheotomy (p < 0.001). Stage I-III
  HNLMs were initially observed compared with stage I-III having ITs within 6 months
  of HNLM diagnosis, had a 82% lower relative treatment failure risk ([i.e., >1 IT],
  RR = 0.09, 95% CI 0.02-0.36, p < 0.001). Stage I-III HNLMs with non-delayed ITs
  had reduced treatment failure risk compared with IV-V (RR = 0.47, 95% CI 0.33-0.66,
  p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Observation and delayed IT in stage I-III HNLM ("Grade 1")
  is safe and reduces IT (i.e., <=1 IT). Stage IV-V HNLMs ("Grade 2") with early IT
  have a greater risk of multiple ITs. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4 Laryngoscope, 133:956-962,
