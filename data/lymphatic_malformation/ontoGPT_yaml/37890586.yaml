input_text: 'Intralesional injection of bleomycin in the management of low flow vascular
  malformations: results and factors affecting the outcome. BACKGROUND: Ethanol has
  been a commonly used sclerosant for low flow vascular malformations, but it carries
  a high risk of complications. Bleomycin has been recently introduced as a potentially
  effective treatment. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety
  and efficacy of bleomycin intralesional injection for the treatment of low flow
  vascular malformations and determine the different factors affecting the outcome.
  PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of fifty patients with low flow vascular malformations
  were enrolled in the study between April 2020 and March 2022. All the patient underwent
  preoperative duplex ultrasound and magnetic resonant angiography. The procedure
  was performed under ultrasound and fluoroscopic guidance. All the patients were
  assessed for the objective improvement, ultrasound assessment, and patient reported
  outcome. RESULTS: The overall rate of objective improvement was 79.53% (78.05 in
  venous and 87.5% in lymphatic malformations), while 81.25% of the patients showed
  a degree of size reduction or complete obliteration on postoperative ultrasound.
  The patient-reported outcome analysis showed a statistically significant improvement
  in the mean score for the pain, overall symptoms, and self-confidence. On regression
  analysis, the only factor associated with poor objective outcome was diffuse lesions
  (ill-defined or extending in more than one body region or one compartment). No major
  complications were recorded. CONCLUSION: Bleomycin intralesional injection is a
  safe and effective treatment for low-flow vascular malformations.'
