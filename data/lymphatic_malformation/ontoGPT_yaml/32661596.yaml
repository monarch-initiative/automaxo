input_text: 'Lymphatic malformations compromising the upper airway in children: ultrasound-guided
  intralesional focal sclerotherapy with bleomycin targeting culprit lesions. PURPOSE:
  Lymphatic malformations (LMs) compromising the upper airway is a life-threatening
  and intractable disease. Here, we establish a novel method to perform intralesional
  focal sclerotherapy targeting the culprit for airway stenosis. METHODS: Between
  July 2015 and February 2020, 11 patients with airway-compromising LMs were enrolled.
  To yield maximal effects on the compromised airway with minimal adverse effects,
  ultrasound-guided intralesional bleomycin sclerotherapy assisted by balloon was
  performed, aimed at the most responsible lesion around the airway. A retrospective
  analysis was performed. RESULTS: Ten patients presented with respiratory symptoms,
  eight of whom required airway support. The last asymptomatic patient showed airway
  compression on magnetic resonance imaging. The dose of bleomycin injected ranged
  from 1.3-9 mg per patient per course. A median of one course was required for withdrawal
  from airway support, and the median time was 15 days. A median of two courses was
  required to eliminate the lesion adjacent to the airway, which would have potential
  risk of airway stenosis. No complications were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our intralesional
  focal sclerotherapy technique with bleomycin targeting the culprit lesion is dose-sparing,
  safe, and effective in achieving rapid shrinkage of LMs compromising the upper airway
  in children, thereby avoiding tracheostomy.'
