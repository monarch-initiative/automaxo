input_text: 'Successful Treatment of Vaginal and Pelvic Microcystic Lymphatic Malformation
  with 50% Ethanol Injection via Lymph Node Angiography. BACKGROUND: Clinically, surgical
  treatment and sclerotherapy are the main treatments for lymphatic malformation (LM),
  but the diagnosis and treatment of microcystic LM has numerous pitfalls. Microcystic
  LM within the vagina and pelvis is not easily visible, and there are many side effects
  of treatment. Lymphangiography, a relatively old method of identifying diseases
  of the lymphatic system, has been rarely used in clinical settings because of the
  difficulty of performing this test. In this article, we describe the use of a special
  lesion site adjacent to the nearby lymph nodes for the treatment of vaginal and
  pelvic microcystic LM. CASE: Lymphangiography was performed using lymph node aspiration
  combined with direct local puncture of the lesion, guided by the injection of iodine
  oil, which can produce a better outcome and more complete removal of the lesion.
  Finally, sclerotherapy was conducted using a low concentration of 50% ethanol with
  good fluidity, which covered the lesion to a great extent. This methodology was
  shown to be effective in treating children with vaginal and pelvic microcystic LM.'
