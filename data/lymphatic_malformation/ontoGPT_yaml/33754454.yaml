input_text: 'Long-term outcomes of pediatric and young adult patients receiving radiotherapy
  for nonmalignant vascular anomalies. BACKGROUND: Nonmalignant vascular anomalies
  (VA) comprise a heterogeneous spectrum of conditions characterized by aberrant growth
  or development of blood and/or lymphatic vessels and can cause significant morbidity.
  Little is known about outcomes after radiotherapy in pediatric and young adult patients
  with nonmalignant VA. METHODS: Thirty patients who were diagnosed with nonmalignant
  VA and treated with radiotherapy prior to 2017 and before the age of 30 were identified.
  Clinical and treatment characteristics and outcomes were recorded. RESULTS: Median
  age at first radiotherapy was 15 years (range 0.02-27). Median follow-up from completion
  of first radiotherapy was 9.8 years (range 0.02-67.4). Lymphatic malformations (33%),
  kaposiform hemangioendothelioma (17%), and venous malformations (17%) were the most
  common diagnoses. The most common indication for first radiotherapy was progression
  despite standard therapy and/or urgent palliation for symptoms (57%). After first
  radiotherapy, 14 patients (47%) had a complete response or partial response, defined
  as decrease in size of treated lesion or symptomatic improvement. After first radiotherapy,
  27 (90%) required additional treatment for progression or recurrence. Long-term
  complications included telangiectasias, fibrosis, xerophthalmia, radiation pneumonitis,
  ovarian failure, and central hypothyroidism. No patient developed secondary malignancies.
  At last follow-up, three patients (10%) were without evidence of disease, 26 (87%)
  with disease, and one died of complications (3.3%). CONCLUSIONS: A small group of
  pediatric and young adult patients with nonmalignant, high-risk VA experienced clinical
  benefit from radiotherapy with expected toxicity; however, most experienced progression.
  Prospective studies are needed to characterize indications for radiotherapy in VA
  refractory to medical therapy, including targeted inhibitors.'
