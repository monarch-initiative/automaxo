input_text: "A nomogram for predicting sclerotherapy response for treatment of lymphatic
  malformations in children. PURPOSE: In this manuscript, we purposed to identify
  the prognostic factors for treatment of lymphatic malformations in children using
  polidocanol foam combined with pingyangmycin and to construct nomogram for predicting
  sclerotherapy response. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 77 children having
  LMs who underwent sclerotherapy using polidocanol foam combined with pingyangmycin
  under ultrasound display from January 2017 to April 2020 was done. The clinical
  response was graded as excellent (>= 90%), good (>= 50%, < 90%), and poor (< 50%).
  More than 50% was considered as acceptable response. Prognostic factors were identified
  by Pearson's Chi-square or Fisher's exact test and multivariable logistic regression
  model was used to construct a nomogram to predict sclerotherapy response. The discrimination
  and calibration of nomogram were verified through the receiver operating characteristic
  cure and calibration plots. RESULTS: The mean number of treatment sessions was 3.1
  (range, 1-6). Among 77 patients, 58 patients (75.3%) had excellent response to treatment
  (>= 90%) and 68 patients (88.3%) had an acceptable response (>= 50%, < 90%). Clinical
  disfigurement (P = 0.014), skin discoloration (P = 0.040), morphological subtype
  (P < 0.001) and extent of the lesion (P < 0.001) correlated with clinical response
  to sclerotherapy in LMs. Sclerotherapy response was predicted through nomogram constructed
  in this study, which shows good calibration and discrimination. Also, focal lesion
  and macrocystic or mixed morphological subtype lesion were seen more often in lower
  number of treatment sessions among the patients with excellent response. CONCLUSIONS:
  An acceptable response to sclerotherapy using polidocanol foam combined with pingyangmycin
  was achieved in majority of LMs in children with extremely low complication rates.
  Nomogram based on the prognostic factors of sclerotherapy response for LMs in children
  was shown to possess an excellent performance to predict the probability of LMs
  sclerotherapy response."
