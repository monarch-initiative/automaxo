input_text: 'Primary targeted medical therapy for management of bilateral head and
  neck lymphatic malformations in infants. OBJECTIVES: Patients born with bilateral
  head and neck lymphatic malformations (BHNLMs) often require multiple invasive treatments,
  including tracheostomy. We hypothesized that primary targeted medical therapy (pTMT)
  with diagnostic needle aspiration reduces the need for invasive therapy such as
  surgical resection and/or sclerotherapy. METHODS: Retrospective case review was
  performed of infants with BHNLMs (Grade 2 or De Serres stage IV and V) treated only
  at our institution from 2000 to 2021. Patients were divided into two cohorts: those
  managed with pTMT and those managed with observation, sclerotherapy, or surgical
  intervention (non-pTMT). Data regarding interventions, clinical outcomes, morbidity,
  and mortality were analyzed with descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Nine children
  with BHNLMs met inclusion criteria. Three (33%) were in the pTMT cohort and six
  (66%) were non-pTMT. Eight (89%) malformations were genotyped, and all demonstrated
  hotspot PIK3CA variants. All pTMT patients had sirolimus initiated in the first
  month of life and underwent needle aspiration of malformation cyst fluid for cell-free
  DNA samples. All pTMT patients tolerated medical therapy. For the non-pTMT cohort,
  primary treatment included none (deceased, n = 1, 17%), observation with needle
  aspiration (n = 1, 17%), surgical resection (n = 2, 33%), or combination surgery
  and sclerotherapy (n = 2, 33%). Intubation duration, intensive care and initial
  hospital length of stay were not different between cohorts. Four non-pTMT patients
  (67%) required tracheostomy, and two (33%) died prior to discharge. All pTMT patients
  survived and none required tracheostomy. Non-pTMT patients required a median of
  two invasive therapies prior to discharge (IQR 1-4) and a mean total of 13 over
  the course of their lifetime (IQR 1-16), compared to the pTMT group who did not
  require any lifetime invasive therapy, even after initial pTMT and discharge home.
  CONCLUSION: This study compares patients with BHNLMs (Grade 2) treated with pTMT
  versus those treated with observation or invasive therapy. Patients treated with
  pTMT required no surgical or invasive procedural treatment of their malformations,
  no tracheostomy placement, no unplanned readmissions after discharge, and had no
  mortalities. Needle aspiration was useful as a therapeutic adjunct for cell-free
  DNA diagnosis of PIK3CA variants, which guided TMT.'
