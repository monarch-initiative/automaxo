input_text: 'Cervical lymphatic malformations: Prenatal characteristics and ex utero
  intrapartum treatment. BACKGROUND: The ex utero intrapartum treatment (EXIT) is
  utilized to transition fetuses with prenatally diagnosed airway obstruction to postnatal
  life. We describe the unique clinical course, diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes
  of patients with cervical lymphatic malformation (CLM) managed with EXIT. METHODS:
  Review of fetuses with diagnosed CLM was delivered by EXIT (2001-2018) in a tertiary
  referral fetal center. Outcomes included survival, tracheostomy at discharge, neonatal
  course after delivery, and pulmonary hypoplasia. Data are reported as median [range]
  and rate (%). RESULTS: Out of 45 patients delivered by EXIT, 10 were delivered for
  CLM: seven had polyhydramnios, one had nonimmune hydrops, five delivered preterm,
  and three were emergency EXITs. The EXIT time and estimated blood loss were 125
  minutes (95, 158) and 900 mL (500, 1500), respectively. Airway was secured in all.
  There was one neonatal death (day 8) with prematurity, sepsis, and pulmonary hypoplasia.
  Three out of nine were discharged with a tracheostomy. CONCLUSION: In CLM, close
  monitoring for structural neck involvement and development of polyhydramnios are
  important and may be an indication for EXIT as the optimal delivery mode. An experienced
  multidisciplinary team is a key factor for an effective approach to the obstructed
  airway in CLM.'
