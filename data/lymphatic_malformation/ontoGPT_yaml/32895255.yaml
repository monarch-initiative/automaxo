input_text: Fourth branchial pouch anomaly presenting as a neonatal neck lump. A 1-week-old
  female infant presented with a transilluminating neck lump that increased in size
  with crying. The presumptive diagnosis was lymphatic malformation, but imaging raised
  the possibility of an abscess or necrotic tumour. A biopsy revealed a likely developmental
  cyst with local inflammatory change. Microlaryngoscopy revealed a fourth branchial
  pouch sinus, which was cauterised. The sinus and neck lump resolved without need
  for further treatment.
