input_text: 'Lymphatic malformations in children: retrospective review of surgical
  and interventional management. PURPOSE: Lymphatic malformations (LMs) are classified
  as macrocystic, microcystic or mixed. Treatment depends on their characteristics:
  surgery, sclerotherapy, both combined, systemic treatment or observation. This study
  aims to analyze the surgical and interventional management of LMs in children over
  the last two decades in our university hospital. METHODS: Management of children
  born with LMs between 2000 and 2019 was reviewed. Parameters collected were: malformation
  characteristics, type of treatment, symptoms, imaging, timing of diagnosis and first
  treatment, number of interventions, recovery rate, complications and length of stay.
  RESULTS: Files of 48 children were reviewed: 27 with macrocystic and 21 with microcystic
  LMs. There was no statistically significant difference in type of treatment except
  for combined treatment, more performed in microcystic LMs (p = 0.04). Symptoms,
  imaging, timing of diagnosis and first treatment, number of interventions and complications
  were not statistically significant. Overall, the number of surgeries was lower than
  sclerotherapies (p = 0.04). Recovery rate after surgery was higher in macrocystic
  LMs (p = 0.01). Complications and length of stay were not statistically significant.
  CONCLUSION: A good rate of recovery was observed when surgery was performed, with
  no significant increase in complications and length of stay. A prospective study
  will be determinant to create a decisional algorithm for children with LMs.'
