input_text: 'Ultrasonographic diagnosis, classification, and treatment of cervical
  lymphatic malformation in paediatric patients: a retrospective study. BACKGROUND:
  To explore the imaging features, key diagnostic points, classification, treatment,
  and prognosis of cervical lymphatic malformation. METHODS: Overall, 320 patients
  diagnosed with cervical lymphatic malformation were retrospectively analysed in
  our hospital between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2017. Imaging modalities included
  colour Doppler ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, and contrast-enhanced computed
  tomography. Cervical lymphatic malformations were classified by cyst diameter. Treatments
  included interventional therapy, surgery, and expectant treatment. RESULTS: Cervical
  lymphatic malformation was identified in 320 of 1192 patients with lymphatic malformation.
  Four were excluded due to misdiagnosis by ultrasonography. Cervical lymphatic malformation
  was classified as mixed, macrocystic, and microcystic in 184 (57.5%), 117 (36.56%),
  and 19 (5.94%) patients, respectively. Sixty-four (20%), ten (3.12%), seven (2.19%),
  and three (0.94%) patients experienced intracystic haemorrhage, infection, concurrent
  intracystic haemorrhage and infection, and calcification, respectively. Among 260
  (81.25%) patients who underwent interventional sclerotherapy, 163 (50.94%) received
  it once and 96 (30%) received it two or more times. Twenty-eight (8.75%), five (1.56%),
  and 27 (8.44%) patients underwent surgical resection, interventional sclerotherapy
  plus surgery, and expectant management, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasonography
  is useful for diagnosing definite cervical lymphatic malformation. Interventional
  therapy is the first choice for children with confirmed cervical lymphatic malformation.'
