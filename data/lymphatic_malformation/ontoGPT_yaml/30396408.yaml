input_text: Fetal Evaluation and Airway Management. Congenital causes of airway obstruction
  once noted at birth are now diagnosed prenatally. The adoption of ex utero intrapartum
  treatment has allowed for planned airway stabilization on placental support, dramatically
  decreasing the incidence of hypoxic injury or peripartum demise related to neonatal
  airway obstruction. Airway access is gained either through laryngoscopy, bronchoscopy,
  or a surgical airway. In complete airway obstruction, primary resection of the obstructing
  lesion may be performed before completion of delivery. This article reviews the
  current and emerging methods of fetal evaluation, indications for ex utero intrapartum
  treatment, and provides a detailed description of the procedure and necessary personnel.
