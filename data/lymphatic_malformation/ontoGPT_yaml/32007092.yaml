input_text: 'Retroperitoneal lymphatic malformation in a dog. BACKGROUND: Lymphatic
  vascular malformations are rare findings in canine patients with six reports available
  in veterinary literature. Retroperitoneal cystic lymphatic malformations have not
  been described previously in canine patients and neither has the use of immunohistochemistry
  to determine their origin, i.e. vascular versus lymphatic. CASE PRESENTATION: An
  8-year-old neutered female Cocker spaniel was referred for pollakiuria, dysuria
  and a painful abdomen. Computed tomography scanning of the abdomen showed a fluid
  filled structure adjacent to the urinary bladder. During surgical exploration, a
  thin walled cystic structure with sero-haemorrhagic fluid was found, extending from
  the retroperitoneal space into the abdomen. The mass was excised and submitted for
  histopathology, revealing a cystic mass lined by a fibrovascular capsule within
  the retroperitoneal/mesenteric adipose tissue. The inner surface of the cyst was
  lined by a single layer of bland, flattened spindle cells. Intramural blood vessels
  were well differentiated, with perivascular haemorrhage. On recurrence 11 months
  later, the mass was excised for the second time and a PleuralPort (Norfolk Animal
  products) was placed. Fifteen months after initial presentation, progression occurred
  with haemorrhagic fluid in the cystic space, pleural- and abdominal cavities and
  the owners opted for euthanasia. Histopathology and positive immunohistochemistry
  for lymphatic markers lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronic acid receptor-1 (LYVE-1)
  and prospero homeobox protein-1 (PROX-1) confirmed a lymphatic vascular origin of
  the cystic structure. CONCLUSIONS: To our experience, a definitive diagnosis of
  retroperitoneal cystic malformation of lymphatic origin could be done only by combining
  the clinical presentation, advanced imaging, histopathology and LYVE-1 and PROX-1
  immunohistochemistry. This is the first report of a vascular malformation in a dog
  where immunohistochemistry was used to make a final diagnosis. A lymphatic malformation,
  even if rare, should be added on the list of the differential diagnosis in a patient
  with a retroperitoneal cystic structure containing serohaemorrhagic fluid. Results
  of this case report can aid in diagnosis of future cases, however, further studies
  on therapy and management are needed to provide additional information about optimal
  treatment of these patients.'
