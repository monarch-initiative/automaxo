input_text: 'Preoperative n-BCA embolization in the resection of submandibular lymphatic
  malformations refractory to sclerotherapy treatment: A pilot case series. OBJECTIVE:
  Lymphatic malformations in the submandibular neck pose unique challenges to treatment
  that elevate their risk of recurrence. This case series provides a review of five
  patients, previously treated with sclerotherapy or with a history of multiple infections,
  who were treated in a novel fashion: single-stage resection using preoperative n-butyl
  cyanoacrylate (n-BCA) glue embolization. METHODS: We performed a retrospective medical
  record review of five patients who underwent single-stage n-BCA embolization by
  Interventional Radiology followed by surgical resection by Otolaryngology, including
  a review of their symptoms, previous treatments, and post-treatment surveillance,
  with follow-up ranging from 4 to 24 months after the treatment of interest. RESULTS:
  All study subjects had unremarkable perioperative courses, and four patients did
  not demonstrate any evidence of disease recurrence or persistence during the follow-up
  period. One patient was found to have a small area of persistent disease on post-treatment
  imaging, but has remained symptom free. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of submandibular
  lymphatic malformations with n-BCA embolization followed by surgical resection can
  be performed in a single stage. This case series demonstrates that this approach
  can yield durable relief of symptoms, even in patients whose lesions were refractory
  to previous treatments.'
