input_text: Cerebrospinal fluid-lymphatic fistula in a child with generalized lymphatic
  anomaly treated with targeted blood patch - a rare case report and review of the
  literature. Spontaneous intracranial hypotension may result in debilitating postural
  headaches and severe neurological symptoms due to secondary cerebellar sagging.
  The most common cause is the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak within the spinal canal.
  Although previously reported in only a few cases, also paraspinal lymphatic malformations
  causing vertebral bone destruction may occasionally result in CSF leak to these
  pathological formations. Here, we present a case of a 9-year-old girl with generalized
  lymphatic anomaly (GLA) presenting with severe postural headache. Radiological imaging
  revealed a typical feature of cerebellar sagging. Myelography localized the CSF
  leakage into vertebral bodies of C7 and Th1, which both were partly involved in
  pathological paravertebral masses of known lymphatic anomaly, and from there along
  the right C8 nerve root sleeve into the anomaly. As the C8-nerve root could not
  be ligated due to the risk of significant neurological injury, we attempted image-guided
  targeted percutaneous epidural placement of a blood patch directly into the foramen
  at the affected level. The procedure resulted in obliteration of the fistula and
  regression of cerebellar sagging, with significant relief of symptoms. Although
  it is an extremely rare coincidence, patients with paraspinal lymphatic malformations
  may develop intraspinal CSF leak into these pathological formations. The present
  case report suggests that besides a direct surgical obliteration of the fistula
  and sacrificing the nerve root, a targeted percutaneous epidural blood patch may
  be a possible alternative in the case of a functionally important nerve root.
