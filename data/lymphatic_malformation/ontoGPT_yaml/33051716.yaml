input_text: 'Lymphatic malformations in children: treatment outcomes of sclerotherapy
  in a large cohort. This retrospective study examines the outcomes of sclerotherapy
  in children with (veno)lymphatic malformations who received sclerotherapy between
  2011 and 2016 (116 children, 234 procedures). Complication severity was classified
  using the Society of Interventional Radiology classification. Clinical response
  was rated on a scale of 0 (no change) to 3 (good improvement). The sclerosants used
  were bleomycin (n = 132; 56%), lauromacrogol (n = 42; 18%), doxycycline (n = 15;
  6%), ethanol (n = 12; 5%), or a combination (n = 33; 14%). Four major and 25 minor
  complications occurred without significant differences between the agents. The median
  response rate per procedure was 2-some improvement-for all sclerosants. However,
  in pure LMs (67%), bleomycin and a combination of agents resulted in the best clinical
  response. On patient level, all had some or good clinical response. Mixed macrocystic
  and microcystic lesions showed a significantly lower clinical response (median 2
  versus 3; p = 0.023 and p = 0.036, respectively) and required significantly more
  procedures (median 2 versus 1; p = 0.043 and p = 0.044, respectively) compared with
  lesions with one component.Conclusion: Sclerotherapy for (V)LMs in children is safe
  and effective. Bleomycin is the most frequently used agent in this clinic and seemed
  most effective for pure LMs. Mixed macrocystic and microcystic lesions are most
  difficult to treat effectively. What is Known:   A variety of agents can be used
  for sclerotherapy of lymphatic malformations in children.   Macrocystic lesions
  have favorable outcomes compared with microcystic and mixed lesions. What is New:   Bleomycin
  and a combination of agents seem to be most effective to treat lymphatic malformations
  in children.   Mixed macrocystic and microcystic lesions are more difficult to treat
  effectively compared with lesions with either one of these components.'
