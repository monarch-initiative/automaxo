input_text: 'Expectant management of pediatric lymphatic malformations: A 30-year
  chart review. BACKGROUND: Lymphatic malformations (LM) are rare congenital lesions
  with varied clinical presentations, from asymptomatic to life-threatening. Regardless
  of initial presentation, many are treated aggressively either surgically or medically.
  There is a scarcity of literature regarding expectant management, this study compares
  current literature surrounding the outcomes of LMs managed conservatively to a provincial
  database in which conservative management was the primary treatment. METHODS: Retrospective
  chart review of all pediatric patients diagnosed with a lymphatic malformation in
  Newfoundland and Labrador between 1989-2019. In total, 43 patients were reviewed,
  2 were excluded due to inadequate follow up, 1 was excluded due to initial life-threatening
  presentation requiring intervention. Of these patients, 32 were managed conservatively
  without any intervention, 7 surgically, and 1 aspirated. Data extracted included
  age at referral, management, complications, clinical regression and patient satisfaction,
  years of follow up, and recurrence rate. RESULTS: Patients managed expectantly had
  partial or complete clinical regression in 81%. Anecdotal regression as reported
  by patients and family was 84%. This is compared to a 45% clinical regression with
  expectant management in the literature and a recent systematic review with a 48%
  overall regression rate with sclerotherapy [10,12]. Average follow up was 6 years
  and average time to regression was 6.6 years. No major complications were reported.
  Recurrence rate in expectant management was 0% versus 21% in surgical group. CONCLUSIONS:
  Expectant management is a safe and viable alternative to more aggressive treatments
  and ultimately leads to regression in the majority of cases. It should be considered
  as first line for non-life-threatening lymphatic malformations.'
