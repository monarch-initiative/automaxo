input_text: 'Safety and Efficacy of Bleomycin Slow Infusion Sclerotherapy Using a
  Syringe Pump for Microcystic and Mixed Lymphatic Malformations. PURPOSE: To evaluate
  the safety and efficacy of bleomycin infusion sclerotherapy using a syringe pump
  in microcystic and mixed (microcystic components with the presence of a cyst over
  1 cm) lymphatic malformations (LMs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients who received
  bleomycin sclerotherapy with a syringe pump for microcystic or mixed LMs were reviewed.
  Cystic components of LMs were accessed under sonographic guidance, followed by injection
  of an opacified bleomycin solution using a syringe pump (infusion rate, 10-20 mL/h)
  under fluoroscopic guidance. Imaging outcomes were graded as complete (> 90% size
  reduction), partial (25-90%), or no response (< 25%). Clinical outcomes and procedure-related
  complications were also reviewed. RESULTS: Forty-nine patients with 81 sclerotherapies
  were analyzed. The mean age was 17 years (range 0.1-65 y). Thirty-one (63%) patients
  had microcystic LMs, and 18 (37%) had mixed. A mean of 1.7 sessions (range 1-4)
  of sclerotherapy was performed using a mean cumulative dose of bleomycin of 10.8
  U (range 1.5-39 U). The mean infusion time was 39 min (range 14-130 min). Regarding
  imaging outcomes, there was a complete response in 29% (n = 14), a partial response
  in 57% (n = 28), and no response in 14% (n = 7). Regarding clinical outcomes, there
  was a complete response in 39% (n = 19), a partial response in 51% (n = 25), and
  no response in 10% (n = 5). According to the CIRSE classification, no major complications
  were identified. CONCLUSIONS: Bleomycin slow infusion sclerotherapy provides gradual
  filling of sclerosant to target microcystic components. This technique is safe and
  feasible for the management of microcystic or mixed LMs. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level
  4, Case series.'
