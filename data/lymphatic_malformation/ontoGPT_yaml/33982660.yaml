input_text: 'Management of cervicofacial lymphatic malformations requires a multidisciplinary
  approach. BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Cervicofacial lymphatic malformations (CFLM) are rare,
  potentially life-threatening vascular anomalies, yet reports on multidisciplinary
  treatment strategies are lacking. We evaluated outcomes for CFLMs following sclerotherapy,
  surgical resection, and/or medical management. METHODS: We identified children with
  a CFLM at a vascular anomalies center from 2004 to 2019. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: retro-orbital
  malformations, untreated malformations, patients without follow-up. Primary clinical
  outcome was contour improvement, with significance defined as LM volume reduction
  of >50% by cross-sectional imaging. RESULTS: Sixty-three children met inclusion
  criteria: 35 with macrocystic CFLMs, six with microcystic CFLMs, and 22 with mixed-type
  malformations. Mean post-intervention follow-up was 27.5 months. Fifty-eight patients
  underwent sclerotherapy (median: two treatments). Doxycycline and/or bleomycin were
  used in 95% of patients. After sclerotherapy, 97% of macrocystic CFLMs improved
  significantly compared to 82% of mixed and 67% of microcystic lesions. Sixteen children
  underwent surgical resection with 75% significantly improving; two additional patients
  were successfully treated with sclerotherapy after debulking surgery. Six children
  received sirolimus for microcystic disease, of which 33% significantly improved.
  CONCLUSION: Sclerotherapy is very effective for macrocystic components of CFLMs,
  albeit less so for microcystic disease. Microcystic CFLMs frequently require surgical
  resection. Sirolimus is a helpful therapeutic adjunct, particularly for microcystic
  lesions, but more study is needed. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, prognosis study.'
