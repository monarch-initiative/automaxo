input_text: 'Risk factors for sequelae after surgery for lymphatic malformations in
  children. OBJECTIVE: The first-line treatment of lymphatic malformations (LMs) is
  pharmacological or interventional; however, surgery is still necessary in selected
  cases. Our aim was to identify factors associated with the occurrence of permanent
  postoperative complications. METHODS: This was a case series study of children operated
  on for LMs between 2001 and 2021 and followed-up in our institution. Patients who
  presented sequelae derived from surgical treatment (cases) and those who did not
  (controls) were compared. RESULTS: We included 112 children who underwent surgery
  for LMs in different centers. Forty-nine cases and 63 controls were included (58%
  male), with a mean age of 34 months. Patients younger than 1 year presented more
  complications than older children, 59% (n = 29/49) vs 41% (n = 24/49), respectively
  (P = .02). LMs were in the cervicofacial region in seven patients in the control
  group compared with 30 of the cases (P <= .001), with microcystic malformations
  the most associated with sequelae (n = 11/15; P = .019). Concerning permanent complications,
  88% were neurological (n = 43/49), mainly peripheral facial palsy (n = 17). There
  was greater postoperative residual disease in controls compared with cases (65%
  vs 14%, respectively; P <= .0001). However, following a second procedure in the
  control group, there was no significant difference in long-term cure rates (P =
  .38). CONCLUSIONS: The risk of sequelae following surgery for LM increases significantly
  in patients younger than 12 months in cervicofacial and microcystic malformations.
  Because non-radical resections are associated with fewer complications and an optimal
  long-term cure rate, we consider that aggressive surgical approaches should be avoided
  if the absence of sequelae is not guaranteed.'
