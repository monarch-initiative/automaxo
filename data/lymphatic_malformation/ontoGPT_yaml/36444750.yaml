input_text: 'Curettage and sclerotherapy technique: A hybrid approach to superficial
  lymphatic malformation. OBJECTIVE: To describe the curettage and sclerotherapy technique,
  a hybrid approach to treatment for superficial lymphatic malformations. METHODS:
  A retrospective analysis of a lymphatic malformation data base was performed. Patients
  with superficial lymphatic malformation treated by curettage and sclerotherapy technique
  with bleomycin were included in this study. Safety and efficacy of the curettage
  and sclerotherapy technique with bleomycin were evaluated. RESULTS: Between September
  2019 and October 2021, 10 consecutive patients (male/female ratio: 4:6; mean age,
  10.9 years; range, 3-35 years) presented with superficial lymphatic malformations
  that were subsequently treated by curettage and sclerotherapy technique with bleomycin.
  All lesions were located on the trunk and extremities. Each patient received one
  treatment session and a mean follow-up of 12 months. We observed minor complications.
  No postoperative infections occurred in this series. No patient developed skin ulceration
  or necrosis. Scarring and recurrence occurred in one patient. Complete regression
  was confirmed for all 10 patients by photographic evaluation. CONCLUSION: A curettage
  and sclerotherapy technique is proposed to treat superficial lymphatic malformation
  in this study. This technique seems to be safe and highly effective.'
