input_text: 'Oral rapamycin: an alternative in children with complicated vascular
  abnormalities. OBJECTIVE: Sirolimus mTOR inhibitor represents a major advance in
  the treatment of patients with complicated vascular abnormalities. The objective
  of this study was to present our series of pediatric patients with vascular abnormalities
  treated with oral sirolimus, and to conduct a review of the relevant literature.
  MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of patients with complicated vascular
  abnormalities treated with oral sirolimus in our healthcare facility from 2016 was
  carried out. Initial dosage was 0.8 mg/m2 every 12 hours, and therapeutic range
  was 5-15 ng/ml. All patients received trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis.
  RESULTS: 6 children -3 boys and 3 girls- with a mean age of 9.5 years at treatment
  initiation were included. 3 of them had head and neck lymphatic malformation, 2
  had lower limb venous malformation, and 1 had combined lymphatic-venous malformation
  at the thoracoabdominal level. They all had received multiple previous treatments
  without improvement. Following sirolimus initiation, 5 patients had clinical improvement
  (mean time: 3.6 months) and 4 had radiological improvement (mean time: 6.6 months).
  Mild and transitory adverse effects were noted in the 3 cases. Today, 5 patients
  remain under treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Oral sirolimus is an effective and safe treatment
  in patients with complicated vascular abnormalities. Our results support sirolimus
  use in lymphatic and venous malformations in which previous treatments have failed,
  with a good symptomatic and, to a lesser extent, radiological response.'
