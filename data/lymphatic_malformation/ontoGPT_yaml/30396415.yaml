input_text: Vascular Anomalies. Classified by their most prominent vessel type, congenital
  vascular tumors and malformations are frequently evident neonatally. Although many
  are identified in the first month of life, management is often delayed due to their
  slow expansion. Urgent interventions may be necessary in fast-growing, obstructive,
  destructive, or bleeding anomalies. Treatment is based on the impact on vital structures,
  impending aesthetic outcome, or functional risks. Frequent and fast-growing hemangiomas
  and lymphatic malformations are the most commonly treated neonatally. This article
  reviews lesions that might require early intervention, including hemangiomas, lymphatic
  and venous malformations, and the rare kaposiform hemangioendothelioma.
