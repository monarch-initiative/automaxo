input_text: 'Peripelvic Lymphatic Malformation Presenting With Gross Hematuria and
  Renal Colic: A Case Report. Renal lymphangectasia is a benign malformation of the
  lymphatics which can be perirenal or peripelvic in location. Diagnosis is made on
  imaging including ultrasound, computed tomography , or MRI. We present an unusual
  case of renal lymphangectasia presenting with gross hematuria and flank pain diagnosed
  on computed tomography.'
