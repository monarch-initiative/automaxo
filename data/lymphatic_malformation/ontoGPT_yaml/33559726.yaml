input_text: 'Intra-abdominal lymphatic malformation management in light of the updated
  International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies classification. BACKGROUND:
  The International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies (ISSVA) classification
  distinguishes between common lymphatic malformations and complex lymphatic anomalies.
  These entities have overlapping features but differing responses to treatment. Surgery
  has been the mainstream treatment in intra-abdominal lymphatic malformation, with
  variable reported success in the literature. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was
  to review the outcome of different treatments for intra-abdominal lymphatic malformations
  in children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all intra-abdominal
  lymphatic malformations from 1999 to 2019 in children treated by the surgical team
  or followed in the vascular anomalies clinic of our institution. Children were classified
  into one of three groups: group A, isolated intra-abdominal lymphatic malformation;
  group B, common lymphatic malformation in continuity with other regions; or group
  C, intra-abdominal involvement as part of a complex lymphatic anomaly or associated
  syndrome. RESULTS: Fifty intra-abdominal lymphatic malformations were diagnosed;
  five of these were excluded. In group A (n=28), the treatment was surgical resection
  (n=26) or sclerosing treatment (n=1), with one case of spontaneous regression; no
  recurrence was observed in 25 patients. In group B (n=7), three patients had partial
  resection and all had recurrence; four had sclerotherapy alone with good response.
  In group C (n=10), therapeutic options included surgery, sclerosing treatment and
  pharmacotherapy, with variable outcomes. CONCLUSION: The management of intra-abdominal
  malformations requires a team approach. Sclerotherapy is successful in treating
  macrocystic lymphatic malformation. Surgery is successful in treating isolated intra-abdominal
  common lymphatic malformation, albeit at times at the cost of intestinal resection,
  which could be avoided by combining surgery with preoperative sclerotherapy. With
  surgery there is often limited resectability, and therefore recurrence in intra-abdominal
  lymphatic malformations that are part of complex lymphatic anomalies associated
  with syndromes, or in common lymphatic malformations in continuity with other regions.
  Sclerotherapy is an effective modality in these instances along with pharmacotherapy.'
