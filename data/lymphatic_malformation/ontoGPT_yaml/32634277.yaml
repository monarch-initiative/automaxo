input_text: Kaposiform lymphangiomatosis treated with multimodal therapy improves
  coagulopathy and reduces blood angiopoietin-2 levels. Kaposiform lymphangiomatosis
  (KLA) is a rare, life-threatening congenital lymphatic malformation. Diagnosis is
  often delayed due to complex indistinct symptoms. Blood angiopoietin-2 (ANG2) levels
  are elevated in KLA and may be useful as a biomarker to monitor disease status.
  We report a 7-year-old male child with easy bruising, inguinal swelling, and consumptive
  coagulopathy, diagnosed with KLA. A multimodal treatment regimen of prednisone,
  sirolimus, vincristine, and adjunctive zoledronate was used. Plasma ANG2 levels
  were highly elevated at diagnosis but decreased during treatment. The patient showed
  significant clinical improvement over a 38-month period and normalization of ANG2
  levels correlated with resolution of the coagulopathy.
