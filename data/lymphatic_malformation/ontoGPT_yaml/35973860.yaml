input_text: 'Long-term outcomes of lymphatic malformations in children: An 11-year
  experience from a tertiary referral center. BACKGROUND: Lymphatic malformations
  (LMs) are benign, congenital lesions that display considerable heterogeneity in
  terms of size, location and characteristics. This study aims to describe the long-term
  outcomes of current management strategies for patients with simple (cystic) LMs.
  METHODS: The case records of all patients (age <=16 years) with simple (cystic)
  LMs at our tertiary institution between 2008 and 2019 were assessed for clinical
  features, imaging and details of management, including complications. RESULTS: Of
  a total of 164 patients (60% male), 66% were diagnosed aged <2 years. The median
  follow-up was 5 (0.3-16) years from diagnosis. LMs were located in the head and
  neck (40%), extremities (27%), trunk (23%), mediastinum (4%), or intra-abdominally
  (6%). Types were macrocystic in 47%, microcystic in 21% and mixed in 32%. Sclerotherapy
  was the most common intervention (38%). Primary surgery had been performed in 12%.
  Symptomatic improvement, reduction in size, or complete regression were observed
  in 82/102 (80%) of LMs after interventions; complications from treatment were uncommon
  (Clavien-Dindo grade I-II: 6%; grade III-IIId: 1%). Sixty-two patients (38%; median
  age 0.5 (range, 0-12) years) had not required interventions to date; spontaneous
  regression of the LM occurred in 16 (26%) of these expectantly followed-up cases.
  CONCLUSIONS: Most studies to date have focused on LMs in selected anatomical locations.
  Herein the outcomes of an entire population from a single tertiary unit of patients
  are presented, demonstrating the wide heterogeneity of simple (cystic) LMs and highlighting
  the importance of individualized, multidisciplinary approaches to care in achieving
  optimal outcomes.'
