input_text: A case of microcystic lymphatic malformation successfully treated with
  topical sirolimus. Microcystic lymphatic malformation (MLM), also known as "lymphangioma
  circumscriptum," is a lymphatic malformation which may involve the skin and subcutaneous
  tissues. Progressive growth of lesions may cause pressure to the surrounding organs.
  Lesions frequently reoccur after treatment with surgery, sclerotherapy, radiotherapy,
  and laser therapy. In the last decades, oral sirolimus has been successfully used
  in lymphatic malformations. Since systemic treatment with sirolimus is associated
  with various side effects, topical form of the drug has been used with satisfying
  results, especially for the angiofibromas. Promisingly, few case studies indicate
  topical sirolimus as a potential treatment for the lymphatic malformations. Here,
  we report an 8-year-old girl with MLM on left trunk whose lesions recurred after
  the surgery that has been performed at 1 year of age. We administered twice daily
  topical sirolimus at 0.75 mg/ml concentration. After 2 weeks, a local irritation
  occurred and the dose was decreased to once daily. The treatment was stopped at
  the end of 3 months as the lesions were almost cleared and the patient did not want
  to continue to therapy. There were no new lesions after 8 months of follow up.
