input_text: 'Malignancy-associated acquired vulvar lymphangioma circumscriptum: A
  clinicopathologic study of 71 cases. BACKGROUND: Acquired lymphangioma circumscriptum
  of the vulva is rare and can occur subsequent to malignancies of the anogenital
  and pelvic region. We sought to investigate the clinicopathologic characteristics
  of malignancy-associated acquired vulvar lymphangioma circumscriptum (AVLC). METHODS:
  We identified all cases of AVLC within our institution with history of prior malignancy
  between 2005 and 2021. A similar search was performed in the PubMed database to
  identify published cases to date. The clinical and histopathologic information was
  recorded. RESULTS: A total of 71 cases were identified. The most common preceding
  malignancy was cervical carcinoma (71.8%, 51/71). Radiation therapy was given to
  91.4% (64/70) of the patients and lymph node dissection was made on 70.2% (40/57).
  Median interval between the diagnosis of malignancy and the AVLC was 10 years (range
  0-32 years). AVLC frequently presented as vesicular (31.6%, 18/57) or verrucous
  (28.1%, 16/57) lesions clinically. Common treatments for AVLC included excision
  (53.1%, 26/49) and laser therapy (16.3%, 8/49), with an overall recurrence rate
  of 42.9% (24/56) at a median follow-up interval of 1.8 years (range 0.04-32.3 years).
  CONCLUSION: AVLC is a rare, late complication of anogenital and pelvic malignancies
  causing debilitating physical symptoms and psychological stress. Further studies
  are warranted to determine the most effective treatment modalities to mitigate recurrence.'
