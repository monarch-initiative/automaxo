input_text: "The Practicality of Preparing Skim Breast Milk at Home for Treatment
  of Infants Requiring Low Fat Diets. Introduction: The benefits of breast milk (BM)
  for infants have long been established. However, for health-compromised infants
  with difficulty processing long-chain triglycerides, BM is often discontinued, and
  skimmed breast milk (SBM) is used as a dietary treatment. SBM is usually produced
  for inpatients in a hospital laboratory. The aim of this study was to determine
  the viability of skimming BM at home. Case Report: A female infant was diagnosed
  with congenital lipomatous asymmetric overgrowth, vascular malformations, epidermal
  nevi, and skeletal and spinal anomalies (CLOVES) syndrome, with symptoms of lymphatic
  malformation, chylothorax, and pleural effusion. The patient's family produced SBM
  at home after discharge; the SBM met the dietary treatment requirements and kept
  symptoms under control. Methods: A nonrefrigerated benchtop centrifuge was used
  to produce SBM at the patient's home. The optimal setting for the centrifuge was
  determined and then used to process BM samples from the infant's mother. The samples
  were randomly selected from each 10-day period over 6 months, and 18 samples were
  processed in total. The hospital laboratory processed the same samples of BM and
  analyzed the macronutrients with a comparison of the home-produced SBM to the hospital-produced
  SBM. Results: The home-produced SBM met the dietary treatment requirement of <1.0
  g/dL of fat content. Fat was significantly lower, proteins were significantly higher,
  and carbohydrates and calories were not significantly different compared to hospital-produced
  SBM. Conclusions: It is viable to consistently produce SBM at home that meets the
  dietary treatment requirements of health-compromised infants."
