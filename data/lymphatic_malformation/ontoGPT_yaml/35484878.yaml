input_text: 'Pharmacokinetics of bleomycin sclerotherapy in patients with vascular
  malformations. Bleomycin, a chemotherapy agent that inhibits synthesis of DNA, has
  been increasingly utilized in sclerotherapy for patients with vascular malformations.
  A serious long-term risk of intravenous bleomycin is dose-dependent interstitial
  pneumonitis. Little is known about absorption and circulating levels of bleomycin
  when used in sclerotherapy for patients with vascular malformations. This is an
  Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved prospective study on patients receiving
  bleomycin sclerotherapy in the management of vascular malformations. Depending on
  the type of vascular malformation, bleomycin was administered either in the lumen
  or interstitial space of the involved lesion. A bleomycin assay measured serum bleomycin
  plasma concentrations versus time at seven intervals following treatment. Pharmacokinetic
  parameters were obtained for each participant and included peak plasma concentration
  (Cmax ), time to reach peak plasma concentration (Tmax ), volume of distribution
  (Vd ), elimination half-life (t1/2 ), the volume of plasma cleared of the drug per
  unit time (CL), and total systemic exposure area under the curve (AUC). Fifteen
  patients were enrolled (5: lymphatic, 4: venous, 6: arteriovenous malformations).
  Bleomycin was administered interstitially (IS) in 11 patients and intraluminal (IL)
  in four; median age of 13 years (range: 2-67). Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed
  terminal elimination half-life (t1/2lambdaz ) of 88.51 (+-23.09) and 111.61 (+-37.75)
  minutes for the IS and IL groups, respectively. Vd was 4.86 L (+-6.74) and 1.55
  L (+-0.54) for the IS and IL groups, respectively. AUC was 53.9 (+-23.45) and 129.17
  (+-93.57) mg min/L for the IS and IL groups, respectively. There were no statistically
  significant differences in t1/2lambdaz , Vd , or AUC parameters between groups.
  Bleomycin is absorbed systemically when used as a sclerosant for vascular malformations
  when injected either IS or IL.'
