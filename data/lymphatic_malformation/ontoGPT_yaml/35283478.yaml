input_text: 'Complex lymphatic malformations in pediatrics: a review of treatment
  options. INTRODUCTION: Lymphatic malformations (LMs) are low-flow lesions resulting
  from abnormalities in the development of lymphatics. The management of these lesions
  is complex and involve the collaboration of many specialties. The purpose of this
  review is to summarize current knowledge regarding the different therapeutic options
  used in complex lymphatic malformations, analyzing their indications, efficacy and
  complications. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A search was made using the algorithm: "(lymphatic
  abnormality OR lymphatic malformation OR lymphangioma OR cystic hygroma) AND (extensive
  OR giant OR complex) AND (therapeutics OR treatment) AND (child OR children)". Of
  the 120 articles found, 53 were included. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Historically, surgery
  was the treatment of choice for this type of lesions. However, excision was often
  incomplete, associated with high rates of recurrence and severe complications. The
  use of sclerotherapy emerged as a minimal invasive option appropriate in selected
  cases as a single or adjuvant therapy. Inhibitors of the mammalian target of rapamycin,
  such as sirolimus, now play a central role in the treatment of complex malformations
  resistant to sclerotherapy, recurrent after surgery or more extensive malformations
  that affect vital structures. Other therapeutic options as sildenafil and laser
  ablation are also recognized as effective in selected cases. CONCLUSIONS: Looking
  through the literature over the last decade authors realize that surgery had gradually
  been replaced by less invasive options such as sirolimus with or without adjuvant
  sclerotherapy. In conclusion, each treatment option seems to have its own indications
  and characteristics, which must be considered in therapeutic decision and individualized
  for each patient.'
