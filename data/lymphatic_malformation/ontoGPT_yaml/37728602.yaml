input_text: 'Targeted therapy and immunotherapy for orbital and periorbital tumors:
  a major review. Traditionally, for patients who are poor candidates for surgery
  and/or radiotherapy, palliative chemotherapy is often offered but with significant
  toxic side effects. However, recent advancements in our understanding of tumor biology
  and molecular genetics have brought new understanding to the molecular pathways
  of certain tumors and cancers. This has ushered in a new era of precision medicine
  specific to a tumor or cancer treatment pathway (targeted therapy) or directed to
  host-tumor responses (immunotherapy). This article will focus on recent updates
  in the application of available targeted and immunotherapy for managing orbital
  and periorbital tumors and tumor-like conditions, which include cutaneous basal
  cell carcinoma, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, cutaneous melanoma, Merkel cell
  carcinoma, sebaceous gland carcinoma, solitary fibrous tumor, dermatofibrosarcoma
  protuberans, orbital meningioma, neurofibromatosis, Langerhans cell histiocytosis,
  ocular adnexal lymphoma, orbital lymphatic malformation, and adenoid cystic carcinoma.'
