input_text: 'Sirolimus is efficacious in treatment for extensive and/or complex slow-flow
  vascular malformations: a monocentric prospective phase II study. BACKGROUND: Extensive
  and complex vascular malformations often cause chronic pain and severe functional
  restraint. Conventional treatments, such as surgery and/or sclerotherapy, are rarely
  curative, underscoring the great need for new therapeutic modalities. Recent preclinical
  and clinical data demonstrated that sirolimus could offset the progression of vascular
  malformations and significantly improve quality of life of patients through inhibition
  of the Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR)
  pathway. The purpose of this prospective study was to assess the efficacy and safety
  of this treatment in patients with extensive or complex slow-flow vascular malformations.
  METHODS: Sirolimus was administered orally on a continuous dosing schedule with
  pharmacokinetic-guided target serum concentration level of 10 to 15 ng/ml. Patients
  were seen every month for the first three months and subsequently every three months.
  The primary endpoints were safety and efficacy, based on clinical, biological and
  radiological evaluations, as well as a quality of life questionnaire. RESULTS: Nineteen
  patients, from 3 to 64 years old, with lymphatic (LM), venous (VM) or complex slow-flow
  malformations, refractory to standard care, were enrolled and received sirolimus
  continuously. After 12 months of follow-up, 16 patients were available for assessment
  of efficacy and safety: all had a significant and rapid improvement of their symptoms
  and quality of life. In two patients, sirolimus treatment permitted sclerotherapy
  and surgery, initially evaluated unfeasible. Sirolimus was well tolerated, with
  mucositis as the most common (10% of patients) grade 3 adverse event. CONCLUSIONS:
  Sirolimus was efficient in extensive LM, VM and/or complex malformations that were
  refractory to conventional treatments and was well tolerated.'
