input_text: '[Lymphangioma of the scrotum]. INTRODUCTION: Lymphangioma (lymphatic
  malformation) is a congenital malformation of lymphatic vessels. According to the
  classification of the International Society for the Study of the Vascular Anomalies,
  there are macrocystic, microcystic and mixed types of lymphatic malformations. The
  typical location of the lymphangiomas is the area of large lymphatic collectors
  (head, neck, axillary areas), while the scrotum is not frequently affected. AIM:
  To present a rare clinical case of lymphatic malformation of the scrotum with successful
  minimally invasive treatment (sclerotherapy). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A clinical
  observation of a 12-year-old child with a diagnosis of "Lymphatic malformation of
  the scrotum" is presented. From the age of 4, there was a large lesion in the left
  half of the scrotum. In other clinic, a surgical removal with a diagnosis of "left-sided
  inguinal hernia", "spermatic cord hydrocele", "isolated left-sided hydrocele" was
  performed. However, there was a recurrence after the procedure. When contacting
  the Clinic of pediatrics and pediatric surgery, scrotal lymphangioma was suspected.
  The diagnosis was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging. The patient underwent
  minimally invasive sclerotherapy using the drug "Haemoblock". After 6 months of
  follow-up, no relapse was seen. CONCLUSION: Lymphangioma (lymphatic malformation)
  of the scrotum is a rare urological pathology that requires specific diagnosis,
  in-depth differential diagnosis and treatment by a multidisciplinary team of doctors,
  including a specialist in the treatment of vascular pathology.'
