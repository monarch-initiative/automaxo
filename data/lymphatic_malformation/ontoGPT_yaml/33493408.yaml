input_text: Lymphatic and Mixed Malformations. Lymphatic and mixed malformations are
  rare and variable in presentation. They arise due to errors in vascular and lymphatic
  formation during early embryonic development. This leads to persistent infiltration
  of lymph fluid into soft tissues and causes a locally invasive mass with pathologic
  sequelae. Departing from historically descriptive terminology, such as "cystic hygroma,"
  lymphatic malformations are now categorized as macrocystic, microcystic, or mixed
  lesions, based on size. Advances in imaging modalities, such as ultrasonography
  and magnetic resonance imaging, have made accurate characterization of these lesions
  possible and ultimately allow for early diagnosis and implementation of appropriate
  treatment based on the morphology of the lymphatic malformation. Management of lymphatic
  malformations can be quite challenging, and a multidisciplinary approach is most
  effective for optimum aesthetic and functional outcomes. New discoveries in the
  molecular biology of lymphatic malformations have provided treatment targets and
  established a role for pharmacotherapy. Sclerotherapy, laser, and radiofrequency
  ablation have all proven to be effective as minimally invasive treatment options
  for lymphatic malformations. Surgical intervention has a role in the treatment of
  focal lesions recalcitrant to these less invasive techniques. Operative planning
  is dictated by clinical goals, size, anatomic location, characteristics, and extent
  of infiltration.
