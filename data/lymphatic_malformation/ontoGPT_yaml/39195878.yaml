input_text: A case report of sirolimus use in early fetal management of lymphatic
  malformation. Sirolimus, by targeting the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway,
  has demonstrated efficacy on lymphatic malformations (LMs) in adults and neonates.
  The current hypothesis is that the earlier the lesion is treated, the better it
  responds. This has prompted the idea that sirolimus administration might be efficacious
  to treat fetal LMs as well. Here we report a successful management of a cervicofacial
  fetal LM with sirolimus taken orally by the mother from the 22nd week of pregnancy
  until 2 weeks before planned delivery. Repeated cordocentesis recorded a 30% transplacental
  crossing of sirolimus. Continuation of sirolimus after birth allowed resection of
  the residual mass. We have followed the physical and neurological evolution of the
  child for 6 years since the fetal administration of sirolimus. We conclude that
  early administration of sirolimus during pregnancy with maternal serum monitoring
  may be proposed to high-risk fetal LMs in selected cases.
