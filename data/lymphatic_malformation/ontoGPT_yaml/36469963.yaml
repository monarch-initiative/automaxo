input_text: "Sirolimus-induced pulmonary hemorrhage of an infant with massive cervicofacial
  lymphatic malformation: A case report. Lymphatic malformations (LMs) are uncommon
  congenital abnormalities of the lymphatic system. As more than half of these lesions
  develop in the head and neck, LMs can be life-threatening if associated with airway
  involvement. LMs necessitate a multidisciplinary treatment approach, frequently
  including surgery and sclerotherapy. We present a case report of a 32-week pre-term
  male infant with a massive cervicofacial LM necessitating delivery via ex-utero
  intrapartum treatment (EXIT). The patient was treated with numerous rounds of sclerotherapy,
  systemic sirolimus, and surgical debulking, but ultimately died at 4 months of age
  due to acute pulmonary hemorrhage, which may have been related to sirolimus due
  to the absence of any other associable organ involvement or derangement. We document
  the patient's clinical course and treatment regimen, highlighting the myriad modalities
  employed to treat these challenging lesions, and describe a potentially lethal complication
  of sirolimus therapy not previously described in the treatment of pediatric LM."
