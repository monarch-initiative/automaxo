input_text: 'Utilizing immediate preoperative n-BCA in the resection of head and neck
  venous and lymphatic malformations. PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE: To add to the current literature
  on single stage excision of head and neck vascular malformations with preoperative
  n-butyl cyanoacrylate (n-BCA) glue. Unlike previous studies, this series includes
  pediatric and adult patients, highlights a single stage partial excision of a complex
  venous malformation, and describes the first description of using glue prior to
  resection of a macrocystic lymphatic malformation. STUDY DESIGN: Case series with
  chart review. SETTING: Tertiary-care adult and pediatric hospital. SUBJECTS AND
  RESULTS: Four patients (3 males - 9, 13, 25 years, 1 female - 61 years) underwent
  same day excision of head and neck vascular malformations utilizing immediate preoperative
  n-BCA glue embolization performed by interventional radiology and otolaryngology,
  as described by Tieu et al. The indications for resection included bleeding (1/4),
  pain (3/4), cosmetic deformity (3/4), and discomfort with denture wear (1/4). Prior
  interventions included none (1/4), cautery and primary closure to control acute
  hemorrhage (1/4), and sclerotherapy (2/4). Treatments included complete embolization
  and resection of simple venous malformation (VM)s of the oral cavity/lip (2/4),
  partial embolization and resection of a complex hemifacial venous malformation (VM)
  (1/4), and complete embolization and resection of a lymphatic malformation (LM)
  (1/4). On average, 97 min of anesthesia time was added for the preoperative embolization
  procedure (range, 94-104 min). All patients had a successful embolization without
  need for coils. Operative time ranged from 28 to 44 min for the simple cases and
  was 6 h and 30 min for the complex case. There was minimal blood loss in all cases.
  There were no associated complications, lesion recurrences, or long-term deficits
  at an average follow-up of 5 months. The patient with the complex hemifacial VM
  demonstrated subtle lower facial weakness post-operatively, which completely resolved
  within two months. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of head and neck vascular malformations
  with preoperative n-BCA glue and subsequent surgical excision is a viable method
  for both simple and complex lesions. The safety and efficacy of this technique has
  been demonstrated in the past in a limited number of studies. This study further
  supports the use of this technique to address patient concerns such as pain or discomfort
  and cosmetic deformity, even if the lesion is only partially resectable. In our
  series a lymphatic malformation refractory to sclerotherapy was treated with a similar
  technique of glue and resection, following aspiration of the mucoid LM fluid. Our
  series emphasizes that pediatric vascular malformations carry functional and cosmetic
  deficits into adulthood that can and should be addressed in this patient population.
  Therefore, same-day embolization and resection should be coordinated when possible,
  in order to optimize patient safety and convenience.'
