input_text: 'Topical sirolimus 0.1% for treating cutaneous microcystic lymphatic malformations
  in children and adults (TOPICAL): protocol for a multicenter phase 2, within-person,
  randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled clinical trial. BACKGROUND: Cutaneous
  microcystic lymphatic malformations (CMLMs) are rare conditions in children and
  adults. They present as clusters of vesicles full of lymph and blood to various
  extents, inducing maceration, esthetic impairment, pain, and impaired quality of
  life. The treatment is challenging. Sirolimus is an inhibitor of mammalian target
  of rapamycin (mTOR) involved in angio-lymphangiogenesis. Topical sirolimus has recently
  been reported as effective in a few reports of patients with CMLMs. The objective
  is to compare the efficacy and safety of a 12-week application of 0.1% topical sirolimus
  versus topical vehicle in CMLMs in children and adults. METHODS: This French blinded
  multicenter within-person randomized controlled phase 2 trial aims to include 55
  patients aged >= 6 years who have a primary CMLM. The CMLM will be divided into
  two equal areas that will be randomly allocated to 0.1% topical sirolimus or topical
  vehicle applied for 12 weeks. At the end of the 12-week period, the patient/parent
  will treat the whole area of CMLM with 0.1% topical sirolimus on remaining lesions,
  for eight more weeks. Patients will be seen at week 20 (treatment will be stopped)
  and at month 12 to evaluate long-term efficacy. The primary outcome will be improvement
  of the CMLM in the area treated with topical sirolimus compared to the area treated
  with topical vehicle by the investigator physician (blinded to the treatment) with
  the Physician Global Assessment score at week 12. Secondary outcomes will include:
  assessment of efficacy by independent experts on the basis of standardized photographs;
  impact on quality of life; efficacy for oozing, bleeding, erythema, and thickness
  evaluated by the investigators; and global efficacy as well as efficacy for functional
  and aesthetic impairment evaluated by the patient. Systemic passage of sirolimus
  will be measured at weeks 6, 12, and 20, and at week 16 for CMLMs >= 900 cm2. DISCUSSION:
  For patients with CMLMs, topical sirolimus could be a non-invasive and well-tolerated
  therapeutic option. If the trial demonstrates efficacy and safety of this treatment,
  this result will lead to a real change in the management of this condition, and
  0.1% sirolimus cream would become the first-line treatment. TRIAL REGISTRATION:
