input_text: "Safety and efficacy of surgery combined with bleomycin irrigation for
  complex cervical-facial lymphatic malformations of children. BACKGROUND: In this
  retrospective study, we compare the safety and efficacy of surgery combined with
  bleomycin intra-operatively with intralesional sclerotherapy alone for the management
  of head and neck lymphatic malformations in children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The
  patients with cervical-facial lymphatic malformations were reviewed in Shanghai
  Children's Hospital from August 2014 to August 2018. Data analysis was performed
  using SPSS17.0. Pearson X2 test and t-test were used, and the significance level
  was fixed at 5%. RESULTS: 72 patients in all of which 63 patients underwent surgical
  excision combined with bleomycin irrigation and 9 patients underwent sclerotherapy
  alone as the primary treatment. The surgical excision group had a significantly
  higher rate of an excellent response compare to the sclerotherapy group (P < 0.05).
  In regards to postoperative complications, the surgical group had no higher rate
  of temporal facial paralysis and other nerve injures compare to the sclerotherapy
  group (P = 0.624). CONCLUSIONS: we recommend surgery combined with Bleomycin for
  microcystic disease with focal and less infiltrative lesions and for lesions located
  in the oropharynx, parapharynx, retropharynx, or hypopharynx."
