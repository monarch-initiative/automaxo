input_text: 'Management of Macrocystic Lymphatic Malformation in the Cervicofacial
  Region: Ultrasound-Guided Iodine Tincture Cauterization Combined With Intralesional
  Negative Pressure. PURPOSE: The purpose of our study was to evaluate the efficacy
  and safety of ultrasound-guided iodine tincture cauterization combined with postoperative
  intralesional negative pressure in the management of cervicofacial cystic lymphatic
  malformation (cLM). METHOD: From January 2019 to July 2021, indocyanine green lymphography
  was performed preoperatively to confirm the lymph inflow, and this treatment was
  administered in 71 patients with cervicofacial cLM in our center. All cases were
  evaluated by curative effects, treatment frequency, and adverse events. The duration
  of posttreatment follow-up was from 12 to 14 months. RESULTS: Indocyanine green
  lymphography indicated at least one lymphatic inflow in each cLM lesion. Excellent
  resolution was observed in 87.3% of cases, and good improvement of the treated cLM
  occurred in 9.9% of cases, and 2 cases with fair outcomes required subsequent treatment.
  It is noteworthy that no case was treated more than 3 times. Some minor adverse
  effects, including localized itch and scar, were managed by symptomatic treatment.
  CONCLUSIONS: Because of satisfactory outcomes and low treatment frequency, ultrasound-guided
  iodine tincture cauterization combined with intralesional negative pressure represents
  an efficacious, safe, and feasible method for the management of macro-cLM in the
  cervicofacial region.'
