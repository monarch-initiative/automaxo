input_text: 'Use of topical rapamycin in the treatment of superficial lymphatic malformations.
  BACKGROUND: The superficial lymphatic component of vascular malformations poses
  a significant treatment challenge. It is responsible for the majority of symptoms
  presented, and to date, there is no consensus regarding treatment. OBJECTIVE: To
  evaluate the effectiveness of topical rapamycin in treating superficial lymphatic
  malformations (LM). METHODS: A case series study was performed of patients with
  superficial LM, treated with topical rapamycin. The clinical characteristics of
  patients and the concentration and application mode of the drug were recorded. The
  changes in the signs and symptoms observed and associated adverse effects were noted
  and analyzed. RESULTS: The study population consisted of 11 patients of an average
  age of 10.5 years. All were treated with topical rapamycin: 6 patients with a 1%
  concentration, 1 with a 0.8% concentration, and 4 with a 0.4% concentration. Changes
  in the clinical appearance of the lesions were observed in all patients. The associated
  symptoms, present in 9 of 11 patients, improved in every case. The mean follow-up
  time was 16.1 months. LIMITATIONS: This study is retrospective, with a small sample
  size and considerable heterogeneity of lesions and treatment approaches. CONCLUSION:
  Treatment with topical rapamycin modifies the clinical appearance and alleviates
  symptoms of superficial LM.'
