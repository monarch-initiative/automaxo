input_text: 'Indications for tracheostomy in children with head and neck lymphatic
  malformation: analysis of a nationwide survey in Japan. PURPOSE: Airway obstruction
  caused by lymphatic malformation (LM) in the head and neck may require a tracheostomy.
  We present the results of our analysis of a nationwide survey on the indications
  for tracheostomy in children with head and neck LM. METHODS: We analyzed data in
  relation to tracheostomy based on a questionnaire about 518 children with head and
  neck LM without mediastinal involvement. RESULTS: Tracheostomy was performed for
  43 of the 518 children. Most (32/43) of these children were younger than 1 year
  of age and the tracheostomy was almost always performed for airway obstruction (40/43).
  The lesion was in contact with the airway in 32 (72%) of these children, but in
  only 58 (12%) of the 473 children who were managed without tracheostomy. When the
  maximum circumferential area of contact was compared, only 20 (27%) of 74 patients
  with maximum contact of less than a half-circle required tracheostomy, whereas 11
  of 13 with maximum contact of more than a half-circle required tracheostomy (P =
  0.0001). Six patients without airway contact required tracheostomy because of acute
  swelling caused by hemorrhage, infection, or both. CONCLUSIONS: Children with head
  and neck LM required tracheostomy to relieve airway obstruction. Tracheostomy should
  be considered if the lesion is in contact with the airway and surrounds more than
  a half-circle, and when it causes acute swelling.'
