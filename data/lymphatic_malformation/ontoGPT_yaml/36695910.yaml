input_text: "Association between malformation type, location and functional deficits
  in lymphatic malformations of the head and neck in children. PURPOSE: Lymphatic
  malformations (LM) are congenital malformations of the lymphatic system, mainly
  located in the head and neck area. They can be staged based on location according
  to de Serres and based on different morbidity items using the Cologne Disease Score
  (CDS), a clinical staging system. In many cases, functional impairment greatly affects
  the life of patients suffering from lymphatic malformations. The present study aims
  to analyze a cohort of pediatric patients with LM. METHODS: A retrospective analysis
  of 144 pediatric patients with head and neck LM was performed. Location, type of
  malformation (microcystic, macrocystic, mixed), scoring according to two different
  scoring systems and therapy were analyzed. Kruskal-Wallis test was used to analyze
  the difference in CDS between the patient groups and Dunn's test was used for post-hoc
  pairwise comparison. RESULTS: The average age at presentation was 6.1 years. The
  most common sites were neck (47%), cheek/parotid gland (26%), tongue (17%) and orbit
  (8%). Macrocystic malformations dominated the lateral neck, while microcystic malformations
  were predominantly localized in the tongue and floor of mouth. Macrocystic malformations
  (mean CDS 9.44) were associated with significantly better CDS than microcystic (mean
  CDS 7.11) and mixed (mean CDS 5.71) malformations (p < 0.001). LM in stage V according
  to de Serres had the lowest values (mean CDS: 4.26). The most common therapeutic
  procedures were conventional surgical (partial) resection, laser therapy and sclerotherapy
  with OK-432. CONCLUSIONS: There is an association between malformation type, location
  according to de Serres and CDS in children with LM of the head and neck. Patients
  with microcystic and mixed malformations in stage V had lowest CDS levels."
