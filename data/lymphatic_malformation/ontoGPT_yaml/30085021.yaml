input_text: 'Early Identification of Primary Hypothyroidism in Neonates Exposed to
  Intralymphatic Iodinated Contrast: A Case Series. Context: In neonates, iatrogenic
  hypothyroidism can result from topical or IV iodine exposure. Data on intralymphatic
  iodine exposure, risk factors for disease severity, and timing of hypothyroidism
  are limited. Case Descriptions: We report 4 cases of premature neonates with previously
  normal thyroid function tests (TFTs) who developed hypothyroidism after intralymphatic
  iodinated contrast. Patients 1 and 2, premature infants with complex medical histories,
  had chylous effusions and high-volume chest tube output requiring imaging with lymphangiograms
  on day of life (DOL) 97 and DOL 43, respectively. They developed severe, primary
  hypothyroidism with TSH of 335.7 mIU/mL (reference range, 1.7 to 9.1) on DOL 111
  and TSH of 470.2 mIU/mL (reference range, 1.7 to 9.1) on DOL 68. Patient 3 had prenatally
  diagnosed fetal hydrops manifesting with chylous effusions and high-volume chest
  tube output. The infant underwent lymphangiography on DOL 90 and was noted to have
  an elevated TSH of 13.35 mIU/mL (reference range, 1.7 to 9.1) 4 days later with
  spot urine iodine of 1742 microg/L (normal, <200). Patient 4 had a lymphatic malformation
  and underwent sclerotherapy with doxycycline with intralymphatic iodine exposure
  on DOL 4 and was found to have a TSH of 16.7 microU/mL (reference range, 1.7 to
  9.1) 3 days later with spot urine iodine of 228,712 microg/L (normal, <200). The
  TFT results for all patients improved after levothyroxine administration. Conclusion:
  Intralymphatic iodine should be considered a major risk factor in the development
  of iatrogenic primary hypothyroidism, especially in premature neonates soon after
  exposure. Close monitoring of TFTs is imperative to avoid potential long-term adverse
  outcomes in this population.'
