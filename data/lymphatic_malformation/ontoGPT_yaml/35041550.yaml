input_text: 'Successful Sclerotherapy for Cervicofacial Macrocystic Lymphatic Malformations
  Using Polidocanol and Pingyangmycin Combined Foam Sclerosants. Background: Sclerotherapy
  is the first-line therapeutic method for lymphatic malformations (LMs). This retrospective
  cohort study evaluated the effectiveness and safety of a novel combined foam sclerosant:
  polidocanol and pingyangmycin foam (PPF), for treating cervicofacial macrocystic
  LMs. Methods and Results: From July 2018 to October 2020, 51 patients with cervicofacial
  macrocystic LMs were enrolled in this study. All patients received intralesional
  3% polidocanol or PPF injections. The outcome was evaluated regarding demographic
  and clinical characteristics, degree of treatment response, and post-treatment complications.
  Overall, 16 patients (31.4%) underwent PPF sclerotherapy. All these patients (100%)
  showed remarkable reduction in lesion size within three sessions. Excellent responses
  were shown in 88.5% of these patients within three sessions, which is higher than
  single polidocanol sclerotherapy (80%). The average sessions (duration) of PPF sclerotherapy
  were 2.5, which was significantly shorter than the single foam sclerotherapy (p
  < 0.05). Treatment duration was significantly associated with age, lesion location,
  lesion size, and number of cysts (p < 0.05). No severe complications were noted
  in this study. Local or systemic complications, such as swelling and mild fever
  occurred but subsided without any specific treatment. Conclusions: PPF is a safe,
  and effective combined foam sclerosant for the treatment of cervicofacial macrocystic
  LMs. This combined foam can improve treatment response and reduce treatment duration
  compared with a single sclerosant. It can be broadly used if further large-scale
  clinical trials verify its efficacy and safety.'
