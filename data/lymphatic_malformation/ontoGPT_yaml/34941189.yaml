input_text: 'Effect of Japanese Kampo medicine, eppikajutsuto, in patients with lymphatic
  malformation: A retrospective observational study. ABSTRACT: Lymphatic malformations
  (LMs) are congenital malformations of the lymphatic system that cause considerable
  cosmetic and functional complications. In this study, we present 8 children with
  LM who were treated with the Kampo medicine eppikajutsuto (EKJT).Between 2001 and
  2020, 8 children (male: 4, female: 4) with LMs who underwent magnetic resonance
  imaging (MRI) evaluation both before and after treatment or observation were selected
  for investigating the effect of EKJT. Two patients were observed without any treatment
  for 24 and 60 months. EKJT was evaluated based on percentage reduction, defined
  as the percentage of total lesions that decreased in size, confirmed by radiological
  examination after initiating treatment with EKJT or determined by observation alone.
  Volumetric analysis of LMs on MRI was performed using the Digital Imaging and Communications
  in Medicine viewer.Six patients were treated with EKJT. The mean observational period
  was 13.2 months (range: 6-24 months). The mean reduction in LM volume on MRI was
  73.0% in treated patients and -66.3% in observed patients. Two of the 6 lesions
  exhibited complete reduction, 2 exhibited marked (>90%) reduction, 1 exhibited moderate
  reduction, and 1 exhibited a small response. The treatment was well-tolerated, with
  no severe adverse events.This preliminary study demonstrated the beneficial effects
  of EKJT. Prospective evaluations of this promising therapeutic modality are warranted
  based on the results of this study.'
