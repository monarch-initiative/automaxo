input_text: 'New onset dysphagia and pulmonary aspiration following sclerotherapy
  for a complex cervical venolymphatic malformation in an infant: Case report and
  review of the literature. We present the case of a 2-year-old male with a complex
  left cervical venolymphatic malformation who underwent doxycycline sclerotherapy
  at 12 months of age complicated by new onset pulmonary aspiration. A review of the
  literature reveals this to be a rare complication of sclerotherapy and only the
  second reported case. METHODS: Procedural details with associated imaging including
  endoscopic airway and swallowing evaluation are included. A literature review of
  cervical and laryngeal sclerotherapy complications was performed and discussed.
  RESULTS: A 12-month-old male underwent sclerotherapy with doxycycline for a complex
  parapharyngeal and paralaryngeal venolymphatic malformation. The postoperative course
  was complicated by new onset dysphagia, aspiration, and decreased laryngeal sensation.
  Gastric feeding and swallowing therapy were necessary due to prolonged difficulty.
  The sclerotherapy treatment resulted in near elimination of the cervical components
  of the lesion at 12 months follow up. The child progressed to total oral feeding
  by 17 months post-treatment with no evidence of decreased laryngeal sensation. An
  extensive literature review identified only one reported case of new onset dysphagia
  and decreased laryngeal sensation after doxycycline sclerotherapy. CONCLUSIONS:
  Doxycycline sclerotherapy for cervical venolymphatic malformations rarely can cause
  adjacent neural injury resulting in laryngeal complications. Our case report and
  literature review suggest that symptom management and appropriate aspiration precautions
  are necessary in infants or children with presumed vagus or laryngeal nerve injury,
  and injury is likely only temporary.'
