input_text: 'Severe adverse events during sirolimus "off-label" therapy for vascular
  anomalies. OBJECTIVES: Clinical studies have shown low toxicity and a favorable
  safety profile for sirolimus in vascular anomalies. Here, we describe severe adverse
  events (SAEs) observed during "off-label use" for vascular anomalies. METHODS: We
  performed a retrospective, multicenter chart review for SAEs during "off-label"
  sirolimus therapy for vascular anomalies and analyzed these cases by a predesigned
  workflow. RESULTS: We identified 17 SAEs in 14 patients diagnosed with generalized
  lymphatic anomaly (n = 4), Gorham-Stout disease (n = 2), central conducting lymphatic
  anomaly (n = 1), lymphatic malformation (n = 4), tufted angioma (n = 1), kaposiform
  hemangioendothelioma (n = 1), and venous malformation in a patient with CLOVES syndrome
  (n = 1). Three patients presented two SAEs each. The age at initiation of sirolimus
  therapy was under 2 years (n = 5), 2-6 years (n = 5), and older than 12 years (n
  = 4). SAEs occurred during the first 3 months of sirolimus therapy (n = 7), between
  3 and 12 months (n = 7) and after 1 year of therapy (n = 3). The most frequent SAE
  was viral pneumonia (n = 8) resulting in one death due to a metapneumovirus infection
  in a 3 months old and a generalized adenovirus infection in a 28-month-old child.
  Sirolimus blood level at the time of SAEs ranged between 2.7 and 21 ng/L. Five patients
  were on antibiotic prophylaxis. CONCLUSIONS: Most SAEs are observed in the first
  year of sirolimus therapy; however, SAEs can also occur after a longer treatment
  period. SAEs are potentially life threatening, especially in early infancy. Presence
  of other risk factors, that is, underlying vascular anomaly or immune status, may
  contribute to the risk of SAEs. Sirolimus is an important therapeutic option for
  vascular anomalies, but patients and physicians need to be aware that adequate monitoring
  is necessary, especially in patients with complex lymphatic anomalies that are overrepresented
  in our cohort of SAEs.'
