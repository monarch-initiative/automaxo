input_text: "Comparison of different therapeutic approaches for children with common
  lymphatic malformation. BACKGROUND: Our study compared the outcomes of three different
  therapies: surgery (Group I), bleomycin sclerotherapy (Group II), and a combination
  of both (Group III), for children with common (cystic) lymphatic malformation (LM)
  at a paediatric surgical centre in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. METHODS: Medical records
  of patients who were treated for LM in the Paediatric Surgical Centre Universitas
  Gadjah Mada from January 2015 to January 2019 were reviewed. Scoring systems were
  used to assess the outcomes, including reduction of size, problems of aesthetics,
  functional problems, complications, necessity of further interventions, and interventions'
  frequencies. RESULTS: During the four-year study, we included 31 children, consisting
  of 6, 5, and 20 patients in Groups I, II, and III, respectively. The total score
  did not significantly differ between Groups I, II, and III (14.67+-2.80 vs. 13.40+-2.07
  vs. 12.50+-1.47, respectively; p=0.056). Group II scored better in aesthetic problems
  than other groups (p=0.001), Group III scored higher in necessity of further interventions
  compared to the other groups (p=0.026), and Group I was higher in interventions'
  frequencies than the other groups (p<0.001). However, there were no significant
  differences in reduction of size, functional problems, and complications among groups
  (p=0.554, 0.151, and 0.076, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: There is no significant
  different effect of the three modalities treatment for LM, although one group might
  have more beneficial effects compared with the other groups due to different scoring
  system parameters. Further multicentre and prospective cohort studies with a larger
  number of patients are necessary to establish the existence and extent of our findings."
