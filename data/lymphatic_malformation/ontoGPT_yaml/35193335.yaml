input_text: "[Application of surgery combined with bleomycin irrigation for complex
  cervical-facial lymphatic malformations in children]. Objective:To present experience
  and evaluate the safety and efficacy of surgery combined with bleomycin irrigation
  for the management of head and neck lymphatic malformations in children. Methods:The
  medical records of all patients with cervical-facial lymphatic malformations who
  presented to Shanghai Children's Hospital from August 2014 to December 2020 were
  reviewed. 97 children were divided into surgery group(81 cases) and sclerotherapy
  group(16 cases). Conventional contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging(MRI)
  and B-ultrasound examinations were performed both preoperatively and postoperatively.
  The surgical group received lymphangioma resection combined with bleomycin irrigation.
  The sclerotherapy group was treated with B-ultrasound-guided percutaneous lymphangioma
  aspiration and bleomycin sclerotherapy. SPSS 21.0 software was used to evaluate
  the clinical cure rate and postoperative complications of lesions in both groups
  by chi-square test. Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate the disease-free survival
  rate and draw survival curve. Results:In the surgery group of 81 children, 64 cases
  were cured and 17 cases were effective while in the sclerosis group, 8 cases were
  cured and 8 cases were effective. Cox proportional risk model found that children
  in the surgery group had a higher cure rate and a lower risk of 5-year recurrence
  than those in the sclerotherapy group, with statistically significant differences(chi2=5.814,
  P<0.05). The risk of recurrence in the surgery group was 35.4% of that in the sclerotherapy
  group(HR=0.354, P<0.05). In regards to postoperative complications, the surgical
  group had no higher rate of temporal facial paralysis and other nerve injuries compared
  to the sclerotherapy group(chi2=1.041, P=0.308). Conclusion:Surgery combined with
  bleomycin irrigation in the complex cervical-facial lymphatic malformations was
  confirmed to be effectively and safely. The principle of the surgery was to protect
  the structure and function of normal tissue while excising the lesions as much as
  possible. When the lesions involved the posterior two-thirds of the tongue, the
  floor of the mouth, parapharynx, retropharynx, or hypopharynx spaces. Radiofrequency
  ablation was used in the surgical excision, which made the surgery more minimally
  invasive, accurate and personalized."
