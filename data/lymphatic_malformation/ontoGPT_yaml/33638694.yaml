input_text: Intranodal lymphangiography and interstitial lymphatic embolization to
  treat chyluria caused by a lymphatic malformation in a pediatric patient. Chyluria
  is characterized by chyle in the urinary tract and often presents as milky-white
  urine. We present a case of chyluria from a lymphatic malformation in a 13-year-old
  boy diagnosed using dynamic intranodal contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR)
  lymphangiography. This report demonstrates the utility of intranodal lymphangiography
  and interstitial lymphatic embolization to treat a pediatric patient presenting
  with persistent chyluria. Glue migration into the urinary collecting system is a
  potential complication of this procedure that can be mitigated by adjusting the
  n-butyl cyanoacrylate dilution with Lipiodol.
