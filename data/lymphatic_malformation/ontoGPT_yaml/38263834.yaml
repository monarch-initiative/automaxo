input_text: 'Sclerotherapy with intralesional bleomycin injection under guidance of
  multi-slice CT for retrobulbar orbital low-flow vascular lesions-single-center experience.
  OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the safety and efficacy of sclerotherapy with
  intralesional bleomycin injection (IBI) for retrobulbar orbital low-flow vascular
  lesions under multi-slice computed tomography (CT) guidance. METHODS: Between January
  2010 and September 2021, consecutive patients with retrobulbar orbital low-flow
  vascular lesions who underwent CT-guided IBI at a tertiary centre in Taiwan were
  enrolled. Their medical records and imaging data were retrospectively collected.
  RESULTS: This study enrolled 13 patients (7 male and 6 female patients; age range:
  1-57 years; mean age: 25.9 years) with lymphatic malformation (LM, n = 4), venolymphatic
  malformation (n = 1), and venous malformation (VM, n = 8). The overall radiological
  response rate was 76.9% (10 of 13); the radiological response rate was 75.0% in
  the VM group (6 of 8) and 75.0% in the LM group (3 of 4). Moreover, 3 patients (23.1%)
  had minor complications and 1 (7.7%) had a major complication. The mean clinical
  and radiological follow-up was 8.3 months and no recurrence or progression was reported.
  CONCLUSION: CT-guided IBI is an effective and relatively safe minimally invasive
  treatment for retrobulbar orbital low-flow vascular lesions, with an overall radiological
  response rate of 76.9% in a mean of 1.5 sessions and a low complication rate. ADVANCES
  IN KNOWLEDGE: CT-guided sclerotherapy with IBI is a relatively safe, effective,
  and feasible alternative treatment option for retrobulbar orbital low-flow vascular
  lesions.'
