input_text: "Doxycycline Sclerotherapy of Head and Neck Lymphatic Malformations: Intermediate
  Report of 27 Cases. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of percutaneous
  doxycycline sclerotherapy of head and neck lymphatic malformations (LM) with a 40-month
  follow-up of 27 cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-seven consecutive patients
  with head and neck LM who underwent doxycycline sclerotherapy from 2010 to 2019
  were retrospectively reviewed. Pre- and peri-interventional data collection included
  patients' demographics, clinical and radiological presentation, number of treatment
  procedures, amount of doxycycline used for each session of sclerotherapy. Postinterventional
  clinical outcome data were assessed based on the electronic, medical reports with
  special attention to clinical improvement, measurement of the lesion on ultrasound
  and magnetic resonance imaging after the last session of sclerotherapy and complications
  of sclerotherapy. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients underwent a mean of four doxycycline
  sclerotherapy sessions (range 1-23). The mean total dose of injected doxycycline
  per session was 170 mg. Maximal diameter of the LM decreased from mean 59.7 mm (median
  58 mm; 25-130 mm) before treatment to mean of 29.6 mm (median 30 mm; 0 mm 64 mm)
  after the last session (P < 0.0001). Over a mean follow-up period of 40 months,
  complete or incomplete disappearance of symptoms was found in 23 (85%) and 3 (11%)
  of patients, respectively. In one patient, sclerotherapy did not result in better
  clinical outcome. Two out of 27 patients presented with minor post-procedural complications,
  and one patient with a post-procedural intralesional bleeding considered as a major
  complication. CONCLUSION: Ultrasound-guided, percutaneous doxycycline sclerotherapy
  is a safe and effective method of managing symptomatic LM of the head and neck."
