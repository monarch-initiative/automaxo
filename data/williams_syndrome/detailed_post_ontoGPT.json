Four examples of use of PCCC data to evaluate variability in morphology, management, and outcomes for the procedures are described. Consideration is given to the following clinical problems: (1) the experience with surgical heart block in operative closure of perimembranous VSD, (2) the transition away from atrial baffle operations to the arterial switch operation for simple transposition of the great arteries, (3) the experience of planned 3 stage palliation of hypoplastic left heart syndrome, and (4) the identification of a high risk combination of cardiovascular anomalies in Williams syndrome. Analysis of registry outcomes allows ongoing quality improvement at a cardiac center to consider not only its own experience but that of the overall group. The PCCC data can be used to personalize management of rare congenital cardiac anomalies and combinations of anomalies. The PCCC registry allows longitudinal consideration of issues such as staged repairs and incidence of unplanned reoperation. In future years, the PCCC can facilitate investigations into the etiology of congenital heart disease.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: As modern medicine is advancing, younger, small, and more complex children are becoming multi-organ transplant candidates. This brings up new challenges in all aspects of their care. METHODS: We describe the first report of a small child receiving a simultaneous liver and kidney transplant and abdominal rectus sheath fascia transplant on the background of Williams syndrome and methylmalonic acidaemia. At the time of transplantation, the child was 3 years old, weighed 14.0 kg, had chronic kidney disease stage V, and had not yet started any other form of kidney replacement therapy. RESULTS: There were many anaesthetic, medical, metabolic, and surgical challenges to consider in this case. A long general anaesthetic time increased the risk of cardiac complications and metabolic decompensation. Additionally, the small size of the patient and the organ size mis-match meant that primary abdominal closure was not possible. The patient's recovery was further complicated by sepsis, transient CNI toxicity, and de novo DSAs. CONCLUSIONS: Through a multidisciplinary approach between 9 specialties in 4 hospitals across England and Wales, and detailed pre-operative planning, a good outcome was achieved for this child. An hour by hour management protocol was drafted to facilitate transplant and included five domains: 1. management at the time of organ offer; 2. before the admission; 3. at admission and before theatre time; 4. intra-operative management; and 5. post-operative management in the first 24 h. Importantly, gaining a clear and in depth understanding of the metabolic state of the patient pre- and peri-operatively was crucial in avoiding metabolic decompensation. Furthermore, an abdominal rectus sheath fascia transplant was required to achieve abdominal closure, which to our knowledge, had never been done before for this indication. Using our experience of this complex case, as well as our experience in transplanting other children with MMA, and through a literature review, we propose a new perioperative management pathway for this complex cohort of transplant recipients.",

Atherosclerosis is rare in children, who typically suffer from fibromuscular dysplasia, neurofibromatosis type 1, Williams syndrome, or certain other rare conditions. Children with renovascular disease often have involvement of other arteries including the aorta and mesenteric and cerebral vessels. The pediatric interventional radiology service has a vital role in the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of renovascular hypertension. Renal vein renin sampling appears to be more useful in children than in adults, because their arterial disease is more often bilateral and segmental. Diagnostic angiography is still superior to less-invasive methods of imaging the renal arteries, especially the smaller branches. Interventional options include angioplasty, stenting, and ethanol ablation. Angioplasty is almost always technically successful and usually gives a worthwhile clinical improvement. Stenting is only used in children when angioplasty fails. Ethanol embolization may be appropriate in children with focal renin-producing areas that are untreatable by angioplasty.",

The present paper describes a case of WS associated with bilateral conductive hearing loss which was not related to secretory otitis media. Hyperacusis was, moreover, present in spite of the conductive deafness. Surgical or prosthetic treatment of hearing loss was delayed because of hyperacusis. Treatment of the hyperacusis by acoustic training, instead, yielded excellent, long-lasting remission of the symptoms.",

After 8% lidocaine spray to the larynx, and then 4% lidocaine spray to the vocal cords and trachea using a bronchoscope, we accomplished awake, fibreoptic-guided orotracheal intubation easily and quickly on the first attempt using a Parker Flex-Tip tube. Difficult tracheal intubation should be anticipated in Williams syndrome patients. Awake, fibreoptic-guided technique is easier and safer than direct laryngoscopy for intubating such patients.",

Williams syndrome has a tetrad of cardiovascular disease, elfin face, mental retardation and hypercalcemia. Operations were performed twice under general anesthesia. Airway management with mask technique was easily performed. Tracheal intubation was accomplished successfully. Anesthesia was induced with propofol, fentanyl, and vecuronium, and maintained with propofol, fentanyl and the inhalation of oxygen with nitrous oxide.

BACKGROUND: Abdominal coarctation is a rare condition, accounting for less than 2% of aortic coarctations. Single patients with abdominal coarctation have been reported with additional vascular disease in pediatric patients. METHODS: Our echocardiography database between January 2001 and January 2012 was searched to identify all patients with abdominal coarctation. Relevant clinical data were reviewed. RESULTS: Nine patients were identified with abdominal coarctation. Median age at diagnosis was 4.7 years (IQR 1.1-14.3 years). Additional cardiac diagnoses were found in three patients: one had moderate aortic regurgitation and aortic root dilatation; one had mild aortic regurgitation, severe mitral regurgitation, and atrial flutter; and one had a thoracic coarctation previously repaired. Eight patients (89%) had an associated noncardiac comorbidity. Comorbidities included: Takayasu arteritis (n = 3), systemic lupus erythematosus (n = 1), epidermal nevus syndrome (n = 1), abdominal hemangioma (n = 1), Williams syndrome (n = 1), and renal artery stenosis (n = 2). Intervention was performed in four patients (57%): two underwent surgical grafting and two had angioplasty with stent placement. Patients with surgical grafting required no further intervention, whereas both patients who underwent angioplasty and stenting required further stent placement. CONCLUSION: Abdominal coarctation is a rare anomaly. It is frequently associated with other vascular abnormalities. Vasculitis should be suspected in children with abdominal coarctation. All patients, even if treated, require continued close observation.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Angioplasty and stent implantation have become accepted therapies for isolated peripheral pulmonary stenosis, and have been shown to increase vessel diameter and reduce right ventricular (RV) pressure acutely in patients with pulmonary artery (PA) stenosis. The purpose of this study was to assess long-term outcomes after primary transcatheter therapy for peripheral pulmonary stenosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 69 patients who underwent primary transcatheter intervention for severe isolated peripheral pulmonary stenosis at <= 5 years of age. Genetic/syndromic diagnoses included Williams syndrome (n=23), non-Williams familial arteriopathy (n=12), and Alagille syndrome (n=3). At the initial PA intervention, median RV:aortic pressure ratio decreased from 1.00 to 0.88 (median decrease, 0.18; P<0.001). Patients with a higher preintervention RV:aortic pressure ratio had a greater reduction (P<0.001). During follow-up (median, 8.5 years), 10 patients died, 5 from complications of PA catheterization (all before 1998). Thirteen patients underwent surgical PA intervention, most within 1 year and along with repair of supravalvar aortic stenosis. Freedom from any PA reintervention was 38 +- 6% at 1 year and 22 +- 6% at 5 years. The median RV:aortic pressure ratio decreased from 1.0 at baseline to 0.53 at the most recent catheterization (P<0.001), and 82% of patients with available clinical follow-up were asymptomatic. CONCLUSIONS: Transcatheter therapy for infants with severe peripheral pulmonary stenosis has become safer, regardless of genetic condition. Coupled with reintervention and surgical relief in selected cases, RV:aortic pressure ratios decrease substantially and most patients are asymptomatic at late follow-up.",

Atherosclerosis is rare in children, who typically suffer from fibromuscular dysplasia, neurofibromatosis type 1, Williams syndrome, or certain other rare conditions. Children with renovascular disease often have involvement of other arteries including the aorta and mesenteric and cerebral vessels. The pediatric interventional radiology service has a vital role in the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of renovascular hypertension. Renal vein renin sampling appears to be more useful in children than in adults, because their arterial disease is more often bilateral and segmental. Diagnostic angiography is still superior to less-invasive methods of imaging the renal arteries, especially the smaller branches. Interventional options include angioplasty, stenting, and ethanol ablation. Angioplasty is almost always technically successful and usually gives a worthwhile clinical improvement. Stenting is only used in children when angioplasty fails. Ethanol embolization may be appropriate in children with focal renin-producing areas that are untreatable by angioplasty.",

METHODS: We studied the clinical outcomes of 37 children aged 8 days to 15 years (median 26 months), who underwent aortic arch reconstruction for arch hypoplasia from 1982 to 1997. The children were divided into three groups: Group 1 (20 patients) had isolated aortic arch lesions, Group 2 (13 patients) had associated intra-cardiac pathology yet conserving a biventricular physiology, Group 3 (4 patients) had Williams Syndrome. Previous interventions for coarctation had been performed in 30 patients (81%). Arch repair consisted of a patch aortoplasty in the majority of patients (35 of 37 children). RESULTS: Operative mortality occurred in 5 children, 4 in Group 2 (31%), 1 in Group 3 (25%) and none in Group 1. Permanent neurological complications occurred in 2 children (5 %). During the follow-up, which ranged from 1 month to 8 years, balloon angioplasty for arch obstruction was required in 1 child. There was one late death, associated with a subsequent intra-cardiac repair. CONCLUSIONS: Aortic arch surgery in children with isolated arch hypoplasia, is associated with excellent early and late survival in addition to a low reintervention rate. Alternative perfusion and operative strategies must be implemented in infants with associated intra-cardiac anomalies to improve results.",

METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively analyzed the data of 15 patients (13 males, mean age 15.5+/-10.18 years) with a diagnosis of supravalvar aortic stenosis confirmed by cardiac catheterization. Five patients had morphological features of Williams' syndrome. One patient had diffuse while the rest had discrete type of supravalvar aortic stenosis. Five patients did not have any associated lesions. A 9-year-old male had an ascending aortic aneurysm, and 3 patients had associated peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis. One child had a subaortic ventricular septal defect, and another had severe mitral regurgitation. Twelve patients had electrocardiographic evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy. Three patients had mild aortic valvar stenosis while 2 had aortic regurgitation. Six patients had dilated coronary arteries. Two patients with supravalvar aortic gradients of 20 and 40 mmHg were kept on close follow-up. One patient was not willing to undergo surgery while the other is awaiting surgery. Eleven patients underwent surgical correction. Dacron or pericardial patch aortoplasty was done in all the patients. In addition, one patient each underwent pulmonary artery plasty, ventricular septal defect closure, repair of ascending aortic aneurysm, and mitral valve replacement. The patient with diffuse type of supravalvar aortic stenosis underwent augmentation aortoplasty. Two patients died perioperatively. One was lost to follow-up. Two had moderate residual gradients. The rest of the patients were in New York Heart Association functional class I on follow-up of 6.3+/-4.7 years. CONCLUSIONS: Repair of supravalvar aortic stenosis by single sinus aortoplasty is safe and produces good results.",

The perfusion was restarted through the tube graft anastomosed to the left carotid artery and the ascending aorta was cross-clamped. The longitudinal incision at the site of prior aortic cannulation disclosed the intramural hematoma at the posterior wall of the ascending aorta.

METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively analyzed the data of 15 patients (13 males, mean age 15.5+/-10.18 years) with a diagnosis of supravalvar aortic stenosis confirmed by cardiac catheterization. Five patients had morphological features of Williams' syndrome. One patient had diffuse while the rest had discrete type of supravalvar aortic stenosis. Five patients did not have any associated lesions. A 9-year-old male had an ascending aortic aneurysm, and 3 patients had associated peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis. One child had a subaortic ventricular septal defect, and another had severe mitral regurgitation. Twelve patients had electrocardiographic evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy. Three patients had mild aortic valvar stenosis while 2 had aortic regurgitation. Six patients had dilated coronary arteries. Two patients with supravalvar aortic gradients of 20 and 40 mmHg were kept on close follow-up. One patient was not willing to undergo surgery while the other is awaiting surgery. Eleven patients underwent surgical correction. Dacron or pericardial patch aortoplasty was done in all the patients. In addition, one patient each underwent pulmonary artery plasty, ventricular septal defect closure, repair of ascending aortic aneurysm, and mitral valve replacement. The patient with diffuse type of supravalvar aortic stenosis underwent augmentation aortoplasty. Two patients died perioperatively. One was lost to follow-up. Two had moderate residual gradients. The rest of the patients were in New York Heart Association functional class I on follow-up of 6.3+/-4.7 years. CONCLUSIONS: Repair of supravalvar aortic stenosis by single sinus aortoplasty is safe and produces good results.",

                    "abstract": "Williams syndrome is caused by the deletion of genetic material from chromosome 7, including the elastin gene. Affected individuals frequently have connective tissue disorders and skeletal hypoplasia, resulting in micrognathia and mandibular retrusion. These conditions hinder adequate visualization of the larynx and render intubation difficult. We used different methods of tracheal intubation for two patients with Williams syndrome. The first case was a 35-year-old woman with micrognathia, mandibular retrusion, and a Mallampati class III airway, scheduled for mitral valve replacement. She had a three fingerbreadth oral aperture, 3.0 cm mandibulohyoid distance, and 30 degree neck flexion. Since she had previously been successfully intubated at age 18 for patch enlargement of the aorta and extended aortoplasty, we elected to use intravenous anesthetic agents for this intubation. After administration of diazepam and fentanyl, mask ventilation was difficult and the direct laryngoscopic view was Cormack grade IV. Fortunately, blind orotracheal intubation using a Mallinckrodt tracheal tube with direct laryngoscopy was accomplished on the first attempt. The second case was a 71-year-old woman with micrognathia, slight mandibular retrusion, macroglossia, and a Mallampati class IV airway, scheduled for sigmoidectomy and insertion of a ureteral stent. She had a 2.5 fingerbreadth oral aperture, 4.0 cm mandibulohyoid distance, and 30 degree neck flexion. From our experience with the first patient, we expected difficult ventilation and intubation. After 8% lidocaine spray to the larynx, and then 4% lidocaine spray to the vocal cords and trachea using a bronchoscope, we accomplished awake, fibreoptic-guided orotracheal intubation easily and quickly on the first attempt using a Parker Flex-Tip tube. Difficult tracheal intubation should be anticipated in Williams syndrome patients. Awake, fibreoptic-guided technique is easier and safer than direct laryngoscopy for intubating such patients.",

METHODS: We studied the clinical outcomes of 37 children aged 8 days to 15 years (median 26 months), who underwent aortic arch reconstruction for arch hypoplasia from 1982 to 1997. The children were divided into three groups: Group 1 (20 patients) had isolated aortic arch lesions, Group 2 (13 patients) had associated intra-cardiac pathology yet conserving a biventricular physiology, Group 3 (4 patients) had Williams Syndrome. Previous interventions for coarctation had been performed in 30 patients (81%). Arch repair consisted of a patch aortoplasty in the majority of patients (35 of 37 children). RESULTS: Operative mortality occurred in 5 children, 4 in Group 2 (31%), 1 in Group 3 (25%) and none in Group 1. Permanent neurological complications occurred in 2 children (5 %). During the follow-up, which ranged from 1 month to 8 years, balloon angioplasty for arch obstruction was required in 1 child. There was one late death, associated with a subsequent intra-cardiac repair. CONCLUSIONS: Aortic arch surgery in children with isolated arch hypoplasia, is associated with excellent early and late survival in addition to a low reintervention rate. Alternative perfusion and operative strategies must be implemented in infants with associated intra-cardiac anomalies to improve results.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Experience of balloon dilation of peripheral pulmonary stenosis (PPS) in Williams syndrome (WS) is limited. METHODS AND RESULTS: Catheterizations in all patients with WS undergoing therapy for PPS from 1984 to 1999 were reviewed. Criteria for successful dilation included an increase >50% in predilation diameter and a decrease >20% in ratio of right ventricular (RV) to aortic (Ao) systolic pressure. Median age and weight were 1.5 years and 9.5 kg. There were 134 dilations during 39 procedures in 25 patients. The success rate for initial dilations was 51%. In multivariate analysis, successful dilation was more likely (1) in distal than in central pulmonary arteries (P=0.02), (2) if the balloon waist resolved with inflation (P=0.001), and (3) with larger balloon/stenosis ratio (P<0.001). RV pressure was unchanged after dilation (96+/-30 versus 97+/-31 mm Hg), primarily because of failure to enlarge central pulmonary arteries. The Ao pressure increased (102+/-14 versus 109+/-19 mm Hg, P=0.03), and the RV/Ao pressure ratio decreased (0.97+/-0.34 versus 0.91+/-0.30, P=0.05). Aneurysms developed after 24 dilations (18%) and were not related to balloon/stenosis ratio. Balloon rupture in 12 dilations produced an aneurysm in all 7 cases when rupture was in a hypoplastic segment. Three patients died, none from pulmonary artery trauma, and all before 1994. CONCLUSIONS: Mortality occurred early in our experience. Despite successful dilation of distal pulmonary arteries, there was modest initial hemodynamic improvement, mainly because of persistent central pulmonary artery obstruction. A serial approach of distal dilations followed by surgical repair of proximal obstruction may be a rational and successful therapy.",

Evaluated was the efficacy of bladed balloon (BB) dilation to address vessels resistant to conventional high-pressure (10-15 atm) balloon angioplasty (BA). Thirty-one procedures were performed on 14 children with age range 1 month to 15 years. The diameter of the BB ranged from 3 to 8 mm. After BB dilation, all children had subsequent conventional BA (balloon size range, 3-10 mm). The minimal lumen diameter (MLD) before and after the procedure, whether there was a waist at initial BA, and BB diameter-to-MLD ratio before the procedure were measured. A > 50% increase in MLD was considered successful. Four children had Williams syndrome, two children Alagille syndrome, five children Fallot's tetralogy, and three miscellaneous lesions. The resistant stenosis was located in the right central pulmonary artery in 6, right branch pulmonary artery in 7, left central pulmonary artery in 6, and left branch pulmonary artery in 12 lesions. Median BB diameter was 253% (117-440%) of the MLD and increased from 2.0 +/- 0.7 to 3.2 +/- 0.8 mm (P < 0.0001), with a mean increase of 73% +/- 62%. There was an inverse relationship between the MLD before and increase after the procedure (r = 0.75; P < 0.001). The BB diameter-to-MLD ratio before procedure was significantly associated with the increase in MLD (r = 0.70; P < 0.001). After the procedure, 18 of the 31 procedures were considered successful. In all successful procedures, the BB diameter was greater than twice the MLD before the procedure. Comparing children with Williams and Alagille syndrome with the remaining eight children, there were no significant differences in the increase in MLD. A small aneurysm and thrombus were noticed in two and three children, respectively, but no fatal complications were reported. BB angioplasty is effective for resistant peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis when conventional BA fails. The diameter of the BB should be larger than twice the minimal luminal diameter of the stenotic lesion.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Controversy remains regarding the optimal surgical approach for children with supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS). METHODS: Since 1997 we have used Brom three-patch aortoplasty for patients with SVAS. We prefer computed tomography (CT) imaging for preoperative evaluation rather than cardiac catheterization as it avoids the well-known morbidity of general anesthesia. The purpose of this study was to present our intermediate-term results of this strategy. RESULTS: Twenty consecutive patients with SVAS were treated with Brom aortoplasty. Mean age was 3.7 +- 5.9 years (median, 1.5 years). Twelve patients had Williams syndrome. Ten patients had preoperative advanced medical imaging (seven CT, three magnetic resonance imaging) and did not have cardiac catheterization. Mean times for cardiopulmonary bypass and cross-clamp were 172 +- 29 minutes and 110 +- 21 minutes, respectively. Ten patients had simultaneous pulmonary artery stenosis patching. Median length of stay was seven days. There was no operative or late mortality. Mean follow-up was 6 +- 5 years. There were no reoperations on the aortic root. Fifteen patients had mild or less aortic insufficiency (AI) and two had moderate AI. One patient who had infant balloon dilation of the aortic valve and postoperative subacute bacterial endocarditis had moderate-to-severe AI and aortic stenosis (AS). One patient had moderate residual SVAS; all others had no AS. No patients had late coronary insufficiency. CONCLUSION: Brom aortoplasty promotes restoration of normal aortic root geometry and relief of coronary ostial stenosis, which is important in preventing myocardial ischemia. Computed tomography imaging is our preferred diagnostic modality. Intermediate-term outcomes are excellent with no recurrent SVAS, coronary events, or reoperations on the aortic valve.",

In this review we evaluated mid-term clinical outcomes of these techniques at our institution. METHODS: Our cardiac surgery database identified patients with SVAS repair from 1990 to 2008. Follow-up records, reintervention and reoperation data, and most recent echocardiograms were obtained. RESULTS: From 1990 to 2008, 20 patients (70% male) underwent surgery for SVAS. Mean age was 3.6 +/- 5.6 years. In chronological sequence, 8 patients had single-patch aortoplasty, 4 had the Doty procedure, and 8 received Brom's symmetric three-patch aortoplasty. Of the Brom patients, 6 had Williams syndrome. Aortic cross-clamp times were 40.1 +/- 13.6 minutes (one-patch), 60.3 +/- 38.8 minutes (Doty), and 104 +/- 20.5 minutes (Brom). Perioperative mortality was 5.0% (1 patient in one-patch group). Mean postoperative length of stay was 10 +/- 10.6 days. Follow-up data were available for all survivors (mean follow-up, 6.3 +/- 6.0 years; range, 6 months to 16 years). There were no late deaths. Follow-up echocardiograms revealed a peak Doppler gradient across the aortic outflow tract of 33 +/- 18.0 mm Hg (one-patch), 10 +/- 1 mm Hg (Doty), and 18 +/- 12 mm Hg (Brom). All patients in the Doty and Brom groups had less than moderate aortic insufficiency. Reoperations were required in 5 of 8 one-patch patients (62%) for residual aortic stenosis (n = 3), aortic insufficiency (n = 1), and subvalvar stenosis (n = 1). No Doty or Brom patient has required aortic reoperations, which was nearly statistically associated with freedom from reoperation (p = 0.06). Subvalvar stenosis was the only risk factor associated with reoperation (p = 0.0028). CONCLUSIONS: Despite a longer cross-clamp time, SVAS repair by Doty or Brom aortoplasty restores normal hemodynamics and reduces the need for reoperation when compared with the classic one-patch technique. Our current preference for SVAS repair is the Brom three-patch symmetric aortoplasty.",

He persistently developed suprasystemic right ventricular (RV) pressure. Angioplasty with a drug-coated balloon (DCB) was performed for in-stent restenosis and to remodel his distal pulmonary vessels bilaterally. This resulted in immediate improvement in the in-stent stenosis and resultant decrease in RV pressure. Follow-up catheterization two months later continued to show long-lasting improvement in the in-stent stenosis. We hypothesize that the anti-proliferative effects of DCBs may be of benefit in the arteriopathy associated with Williams syndrome.

RESULTS: The median delay was longer in Hungary than in Europe (cystic fibrosis: 227 vs. 45 days; Duchenne muscular dystrophy: 467 vs. 360 days; tuberous sclerosis: 155 vs. 120 days). Patients' experience was similar in Hungary and in Europe. The proportion of misdiagnosis was 30.8% in Hungary (Europe: 41%), 34.8% of patients got diagnosis outside of living place region (EU: 26%) and 19.9% of them found the personal expenses too high (EU: 10%).

METHOD: The study was performed in 17 individuals with WS, aged between seven and 17 years old (10 males and seven females), and 17 individuals with typical development age- and gender-matched to individuals with WS. Statistical tests were used to analyze the responses collected with the Loudness Discomfort Level (LDL) test as well as ipsilateral and contralateral reflex responses. RESULTS: Auditory hypersensitivity was commonly found. Individuals with WS had phonophobia and were less tolerant to high sound intensity, presenting a reduced discomfort threshold compared to those with typical development. However, hyperacusis was found in 35.29% of individuals with WS and was mild in 50% of cases. There was an association between hyperacusis and acoustic reflex responses, and individuals with absence of the contralateral acoustic reflex were more likely to have hyperacusis. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with WS have a high prevalence of auditory hypersensitivity, with the presence of phonophobia; however, hyperacusis was not as prevalent and may be associated with the absence of contralateral acoustic reflexes.",

METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively analyzed the data of 15 patients (13 males, mean age 15.5+/-10.18 years) with a diagnosis of supravalvar aortic stenosis confirmed by cardiac catheterization. Five patients had morphological features of Williams' syndrome. One patient had diffuse while the rest had discrete type of supravalvar aortic stenosis. Five patients did not have any associated lesions. A 9-year-old male had an ascending aortic aneurysm, and 3 patients had associated peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis. One child had a subaortic ventricular septal defect, and another had severe mitral regurgitation. Twelve patients had electrocardiographic evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy. Three patients had mild aortic valvar stenosis while 2 had aortic regurgitation. Six patients had dilated coronary arteries. Two patients with supravalvar aortic gradients of 20 and 40 mmHg were kept on close follow-up. One patient was not willing to undergo surgery while the other is awaiting surgery. Eleven patients underwent surgical correction. Dacron or pericardial patch aortoplasty was done in all the patients. In addition, one patient each underwent pulmonary artery plasty, ventricular septal defect closure, repair of ascending aortic aneurysm, and mitral valve replacement. The patient with diffuse type of supravalvar aortic stenosis underwent augmentation aortoplasty. Two patients died perioperatively. One was lost to follow-up. Two had moderate residual gradients. The rest of the patients were in New York Heart Association functional class I on follow-up of 6.3+/-4.7 years. CONCLUSIONS: Repair of supravalvar aortic stenosis by single sinus aortoplasty is safe and produces good results.",

STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective review was undertaken of consecutive patients with WS at our institution from January 1, 1980, through December 31, 2007. WS was diagnosed by an experienced medical geneticist and/or by fluorescence in situ hybridization. CVA were diagnosed with the use of echocardiography, cardiac catheterization, or computerized tomographic angiography. Freedom from intervention was determined using Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS: The study group was 129 patients with CVA. Age at presentation was 127 +/- 116 days, with follow-up of 8.0 +/- 7.5 years (0 to 42 years). The most common lesions were peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis (62%) and supravalvar aortic stenosis (57%). Other CVA were common. CV interventions were performed in 29%, with 58% of those before 1 year. Freedom from intervention was 85%, 73%, and 66% at 1, 5, and 25 years, respectively. Four patients died. CONCLUSIONS: CVA are the most common manifestations of infantile Williams syndrome and occur with greater frequency than previously reported. In those with CVA, interventions are common and usually occur by 5 years of age. Most of these patients do not require intervention on long-term follow-up, and overall mortality is low.",

The technique of symmetric aortoplasty with 3 patches (1 in each sinus) is described and compared with other methods. METHODS: Case reports were reviewed and follow-up was completed by contacting the patient's (pediatric) cardiologist. We aimed for a last follow-up visit, including Doppler echocardiographic studies, in a period no more than 12 months earlier than December 1997. Supravalvular aortic stenosis was discrete in 25 and diffuse with involvement of the aortic arch and arch vessels in 4 patients. Additional anomalies were bicuspid aortic valve (n = 5), coarctation (n = 3), ascending aortic aneurysm (n = 1), mitral valve insufficiency (n = 2), pulmonary valvular stenosis (n = 1), and peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis (n = 2). Eleven patients had Williams syndrome and 1 patient had Noonan syndrome. Symmetric aortoplasty with 3 patches (1 in each sinus) was used in 13 patients, whereas other nonsymmetric methods (1, 2, or Y-shaped patches) were used in 16 patients. Mean follow-up was 10.5 years (range: 4 months-36 years). RESULTS: All techniques adequately decreased the pressure gradient. Progression of preoperative aortic valve insufficiency or de novo regurgitation was not observed except in 1 patient in whom the patches inserted were too large. CONCLUSIONS: No difference could be demonstrated in outcome for any surgical technique; however, reconstruction of the aortic root with autologous pericardial patches in each sinus after transection of the aorta has the advantage of symmetry while restoring the normal aortic root anatomy.",

He persistently developed suprasystemic right ventricular (RV) pressure. Angioplasty with a drug-coated balloon (DCB) was performed for in-stent restenosis and to remodel his distal pulmonary vessels bilaterally. This resulted in immediate improvement in the in-stent stenosis and resultant decrease in RV pressure. Follow-up catheterization two months later continued to show long-lasting improvement in the in-stent stenosis. We hypothesize that the anti-proliferative effects of DCBs may be of benefit in the arteriopathy associated with Williams syndrome.

                    "abstract": "Treatment for peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis is challenging, and conventional balloon angioplasty has not proved to be universally effective. Evaluated was the efficacy of bladed balloon (BB) dilation to address vessels resistant to conventional high-pressure (10-15 atm) balloon angioplasty (BA). Thirty-one procedures were performed on 14 children with age range 1 month to 15 years. The diameter of the BB ranged from 3 to 8 mm. After BB dilation, all children had subsequent conventional BA (balloon size range, 3-10 mm). The minimal lumen diameter (MLD) before and after the procedure, whether there was a waist at initial BA, and BB diameter-to-MLD ratio before the procedure were measured. A > 50% increase in MLD was considered successful. Four children had Williams syndrome, two children Alagille syndrome, five children Fallot's tetralogy, and three miscellaneous lesions. The resistant stenosis was located in the right central pulmonary artery in 6, right branch pulmonary artery in 7, left central pulmonary artery in 6, and left branch pulmonary artery in 12 lesions. Median BB diameter was 253% (117-440%) of the MLD and increased from 2.0 +/- 0.7 to 3.2 +/- 0.8 mm (P < 0.0001), with a mean increase of 73% +/- 62%. There was an inverse relationship between the MLD before and increase after the procedure (r = 0.75; P < 0.001). The BB diameter-to-MLD ratio before procedure was significantly associated with the increase in MLD (r = 0.70; P < 0.001). After the procedure, 18 of the 31 procedures were considered successful. In all successful procedures, the BB diameter was greater than twice the MLD before the procedure. Comparing children with Williams and Alagille syndrome with the remaining eight children, there were no significant differences in the increase in MLD. A small aneurysm and thrombus were noticed in two and three children, respectively, but no fatal complications were reported. BB angioplasty is effective for resistant peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis when conventional BA fails. The diameter of the BB should be larger than twice the minimal luminal diameter of the stenotic lesion.",

BACKGROUND: CBA has emerged as a successful alternative therapy for PAS resistant to conventional balloon angioplasty techniques but there is little information on medium and long-term outcomes. METHODS: This is a descriptive, single center, retrospective chart review of pediatric patients who underwent CBA for PAS at Arkansas Children's Hospital between May 2005 and December 2020. We reviewed demographics, procedural specifics, and 30-day complications. RESULTS: Forty-four patients underwent pulmonary artery CBA on 114 pulmonary artery segments through 126 catheterization cases, totaling 148 CBA events. Thirty-three individual pulmonary arteries underwent repeat intervention. Average minimal luminal diameter increase from pre-CBA to end of follow-up was 57% (CI, 38%-75%). Absence of Tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia and major aortopulmonary collateral arteries (TOF/PA/MAPCAs) and the absence of Alagille Syndrome, Williams Syndrome, or Arterial Tortuosity Syndrome (ATS) were associated with increased odds of sustained success by 70% (CI, 0.11-0.79) and 91% (CI, 0.02-0.56), respectively. Increasing the cutting balloon diameter-to-minimal luminal diameter ratio by 0.5 increased odds of successful intervention by 2.37-fold (CI, 1.7-3.3). Seven patients had 30-day complications including one death. CONCLUSIONS: In the longest follow-up to date of children and adolescents who underwent CBA for branch PAS, we found that there was moderate medium-term success. Additionally, absence of TOF/PA/MAPCAs, absence of Alagille Syndrome, Williams Syndrome, or ATS, and high cutting balloon diameter-to-minimal luminal diameter ratio are predictors of sustained results.",

Atherosclerosis is rare in children, who typically suffer from fibromuscular dysplasia, neurofibromatosis type 1, Williams syndrome, or certain other rare conditions. Children with renovascular disease often have involvement of other arteries including the aorta and mesenteric and cerebral vessels. The pediatric interventional radiology service has a vital role in the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of renovascular hypertension. Renal vein renin sampling appears to be more useful in children than in adults, because their arterial disease is more often bilateral and segmental. Diagnostic angiography is still superior to less-invasive methods of imaging the renal arteries, especially the smaller branches. Interventional options include angioplasty, stenting, and ethanol ablation. Angioplasty is almost always technically successful and usually gives a worthwhile clinical improvement. Stenting is only used in children when angioplasty fails. Ethanol embolization may be appropriate in children with focal renin-producing areas that are untreatable by angioplasty.",

METHODS: 252 Hungarian patients (cystic fibrosis; Duchenne muscular dystrophy; tuberous sclerosis, retinitis pigmentosa, and Williams' syndrome) completed the questionnaires. RESULTS: The median delay was longer in Hungary than in Europe (cystic fibrosis: 227 vs. 45 days; Duchenne muscular dystrophy: 467 vs. 360 days; tuberous sclerosis: 155 vs. 120 days). Patients' experience was similar in Hungary and in Europe. The proportion of misdiagnosis was 30.8% in Hungary (Europe: 41%), 34.8% of patients got diagnosis outside of living place region (EU: 26%) and 19.9% of them found the personal expenses too high (EU: 10%). Delivery of the diagnosis was unnecessary according to 27.4% of Hungarian patients (EU: 35%).

The perfusion was restarted through the tube graft anastomosed to the left carotid artery and the ascending aorta was cross-clamped. The longitudinal incision at the site of prior aortic cannulation disclosed the intramural hematoma at the posterior wall of the ascending aorta.

METHODS: The mothers of 49 subjects with WS were asked to complete the Hyperacusis Screening Questionnaire. Subjects with reported hyperacusis and sufficient developmental capacity underwent comprehensive audiological and brain auditory evoked response (BAER) testing. Findings were compared with those from pair-matched typically developing control subjects. RESULTS: Forty-one of the 49 children with WS (84%) had hyperacusis of moderate to severe degree, which began in infancy. Of these, 21 (mean age 15.8 +/- 5.5 years) were quantitatively tested. Subjects with WS reported discomfort at sound intensities on average 20 dB lower than control subjects. Pure-tone audiometry and distortion products otoacoustic emission test revealed a high-frequency cochlear hearing loss. An absence of ipsilateral acoustic reflex responses to maximum stimulation was significantly more common in the subjects with WS than controls. On BAER testing, the WS group had a significant prolongation in wave I latency. CONCLUSIONS: Hyperacusis in Williams syndrome (WS) is associated with a high-frequency hearing loss resembling the configuration of noise-induced hearing loss. The hyperacusis and hearing loss in WS may stem from a deficiency in the acoustic reflex resulting from auditory nerve dysfunction. Additional mechanisms that may mediate hyperacusis in WS and should be evaluated in future studies include recruitment, malformation of the facial canal, and haploinsufficiency of the elastin gene.",

The technique of symmetric aortoplasty with 3 patches (1 in each sinus) is described and compared with other methods. METHODS: Case reports were reviewed and follow-up was completed by contacting the patient's (pediatric) cardiologist. We aimed for a last follow-up visit, including Doppler echocardiographic studies, in a period no more than 12 months earlier than December 1997. Supravalvular aortic stenosis was discrete in 25 and diffuse with involvement of the aortic arch and arch vessels in 4 patients. Additional anomalies were bicuspid aortic valve (n = 5), coarctation (n = 3), ascending aortic aneurysm (n = 1), mitral valve insufficiency (n = 2), pulmonary valvular stenosis (n = 1), and peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis (n = 2). Eleven patients had Williams syndrome and 1 patient had Noonan syndrome. Symmetric aortoplasty with 3 patches (1 in each sinus) was used in 13 patients, whereas other nonsymmetric methods (1, 2, or Y-shaped patches) were used in 16 patients. Mean follow-up was 10.5 years (range: 4 months-36 years). RESULTS: All techniques adequately decreased the pressure gradient. Progression of preoperative aortic valve insufficiency or de novo regurgitation was not observed except in 1 patient in whom the patches inserted were too large. CONCLUSIONS: No difference could be demonstrated in outcome for any surgical technique; however, reconstruction of the aortic root with autologous pericardial patches in each sinus after transection of the aorta has the advantage of symmetry while restoring the normal aortic root anatomy.",

Of the Brom patients, 6 had Williams syndrome. Aortic cross-clamp times were 40.1 +/- 13.6 minutes (one-patch), 60.3 +/- 38.8 minutes (Doty), and 104 +/- 20.5 minutes (Brom). Perioperative mortality was 5.0% (1 patient in one-patch group). Mean postoperative length of stay was 10 +/- 10.6 days. Follow-up data were available for all survivors (mean follow-up, 6.3 +/- 6.0 years; range, 6 months to 16 years). There were no late deaths. Follow-up echocardiograms revealed a peak Doppler gradient across the aortic outflow tract of 33 +/- 18.0 mm Hg (one-patch), 10 +/- 1 mm Hg (Doty), and 18 +/- 12 mm Hg (Brom). All patients in the Doty and Brom groups had less than moderate aortic insufficiency. Reoperations were required in 5 of 8 one-patch patients (62%) for residual aortic stenosis (n = 3), aortic insufficiency (n = 1), and subvalvar stenosis (n = 1). No Doty or Brom patient has required aortic reoperations, which was nearly statistically associated with freedom from reoperation (p = 0.06). Subvalvar stenosis was the only risk factor associated with reoperation (p = 0.0028). CONCLUSIONS: Despite a longer cross-clamp time, SVAS repair by Doty or Brom aortoplasty restores normal hemodynamics and reduces the need for reoperation when compared with the classic one-patch technique. Our current preference for SVAS repair is the Brom three-patch symmetric aortoplasty.",

                    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Williams syndrome (WS) results from a microdeletion that usually involves the elastin gene, leading to generalized arteriopathy. Cardiovascular anomalies are seen in 80% of WS patients, including supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS), pulmonary artery stenosis (PAS), and pulmonary stenosis (PS). Sudden death associated with procedural sedation and in the perioperative period in WS children have been reported. This study aims to describe extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) use in WS children, identify risk factors for hospital mortality of WS patients, and compare outcomes between WS children and non-WS children with SVAS, PAS, and PS. METHODS: Children 0-18 years-old in the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) Registry with a primary or secondary diagnosis of WS, SVAS, PAS, or PAS were included. RESULTS: Included were 50 WS children and 1222 non-WS children with similar cardiac diagnoses. ECMO use increased over time in both groups (p = 0.93), with most cases occurring in the current era. WS children were younger (p = 0.004), weighed less (p = 0.048), had a pulmonary indication for ECMO (50% vs 10%, p < 0.001), and were placed more on high frequency ventilation (p < 0.001) than non-WS patients. Despite reporting a respiratory indication, most (84%) WS patients were placed on VA-ECMO. There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of pre-ECMO cardiac arrest, ECMO duration, or reason for ECMO discontinuation. Both groups had a mortality rate of 48% (p = 1.00). No risk factors for WS mortality were identified.",

SCD has been reported in cases without any evidence of structural cardiovascular anomalies. Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is characterized by short PR interval and delta wave. Ventricular preexcitations can develop paroxysmal reentrant tachycardia through Kent bundle or less frequent atrial fibrillation and in some cases with accessory pathway effective refractory period (APERP) under 250 ms considered as risky and may lead to SCD.

CASE REPORT: An 11-year-old male who had been followed up with WS was referred to pediatric cardiology outpatient clinic with the complaint of palpitation.

METHOD: The study was performed in 17 individuals with WS, aged between seven and 17 years old (10 males and seven females), and 17 individuals with typical development age- and gender-matched to individuals with WS. Statistical tests were used to analyze the responses collected with the Loudness Discomfort Level (LDL) test as well as ipsilateral and contralateral reflex responses. RESULTS: Auditory hypersensitivity was commonly found. Individuals with WS had phonophobia and were less tolerant to high sound intensity, presenting a reduced discomfort threshold compared to those with typical development. However, hyperacusis was found in 35.29% of individuals with WS and was mild in 50% of cases. There was an association between hyperacusis and acoustic reflex responses, and individuals with absence of the contralateral acoustic reflex were more likely to have hyperacusis. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with WS have a high prevalence of auditory hypersensitivity, with the presence of phonophobia; however, hyperacusis was not as prevalent and may be associated with the absence of contralateral acoustic reflexes.",

Cardiovascular anomalies are seen in 80% of WS patients, including supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS), pulmonary artery stenosis (PAS), and pulmonary stenosis (PS). Sudden death associated with procedural sedation and in the perioperative period in WS children have been reported. This study aims to describe extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) use in WS children, identify risk factors for hospital mortality of WS patients, and compare outcomes between WS children and non-WS children with SVAS, PAS, and PS. METHODS: Children 0-18 years-old in the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) Registry with a primary or secondary diagnosis of WS, SVAS, PAS, or PAS were included. RESULTS: Included were 50 WS children and 1222 non-WS children with similar cardiac diagnoses. ECMO use increased over time in both groups (p = 0.93), with most cases occurring in the current era. WS children were younger (p = 0.004), weighed less (p = 0.048), had a pulmonary indication for ECMO (50% vs 10%, p < 0.001), and were placed more on high frequency ventilation (p < 0.001) than non-WS patients. Despite reporting a respiratory indication, most (84%) WS patients were placed on VA-ECMO. There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of pre-ECMO cardiac arrest, ECMO duration, or reason for ECMO discontinuation. Both groups had a mortality rate of 48% (p = 1.00). No risk factors for WS mortality were identified.",

However, some patients with WS can have severe hypercalcemia and do not respond well to traditional therapies. Recently, pamidronate has been used in the treatment of childhood hypercalcemia associated with many disorders, but there is little experience with the treatment of hypercalcemia with bisphosphonates in patients with WS. We present a 17-month-old female patient, who had been diagnosed as WS by genetic analysis, admitted to our clinic for the investigation of severe hypercalcemia (4.02 mmol/L). Because the patient did not respond very well to fluid administration, furosemide infusion, and dietary calcium restriction, pamidronate infusion was performed and calcium levels returned to normal within 2 days. This case report is presented to point out that pamidronate therapy seems to be a safe and efficient way of treating life-threatening hypercalcemia in WS.",

He persistently developed suprasystemic right ventricular (RV) pressure. Angioplasty with a drug-coated balloon (DCB) was performed for in-stent restenosis and to remodel his distal pulmonary vessels bilaterally. This resulted in immediate improvement in the in-stent stenosis and resultant decrease in RV pressure. Follow-up catheterization two months later continued to show long-lasting improvement in the in-stent stenosis. We hypothesize that the anti-proliferative effects of DCBs may be of benefit in the arteriopathy associated with Williams syndrome. We report this as a novel use of a DCB in the pulmonary arterial circulation in a patient with Williams syndrome.",

This brings up new challenges in all aspects of their care. METHODS: We describe the first report of a small child receiving a simultaneous liver and kidney transplant and abdominal rectus sheath fascia transplant on the background of Williams syndrome and methylmalonic acidaemia. At the time of transplantation, the child was 3 years old, weighed 14.0 kg, had chronic kidney disease stage V, and had not yet started any other form of kidney replacement therapy. RESULTS: There were many anaesthetic, medical, metabolic, and surgical challenges to consider in this case. A long general anaesthetic time increased the risk of cardiac complications and metabolic decompensation. Additionally, the small size of the patient and the organ size mis-match meant that primary abdominal closure was not possible. The patient's recovery was further complicated by sepsis, transient CNI toxicity, and de novo DSAs. CONCLUSIONS: Through a multidisciplinary approach between 9 specialties in 4 hospitals across England and Wales, and detailed pre-operative planning, a good outcome was achieved for this child. An hour by hour management protocol was drafted to facilitate transplant and included five domains: 1. management at the time of organ offer; 2. before the admission; 3. at admission and before theatre time; 4. intra-operative management; and 5. post-operative management in the first 24 h. Importantly, gaining a clear and in depth understanding of the metabolic state of the patient pre- and peri-operatively was crucial in avoiding metabolic decompensation. Furthermore, an abdominal rectus sheath fascia transplant was required to achieve abdominal closure, which to our knowledge, had never been done before for this indication. Using our experience of this complex case, as well as our experience in transplanting other children with MMA, and through a literature review, we propose a new perioperative management pathway for this complex cohort of transplant recipients.",

Cardiovascular anomalies are seen in 80% of WS patients, including supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS), pulmonary artery stenosis (PAS), and pulmonary stenosis (PS). Sudden death associated with procedural sedation and in the perioperative period in WS children have been reported. This study aims to describe extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) use in WS children, identify risk factors for hospital mortality of WS patients, and compare outcomes between WS children and non-WS children with SVAS, PAS, and PS. METHODS: Children 0-18 years-old in the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) Registry with a primary or secondary diagnosis of WS, SVAS, PAS, or PAS were included. RESULTS: Included were 50 WS children and 1222 non-WS children with similar cardiac diagnoses. ECMO use increased over time in both groups (p = 0.93), with most cases occurring in the current era. WS children were younger (p = 0.004), weighed less (p = 0.048), had a pulmonary indication for ECMO (50% vs 10%, p < 0.001), and were placed more on high frequency ventilation (p < 0.001) than non-WS patients. Despite reporting a respiratory indication, most (84%) WS patients were placed on VA-ECMO. There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of pre-ECMO cardiac arrest, ECMO duration, or reason for ECMO discontinuation. Both groups had a mortality rate of 48% (p = 1.00). No risk factors for WS mortality were identified.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hyperacusis and phonophobia are common, debilitating symptoms in Williams syndrome (WS), yet little is known about their underlying audiologic and neurologic processes. METHODS: The mothers of 49 subjects with WS were asked to complete the Hyperacusis Screening Questionnaire. Subjects with reported hyperacusis and sufficient developmental capacity underwent comprehensive audiological and brain auditory evoked response (BAER) testing. Findings were compared with those from pair-matched typically developing control subjects. RESULTS: Forty-one of the 49 children with WS (84%) had hyperacusis of moderate to severe degree, which began in infancy. Of these, 21 (mean age 15.8 +/- 5.5 years) were quantitatively tested. Subjects with WS reported discomfort at sound intensities on average 20 dB lower than control subjects. Pure-tone audiometry and distortion products otoacoustic emission test revealed a high-frequency cochlear hearing loss. An absence of ipsilateral acoustic reflex responses to maximum stimulation was significantly more common in the subjects with WS than controls. On BAER testing, the WS group had a significant prolongation in wave I latency. CONCLUSIONS: Hyperacusis in Williams syndrome (WS) is associated with a high-frequency hearing loss resembling the configuration of noise-induced hearing loss. The hyperacusis and hearing loss in WS may stem from a deficiency in the acoustic reflex resulting from auditory nerve dysfunction. Additional mechanisms that may mediate hyperacusis in WS and should be evaluated in future studies include recruitment, malformation of the facial canal, and haploinsufficiency of the elastin gene.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Controversy remains regarding the optimal surgical approach for children with supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS). METHODS: Since 1997 we have used Brom three-patch aortoplasty for patients with SVAS. We prefer computed tomography (CT) imaging for preoperative evaluation rather than cardiac catheterization as it avoids the well-known morbidity of general anesthesia. The purpose of this study was to present our intermediate-term results of this strategy. RESULTS: Twenty consecutive patients with SVAS were treated with Brom aortoplasty. Mean age was 3.7 +- 5.9 years (median, 1.5 years). Twelve patients had Williams syndrome. Ten patients had preoperative advanced medical imaging (seven CT, three magnetic resonance imaging) and did not have cardiac catheterization. Mean times for cardiopulmonary bypass and cross-clamp were 172 +- 29 minutes and 110 +- 21 minutes, respectively. Ten patients had simultaneous pulmonary artery stenosis patching. Median length of stay was seven days. There was no operative or late mortality. Mean follow-up was 6 +- 5 years. There were no reoperations on the aortic root. Fifteen patients had mild or less aortic insufficiency (AI) and two had moderate AI. One patient who had infant balloon dilation of the aortic valve and postoperative subacute bacterial endocarditis had moderate-to-severe AI and aortic stenosis (AS). One patient had moderate residual SVAS; all others had no AS. No patients had late coronary insufficiency. CONCLUSION: Brom aortoplasty promotes restoration of normal aortic root geometry and relief of coronary ostial stenosis, which is important in preventing myocardial ischemia. Computed tomography imaging is our preferred diagnostic modality. Intermediate-term outcomes are excellent with no recurrent SVAS, coronary events, or reoperations on the aortic valve.",

We present a 17-month-old female patient, who had been diagnosed as WS by genetic analysis, admitted to our clinic for the investigation of severe hypercalcemia (4.02 mmol/L). Because the patient did not respond very well to fluid administration, furosemide infusion, and dietary calcium restriction, pamidronate infusion was performed and calcium levels returned to normal within 2 days.

                    "abstract": "Williams syndrome (WS) is a multisystem congenital disorder affecting 1/8000 live births. Our objective was to review our experience with stenosis of the thoracic aorta (STA) in these patients. A retrospective review was undertaken of consecutive WS patients at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia from January 1, 1980, through December 31, 2007. WS was diagnosed by an experienced medical geneticist and/or by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Stenosis was diagnosed with either echocardiography or cardiac catheterization. Freedom from intervention was determined using Kaplan-Meier analysis. From a total cohort of 270 patients, 37 (14%) patients with STA were identified and comprised the study group. Age at presentation was 2.1 + or - 4.0 years, and follow-up was 11.8 + or - 12.6 years (range 0-51). Long-segment STA was more common (89%) than discrete STA. Severity of STA was mild in 18, moderate in 10, and severe in 9 patients. Branch pulmonary artery stenosis was seen in 62% (23 of 37) of STA patients, and supravalvar aortic stenosis was seen in 54% (20 of 37) STA patients. Nine (24%) patients underwent intervention for STA: 8 cases were severe, and 1 case was moderate. Restenosis resulting in reintervention occurred in 5 of 9 (56%) patients, with 4 of 5 (80%) patients undergoing multiple reinterventions. Freedom from intervention was 89, 82, and 73% at 1, 5, and 20 years, respectively. One patient died. STA is common in WS and is generally the long-segment type. In patients with STA, interventions are common and usually occur by 5 years of age. Reintervention for STA occurs frequently.",

                    "abstract": "Williams syndrome is caused by the deletion of genetic material from chromosome 7, including the elastin gene. Affected individuals frequently have connective tissue disorders and skeletal hypoplasia, resulting in micrognathia and mandibular retrusion. These conditions hinder adequate visualization of the larynx and render intubation difficult. We used different methods of tracheal intubation for two patients with Williams syndrome. The first case was a 35-year-old woman with micrognathia, mandibular retrusion, and a Mallampati class III airway, scheduled for mitral valve replacement. She had a three fingerbreadth oral aperture, 3.0 cm mandibulohyoid distance, and 30 degree neck flexion. Since she had previously been successfully intubated at age 18 for patch enlargement of the aorta and extended aortoplasty, we elected to use intravenous anesthetic agents for this intubation. After administration of diazepam and fentanyl, mask ventilation was difficult and the direct laryngoscopic view was Cormack grade IV. Fortunately, blind orotracheal intubation using a Mallinckrodt tracheal tube with direct laryngoscopy was accomplished on the first attempt. The second case was a 71-year-old woman with micrognathia, slight mandibular retrusion, macroglossia, and a Mallampati class IV airway, scheduled for sigmoidectomy and insertion of a ureteral stent. She had a 2.5 fingerbreadth oral aperture, 4.0 cm mandibulohyoid distance, and 30 degree neck flexion. From our experience with the first patient, we expected difficult ventilation and intubation. After 8% lidocaine spray to the larynx, and then 4% lidocaine spray to the vocal cords and trachea using a bronchoscope, we accomplished awake, fibreoptic-guided orotracheal intubation easily and quickly on the first attempt using a Parker Flex-Tip tube. Difficult tracheal intubation should be anticipated in Williams syndrome patients. Awake, fibreoptic-guided technique is easier and safer than direct laryngoscopy for intubating such patients.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECT: Isolated cervical canal stenosis at the level of the atlas (C-1) is a rare cause of cervical myelopathy in the pediatric population. It has been associated with several genetic disorders including spondyloepiphysial dysplasia congenita, Down syndrome, and Klippel-Feil syndrome. The purpose of this study is to highlight the authors' experience with 4 additional pediatric cases, review the literature, and report a new association of this disease with Williams syndrome. METHODS: The medical records and radiological imaging studies of 4 patients treated at Texas Children's Hospital for symptomatic hypoplasia of the atlas were retrospectively reviewed. Pertinent patient demographic data, clinical presentation, imaging findings, and outcomes after surgery were recorded. A thorough literature review was performed, allowing the authors to compare and contrast their 4 cases to surgical cases already published in the literature. RESULTS: There were 11 boys and 1 girl in the aggregate series. The average age of the patients was 7 years (range 13 months-14 years), and the duration of symptoms prior to presentation was 6 months (range 0-36 months). The mean sagittal diameter of the spinal canal at the level of the atlas measured from the posterior aspect of the dens to the anterior aspect of the arch of C-1 was 11.9 mm (range 8.3-16 mm) in the aggregate series. In 2 new pediatric patients with hypoplasia of the atlas the disease was associated with Williams syndrome, which has not been previously described. Patients in the aggregate series were followed for an average of 18 months (range 3-50 months). Laminectomy of C-1 provided neurological improvement in all patients who presented. CONCLUSIONS: Isolated cervical spinal canal stenosis at the level of the atlas is a rare cause of cervical myelopathy. The authors hope that this report will prompt clinicians to consider it when searching for the origin of signs and symptoms of cervical myelopathy, especially in children.",

The perfusion was restarted through the tube graft anastomosed to the left carotid artery and the ascending aorta was cross-clamped. The longitudinal incision at the site of prior aortic cannulation disclosed the intramural hematoma at the posterior wall of the ascending aorta.

In this review we evaluated mid-term clinical outcomes of these techniques at our institution. METHODS: Our cardiac surgery database identified patients with SVAS repair from 1990 to 2008. Follow-up records, reintervention and reoperation data, and most recent echocardiograms were obtained. RESULTS: From 1990 to 2008, 20 patients (70% male) underwent surgery for SVAS. Mean age was 3.6 +/- 5.6 years. In chronological sequence, 8 patients had single-patch aortoplasty, 4 had the Doty procedure, and 8 received Brom's symmetric three-patch aortoplasty. Of the Brom patients, 6 had Williams syndrome. Aortic cross-clamp times were 40.1 +/- 13.6 minutes (one-patch), 60.3 +/- 38.8 minutes (Doty), and 104 +/- 20.5 minutes (Brom). Perioperative mortality was 5.0% (1 patient in one-patch group). Mean postoperative length of stay was 10 +/- 10.6 days. Follow-up data were available for all survivors (mean follow-up, 6.3 +/- 6.0 years; range, 6 months to 16 years). There were no late deaths. Follow-up echocardiograms revealed a peak Doppler gradient across the aortic outflow tract of 33 +/- 18.0 mm Hg (one-patch), 10 +/- 1 mm Hg (Doty), and 18 +/- 12 mm Hg (Brom). All patients in the Doty and Brom groups had less than moderate aortic insufficiency. Reoperations were required in 5 of 8 one-patch patients (62%) for residual aortic stenosis (n = 3), aortic insufficiency (n = 1), and subvalvar stenosis (n = 1). No Doty or Brom patient has required aortic reoperations, which was nearly statistically associated with freedom from reoperation (p = 0.06). Subvalvar stenosis was the only risk factor associated with reoperation (p = 0.0028). CONCLUSIONS: Despite a longer cross-clamp time, SVAS repair by Doty or Brom aortoplasty restores normal hemodynamics and reduces the need for reoperation when compared with the classic one-patch technique. Our current preference for SVAS repair is the Brom three-patch symmetric aortoplasty.",

Twenty-one patients aged 6-26 years with a genetically confirmed diagnosis of WS and with reported hyperacusis were compared with 21 normally developing age-matched subjects. The medial olivocochlear (MOC) efferent system was tested by stimulation of the contralateral ear with increasing levels of white noise, while recording transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE) in the ipsilateral ear. The suppression effect on the amplitudes of the TEOAE was computed for each contralateral stimulus level. This measure reflects the strength of the MOC efferent system. In addition, the thresholds of ipsilateral and contralateral acoustic reflexes in response to 1, 2 and 4 kHz tones as well as to broadband stimuli were also recorded. Results showed that patients with WS had a significantly higher suppression effect of the MOC reflex on TEOAE. Ipsilateral and contralateral acoustic reflexes to tonal and broadband stimuli presented at maximum stimulus intensities were absent in 62-86% of the patients with WS. In the remainder, acoustic reflexes were elicited at lower auditory sensation thresholds than in controls. Hyperexcitability of the MOC efferent system coupled with absence of acoustic reflexes may contribute to the hyperacusis in WS and the consequent high-tone hearing loss induced by environmental noise. Both measures can be used for objective detection and thus, intervention of hyperacusis in the early stages of life.",

METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively analyzed the data of 15 patients (13 males, mean age 15.5+/-10.18 years) with a diagnosis of supravalvar aortic stenosis confirmed by cardiac catheterization. Five patients had morphological features of Williams' syndrome. One patient had diffuse while the rest had discrete type of supravalvar aortic stenosis. Five patients did not have any associated lesions. A 9-year-old male had an ascending aortic aneurysm, and 3 patients had associated peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis. One child had a subaortic ventricular septal defect, and another had severe mitral regurgitation. Twelve patients had electrocardiographic evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy. Three patients had mild aortic valvar stenosis while 2 had aortic regurgitation. Six patients had dilated coronary arteries. Two patients with supravalvar aortic gradients of 20 and 40 mmHg were kept on close follow-up. One patient was not willing to undergo surgery while the other is awaiting surgery. Eleven patients underwent surgical correction. Dacron or pericardial patch aortoplasty was done in all the patients. In addition, one patient each underwent pulmonary artery plasty, ventricular septal defect closure, repair of ascending aortic aneurysm, and mitral valve replacement. The patient with diffuse type of supravalvar aortic stenosis underwent augmentation aortoplasty. Two patients died perioperatively. One was lost to follow-up. Two had moderate residual gradients. The rest of the patients were in New York Heart Association functional class I on follow-up of 6.3+/-4.7 years. CONCLUSIONS: Repair of supravalvar aortic stenosis by single sinus aortoplasty is safe and produces good results.",

This brings up new challenges in all aspects of their care. METHODS: We describe the first report of a small child receiving a simultaneous liver and kidney transplant and abdominal rectus sheath fascia transplant on the background of Williams syndrome and methylmalonic acidaemia. At the time of transplantation, the child was 3 years old, weighed 14.0 kg, had chronic kidney disease stage V, and had not yet started any other form of kidney replacement therapy. RESULTS: There were many anaesthetic, medical, metabolic, and surgical challenges to consider in this case. A long general anaesthetic time increased the risk of cardiac complications and metabolic decompensation. Additionally, the small size of the patient and the organ size mis-match meant that primary abdominal closure was not possible. The patient's recovery was further complicated by sepsis, transient CNI toxicity, and de novo DSAs. CONCLUSIONS: Through a multidisciplinary approach between 9 specialties in 4 hospitals across England and Wales, and detailed pre-operative planning, a good outcome was achieved for this child. An hour by hour management protocol was drafted to facilitate transplant and included five domains: 1. management at the time of organ offer; 2. before the admission; 3. at admission and before theatre time; 4. intra-operative management; and 5. post-operative management in the first 24 h. Importantly, gaining a clear and in depth understanding of the metabolic state of the patient pre- and peri-operatively was crucial in avoiding metabolic decompensation. Furthermore, an abdominal rectus sheath fascia transplant was required to achieve abdominal closure, which to our knowledge, had never been done before for this indication. Using our experience of this complex case, as well as our experience in transplanting other children with MMA, and through a literature review, we propose a new perioperative management pathway for this complex cohort of transplant recipients.",

Cardiovascular abnormalities, because of elastin deficiency, are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with Williams syndrome. The present article presents a review of the most recent developments regarding the cardiovascular issues in Williams syndrome. RECENT FINDINGS: Cardiovascular abnormalities occur in 80% of patients with Williams syndrome, the majority of which are arterial stenoses. The stenoses seen in Williams syndrome now appear to arise from deficient circumferential arterial growth. Pharmacological therapies aimed at improving the vascular stenoses have shown some promise in animal models. Surgical outcomes for supravalvar aortic stenosis are good at most centers. Transcatheter interventions are largely ineffective in Williams syndrome. Multilevel surgical pulmonary artery reconstruction has excellent results for peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis. Periprocedural risk stratification and management algorithms may decrease the risk of cardiovascular complications. SUMMARY: Cardiovascular abnormalities are a major determining factor in the clinical picture and trajectory of patients with Williams syndrome. Advances in surgical techniques, medical therapeutic options, and periprocedural management hold promise for significant improvements in the cardiovascular outcomes of these patients.",

At age 6 months, the infant demonstrated infantile spasms and craniosynostosis and was operated on for craniosynostosis and treated with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) for the infantile spasms. ACTH completely controlled the seizures, but was halted because of the progression of ventricular hypertrophy. The seizure returned, and he was found to have elfin face, failure-to-thrive, developmental delay, and dental malformation in addition to congenital heart defects. High-resolution chromosome analysis revealed interstitial deletion of 7q11.22-q11.23. Therefore his clinical and cytogenetic diagnosis was Williams syndrome. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) therapy reduced his seizures and improved the findings of EEG without cardiac side effects. In addition, his psychomotor development was slightly improved.",

One previously reported case showed an association with apnoeic seizures while a few other cases showed an association with infantile epileptic spasms and generalized and focal seizures. We report the case of a 13-month-old boy with a deletion typically associated with Williams-Beuren syndrome, who presented with isolated apnoeic seizures which were refractory to multiple antiepileptic drugs but partially responsive to the ketogenic diet. The diagnosis was challenging due to a complex cardiac history, gastroesophageal reflux, and normal interictal EEG findings. This case highlights the importance of prolonged EEG monitoring in suspected cases of apnoeic seizures. Further, given the reported cases of unexplained sudden death in Williams-Beuren syndrome, this case raises the possibility of an association between apnoeic seizures and unexplained sudden death.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Results of aortic arch reconstruction in the setting of biventricular physiology are well documented in the adult population, however, in children, surgical outcome of this subgroup of patients is less clear. METHODS: We studied the clinical outcomes of 37 children aged 8 days to 15 years (median 26 months), who underwent aortic arch reconstruction for arch hypoplasia from 1982 to 1997. The children were divided into three groups: Group 1 (20 patients) had isolated aortic arch lesions, Group 2 (13 patients) had associated intra-cardiac pathology yet conserving a biventricular physiology, Group 3 (4 patients) had Williams Syndrome. Previous interventions for coarctation had been performed in 30 patients (81%). Arch repair consisted of a patch aortoplasty in the majority of patients (35 of 37 children). RESULTS: Operative mortality occurred in 5 children, 4 in Group 2 (31%), 1 in Group 3 (25%) and none in Group 1. Permanent neurological complications occurred in 2 children (5 %). During the follow-up, which ranged from 1 month to 8 years, balloon angioplasty for arch obstruction was required in 1 child. There was one late death, associated with a subsequent intra-cardiac repair. CONCLUSIONS: Aortic arch surgery in children with isolated arch hypoplasia, is associated with excellent early and late survival in addition to a low reintervention rate. Alternative perfusion and operative strategies must be implemented in infants with associated intra-cardiac anomalies to improve results.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) represents a heterogeneous group, including Williams syndrome, familial elastin arteriopathy, sporadic cases, and others. This study sought to evaluate long-term outcomes of SVAS repair. METHODS: A total of 87 patients underwent surgical repair of congenital SVAS at Boston Children's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, between 1997 and 2017. A total of 41 patients had Williams syndrome, and 46 did not. Of the 46 patients who did not have Williams syndrome, 23 had sporadic SVAS, and 13 had familial elastin arteriopathy. Demographic data and outcomes were reviewed and analyzed from medical records. RESULTS: The median age at operation was 2.9 years. Mean z score of the sinotubular junction was -3.29 +- 1.42 and of the aortic root was -0.09 +- 1.19. A total of 26% (n = 22) patients had coronary ostium stenosis, and 41% (n = 9) of them required patch plasty. Survival rates at 5, 10, and 20 years were all 94.3%. Freedom from left ventricular outflow tract reoperation at 5, 10, and 20 years was 78.5%, 70.3%, and 70.3%, respectively. Freedom from aortic arch reintervention at 5, 10, and 20 years was 98.6%, 94.3%, 89.3%, respectively. In risk factors analysis, age younger than 1 year, z scores of the aortic valve and aortic root, and concomitant right ventricular outflow tract surgical repair were predictive of the need for reoperation and reintervention for left or right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. CONCLUSIONS: Excellent long-term survival rates can be achieved with surgical repair of SVAS. Age younger than 1 year, small aortic valve and aortic root z scores, and concomitant right ventricular outflow tract surgical repair were predictors of reoperation and reintervention.",

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty children (aged 5 days to 15 years) were studied and treated for RVH during 1977-1998. In 14 cases hypertension was found during a routine examination. Six cases had heart failure and/or hypertensive encephalopathy. Diagnosis was made with aortography. Post-captopril renography and Doppler ultrasonography were obtained in 8 patients and spiral computed tomography angiography in 2. Treatment consisted of surgery (8 patients), percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) (5) or antihypertensive drugs only (8). RESULTS: Initial blood pressure was 62 +/- 31 mmHg > 95th percentile for systolic and 44 +/- 22 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure. Twelve children had unilateral and 8 had bilateral arterial stenosis. In 3 cases lesions were intrarenal. RVH was due to fibromuscular dysplasia (7 patients) and associated to middle aortic syndrome (5). neurofibromatosis (3), William's syndrome (2). Takayasu's arteritis (1) and pheochromocytoma (1). Treatment of choice was decided depending on the size of the child and location and severity of the stenosis. At the end of the follow-up (78 +/- 49 months), 9 patients are normotensive without medication and 7 are normotensive with drugs. Three patients have died, 2 for unrelated causes and I for cardiac failure; 1 child was lost to the follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Although symptoms are relatively uncommon. renovascular disease is a frequent cause of severe hypertension in childhood. Non-invasive diagnostic techniques appear useful as screening methods. Treatment by surgery or PTA is successful if patients are carefully selected.",

Although she was weaned from bypass successfully, direct epiaortic ultrasound scanning disclosed the acute luminal narrowing of the ascending aorta at the level of aortic cannulation. The perfusion was restarted through the tube graft anastomosed to the left carotid artery and the ascending aorta was cross-clamped. The longitudinal incision at the site of prior aortic cannulation disclosed the intramural hematoma at the posterior wall of the ascending aorta. The stenosis was repaired with the patch enlargement of the anterior wall. As the dysplastic wall of the ascending aorta in patients with this syndrome may be injured by arterial cannula, an appropriate positioning of the cannula is mandatory to lessen the risk of intimal injury.",

METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively analyzed the data of 15 patients (13 males, mean age 15.5+/-10.18 years) with a diagnosis of supravalvar aortic stenosis confirmed by cardiac catheterization. Five patients had morphological features of Williams' syndrome. One patient had diffuse while the rest had discrete type of supravalvar aortic stenosis. Five patients did not have any associated lesions. A 9-year-old male had an ascending aortic aneurysm, and 3 patients had associated peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis. One child had a subaortic ventricular septal defect, and another had severe mitral regurgitation. Twelve patients had electrocardiographic evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy. Three patients had mild aortic valvar stenosis while 2 had aortic regurgitation. Six patients had dilated coronary arteries. Two patients with supravalvar aortic gradients of 20 and 40 mmHg were kept on close follow-up. One patient was not willing to undergo surgery while the other is awaiting surgery. Eleven patients underwent surgical correction. Dacron or pericardial patch aortoplasty was done in all the patients. In addition, one patient each underwent pulmonary artery plasty, ventricular septal defect closure, repair of ascending aortic aneurysm, and mitral valve replacement. The patient with diffuse type of supravalvar aortic stenosis underwent augmentation aortoplasty. Two patients died perioperatively. One was lost to follow-up. Two had moderate residual gradients. The rest of the patients were in New York Heart Association functional class I on follow-up of 6.3+/-4.7 years. CONCLUSIONS: Repair of supravalvar aortic stenosis by single sinus aortoplasty is safe and produces good results.",

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty children (aged 5 days to 15 years) were studied and treated for RVH during 1977-1998. In 14 cases hypertension was found during a routine examination. Six cases had heart failure and/or hypertensive encephalopathy. Diagnosis was made with aortography. Post-captopril renography and Doppler ultrasonography were obtained in 8 patients and spiral computed tomography angiography in 2. Treatment consisted of surgery (8 patients), percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) (5) or antihypertensive drugs only (8). RESULTS: Initial blood pressure was 62 +/- 31 mmHg > 95th percentile for systolic and 44 +/- 22 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure. Twelve children had unilateral and 8 had bilateral arterial stenosis. In 3 cases lesions were intrarenal. RVH was due to fibromuscular dysplasia (7 patients) and associated to middle aortic syndrome (5). neurofibromatosis (3), William's syndrome (2). Takayasu's arteritis (1) and pheochromocytoma (1). Treatment of choice was decided depending on the size of the child and location and severity of the stenosis. At the end of the follow-up (78 +/- 49 months), 9 patients are normotensive without medication and 7 are normotensive with drugs. Three patients have died, 2 for unrelated causes and I for cardiac failure; 1 child was lost to the follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Although symptoms are relatively uncommon. renovascular disease is a frequent cause of severe hypertension in childhood. Non-invasive diagnostic techniques appear useful as screening methods. Treatment by surgery or PTA is successful if patients are carefully selected.",

This brings up new challenges in all aspects of their care. METHODS: We describe the first report of a small child receiving a simultaneous liver and kidney transplant and abdominal rectus sheath fascia transplant on the background of Williams syndrome and methylmalonic acidaemia. At the time of transplantation, the child was 3 years old, weighed 14.0 kg, had chronic kidney disease stage V, and had not yet started any other form of kidney replacement therapy. RESULTS: There were many anaesthetic, medical, metabolic, and surgical challenges to consider in this case. A long general anaesthetic time increased the risk of cardiac complications and metabolic decompensation. Additionally, the small size of the patient and the organ size mis-match meant that primary abdominal closure was not possible. The patient's recovery was further complicated by sepsis, transient CNI toxicity, and de novo DSAs. CONCLUSIONS: Through a multidisciplinary approach between 9 specialties in 4 hospitals across England and Wales, and detailed pre-operative planning, a good outcome was achieved for this child. An hour by hour management protocol was drafted to facilitate transplant and included five domains: 1. management at the time of organ offer; 2. before the admission; 3. at admission and before theatre time; 4. intra-operative management; and 5. post-operative management in the first 24 h. Importantly, gaining a clear and in depth understanding of the metabolic state of the patient pre- and peri-operatively was crucial in avoiding metabolic decompensation. Furthermore, an abdominal rectus sheath fascia transplant was required to achieve abdominal closure, which to our knowledge, had never been done before for this indication. Using our experience of this complex case, as well as our experience in transplanting other children with MMA, and through a literature review, we propose a new perioperative management pathway for this complex cohort of transplant recipients.",

We sought to investigate the effect of the degree of pulmonary arterial stenosis on the prognosis after an operation for supravalvular aortic stenosis to help define the optimal treatment strategy for patients with severe forms of elastin arteriopathy. METHODS: Between 1960 and 1999, 33 patients underwent operations for supravalvular aortic stenosis while having significant stenoses of the pulmonary arteries. We retrospectively reviewed patient charts, obtained current follow-up information, and determined risk factors for survival and reoperation. RESULTS: Fifteen patients with moderate right-sided obstructions (confirmed by pulmonary artery Z-scores and right ventricular/descending aortic pressure ratio) underwent operations for supravalvular aortic stenosis only. Eighteen patients had more severe right-sided obstructions and underwent surgical relief of pulmonary arterial stenoses or right ventricular outflow tract obstruction in addition to operations for supravalvular aortic stenosis. Eight patients had undergone preoperative balloon dilations of stenotic pulmonary arteries. There were 6 early deaths and 1 late death in our series. Survival at 10 and 20 years was 76% (70% confidence interval, 68%-84%) and freedom from reintervention was 59% (70% confidence interval, 46%-71%) at 10 years and 49% (70% confidence interval, 35%-62%) at 20 years. Multivariate analysis revealed that patients with a right ventricular/descending aortic pressure ratio of 1.0 or more were at higher risk for reintervention but not for death. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical treatment of pulmonary artery obstructions in elastin arteriopathy is palliative but, in conjunction with balloon dilation of peripheral pulmonary arteries, offers good long-term survival to patients with the severest form of elastin arteriopathy.",

Here we present the case of a child with Williams syndrome, scoliosis, and a thoracolumbar syrinx that was successfully treated surgically. We recommend that children with Williams syndrome and scoliosis undergo preoperative evaluation of the spinal cord, as well as the spinal column, so that correctable lesions such as a syrinx are not overlooked. Although syrinxes are often associated with scoliosis, the association in this case of syrinx and Williams syndrome could imply the existence of a genetic contribution to syrinx formation on chromosome 7.",

Generally, difficult airway is expected in patients with Williams syndrome by characteristic face. A 26-year-old female with Williams syndrome was scheduled for abdominal myomectomy under general anesthesia. Difficult mask ventilation and tracheal intubation were anticipated because of micrognathia, mandibular retrusion, and a Mallanpati class III airway. Before induction of anesthesia the patient breathed 100% oxygen for 3 minutes. Anesthesia was induced and maintained with propofol, remifentanil and rocuronium bromide. Mask ventilation was easily performed. The direct laryngoscopic view was Cormack grade I and there was no difficulty in the tracheal intubation. After induction of anesthesia, anesthetic course was uneventful. According to the most previous clinical reports in patients with Williams syndrome in Japan, mask ventilation and tracheal intubation were performed easily contrary to preoperative airway assessment. In view of SAS, mental retardation, airway deformity and airway assessment in previous clinical reports, we should select the optimal strategy for airway management in patients with Williams syndrome.",

The diagnosis was challenging due to a complex cardiac history, gastroesophageal reflux, and normal interictal EEG findings. This case highlights the importance of prolonged EEG monitoring in suspected cases of apnoeic seizures. Further, given the reported cases of unexplained sudden death in Williams-Beuren syndrome, this case raises the possibility of an association between apnoeic seizures and unexplained sudden death.

METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively analyzed the data of 15 patients (13 males, mean age 15.5+/-10.18 years) with a diagnosis of supravalvar aortic stenosis confirmed by cardiac catheterization. Five patients had morphological features of Williams' syndrome. One patient had diffuse while the rest had discrete type of supravalvar aortic stenosis. Five patients did not have any associated lesions. A 9-year-old male had an ascending aortic aneurysm, and 3 patients had associated peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis. One child had a subaortic ventricular septal defect, and another had severe mitral regurgitation. Twelve patients had electrocardiographic evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy. Three patients had mild aortic valvar stenosis while 2 had aortic regurgitation. Six patients had dilated coronary arteries. Two patients with supravalvar aortic gradients of 20 and 40 mmHg were kept on close follow-up. One patient was not willing to undergo surgery while the other is awaiting surgery. Eleven patients underwent surgical correction. Dacron or pericardial patch aortoplasty was done in all the patients. In addition, one patient each underwent pulmonary artery plasty, ventricular septal defect closure, repair of ascending aortic aneurysm, and mitral valve replacement. The patient with diffuse type of supravalvar aortic stenosis underwent augmentation aortoplasty. Two patients died perioperatively. One was lost to follow-up. Two had moderate residual gradients. The rest of the patients were in New York Heart Association functional class I on follow-up of 6.3+/-4.7 years. CONCLUSIONS: Repair of supravalvar aortic stenosis by single sinus aortoplasty is safe and produces good results.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Controversy remains regarding the optimal surgical approach for children with supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS). METHODS: Since 1997 we have used Brom three-patch aortoplasty for patients with SVAS. We prefer computed tomography (CT) imaging for preoperative evaluation rather than cardiac catheterization as it avoids the well-known morbidity of general anesthesia. The purpose of this study was to present our intermediate-term results of this strategy. RESULTS: Twenty consecutive patients with SVAS were treated with Brom aortoplasty. Mean age was 3.7 +- 5.9 years (median, 1.5 years). Twelve patients had Williams syndrome. Ten patients had preoperative advanced medical imaging (seven CT, three magnetic resonance imaging) and did not have cardiac catheterization. Mean times for cardiopulmonary bypass and cross-clamp were 172 +- 29 minutes and 110 +- 21 minutes, respectively. Ten patients had simultaneous pulmonary artery stenosis patching. Median length of stay was seven days. There was no operative or late mortality. Mean follow-up was 6 +- 5 years. There were no reoperations on the aortic root. Fifteen patients had mild or less aortic insufficiency (AI) and two had moderate AI. One patient who had infant balloon dilation of the aortic valve and postoperative subacute bacterial endocarditis had moderate-to-severe AI and aortic stenosis (AS). One patient had moderate residual SVAS; all others had no AS. No patients had late coronary insufficiency. CONCLUSION: Brom aortoplasty promotes restoration of normal aortic root geometry and relief of coronary ostial stenosis, which is important in preventing myocardial ischemia. Computed tomography imaging is our preferred diagnostic modality. Intermediate-term outcomes are excellent with no recurrent SVAS, coronary events, or reoperations on the aortic valve.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hyperacusis and phonophobia are common, debilitating symptoms in Williams syndrome (WS), yet little is known about their underlying audiologic and neurologic processes. METHODS: The mothers of 49 subjects with WS were asked to complete the Hyperacusis Screening Questionnaire. Subjects with reported hyperacusis and sufficient developmental capacity underwent comprehensive audiological and brain auditory evoked response (BAER) testing. Findings were compared with those from pair-matched typically developing control subjects. RESULTS: Forty-one of the 49 children with WS (84%) had hyperacusis of moderate to severe degree, which began in infancy. Of these, 21 (mean age 15.8 +/- 5.5 years) were quantitatively tested. Subjects with WS reported discomfort at sound intensities on average 20 dB lower than control subjects. Pure-tone audiometry and distortion products otoacoustic emission test revealed a high-frequency cochlear hearing loss. An absence of ipsilateral acoustic reflex responses to maximum stimulation was significantly more common in the subjects with WS than controls. On BAER testing, the WS group had a significant prolongation in wave I latency. CONCLUSIONS: Hyperacusis in Williams syndrome (WS) is associated with a high-frequency hearing loss resembling the configuration of noise-induced hearing loss. The hyperacusis and hearing loss in WS may stem from a deficiency in the acoustic reflex resulting from auditory nerve dysfunction. Additional mechanisms that may mediate hyperacusis in WS and should be evaluated in future studies include recruitment, malformation of the facial canal, and haploinsufficiency of the elastin gene.",

The technique of symmetric aortoplasty with 3 patches (1 in each sinus) is described and compared with other methods. METHODS: Case reports were reviewed and follow-up was completed by contacting the patient's (pediatric) cardiologist. We aimed for a last follow-up visit, including Doppler echocardiographic studies, in a period no more than 12 months earlier than December 1997. Supravalvular aortic stenosis was discrete in 25 and diffuse with involvement of the aortic arch and arch vessels in 4 patients. Additional anomalies were bicuspid aortic valve (n = 5), coarctation (n = 3), ascending aortic aneurysm (n = 1), mitral valve insufficiency (n = 2), pulmonary valvular stenosis (n = 1), and peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis (n = 2). Eleven patients had Williams syndrome and 1 patient had Noonan syndrome. Symmetric aortoplasty with 3 patches (1 in each sinus) was used in 13 patients, whereas other nonsymmetric methods (1, 2, or Y-shaped patches) were used in 16 patients. Mean follow-up was 10.5 years (range: 4 months-36 years). RESULTS: All techniques adequately decreased the pressure gradient. Progression of preoperative aortic valve insufficiency or de novo regurgitation was not observed except in 1 patient in whom the patches inserted were too large. CONCLUSIONS: No difference could be demonstrated in outcome for any surgical technique; however, reconstruction of the aortic root with autologous pericardial patches in each sinus after transection of the aorta has the advantage of symmetry while restoring the normal aortic root anatomy.",

Our objective was to review our experience with stenosis of the thoracic aorta (STA) in these patients. A retrospective review was undertaken of consecutive WS patients at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia from January 1, 1980, through December 31, 2007. WS was diagnosed by an experienced medical geneticist and/or by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Stenosis was diagnosed with either echocardiography or cardiac catheterization. Freedom from intervention was determined using Kaplan-Meier analysis. From a total cohort of 270 patients, 37 (14%) patients with STA were identified and comprised the study group. Age at presentation was 2.1 + or - 4.0 years, and follow-up was 11.8 + or - 12.6 years (range 0-51). Long-segment STA was more common (89%) than discrete STA. Severity of STA was mild in 18, moderate in 10, and severe in 9 patients. Branch pulmonary artery stenosis was seen in 62% (23 of 37) of STA patients, and supravalvar aortic stenosis was seen in 54% (20 of 37) STA patients. Nine (24%) patients underwent intervention for STA: 8 cases were severe, and 1 case was moderate. Restenosis resulting in reintervention occurred in 5 of 9 (56%) patients, with 4 of 5 (80%) patients undergoing multiple reinterventions. Freedom from intervention was 89, 82, and 73% at 1, 5, and 20 years, respectively. One patient died. STA is common in WS and is generally the long-segment type. In patients with STA, interventions are common and usually occur by 5 years of age. Reintervention for STA occurs frequently.",

We present a young patient manifesting all three conditions. This child is a boy with a Williams Syndrome phenotype who was diagnosed with severe chronic kidney disease secondary to bilateral renal dysplasia/hypoplasia. Due to his small size, he received treatment with growth hormone. He progressed to end stage kidney disease and, after 8 months, a renal transplant was performed. A number of suspicious abdominal adenopathies were removed during the surgery and, thereafter, immunosupressive treatment with prednisone, azathioprine and cyclosporine was initiated. Examination of the biopsy tissue confirmed the presence of a T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma. Appropriate chemotherapy was given, and the immunosupressive regimen was eventually reduced to prednisone alone. Now, 8 years since the initial diagnosis of T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma and 6 years after the completion of the chemotherapy, the patient is still in complete remission with a functional donor kidney. We discuss some possible explanations of this association. Chemotherapy has not appeared to have affected the viability of the grafted kidney and, in fact, it may even have induced immunotolerance.",

Atherosclerosis is rare in children, who typically suffer from fibromuscular dysplasia, neurofibromatosis type 1, Williams syndrome, or certain other rare conditions. Children with renovascular disease often have involvement of other arteries including the aorta and mesenteric and cerebral vessels. The pediatric interventional radiology service has a vital role in the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of renovascular hypertension. Renal vein renin sampling appears to be more useful in children than in adults, because their arterial disease is more often bilateral and segmental. Diagnostic angiography is still superior to less-invasive methods of imaging the renal arteries, especially the smaller branches. Interventional options include angioplasty, stenting, and ethanol ablation. Angioplasty is almost always technically successful and usually gives a worthwhile clinical improvement. Stenting is only used in children when angioplasty fails. Ethanol embolization may be appropriate in children with focal renin-producing areas that are untreatable by angioplasty.",

In this review we evaluated mid-term clinical outcomes of these techniques at our institution. METHODS: Our cardiac surgery database identified patients with SVAS repair from 1990 to 2008. Follow-up records, reintervention and reoperation data, and most recent echocardiograms were obtained. RESULTS: From 1990 to 2008, 20 patients (70% male) underwent surgery for SVAS. Mean age was 3.6 +/- 5.6 years. In chronological sequence, 8 patients had single-patch aortoplasty, 4 had the Doty procedure, and 8 received Brom's symmetric three-patch aortoplasty. Of the Brom patients, 6 had Williams syndrome. Aortic cross-clamp times were 40.1 +/- 13.6 minutes (one-patch), 60.3 +/- 38.8 minutes (Doty), and 104 +/- 20.5 minutes (Brom). Perioperative mortality was 5.0% (1 patient in one-patch group). Mean postoperative length of stay was 10 +/- 10.6 days. Follow-up data were available for all survivors (mean follow-up, 6.3 +/- 6.0 years; range, 6 months to 16 years). There were no late deaths. Follow-up echocardiograms revealed a peak Doppler gradient across the aortic outflow tract of 33 +/- 18.0 mm Hg (one-patch), 10 +/- 1 mm Hg (Doty), and 18 +/- 12 mm Hg (Brom). All patients in the Doty and Brom groups had less than moderate aortic insufficiency. Reoperations were required in 5 of 8 one-patch patients (62%) for residual aortic stenosis (n = 3), aortic insufficiency (n = 1), and subvalvar stenosis (n = 1). No Doty or Brom patient has required aortic reoperations, which was nearly statistically associated with freedom from reoperation (p = 0.06). Subvalvar stenosis was the only risk factor associated with reoperation (p = 0.0028). CONCLUSIONS: Despite a longer cross-clamp time, SVAS repair by Doty or Brom aortoplasty restores normal hemodynamics and reduces the need for reoperation when compared with the classic one-patch technique.

A retrospective analysis was carried out on 20 patients operated in the years 1980-1999. The group included 12 boys and 8 girls aged 0.9 to 14.5 years (mean 7.8 +/- 3.4 years). The diagnosis of Williams syndrome in 6 children (30%) was based on the typical face. The mean systolic pressure gradient across the SAS was 84.3 +/- 34.5 mmHg (range from 41 to 168 mmHg). Intraoperative studies allowed to determine that 16 (80%) children had the hourglass type, 2 (10%) tubular type and 2 (10%)--fibromuscular membrane type of stenosis. Sixteen (80%) children had anomalies of the aortic valve and/or coronary arteries, and in 13 (56%) children associated heart or great vessels anomalies were noted. All the patients were operated on using cardiopulmonary bypass and hypothermia. The associated anomalies were corrected simultaneously. There were no early and late deaths. Because of restenosis one child was reoperated. In the follow up the mean systolic pressure gradient between the left ventricle and ascending aorta revealed by echocardiography in 19 (95%) children to be 8 +/- 2 mmHg (range from 0 to 28 mmHg). Eighteen children are now in NYHA class I (New York Heart Association) and develop normally. Supravalvular aortic stenosis is a rare complex anomaly, which, because of life-threatening complications and low operative risk, should be fully repaired as soon as possible.",

Follow-up data were available for all survivors (mean follow-up, 6.3 +/- 6.0 years; range, 6 months to 16 years). There were no late deaths. Follow-up echocardiograms revealed a peak Doppler gradient across the aortic outflow tract of 33 +/- 18.0 mm Hg (one-patch), 10 +/- 1 mm Hg (Doty), and 18 +/- 12 mm Hg (Brom). All patients in the Doty and Brom groups had less than moderate aortic insufficiency. Reoperations were required in 5 of 8 one-patch patients (62%) for residual aortic stenosis (n = 3), aortic insufficiency (n = 1), and subvalvar stenosis (n = 1). No Doty or Brom patient has required aortic reoperations, which was nearly statistically associated with freedom from reoperation (p = 0.06). Subvalvar stenosis was the only risk factor associated with reoperation (p = 0.0028). CONCLUSIONS: Despite a longer cross-clamp time, SVAS repair by Doty or Brom aortoplasty restores normal hemodynamics and reduces the need for reoperation when compared with the classic one-patch technique. Our current preference for SVAS repair is the Brom three-patch symmetric aortoplasty.",

METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively analyzed the data of 15 patients (13 males, mean age 15.5+/-10.18 years) with a diagnosis of supravalvar aortic stenosis confirmed by cardiac catheterization. Five patients had morphological features of Williams' syndrome. One patient had diffuse while the rest had discrete type of supravalvar aortic stenosis. Five patients did not have any associated lesions. A 9-year-old male had an ascending aortic aneurysm, and 3 patients had associated peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis. One child had a subaortic ventricular septal defect, and another had severe mitral regurgitation. Twelve patients had electrocardiographic evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy. Three patients had mild aortic valvar stenosis while 2 had aortic regurgitation. Six patients had dilated coronary arteries. Two patients with supravalvar aortic gradients of 20 and 40 mmHg were kept on close follow-up. One patient was not willing to undergo surgery while the other is awaiting surgery. Eleven patients underwent surgical correction. Dacron or pericardial patch aortoplasty was done in all the patients. In addition, one patient each underwent pulmonary artery plasty, ventricular septal defect closure, repair of ascending aortic aneurysm, and mitral valve replacement. The patient with diffuse type of supravalvar aortic stenosis underwent augmentation aortoplasty. Two patients died perioperatively. One was lost to follow-up. Two had moderate residual gradients. The rest of the patients were in New York Heart Association functional class I on follow-up of 6.3+/-4.7 years. CONCLUSIONS: Repair of supravalvar aortic stenosis by single sinus aortoplasty is safe and produces good results.",

The perfusion was restarted through the tube graft anastomosed to the left carotid artery and the ascending aorta was cross-clamped. The longitudinal incision at the site of prior aortic cannulation disclosed the intramural hematoma at the posterior wall of the ascending aorta. The stenosis was repaired with the patch enlargement of the anterior wall.

The technique of symmetric aortoplasty with 3 patches (1 in each sinus) is described and compared with other methods. METHODS: Case reports were reviewed and follow-up was completed by contacting the patient's (pediatric) cardiologist. We aimed for a last follow-up visit, including Doppler echocardiographic studies, in a period no more than 12 months earlier than December 1997. Supravalvular aortic stenosis was discrete in 25 and diffuse with involvement of the aortic arch and arch vessels in 4 patients. Additional anomalies were bicuspid aortic valve (n = 5), coarctation (n = 3), ascending aortic aneurysm (n = 1), mitral valve insufficiency (n = 2), pulmonary valvular stenosis (n = 1), and peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis (n = 2). Eleven patients had Williams syndrome and 1 patient had Noonan syndrome. Symmetric aortoplasty with 3 patches (1 in each sinus) was used in 13 patients, whereas other nonsymmetric methods (1, 2, or Y-shaped patches) were used in 16 patients. Mean follow-up was 10.5 years (range: 4 months-36 years). RESULTS: All techniques adequately decreased the pressure gradient. Progression of preoperative aortic valve insufficiency or de novo regurgitation was not observed except in 1 patient in whom the patches inserted were too large. CONCLUSIONS: No difference could be demonstrated in outcome for any surgical technique; however, reconstruction of the aortic root with autologous pericardial patches in each sinus after transection of the aorta has the advantage of symmetry while restoring the normal aortic root anatomy.",

                    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Williams syndrome (WS) cases have been reported to have with 25-100 times greater increased risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD). SCD has been reported in cases without any evidence of structural cardiovascular anomalies. Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is characterized by short PR interval and delta wave. Ventricular preexcitations can develop paroxysmal reentrant tachycardia through Kent bundle or less frequent atrial fibrillation and in some cases with accessory pathway effective refractory period (APERP) under 250 ms considered as risky and may lead to SCD. WS associated with WPW has not been reported before. CASE REPORT: An 11-year-old male who had been followed up with WS was referred to pediatric cardiology outpatient clinic with the complaint of palpitation. Electrocardiographic examination showed short PR interval and delta wave in the ECG consistent with WPW. He underwent electrophysiological study (EPS). Basic measurements were performed, and APERP was found at 280 ms cycle atrial pacing. RF energy was delivered using a 4 mm tip nonirrigated radiofrequency (RF) ablation catheter where the best ventriculoatrial (VA) signals were received and the AP was abolished within few seconds. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Although, WPW cases are usually asymptomatic or related to SVT, the risk of SCD should not be ignored. Thus, all patients with WPW deserve an EPS for assessing the AP conduction properties. Due to the increased risk of SCD in patients with WS compared to general population, in the presence of concomitant WPW, these patients should be evaluated with EPS even if they do not have symptoms.",

                    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Williams syndrome (WS) cases have been reported to have with 25-100 times greater increased risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD). SCD has been reported in cases without any evidence of structural cardiovascular anomalies. Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is characterized by short PR interval and delta wave. Ventricular preexcitations can develop paroxysmal reentrant tachycardia through Kent bundle or less frequent atrial fibrillation and in some cases with accessory pathway effective refractory period (APERP) under 250 ms considered as risky and may lead to SCD. WS associated with WPW has not been reported before. CASE REPORT: An 11-year-old male who had been followed up with WS was referred to pediatric cardiology outpatient clinic with the complaint of palpitation. Electrocardiographic examination showed short PR interval and delta wave in the ECG consistent with WPW. He underwent electrophysiological study (EPS). Basic measurements were performed, and APERP was found at 280 ms cycle atrial pacing. RF energy was delivered using a 4 mm tip nonirrigated radiofrequency (RF) ablation catheter where the best ventriculoatrial (VA) signals were received and the AP was abolished within few seconds. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Although, WPW cases are usually asymptomatic or related to SVT, the risk of SCD should not be ignored. Thus, all patients with WPW deserve an EPS for assessing the AP conduction properties. Due to the increased risk of SCD in patients with WS compared to general population, in the presence of concomitant WPW, these patients should be evaluated with EPS even if they do not have symptoms.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) represents a heterogeneous group, including Williams syndrome, familial elastin arteriopathy, sporadic cases, and others. This study sought to evaluate long-term outcomes of SVAS repair. METHODS: A total of 87 patients underwent surgical repair of congenital SVAS at Boston Children's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, between 1997 and 2017. A total of 41 patients had Williams syndrome, and 46 did not. Of the 46 patients who did not have Williams syndrome, 23 had sporadic SVAS, and 13 had familial elastin arteriopathy. Demographic data and outcomes were reviewed and analyzed from medical records. RESULTS: The median age at operation was 2.9 years. Mean z score of the sinotubular junction was -3.29 +- 1.42 and of the aortic root was -0.09 +- 1.19. A total of 26% (n = 22) patients had coronary ostium stenosis, and 41% (n = 9) of them required patch plasty. Survival rates at 5, 10, and 20 years were all 94.3%. Freedom from left ventricular outflow tract reoperation at 5, 10, and 20 years was 78.5%, 70.3%, and 70.3%, respectively. Freedom from aortic arch reintervention at 5, 10, and 20 years was 98.6%, 94.3%, 89.3%, respectively. In risk factors analysis, age younger than 1 year, z scores of the aortic valve and aortic root, and concomitant right ventricular outflow tract surgical repair were predictive of the need for reoperation and reintervention for left or right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. CONCLUSIONS: Excellent long-term survival rates can be achieved with surgical repair of SVAS. Age younger than 1 year, small aortic valve and aortic root z scores, and concomitant right ventricular outflow tract surgical repair were predictors of reoperation and reintervention.",

This brings up new challenges in all aspects of their care. METHODS: We describe the first report of a small child receiving a simultaneous liver and kidney transplant and abdominal rectus sheath fascia transplant on the background of Williams syndrome and methylmalonic acidaemia. At the time of transplantation, the child was 3 years old, weighed 14.0 kg, had chronic kidney disease stage V, and had not yet started any other form of kidney replacement therapy. RESULTS: There were many anaesthetic, medical, metabolic, and surgical challenges to consider in this case. A long general anaesthetic time increased the risk of cardiac complications and metabolic decompensation. Additionally, the small size of the patient and the organ size mis-match meant that primary abdominal closure was not possible. The patient's recovery was further complicated by sepsis, transient CNI toxicity, and de novo DSAs. CONCLUSIONS: Through a multidisciplinary approach between 9 specialties in 4 hospitals across England and Wales, and detailed pre-operative planning, a good outcome was achieved for this child. An hour by hour management protocol was drafted to facilitate transplant and included five domains: 1. management at the time of organ offer; 2. before the admission; 3. at admission and before theatre time; 4. intra-operative management; and 5. post-operative management in the first 24 h. Importantly, gaining a clear and in depth understanding of the metabolic state of the patient pre- and peri-operatively was crucial in avoiding metabolic decompensation. Furthermore, an abdominal rectus sheath fascia transplant was required to achieve abdominal closure, which to our knowledge, had never been done before for this indication. Using our experience of this complex case, as well as our experience in transplanting other children with MMA, and through a literature review, we propose a new perioperative management pathway for this complex cohort of transplant recipients.",

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty children (aged 5 days to 15 years) were studied and treated for RVH during 1977-1998. In 14 cases hypertension was found during a routine examination. Six cases had heart failure and/or hypertensive encephalopathy. Diagnosis was made with aortography. Post-captopril renography and Doppler ultrasonography were obtained in 8 patients and spiral computed tomography angiography in 2. Treatment consisted of surgery (8 patients), percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) (5) or antihypertensive drugs only (8). RESULTS: Initial blood pressure was 62 +/- 31 mmHg > 95th percentile for systolic and 44 +/- 22 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure. Twelve children had unilateral and 8 had bilateral arterial stenosis. In 3 cases lesions were intrarenal. RVH was due to fibromuscular dysplasia (7 patients) and associated to middle aortic syndrome (5). neurofibromatosis (3), William's syndrome (2). Takayasu's arteritis (1) and pheochromocytoma (1). Treatment of choice was decided depending on the size of the child and location and severity of the stenosis. At the end of the follow-up (78 +/- 49 months), 9 patients are normotensive without medication and 7 are normotensive with drugs. Three patients have died, 2 for unrelated causes and I for cardiac failure; 1 child was lost to the follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Although symptoms are relatively uncommon. renovascular disease is a frequent cause of severe hypertension in childhood. Non-invasive diagnostic techniques appear useful as screening methods. Treatment by surgery or PTA is successful if patients are carefully selected.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Angioplasty and stent implantation have become accepted therapies for isolated peripheral pulmonary stenosis, and have been shown to increase vessel diameter and reduce right ventricular (RV) pressure acutely in patients with pulmonary artery (PA) stenosis. The purpose of this study was to assess long-term outcomes after primary transcatheter therapy for peripheral pulmonary stenosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 69 patients who underwent primary transcatheter intervention for severe isolated peripheral pulmonary stenosis at <= 5 years of age. Genetic/syndromic diagnoses included Williams syndrome (n=23), non-Williams familial arteriopathy (n=12), and Alagille syndrome (n=3). At the initial PA intervention, median RV:aortic pressure ratio decreased from 1.00 to 0.88 (median decrease, 0.18; P<0.001). Patients with a higher preintervention RV:aortic pressure ratio had a greater reduction (P<0.001). During follow-up (median, 8.5 years), 10 patients died, 5 from complications of PA catheterization (all before 1998). Thirteen patients underwent surgical PA intervention, most within 1 year and along with repair of supravalvar aortic stenosis. Freedom from any PA reintervention was 38 +- 6% at 1 year and 22 +- 6% at 5 years. The median RV:aortic pressure ratio decreased from 1.0 at baseline to 0.53 at the most recent catheterization (P<0.001), and 82% of patients with available clinical follow-up were asymptomatic. CONCLUSIONS: Transcatheter therapy for infants with severe peripheral pulmonary stenosis has become safer, regardless of genetic condition. Coupled with reintervention and surgical relief in selected cases, RV:aortic pressure ratios decrease substantially and most patients are asymptomatic at late follow-up.",

BACKGROUND: Abdominal coarctation is a rare condition, accounting for less than 2% of aortic coarctations. Single patients with abdominal coarctation have been reported with additional vascular disease in pediatric patients. METHODS: Our echocardiography database between January 2001 and January 2012 was searched to identify all patients with abdominal coarctation. Relevant clinical data were reviewed. RESULTS: Nine patients were identified with abdominal coarctation. Median age at diagnosis was 4.7 years (IQR 1.1-14.3 years). Additional cardiac diagnoses were found in three patients: one had moderate aortic regurgitation and aortic root dilatation; one had mild aortic regurgitation, severe mitral regurgitation, and atrial flutter; and one had a thoracic coarctation previously repaired. Eight patients (89%) had an associated noncardiac comorbidity. Comorbidities included: Takayasu arteritis (n = 3), systemic lupus erythematosus (n = 1), epidermal nevus syndrome (n = 1), abdominal hemangioma (n = 1), Williams syndrome (n = 1), and renal artery stenosis (n = 2). Intervention was performed in four patients (57%): two underwent surgical grafting and two had angioplasty with stent placement. Patients with surgical grafting required no further intervention, whereas both patients who underwent angioplasty and stenting required further stent placement. CONCLUSION: Abdominal coarctation is a rare anomaly. It is frequently associated with other vascular abnormalities. Vasculitis should be suspected in children with abdominal coarctation. All patients, even if treated, require continued close observation.",

Twenty-one patients aged 6-26 years with a genetically confirmed diagnosis of WS and with reported hyperacusis were compared with 21 normally developing age-matched subjects. The medial olivocochlear (MOC) efferent system was tested by stimulation of the contralateral ear with increasing levels of white noise, while recording transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE) in the ipsilateral ear. The suppression effect on the amplitudes of the TEOAE was computed for each contralateral stimulus level. This measure reflects the strength of the MOC efferent system. In addition, the thresholds of ipsilateral and contralateral acoustic reflexes in response to 1, 2 and 4 kHz tones as well as to broadband stimuli were also recorded. Results showed that patients with WS had a significantly higher suppression effect of the MOC reflex on TEOAE. Ipsilateral and contralateral acoustic reflexes to tonal and broadband stimuli presented at maximum stimulus intensities were absent in 62-86% of the patients with WS. In the remainder, acoustic reflexes were elicited at lower auditory sensation thresholds than in controls. Hyperexcitability of the MOC efferent system coupled with absence of acoustic reflexes may contribute to the hyperacusis in WS and the consequent high-tone hearing loss induced by environmental noise. Both measures can be used for objective detection and thus, intervention of hyperacusis in the early stages of life.",

We sought to investigate the effect of the degree of pulmonary arterial stenosis on the prognosis after an operation for supravalvular aortic stenosis to help define the optimal treatment strategy for patients with severe forms of elastin arteriopathy. METHODS: Between 1960 and 1999, 33 patients underwent operations for supravalvular aortic stenosis while having significant stenoses of the pulmonary arteries. We retrospectively reviewed patient charts, obtained current follow-up information, and determined risk factors for survival and reoperation. RESULTS: Fifteen patients with moderate right-sided obstructions (confirmed by pulmonary artery Z-scores and right ventricular/descending aortic pressure ratio) underwent operations for supravalvular aortic stenosis only. Eighteen patients had more severe right-sided obstructions and underwent surgical relief of pulmonary arterial stenoses or right ventricular outflow tract obstruction in addition to operations for supravalvular aortic stenosis. Eight patients had undergone preoperative balloon dilations of stenotic pulmonary arteries. There were 6 early deaths and 1 late death in our series. Survival at 10 and 20 years was 76% (70% confidence interval, 68%-84%) and freedom from reintervention was 59% (70% confidence interval, 46%-71%) at 10 years and 49% (70% confidence interval, 35%-62%) at 20 years. Multivariate analysis revealed that patients with a right ventricular/descending aortic pressure ratio of 1.0 or more were at higher risk for reintervention but not for death. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical treatment of pulmonary artery obstructions in elastin arteriopathy is palliative but, in conjunction with balloon dilation of peripheral pulmonary arteries, offers good long-term survival to patients with the severest form of elastin arteriopathy.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: A number of patients with Williams syndrome or other forms of elastin arteriopathy have stenoses of pulmonary arteries in addition to supravalvular aortic stenosis. We sought to investigate the effect of the degree of pulmonary arterial stenosis on the prognosis after an operation for supravalvular aortic stenosis to help define the optimal treatment strategy for patients with severe forms of elastin arteriopathy. METHODS: Between 1960 and 1999, 33 patients underwent operations for supravalvular aortic stenosis while having significant stenoses of the pulmonary arteries. We retrospectively reviewed patient charts, obtained current follow-up information, and determined risk factors for survival and reoperation. RESULTS: Fifteen patients with moderate right-sided obstructions (confirmed by pulmonary artery Z-scores and right ventricular/descending aortic pressure ratio) underwent operations for supravalvular aortic stenosis only. Eighteen patients had more severe right-sided obstructions and underwent surgical relief of pulmonary arterial stenoses or right ventricular outflow tract obstruction in addition to operations for supravalvular aortic stenosis. Eight patients had undergone preoperative balloon dilations of stenotic pulmonary arteries. There were 6 early deaths and 1 late death in our series. Survival at 10 and 20 years was 76% (70% confidence interval, 68%-84%) and freedom from reintervention was 59% (70% confidence interval, 46%-71%) at 10 years and 49% (70% confidence interval, 35%-62%) at 20 years. Multivariate analysis revealed that patients with a right ventricular/descending aortic pressure ratio of 1.0 or more were at higher risk for reintervention but not for death. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical treatment of pulmonary artery obstructions in elastin arteriopathy is palliative but, in conjunction with balloon dilation of peripheral pulmonary arteries, offers good long-term survival to patients with the severest form of elastin arteriopathy.",

BACKGROUND: Abdominal coarctation is a rare condition, accounting for less than 2% of aortic coarctations. Single patients with abdominal coarctation have been reported with additional vascular disease in pediatric patients. METHODS: Our echocardiography database between January 2001 and January 2012 was searched to identify all patients with abdominal coarctation. Relevant clinical data were reviewed. RESULTS: Nine patients were identified with abdominal coarctation. Median age at diagnosis was 4.7 years (IQR 1.1-14.3 years). Additional cardiac diagnoses were found in three patients: one had moderate aortic regurgitation and aortic root dilatation; one had mild aortic regurgitation, severe mitral regurgitation, and atrial flutter; and one had a thoracic coarctation previously repaired. Eight patients (89%) had an associated noncardiac comorbidity. Comorbidities included: Takayasu arteritis (n = 3), systemic lupus erythematosus (n = 1), epidermal nevus syndrome (n = 1), abdominal hemangioma (n = 1), Williams syndrome (n = 1), and renal artery stenosis (n = 2). Intervention was performed in four patients (57%): two underwent surgical grafting and two had angioplasty with stent placement. Patients with surgical grafting required no further intervention, whereas both patients who underwent angioplasty and stenting required further stent placement. CONCLUSION: Abdominal coarctation is a rare anomaly. It is frequently associated with other vascular abnormalities. Vasculitis should be suspected in children with abdominal coarctation. All patients, even if treated, require continued close observation.",

Four examples of use of PCCC data to evaluate variability in morphology, management, and outcomes for the procedures are described. Consideration is given to the following clinical problems: (1) the experience with surgical heart block in operative closure of perimembranous VSD, (2) the transition away from atrial baffle operations to the arterial switch operation for simple transposition of the great arteries, (3) the experience of planned 3 stage palliation of hypoplastic left heart syndrome, and (4) the identification of a high risk combination of cardiovascular anomalies in Williams syndrome. Analysis of registry outcomes allows ongoing quality improvement at a cardiac center to consider not only its own experience but that of the overall group. The PCCC data can be used to personalize management of rare congenital cardiac anomalies and combinations of anomalies. The PCCC registry allows longitudinal consideration of issues such as staged repairs and incidence of unplanned reoperation. In future years, the PCCC can facilitate investigations into the etiology of congenital heart disease.",

Cardiovascular abnormalities, because of elastin deficiency, are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with Williams syndrome. The present article presents a review of the most recent developments regarding the cardiovascular issues in Williams syndrome. RECENT FINDINGS: Cardiovascular abnormalities occur in 80% of patients with Williams syndrome, the majority of which are arterial stenoses. The stenoses seen in Williams syndrome now appear to arise from deficient circumferential arterial growth. Pharmacological therapies aimed at improving the vascular stenoses have shown some promise in animal models. Surgical outcomes for supravalvar aortic stenosis are good at most centers. Transcatheter interventions are largely ineffective in Williams syndrome. Multilevel surgical pulmonary artery reconstruction has excellent results for peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis. Periprocedural risk stratification and management algorithms may decrease the risk of cardiovascular complications. SUMMARY: Cardiovascular abnormalities are a major determining factor in the clinical picture and trajectory of patients with Williams syndrome. Advances in surgical techniques, medical therapeutic options, and periprocedural management hold promise for significant improvements in the cardiovascular outcomes of these patients.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: A number of patients with Williams syndrome or other forms of elastin arteriopathy have stenoses of pulmonary arteries in addition to supravalvular aortic stenosis. We sought to investigate the effect of the degree of pulmonary arterial stenosis on the prognosis after an operation for supravalvular aortic stenosis to help define the optimal treatment strategy for patients with severe forms of elastin arteriopathy. METHODS: Between 1960 and 1999, 33 patients underwent operations for supravalvular aortic stenosis while having significant stenoses of the pulmonary arteries. We retrospectively reviewed patient charts, obtained current follow-up information, and determined risk factors for survival and reoperation. RESULTS: Fifteen patients with moderate right-sided obstructions (confirmed by pulmonary artery Z-scores and right ventricular/descending aortic pressure ratio) underwent operations for supravalvular aortic stenosis only. Eighteen patients had more severe right-sided obstructions and underwent surgical relief of pulmonary arterial stenoses or right ventricular outflow tract obstruction in addition to operations for supravalvular aortic stenosis. Eight patients had undergone preoperative balloon dilations of stenotic pulmonary arteries. There were 6 early deaths and 1 late death in our series. Survival at 10 and 20 years was 76% (70% confidence interval, 68%-84%) and freedom from reintervention was 59% (70% confidence interval, 46%-71%) at 10 years and 49% (70% confidence interval, 35%-62%) at 20 years. Multivariate analysis revealed that patients with a right ventricular/descending aortic pressure ratio of 1.0 or more were at higher risk for reintervention but not for death. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical treatment of pulmonary artery obstructions in elastin arteriopathy is palliative but, in conjunction with balloon dilation of peripheral pulmonary arteries, offers good long-term survival to patients with the severest form of elastin arteriopathy.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) represents a heterogeneous group, including Williams syndrome, familial elastin arteriopathy, sporadic cases, and others. This study sought to evaluate long-term outcomes of SVAS repair. METHODS: A total of 87 patients underwent surgical repair of congenital SVAS at Boston Children's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, between 1997 and 2017. A total of 41 patients had Williams syndrome, and 46 did not. Of the 46 patients who did not have Williams syndrome, 23 had sporadic SVAS, and 13 had familial elastin arteriopathy. Demographic data and outcomes were reviewed and analyzed from medical records. RESULTS: The median age at operation was 2.9 years. Mean z score of the sinotubular junction was -3.29 +- 1.42 and of the aortic root was -0.09 +- 1.19. A total of 26% (n = 22) patients had coronary ostium stenosis, and 41% (n = 9) of them required patch plasty. Survival rates at 5, 10, and 20 years were all 94.3%. Freedom from left ventricular outflow tract reoperation at 5, 10, and 20 years was 78.5%, 70.3%, and 70.3%, respectively. Freedom from aortic arch reintervention at 5, 10, and 20 years was 98.6%, 94.3%, 89.3%, respectively. In risk factors analysis, age younger than 1 year, z scores of the aortic valve and aortic root, and concomitant right ventricular outflow tract surgical repair were predictive of the need for reoperation and reintervention for left or right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. CONCLUSIONS: Excellent long-term survival rates can be achieved with surgical repair of SVAS. Age younger than 1 year, small aortic valve and aortic root z scores, and concomitant right ventricular outflow tract surgical repair were predictors of reoperation and reintervention.",

It sometimes displays otorhinolaryngological symptoms because of the relatively high incidence of secretory otitis media and hyperacusis, which may be present in up to 95% of patients. The present paper describes a case of WS associated with bilateral conductive hearing loss which was not related to secretory otitis media. Hyperacusis was, moreover, present in spite of the conductive deafness. Surgical or prosthetic treatment of hearing loss was delayed because of hyperacusis. Treatment of the hyperacusis by acoustic training, instead, yielded excellent, long-lasting remission of the symptoms.",

METHODS: We studied the clinical outcomes of 37 children aged 8 days to 15 years (median 26 months), who underwent aortic arch reconstruction for arch hypoplasia from 1982 to 1997. The children were divided into three groups: Group 1 (20 patients) had isolated aortic arch lesions, Group 2 (13 patients) had associated intra-cardiac pathology yet conserving a biventricular physiology, Group 3 (4 patients) had Williams Syndrome. Previous interventions for coarctation had been performed in 30 patients (81%). Arch repair consisted of a patch aortoplasty in the majority of patients (35 of 37 children). RESULTS: Operative mortality occurred in 5 children, 4 in Group 2 (31%), 1 in Group 3 (25%) and none in Group 1. Permanent neurological complications occurred in 2 children (5 %). During the follow-up, which ranged from 1 month to 8 years, balloon angioplasty for arch obstruction was required in 1 child. There was one late death, associated with a subsequent intra-cardiac repair. CONCLUSIONS: Aortic arch surgery in children with isolated arch hypoplasia, is associated with excellent early and late survival in addition to a low reintervention rate. Alternative perfusion and operative strategies must be implemented in infants with associated intra-cardiac anomalies to improve results.",

Here we present the case of a child with Williams syndrome, scoliosis, and a thoracolumbar syrinx that was successfully treated surgically. We recommend that children with Williams syndrome and scoliosis undergo preoperative evaluation of the spinal cord, as well as the spinal column, so that correctable lesions such as a syrinx are not overlooked. Although syrinxes are often associated with scoliosis, the association in this case of syrinx and Williams syndrome could imply the existence of a genetic contribution to syrinx formation on chromosome 7.",

The technique of symmetric aortoplasty with 3 patches (1 in each sinus) is described and compared with other methods. METHODS: Case reports were reviewed and follow-up was completed by contacting the patient's (pediatric) cardiologist. We aimed for a last follow-up visit, including Doppler echocardiographic studies, in a period no more than 12 months earlier than December 1997. Supravalvular aortic stenosis was discrete in 25 and diffuse with involvement of the aortic arch and arch vessels in 4 patients. Additional anomalies were bicuspid aortic valve (n = 5), coarctation (n = 3), ascending aortic aneurysm (n = 1), mitral valve insufficiency (n = 2), pulmonary valvular stenosis (n = 1), and peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis (n = 2). Eleven patients had Williams syndrome and 1 patient had Noonan syndrome. Symmetric aortoplasty with 3 patches (1 in each sinus) was used in 13 patients, whereas other nonsymmetric methods (1, 2, or Y-shaped patches) were used in 16 patients. Mean follow-up was 10.5 years (range: 4 months-36 years). RESULTS: All techniques adequately decreased the pressure gradient. Progression of preoperative aortic valve insufficiency or de novo regurgitation was not observed except in 1 patient in whom the patches inserted were too large. CONCLUSIONS: No difference could be demonstrated in outcome for any surgical technique; however, reconstruction of the aortic root with autologous pericardial patches in each sinus after transection of the aorta has the advantage of symmetry while restoring the normal aortic root anatomy.",

The purpose of this study was to assess long-term outcomes after primary transcatheter therapy for peripheral pulmonary stenosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 69 patients who underwent primary transcatheter intervention for severe isolated peripheral pulmonary stenosis at <= 5 years of age. Genetic/syndromic diagnoses included Williams syndrome (n=23), non-Williams familial arteriopathy (n=12), and Alagille syndrome (n=3). At the initial PA intervention, median RV:aortic pressure ratio decreased from 1.00 to 0.88 (median decrease, 0.18; P<0.001). Patients with a higher preintervention RV:aortic pressure ratio had a greater reduction (P<0.001). During follow-up (median, 8.5 years), 10 patients died, 5 from complications of PA catheterization (all before 1998). Thirteen patients underwent surgical PA intervention, most within 1 year and along with repair of supravalvar aortic stenosis. Freedom from any PA reintervention was 38 +- 6% at 1 year and 22 +- 6% at 5 years. The median RV:aortic pressure ratio decreased from 1.0 at baseline to 0.53 at the most recent catheterization (P<0.001), and 82% of patients with available clinical follow-up were asymptomatic. CONCLUSIONS: Transcatheter therapy for infants with severe peripheral pulmonary stenosis has become safer, regardless of genetic condition. Coupled with reintervention and surgical relief in selected cases, RV:aortic pressure ratios decrease substantially and most patients are asymptomatic at late follow-up.",

The technique of symmetric aortoplasty with 3 patches (1 in each sinus) is described and compared with other methods. METHODS: Case reports were reviewed and follow-up was completed by contacting the patient's (pediatric) cardiologist. We aimed for a last follow-up visit, including Doppler echocardiographic studies, in a period no more than 12 months earlier than December 1997. Supravalvular aortic stenosis was discrete in 25 and diffuse with involvement of the aortic arch and arch vessels in 4 patients. Additional anomalies were bicuspid aortic valve (n = 5), coarctation (n = 3), ascending aortic aneurysm (n = 1), mitral valve insufficiency (n = 2), pulmonary valvular stenosis (n = 1), and peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis (n = 2). Eleven patients had Williams syndrome and 1 patient had Noonan syndrome. Symmetric aortoplasty with 3 patches (1 in each sinus) was used in 13 patients, whereas other nonsymmetric methods (1, 2, or Y-shaped patches) were used in 16 patients. Mean follow-up was 10.5 years (range: 4 months-36 years). RESULTS: All techniques adequately decreased the pressure gradient. Progression of preoperative aortic valve insufficiency or de novo regurgitation was not observed except in 1 patient in whom the patches inserted were too large. CONCLUSIONS: No difference could be demonstrated in outcome for any surgical technique; however, reconstruction of the aortic root with autologous pericardial patches in each sinus after transection of the aorta has the advantage of symmetry while restoring the normal aortic root anatomy.",

METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively analyzed the data of 15 patients (13 males, mean age 15.5+/-10.18 years) with a diagnosis of supravalvar aortic stenosis confirmed by cardiac catheterization. Five patients had morphological features of Williams' syndrome. One patient had diffuse while the rest had discrete type of supravalvar aortic stenosis. Five patients did not have any associated lesions. A 9-year-old male had an ascending aortic aneurysm, and 3 patients had associated peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis. One child had a subaortic ventricular septal defect, and another had severe mitral regurgitation. Twelve patients had electrocardiographic evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy. Three patients had mild aortic valvar stenosis while 2 had aortic regurgitation. Six patients had dilated coronary arteries. Two patients with supravalvar aortic gradients of 20 and 40 mmHg were kept on close follow-up. One patient was not willing to undergo surgery while the other is awaiting surgery. Eleven patients underwent surgical correction. Dacron or pericardial patch aortoplasty was done in all the patients. In addition, one patient each underwent pulmonary artery plasty, ventricular septal defect closure, repair of ascending aortic aneurysm, and mitral valve replacement. The patient with diffuse type of supravalvar aortic stenosis underwent augmentation aortoplasty. Two patients died perioperatively. One was lost to follow-up. Two had moderate residual gradients. The rest of the patients were in New York Heart Association functional class I on follow-up of 6.3+/-4.7 years. CONCLUSIONS: Repair of supravalvar aortic stenosis by single sinus aortoplasty is safe and produces good results.",

Due to its rare occurrence, outcome data for operations and cardiac catheterization are limited. We reviewed data from 242 individuals from the Pediatric Cardiac Care Consortium (PCCC) with Williams syndrome and associated cardiovascular lesions, and their frequency, and assessed their effects on mortality. In the PCCC, from 1984 to 1999 there were approximately 100,000 entries for cardiac procedures, involving more than 62,000 patients. The diagnosis of Williams syndrome was based on clinical features and determined by each site. Most patients were diagnosed with the availability of the FISH probe for region 7q11.23. Using a spreadsheet application, Microsoft Excel, the selected patients were analyzed for various types of cardiac anomalies. The most common cardiovascular lesions and the mortality rate in patients with Williams syndrome were examined. A complete tabulation of all cardiovascular lesions was assembled. There were 292 catheterizations and 143 operations reported to the PCCC. One hundred six patients had both an operation and a catheterization. The three main cardiovascular anomalies were supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS; 169), pulmonary artery stenosis (PAS; 130), and coarctation or aortic arch hypoplasia (Arch; 32). One hundred five patients had a single lesion, 70 with SVAS, 29 with PAS, and 6 with an arch anomaly. Ninety-two had more than one lesion: 80 with SVAS and PAS, 7 with PAS and Arch, and 5 with SVAS and Arch. Seventy individuals have only SVAS, 29 PAS, and 6 Arch alone. There was a total of 15 deaths. The mortality rate was highest in the group with the combination of SVAS and PAS (7 surgical and 5 catheter; 12 of 80 patients [15%]; p = 0.0001, chi(2)). In conclusion, our data represent the largest collection of individuals with Williams syndrome who underwent cardiac catheterization and/or operation. The data suggest that children with Williams syndrome and bilateral outflow tract obstruction have statistically and clinically significantly higher mortality associated with catheterization or operation.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Angioplasty and stent implantation have become accepted therapies for isolated peripheral pulmonary stenosis, and have been shown to increase vessel diameter and reduce right ventricular (RV) pressure acutely in patients with pulmonary artery (PA) stenosis. The purpose of this study was to assess long-term outcomes after primary transcatheter therapy for peripheral pulmonary stenosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 69 patients who underwent primary transcatheter intervention for severe isolated peripheral pulmonary stenosis at <= 5 years of age. Genetic/syndromic diagnoses included Williams syndrome (n=23), non-Williams familial arteriopathy (n=12), and Alagille syndrome (n=3). At the initial PA intervention, median RV:aortic pressure ratio decreased from 1.00 to 0.88 (median decrease, 0.18; P<0.001). Patients with a higher preintervention RV:aortic pressure ratio had a greater reduction (P<0.001). During follow-up (median, 8.5 years), 10 patients died, 5 from complications of PA catheterization (all before 1998). Thirteen patients underwent surgical PA intervention, most within 1 year and along with repair of supravalvar aortic stenosis. Freedom from any PA reintervention was 38 +- 6% at 1 year and 22 +- 6% at 5 years. The median RV:aortic pressure ratio decreased from 1.0 at baseline to 0.53 at the most recent catheterization (P<0.001), and 82% of patients with available clinical follow-up were asymptomatic. CONCLUSIONS: Transcatheter therapy for infants with severe peripheral pulmonary stenosis has become safer, regardless of genetic condition. Coupled with reintervention and surgical relief in selected cases, RV:aortic pressure ratios decrease substantially and most patients are asymptomatic at late follow-up.",

He persistently developed suprasystemic right ventricular (RV) pressure. Angioplasty with a drug-coated balloon (DCB) was performed for in-stent restenosis and to remodel his distal pulmonary vessels bilaterally. This resulted in immediate improvement in the in-stent stenosis and resultant decrease in RV pressure. Follow-up catheterization two months later continued to show long-lasting improvement in the in-stent stenosis. We hypothesize that the anti-proliferative effects of DCBs may be of benefit in the arteriopathy associated with Williams syndrome.

We sought to investigate the effect of the degree of pulmonary arterial stenosis on the prognosis after an operation for supravalvular aortic stenosis to help define the optimal treatment strategy for patients with severe forms of elastin arteriopathy. METHODS: Between 1960 and 1999, 33 patients underwent operations for supravalvular aortic stenosis while having significant stenoses of the pulmonary arteries. We retrospectively reviewed patient charts, obtained current follow-up information, and determined risk factors for survival and reoperation. RESULTS: Fifteen patients with moderate right-sided obstructions (confirmed by pulmonary artery Z-scores and right ventricular/descending aortic pressure ratio) underwent operations for supravalvular aortic stenosis only. Eighteen patients had more severe right-sided obstructions and underwent surgical relief of pulmonary arterial stenoses or right ventricular outflow tract obstruction in addition to operations for supravalvular aortic stenosis. Eight patients had undergone preoperative balloon dilations of stenotic pulmonary arteries. There were 6 early deaths and 1 late death in our series. Survival at 10 and 20 years was 76% (70% confidence interval, 68%-84%) and freedom from reintervention was 59% (70% confidence interval, 46%-71%) at 10 years and 49% (70% confidence interval, 35%-62%) at 20 years. Multivariate analysis revealed that patients with a right ventricular/descending aortic pressure ratio of 1.0 or more were at higher risk for reintervention but not for death. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical treatment of pulmonary artery obstructions in elastin arteriopathy is palliative but, in conjunction with balloon dilation of peripheral pulmonary arteries, offers good long-term survival to patients with the severest form of elastin arteriopathy.",

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty children (aged 5 days to 15 years) were studied and treated for RVH during 1977-1998. In 14 cases hypertension was found during a routine examination. Six cases had heart failure and/or hypertensive encephalopathy. Diagnosis was made with aortography. Post-captopril renography and Doppler ultrasonography were obtained in 8 patients and spiral computed tomography angiography in 2. Treatment consisted of surgery (8 patients), percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) (5) or antihypertensive drugs only (8). RESULTS: Initial blood pressure was 62 +/- 31 mmHg > 95th percentile for systolic and 44 +/- 22 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure. Twelve children had unilateral and 8 had bilateral arterial stenosis. In 3 cases lesions were intrarenal. RVH was due to fibromuscular dysplasia (7 patients) and associated to middle aortic syndrome (5). neurofibromatosis (3), William's syndrome (2). Takayasu's arteritis (1) and pheochromocytoma (1). Treatment of choice was decided depending on the size of the child and location and severity of the stenosis. At the end of the follow-up (78 +/- 49 months), 9 patients are normotensive without medication and 7 are normotensive with drugs. Three patients have died, 2 for unrelated causes and I for cardiac failure; 1 child was lost to the follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Although symptoms are relatively uncommon. renovascular disease is a frequent cause of severe hypertension in childhood. Non-invasive diagnostic techniques appear useful as screening methods. Treatment by surgery or PTA is successful if patients are carefully selected.",

The three main cardiovascular anomalies were supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS; 169), pulmonary artery stenosis (PAS; 130), and coarctation or aortic arch hypoplasia (Arch; 32). One hundred five patients had a single lesion, 70 with SVAS, 29 with PAS, and 6 with an arch anomaly. Ninety-two had more than one lesion: 80 with SVAS and PAS, 7 with PAS and Arch, and 5 with SVAS and Arch. Seventy individuals have only SVAS, 29 PAS, and 6 Arch alone. There was a total of 15 deaths. The mortality rate was highest in the group with the combination of SVAS and PAS (7 surgical and 5 catheter; 12 of 80 patients [15%]; p = 0.0001, chi(2)). In conclusion, our data represent the largest collection of individuals with Williams syndrome who underwent cardiac catheterization and/or operation. The data suggest that children with Williams syndrome and bilateral outflow tract obstruction have statistically and clinically significantly higher mortality associated with catheterization or operation.",

Due to its rare occurrence, outcome data for operations and cardiac catheterization are limited. We reviewed data from 242 individuals from the Pediatric Cardiac Care Consortium (PCCC) with Williams syndrome and associated cardiovascular lesions, and their frequency, and assessed their effects on mortality. In the PCCC, from 1984 to 1999 there were approximately 100,000 entries for cardiac procedures, involving more than 62,000 patients. The diagnosis of Williams syndrome was based on clinical features and determined by each site. Most patients were diagnosed with the availability of the FISH probe for region 7q11.23. Using a spreadsheet application, Microsoft Excel, the selected patients were analyzed for various types of cardiac anomalies. The most common cardiovascular lesions and the mortality rate in patients with Williams syndrome were examined. A complete tabulation of all cardiovascular lesions was assembled. There were 292 catheterizations and 143 operations reported to the PCCC. One hundred six patients had both an operation and a catheterization.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Controversy remains regarding the optimal surgical approach for children with supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS). METHODS: Since 1997 we have used Brom three-patch aortoplasty for patients with SVAS. We prefer computed tomography (CT) imaging for preoperative evaluation rather than cardiac catheterization as it avoids the well-known morbidity of general anesthesia. The purpose of this study was to present our intermediate-term results of this strategy. RESULTS: Twenty consecutive patients with SVAS were treated with Brom aortoplasty. Mean age was 3.7 +- 5.9 years (median, 1.5 years). Twelve patients had Williams syndrome. Ten patients had preoperative advanced medical imaging (seven CT, three magnetic resonance imaging) and did not have cardiac catheterization. Mean times for cardiopulmonary bypass and cross-clamp were 172 +- 29 minutes and 110 +- 21 minutes, respectively. Ten patients had simultaneous pulmonary artery stenosis patching. Median length of stay was seven days. There was no operative or late mortality. Mean follow-up was 6 +- 5 years. There were no reoperations on the aortic root. Fifteen patients had mild or less aortic insufficiency (AI) and two had moderate AI. One patient who had infant balloon dilation of the aortic valve and postoperative subacute bacterial endocarditis had moderate-to-severe AI and aortic stenosis (AS). One patient had moderate residual SVAS; all others had no AS. No patients had late coronary insufficiency. CONCLUSION: Brom aortoplasty promotes restoration of normal aortic root geometry and relief of coronary ostial stenosis, which is important in preventing myocardial ischemia. Computed tomography imaging is our preferred diagnostic modality. Intermediate-term outcomes are excellent with no recurrent SVAS, coronary events, or reoperations on the aortic valve.",

We present a young patient manifesting all three conditions. This child is a boy with a Williams Syndrome phenotype who was diagnosed with severe chronic kidney disease secondary to bilateral renal dysplasia/hypoplasia. Due to his small size, he received treatment with growth hormone. He progressed to end stage kidney disease and, after 8 months, a renal transplant was performed. A number of suspicious abdominal adenopathies were removed during the surgery and, thereafter, immunosupressive treatment with prednisone, azathioprine and cyclosporine was initiated. Examination of the biopsy tissue confirmed the presence of a T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma. Appropriate chemotherapy was given, and the immunosupressive regimen was eventually reduced to prednisone alone. Now, 8 years since the initial diagnosis of T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma and 6 years after the completion of the chemotherapy, the patient is still in complete remission with a functional donor kidney. We discuss some possible explanations of this association. Chemotherapy has not appeared to have affected the viability of the grafted kidney and, in fact, it may even have induced immunotolerance.",

We present a 17-month-old female patient, who had been diagnosed as WS by genetic analysis, admitted to our clinic for the investigation of severe hypercalcemia (4.02 mmol/L). Because the patient did not respond very well to fluid administration, furosemide infusion, and dietary calcium restriction, pamidronate infusion was performed and calcium levels returned to normal within 2 days.

Atherosclerosis is rare in children, who typically suffer from fibromuscular dysplasia, neurofibromatosis type 1, Williams syndrome, or certain other rare conditions. Children with renovascular disease often have involvement of other arteries including the aorta and mesenteric and cerebral vessels. The pediatric interventional radiology service has a vital role in the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of renovascular hypertension. Renal vein renin sampling appears to be more useful in children than in adults, because their arterial disease is more often bilateral and segmental. Diagnostic angiography is still superior to less-invasive methods of imaging the renal arteries, especially the smaller branches. Interventional options include angioplasty, stenting, and ethanol ablation. Angioplasty is almost always technically successful and usually gives a worthwhile clinical improvement. Stenting is only used in children when angioplasty fails. Ethanol embolization may be appropriate in children with focal renin-producing areas that are untreatable by angioplasty.",

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty children (aged 5 days to 15 years) were studied and treated for RVH during 1977-1998. In 14 cases hypertension was found during a routine examination. Six cases had heart failure and/or hypertensive encephalopathy. Diagnosis was made with aortography. Post-captopril renography and Doppler ultrasonography were obtained in 8 patients and spiral computed tomography angiography in 2. Treatment consisted of surgery (8 patients), percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) (5) or antihypertensive drugs only (8). RESULTS: Initial blood pressure was 62 +/- 31 mmHg > 95th percentile for systolic and 44 +/- 22 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure. Twelve children had unilateral and 8 had bilateral arterial stenosis. In 3 cases lesions were intrarenal. RVH was due to fibromuscular dysplasia (7 patients) and associated to middle aortic syndrome (5). neurofibromatosis (3), William's syndrome (2). Takayasu's arteritis (1) and pheochromocytoma (1). Treatment of choice was decided depending on the size of the child and location and severity of the stenosis. At the end of the follow-up (78 +/- 49 months), 9 patients are normotensive without medication and 7 are normotensive with drugs. Three patients have died, 2 for unrelated causes and I for cardiac failure; 1 child was lost to the follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Although symptoms are relatively uncommon. renovascular disease is a frequent cause of severe hypertension in childhood. Non-invasive diagnostic techniques appear useful as screening methods. Treatment by surgery or PTA is successful if patients are carefully selected.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Experience of balloon dilation of peripheral pulmonary stenosis (PPS) in Williams syndrome (WS) is limited. METHODS AND RESULTS: Catheterizations in all patients with WS undergoing therapy for PPS from 1984 to 1999 were reviewed. Criteria for successful dilation included an increase >50% in predilation diameter and a decrease >20% in ratio of right ventricular (RV) to aortic (Ao) systolic pressure. Median age and weight were 1.5 years and 9.5 kg. There were 134 dilations during 39 procedures in 25 patients. The success rate for initial dilations was 51%. In multivariate analysis, successful dilation was more likely (1) in distal than in central pulmonary arteries (P=0.02), (2) if the balloon waist resolved with inflation (P=0.001), and (3) with larger balloon/stenosis ratio (P<0.001). RV pressure was unchanged after dilation (96+/-30 versus 97+/-31 mm Hg), primarily because of failure to enlarge central pulmonary arteries. The Ao pressure increased (102+/-14 versus 109+/-19 mm Hg, P=0.03), and the RV/Ao pressure ratio decreased (0.97+/-0.34 versus 0.91+/-0.30, P=0.05). Aneurysms developed after 24 dilations (18%) and were not related to balloon/stenosis ratio. Balloon rupture in 12 dilations produced an aneurysm in all 7 cases when rupture was in a hypoplastic segment. Three patients died, none from pulmonary artery trauma, and all before 1994. CONCLUSIONS: Mortality occurred early in our experience. Despite successful dilation of distal pulmonary arteries, there was modest initial hemodynamic improvement, mainly because of persistent central pulmonary artery obstruction. A serial approach of distal dilations followed by surgical repair of proximal obstruction may be a rational and successful therapy.",

STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective review was undertaken of consecutive patients with WS at our institution from January 1, 1980, through December 31, 2007. WS was diagnosed by an experienced medical geneticist and/or by fluorescence in situ hybridization. CVA were diagnosed with the use of echocardiography, cardiac catheterization, or computerized tomographic angiography. Freedom from intervention was determined using Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS: The study group was 129 patients with CVA. Age at presentation was 127 +/- 116 days, with follow-up of 8.0 +/- 7.5 years (0 to 42 years). The most common lesions were peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis (62%) and supravalvar aortic stenosis (57%). Other CVA were common. CV interventions were performed in 29%, with 58% of those before 1 year. Freedom from intervention was 85%, 73%, and 66% at 1, 5, and 25 years, respectively. Four patients died. CONCLUSIONS: CVA are the most common manifestations of infantile Williams syndrome and occur with greater frequency than previously reported. In those with CVA, interventions are common and usually occur by 5 years of age. Most of these patients do not require intervention on long-term follow-up, and overall mortality is low.",

Due to its rare occurrence, outcome data for operations and cardiac catheterization are limited. We reviewed data from 242 individuals from the Pediatric Cardiac Care Consortium (PCCC) with Williams syndrome and associated cardiovascular lesions, and their frequency, and assessed their effects on mortality. In the PCCC, from 1984 to 1999 there were approximately 100,000 entries for cardiac procedures, involving more than 62,000 patients. The diagnosis of Williams syndrome was based on clinical features and determined by each site. Most patients were diagnosed with the availability of the FISH probe for region 7q11.23. Using a spreadsheet application, Microsoft Excel, the selected patients were analyzed for various types of cardiac anomalies. The most common cardiovascular lesions and the mortality rate in patients with Williams syndrome were examined. A complete tabulation of all cardiovascular lesions was assembled. There were 292 catheterizations and 143 operations reported to the PCCC. One hundred six patients had both an operation and a catheterization. The three main cardiovascular anomalies were supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS; 169), pulmonary artery stenosis (PAS; 130), and coarctation or aortic arch hypoplasia (Arch; 32). One hundred five patients had a single lesion, 70 with SVAS, 29 with PAS, and 6 with an arch anomaly. Ninety-two had more than one lesion: 80 with SVAS and PAS, 7 with PAS and Arch, and 5 with SVAS and Arch. Seventy individuals have only SVAS, 29 PAS, and 6 Arch alone. There was a total of 15 deaths. The mortality rate was highest in the group with the combination of SVAS and PAS (7 surgical and 5 catheter; 12 of 80 patients [15%]; p = 0.0001, chi(2)). In conclusion, our data represent the largest collection of individuals with Williams syndrome who underwent cardiac catheterization and/or operation. The data suggest that children with Williams syndrome and bilateral outflow tract obstruction have statistically and clinically significantly higher mortality associated with catheterization or operation.",

                    "abstract": "Williams syndrome (WS) is a multisystem congenital disorder affecting 1/8000 live births. Our objective was to review our experience with stenosis of the thoracic aorta (STA) in these patients. A retrospective review was undertaken of consecutive WS patients at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia from January 1, 1980, through December 31, 2007. WS was diagnosed by an experienced medical geneticist and/or by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Stenosis was diagnosed with either echocardiography or cardiac catheterization. Freedom from intervention was determined using Kaplan-Meier analysis. From a total cohort of 270 patients, 37 (14%) patients with STA were identified and comprised the study group. Age at presentation was 2.1 + or - 4.0 years, and follow-up was 11.8 + or - 12.6 years (range 0-51). Long-segment STA was more common (89%) than discrete STA. Severity of STA was mild in 18, moderate in 10, and severe in 9 patients. Branch pulmonary artery stenosis was seen in 62% (23 of 37) of STA patients, and supravalvar aortic stenosis was seen in 54% (20 of 37) STA patients. Nine (24%) patients underwent intervention for STA: 8 cases were severe, and 1 case was moderate. Restenosis resulting in reintervention occurred in 5 of 9 (56%) patients, with 4 of 5 (80%) patients undergoing multiple reinterventions. Freedom from intervention was 89, 82, and 73% at 1, 5, and 20 years, respectively. One patient died. STA is common in WS and is generally the long-segment type. In patients with STA, interventions are common and usually occur by 5 years of age. Reintervention for STA occurs frequently.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of cardiovascular abnormalities (CVA) and outcomes in patients with Williams syndrome presenting before 1 year of age. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective review was undertaken of consecutive patients with WS at our institution from January 1, 1980, through December 31, 2007. WS was diagnosed by an experienced medical geneticist and/or by fluorescence in situ hybridization. CVA were diagnosed with the use of echocardiography, cardiac catheterization, or computerized tomographic angiography. Freedom from intervention was determined using Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS: The study group was 129 patients with CVA. Age at presentation was 127 +/- 116 days, with follow-up of 8.0 +/- 7.5 years (0 to 42 years). The most common lesions were peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis (62%) and supravalvar aortic stenosis (57%). Other CVA were common. CV interventions were performed in 29%, with 58% of those before 1 year. Freedom from intervention was 85%, 73%, and 66% at 1, 5, and 25 years, respectively. Four patients died. CONCLUSIONS: CVA are the most common manifestations of infantile Williams syndrome and occur with greater frequency than previously reported. In those with CVA, interventions are common and usually occur by 5 years of age. Most of these patients do not require intervention on long-term follow-up, and overall mortality is low.",

Due to its rare occurrence, outcome data for operations and cardiac catheterization are limited. We reviewed data from 242 individuals from the Pediatric Cardiac Care Consortium (PCCC) with Williams syndrome and associated cardiovascular lesions, and their frequency, and assessed their effects on mortality. In the PCCC, from 1984 to 1999 there were approximately 100,000 entries for cardiac procedures, involving more than 62,000 patients. The diagnosis of Williams syndrome was based on clinical features and determined by each site. Most patients were diagnosed with the availability of the FISH probe for region 7q11.23. Using a spreadsheet application, Microsoft Excel, the selected patients were analyzed for various types of cardiac anomalies. The most common cardiovascular lesions and the mortality rate in patients with Williams syndrome were examined. A complete tabulation of all cardiovascular lesions was assembled. There were 292 catheterizations and 143 operations reported to the PCCC. One hundred six patients had both an operation and a catheterization. The three main cardiovascular anomalies were supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS; 169), pulmonary artery stenosis (PAS; 130), and coarctation or aortic arch hypoplasia (Arch; 32). One hundred five patients had a single lesion, 70 with SVAS, 29 with PAS, and 6 with an arch anomaly. Ninety-two had more than one lesion: 80 with SVAS and PAS, 7 with PAS and Arch, and 5 with SVAS and Arch. Seventy individuals have only SVAS, 29 PAS, and 6 Arch alone. There was a total of 15 deaths. The mortality rate was highest in the group with the combination of SVAS and PAS (7 surgical and 5 catheter; 12 of 80 patients [15%]; p = 0.0001, chi(2)). In conclusion, our data represent the largest collection of individuals with Williams syndrome who underwent cardiac catheterization and/or operation. The data suggest that children with Williams syndrome and bilateral outflow tract obstruction have statistically and clinically significantly higher mortality associated with catheterization or operation.",
