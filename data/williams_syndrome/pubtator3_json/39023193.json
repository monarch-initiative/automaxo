                    "text": "INTRODUCTION: Williams syndrome (WS) cases have been reported to have with 25-100 times greater increased risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD). SCD has been reported in cases without any evidence of structural cardiovascular anomalies. Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is characterized by short PR interval and delta wave. Ventricular preexcitations can develop paroxysmal reentrant tachycardia through Kent bundle or less frequent atrial fibrillation and in some cases with accessory pathway effective refractory period (APERP) under 250 ms considered as risky and may lead to SCD. WS associated with WPW has not been reported before. CASE REPORT: An 11-year-old male who had been followed up with WS was referred to pediatric cardiology outpatient clinic with the complaint of palpitation. Electrocardiographic examination showed short PR interval and delta wave in the ECG consistent with WPW. He underwent electrophysiological study (EPS). Basic measurements were performed, and APERP was found at 280 ms cycle atrial pacing. RF energy was delivered using a 4 mm tip nonirrigated radiofrequency (RF) ablation catheter where the best ventriculoatrial (VA) signals were received and the AP was abolished within few seconds. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Although, WPW cases are usually asymptomatic or related to SVT, the risk of SCD should not be ignored. Thus, all patients with WPW deserve an EPS for assessing the AP conduction properties. Due to the increased risk of SCD in patients with WS compared to general population, in the presence of concomitant WPW, these patients should be evaluated with EPS even if they do not have symptoms.",
