To investigate the impact of pragmatic difficulties on listener-role referential communication, we administered a picture placement task designed to measure ability to verbalize message inadequacy to a speaker separated by a barrier. Participants were 57 children with Williams syndrome 6 to 12 years of age. When messages were inadequate, children verbalized that a problem was encountered less than half the time. The likelihood that children would indicate a message was insufficient and that children who verbalized message inadequacy also would effectively communicate the problem varied as a function of type of problem encountered, theory of mind knowledge, receptive vocabulary, and CA.",
