Based on the cognitive and personality profiles characteristic of children with this syndrome, we predicted that the domains of Socialization and Communication would be relative strengths, whereas Daily Living Skills and Motor Skills would be relative weaknesses. We also expected that Socialization Skills would be more advanced than Communication skills, and that within the Socialization domain, interpersonal skills would be stronger than play/leisure or coping skills. All predictions were confirmed. Adaptive behavior standard score was not related to CA. The children earned similar overall standard scores on the Vineland and the Differential Ability Scales. Interrelations among adaptive behavior, cognitive abilities, and personality characteristics are discussed.",
