input_text: 'Outcomes of an 8-Week Treadmill Training Program for a Toddler With Williams
  Syndrome: A Case Report. PURPOSE: This case report highlights the functional and
  quality-of-life outcomes of an 8-week treadmill training program for an 18-month
  old child with Williams syndrome who is not walking. SUMMARY OF KEY POINTS: The
  child had clinical improvements in gross motor function and quality of life as determined
  by the Gross Motor Function Measure and Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory after
  8 weeks of treadmill training as an outpatient. STATEMENT OF CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
  FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE: Treadmill training is clinically feasible and effective for
  this child with Williams syndrome. Further research is necessary for generalizability.
  Treadmill training should be considered when developing a plan of care for children
  with Williams syndrome who are not walking or children with similar deficits.'
