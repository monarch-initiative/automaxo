input_text: Concomitant reentrant tachycardias from concealed accessory atrioventricular
  bypass tract and atrioventricular nodal reentry in a patient with Williams syndrome.
  Williams syndrome is characterized by a constellation of features including mental
  retardation and supravalvular aortic stenosis. Other cardiovascular abnormalities
  including arrhythmias contributing to sudden death have been described in these
  patients. In this report we describe a case of a 49-year-old female with Williams
  syndrome who presented with severe symptomatic supraventricular tachycardia. Cardiac
  electrophysiology study identified a left posteroseptal concealed accessory bypass
  tract responsible for atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia and a concomitant typical
  atrioventricular nodal tachycardia. Such unusual association of combination of two
  different types of supraventricular tachycardia and Williams syndrome has not been
  previously reported. Radiofrequency ablation was successfully performed to cure
  these arrhythmias.
