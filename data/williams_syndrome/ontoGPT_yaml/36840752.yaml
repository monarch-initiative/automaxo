input_text: "Transplantation in paediatric patients with MMA requires multidisciplinary
  approach for achievement of good clinical outcomes. BACKGROUND: As modern medicine
  is advancing, younger, small, and more complex children are becoming multi-organ
  transplant candidates. This brings up new challenges in all aspects of their care.
  METHODS: We describe the first report of a small child receiving a simultaneous
  liver and kidney transplant and abdominal rectus sheath fascia transplant on the
  background of Williams syndrome and methylmalonic acidaemia. At the time of transplantation,
  the child was 3 years old, weighed 14.0 kg, had chronic kidney disease stage V,
  and had not yet started any other form of kidney replacement therapy. RESULTS: There
  were many anaesthetic, medical, metabolic, and surgical challenges to consider in
  this case. A long general anaesthetic time increased the risk of cardiac complications
  and metabolic decompensation. Additionally, the small size of the patient and the
  organ size mis-match meant that primary abdominal closure was not possible. The
  patient's recovery was further complicated by sepsis, transient CNI toxicity, and
  de novo DSAs. CONCLUSIONS: Through a multidisciplinary approach between 9 specialties
  in 4 hospitals across England and Wales, and detailed pre-operative planning, a
  good outcome was achieved for this child. An hour by hour management protocol was
  drafted to facilitate transplant and included five domains: 1. management at the
  time of organ offer; 2. before the admission; 3. at admission and before theatre
  time; 4. intra-operative management; and 5. post-operative management in the first
  24 h. Importantly, gaining a clear and in depth understanding of the metabolic state
  of the patient pre- and peri-operatively was crucial in avoiding metabolic decompensation.
  Furthermore, an abdominal rectus sheath fascia transplant was required to achieve
  abdominal closure, which to our knowledge, had never been done before for this indication.
  Using our experience of this complex case, as well as our experience in transplanting
  other children with MMA, and through a literature review, we propose a new perioperative
  management pathway for this complex cohort of transplant recipients."
