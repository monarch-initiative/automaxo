input_text: 'Hyperacusis in Williams syndrome: characteristics and associated neuroaudiologic
  abnormalities. BACKGROUND: Hyperacusis and phonophobia are common, debilitating
  symptoms in Williams syndrome (WS), yet little is known about their underlying audiologic
  and neurologic processes. METHODS: The mothers of 49 subjects with WS were asked
  to complete the Hyperacusis Screening Questionnaire. Subjects with reported hyperacusis
  and sufficient developmental capacity underwent comprehensive audiological and brain
  auditory evoked response (BAER) testing. Findings were compared with those from
  pair-matched typically developing control subjects. RESULTS: Forty-one of the 49
  children with WS (84%) had hyperacusis of moderate to severe degree, which began
  in infancy. Of these, 21 (mean age 15.8 +/- 5.5 years) were quantitatively tested.
  Subjects with WS reported discomfort at sound intensities on average 20 dB lower
  than control subjects. Pure-tone audiometry and distortion products otoacoustic
  emission test revealed a high-frequency cochlear hearing loss. An absence of ipsilateral
  acoustic reflex responses to maximum stimulation was significantly more common in
  the subjects with WS than controls. On BAER testing, the WS group had a significant
  prolongation in wave I latency. CONCLUSIONS: Hyperacusis in Williams syndrome (WS)
  is associated with a high-frequency hearing loss resembling the configuration of
  noise-induced hearing loss. The hyperacusis and hearing loss in WS may stem from
  a deficiency in the acoustic reflex resulting from auditory nerve dysfunction. Additional
  mechanisms that may mediate hyperacusis in WS and should be evaluated in future
  studies include recruitment, malformation of the facial canal, and haploinsufficiency
  of the elastin gene.'
