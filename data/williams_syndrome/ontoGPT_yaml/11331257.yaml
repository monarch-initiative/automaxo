input_text: 'Balloon dilation angioplasty of peripheral pulmonary stenosis associated
  with Williams syndrome. BACKGROUND: Experience of balloon dilation of peripheral
  pulmonary stenosis (PPS) in Williams syndrome (WS) is limited. METHODS AND RESULTS:
  Catheterizations in all patients with WS undergoing therapy for PPS from 1984 to
  1999 were reviewed. Criteria for successful dilation included an increase >50% in
  predilation diameter and a decrease >20% in ratio of right ventricular (RV) to aortic
  (Ao) systolic pressure. Median age and weight were 1.5 years and 9.5 kg. There were
  134 dilations during 39 procedures in 25 patients. The success rate for initial
  dilations was 51%. In multivariate analysis, successful dilation was more likely
  (1) in distal than in central pulmonary arteries (P=0.02), (2) if the balloon waist
  resolved with inflation (P=0.001), and (3) with larger balloon/stenosis ratio (P<0.001).
  RV pressure was unchanged after dilation (96+/-30 versus 97+/-31 mm Hg), primarily
  because of failure to enlarge central pulmonary arteries. The Ao pressure increased
  (102+/-14 versus 109+/-19 mm Hg, P=0.03), and the RV/Ao pressure ratio decreased
  (0.97+/-0.34 versus 0.91+/-0.30, P=0.05). Aneurysms developed after 24 dilations
  (18%) and were not related to balloon/stenosis ratio. Balloon rupture in 12 dilations
  produced an aneurysm in all 7 cases when rupture was in a hypoplastic segment. Three
  patients died, none from pulmonary artery trauma, and all before 1994. CONCLUSIONS:
  Mortality occurred early in our experience. Despite successful dilation of distal
  pulmonary arteries, there was modest initial hemodynamic improvement, mainly because
  of persistent central pulmonary artery obstruction. A serial approach of distal
  dilations followed by surgical repair of proximal obstruction may be a rational
  and successful therapy.'
