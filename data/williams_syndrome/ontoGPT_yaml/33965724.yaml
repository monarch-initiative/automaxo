input_text: 'Auditory hypersensitivity in Williams syndrome. OBJECTIVES: The objective
  of this study was to investigate auditory hypersensitivity in WS and to evaluate
  hyperacusis through standardized protocols, checking if it can be associated with
  the absence of acoustic reflexes in people with WS. METHOD: The study was performed
  in 17 individuals with WS, aged between seven and 17 years old (10 males and seven
  females), and 17 individuals with typical development age- and gender-matched to
  individuals with WS. Statistical tests were used to analyze the responses collected
  with the Loudness Discomfort Level (LDL) test as well as ipsilateral and contralateral
  reflex responses. RESULTS: Auditory hypersensitivity was commonly found. Individuals
  with WS had phonophobia and were less tolerant to high sound intensity, presenting
  a reduced discomfort threshold compared to those with typical development. However,
  hyperacusis was found in 35.29% of individuals with WS and was mild in 50% of cases.
  There was an association between hyperacusis and acoustic reflex responses, and
  individuals with absence of the contralateral acoustic reflex were more likely to
  have hyperacusis. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with WS have a high prevalence of auditory
  hypersensitivity, with the presence of phonophobia; however, hyperacusis was not
  as prevalent and may be associated with the absence of contralateral acoustic reflexes.'
