input_text: "Isolated cervical spinal canal stenosis at C-1 in the pediatric population
  and in Williams syndrome. OBJECT: Isolated cervical canal stenosis at the level
  of the atlas (C-1) is a rare cause of cervical myelopathy in the pediatric population.
  It has been associated with several genetic disorders including spondyloepiphysial
  dysplasia congenita, Down syndrome, and Klippel-Feil syndrome. The purpose of this
  study is to highlight the authors' experience with 4 additional pediatric cases,
  review the literature, and report a new association of this disease with Williams
  syndrome. METHODS: The medical records and radiological imaging studies of 4 patients
  treated at Texas Children's Hospital for symptomatic hypoplasia of the atlas were
  retrospectively reviewed. Pertinent patient demographic data, clinical presentation,
  imaging findings, and outcomes after surgery were recorded. A thorough literature
  review was performed, allowing the authors to compare and contrast their 4 cases
  to surgical cases already published in the literature. RESULTS: There were 11 boys
  and 1 girl in the aggregate series. The average age of the patients was 7 years
  (range 13 months-14 years), and the duration of symptoms prior to presentation was
  6 months (range 0-36 months). The mean sagittal diameter of the spinal canal at
  the level of the atlas measured from the posterior aspect of the dens to the anterior
  aspect of the arch of C-1 was 11.9 mm (range 8.3-16 mm) in the aggregate series.
  In 2 new pediatric patients with hypoplasia of the atlas the disease was associated
  with Williams syndrome, which has not been previously described. Patients in the
  aggregate series were followed for an average of 18 months (range 3-50 months).
  Laminectomy of C-1 provided neurological improvement in all patients who presented.
  CONCLUSIONS: Isolated cervical spinal canal stenosis at the level of the atlas is
  a rare cause of cervical myelopathy. The authors hope that this report will prompt
  clinicians to consider it when searching for the origin of signs and symptoms of
  cervical myelopathy, especially in children."
