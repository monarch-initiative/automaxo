input_text: The operative outcome in children with supravalvular aortic stenosis.
  The authors present their experience in surgical treatment of children with supravalvular
  aortic stenosis (SAS). A retrospective analysis was carried out on 20 patients operated
  in the years 1980-1999. The group included 12 boys and 8 girls aged 0.9 to 14.5
  years (mean 7.8 +/- 3.4 years). The diagnosis of Williams syndrome in 6 children
  (30%) was based on the typical face. The mean systolic pressure gradient across
  the SAS was 84.3 +/- 34.5 mmHg (range from 41 to 168 mmHg). Intraoperative studies
  allowed to determine that 16 (80%) children had the hourglass type, 2 (10%) tubular
  type and 2 (10%)--fibromuscular membrane type of stenosis. Sixteen (80%) children
  had anomalies of the aortic valve and/or coronary arteries, and in 13 (56%) children
  associated heart or great vessels anomalies were noted. All the patients were operated
  on using cardiopulmonary bypass and hypothermia. The associated anomalies were corrected
  simultaneously. There were no early and late deaths. Because of restenosis one child
  was reoperated. In the follow up the mean systolic pressure gradient between the
  left ventricle and ascending aorta revealed by echocardiography in 19 (95%) children
  to be 8 +/- 2 mmHg (range from 0 to 28 mmHg). Eighteen children are now in NYHA
  class I (New York Heart Association) and develop normally. Supravalvular aortic
  stenosis is a rare complex anomaly, which, because of life-threatening complications
  and low operative risk, should be fully repaired as soon as possible.
