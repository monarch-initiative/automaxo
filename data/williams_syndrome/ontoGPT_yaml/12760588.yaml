input_text: "Supravalvar aortic stenosis: clinical and hemodynamic profile, and surgical
  outcome. BACKGROUND: Supravalvar aortic stenosis is the rarest of left ventricular
  outflow obstructions. Data on this rare entity from India are scarce. METHODS AND
  RESULTS: We retrospectively analyzed the data of 15 patients (13 males, mean age
  15.5+/-10.18 years) with a diagnosis of supravalvar aortic stenosis confirmed by
  cardiac catheterization. Five patients had morphological features of Williams' syndrome.
  One patient had diffuse while the rest had discrete type of supravalvar aortic stenosis.
  Five patients did not have any associated lesions. A 9-year-old male had an ascending
  aortic aneurysm, and 3 patients had associated peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis.
  One child had a subaortic ventricular septal defect, and another had severe mitral
  regurgitation. Twelve patients had electrocardiographic evidence of left ventricular
  hypertrophy. Three patients had mild aortic valvar stenosis while 2 had aortic regurgitation.
  Six patients had dilated coronary arteries. Two patients with supravalvar aortic
  gradients of 20 and 40 mmHg were kept on close follow-up. One patient was not willing
  to undergo surgery while the other is awaiting surgery. Eleven patients underwent
  surgical correction. Dacron or pericardial patch aortoplasty was done in all the
  patients. In addition, one patient each underwent pulmonary artery plasty, ventricular
  septal defect closure, repair of ascending aortic aneurysm, and mitral valve replacement.
  The patient with diffuse type of supravalvar aortic stenosis underwent augmentation
  aortoplasty. Two patients died perioperatively. One was lost to follow-up. Two had
  moderate residual gradients. The rest of the patients were in New York Heart Association
  functional class I on follow-up of 6.3+/-4.7 years. CONCLUSIONS: Repair of supravalvar
  aortic stenosis by single sinus aortoplasty is safe and produces good results."
