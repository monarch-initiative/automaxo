input_text: Cardiac arrest related to anaesthesia in Williams-Beuren syndrome. Williams-Beuren
  syndrome is the clinical manifestation of a congenital genetic disorder in the elastin
  gene, among others. There is a history of cardiac arrest refractory to resuscitation
  manoeuvres in anaesthesia. The incidence of myocardial ischaemia is high during
  anaesthetic induction, but there are patients who do not have this condition yet
  also have had very serious cardiac events, and issues that are still to be resolved.
  Case descriptions will enable the common pathophysiological factors to be defined,
  and decrease morbidity and mortality. We report the case of a 3-year-old boy with
  cardiac arrest at induction, rescued with circulatory assistance with extracorporeal
  membrane oxygenation and hypothermia induced for cerebral protection.
