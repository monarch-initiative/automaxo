input_text: The impact of developmental visuospatial learning difficulties on British
  Sign Language. There has been substantial research interest in recent years in the
  relationship between the development of language and cognition, especially where
  dissociations can be seen between them. Williams syndrome, a rare congenital disorder
  characterized by a fractionation of higher cortical functions, with relatively preserved
  language but marked difficulties with visuospatial constructive cognition, has been
  extensively studied. The case of Heather, who is remarkably similar to the characteristic
  phenotype of Williams syndrome in physical appearance and cognitive abilities, but
  who is also congenitally deaf and a user of British Sign Language, provides the
  first opportunity to explore the consequences of specific visuospatial learning
  difficulties on the linguistic system when the language used is visuospatial. Heather
  shows a pattern of impaired drawing ability and visual form discrimination, but
  preserved ability to discriminate faces. She has a large vocabulary in British Sign
  Language, and overall presents a picture of relative competence in British Sign
  Language grammar. However, she shows specific deficits in those areas of British
  Sign Language which directly rely on spatial representations for linguistic purposes.
  A number of theories as to the nature of her impairments and those found in Williams
  syndrome are discussed, using models of the relationship between language and visuospatial
  cognition based on data from this unique case.
