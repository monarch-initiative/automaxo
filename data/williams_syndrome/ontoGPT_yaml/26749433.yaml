input_text: 'Description of common musculoskeletal findings in Williams Syndrome and
  implications for therapies. Williams syndrome (WS), also referred to as Williams-Beuren
  syndrome (WBS), is a relatively rare genetic disorder affecting ~1/10,000 persons.
  Since the disorder is caused by a micro-deletion of ~1.5 Mb, it is not surprising
  that the manifestations of WS are extremely broad, involving most body systems.
  In this paper, we primarily focus on the musculoskeletal aspects of WS as these
  findings have not been the subject of a comprehensive review. We review the MSK
  features commonly seen in individuals with WS, along with related sensory and neurological
  issues interacting with and compounding underlying MSK abnormalities. We end by
  providing perspective, particularly from the vantage point of a physical therapist,
  on therapeutic interventions to address the most common MSK and related features
  seen in WS. Clin. Anat. 29:578-589, 2016.   2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. '
