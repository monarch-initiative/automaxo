input_text: "[Effective use of electrolized soft acid aqueous solution for treatment
  of mediastinitis following cardiac surgery]. Mediastinitis following cardiac surgery
  occurs infrequently, but features both high mortality and morbidity, especially
  in patients with an artificial graft. A 24-year-old man was admitted with a diagnosis
  of Williams'syndrome with supraaortic stenosis. After ascending aorta and hemiarch
  reconstruction, mediastinitis developed, which was treated successfully with mediastinal
  irrigation using electrolized soft acid aqueous solution at one liter per day for
  3 days. This procedure appears to be an effective method for treatment of mediastinitis
  following cardiac surgery."
