input_text: '[Congenital tubular supravalvular aortic stenosis with massive coronary
  artery dilatation in a 35-year-old man]. Supravalvular aortic stenosis is a rare
  cause of left ventricular outflow obstruction in adults. It occurs as an isolated
  defect sporadically or on a hereditary basis with an autosomal dominant trait without
  further phenotypical anomalies, or as part of the Williams syndrome with mental
  retardation and multiple other anomalies. This lesion was proved to result from
  a defect of the elastin coding gene. Supravalvular aortic stenosis is frequently
  associated with cardiovascular defects, particularly of the peripheral pulmonary
  arteries, thoracic aorta, carotid, subclavian, and coronary arteries and the aortic
  valve. The coronary arteries are subject to an increased perfusion pressure leading
  to dilatation, tortuosity and accelerated arteriosclerosis. We give details of a
  35-year-old patient in whom a previously asymptomatic supravalvular aortic stenosis
  is associated with an excessive dilatation of the right coronary artery and the
  left anterior descending coronary artery as well as an ostium stenosis of the left
  common carotid artery. The patient did not present any phenotypical anomalies of
  the Williams syndrome.'
