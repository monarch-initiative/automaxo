input_text: 'Surgery for bilateral outflow tract obstruction in elastin arteriopathy.
  OBJECTIVE: A number of patients with Williams syndrome or other forms of elastin
  arteriopathy have stenoses of pulmonary arteries in addition to supravalvular aortic
  stenosis. We sought to investigate the effect of the degree of pulmonary arterial
  stenosis on the prognosis after an operation for supravalvular aortic stenosis to
  help define the optimal treatment strategy for patients with severe forms of elastin
  arteriopathy. METHODS: Between 1960 and 1999, 33 patients underwent operations for
  supravalvular aortic stenosis while having significant stenoses of the pulmonary
  arteries. We retrospectively reviewed patient charts, obtained current follow-up
  information, and determined risk factors for survival and reoperation. RESULTS:
  Fifteen patients with moderate right-sided obstructions (confirmed by pulmonary
  artery Z-scores and right ventricular/descending aortic pressure ratio) underwent
  operations for supravalvular aortic stenosis only. Eighteen patients had more severe
  right-sided obstructions and underwent surgical relief of pulmonary arterial stenoses
  or right ventricular outflow tract obstruction in addition to operations for supravalvular
  aortic stenosis. Eight patients had undergone preoperative balloon dilations of
  stenotic pulmonary arteries. There were 6 early deaths and 1 late death in our series.
  Survival at 10 and 20 years was 76% (70% confidence interval, 68%-84%) and freedom
  from reintervention was 59% (70% confidence interval, 46%-71%) at 10 years and 49%
  (70% confidence interval, 35%-62%) at 20 years. Multivariate analysis revealed that
  patients with a right ventricular/descending aortic pressure ratio of 1.0 or more
  were at higher risk for reintervention but not for death. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical
  treatment of pulmonary artery obstructions in elastin arteriopathy is palliative
  but, in conjunction with balloon dilation of peripheral pulmonary arteries, offers
  good long-term survival to patients with the severest form of elastin arteriopathy.'
