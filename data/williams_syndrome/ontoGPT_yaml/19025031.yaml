input_text: Hyperactive auditory efferent system and lack of acoustic reflexes in
  Williams syndrome. The auditory efferent system and acoustic reflexes have been
  investigated in patients with Williams syndrome (WS). Twenty-one patients aged 6-26
  years with a genetically confirmed diagnosis of WS and with reported hyperacusis
  were compared with 21 normally developing age-matched subjects. The medial olivocochlear
  (MOC) efferent system was tested by stimulation of the contralateral ear with increasing
  levels of white noise, while recording transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE)
  in the ipsilateral ear. The suppression effect on the amplitudes of the TEOAE was
  computed for each contralateral stimulus level. This measure reflects the strength
  of the MOC efferent system. In addition, the thresholds of ipsilateral and contralateral
  acoustic reflexes in response to 1, 2 and 4 kHz tones as well as to broadband stimuli
  were also recorded. Results showed that patients with WS had a significantly higher
  suppression effect of the MOC reflex on TEOAE. Ipsilateral and contralateral acoustic
  reflexes to tonal and broadband stimuli presented at maximum stimulus intensities
  were absent in 62-86% of the patients with WS. In the remainder, acoustic reflexes
  were elicited at lower auditory sensation thresholds than in controls. Hyperexcitability
  of the MOC efferent system coupled with absence of acoustic reflexes may contribute
  to the hyperacusis in WS and the consequent high-tone hearing loss induced by environmental
  noise. Both measures can be used for objective detection and thus, intervention
  of hyperacusis in the early stages of life.
