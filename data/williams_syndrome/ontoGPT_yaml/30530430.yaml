input_text: Intractable apnoeic seizures in a child with a deletion typically associated
  with Williams syndrome. Williams-Beuren syndrome is rarely associated with epilepsy.
  One previously reported case showed an association with apnoeic seizures while a
  few other cases showed an association with infantile epileptic spasms and generalized
  and focal seizures. We report the case of a 13-month-old boy with a deletion typically
  associated with Williams-Beuren syndrome, who presented with isolated apnoeic seizures
  which were refractory to multiple antiepileptic drugs but partially responsive to
  the ketogenic diet. The diagnosis was challenging due to a complex cardiac history,
  gastroesophageal reflux, and normal interictal EEG findings. This case highlights
  the importance of prolonged EEG monitoring in suspected cases of apnoeic seizures.
  Further, given the reported cases of unexplained sudden death in Williams-Beuren
  syndrome, this case raises the possibility of an association between apnoeic seizures
  and unexplained sudden death. [Published with video sequence on www.epilepticdisorders.com].
