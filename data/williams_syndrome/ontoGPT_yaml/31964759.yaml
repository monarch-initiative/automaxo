input_text: Health Care Supervision for Children With Williams Syndrome. This set
  of recommendations is designed to assist the pediatrician in caring for children
  with Williams syndrome (WS) who were diagnosed by using clinical features and with
  chromosome 7 microdeletion confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization, chromosome
  microarray, or multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. The recommendations
  in this report reflect review of the current literature, including previously peer-reviewed
  and published management suggestions for WS, as well as the consensus of physicians
  and psychologists with expertise in the care of individuals with WS. These general
  recommendations for the syndrome do not replace individualized medical assessment
  and treatment.
