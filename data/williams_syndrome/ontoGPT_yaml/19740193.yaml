input_text: A case report of rapid progressive coarctation and severe middle aortic
  syndrome in an infant with Williams syndrome. Williams syndrome is a genetic disorder
  caused by multiple contiguous gene deletions in chromosome 7. Presentation in early
  life is most often a result of luminal stenosis of right- and left-sided arterial
  vasculature. We report the case of a newborn infant who had a rapidly progressing
  diffuse form of arteriopathy that required two surgeries and one percutaneous balloon
  dilation within the first 2 months of her life.

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  subject_extension: <A chemical or drug mentioned in the relationship between the medical action and the symptom, for example, "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  object_extension: <An optional term describing some specific aspect of the object, e.g. "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  subject: <The medical action. For example: blood transfusion, radiation therapy, cardiac catheterization, pulse oximetry, otoscopy>
  predicate: <The relationship type between the medical action and the symptom, usually TREATS or PREVENTS.>
