input_text: 'Drug-Coated Balloon Angioplasty: A Novel Treatment for Pulmonary Artery
  In-Stent Stenosis in a Patient with Williams Syndrome. A 20-month-old boy with Williams
  syndrome had undergone multiple surgical and catheter-based interventions for resistant
  peripheral pulmonary arterial stenoses with eventual bilateral stent placement and
  conventional balloon angioplasty. He persistently developed suprasystemic right
  ventricular (RV) pressure. Angioplasty with a drug-coated balloon (DCB) was performed
  for in-stent restenosis and to remodel his distal pulmonary vessels bilaterally.
  This resulted in immediate improvement in the in-stent stenosis and resultant decrease
  in RV pressure. Follow-up catheterization two months later continued to show long-lasting
  improvement in the in-stent stenosis. We hypothesize that the anti-proliferative
  effects of DCBs may be of benefit in the arteriopathy associated with Williams syndrome.
  We report this as a novel use of a DCB in the pulmonary arterial circulation in
  a patient with Williams syndrome.'
