input_text: "Cutting balloon angioplasty on branch pulmonary artery stenosis in pediatric
  patients. OBJECTIVES: To identify medium-term results following cutting balloon
  angioplasty (CBA) for branch pulmonary artery stenosis (PAS) and predictors of successful
  intervention. BACKGROUND: CBA has emerged as a successful alternative therapy for
  PAS resistant to conventional balloon angioplasty techniques but there is little
  information on medium and long-term outcomes. METHODS: This is a descriptive, single
  center, retrospective chart review of pediatric patients who underwent CBA for PAS
  at Arkansas Children's Hospital between May 2005 and December 2020. We reviewed
  demographics, procedural specifics, and 30-day complications. RESULTS: Forty-four
  patients underwent pulmonary artery CBA on 114 pulmonary artery segments through
  126 catheterization cases, totaling 148 CBA events. Thirty-three individual pulmonary
  arteries underwent repeat intervention. Average minimal luminal diameter increase
  from pre-CBA to end of follow-up was 57% (CI, 38%-75%). Absence of Tetralogy of
  Fallot with pulmonary atresia and major aortopulmonary collateral arteries (TOF/PA/MAPCAs)
  and the absence of Alagille Syndrome, Williams Syndrome, or Arterial Tortuosity
  Syndrome (ATS) were associated with increased odds of sustained success by 70% (CI,
  0.11-0.79) and 91% (CI, 0.02-0.56), respectively. Increasing the cutting balloon
  diameter-to-minimal luminal diameter ratio by 0.5 increased odds of successful intervention
  by 2.37-fold (CI, 1.7-3.3). Seven patients had 30-day complications including one
  death. CONCLUSIONS: In the longest follow-up to date of children and adolescents
  who underwent CBA for branch PAS, we found that there was moderate medium-term success.
  Additionally, absence of TOF/PA/MAPCAs, absence of Alagille Syndrome, Williams Syndrome,
  or ATS, and high cutting balloon diameter-to-minimal luminal diameter ratio are
  predictors of sustained results."
