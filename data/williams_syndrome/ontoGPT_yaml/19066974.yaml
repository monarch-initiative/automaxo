input_text: 'Renal dysplasia/hypoplasia, Williams Syndrome phenotype and non-Hodgkin
  lymphoma in the same patient: only a coincidence? Congenital renal anomalies, Williams
  Syndrome and non-Hodgkin lymphoma all occur separately at low incidence, so their
  simultaneous presence in the same patient is exceptional. We present a young patient
  manifesting all three conditions. This child is a boy with a Williams Syndrome phenotype
  who was diagnosed with severe chronic kidney disease secondary to bilateral renal
  dysplasia/hypoplasia. Due to his small size, he received treatment with growth hormone.
  He progressed to end stage kidney disease and, after 8 months, a renal transplant
  was performed. A number of suspicious abdominal adenopathies were removed during
  the surgery and, thereafter, immunosupressive treatment with prednisone, azathioprine
  and cyclosporine was initiated. Examination of the biopsy tissue confirmed the presence
  of a T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma. Appropriate chemotherapy was given, and the
  immunosupressive regimen was eventually reduced to prednisone alone. Now, 8 years
  since the initial diagnosis of T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma and 6 years after the
  completion of the chemotherapy, the patient is still in complete remission with
  a functional donor kidney. We discuss some possible explanations of this association.
  Chemotherapy has not appeared to have affected the viability of the grafted kidney
  and, in fact, it may even have induced immunotolerance.'
