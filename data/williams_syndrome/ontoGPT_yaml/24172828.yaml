input_text: 'Odontostomatological aspects in patients with Williams syndrome: a series
  of 4 cases. The authors examined four patients with Williams syndrome presenting
  characteristic odontostomatological alterations. Agenesis, dental deposits, chewing
  difficulties due to bone malformations and poor cooperation of patients with malformations
  also in other districts and mental and physical retardation require the dentist
  to adopt different approaches, from restorative to orthodontic treatment, from periodontal
  to professional oral hygiene treatment. '
