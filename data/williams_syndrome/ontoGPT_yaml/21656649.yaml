input_text: Left main coronary artery stenting after cardiac arrest in an infant with
  William's syndrome. A 6-month-old female with William's syndrome and biventricular
  outflow obstruction had a cardiac arrest due to myocardial ischemia soon after induction
  of anesthesia during cardiac catheterization. The patient was supported with extra
  corporeal membrane oxygenator (ECMO) and successful stenting of the left main coronary
  artery was performed as a rescue measure. This intervention allowed successful weaning
  from ECMO and subsequent discharge from the hospital. Coronary intervention in infants
  may be successfully performed in dire situations.
