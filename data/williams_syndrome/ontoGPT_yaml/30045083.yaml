input_text: 'Cardiovascular disease in Williams syndrome. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Williams
  syndrome is a multisystem disorder seen with some regularity at most pediatric centers
  and usually fairly often at larger centers. Cardiovascular abnormalities, because
  of elastin deficiency, are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients
  with Williams syndrome. The present article presents a review of the most recent
  developments regarding the cardiovascular issues in Williams syndrome. RECENT FINDINGS:
  Cardiovascular abnormalities occur in 80% of patients with Williams syndrome, the
  majority of which are arterial stenoses. The stenoses seen in Williams syndrome
  now appear to arise from deficient circumferential arterial growth. Pharmacological
  therapies aimed at improving the vascular stenoses have shown some promise in animal
  models. Surgical outcomes for supravalvar aortic stenosis are good at most centers.
  Transcatheter interventions are largely ineffective in Williams syndrome. Multilevel
  surgical pulmonary artery reconstruction has excellent results for peripheral pulmonary
  artery stenosis. Periprocedural risk stratification and management algorithms may
  decrease the risk of cardiovascular complications. SUMMARY: Cardiovascular abnormalities
  are a major determining factor in the clinical picture and trajectory of patients
  with Williams syndrome. Advances in surgical techniques, medical therapeutic options,
  and periprocedural management hold promise for significant improvements in the cardiovascular
  outcomes of these patients.'
