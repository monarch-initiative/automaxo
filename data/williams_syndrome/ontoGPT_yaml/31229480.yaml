input_text: "Long-term Surgical Prognosis of Primary Supravalvular Aortic Stenosis
  Repair. BACKGROUND: Supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) represents a heterogeneous
  group, including Williams syndrome, familial elastin arteriopathy, sporadic cases,
  and others. This study sought to evaluate long-term outcomes of SVAS repair. METHODS:
  A total of 87 patients underwent surgical repair of congenital SVAS at Boston Children's
  Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, between 1997 and 2017. A total of 41 patients
  had Williams syndrome, and 46 did not. Of the 46 patients who did not have Williams
  syndrome, 23 had sporadic SVAS, and 13 had familial elastin arteriopathy. Demographic
  data and outcomes were reviewed and analyzed from medical records. RESULTS: The
  median age at operation was 2.9 years. Mean z score of the sinotubular junction
  was -3.29 +- 1.42 and of the aortic root was -0.09 +- 1.19. A total of 26% (n =
  22) patients had coronary ostium stenosis, and 41% (n = 9) of them required patch
  plasty. Survival rates at 5, 10, and 20 years were all 94.3%. Freedom from left
  ventricular outflow tract reoperation at 5, 10, and 20 years was 78.5%, 70.3%, and
  70.3%, respectively. Freedom from aortic arch reintervention at 5, 10, and 20 years
  was 98.6%, 94.3%, 89.3%, respectively. In risk factors analysis, age younger than
  1 year, z scores of the aortic valve and aortic root, and concomitant right ventricular
  outflow tract surgical repair were predictive of the need for reoperation and reintervention
  for left or right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. CONCLUSIONS: Excellent
  long-term survival rates can be achieved with surgical repair of SVAS. Age younger
  than 1 year, small aortic valve and aortic root z scores, and concomitant right
  ventricular outflow tract surgical repair were predictors of reoperation and reintervention."
