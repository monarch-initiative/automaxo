input_text: Vesical prolapse in an apparently "normal" bladder. Bladder prolapse is
  extremely rare in children. Reports have been limited to pathologic bladder conditions
  such as the exstrophy-epispadias complex. We report an interesting presentation
  of bladder prolapse in a child with Williams syndrome with an apparently normal
  bladder.
