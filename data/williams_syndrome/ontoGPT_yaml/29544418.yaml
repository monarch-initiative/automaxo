input_text: 'Brom Aortoplasty for Supravalvular Aortic Stenosis. BACKGROUND: Controversy
  remains regarding the optimal surgical approach for children with supravalvular
  aortic stenosis (SVAS). METHODS: Since 1997 we have used Brom three-patch aortoplasty
  for patients with SVAS. We prefer computed tomography (CT) imaging for preoperative
  evaluation rather than cardiac catheterization as it avoids the well-known morbidity
  of general anesthesia. The purpose of this study was to present our intermediate-term
  results of this strategy. RESULTS: Twenty consecutive patients with SVAS were treated
  with Brom aortoplasty. Mean age was 3.7 +- 5.9 years (median, 1.5 years). Twelve
  patients had Williams syndrome. Ten patients had preoperative advanced medical imaging
  (seven CT, three magnetic resonance imaging) and did not have cardiac catheterization.
  Mean times for cardiopulmonary bypass and cross-clamp were 172 +- 29 minutes and
  110 +- 21 minutes, respectively. Ten patients had simultaneous pulmonary artery
  stenosis patching. Median length of stay was seven days. There was no operative
  or late mortality. Mean follow-up was 6 +- 5 years. There were no reoperations on
  the aortic root. Fifteen patients had mild or less aortic insufficiency (AI) and
  two had moderate AI. One patient who had infant balloon dilation of the aortic valve
  and postoperative subacute bacterial endocarditis had moderate-to-severe AI and
  aortic stenosis (AS). One patient had moderate residual SVAS; all others had no
  AS. No patients had late coronary insufficiency. CONCLUSION: Brom aortoplasty promotes
  restoration of normal aortic root geometry and relief of coronary ostial stenosis,
  which is important in preventing myocardial ischemia. Computed tomography imaging
  is our preferred diagnostic modality. Intermediate-term outcomes are excellent with
  no recurrent SVAS, coronary events, or reoperations on the aortic valve.'
