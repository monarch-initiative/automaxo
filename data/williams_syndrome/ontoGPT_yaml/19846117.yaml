input_text: 'Cardiovascular abnormalities, interventions, and long-term outcomes in
  infantile Williams syndrome. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of cardiovascular
  abnormalities (CVA) and outcomes in patients with Williams syndrome presenting before
  1 year of age. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective review was undertaken of consecutive
  patients with WS at our institution from January 1, 1980, through December 31, 2007.
  WS was diagnosed by an experienced medical geneticist and/or by fluorescence in
  situ hybridization. CVA were diagnosed with the use of echocardiography, cardiac
  catheterization, or computerized tomographic angiography. Freedom from intervention
  was determined using Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS: The study group was 129 patients
  with CVA. Age at presentation was 127 +/- 116 days, with follow-up of 8.0 +/- 7.5
  years (0 to 42 years). The most common lesions were peripheral pulmonary artery
  stenosis (62%) and supravalvar aortic stenosis (57%). Other CVA were common. CV
  interventions were performed in 29%, with 58% of those before 1 year. Freedom from
  intervention was 85%, 73%, and 66% at 1, 5, and 25 years, respectively. Four patients
  died. CONCLUSIONS: CVA are the most common manifestations of infantile Williams
  syndrome and occur with greater frequency than previously reported. In those with
  CVA, interventions are common and usually occur by 5 years of age. Most of these
  patients do not require intervention on long-term follow-up, and overall mortality
  is low.'
