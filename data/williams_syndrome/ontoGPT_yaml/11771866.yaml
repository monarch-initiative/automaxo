input_text: "Renovascular hypertension in children. OBJECTIVE: To study the etiology,
  clinical spectrum. image findings, management and outcome of children with renovascular
  hypertension (RVH). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty children (aged 5 days to 15 years)
  were studied and treated for RVH during 1977-1998. In 14 cases hypertension was
  found during a routine examination. Six cases had heart failure and/or hypertensive
  encephalopathy. Diagnosis was made with aortography. Post-captopril renography and
  Doppler ultrasonography were obtained in 8 patients and spiral computed tomography
  angiography in 2. Treatment consisted of surgery (8 patients), percutaneous transluminal
  angioplasty (PTA) (5) or antihypertensive drugs only (8). RESULTS: Initial blood
  pressure was 62 +/- 31 mmHg > 95th percentile for systolic and 44 +/- 22 mmHg for
  diastolic blood pressure. Twelve children had unilateral and 8 had bilateral arterial
  stenosis. In 3 cases lesions were intrarenal. RVH was due to fibromuscular dysplasia
  (7 patients) and associated to middle aortic syndrome (5). neurofibromatosis (3),
  William's syndrome (2). Takayasu's arteritis (1) and pheochromocytoma (1). Treatment
  of choice was decided depending on the size of the child and location and severity
  of the stenosis. At the end of the follow-up (78 +/- 49 months), 9 patients are
  normotensive without medication and 7 are normotensive with drugs. Three patients
  have died, 2 for unrelated causes and I for cardiac failure; 1 child was lost to
  the follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Although symptoms are relatively uncommon. renovascular
  disease is a frequent cause of severe hypertension in childhood. Non-invasive diagnostic
  techniques appear useful as screening methods. Treatment by surgery or PTA is successful
  if patients are carefully selected."
