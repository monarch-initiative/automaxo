input_text: "Stenosis of the thoracic aorta in Williams syndrome. Williams syndrome
  (WS) is a multisystem congenital disorder affecting 1/8000 live births. Our objective
  was to review our experience with stenosis of the thoracic aorta (STA) in these
  patients. A retrospective review was undertaken of consecutive WS patients at The
  Children's Hospital of Philadelphia from January 1, 1980, through December 31, 2007.
  WS was diagnosed by an experienced medical geneticist and/or by fluorescence in
  situ hybridization. Stenosis was diagnosed with either echocardiography or cardiac
  catheterization. Freedom from intervention was determined using Kaplan-Meier analysis.
  From a total cohort of 270 patients, 37 (14%) patients with STA were identified
  and comprised the study group. Age at presentation was 2.1 + or - 4.0 years, and
  follow-up was 11.8 + or - 12.6 years (range 0-51). Long-segment STA was more common
  (89%) than discrete STA. Severity of STA was mild in 18, moderate in 10, and severe
  in 9 patients. Branch pulmonary artery stenosis was seen in 62% (23 of 37) of STA
  patients, and supravalvar aortic stenosis was seen in 54% (20 of 37) STA patients.
  Nine (24%) patients underwent intervention for STA: 8 cases were severe, and 1 case
  was moderate. Restenosis resulting in reintervention occurred in 5 of 9 (56%) patients,
  with 4 of 5 (80%) patients undergoing multiple reinterventions. Freedom from intervention
  was 89, 82, and 73% at 1, 5, and 20 years, respectively. One patient died. STA is
  common in WS and is generally the long-segment type. In patients with STA, interventions
  are common and usually occur by 5 years of age. Reintervention for STA occurs frequently."
