input_text: Thoracolumbar syrinx in association with Williams syndrome. Williams syndrome
  is a genetic condition caused by a deletion on chromosome 7. Clinically it consists
  of multiple cardiovascular and craniofacial structural abnormalities as well as
  developmental delay, specific cognitive difficulties, and a characteristic personality.
  Although scoliosis is a noted manifestation of the disorder, syrinx in association
  with Williams syndrome has not been reported previously in the literature. Here
  we present the case of a child with Williams syndrome, scoliosis, and a thoracolumbar
  syrinx that was successfully treated surgically. We recommend that children with
  Williams syndrome and scoliosis undergo preoperative evaluation of the spinal cord,
  as well as the spinal column, so that correctable lesions such as a syrinx are not
  overlooked. Although syrinxes are often associated with scoliosis, the association
  in this case of syrinx and Williams syndrome could imply the existence of a genetic
  contribution to syrinx formation on chromosome 7.
