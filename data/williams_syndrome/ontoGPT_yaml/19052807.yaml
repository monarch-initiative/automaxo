input_text: 'Cardiac catheterization and operative outcomes from a multicenter consortium
  for children with williams syndrome. Williams syndrome is a multifaceted disorder
  that includes a spectrum of cardiovascular anomalies. Due to its rare occurrence,
  outcome data for operations and cardiac catheterization are limited. We reviewed
  data from 242 individuals from the Pediatric Cardiac Care Consortium (PCCC) with
  Williams syndrome and associated cardiovascular lesions, and their frequency, and
  assessed their effects on mortality. In the PCCC, from 1984 to 1999 there were approximately
  100,000 entries for cardiac procedures, involving more than 62,000 patients. The
  diagnosis of Williams syndrome was based on clinical features and determined by
  each site. Most patients were diagnosed with the availability of the FISH probe
  for region 7q11.23. Using a spreadsheet application, Microsoft Excel, the selected
  patients were analyzed for various types of cardiac anomalies. The most common cardiovascular
  lesions and the mortality rate in patients with Williams syndrome were examined.
  A complete tabulation of all cardiovascular lesions was assembled. There were 292
  catheterizations and 143 operations reported to the PCCC. One hundred six patients
  had both an operation and a catheterization. The three main cardiovascular anomalies
  were supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS; 169), pulmonary artery stenosis (PAS;
  130), and coarctation or aortic arch hypoplasia (Arch; 32). One hundred five patients
  had a single lesion, 70 with SVAS, 29 with PAS, and 6 with an arch anomaly. Ninety-two
  had more than one lesion: 80 with SVAS and PAS, 7 with PAS and Arch, and 5 with
  SVAS and Arch. Seventy individuals have only SVAS, 29 PAS, and 6 Arch alone. There
  was a total of 15 deaths. The mortality rate was highest in the group with the combination
  of SVAS and PAS (7 surgical and 5 catheter; 12 of 80 patients [15%]; p = 0.0001,
  chi(2)). In conclusion, our data represent the largest collection of individuals
  with Williams syndrome who underwent cardiac catheterization and/or operation. The
  data suggest that children with Williams syndrome and bilateral outflow tract obstruction
  have statistically and clinically significantly higher mortality associated with
  catheterization or operation.'
