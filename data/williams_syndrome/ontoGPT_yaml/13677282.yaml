input_text: '[Two occasions of anesthetic management for a patient with Williams syndrome].
  A 5-year-old boy with Williams syndrome received open reduction of fracture of the
  antebrachium twice. He had been diagnosed as having Williams syndrome with some
  characteristic symptoms, including elfin face, mental retardation and primary pulmonary
  hypertension. Williams syndrome has a tetrad of cardiovascular disease, elfin face,
  mental retardation and hypercalcemia. Operations were performed twice under general
  anesthesia. Airway management with mask technique was easily performed. Tracheal
  intubation was accomplished successfully. Anesthesia was induced with propofol,
  fentanyl, and vecuronium, and maintained with propofol, fentanyl and the inhalation
  of oxygen with nitrous oxide. Both anesthetic courses were uneventful and he was
  discharged without any complications. Special anesthetic considerations should be
  taken for difficulties of intubation, management of circulatory system, malignant
  hyperthermia, and hypercalcemia in this syndrome.'
