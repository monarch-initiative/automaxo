input_text: '[Intraoperative aortic injury caused by arterial perfusion cannula during
  extended aortoplasty in a patient with Williams syndrome]. An 8-year-old girl with
  Williams syndrome underwent repair of supravalvular aortic stenosis by extended
  aortoplasty (Doty technique). Although she was weaned from bypass successfully,
  direct epiaortic ultrasound scanning disclosed the acute luminal narrowing of the
  ascending aorta at the level of aortic cannulation. The perfusion was restarted
  through the tube graft anastomosed to the left carotid artery and the ascending
  aorta was cross-clamped. The longitudinal incision at the site of prior aortic cannulation
  disclosed the intramural hematoma at the posterior wall of the ascending aorta.
  The stenosis was repaired with the patch enlargement of the anterior wall. As the
  dysplastic wall of the ascending aorta in patients with this syndrome may be injured
  by arterial cannula, an appropriate positioning of the cannula is mandatory to lessen
  the risk of intimal injury.'
