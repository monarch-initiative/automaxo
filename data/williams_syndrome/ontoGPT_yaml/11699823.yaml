input_text: Treatment of hyperacusis in Williams syndrome with bilateral conductive
  hearing loss. Williams syndrome (WS) is a rather rare congenital disorder characterised
  by a series of cardiovascular, maxillo-facial and skeletal abnormalities. It sometimes
  displays otorhinolaryngological symptoms because of the relatively high incidence
  of secretory otitis media and hyperacusis, which may be present in up to 95% of
  patients. The present paper describes a case of WS associated with bilateral conductive
  hearing loss which was not related to secretory otitis media. Hyperacusis was, moreover,
  present in spite of the conductive deafness. Surgical or prosthetic treatment of
  hearing loss was delayed because of hyperacusis. Treatment of the hyperacusis by
  acoustic training, instead, yielded excellent, long-lasting remission of the symptoms.
