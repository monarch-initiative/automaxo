input_text: 'Risk assessment and anesthetic management of patients with Williams syndrome:
  a comprehensive review. Since the first description in 1961, several case reports
  have documented an increased incidence of anesthesia-related cardiac arrest in patients
  with Williams-Beuren syndrome, commonly known as Williams syndrome (WS). Widespread
  arteriopathy secondary to an elastin gene defect results in various cardiac defects,
  including supravalvar aortic stenosis (SVAS) and coronary artery anomalies, which
  can increase the risk of myocardial ischemia. Even though patients with WS are known
  to have increased risk of adverse events during anesthesia and sedation, they often
  undergo several procedures that require anesthesia during their lifetimes, and cases
  of perianesthetic cardiac arrest continue to be reported. To date, no prospective
  studies have been reported that quantify anesthetic risk in individual patients
  with WS. In this article, we review the clinical manifestations of WS, propose a
  consensus, expert-informed method to estimate anesthetic risk based on the current
  literature, and provide recommendations for periprocedural management of this patient
  population. '
