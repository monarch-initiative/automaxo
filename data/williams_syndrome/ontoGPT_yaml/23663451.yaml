input_text: "Abdominal coarctation and associated comorbidities in children. OBJECTIVE:
  The purpose of this study is to report a single institution's experience with abdominal
  coarctation in children and report associated comorbidities. BACKGROUND: Abdominal
  coarctation is a rare condition, accounting for less than 2% of aortic coarctations.
  Single patients with abdominal coarctation have been reported with additional vascular
  disease in pediatric patients. METHODS: Our echocardiography database between January
  2001 and January 2012 was searched to identify all patients with abdominal coarctation.
  Relevant clinical data were reviewed. RESULTS: Nine patients were identified with
  abdominal coarctation. Median age at diagnosis was 4.7 years (IQR 1.1-14.3 years).
  Additional cardiac diagnoses were found in three patients: one had moderate aortic
  regurgitation and aortic root dilatation; one had mild aortic regurgitation, severe
  mitral regurgitation, and atrial flutter; and one had a thoracic coarctation previously
  repaired. Eight patients (89%) had an associated noncardiac comorbidity. Comorbidities
  included: Takayasu arteritis (n = 3), systemic lupus erythematosus (n = 1), epidermal
  nevus syndrome (n = 1), abdominal hemangioma (n = 1), Williams syndrome (n = 1),
  and renal artery stenosis (n = 2). Intervention was performed in four patients (57%):
  two underwent surgical grafting and two had angioplasty with stent placement. Patients
  with surgical grafting required no further intervention, whereas both patients who
  underwent angioplasty and stenting required further stent placement. CONCLUSION:
  Abdominal coarctation is a rare anomaly. It is frequently associated with other
  vascular abnormalities. Vasculitis should be suspected in children with abdominal
  coarctation. All patients, even if treated, require continued close observation."
