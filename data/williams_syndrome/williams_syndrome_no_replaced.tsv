19822162	Cross-modal influences of affect across social and non-social domains in individuals with Williams syndrome.	The Williams syndrome (WS) cognitive profile is characterized by relative strengths in face processing, an attentional bias towards social stimuli, and an increased affinity and emotional reactivity to music. An audio-visual integration study examined the effects of auditory emotion on visual (social/non-social) affect identification in individuals with WS and typically developing (TD) and developmentally delayed (DD) controls. The social bias in WS was hypothesized to manifest as an increased ability to process social than non-social affect, and a reduced auditory influence in social contexts. The control groups were hypothesized to perform similarly across conditions. The results showed that while participants with WS exhibited indistinguishable performance to TD controls in identifying facial affect, DD controls performed significantly more poorly. The TD group outperformed the WS and DD groups in identifying non-social affect. The results suggest that emotionally evocative music facilitated the ability of participants with WS to process emotional facial expressions. These surprisingly strong facial-processing skills in individuals with WS may have been due to the effects of combining social and music stimuli and to a reduction in anxiety due to the music in particular. Several directions for future research are suggested.
35543661	Quality of life of Brazilian families who have children with Williams syndrome.	This cross-sectional and descriptive study examined the family quality of life (FQoL) among 72 Brazilian families who have children with Williams syndrome, a rare genetic disorder in which most individuals have an intellectual disability, usually mild. Data were collected using sociodemographic and clinical data forms and the Beach Center FQoL Scale. The overall FQoL score was 3.90 +- 0.45, below the limit of four points considered satisfactory. Families felt more satisfied with the family interaction (4.11 +- 0.57), parenting (4.07 +- 0.42), and disability-related support (3.94 +- 0.62) domains, and less satisfied with the family's emotional (3.49 +- 0.73) and physical/material well-being (3.73 +- 0.74) domains. Paternal education, children's cardiopathy and autonomy in activities of daily living explained 24.5% of the variance in the overall FQoL. Measures are necessary to improve the emotional and physical/material well-being of families to reduce the family burden. Monitoring the child's cardiac condition and promoting independence in activities of daily living are also the main procedures.
11331257	Balloon dilation angioplasty of peripheral pulmonary stenosis associated with Williams syndrome.	BACKGROUND: Experience of balloon dilation of peripheral pulmonary stenosis (PPS) in Williams syndrome (WS) is limited. METHODS AND RESULTS: Catheterizations in all patients with WS undergoing therapy for PPS from 1984 to 1999 were reviewed. Criteria for successful dilation included an increase >50% in predilation diameter and a decrease >20% in ratio of right ventricular (RV) to aortic (Ao) systolic pressure. Median age and weight were 1.5 years and 9.5 kg. There were 134 dilations during 39 procedures in 25 patients. The success rate for initial dilations was 51%. In multivariate analysis, successful dilation was more likely (1) in distal than in central pulmonary arteries (P=0.02), (2) if the balloon waist resolved with inflation (P=0.001), and (3) with larger balloon/stenosis ratio (P<0.001). RV pressure was unchanged after dilation (96+/-30 versus 97+/-31 mm Hg), primarily because of failure to enlarge central pulmonary arteries. The Ao pressure increased (102+/-14 versus 109+/-19 mm Hg, P=0.03), and the RV/Ao pressure ratio decreased (0.97+/-0.34 versus 0.91+/-0.30, P=0.05). Aneurysms developed after 24 dilations (18%) and were not related to balloon/stenosis ratio. Balloon rupture in 12 dilations produced an aneurysm in all 7 cases when rupture was in a hypoplastic segment. Three patients died, none from pulmonary artery trauma, and all before 1994. CONCLUSIONS: Mortality occurred early in our experience. Despite successful dilation of distal pulmonary arteries, there was modest initial hemodynamic improvement, mainly because of persistent central pulmonary artery obstruction. A serial approach of distal dilations followed by surgical repair of proximal obstruction may be a rational and successful therapy.
20717952	Perception of emotion in musical performance in adolescents with autism spectrum disorders.	Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are impaired in understanding the emotional undertones of speech, many of which are communicated through prosody. Musical performance also employs a form of prosody to communicate emotion, and the goal of this study was to examine the ability of adolescents with ASD to understand musical emotion. We designed an experiment in which each musical stimulus served as its own control while we varied the emotional expressivity by manipulating timing and amplitude variation. We asked children and adolescents with ASD and matched controls as well as individuals with Williams syndrome (WS) to rate how emotional these excerpts sounded. Results show that children and adolescents with ASD are impaired relative to matched controls and individuals with WS at judging the difference in emotionality among the expressivity levels. Implications for theories of emotion in autism are discussed in light of these findings.
30045083	Cardiovascular disease in Williams syndrome.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Williams syndrome is a multisystem disorder seen with some regularity at most pediatric centers and usually fairly often at larger centers. Cardiovascular abnormalities, because of elastin deficiency, are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with Williams syndrome. The present article presents a review of the most recent developments regarding the cardiovascular issues in Williams syndrome. RECENT FINDINGS: Cardiovascular abnormalities occur in 80% of patients with Williams syndrome, the majority of which are arterial stenoses. The stenoses seen in Williams syndrome now appear to arise from deficient circumferential arterial growth. Pharmacological therapies aimed at improving the vascular stenoses have shown some promise in animal models. Surgical outcomes for supravalvar aortic stenosis are good at most centers. Transcatheter interventions are largely ineffective in Williams syndrome. Multilevel surgical pulmonary artery reconstruction has excellent results for peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis. Periprocedural risk stratification and management algorithms may decrease the risk of cardiovascular complications. SUMMARY: Cardiovascular abnormalities are a major determining factor in the clinical picture and trajectory of patients with Williams syndrome. Advances in surgical techniques, medical therapeutic options, and periprocedural management hold promise for significant improvements in the cardiovascular outcomes of these patients.
11554073	[Effective use of electrolized soft acid aqueous solution for treatment of mediastinitis following cardiac surgery].	Mediastinitis following cardiac surgery occurs infrequently, but features both high mortality and morbidity, especially in patients with an artificial graft. A 24-year-old man was admitted with a diagnosis of Williams'syndrome with supraaortic stenosis. After ascending aorta and hemiarch reconstruction, mediastinitis developed, which was treated successfully with mediastinal irrigation using electrolized soft acid aqueous solution at one liter per day for 3 days. This procedure appears to be an effective method for treatment of mediastinitis following cardiac surgery.
26749433	Description of common musculoskeletal findings in Williams Syndrome and implications for therapies.	Williams syndrome (WS), also referred to as Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS), is a relatively rare genetic disorder affecting ~1/10,000 persons. Since the disorder is caused by a micro-deletion of ~1.5 Mb, it is not surprising that the manifestations of WS are extremely broad, involving most body systems. In this paper, we primarily focus on the musculoskeletal aspects of WS as these findings have not been the subject of a comprehensive review. We review the MSK features commonly seen in individuals with WS, along with related sensory and neurological issues interacting with and compounding underlying MSK abnormalities. We end by providing perspective, particularly from the vantage point of a physical therapist, on therapeutic interventions to address the most common MSK and related features seen in WS. Clin. Anat. 29:578-589, 2016.   2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. 
15812322	Global and local music perception in children with Williams syndrome.	Musical processing can be decomposed into the appreciation of global and local elements. This global/local dissociation was investigated with the processing of contour-violated and interval-violated melodies. Performance of a group of 16 children with Williams syndrome and a group of 16 control children were compared in a same-different task. Control participants were more accurate in detecting differences in the contour-violated than in the interval-violated condition while Williams syndrome individuals performed equally well in both conditions. This finding suggests that global precedence may occur at an early perceptual stage in normally developing children. In contrast, no such global precedence is observed in the Williams syndrome population. These data are discussed in the context of atypical cognitive profiles of individuals with Williams syndrome.
28589405	Drug-Coated Balloon Angioplasty: A Novel Treatment for Pulmonary Artery In-Stent Stenosis in a Patient with Williams Syndrome.	A 20-month-old boy with Williams syndrome had undergone multiple surgical and catheter-based interventions for resistant peripheral pulmonary arterial stenoses with eventual bilateral stent placement and conventional balloon angioplasty. He persistently developed suprasystemic right ventricular (RV) pressure. Angioplasty with a drug-coated balloon (DCB) was performed for in-stent restenosis and to remodel his distal pulmonary vessels bilaterally. This resulted in immediate improvement in the in-stent stenosis and resultant decrease in RV pressure. Follow-up catheterization two months later continued to show long-lasting improvement in the in-stent stenosis. We hypothesize that the anti-proliferative effects of DCBs may be of benefit in the arteriopathy associated with Williams syndrome. We report this as a novel use of a DCB in the pulmonary arterial circulation in a patient with Williams syndrome.
12529452	The impact of developmental visuospatial learning difficulties on British Sign Language.	There has been substantial research interest in recent years in the relationship between the development of language and cognition, especially where dissociations can be seen between them. Williams syndrome, a rare congenital disorder characterized by a fractionation of higher cortical functions, with relatively preserved language but marked difficulties with visuospatial constructive cognition, has been extensively studied. The case of Heather, who is remarkably similar to the characteristic phenotype of Williams syndrome in physical appearance and cognitive abilities, but who is also congenitally deaf and a user of British Sign Language, provides the first opportunity to explore the consequences of specific visuospatial learning difficulties on the linguistic system when the language used is visuospatial. Heather shows a pattern of impaired drawing ability and visual form discrimination, but preserved ability to discriminate faces. She has a large vocabulary in British Sign Language, and overall presents a picture of relative competence in British Sign Language grammar. However, she shows specific deficits in those areas of British Sign Language which directly rely on spatial representations for linguistic purposes. A number of theories as to the nature of her impairments and those found in Williams syndrome are discussed, using models of the relationship between language and visuospatial cognition based on data from this unique case.
19740193	A case report of rapid progressive coarctation and severe middle aortic syndrome in an infant with Williams syndrome.	Williams syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by multiple contiguous gene deletions in chromosome 7. Presentation in early life is most often a result of luminal stenosis of right- and left-sided arterial vasculature. We report the case of a newborn infant who had a rapidly progressing diffuse form of arteriopathy that required two surgeries and one percutaneous balloon dilation within the first 2 months of her life.
11931944	Audiovisual speech perception in Williams syndrome.	People with the genetic disorder of Williams syndrome (WS) show an anomalous cognitive profile, wherein some purely verbal and social communicative abilities are relatively proficient, while visuo-spatial skills can be extremely impaired. Face processing, while apparently relatively spared among visuo-spatial skills, can show deficits suggesting developmental immaturity. In this context, the exploration of visual and audiovisual speech perception in WS is of interest. A new test based on tokens from a single natural English speaker of the form /(inverted v)ba:/, /(inverted v) va:/, /(inverted v)(theta)a:/, /(inverted v)da:/ and /(inverted v)ga:/, digitally manipulated and presented in unimodal (vision alone, audition alone) and audiovisual conditions, was presented for participants to identify each token. Compared with age-matched controls, WS participants were impaired at visual but not auditory identification, and in audiovisual testing showed correspondingly reduced effects of vision on report of auditory token identity. Audiovisual integration was nevertheless demonstrable in WS. Speech-reading may require skills which do not reach age-appropriate levels in WS, despite their age-appropriate (auditory) phonological abilities.
33040742	Acute aortic dissection in a patient with Williams syndrome infected by COVID-19.	Cardiovascular involvement in COVID-19 has different features. Here we report the ominous fate of a neglected adolescent with Williams syndrome that was infected by SARS-CoV-2 and ended by acute aortic dissection.
33337781	Outcomes of an 8-Week Treadmill Training Program for a Toddler With Williams Syndrome: A Case Report.	PURPOSE: This case report highlights the functional and quality-of-life outcomes of an 8-week treadmill training program for an 18-month old child with Williams syndrome who is not walking. SUMMARY OF KEY POINTS: The child had clinical improvements in gross motor function and quality of life as determined by the Gross Motor Function Measure and Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory after 8 weeks of treadmill training as an outpatient. STATEMENT OF CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE: Treadmill training is clinically feasible and effective for this child with Williams syndrome. Further research is necessary for generalizability. Treadmill training should be considered when developing a plan of care for children with Williams syndrome who are not walking or children with similar deficits.
15103608	Bladed balloon angioplasty for peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis.	Treatment for peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis is challenging, and conventional balloon angioplasty has not proved to be universally effective. Evaluated was the efficacy of bladed balloon (BB) dilation to address vessels resistant to conventional high-pressure (10-15 atm) balloon angioplasty (BA). Thirty-one procedures were performed on 14 children with age range 1 month to 15 years. The diameter of the BB ranged from 3 to 8 mm. After BB dilation, all children had subsequent conventional BA (balloon size range, 3-10 mm). The minimal lumen diameter (MLD) before and after the procedure, whether there was a waist at initial BA, and BB diameter-to-MLD ratio before the procedure were measured. A > 50% increase in MLD was considered successful. Four children had Williams syndrome, two children Alagille syndrome, five children Fallot's tetralogy, and three miscellaneous lesions. The resistant stenosis was located in the right central pulmonary artery in 6, right branch pulmonary artery in 7, left central pulmonary artery in 6, and left branch pulmonary artery in 12 lesions. Median BB diameter was 253% (117-440%) of the MLD and increased from 2.0 +/- 0.7 to 3.2 +/- 0.8 mm (P < 0.0001), with a mean increase of 73% +/- 62%. There was an inverse relationship between the MLD before and increase after the procedure (r = 0.75; P < 0.001). The BB diameter-to-MLD ratio before procedure was significantly associated with the increase in MLD (r = 0.70; P < 0.001). After the procedure, 18 of the 31 procedures were considered successful. In all successful procedures, the BB diameter was greater than twice the MLD before the procedure. Comparing children with Williams and Alagille syndrome with the remaining eight children, there were no significant differences in the increase in MLD. A small aneurysm and thrombus were noticed in two and three children, respectively, but no fatal complications were reported. BB angioplasty is effective for resistant peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis when conventional BA fails. The diameter of the BB should be larger than twice the minimal luminal diameter of the stenotic lesion.
12760588	Supravalvar aortic stenosis: clinical and hemodynamic profile, and surgical outcome.	BACKGROUND: Supravalvar aortic stenosis is the rarest of left ventricular outflow obstructions. Data on this rare entity from India are scarce. METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively analyzed the data of 15 patients (13 males, mean age 15.5+/-10.18 years) with a diagnosis of supravalvar aortic stenosis confirmed by cardiac catheterization. Five patients had morphological features of Williams' syndrome. One patient had diffuse while the rest had discrete type of supravalvar aortic stenosis. Five patients did not have any associated lesions. A 9-year-old male had an ascending aortic aneurysm, and 3 patients had associated peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis. One child had a subaortic ventricular septal defect, and another had severe mitral regurgitation. Twelve patients had electrocardiographic evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy. Three patients had mild aortic valvar stenosis while 2 had aortic regurgitation. Six patients had dilated coronary arteries. Two patients with supravalvar aortic gradients of 20 and 40 mmHg were kept on close follow-up. One patient was not willing to undergo surgery while the other is awaiting surgery. Eleven patients underwent surgical correction. Dacron or pericardial patch aortoplasty was done in all the patients. In addition, one patient each underwent pulmonary artery plasty, ventricular septal defect closure, repair of ascending aortic aneurysm, and mitral valve replacement. The patient with diffuse type of supravalvar aortic stenosis underwent augmentation aortoplasty. Two patients died perioperatively. One was lost to follow-up. Two had moderate residual gradients. The rest of the patients were in New York Heart Association functional class I on follow-up of 6.3+/-4.7 years. CONCLUSIONS: Repair of supravalvar aortic stenosis by single sinus aortoplasty is safe and produces good results.
10798276	[Congenital tubular supravalvular aortic stenosis with massive coronary artery dilatation in a 35-year-old man].	Supravalvular aortic stenosis is a rare cause of left ventricular outflow obstruction in adults. It occurs as an isolated defect sporadically or on a hereditary basis with an autosomal dominant trait without further phenotypical anomalies, or as part of the Williams syndrome with mental retardation and multiple other anomalies. This lesion was proved to result from a defect of the elastin coding gene. Supravalvular aortic stenosis is frequently associated with cardiovascular defects, particularly of the peripheral pulmonary arteries, thoracic aorta, carotid, subclavian, and coronary arteries and the aortic valve. The coronary arteries are subject to an increased perfusion pressure leading to dilatation, tortuosity and accelerated arteriosclerosis. We give details of a 35-year-old patient in whom a previously asymptomatic supravalvular aortic stenosis is associated with an excessive dilatation of the right coronary artery and the left anterior descending coronary artery as well as an ostium stenosis of the left common carotid artery. The patient did not present any phenotypical anomalies of the Williams syndrome.
31229480	Long-term Surgical Prognosis of Primary Supravalvular Aortic Stenosis Repair.	BACKGROUND: Supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) represents a heterogeneous group, including Williams syndrome, familial elastin arteriopathy, sporadic cases, and others. This study sought to evaluate long-term outcomes of SVAS repair. METHODS: A total of 87 patients underwent surgical repair of congenital SVAS at Boston Children's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, between 1997 and 2017. A total of 41 patients had Williams syndrome, and 46 did not. Of the 46 patients who did not have Williams syndrome, 23 had sporadic SVAS, and 13 had familial elastin arteriopathy. Demographic data and outcomes were reviewed and analyzed from medical records. RESULTS: The median age at operation was 2.9 years. Mean z score of the sinotubular junction was -3.29 +- 1.42 and of the aortic root was -0.09 +- 1.19. A total of 26% (n = 22) patients had coronary ostium stenosis, and 41% (n = 9) of them required patch plasty. Survival rates at 5, 10, and 20 years were all 94.3%. Freedom from left ventricular outflow tract reoperation at 5, 10, and 20 years was 78.5%, 70.3%, and 70.3%, respectively. Freedom from aortic arch reintervention at 5, 10, and 20 years was 98.6%, 94.3%, 89.3%, respectively. In risk factors analysis, age younger than 1 year, z scores of the aortic valve and aortic root, and concomitant right ventricular outflow tract surgical repair were predictive of the need for reoperation and reintervention for left or right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. CONCLUSIONS: Excellent long-term survival rates can be achieved with surgical repair of SVAS. Age younger than 1 year, small aortic valve and aortic root z scores, and concomitant right ventricular outflow tract surgical repair were predictors of reoperation and reintervention.
34110668	Cutting balloon angioplasty on branch pulmonary artery stenosis in pediatric patients.	OBJECTIVES: To identify medium-term results following cutting balloon angioplasty (CBA) for branch pulmonary artery stenosis (PAS) and predictors of successful intervention. BACKGROUND: CBA has emerged as a successful alternative therapy for PAS resistant to conventional balloon angioplasty techniques but there is little information on medium and long-term outcomes. METHODS: This is a descriptive, single center, retrospective chart review of pediatric patients who underwent CBA for PAS at Arkansas Children's Hospital between May 2005 and December 2020. We reviewed demographics, procedural specifics, and 30-day complications. RESULTS: Forty-four patients underwent pulmonary artery CBA on 114 pulmonary artery segments through 126 catheterization cases, totaling 148 CBA events. Thirty-three individual pulmonary arteries underwent repeat intervention. Average minimal luminal diameter increase from pre-CBA to end of follow-up was 57% (CI, 38%-75%). Absence of Tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia and major aortopulmonary collateral arteries (TOF/PA/MAPCAs) and the absence of Alagille Syndrome, Williams Syndrome, or Arterial Tortuosity Syndrome (ATS) were associated with increased odds of sustained success by 70% (CI, 0.11-0.79) and 91% (CI, 0.02-0.56), respectively. Increasing the cutting balloon diameter-to-minimal luminal diameter ratio by 0.5 increased odds of successful intervention by 2.37-fold (CI, 1.7-3.3). Seven patients had 30-day complications including one death. CONCLUSIONS: In the longest follow-up to date of children and adolescents who underwent CBA for branch PAS, we found that there was moderate medium-term success. Additionally, absence of TOF/PA/MAPCAs, absence of Alagille Syndrome, Williams Syndrome, or ATS, and high cutting balloon diameter-to-minimal luminal diameter ratio are predictors of sustained results.

20486579	[Tracheal intubation in patients with Williams syndrome].	Williams syndrome is caused by the deletion of genetic material from chromosome 7, including the elastin gene. Affected individuals frequently have connective tissue disorders and skeletal hypoplasia, resulting in micrognathia and mandibular retrusion. These conditions hinder adequate visualization of the larynx and render intubation difficult. We used different methods of tracheal intubation for two patients with Williams syndrome. The first case was a 35-year-old woman with micrognathia, mandibular retrusion, and a Mallampati class III airway, scheduled for mitral valve replacement. She had a three fingerbreadth oral aperture, 3.0 cm mandibulohyoid distance, and 30 degree neck flexion. Since she had previously been successfully intubated at age 18 for patch enlargement of the aorta and extended aortoplasty, we elected to use intravenous anesthetic agents for this intubation. After administration of diazepam and fentanyl, mask ventilation was difficult and the direct laryngoscopic view was Cormack grade IV. Fortunately, blind orotracheal intubation using a Mallinckrodt tracheal tube with direct laryngoscopy was accomplished on the first attempt. The second case was a 71-year-old woman with micrognathia, slight mandibular retrusion, macroglossia, and a Mallampati class IV airway, scheduled for sigmoidectomy and insertion of a ureteral stent. She had a 2.5 fingerbreadth oral aperture, 4.0 cm mandibulohyoid distance, and 30 degree neck flexion. From our experience with the first patient, we expected difficult ventilation and intubation. After 8% lidocaine spray to the larynx, and then 4% lidocaine spray to the vocal cords and trachea using a bronchoscope, we accomplished awake, fibreoptic-guided orotracheal intubation easily and quickly on the first attempt using a Parker Flex-Tip tube. Difficult tracheal intubation should be anticipated in Williams syndrome patients. Awake, fibreoptic-guided technique is easier and safer than direct laryngoscopy for intubating such patients.
23540732	Isolated cervical spinal canal stenosis at C-1 in the pediatric population and in Williams syndrome.	OBJECT: Isolated cervical canal stenosis at the level of the atlas (C-1) is a rare cause of cervical myelopathy in the pediatric population. It has been associated with several genetic disorders including spondyloepiphysial dysplasia congenita, Down syndrome, and Klippel-Feil syndrome. The purpose of this study is to highlight the authors' experience with 4 additional pediatric cases, review the literature, and report a new association of this disease with Williams syndrome. METHODS: The medical records and radiological imaging studies of 4 patients treated at Texas Children's Hospital for symptomatic hypoplasia of the atlas were retrospectively reviewed. Pertinent patient demographic data, clinical presentation, imaging findings, and outcomes after surgery were recorded. A thorough literature review was performed, allowing the authors to compare and contrast their 4 cases to surgical cases already published in the literature. RESULTS: There were 11 boys and 1 girl in the aggregate series. The average age of the patients was 7 years (range 13 months-14 years), and the duration of symptoms prior to presentation was 6 months (range 0-36 months). The mean sagittal diameter of the spinal canal at the level of the atlas measured from the posterior aspect of the dens to the anterior aspect of the arch of C-1 was 11.9 mm (range 8.3-16 mm) in the aggregate series. In 2 new pediatric patients with hypoplasia of the atlas the disease was associated with Williams syndrome, which has not been previously described. Patients in the aggregate series were followed for an average of 18 months (range 3-50 months). Laminectomy of C-1 provided neurological improvement in all patients who presented. CONCLUSIONS: Isolated cervical spinal canal stenosis at the level of the atlas is a rare cause of cervical myelopathy. The authors hope that this report will prompt clinicians to consider it when searching for the origin of signs and symptoms of cervical myelopathy, especially in children.
11003759	Surgery for bilateral outflow tract obstruction in elastin arteriopathy.	OBJECTIVE: A number of patients with Williams syndrome or other forms of elastin arteriopathy have stenoses of pulmonary arteries in addition to supravalvular aortic stenosis. We sought to investigate the effect of the degree of pulmonary arterial stenosis on the prognosis after an operation for supravalvular aortic stenosis to help define the optimal treatment strategy for patients with severe forms of elastin arteriopathy. METHODS: Between 1960 and 1999, 33 patients underwent operations for supravalvular aortic stenosis while having significant stenoses of the pulmonary arteries. We retrospectively reviewed patient charts, obtained current follow-up information, and determined risk factors for survival and reoperation. RESULTS: Fifteen patients with moderate right-sided obstructions (confirmed by pulmonary artery Z-scores and right ventricular/descending aortic pressure ratio) underwent operations for supravalvular aortic stenosis only. Eighteen patients had more severe right-sided obstructions and underwent surgical relief of pulmonary arterial stenoses or right ventricular outflow tract obstruction in addition to operations for supravalvular aortic stenosis. Eight patients had undergone preoperative balloon dilations of stenotic pulmonary arteries. There were 6 early deaths and 1 late death in our series. Survival at 10 and 20 years was 76% (70% confidence interval, 68%-84%) and freedom from reintervention was 59% (70% confidence interval, 46%-71%) at 10 years and 49% (70% confidence interval, 35%-62%) at 20 years. Multivariate analysis revealed that patients with a right ventricular/descending aortic pressure ratio of 1.0 or more were at higher risk for reintervention but not for death. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical treatment of pulmonary artery obstructions in elastin arteriopathy is palliative but, in conjunction with balloon dilation of peripheral pulmonary arteries, offers good long-term survival to patients with the severest form of elastin arteriopathy.
17184571	Isolated obstruction of the right ventricular infundibulum in a patient with Williams' syndrome.	Williams' syndrome is a rare condition that is associated with severe cardiovascular manifestations. We report a patient with Williams' syndrome who also has isolated obstruction of the right ventricular infundibulum, an association that, to the best of our knowledge, has not been previously reported.
16403203	Outcome in adult life for people with Williams syndrome-- results from a survey of 239 families.	BACKGROUND: Although there has been considerable research into the genotype and phenotype of Williams syndrome, there have been relatively few studies of long-term prognosis. As a preliminary to a more detailed investigation of adults with Williams syndrome, a parental questionnaire was distributed to members of the UK Williams Syndrome Foundation, focusing on areas of skill and difficulties in adult life. METHOD: A postal questionnaire was distributed to all members of the UK Williams Syndrome Foundation who had a son or daughter aged 18 years or over. The questionnaire covered issues related to the physical and mental health of the adults with Williams syndrome, together with questions about educational and employment status, self-help and independence skills. RESULTS: Out of a total of 290 questionnaires distributed, 239 were returned (82% response rate). The data highlighted the continuing high rates of physical problems in this group and apparent increases in rates of mental health problems with age. Parents also expressed their concerns about the lack of adequate support and care. Educational and employment attainments were generally low and self-help skills were relatively poor. DISCUSSION: The findings highlight the need for far better understanding of conditions such as Williams syndrome among professionals working in adult services and the need for more adequate support from educational, health and social services.
11246716	Adaptive behavior of 4- through 8-year-old children with Williams syndrome.	The adaptive behavior of forty-one 4- through 8-year-olds with Williams syndrome was assessed using the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-Interview Edition. Based on the cognitive and personality profiles characteristic of children with this syndrome, we predicted that the domains of Socialization and Communication would be relative strengths, whereas Daily Living Skills and Motor Skills would be relative weaknesses. We also expected that Socialization Skills would be more advanced than Communication skills, and that within the Socialization domain, interpersonal skills would be stronger than play/leisure or coping skills. All predictions were confirmed. Adaptive behavior standard score was not related to CA. The children earned similar overall standard scores on the Vineland and the Differential Ability Scales. Interrelations among adaptive behavior, cognitive abilities, and personality characteristics are discussed.
29246395	Cardiac arrest related to anaesthesia in Williams-Beuren syndrome.	Williams-Beuren syndrome is the clinical manifestation of a congenital genetic disorder in the elastin gene, among others. There is a history of cardiac arrest refractory to resuscitation manoeuvres in anaesthesia. The incidence of myocardial ischaemia is high during anaesthetic induction, but there are patients who do not have this condition yet also have had very serious cardiac events, and issues that are still to be resolved. Case descriptions will enable the common pathophysiological factors to be defined, and decrease morbidity and mortality. We report the case of a 3-year-old boy with cardiac arrest at induction, rescued with circulatory assistance with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and hypothermia induced for cerebral protection.
11771866	Renovascular hypertension in children.	OBJECTIVE: To study the etiology, clinical spectrum. image findings, management and outcome of children with renovascular hypertension (RVH). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty children (aged 5 days to 15 years) were studied and treated for RVH during 1977-1998. In 14 cases hypertension was found during a routine examination. Six cases had heart failure and/or hypertensive encephalopathy. Diagnosis was made with aortography. Post-captopril renography and Doppler ultrasonography were obtained in 8 patients and spiral computed tomography angiography in 2. Treatment consisted of surgery (8 patients), percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) (5) or antihypertensive drugs only (8). RESULTS: Initial blood pressure was 62 +/- 31 mmHg > 95th percentile for systolic and 44 +/- 22 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure. Twelve children had unilateral and 8 had bilateral arterial stenosis. In 3 cases lesions were intrarenal. RVH was due to fibromuscular dysplasia (7 patients) and associated to middle aortic syndrome (5). neurofibromatosis (3), William's syndrome (2). Takayasu's arteritis (1) and pheochromocytoma (1). Treatment of choice was decided depending on the size of the child and location and severity of the stenosis. At the end of the follow-up (78 +/- 49 months), 9 patients are normotensive without medication and 7 are normotensive with drugs. Three patients have died, 2 for unrelated causes and I for cardiac failure; 1 child was lost to the follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Although symptoms are relatively uncommon. renovascular disease is a frequent cause of severe hypertension in childhood. Non-invasive diagnostic techniques appear useful as screening methods. Treatment by surgery or PTA is successful if patients are carefully selected.
16476938	Hyperacusis in Williams syndrome: characteristics and associated neuroaudiologic abnormalities.	BACKGROUND: Hyperacusis and phonophobia are common, debilitating symptoms in Williams syndrome (WS), yet little is known about their underlying audiologic and neurologic processes. METHODS: The mothers of 49 subjects with WS were asked to complete the Hyperacusis Screening Questionnaire. Subjects with reported hyperacusis and sufficient developmental capacity underwent comprehensive audiological and brain auditory evoked response (BAER) testing. Findings were compared with those from pair-matched typically developing control subjects. RESULTS: Forty-one of the 49 children with WS (84%) had hyperacusis of moderate to severe degree, which began in infancy. Of these, 21 (mean age 15.8 +/- 5.5 years) were quantitatively tested. Subjects with WS reported discomfort at sound intensities on average 20 dB lower than control subjects. Pure-tone audiometry and distortion products otoacoustic emission test revealed a high-frequency cochlear hearing loss. An absence of ipsilateral acoustic reflex responses to maximum stimulation was significantly more common in the subjects with WS than controls. On BAER testing, the WS group had a significant prolongation in wave I latency. CONCLUSIONS: Hyperacusis in Williams syndrome (WS) is associated with a high-frequency hearing loss resembling the configuration of noise-induced hearing loss. The hyperacusis and hearing loss in WS may stem from a deficiency in the acoustic reflex resulting from auditory nerve dysfunction. Additional mechanisms that may mediate hyperacusis in WS and should be evaluated in future studies include recruitment, malformation of the facial canal, and haploinsufficiency of the elastin gene.
30530430	Intractable apnoeic seizures in a child with a deletion typically associated with Williams syndrome.	Williams-Beuren syndrome is rarely associated with epilepsy. One previously reported case showed an association with apnoeic seizures while a few other cases showed an association with infantile epileptic spasms and generalized and focal seizures. We report the case of a 13-month-old boy with a deletion typically associated with Williams-Beuren syndrome, who presented with isolated apnoeic seizures which were refractory to multiple antiepileptic drugs but partially responsive to the ketogenic diet. The diagnosis was challenging due to a complex cardiac history, gastroesophageal reflux, and normal interictal EEG findings. This case highlights the importance of prolonged EEG monitoring in suspected cases of apnoeic seizures. Further, given the reported cases of unexplained sudden death in Williams-Beuren syndrome, this case raises the possibility of an association between apnoeic seizures and unexplained sudden death.

27506644	Parent and Self-Report Ratings on the Perceived Levels of Social Vulnerability of Adults with Williams Syndrome.	The current study took a multi-informant approach to compare parent to self-report ratings of social vulnerability of adults with Williams syndrome (WS). Participants included 102 pairs of adults with WS and their parents. Parents completed the Social Vulnerability Questionnaire and adults with WS completed an adapted version of the questionnaire. Parents consistently reported higher levels of social vulnerability for their son/daughter than the individual with WS reported, with the exception of emotional abuse. The lower ratings of social vulnerability by adults with WS, compared to their parents, offer new information about their insight into their own vulnerability. These findings highlight the importance of teaching self-awareness as a part of a multi-informant approach to interventions designed to target social vulnerability.
31321842	Shared and syndrome-specific adaptive difficulties in preschoolers with Williams syndrome and autism spectrum disorder: a cross-syndrome study.	BACKGROUND: Understanding adaptive functioning profiles in children with Williams syndrome (WS) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is critical to inform treatment strategies. However, knowledge in this area is limited and inconclusive. METHOD: The current study aimed to characterise the early adaptive profiles of young children with WS (n = 18; Mage = 47 months) and ASD (n = 26; Mage = 45 months) matched on chronological age and developmental age using the Vineland Scales of Adaptive Behavior, Second Edition. RESULTS: Results suggest that young children with WS and ASD do not differ on their overall level of adaptive functioning but that those with WS show relative strengths in the Socialisation scale compared with children with ASD. No other subscales differed between groups. Within groups, the WS group showed a profile of Communication, Daily Living Skills and Motor < Socialisation, whereas the ASD group did not evidence differences across subscales. CONCLUSIONS: Consideration of the shared and syndrome-specific adaptive profiles provides relevant insight on intervention targets and strategies. Given the shared challenges across the two clinical groups, implications and future directions are discussed.
20969939	Cochlear active mechanisms in young normal-hearing subjects affected by Williams syndrome: time-frequency analysis of otoacoustic emissions.	The aim of this study was to investigate the functionality of cochlear active mechanisms in normal-hearing subjects affected by Williams syndrome (WS). Transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs) were recorded in a group of young WS subjects and a group of typically developing control subjects, all having normal-hearing thresholds and normal middle-ear functionality. We also analysed the narrow-band frequency components of TEOAEs, extracted from the broad-band TEOAE recordings by using a time-frequency analysis algorithm based on the Wavelet transform. We observed that TEOAEs and the frequency components extracted from TEOAEs measured in WS subjects had significantly lower energy compared to the controls. Also, the narrow-band frequency components of TEOAEs measured in WS subjects had slightly increased latency compared to the controls. Overall, results would suggest a subtle (i.e., sub-clinical) dysfunction of the cochlear active mechanisms in WS subjects with otherwise normal hearing. Also, results point out the relevance of using otoacoustic emissions in the audiological evaluation and monitoring of WS subjects to early identify possible subtle auditory dysfunctions, before the onset of mild or moderate hearing loss that could exacerbate language or cognitive impairments associated with WS.
20097042	Health and social outcomes in adults with Williams syndrome: findings from cross-sectional and longitudinal cohorts.	Previous studies have investigated trajectories of cognitive, language and adaptive functioning in Williams syndrome (WS) but little is known about how other aspects of the Williams syndrome behavioural phenotype change across the life-span. Therefore, the present study examined age associated changes in a number of different domains of functioning in adults with WS. Semi-structured interviews and standardized assessments of physical health, educational and occupational levels, self-care and independence, social interactions, and behavioural difficulties were conducted with adults with WS and their parents/carers. Ninety-two individuals with genetic confirmation of WS (50 males, 42 females) participated in a cross-sectional study (age range 19-55 years; mean 32 years) and 43 individuals (21 males, 22 females) were involved in a longitudinal study as they had taken part in a previous study of adults with WS. Not all individuals in the longitudinal cohort had genetically confirmed WS. Cross-sectional analyses revealed no age related differences in the areas of functioning investigated. However, in the longitudinal sample, significant improvements were reported in physical health, self-care and occupational skills. Social skills and adaptive behaviours had generally improved while behavioural difficulties had declined. In both cross-sectional and longitudinal cohorts there were significant correlations between adaptive functioning and IQ. These findings are consistent in indicating no age related decline in social or adaptive functioning in adults with WS, at least up to the age of 50-55 years.
18082682	Vesical prolapse in an apparently "normal" bladder.	Bladder prolapse is extremely rare in children. Reports have been limited to pathologic bladder conditions such as the exstrophy-epispadias complex. We report an interesting presentation of bladder prolapse in a child with Williams syndrome with an apparently normal bladder.
29544418	Brom Aortoplasty for Supravalvular Aortic Stenosis.	BACKGROUND: Controversy remains regarding the optimal surgical approach for children with supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS). METHODS: Since 1997 we have used Brom three-patch aortoplasty for patients with SVAS. We prefer computed tomography (CT) imaging for preoperative evaluation rather than cardiac catheterization as it avoids the well-known morbidity of general anesthesia. The purpose of this study was to present our intermediate-term results of this strategy. RESULTS: Twenty consecutive patients with SVAS were treated with Brom aortoplasty. Mean age was 3.7 +- 5.9 years (median, 1.5 years). Twelve patients had Williams syndrome. Ten patients had preoperative advanced medical imaging (seven CT, three magnetic resonance imaging) and did not have cardiac catheterization. Mean times for cardiopulmonary bypass and cross-clamp were 172 +- 29 minutes and 110 +- 21 minutes, respectively. Ten patients had simultaneous pulmonary artery stenosis patching. Median length of stay was seven days. There was no operative or late mortality. Mean follow-up was 6 +- 5 years. There were no reoperations on the aortic root. Fifteen patients had mild or less aortic insufficiency (AI) and two had moderate AI. One patient who had infant balloon dilation of the aortic valve and postoperative subacute bacterial endocarditis had moderate-to-severe AI and aortic stenosis (AS). One patient had moderate residual SVAS; all others had no AS. No patients had late coronary insufficiency. CONCLUSION: Brom aortoplasty promotes restoration of normal aortic root geometry and relief of coronary ostial stenosis, which is important in preventing myocardial ischemia. Computed tomography imaging is our preferred diagnostic modality. Intermediate-term outcomes are excellent with no recurrent SVAS, coronary events, or reoperations on the aortic valve.
23663451	Abdominal coarctation and associated comorbidities in children.	OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to report a single institution's experience with abdominal coarctation in children and report associated comorbidities. BACKGROUND: Abdominal coarctation is a rare condition, accounting for less than 2% of aortic coarctations. Single patients with abdominal coarctation have been reported with additional vascular disease in pediatric patients. METHODS: Our echocardiography database between January 2001 and January 2012 was searched to identify all patients with abdominal coarctation. Relevant clinical data were reviewed. RESULTS: Nine patients were identified with abdominal coarctation. Median age at diagnosis was 4.7 years (IQR 1.1-14.3 years). Additional cardiac diagnoses were found in three patients: one had moderate aortic regurgitation and aortic root dilatation; one had mild aortic regurgitation, severe mitral regurgitation, and atrial flutter; and one had a thoracic coarctation previously repaired. Eight patients (89%) had an associated noncardiac comorbidity. Comorbidities included: Takayasu arteritis (n = 3), systemic lupus erythematosus (n = 1), epidermal nevus syndrome (n = 1), abdominal hemangioma (n = 1), Williams syndrome (n = 1), and renal artery stenosis (n = 2). Intervention was performed in four patients (57%): two underwent surgical grafting and two had angioplasty with stent placement. Patients with surgical grafting required no further intervention, whereas both patients who underwent angioplasty and stenting required further stent placement. CONCLUSION: Abdominal coarctation is a rare anomaly. It is frequently associated with other vascular abnormalities. Vasculitis should be suspected in children with abdominal coarctation. All patients, even if treated, require continued close observation.
11699823	Treatment of hyperacusis in Williams syndrome with bilateral conductive hearing loss.	Williams syndrome (WS) is a rather rare congenital disorder characterised by a series of cardiovascular, maxillo-facial and skeletal abnormalities. It sometimes displays otorhinolaryngological symptoms because of the relatively high incidence of secretory otitis media and hyperacusis, which may be present in up to 95% of patients. The present paper describes a case of WS associated with bilateral conductive hearing loss which was not related to secretory otitis media. Hyperacusis was, moreover, present in spite of the conductive deafness. Surgical or prosthetic treatment of hearing loss was delayed because of hyperacusis. Treatment of the hyperacusis by acoustic training, instead, yielded excellent, long-lasting remission of the symptoms.
19025031	Hyperactive auditory efferent system and lack of acoustic reflexes in Williams syndrome.	The auditory efferent system and acoustic reflexes have been investigated in patients with Williams syndrome (WS). Twenty-one patients aged 6-26 years with a genetically confirmed diagnosis of WS and with reported hyperacusis were compared with 21 normally developing age-matched subjects. The medial olivocochlear (MOC) efferent system was tested by stimulation of the contralateral ear with increasing levels of white noise, while recording transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE) in the ipsilateral ear. The suppression effect on the amplitudes of the TEOAE was computed for each contralateral stimulus level. This measure reflects the strength of the MOC efferent system. In addition, the thresholds of ipsilateral and contralateral acoustic reflexes in response to 1, 2 and 4 kHz tones as well as to broadband stimuli were also recorded. Results showed that patients with WS had a significantly higher suppression effect of the MOC reflex on TEOAE. Ipsilateral and contralateral acoustic reflexes to tonal and broadband stimuli presented at maximum stimulus intensities were absent in 62-86% of the patients with WS. In the remainder, acoustic reflexes were elicited at lower auditory sensation thresholds than in controls. Hyperexcitability of the MOC efferent system coupled with absence of acoustic reflexes may contribute to the hyperacusis in WS and the consequent high-tone hearing loss induced by environmental noise. Both measures can be used for objective detection and thus, intervention of hyperacusis in the early stages of life.
22402030	Noise exposure enhances auditory cortex responses related to hyperacusis behavior.	Hyperacusis, a marked intolerance to normal environmental sound, is a common symptom in patients with tinnitus, Williams syndrome, autism, and other neurologic diseases. It has been suggested that an imbalance of excitation and inhibition in the central auditory system (CAS) may play an important role in hyperacusis. Recent studies found that noise exposure, one of the most common causes of hearing loss and tinnitus, can increase the auditory cortex (AC) response, presumably by increasing the gain of the AC. However, it is not clear whether the increased cortical response will affect sound sensitivity and induce hyperacusis. In this experiment, we studied the effects of noise exposure (narrow band noise, 12 kHz, 120 dB SPL, 1 hour) on the physiological response of the inferior colliculus (IC) and the AC, and the behavioral sound reaction in conscious Sprague Dawley rats. Noise exposure induced a decrease of sound evoked potential in the IC. However, significant increases of AC response including sound evoked potentials and the spike firing rates of AC neurons were recorded right after the noise exposure. These results suggest that noise exposure induces hyperexcitability of AC presumably by increasing the post-synaptic response of AC neurons. The behavioral consequence of the noise exposure on sound perception was measured by the amplitude of the acoustic startle response before and after noise exposure in a separate group of rats. Although noise exposure caused a moderate hearing loss, the acoustic startle amplitude at the super-threshold level was significantly increased. These results suggest that noise exposure can cause exaggerated the sound reaction which may be related with the enhanced responsiveness of the AC neurons. This phenomenon may be related with noise induced hyperacusis.This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Tinnitus Neuroscience.
16831893	Thoracolumbar syrinx in association with Williams syndrome.	Williams syndrome is a genetic condition caused by a deletion on chromosome 7. Clinically it consists of multiple cardiovascular and craniofacial structural abnormalities as well as developmental delay, specific cognitive difficulties, and a characteristic personality. Although scoliosis is a noted manifestation of the disorder, syrinx in association with Williams syndrome has not been reported previously in the literature. Here we present the case of a child with Williams syndrome, scoliosis, and a thoracolumbar syrinx that was successfully treated surgically. We recommend that children with Williams syndrome and scoliosis undergo preoperative evaluation of the spinal cord, as well as the spinal column, so that correctable lesions such as a syrinx are not overlooked. Although syrinxes are often associated with scoliosis, the association in this case of syrinx and Williams syndrome could imply the existence of a genetic contribution to syrinx formation on chromosome 7.
27718424	Anxiety and autonomic response to social-affective stimuli in individuals with Williams syndrome.	BACKGROUND: Williams syndrome (WS) is a genetic condition characterized by an unusual "hypersocial" personality juxtaposed by high anxiety. Recent evidence suggests that autonomic reactivity to affective face stimuli is disorganised in WS, which may contribute to emotion dysregulation and/or social disinhibition. METHODS: Electrodermal activity (EDA) and mean interbeat interval (IBI) of 25 participants with WS (19 - 57 years old) and 16 typically developing (TD; 17-43 years old) adults were measured during a passive presentation of affective face and voice stimuli. The Beck Anxiety Inventory was administered to examine associations between autonomic reactivity to social-affective stimuli and anxiety symptomatology. RESULTS: The WS group was characterized by higher overall anxiety symptomatology, and poorer anger recognition in social visual and aural stimuli relative to the TD group. No between-group differences emerged in autonomic response patterns. Notably, for participants with WS, increased anxiety was uniquely associated with diminished arousal to angry faces and voices. In contrast, for the TD group, no associations emerged between anxiety and physiological responsivity to social-emotional stimuli. CONCLUSIONS: The anxiety associated with WS appears to be intimately related to reduced autonomic arousal to angry social stimuli, which may also be linked to the characteristic social disinhibition.
25603839	Hyperactive auditory processing in Williams syndrome: Evidence from auditory evoked potentials.	The neurophysiologic aberrations underlying the auditory hypersensitivity in Williams syndrome (WS) are not well defined. The P1-N1-P2 obligatory complex and mismatch negativity (MMN) response were investigated in 18 participants with WS, and the results were compared with those of 18 age- and gender-matched typically developing (TD) controls. Results revealed significantly higher amplitudes of both the P1-N1-P2 obligatory complex and the MMN response in the WS participants than in the TD controls. The P1-N1-P2 complex showed an age-dependent reduction in the TD but not in the WS participants. Moreover, high P1-N1-P2 complex was associated with low verbal comprehension scores in WS. This investigation demonstrates that central auditory processing is hyperactive in WS. The increase in auditory brain responses of both the obligatory complex and MMN response suggests aberrant processes of auditory encoding and discrimination in WS. Results also imply that auditory processing may be subjected to a delayed or diverse maturation and may affect the development of high cognitive functioning in WS. 
20441383	Discovering structure in auditory input: evidence from Williams syndrome.	We examined auditory perception in Williams syndrome by investigating strategies used in organizing sound patterns into coherent units. In Experiment 1, we investigated the streaming of sound sequences into perceptual units, on the basis of pitch cues, in a group of children and adults with Williams syndrome compared to typical controls. We showed that individuals with Williams syndrome were sensitive to the same pitch cues as typical children and adults when streaming these patterns. In Experiment 2, we evaluated differences in reliance on pitch and contour cues in unfamiliar melody perception in a group of adults with Williams syndrome relative to typical control children and adults. Unlike controls who demonstrated greater proficiency when contour cues were available, adults with Williams syndrome showed no such advantage.
20457168	Auditory cortical volumes and musical ability in Williams syndrome.	Individuals with Williams syndrome (WS) have been shown to have atypical morphology in the auditory cortex, an area associated with aspects of musicality. Some individuals with WS have demonstrated specific musical abilities, despite intellectual delays. Primary auditory cortex and planum temporale volumes were manually segmented in 25 individuals with WS and 25 control participants, and the participants also underwent testing of musical abilities. Left and right planum temporale volumes were significantly larger in the participants with WS than in controls, with no significant difference noted between groups in planum temporale asymmetry or primary auditory cortical volumes. Left planum temporale volume was significantly increased in a subgroup of the participants with WS who demonstrated specific musical strengths, as compared to the remaining WS participants, and was highly correlated with scores on a musical task. These findings suggest that differences in musical ability within WS may be in part associated with variability in the left auditory cortical region, providing further evidence of cognitive and neuroanatomical heterogeneity within this syndrome.
26456018	Risk assessment and anesthetic management of patients with Williams syndrome: a comprehensive review.	Since the first description in 1961, several case reports have documented an increased incidence of anesthesia-related cardiac arrest in patients with Williams-Beuren syndrome, commonly known as Williams syndrome (WS). Widespread arteriopathy secondary to an elastin gene defect results in various cardiac defects, including supravalvar aortic stenosis (SVAS) and coronary artery anomalies, which can increase the risk of myocardial ischemia. Even though patients with WS are known to have increased risk of adverse events during anesthesia and sedation, they often undergo several procedures that require anesthesia during their lifetimes, and cases of perianesthetic cardiac arrest continue to be reported. To date, no prospective studies have been reported that quantify anesthetic risk in individual patients with WS. In this article, we review the clinical manifestations of WS, propose a consensus, expert-informed method to estimate anesthetic risk based on the current literature, and provide recommendations for periprocedural management of this patient population. 
10545683	Concomitant reentrant tachycardias from concealed accessory atrioventricular bypass tract and atrioventricular nodal reentry in a patient with Williams syndrome.	Williams syndrome is characterized by a constellation of features including mental retardation and supravalvular aortic stenosis. Other cardiovascular abnormalities including arrhythmias contributing to sudden death have been described in these patients. In this report we describe a case of a 49-year-old female with Williams syndrome who presented with severe symptomatic supraventricular tachycardia. Cardiac electrophysiology study identified a left posteroseptal concealed accessory bypass tract responsible for atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia and a concomitant typical atrioventricular nodal tachycardia. Such unusual association of combination of two different types of supraventricular tachycardia and Williams syndrome has not been previously reported. Radiofrequency ablation was successfully performed to cure these arrhythmias.
19846117	Cardiovascular abnormalities, interventions, and long-term outcomes in infantile Williams syndrome.	OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of cardiovascular abnormalities (CVA) and outcomes in patients with Williams syndrome presenting before 1 year of age. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective review was undertaken of consecutive patients with WS at our institution from January 1, 1980, through December 31, 2007. WS was diagnosed by an experienced medical geneticist and/or by fluorescence in situ hybridization. CVA were diagnosed with the use of echocardiography, cardiac catheterization, or computerized tomographic angiography. Freedom from intervention was determined using Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS: The study group was 129 patients with CVA. Age at presentation was 127 +/- 116 days, with follow-up of 8.0 +/- 7.5 years (0 to 42 years). The most common lesions were peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis (62%) and supravalvar aortic stenosis (57%). Other CVA were common. CV interventions were performed in 29%, with 58% of those before 1 year. Freedom from intervention was 85%, 73%, and 66% at 1, 5, and 25 years, respectively. Four patients died. CONCLUSIONS: CVA are the most common manifestations of infantile Williams syndrome and occur with greater frequency than previously reported. In those with CVA, interventions are common and usually occur by 5 years of age. Most of these patients do not require intervention on long-term follow-up, and overall mortality is low.
12884637	The operative outcome in children with supravalvular aortic stenosis.	The authors present their experience in surgical treatment of children with supravalvular aortic stenosis (SAS). A retrospective analysis was carried out on 20 patients operated in the years 1980-1999. The group included 12 boys and 8 girls aged 0.9 to 14.5 years (mean 7.8 +/- 3.4 years). The diagnosis of Williams syndrome in 6 children (30%) was based on the typical face. The mean systolic pressure gradient across the SAS was 84.3 +/- 34.5 mmHg (range from 41 to 168 mmHg). Intraoperative studies allowed to determine that 16 (80%) children had the hourglass type, 2 (10%) tubular type and 2 (10%)--fibromuscular membrane type of stenosis. Sixteen (80%) children had anomalies of the aortic valve and/or coronary arteries, and in 13 (56%) children associated heart or great vessels anomalies were noted. All the patients were operated on using cardiopulmonary bypass and hypothermia. The associated anomalies were corrected simultaneously. There were no early and late deaths. Because of restenosis one child was reoperated. In the follow up the mean systolic pressure gradient between the left ventricle and ascending aorta revealed by echocardiography in 19 (95%) children to be 8 +/- 2 mmHg (range from 0 to 28 mmHg). Eighteen children are now in NYHA class I (New York Heart Association) and develop normally. Supravalvular aortic stenosis is a rare complex anomaly, which, because of life-threatening complications and low operative risk, should be fully repaired as soon as possible.
20440382	Auditory attraction: activation of visual cortex by music and sound in Williams syndrome.	Williams syndrome is a genetic neurodevelopmental disorder with a distinctive phenotype, including cognitive-linguistic features, nonsocial anxiety, and a strong attraction to music. we preformed functional MRI studies examining brain responses to musical and other types of stimuli in young adults with Williams syndrome and typically developing controls. In Study 1, the Williams syndrome group exhibited unforeseen activations of the visual cortex to musical stimuli, and it was this novel finding that became the focus of two subsequent studies. Using retinotopy, color localizers, and additional sound conditions, we identified specific visual areas in subjects with Williams syndrome that were activated by both musical and nonmusical auditory stimuli. The results, similar to synthetic-like experiences, have implications for cross-modal sensory processing in typical and atypical neurodevelopment.
24172828	Odontostomatological aspects in patients with Williams syndrome: a series of 4 cases.	The authors examined four patients with Williams syndrome presenting characteristic odontostomatological alterations. Agenesis, dental deposits, chewing difficulties due to bone malformations and poor cooperation of patients with malformations also in other districts and mental and physical retardation require the dentist to adopt different approaches, from restorative to orthodontic treatment, from periodontal to professional oral hygiene treatment. 
19066974	Renal dysplasia/hypoplasia, Williams Syndrome phenotype and non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the same patient: only a coincidence?	Congenital renal anomalies, Williams Syndrome and non-Hodgkin lymphoma all occur separately at low incidence, so their simultaneous presence in the same patient is exceptional. We present a young patient manifesting all three conditions. This child is a boy with a Williams Syndrome phenotype who was diagnosed with severe chronic kidney disease secondary to bilateral renal dysplasia/hypoplasia. Due to his small size, he received treatment with growth hormone. He progressed to end stage kidney disease and, after 8 months, a renal transplant was performed. A number of suspicious abdominal adenopathies were removed during the surgery and, thereafter, immunosupressive treatment with prednisone, azathioprine and cyclosporine was initiated. Examination of the biopsy tissue confirmed the presence of a T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma. Appropriate chemotherapy was given, and the immunosupressive regimen was eventually reduced to prednisone alone. Now, 8 years since the initial diagnosis of T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma and 6 years after the completion of the chemotherapy, the patient is still in complete remission with a functional donor kidney. We discuss some possible explanations of this association. Chemotherapy has not appeared to have affected the viability of the grafted kidney and, in fact, it may even have induced immunotolerance.
19391675	Referential communication skills of children with Williams syndrome: understanding when messages are not adequate.	Although children with Williams syndrome have relatively good structural language and concrete vocabulary abilities, they have difficulty with pragmatic aspects of language. To investigate the impact of pragmatic difficulties on listener-role referential communication, we administered a picture placement task designed to measure ability to verbalize message inadequacy to a speaker separated by a barrier. Participants were 57 children with Williams syndrome 6 to 12 years of age. When messages were inadequate, children verbalized that a problem was encountered less than half the time. The likelihood that children would indicate a message was insufficient and that children who verbalized message inadequacy also would effectively communicate the problem varied as a function of type of problem encountered, theory of mind knowledge, receptive vocabulary, and CA.
23386738	Neural correlates of cross-modal affective priming by music in Williams syndrome.	Emotional connection is the main reason people engage with music, and the emotional features of music can influence processing in other domains. Williams syndrome (WS) is a neurodevelopmental genetic disorder where musicality and sociability are prominent aspects of the phenotype. This study examined oscillatory brain activity during a musical affective priming paradigm. Participants with WS and age-matched typically developing controls heard brief emotional musical excerpts or emotionally neutral sounds and then reported the emotional valence (happy/sad) of subsequently presented faces. Participants with WS demonstrated greater evoked fronto-central alpha activity to the happy vs sad musical excerpts. The size of these alpha effects correlated with parent-reported emotional reactivity to music. Although participant groups did not differ in accuracy of identifying facial emotions, reaction time data revealed a music priming effect only in persons with WS, who responded faster when the face matched the emotional valence of the preceding musical excerpt vs when the valence differed. Matching emotional valence was also associated with greater evoked gamma activity thought to reflect cross-modal integration. This effect was not present in controls. The results suggest a specific connection between music and socioemotional processing and have implications for clinical and educational approaches for WS. 
10617019	Surgical treatment of aortic arch hypoplasia in infants and children with biventricular hearts.	BACKGROUND: Results of aortic arch reconstruction in the setting of biventricular physiology are well documented in the adult population, however, in children, surgical outcome of this subgroup of patients is less clear. METHODS: We studied the clinical outcomes of 37 children aged 8 days to 15 years (median 26 months), who underwent aortic arch reconstruction for arch hypoplasia from 1982 to 1997. The children were divided into three groups: Group 1 (20 patients) had isolated aortic arch lesions, Group 2 (13 patients) had associated intra-cardiac pathology yet conserving a biventricular physiology, Group 3 (4 patients) had Williams Syndrome. Previous interventions for coarctation had been performed in 30 patients (81%). Arch repair consisted of a patch aortoplasty in the majority of patients (35 of 37 children). RESULTS: Operative mortality occurred in 5 children, 4 in Group 2 (31%), 1 in Group 3 (25%) and none in Group 1. Permanent neurological complications occurred in 2 children (5 %). During the follow-up, which ranged from 1 month to 8 years, balloon angioplasty for arch obstruction was required in 1 child. There was one late death, associated with a subsequent intra-cardiac repair. CONCLUSIONS: Aortic arch surgery in children with isolated arch hypoplasia, is associated with excellent early and late survival in addition to a low reintervention rate. Alternative perfusion and operative strategies must be implemented in infants with associated intra-cardiac anomalies to improve results.
21507490	Behavioral phenotypes of genetic syndromes with intellectual disability: comparison of adaptive profiles.	The study of distinctive and consistent behaviors in the most common genetic syndromes with intellectual disability is useful to explain abnormalities or associated psychiatric disorders. The behavioral phenotypes revealed outcomes totally or partially specific for each syndrome. The aim of our study was to compare similarities and differences in the adaptive profiles of the five most frequent genetic syndromes, i.e. Down syndrome, Williams syndrome, Angelman syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, and Fragile-X syndrome (fully mutated), taking into account the relation with chronological age and the overall IQ level. The research was carried out using the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale (beside the Wechsler Intelligence scales to obtain IQ) with a sample of 181 persons (107 males and 74 females) showing genetic syndromes and mental retardation. Syndrome-based groups were matched for chronological age and mental age (excluding the Angelman group, presenting with severe mental retardation). Similarities and differences in the adaptive profiles are described, relating them to IQs and maladaptive behaviors. The results might be useful in obtaining a global index of adjustment for the assessment of intellectual disability level as well as for educational guidance and rehabilitative plans.
21656649	Left main coronary artery stenting after cardiac arrest in an infant with William's syndrome.	A 6-month-old female with William's syndrome and biventricular outflow obstruction had a cardiac arrest due to myocardial ischemia soon after induction of anesthesia during cardiac catheterization. The patient was supported with extra corporeal membrane oxygenator (ECMO) and successful stenting of the left main coronary artery was performed as a rescue measure. This intervention allowed successful weaning from ECMO and subsequent discharge from the hospital. Coronary intervention in infants may be successfully performed in dire situations.
39023193	A case of Williams syndrome with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.	INTRODUCTION: Williams syndrome (WS) cases have been reported to have with 25-100 times greater increased risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD). SCD has been reported in cases without any evidence of structural cardiovascular anomalies. Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is characterized by short PR interval and delta wave. Ventricular preexcitations can develop paroxysmal reentrant tachycardia through Kent bundle or less frequent atrial fibrillation and in some cases with accessory pathway effective refractory period (APERP) under 250 ms considered as risky and may lead to SCD. WS associated with WPW has not been reported before. CASE REPORT: An 11-year-old male who had been followed up with WS was referred to pediatric cardiology outpatient clinic with the complaint of palpitation. Electrocardiographic examination showed short PR interval and delta wave in the ECG consistent with WPW. He underwent electrophysiological study (EPS). Basic measurements were performed, and APERP was found at 280 ms cycle atrial pacing. RF energy was delivered using a 4 mm tip nonirrigated radiofrequency (RF) ablation catheter where the best ventriculoatrial (VA) signals were received and the AP was abolished within few seconds. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Although, WPW cases are usually asymptomatic or related to SVT, the risk of SCD should not be ignored. Thus, all patients with WPW deserve an EPS for assessing the AP conduction properties. Due to the increased risk of SCD in patients with WS compared to general population, in the presence of concomitant WPW, these patients should be evaluated with EPS even if they do not have symptoms.
26248474	Social functioning and autonomic nervous system sensitivity across vocal and musical emotion in Williams syndrome and autism spectrum disorder.	Both Williams syndrome (WS) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are associated with unusual auditory phenotypes with respect to processing vocal and musical stimuli, which may be shaped by the atypical social profiles that characterize the syndromes. Autonomic nervous system (ANS) reactivity to vocal and musical emotional stimuli was examined in 12 children with WS, 17 children with ASD, and 20 typically developing (TD) children, and related to their level of social functioning. The results of this small-scale study showed that after controlling for between-group differences in cognitive ability, all groups showed similar emotion identification performance across conditions. Additionally, in ASD, lower autonomic reactivity to human voice, and in TD, to musical emotion, was related to more normal social functioning. Compared to TD, both clinical groups showed increased arousal to vocalizations. A further result highlighted uniquely increased arousal to music in WS, contrasted with a decrease in arousal in ASD and TD. The ASD and WS groups exhibited arousal patterns suggestive of diminished habituation to the auditory stimuli. The results are discussed in the context of the clinical presentation of WS and ASD.
20715459	[Intraoperative aortic injury caused by arterial perfusion cannula during extended aortoplasty in a patient with Williams syndrome].	An 8-year-old girl with Williams syndrome underwent repair of supravalvular aortic stenosis by extended aortoplasty (Doty technique). Although she was weaned from bypass successfully, direct epiaortic ultrasound scanning disclosed the acute luminal narrowing of the ascending aorta at the level of aortic cannulation. The perfusion was restarted through the tube graft anastomosed to the left carotid artery and the ascending aorta was cross-clamped. The longitudinal incision at the site of prior aortic cannulation disclosed the intramural hematoma at the posterior wall of the ascending aorta. The stenosis was repaired with the patch enlargement of the anterior wall. As the dysplastic wall of the ascending aorta in patients with this syndrome may be injured by arterial cannula, an appropriate positioning of the cannula is mandatory to lessen the risk of intimal injury.
36840752	Transplantation in paediatric patients with MMA requires multidisciplinary approach for achievement of good clinical outcomes.	BACKGROUND: As modern medicine is advancing, younger, small, and more complex children are becoming multi-organ transplant candidates. This brings up new challenges in all aspects of their care. METHODS: We describe the first report of a small child receiving a simultaneous liver and kidney transplant and abdominal rectus sheath fascia transplant on the background of Williams syndrome and methylmalonic acidaemia. At the time of transplantation, the child was 3 years old, weighed 14.0 kg, had chronic kidney disease stage V, and had not yet started any other form of kidney replacement therapy. RESULTS: There were many anaesthetic, medical, metabolic, and surgical challenges to consider in this case. A long general anaesthetic time increased the risk of cardiac complications and metabolic decompensation. Additionally, the small size of the patient and the organ size mis-match meant that primary abdominal closure was not possible. The patient's recovery was further complicated by sepsis, transient CNI toxicity, and de novo DSAs. CONCLUSIONS: Through a multidisciplinary approach between 9 specialties in 4 hospitals across England and Wales, and detailed pre-operative planning, a good outcome was achieved for this child. An hour by hour management protocol was drafted to facilitate transplant and included five domains: 1. management at the time of organ offer; 2. before the admission; 3. at admission and before theatre time; 4. intra-operative management; and 5. post-operative management in the first 24 h. Importantly, gaining a clear and in depth understanding of the metabolic state of the patient pre- and peri-operatively was crucial in avoiding metabolic decompensation. Furthermore, an abdominal rectus sheath fascia transplant was required to achieve abdominal closure, which to our knowledge, had never been done before for this indication. Using our experience of this complex case, as well as our experience in transplanting other children with MMA, and through a literature review, we propose a new perioperative management pathway for this complex cohort of transplant recipients.
23954226	Sizeable acquired subglottic cyst in a baby with Williams-Beuren syndrome: association or coincidence?	We describe a case of an acquired subglottic cyst presented with persistent stridor and voice hoarsening in a baby diagnosed with Williams-Beuren syndrome that was born premature and required intubation during neonatal period. We also comment on whether this is a coincidence or there can be an association between impaired elastogenesis, a feature of patients with the syndrome and the formation of a subglottic cyst. 
33965724	Auditory hypersensitivity in Williams syndrome.	OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to investigate auditory hypersensitivity in WS and to evaluate hyperacusis through standardized protocols, checking if it can be associated with the absence of acoustic reflexes in people with WS. METHOD: The study was performed in 17 individuals with WS, aged between seven and 17 years old (10 males and seven females), and 17 individuals with typical development age- and gender-matched to individuals with WS. Statistical tests were used to analyze the responses collected with the Loudness Discomfort Level (LDL) test as well as ipsilateral and contralateral reflex responses. RESULTS: Auditory hypersensitivity was commonly found. Individuals with WS had phonophobia and were less tolerant to high sound intensity, presenting a reduced discomfort threshold compared to those with typical development. However, hyperacusis was found in 35.29% of individuals with WS and was mild in 50% of cases. There was an association between hyperacusis and acoustic reflex responses, and individuals with absence of the contralateral acoustic reflex were more likely to have hyperacusis. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with WS have a high prevalence of auditory hypersensitivity, with the presence of phonophobia; however, hyperacusis was not as prevalent and may be associated with the absence of contralateral acoustic reflexes.
20005238	Atypical hemispheric asymmetry in the perception of negative human vocalizations in individuals with Williams syndrome.	Williams syndrome is a neurological condition associated with high levels of auditory reactivity and emotional expression combined with impaired perception of prosody. Yet, little is currently known about the neural organization of affective auditory processing in individuals with this disorder. The current study examines auditory emotion processing in individuals with Williams syndrome. Hemispheric organization for positive and negative human non-linguistic sound processing was compared in participants with and without the disorder using a dichotic listening paradigm. While controls exhibited an expected right cerebral hemisphere advantage for processing negative sounds, those with Williams syndrome showed the opposite pattern. No differences between the groups emerged for the positive stimuli. The results suggest aberrant processing of negative auditory information in Williams syndrome.
12822165	Endovascular stent implantation in patients with stenotic aortoarteriopathies: early and medium-term results.	Data regarding stent implantation for stenotic aortoarteriopathy (SAA) are incomplete. We report on nine patients with this rare syndrome who underwent arterial stent implantation. Indications, results, and complications for patients with SAA were reviewed. Nine patients underwent 11 procedures. Twenty-two stents were implanted in the aorta or brachiocephalic vessels. Five patients had diffuse stenoses, three patients had middle aortic syndrome, and one patient had thoracic and abdominal coarctation. Associated diagnoses included Williams syndrome (2), neurofibromatosis (2), Takayasu's (1), and congenital rubella (1). Median gradient was 60 mm Hg (20-140 mm Hg). Poststent gradient was 15 mm Hg (0-60 mm Hg; P < 0.001). Additional stents were implanted in two patients and five underwent stent redilation. Two patients (22%) were found to have aneurysm formation. Stent implantation effectively provides gradient relief in SAA. Gradient reduction persists or is amenable to redilation. Importantly, however, uncomplicated stent implantation does not preclude aneurysm formation and may be more common than in traditional patient groups.
23941859	Outcomes after primary transcatheter therapy in infants and young children with severe bilateral peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis.	BACKGROUND: Angioplasty and stent implantation have become accepted therapies for isolated peripheral pulmonary stenosis, and have been shown to increase vessel diameter and reduce right ventricular (RV) pressure acutely in patients with pulmonary artery (PA) stenosis. The purpose of this study was to assess long-term outcomes after primary transcatheter therapy for peripheral pulmonary stenosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 69 patients who underwent primary transcatheter intervention for severe isolated peripheral pulmonary stenosis at <= 5 years of age. Genetic/syndromic diagnoses included Williams syndrome (n=23), non-Williams familial arteriopathy (n=12), and Alagille syndrome (n=3). At the initial PA intervention, median RV:aortic pressure ratio decreased from 1.00 to 0.88 (median decrease, 0.18; P<0.001). Patients with a higher preintervention RV:aortic pressure ratio had a greater reduction (P<0.001). During follow-up (median, 8.5 years), 10 patients died, 5 from complications of PA catheterization (all before 1998). Thirteen patients underwent surgical PA intervention, most within 1 year and along with repair of supravalvar aortic stenosis. Freedom from any PA reintervention was 38 +- 6% at 1 year and 22 +- 6% at 5 years. The median RV:aortic pressure ratio decreased from 1.0 at baseline to 0.53 at the most recent catheterization (P<0.001), and 82% of patients with available clinical follow-up were asymptomatic. CONCLUSIONS: Transcatheter therapy for infants with severe peripheral pulmonary stenosis has become safer, regardless of genetic condition. Coupled with reintervention and surgical relief in selected cases, RV:aortic pressure ratios decrease substantially and most patients are asymptomatic at late follow-up.
29981951	Parental views on special educational needs provision: Cross-syndrome comparisons in Williams Syndrome, Down Syndrome, and Autism Spectrum Disorders.	BACKGROUND: The current study examined parents' views about their child's educational provision for children with Williams syndrome (WS), Down syndrome (DS), and Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). AIMS: This cross-syndrome comparison explored the specific and general difficulties that parents of children with neurodevelopmental disorders experience about their child's educational provision. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Parents of children aged 4-18;11 years old, including 99 with WS, 88 with DS, and 82 with ASD completed a survey. OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: Children with DS were more likely to access mainstream settings and 1-to-1 support compared to those with WS and ASD. Parental satisfaction was lowest for those with ASD but all parents mentioned concerns about professionals' knowledge of how to support children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND). There were also group differences for access to specialist support but overall access to occupational therapy and mental health was low. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: In contrast to previous studies, educational provision and satisfaction with educational provision are syndrome-specific. These results also highlight the need for training and raising awareness about the specific needs of children with neurodevelopmental disorders. In addition, our findings suggest improved communication between parents and the school is required about the type of support children with SEND are receiving.
24139709	Accelerometer-determined physical activity and walking capacity in persons with Down syndrome, Williams syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome.	In this study we describe by use of accelerometers the total physical activity (PA), intensity pattern and walking capacity in 87 persons age 16-45 years with Down syndrome (DS), Williams syndrome (WS) and Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). Participants were recruited from all over Norway, and lived either with their parents or in community residences with support. On average the participants generated 294 counts per minute (cpm) or 6712 steps per day, with most of the day spent in sedentary activity, 522 min/day, followed by 212 min/day in light PA, 71 min/day in lifestyle activity and 27 min/day in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Inactivity was prevalent, as only 12% meet the current Nordic recommendations for PA. When compared, no differences for total physical activity or time in MVPA were observed between the three groups. However, participant with DS spent a mean of 73 min/day less and 43 min/day less in sedentary activities compared to participants with PWS and WS, respectively, (p=0.011, 95% CI: -10.9; -80.1). In addition the DS-group spent a mean of 66 min/day more in light PA than the PWS-group and 41 min/day more than the WS-group, (p<0.001, 95% CI: 29.3; 79.7). Participants with PWS spent on average 30 min/day less in lifestyle activities compared to both participants with DS and WS, (p<0.001, 95% CI: -14.2; -45.4). No association between total PA and BMI were observed. Males were more active than females across all diagnoses. Males accumulated on average 85 counts per minutes more than females, (p=0.002, 95% CI: 33.3; 136.7), 2137 more steps per day, (p=0.002, 95% CI: 778; 3496). The mean walking capacity during six-minutes was 507 m (SD 112 m) for males and 466 m (SD 88 m) for females. Distance walked during testing decreased with 33.6 m when comparing normal or underweight participants to overweight participants, and 78.1 m when comparing overweight to obese participants (p<0.001 95% CI: -40.4; -85.8). When adjusted for BMI no differences in walking capacity between the three genetic conditions were observed.
20411252	Stenosis of the thoracic aorta in Williams syndrome.	Williams syndrome (WS) is a multisystem congenital disorder affecting 1/8000 live births. Our objective was to review our experience with stenosis of the thoracic aorta (STA) in these patients. A retrospective review was undertaken of consecutive WS patients at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia from January 1, 1980, through December 31, 2007. WS was diagnosed by an experienced medical geneticist and/or by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Stenosis was diagnosed with either echocardiography or cardiac catheterization. Freedom from intervention was determined using Kaplan-Meier analysis. From a total cohort of 270 patients, 37 (14%) patients with STA were identified and comprised the study group. Age at presentation was 2.1 + or - 4.0 years, and follow-up was 11.8 + or - 12.6 years (range 0-51). Long-segment STA was more common (89%) than discrete STA. Severity of STA was mild in 18, moderate in 10, and severe in 9 patients. Branch pulmonary artery stenosis was seen in 62% (23 of 37) of STA patients, and supravalvar aortic stenosis was seen in 54% (20 of 37) STA patients. Nine (24%) patients underwent intervention for STA: 8 cases were severe, and 1 case was moderate. Restenosis resulting in reintervention occurred in 5 of 9 (56%) patients, with 4 of 5 (80%) patients undergoing multiple reinterventions. Freedom from intervention was 89, 82, and 73% at 1, 5, and 20 years, respectively. One patient died. STA is common in WS and is generally the long-segment type. In patients with STA, interventions are common and usually occur by 5 years of age. Reintervention for STA occurs frequently.
31964759	Health Care Supervision for Children With Williams Syndrome.	This set of recommendations is designed to assist the pediatrician in caring for children with Williams syndrome (WS) who were diagnosed by using clinical features and with chromosome 7 microdeletion confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization, chromosome microarray, or multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. The recommendations in this report reflect review of the current literature, including previously peer-reviewed and published management suggestions for WS, as well as the consensus of physicians and psychologists with expertise in the care of individuals with WS. These general recommendations for the syndrome do not replace individualized medical assessment and treatment.
24450321	Adaptive behavior and problem behavior in young children with Williams syndrome.	The present study compares the adaptive behavior profile of 18 young children with Williams syndrome (WS) and a developmentally matched group of 19 children with developmental disabilities and examines the relationship between adaptive behavior and problem behaviors in WS. Parents completed the Vineland Adaptive Behavioral Scales-Interview edition and the Developmental Behavior Checklist-Primary Caregiver version (WS only). Children with WS had higher adaptive communication scores than children with other developmental disabilities. Children with WS demonstrated relative strengths in adaptive communication and socialization, coupled with relative weaknesses in daily living. Adaptive communication and socialization were negatively associated with problem behaviors in social relating in WS.
15691415	Restenosis after aortic stenting.	Aortic coarctation is a recognized arteriopathy in patients with Williams' syndrome. We present an adolescent with Williams' syndrome who developed rapid restenosis after primary stenting of coarctation of the aorta. We believe such restenosis within the stent is due to a proliferative response of the abnormal aortic wall. Attention should be paid to the potential for restenosis during follow-up after stenting of aortic coarctation in patients with Williams' syndrome.
29353707	Attentional rather than sensory differences characterize auditory processing in Williams syndrome.	Individuals with Williams Syndrome (WS) exhibit an atypical auditory profile. Across two experiments, we used event-related potentials (ERPs) in a three-stimulus auditory oddball task to examine early sensory (P1, N1, P2) and later cognitive (P3a, P3b) stages of cortical auditory processing in adults with WS and age-matched typical peers. In Study 1, piano chords served as standard, target, and novel stimuli; whereas, in Study 2, a variety of non-piano sounds comprised the novel stimuli. Across both experiments, there were no group differences in the earliest stages of sensory encoding (P1, N1), along with evidence for atypically large P2 responses in participants with WS. Persons with WS exhibited larger than typical P3a responses when the novel stimuli were perceptually distinct from the standard and the target stimuli (Study 2), but not when task-relevant and -irrelevant stimuli were perceptually similar (Study 1). Further, the WS group demonstrated reduced goal-directed attention (attenuated P3b response). These group differences in ERPs were not directly related to IQ. Our results in the context of an active discrimination task point to a more complex profile of auditory processing in persons with WS than previously reported, with group differences emerging during the later stages of stimulus categorization and evaluation, but not within early stimulus detection and feature encoding.
21528818	Severe hypercalcemia associated with Williams syndrome successfully treated with pamidronate infusion therapy.	Infantile hypercalcemia becomes manifest in 15% of patients with Williams syndrome (WS) and generally is not clinically severe. However, some patients with WS can have severe hypercalcemia and do not respond well to traditional therapies. Recently, pamidronate has been used in the treatment of childhood hypercalcemia associated with many disorders, but there is little experience with the treatment of hypercalcemia with bisphosphonates in patients with WS. We present a 17-month-old female patient, who had been diagnosed as WS by genetic analysis, admitted to our clinic for the investigation of severe hypercalcemia (4.02 mmol/L). Because the patient did not respond very well to fluid administration, furosemide infusion, and dietary calcium restriction, pamidronate infusion was performed and calcium levels returned to normal within 2 days. This case report is presented to point out that pamidronate therapy seems to be a safe and efficient way of treating life-threatening hypercalcemia in WS.
13677282	[Two occasions of anesthetic management for a patient with Williams syndrome].	A 5-year-old boy with Williams syndrome received open reduction of fracture of the antebrachium twice. He had been diagnosed as having Williams syndrome with some characteristic symptoms, including elfin face, mental retardation and primary pulmonary hypertension. Williams syndrome has a tetrad of cardiovascular disease, elfin face, mental retardation and hypercalcemia. Operations were performed twice under general anesthesia. Airway management with mask technique was easily performed. Tracheal intubation was accomplished successfully. Anesthesia was induced with propofol, fentanyl, and vecuronium, and maintained with propofol, fentanyl and the inhalation of oxygen with nitrous oxide. Both anesthetic courses were uneventful and he was discharged without any complications. Special anesthetic considerations should be taken for difficulties of intubation, management of circulatory system, malignant hyperthermia, and hypercalcemia in this syndrome.
19334304	Exploring face perception in disorders of development: evidence from Williams syndrome and autism.	Individuals with Williams syndrome (WS) and autism are characterized by different social phenotypes but have been said to show similar atypicalities of face-processing style. Although the structural encoding of faces may be similarly atypical in these two developmental disorders, there are clear differences in overall face skills. The inclusion of both populations in the same study can address how the profile of face skills varies across disorders. The current paper explored the processing of identity, eye-gaze, lipreading, and expressions of emotion using the same participants across face domains. The tasks had previously been used to make claims of a modular structure to face perception in typical development. Participants with WS (N=15) and autism (N=20) could be dissociated from each other, and from individuals with general developmental delay, in the domains of eye-gaze and expression processing. Individuals with WS were stronger at these skills than individuals with autism. Even if the structural encoding of faces appears similarly atypical in these groups, the overall profile of face skills, as well as the underlying architecture of face perception, varies greatly. The research provides insights into typical and atypical models of face perception in WS and autism.
14767846	Interventional radiology for renovascular hypertension in children.	Pediatric renovascular hypertension is an uncommon but important clinical problem. Atherosclerosis is rare in children, who typically suffer from fibromuscular dysplasia, neurofibromatosis type 1, Williams syndrome, or certain other rare conditions. Children with renovascular disease often have involvement of other arteries including the aorta and mesenteric and cerebral vessels. The pediatric interventional radiology service has a vital role in the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of renovascular hypertension. Renal vein renin sampling appears to be more useful in children than in adults, because their arterial disease is more often bilateral and segmental. Diagnostic angiography is still superior to less-invasive methods of imaging the renal arteries, especially the smaller branches. Interventional options include angioplasty, stenting, and ethanol ablation. Angioplasty is almost always technically successful and usually gives a worthwhile clinical improvement. Stenting is only used in children when angioplasty fails. Ethanol embolization may be appropriate in children with focal renin-producing areas that are untreatable by angioplasty.
17326117	Language phenotypes and intervention planning: bridging research and practice.	This paper focuses on the communication and language phenotypes associated with three genetic disorders: Down syndrome, Williams syndrome, and fragile X syndrome. It is argued that there is empirical evidence that these disorders predispose children to specific profiles of strength and weakness in some areas of speech, language, and communication, and that intervention planning for children with each syndrome may take an approach informed by these profiles. Issues related to within-group variability, shared outcomes among syndromes, and the need for empirical validation for syndrome-specific recommendations are discussed.
17401760	Pulmonary arterial stent implantation in an adult with Williams syndrome.	We report a 38-year-old patient who presented with pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular dysfunction due to pulmonary artery stenoses as a manifestation of Williams syndrome, mimicking chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. The patient was treated with balloon angioplasty and stent implantation. Short-term follow-up showed a good clinical result with excellent patency of the stents but early restenosis of the segments in which only balloon angioplasty was performed. These stenoses were subsequently also treated successfully by stent implantation. Stent patency was observed 3 years after the first procedure.
27113718	Contrast-marking prosodic emphasis in Williams syndrome: results of detailed phonetic analysis.	BACKGROUND: Past reports on the speech production of individuals with Williams syndrome (WS) suggest that their prosody is anomalous and may lead to challenges in spoken communication. While existing prosodic assessments confirm that individuals with WS fail to use prosodic emphasis to express contrast, those reports typically lack detailed phonetic analysis of speech data. The present study examines the acoustic properties of speech prosody, aiming for the future development of targeted speech interventions. AIMS: The study examines the three primary acoustic correlates of prosodic emphasis (duration, intensity, F0) and determines whether individuals with WS have difficulty in producing all or a particular set of the three prosodic cues. METHODS & PROCEDURES: Speech produced by 12 individuals with WS and 12 chronological age (CA)-matched typically developing individuals were recorded. A sequential picture-naming task elicited production of target phrases in three contexts: (1) no contrast: gorilla with a racket   rabbit with a balloon; (2) contrast on the animal: fox with a balloon   rabbit with a balloon; and (3) contrast on the object: rabbit with a ball   rabbit with a balloon. The three acoustic correlates of prosodic prominence (duration, intensity and F0) were compared across the three referential contexts. OUTCOMES & RESULTS: The two groups exhibited striking similarities in their use of word duration and intensity for expressing contrast. Both groups showed the reduction and enhancement of final lengthening, and the enhancement and reduction of intensity difference for the animal contrast and for the object contrast conditions, respectively. The two groups differed in their use of F0: the CA group produced higher F0 for the animal than for the object regardless of the context, and this difference was enhanced when the animal noun was contrastive. In contrast, the WS group produced higher F0 for the object than for the animal when the object was contrastive. CONCLUSIONS & IMPLICATIONS: The present data contradict previous assessment results that report a lack of prosodic skills to mark contrast in individuals with WS. The methodological differences that may account for this variability are discussed. The present data suggest that individuals with WS produce appropriate prosodic cues to express contrast, although their use of pitch may be somewhat atypical. Additional data and future speech comprehension studies will determine whether pitch modulation can be targeted for speech intervention in individuals with WS.
14636357	Infantile spasms in a patient with williams syndrome and craniosynostosis.	A patient with Williams syndrome, craniosynostosis, and infantile spasms is described. At age 6 months, the infant demonstrated infantile spasms and craniosynostosis and was operated on for craniosynostosis and treated with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) for the infantile spasms. ACTH completely controlled the seizures, but was halted because of the progression of ventricular hypertrophy. The seizure returned, and he was found to have elfin face, failure-to-thrive, developmental delay, and dental malformation in addition to congenital heart defects. High-resolution chromosome analysis revealed interstitial deletion of 7q11.22-q11.23. Therefore his clinical and cytogenetic diagnosis was Williams syndrome. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) therapy reduced his seizures and improved the findings of EEG without cardiac side effects. In addition, his psychomotor development was slightly improved.
15466114	Severe infantile hypercalcemia associated with Williams syndrome successfully treated with intravenously administered pamidronate.	Infantile hypercalcemia occurs in approximately 15% of children with Williams syndrome (WS) and is typically not clinically severe. We report on 3 children with WS (confirmed with fluorescent in situ hybridization probes) who presented with severe symptomatic hypercalcemia. The first patient's severe hypercalcemia resolved with traditional therapies, whereas the subsequent 2 patients were treated with intravenously administered pamidronate after traditional measures proved only partially successful. Besides asymptomatic mild hypocalcemia, there were no complications resulting from pamidronate administration. We conclude that WS-associated hypercalcemia can be quite severe and symptomatic and that it can be successfully and safely treated with intravenously administered bisphosphonate in some cases.
10424998	Brom's three-patch technique for repair of supravalvular aortic stenosis.	OBJECTIVE: Case histories of all patients (n = 29) operated on for supravalvular aortic stenosis from 1962 to the present were reviewed to study different techniques and outcomes. The technique of symmetric aortoplasty with 3 patches (1 in each sinus) is described and compared with other methods. METHODS: Case reports were reviewed and follow-up was completed by contacting the patient's (pediatric) cardiologist. We aimed for a last follow-up visit, including Doppler echocardiographic studies, in a period no more than 12 months earlier than December 1997. Supravalvular aortic stenosis was discrete in 25 and diffuse with involvement of the aortic arch and arch vessels in 4 patients. Additional anomalies were bicuspid aortic valve (n = 5), coarctation (n = 3), ascending aortic aneurysm (n = 1), mitral valve insufficiency (n = 2), pulmonary valvular stenosis (n = 1), and peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis (n = 2). Eleven patients had Williams syndrome and 1 patient had Noonan syndrome. Symmetric aortoplasty with 3 patches (1 in each sinus) was used in 13 patients, whereas other nonsymmetric methods (1, 2, or Y-shaped patches) were used in 16 patients. Mean follow-up was 10.5 years (range: 4 months-36 years). RESULTS: All techniques adequately decreased the pressure gradient. Progression of preoperative aortic valve insufficiency or de novo regurgitation was not observed except in 1 patient in whom the patches inserted were too large. CONCLUSIONS: No difference could be demonstrated in outcome for any surgical technique; however, reconstruction of the aortic root with autologous pericardial patches in each sinus after transection of the aorta has the advantage of symmetry while restoring the normal aortic root anatomy.
27546029	Developmental trajectories of structural and pragmatic language skills in school-aged children with Williams syndrome.	BACKGROUND: This study aimed to compare developmental courses of structural and pragmatic language skills in school-aged children with Williams syndrome (WS) and children with idiopathic intellectual disability (IID). Comparison of these language trajectories could highlight syndrome-specific developmental features. METHOD: Twelve monolingual Dutch-speaking children with WS aged 5.10 to 13.3 years were assessed by means of standardised structural language tests measuring receptive and expressive vocabulary and sentence comprehension and production. Pragmatic language was evaluated by means of an expressive referential communication task and a retelling test. All of these language abilities were re-evaluated with the same measures after a period of 18 to 24 months. Performance was compared to 12 children with IID pairwise matched for chronological age (CA) and non-verbal fluid reasoning (Gf) at Time 1. Non-verbal mental age (NVMA) was taken into account when delineating developmental trajectories. RESULTS: Children with WS outperformed children with IID on expressive vocabulary development. In contrast, sentence comprehension was significantly poorer than in children with IID at the second time point. Increased variability and rather poor performance on pragmatic language tasks were demonstrated in the WS group. Irrelevant and off-topic extraneous information transfer continued to be a syndrome-specific characteristic of children with WS. CONCLUSION: The data provide new insights into diverging developmental trajectories across language domains. Expressive structural language skills tend to progress more rapidly than receptive language skills in children with WS causing more distinctive language profiles over time. Some children with WS seem to benefit from the growth in expressive structural language abilities to enhance their expressive pragmatic language skills, while in some others these abilities remain challenging. This study highlights the need for continued follow-up of language challenges in WS and for a dynamic and individualised interventional approach.
20417748	Midterm outcomes in supravalvular aortic stenosis demonstrate the superiority of multisinus aortoplasty.	BACKGROUND: Surgical techniques for repair of supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) include McGoon's one-patch, Doty's two-patch, and Brom's three-patch method. In this review we evaluated mid-term clinical outcomes of these techniques at our institution. METHODS: Our cardiac surgery database identified patients with SVAS repair from 1990 to 2008. Follow-up records, reintervention and reoperation data, and most recent echocardiograms were obtained. RESULTS: From 1990 to 2008, 20 patients (70% male) underwent surgery for SVAS. Mean age was 3.6 +/- 5.6 years. In chronological sequence, 8 patients had single-patch aortoplasty, 4 had the Doty procedure, and 8 received Brom's symmetric three-patch aortoplasty. Of the Brom patients, 6 had Williams syndrome. Aortic cross-clamp times were 40.1 +/- 13.6 minutes (one-patch), 60.3 +/- 38.8 minutes (Doty), and 104 +/- 20.5 minutes (Brom). Perioperative mortality was 5.0% (1 patient in one-patch group). Mean postoperative length of stay was 10 +/- 10.6 days. Follow-up data were available for all survivors (mean follow-up, 6.3 +/- 6.0 years; range, 6 months to 16 years). There were no late deaths. Follow-up echocardiograms revealed a peak Doppler gradient across the aortic outflow tract of 33 +/- 18.0 mm Hg (one-patch), 10 +/- 1 mm Hg (Doty), and 18 +/- 12 mm Hg (Brom). All patients in the Doty and Brom groups had less than moderate aortic insufficiency. Reoperations were required in 5 of 8 one-patch patients (62%) for residual aortic stenosis (n = 3), aortic insufficiency (n = 1), and subvalvar stenosis (n = 1). No Doty or Brom patient has required aortic reoperations, which was nearly statistically associated with freedom from reoperation (p = 0.06). Subvalvar stenosis was the only risk factor associated with reoperation (p = 0.0028). CONCLUSIONS: Despite a longer cross-clamp time, SVAS repair by Doty or Brom aortoplasty restores normal hemodynamics and reduces the need for reoperation when compared with the classic one-patch technique. Our current preference for SVAS repair is the Brom three-patch symmetric aortoplasty.
19052807	Cardiac catheterization and operative outcomes from a multicenter consortium for children with williams syndrome.	Williams syndrome is a multifaceted disorder that includes a spectrum of cardiovascular anomalies. Due to its rare occurrence, outcome data for operations and cardiac catheterization are limited. We reviewed data from 242 individuals from the Pediatric Cardiac Care Consortium (PCCC) with Williams syndrome and associated cardiovascular lesions, and their frequency, and assessed their effects on mortality. In the PCCC, from 1984 to 1999 there were approximately 100,000 entries for cardiac procedures, involving more than 62,000 patients. The diagnosis of Williams syndrome was based on clinical features and determined by each site. Most patients were diagnosed with the availability of the FISH probe for region 7q11.23. Using a spreadsheet application, Microsoft Excel, the selected patients were analyzed for various types of cardiac anomalies. The most common cardiovascular lesions and the mortality rate in patients with Williams syndrome were examined. A complete tabulation of all cardiovascular lesions was assembled. There were 292 catheterizations and 143 operations reported to the PCCC. One hundred six patients had both an operation and a catheterization. The three main cardiovascular anomalies were supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS; 169), pulmonary artery stenosis (PAS; 130), and coarctation or aortic arch hypoplasia (Arch; 32). One hundred five patients had a single lesion, 70 with SVAS, 29 with PAS, and 6 with an arch anomaly. Ninety-two had more than one lesion: 80 with SVAS and PAS, 7 with PAS and Arch, and 5 with SVAS and Arch. Seventy individuals have only SVAS, 29 PAS, and 6 Arch alone. There was a total of 15 deaths. The mortality rate was highest in the group with the combination of SVAS and PAS (7 surgical and 5 catheter; 12 of 80 patients [15%]; p = 0.0001, chi(2)). In conclusion, our data represent the largest collection of individuals with Williams syndrome who underwent cardiac catheterization and/or operation. The data suggest that children with Williams syndrome and bilateral outflow tract obstruction have statistically and clinically significantly higher mortality associated with catheterization or operation.
22111359	[Airway management in a patient with Williams syndrome].	Williams syndrome is characterized by the triad of supravalvular aortic stenosis (SAS), mental retardation and elfin facies. Generally, difficult airway is expected in patients with Williams syndrome by characteristic face. A 26-year-old female with Williams syndrome was scheduled for abdominal myomectomy under general anesthesia. Difficult mask ventilation and tracheal intubation were anticipated because of micrognathia, mandibular retrusion, and a Mallanpati class III airway. Before induction of anesthesia the patient breathed 100% oxygen for 3 minutes. Anesthesia was induced and maintained with propofol, remifentanil and rocuronium bromide. Mask ventilation was easily performed. The direct laryngoscopic view was Cormack grade I and there was no difficulty in the tracheal intubation. After induction of anesthesia, anesthetic course was uneventful. According to the most previous clinical reports in patients with Williams syndrome in Japan, mask ventilation and tracheal intubation were performed easily contrary to preoperative airway assessment. In view of SAS, mental retardation, airway deformity and airway assessment in previous clinical reports, we should select the optimal strategy for airway management in patients with Williams syndrome.
21801261	'Too withdrawn' or 'too friendly': considering social vulnerability in two neuro-developmental disorders.	In some neuro-developmental disorders, the combined effect of intellectual disability and atypicalities of social cognition may put individuals at increased vulnerability in their social environment. The neuro-developmental disorders Williams syndrome, characterised by 'hypersociability', and autism spectrum disorders, characterised by 'social withdrawal', are at two extremes of atypical social functioning in humans. In this article, we use Williams syndrome and autism spectrum disorders as exemplars to demonstrate how atypicalities of social cognition may contribute to social vulnerability in these populations. The lives of individuals with both these disorders are marred by an increased risk of social isolation, bullying, unsteady relationships, employment difficulties and abuse. While different behavioural interventions have been tried to improve social functioning in these populations, there has been great variability in their success. Finally, we discuss different issues regarding social independence of these individuals; including employment, safety and decision making.
16080773	Music and anxiety in Williams syndrome: a harmonious or discordant relationship?	In this two-part study, we assessed musical involvements in two samples of persons with Williams syndrome compared to others with mental retardation and also related musicality to anxiety and fears in Study 2. Relative to others with mental retardation, those with Williams syndrome were more likely to take music lessons, play an instrument, and have higher ratings of musical skills. In the Williams syndrome groups only, fewer externalizing symptoms were associated with listening to music, whereas less anxiety and fewer fears were associated with the frequency, duration, and skill in producing music as well as emotional responses to negatively toned music. Implications are discussed for future research on musical processing, musical interventions, and well-being in Williams syndrome and other groups.
15725324	Perioperative care of the patient with Williams syndrome.	Williams syndrome, initially described by Williams, Barratt-Boyes, and Lowe in 1961, consists of characteristic dysmorphic features, congenital heart disease, and distinctive behavioral and emotional traits. In addition to acquired and congenital heart disease, manifestations in the renal, endocrine, musculoskeletal, and central nervous system may have implications during the perioperative period. Congenital and acquired heart disease can be a significant issue as sudden death, related to abnormalities of the coronary arteries, has been reported perioperatively in these patients. The authors present a 7-month-old infant, previously diagnosed with Williams syndrome, who required anesthetic care for repair of subaortic and supravalvular aortic stenosis. The potential perioperative implications of Williams syndrome are discussed.
20559990	Pediatric Cardiac Care Consortium: an instrument for evidence-based clinical decision support.	Pediatric Cardiac Care Consortium is a registry of cardiac catheterizations, surgical operations, and autopsies performed for infants, children, and adults with congenital heart disease. Four examples of use of PCCC data to evaluate variability in morphology, management, and outcomes for the procedures are described. Consideration is given to the following clinical problems: (1) the experience with surgical heart block in operative closure of perimembranous VSD, (2) the transition away from atrial baffle operations to the arterial switch operation for simple transposition of the great arteries, (3) the experience of planned 3 stage palliation of hypoplastic left heart syndrome, and (4) the identification of a high risk combination of cardiovascular anomalies in Williams syndrome. Analysis of registry outcomes allows ongoing quality improvement at a cardiac center to consider not only its own experience but that of the overall group. The PCCC data can be used to personalize management of rare congenital cardiac anomalies and combinations of anomalies. The PCCC registry allows longitudinal consideration of issues such as staged repairs and incidence of unplanned reoperation. In future years, the PCCC can facilitate investigations into the etiology of congenital heart disease.
34550568	The Importance of Experimental Investigation of the CNS Oxytocin System.	This chapter provides an overview of the oxytocinergic system and its role in social behavior. We first consider the relationship between oxytocin and social behavior in neurotypical individuals, focusing on studies that have looked at effects of intranasal oxytocin treatment, as well as research investigating the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms associated with individual differences in social behavior. We then outline the proposed role of the oxytocinergic system in autism spectrum disorder and Williams syndrome, two neurodevelopmental disorders where a dysfunctional oxytocinergic system is thought to lead to difficulties in social behavior. Given the contrasting social phenotypes of these disorders, they provide an intriguing comparison through which we can better understand the role of the oxytocinergic system in social behavior. Finally, we consider how future research can best harness the potential of oxytocin, both by addressing measurement and administration issues inherent in many studies, and by developing our understanding of the oxytocinergic system so we are better able to identify the people who are likely to benefit from oxytocin treatment, and intervene at the right time.
22835635	[Diagnostic delay of rare diseases in Europe and in Hungary].	UNLABELLED: The long diagnostic delay is a characteristic problem of rare disease patients. AIMS: Diagnostic delay was studied in 14 countries by EurordisCare2 involving patient organizations. METHODS: 252 Hungarian patients (cystic fibrosis; Duchenne muscular dystrophy; tuberous sclerosis, retinitis pigmentosa, and Williams' syndrome) completed the questionnaires. RESULTS: The median delay was longer in Hungary than in Europe (cystic fibrosis: 227 vs. 45 days; Duchenne muscular dystrophy: 467 vs. 360 days; tuberous sclerosis: 155 vs. 120 days). Patients' experience was similar in Hungary and in Europe. The proportion of misdiagnosis was 30.8% in Hungary (Europe: 41%), 34.8% of patients got diagnosis outside of living place region (EU: 26%) and 19.9% of them found the personal expenses too high (EU: 10%). Delivery of the diagnosis was unnecessary according to 27.4% of Hungarian patients (EU: 35%). CONCLUSIONS: The qualitative survey demonstrated that the problems with the diagnosis of rare diseases are widespread, the identified areas require interventions, and it confirmed the importance of centralized care.
28287063	Fatal severe coronary artery stenosis in Williams syndrome: decision making using late gadolinium enhancement cardiovascular MRI.	Williams syndrome is a well-recognised congenital disorder characterised by cardiovascular, connective tissue, and central nervous system abnormalities. Coronary artery abnormalities are seen in patients with supravalvar aortic stenosis, but end-stage ischaemic heart disease is rare. We report a case of end-stage ischaemic heart disease due to severe coronary arterial stenosis, highlighting how cardiovascular MRI contributed to the management.
12151782	Early categorization abilities in young children with Williams syndrome.	The present study investigated whether 2- to 6-year-old children with Williams syndrome can form new object categories based on either visual or verbal information alone. Children were presented with six triads of objects. In each triad, two objects either shared visual properties, or were given the same name. Following the presentation of each triad, categorization based on the shared visual or verbal property was evaluated through object manipulation. While the children categorized the objects according to visual cues, they failed to use the verbal cues. These results contrast with previous research showing that typically developing toddlers, who were much younger than the children with Williams syndrome and much less advanced in their vocabulary development, could perform both types of categorization. The present study hence supports the claim that vocabulary acquisition in Williams syndrome develops atypically.
33653195	Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation outcomes in children with Williams syndrome: a review of the ELSO registry.	INTRODUCTION: Williams syndrome (WS) results from a microdeletion that usually involves the elastin gene, leading to generalized arteriopathy. Cardiovascular anomalies are seen in 80% of WS patients, including supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS), pulmonary artery stenosis (PAS), and pulmonary stenosis (PS). Sudden death associated with procedural sedation and in the perioperative period in WS children have been reported. This study aims to describe extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) use in WS children, identify risk factors for hospital mortality of WS patients, and compare outcomes between WS children and non-WS children with SVAS, PAS, and PS. METHODS: Children 0-18 years-old in the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) Registry with a primary or secondary diagnosis of WS, SVAS, PAS, or PAS were included. RESULTS: Included were 50 WS children and 1222 non-WS children with similar cardiac diagnoses. ECMO use increased over time in both groups (p = 0.93), with most cases occurring in the current era. WS children were younger (p = 0.004), weighed less (p = 0.048), had a pulmonary indication for ECMO (50% vs 10%, p < 0.001), and were placed more on high frequency ventilation (p < 0.001) than non-WS patients. Despite reporting a respiratory indication, most (84%) WS patients were placed on VA-ECMO. There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of pre-ECMO cardiac arrest, ECMO duration, or reason for ECMO discontinuation. Both groups had a mortality rate of 48% (p = 1.00). No risk factors for WS mortality were identified.
26012561	Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation for breath-holding spells followed by cardiac arrest due to left main coronary artery stenosis.	Non-syndromic congenital supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) leads to ventricular hypertrophy and increased oxygen consumption, and when combined with other factors reduces coronary blood flow, potentially resulting in myocardial ischemia and sudden cardiac death. While the anatomic obstruction of coronary circulation is as common in non-syndromic SVAS as in Williams syndrome, it often remains unacknowledged. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is an elective procedure that can be used to support patients with cardiac arrest during diagnosis as a way to reduce cardiopulmonary load in preparation for surgery or further treatment. In this report, we describe the rare case of an infant with severe SVAS and mild valvular pulmonary and left main coronary artery stenosis, as well as breath-holding spells. After multiple cardiac arrests, the infant underwent diagnostic catheter angiography on ECMO and had the pathology surgically corrected. 
30971606	Cardiac arrest after induction of anesthesia in a 2-month-old infant with undiagnosed Williams syndrome.	A 2-month-old male infant presented for elective repair of inguinal hernias. His preoperative medical history and physical examination were unremarkable. During induction of anesthesia, the infant sustained an adverse cardiac event. The event was characterized by tachycardia, hypotension, and massive ST-segment elevation. Despite vigorous resuscitation, spontaneous hemodynamic stability could not be achieved and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was required. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed severe hypoplasia of the ascending aorta. As effective cardiac function did not recover and there was evidence of diffuse ischemic brain injury, life support was withdrawn. Genetic testing performed postoperatively was definitive for Williams syndrome.
20961731	Abnormal processing of emotional prosody in Williams syndrome: an event-related potentials study.	Williams syndrome (WS), a neurodevelopmental genetic disorder due to a microdeletion in chromosome 7, is described as displaying an intriguing socio-cognitive phenotype. Deficits in prosody production and comprehension have been consistently reported in behavioral studies. It remains, however, to be clarified the neurobiological processes underlying prosody processing in WS. This study aimed at characterizing the electrophysiological response to neutral, happy, and angry prosody in WS, and examining if this response was dependent on the semantic content of the utterance. A group of 12 participants (5 female and 7 male), diagnosed with WS, with age range between 9 and 31 years, was compared with a group of typically developing participants, individually matched for chronological age, gender and laterality. After inspection of EEG artifacts, data from 9 participants with WS and 10 controls were included in ERP analyses. Participants were presented with neutral, positive and negative sentences, in two conditions: (1) with intelligible semantic and syntactic information; (2) with unintelligible semantic and syntactic information ('pure prosody' condition). They were asked to decide which emotion was underlying the auditory sentence. Atypical event-related potentials (ERP) components were related with prosodic processing (N100, P200, N300) in WS. In particular, reduced N100 was observed for prosody sentences with semantic content; more positive P200 for sentences with semantic content, in particular for happy and angry intonations; and reduced N300 for both types of sentence conditions. These findings suggest abnormalities in early auditory processing, indicating a bottom-up contribution to the impairment in emotional prosody processing and comprehension. Also, at least for N100 and P200, they suggest the top-down contributions of semantic processes in the sensory processing of speech. This study showed, for the first time, that abnormalities in ERP measures of early auditory processing in WS are also present during the processing of emotional vocal information. This may represent a physiological signature of underlying impaired on-line language and socio-emotional processing.
