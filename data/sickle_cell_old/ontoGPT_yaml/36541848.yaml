input_text: 'Delayed haemolytic transfusion reaction in paediatric patients with sickle
  cell disease: A retrospective study in a French national reference centre. Delayed
  haemolytic transfusion reaction (DHTR) is a life-threatening haemolytic anaemia
  following red blood cell transfusion in patients with sickle cell disease, with
  only scarce data in children. We retrospectively analysed 41 cases of DHTR in children
  treated between 2006 and 2020 in a French university hospital. DHTR manifested at
  a median age of 10.5 years, symptoms occurred a median of 8 days after transfusion
  performed for an acute event (63%), before surgery (20%) or in a chronic transfusion
  programme (17%). In all, 93% of patients had painful crisis. Profound anaemia (median
  49 g/L), low reticulocyte count (median 140 x109 /L) and increased lactate dehydrogenase
  (median 2239 IU/L) were observed. Antibody screening was positive in 51% of patients,
  and more frequent when there was a history of alloimmunisation. Although no deaths
  were reported, significant complications occurred in 51% of patients: acute chest
  syndrome (12 patients), cholestasis (five patients), stroke (two patients) and kidney
  failure (two patients). A further transfusion was required in 23 patients and corticosteroids
  were used in 21 to reduce the risk of additional haemolysis. In all, 13 patients
  subsequently received further transfusions with recurrence of DHTR in only two.
  The study affords a better overview of DHTR and highlights the need to establish
  guidelines for its management in children.'
