input_text: "Influenza Vaccination Receipt in Pediatric Patients With Cancer or Sickle
  Cell Disease. BACKGROUND: Influenza causes greater morbidity in children with cancer
  or sickle cell disease (SCD). Literature on influenza vaccination receipt for these
  populations is limited in low-vaccination states. Outpatient interventions improve
  vaccine receipt but isolated inpatient interventions remain unstudied. PROCEDURE:
  We reviewed influenza vaccine receipt of children with cancer or SCD treated at
  Children's Healthcare of Atlanta during three influenza seasons. We implemented
  a clinical decision support intervention during an influenza season and compared
  influenza vaccine receipt preintervention and postintervention among admitted children.
  RESULTS: The oncology cohort (N=1548, 60% to 62%) and the SCD cohort (N=2549, 61%
  to 65%) had similar-to-higher vaccination receipt to the United States (58% to 64%,
  P =0.01 to 0.79) and Georgia (51% to 56%, P <0.01). The intervention did not significantly
  improve vaccination receipt for admitted children with cancer (40% vs. 56%, P =0.05
  to 0.88) or SCD (44% vs. 56%, P =0.01). Regression modeling also found no significant
  increase in vaccine receipt (hematologic malignancy: 0.8 [0.73 to 0.98], solid tumor:
  0.9 [0.80 to 1.90], central nervous system tumor: 0.9 [0.71 to 1.14], SCD: 0.9 [0.85
  to 0.99]). CONCLUSIONS: Children with cancer and SCD have similar-to-greater influenza
  vaccination receipt compared with Georgia and the United States. An inpatient intervention
  did not significantly improve influenza vaccine receipt in these patient cohorts.
  Future studies are needed to identify alternative approaches to improving vaccine
  receipt in these cohorts."
