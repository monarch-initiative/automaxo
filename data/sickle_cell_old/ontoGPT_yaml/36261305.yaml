input_text: "A Novel Measure of Pain Location in Adults with Sickle Cell Disease.
  BACKGROUND: Pain intensity remains a primary focus clinically for sickle cell disease
  pain assessment despite the fact that pain quality and pain location and distribution
  are critical for clinical diagnosis and treatment of its etiology. However, in part
  because of measurement issues, scant evidence is available about pain location or
  its relationship to intensity and quality in adults with SCD. AIM: Our study aim
  was to examine sickle cell disease pain location for relationships with pain quality
  and intensity measured in outpatient and inpatient settings. METHODS: We used an
  existing longitudinal dataset prospectively collected with the valid and reliable
  tablet-based PAINReportIt(R). Adults with sickle cell disease (n = 99) reported
  pain location, intensity, and quality during a routine outpatient clinic visit and
  again during a subsequent hospitalization. From their digital body outline drawings
  and using the ImageJ software, we computed the pain-affected body surface area.
  With Pearson's correlations and paired t tests, we examined relationships between
  pain-affected body surface area and other pain variables across outpatient and inpatient
  visits. RESULTS: The mean pain-affected body surface area was 14.4% +- 15.0% of
  the total body surface area for outpatient visits (min-max: 0.0%-90.2%) and 13.5%
  +- 14.7% (min-max: 0.0%-73.0%) for inpatient stay. Pain-affected body surface area
  was positively correlated with pain quality scores for both visits but not significantly
  correlated with pain intensity at either visit. Compared with the outpatient visit,
  mean pain intensity for inpatient stay was higher (p < .001); pain quality (p =
  .12) and pain-affected body surface area (p = .60) did not differ significantly
  between visits. CONCLUSIONS: Unknown is the explanation for pain-affected body surface
  area association with SCD pain quality but not pain intensity at outpatient and
  inpatient visits. Additional research is warranted to explore these findings and
  examine the clinical utility of pain-affected body surface area for chronic sickle
  cell disease pain and acute sickle cell disease crisis pain."
