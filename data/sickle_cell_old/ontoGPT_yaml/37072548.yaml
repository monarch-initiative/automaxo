input_text: Advances in the Diagnosis and Treatment of Pediatric Arterial Ischemic
  Stroke. Though rare, stroke in infants and children is an important cause of mortality
  and chronic morbidity in the pediatric population. Neuroimaging advances and implementation
  of pediatric stroke care protocols have led to the ability to rapidly diagnose stroke
  and in many cases determine the stroke etiology. Though data on efficacy of hyperacute
  therapies, such as intravenous thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy, in pediatric
  stroke are limited, feasibility and safety data are mounting and support careful
  consideration of these treatments for childhood stroke. Recent therapeutic advances
  allow for targeted stroke prevention efforts in high-risk conditions, such as moyamoya,
  sickle cell disease, cardiac disease, and genetic disorders. Despite these exciting
  advances, important knowledge gaps persist, including optimal dosing and type of
  thrombolytic agents, inclusion criteria for mechanical thrombectomy, the role of
  immunomodulatory therapies for focal cerebral arteriopathy, optimal long-term antithrombotic
  strategies, the role of patent foramen ovale closure in pediatric stroke, and optimal
  rehabilitation strategies after stroke of the developing brain.
