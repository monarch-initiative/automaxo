input_text: Allogenic bone narrow transplantation in sickle-cell diseases. Sickle-cell
  diseases are the most common inherited hemoglobinopathies worldwide. Improvement
  in survival has been seen in the last decades with the introduction of careful screening
  and prevention of complications and the introduction of hydroxyurea. Stem-cell transplantation
  is currently the only curative option for these patients and has been indicated
  for patients with neurological events, repeated vaso-occlusive crisis, any organ
  damage or presence of red blood cell antibodies. Related bone-marrow or cord-blood
  transplant has shown an overall survival of more than 90% with a disease-free survival
  of 90% in 1,000 patients transplanted in the last decades. The use of unrelated
  donors unfortunately has not shown the same good results, but better typing methods
  and improved support may improve the outcome with this source of stem cells in the
  future. In Brazil, only recently stem cell transplant from related donors has been
  included in the procedures performed in the public health system. The use of related
  bone marrow or cord blood and a myeloablative conditioning regimen are considered
  standard of care for patients with sickle-cell diseases. Transplants with non-myeloablative
  regimens, unrelated donors or haploidentical donors should be performed only in
  controlled clinical trials.
