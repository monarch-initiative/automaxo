input_text: "Overnight auto-adjusting continuous airway pressure + standard care compared
  with standard care alone in the prevention of morbidity in sickle cell disease phase
  II (POMS2b): study protocol for a randomised controlled trial. BACKGROUND: In addition
  to pain, sickle cell anaemia (HbSS) complications include neurocognitive difficulties
  in attention and processing speed associated with low daytime and night-time oxygen
  saturation compounded by obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). In the general population
  OSA is treated with continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP). The aim of this
  single-blind, randomised, controlled phase II trial is to compare auto-adjusting
  CPAP (APAP) with standard care to standard care alone in individuals with HbSS to
  determine whether the intervention improves attention and processing speed, brain
  structure, pain and quality of life. METHODS/DESIGN: Eligibility criteria include:
  ability to provide informed consent; age > 8 years; diagnosis of HbSS; and mean
  overnight saturation of < 90% for < 30% of the night (i.e. not meeting current criteria
  for overnight oxygen therapy). Key exclusion criteria are: overnight respiratory
  support; respiratory or decompensated cardiac failure; chronic transfusion; or contraindications
  to APAP therapy or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Sixty individuals with HbSS
  (30 children and 30 adults) will be randomised to standard care + APAP or standard
  care alone for six months. Minimisation factors are: age group (8-11, 12-15, 16-22
  and > 23 years); silent infarction on MRI; minimum overnight oxygen saturation >
  90% or < 90%; and hydroxyurea use. For APAP individuals, the intervention is administered
  at home. Adherence and effectiveness are recorded using software documenting hours
  of use each night and overnight oximetry. Participant support in terms of appropriate
  facemask and facilitating adherence are provided by an unblinded sleep physiologist.
  The primary outcome is change in the cancellation subtest from the Wechsler scales.
  Secondary outcomes include general cognitive functioning, quantitative brain MRI,
  blood and urine chemistry, quality of life and daily pain via a smartphone App (GoMedSolutions,
  Inc) and, where possible MRI heart, echocardiography, and 6-min walk. These outcomes
  will be assessed at baseline and after six months of treatment by assessors blind
  to treatment assignment. DISCUSSION: Altering oxygen saturation in HbSS may lead
  to bone marrow suppression. This risk will be reduced by monitoring full blood counts
  at baseline, two weeks, three months and six months, providing treatment as appropriate
  and reporting as safety events. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN46012373 . Registered
