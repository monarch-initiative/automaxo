input_text: 'Good engraftment after reduced intensity targeted busulfan-based conditioning
  and matched related donor hematopoietic cell transplantation in hemoglobinopathies.
  BACKGROUND: Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is an established curative
  therapy for transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT) and sickle cell disease (SCD).
  The latest American Society of Hematology guidelines recommend myeloablative preparative
  regimen in patients under 18 years of age. PROCEDURE: The objective was to demonstrate
  safety and efficacy of a reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen including
  high-dose fludarabine, anti-thymocyte globulin, and targeted busulfan as a single
  alkylator to sub-myeloablative exposures. RESULTS: Between 2012 and 2021, 11 patients
  with SCD and five patients with TDT and matched related donor (MRD) HCT were included.
  The median age at transplantation was 8.3 years (range: 3.7-18.8 years). The median
  administered busulfan AUC was 67.4 mg/Lxh (range: 60.7-80 mg/Lxh). Overall survival
  was 93.8% and event-free survival 87.5% with one engrafted SCD patient with pre-existing
  moyamoya disease succumbing after drainage of a subdural hematoma. One SCD patient
  developed a secondary graft failure and was treated with a second HCT. Myeloid chimerism
  was full in all other patients with a median follow-up time of 4.1 years (range:
  2.0-11.1 years), whereas T-cell donor chimerism was frequently mixed. CONCLUSION:
  This RIC conditioning followed by MRD HCT is sufficiently myeloablative to cure
  pediatric patients with hemoglobinopathies without the need for additional total
  body irradiation or thiotepa.'
