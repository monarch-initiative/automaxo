input_text: 'CRISPR-Based Gene Therapies: From Preclinical to Clinical Treatments.
  In recent years, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs)
  and CRISPR-associated (Cas) protein have emerged as a revolutionary gene editing
  tool to treat inherited disorders affecting different organ systems, such as blood
  and muscles. Both hematological and neuromuscular genetic disorders benefit from
  genome editing approaches but face different challenges in their clinical translation.
  The ability of CRISPR/Cas9 technologies to modify hematopoietic stem cells ex vivo
  has greatly accelerated the development of genetic therapies for blood disorders.
  In the last decade, many clinical trials were initiated and are now delivering encouraging
  results. The recent FDA approval of Casgevy, the first CRISPR/Cas9-based drug for
  severe sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia, represents
  a significant milestone in the field and highlights the great potential of this
  technology. Similar preclinical efforts are currently expanding CRISPR therapies
  to other hematologic disorders such as primary immunodeficiencies. In the neuromuscular
  field, the versatility of CRISPR/Cas9 has been instrumental for the generation of
  new cellular and animal models of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), offering innovative
  platforms to speed up preclinical development of therapeutic solutions. Several
  corrective interventions have been proposed to genetically restore dystrophin production
  using the CRISPR toolbox and have demonstrated promising results in different DMD
  animal models. Although these advances represent a significant step forward to the
  clinical translation of CRISPR/Cas9 therapies to DMD, there are still many hurdles
  to overcome, such as in vivo delivery methods associated with high viral vector
  doses, together with safety and immunological concerns. Collectively, the results
  obtained in the hematological and neuromuscular fields emphasize the transformative
  impact of CRISPR/Cas9 for patients affected by these debilitating conditions. As
  each field suffers from different and specific challenges, the clinical translation
  of CRISPR therapies may progress differentially depending on the genetic disorder.
  Ongoing investigations and clinical trials will address risks and limitations of
  these therapies, including long-term efficacy, potential genotoxicity, and adverse
  immune reactions. This review provides insights into the diverse applications of
  CRISPR-based technologies in both preclinical and clinical settings for monogenic
  blood disorders and muscular dystrophy and compare advances in both fields while
  highlighting current trends, difficulties, and challenges to overcome.'
