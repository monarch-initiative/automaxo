input_text: 'Practice patterns for neuroimaging and transfusion therapy for management
  of neurologic complications in sickle cell anemia: DISPLACE consortium. BACKGROUND:
  Children with sickle cell anemia (SCA) are at risk for neurologic complications
  (stroke and silent cerebral infarct). The 2014 National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute
  (NHLBI) guidelines for sickle cell disease include recommendations for initiation
  and maintenance of chronic red cell transfusion (CRCT) therapy for children with
  SCA at risk for or with ischemic stroke. The guidelines do not include well-delineated
  recommendations for cerebral imaging for stroke screening. The purpose of this study
  was to evaluate current stroke risk screening, prevention, and intervention practices
  amongst the Dissemination and Implementation of Stroke Prevention Looking at the
  Care Environment (DISPLACE) study sites. PROCEDURE: A survey was administered to
  DISPLACE site principal investigators to identify current stroke prevention practices
  relative to the Stroke Prevention Trial in Sickle Cell Anemia (STOP) study protocols
  and the 2014 NHLBI guidelines. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and
  line-by-line analysis of comments. RESULTS: Sites consistently applied NHLBI recommendations
  to initiate CRCT for ischemic stroke and abnormal transcranial Doppler ultrasound
  (TCD) results. Similarly, nearly all sites reported obtaining an magnetic resonance
  imaging (MRI)/magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) following an abnormal TCD result.
  There was wide variation for other indications for MRI/MRA, frequency of MRI/MRA,
  and other neurological indications for initiating CRCT. CONCLUSIONS: Guideline-based
  practices for preventing ischemic stroke through TCD and CRCT initiation were evident
  in nearly all sites. Wide variation in practices pertaining to MRI/MRA exists, potentially
  influenced by more recent stroke prevention trials. New guidelines from the American
  Society of Hematology were published in April 2020, which may reduce practice variation.'
