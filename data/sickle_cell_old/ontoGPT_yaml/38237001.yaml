input_text: "Perspectives of Adolescents and Young Adults With Sickle Cell Disease
  and Clinicians on Improving Transition Readiness With a Video Game Intervention.
  We aimed to learn the experiences of clinicians and adolescents and young adults
  with sickle cell disease (AYA-SCD) with managing their disease at home and making
  medical decisions as they transition from pediatric to adult care, and their perceptions
  of a video game intervention to positively impact these skills. We conducted individual,
  semistructured interviews with patients (AYA-SCD ages 15 to 26 years) and clinicians
  who provide care to AYA-SCD at an urban, quaternary-care hospital. Interviews elicited
  patients' and clinicians' experiences with AYA-SCD, barriers and facilitators to
  successful home management, and their perspectives on shared decision-making and
  a video game intervention. To identify themes, we conducted an inductive analysis
  until data saturation was reached. Participants (16 patients and 21 clinicians)
  identified 4 main themes: (1) self-efficacy as a critical skill for a successful
  transition from pediatric to adult care, (2) the importance of patient engagement
  in making medical decisions, (3) multilevel determinants of optimal self-efficacy
  and patient engagement, and (4) support for a video game intervention which, by
  targeting potential determinants of AYA-SCD achieving optimal self-efficacy and
  engagement in decision-making, may improve these important skills."
