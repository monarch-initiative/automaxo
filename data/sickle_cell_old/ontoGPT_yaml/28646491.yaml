input_text: Sickle cells produce functional immune modulators and cytotoxics. Sickle
  erythrocytes' (SSRBCs) unique physical adaptation to hypoxic conditions renders
  them able to home to hypoxic tumor niches in vivo, shut down tumor blood flow and
  induce tumoricidal responses. SSRBCs are also useful vehicles for transport of encapsulated
  drugs and oncolytic virus into hypoxic tumors with enhanced anti-tumor effects.
  In search of additional modes for arming sickle cells with cytotoxics, we turned
  to a lentiviral beta-globin vector with optimized Locus Control Region/beta-globin
  coding region/promoter/enhancers. We partially replaced the beta-globin coding region
  of this vector with genes encoding T cell cytolytics, perforin and granzyme or immune
  modulating superantigens SEG and SEI. These modified vectors efficiently transduced
  Sca+ ckit- Lin- hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from humanized sickle cell knockin
  mice. Irradiated mice reconstituted with these HSCs displayed robust expression
  of transgenic RNAs and proteins in host sickle cells that was sustained for more
  than 10 months. SSRBCs from reconstituted mice harboring SEG/SEI transgenes induced
  robust proliferation and a prototypical superantigen-induced cytokine reaction when
  exposed to human CD4+/CD8+ cells. The beta-globin lentiviral vector therefore produces
  a high level of functional, erythroid-specific immune modulators and cytotoxics
  that circulate without toxicity. Coupled with their unique ability to target and
  occlude hypoxic tumor vessels these armed SSRBCs constitute a potentially useful
  tool for treatment of solid tumors.
