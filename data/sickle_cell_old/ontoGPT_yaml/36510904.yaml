input_text: 'Impact of hydroxyurea on hospital stay & analgesic utilization in sickle
  cell anaemia with vaso-occlusive crises. Background & objectives: Hydroxyurea (HU)
  has been useful in preventing sickle cell vaso-occlusive crises (VOC). A few studies
  also suggest utility of HU, during acute VOC. Sickle cell anaemia (SCA) is of high
  prevalence in western districts of Odisha State, India, and VOC is a common presentation,
  despite being mostly of Arab-Indian haplotype. This study was undertaken to evaluate
  the impact of HU on hospital stay and analgesic utilization in acute painful VOC
  of SCA. Methods: Homozygous sickle cell disease (HbSS) patients were categorized
  as cases who were receiving low-dose HU (10 mg/kg/day) and patients who were not
  on HU were considered as control. Days of hospital stay, analgesic utilization and
  visual analogue scale (VAS) score in patients were compared with that of control.
  Analgesics used to control pain were tramadol hydrochloride, ketorolac and diclofenac.
  Results: A total of 359 homozygous sickle cell disease (SCD) patients with VOC were
  studied (187 patients and 172 controls). The patient group had lesser mean days
  of hospital stay (1.4 days less than controls, P<0.001) and required lesser days
  of analgesic utilization than controls (1.18 days less than controls, P<0.001).
  Significant differences were observed between patients and controls concerning VAS
  score and amount of tramadol hydrochloride, ketorolac and diclofenac utilization
  (P<0.05). Interpretation & conclusions: In this study, HU was found to have beneficial
  effects in acute VOC of homozygous SCD, which includes shortening the duration of
  hospital stay and reducing the net amount of analgesic utilization during hospitalization.'
