input_text: 'Sickle Cell Trait and SARS-CoV-2-Induced Rhabdomyolysis: A Case Report.
  BACKGROUND Rhabdomyolysis is a syndrome characterized by muscle necrosis and the
  subsequent release of intracellular muscle constituents into the bloodstream. Although
  the specific cause is frequently evident from the history or from the immediate
  events, such as a trauma, extraordinary physical exertion, or a recent infection,
  sometimes there are hidden risk factors that have to be identified. For instance,
  individuals with sickle cell trait (SCT) have been reported to be at increased risk
  for rare conditions, including rhabdomyolysis. Moreover, there have been a few case
  reports of SARS-CoV-2 infection-related rhabdomyolysis. CASE REPORT We present a
  case of a patient affected by unknown SCT and admitted with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia,
  who suffered non-traumatic non-exertional rhabdomyolysis leading to acute kidney
  injury (AKI), requiring acute hemodialysis (HD). The patients underwent 13 dialysis
  session, of which 12 were carried out using an HFR-Supra H dialyzer. He underwent
  kidney biopsy, where rhabdomyolysis injury was ascertained. No viral traces were
  found on kidney biopsy samples. The muscle biopsy showed the presence of an "open
  nucleolus" in the muscle cell, which was consistent with virus-infected cells. After
  40 days in the hospital, his serum creatinine was 1.62 mg/dL and CPK and Myoglobin
  were 188 U/L and 168 ng/mL, respectively; therefore, the patient was discharged.
  CONCLUSIONS SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in severe rhabdomyolysis with AKI requiring
  acute HD. Since SARS-CoV-2 infection can trigger sickle-related complications like
  rhabdomyolysis, the presence of SCT needs to be ascertained in African patients.'
