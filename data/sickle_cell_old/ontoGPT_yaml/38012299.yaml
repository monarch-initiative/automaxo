input_text: 'Looking ahead: ethical and social challenges of somatic gene therapy
  for sickle cell disease in Africa. Somatic gene therapy will be one of the most
  exciting practices of genetic medicine in Africa and is primed to offer a "new life"
  for persons living with sickle cell disease (SCD). Recently, successful gene therapy
  trials for SCD in the USA have sparked a ray of hope within the SCD community in
  Africa. However, the high cost, estimated to exceed 1.5 million USD, continues to
  be a major concern for many stakeholders. While affordability is a key global health
  equity consideration, it is equally important to reflect on other ethical, legal
  and social issues (ELSIs) that may impact the responsible implementation of gene
  therapy for SCD in Africa. These include informed consent comprehension, risk of
  therapeutic misestimation and optimistic bias; priorities for SCD therapy trials;
  dearth of ethical and regulatory oversight for gene therapy in many African countries;
  identifying a favourable risk-benefit ratio; criteria for the selection of trial
  participants; decisional conflict in consent; standards of care; bounded justice;
  and genetic tourism. Given these ELSIs, we suggest that researchers, pharma, funders,
  global health agencies, ethics committees, science councils and SCD patient support/advocacy
  groups should work together to co-develop: (1) patient-centric governance for gene
  therapy in Africa, (2) public engagement and education materials, and (3) decision
  making toolkits for trial participants. It is also critical to establish harmonised
  ethical and regulatory frameworks for gene therapy in Africa, and for global health
  agencies to accelerate access to basic care for SCD in Africa, while simultaneously
  strengthening capacity for gene therapy.'
