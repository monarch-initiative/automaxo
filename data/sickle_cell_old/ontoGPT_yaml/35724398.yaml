input_text: COVID19 vaccination in adults with sickle cell disease is not associated
  with increases in rates of pain crisis. ABSTRACTPeople with sickle cell disease
  (SCD) are more vulnerable to hospitalization, pneumonia, and pain following COVID-19
  infection. However, given the association between the inflammatory response and
  vaso-occlusive crises in SCD and a case report of vaso-occlusive crises following
  administration of the ChAdOx1 nCov-195-7/AstraZeneca vaccine, there is concern that
  the administration of COVID-19 vaccines in people with SCD might provoke a vaso-occlusive
  crisis. To address this critical gap in knowledge, we sought to examine acute care
  usage for vaso-occlusive crisis and frequency and severity of side effects following
  COVID-19 vaccination among patients at the Montefiore Sickle Cell Center for Adults.
  As part of regular care, patients were asked if they had received COVID-19 vaccination
  and any side effects were noted. Electronic medical records were reviewed for the
  type of vaccine, dates received, episodes of vaso-occlusive crises within seven
  days of a dose, and side effects noted. The risk of average hospital utilization
  per week in 2019 was calculated as a baseline. We found that fewer than 1 in 10
  patients presented to the hospital within seven days of vaccination and that the
  risk of hospital utilization was similar to the average risk in a week in 2019.
  Of patients who reported side effects, one reported a possible case of sensorineural
  hearing loss otherwise no other rare side effects, including thrombosis or death,
  were reported.
