input_text: Gene therapy for hemoglobinopathies. Beta hemoglobinopathies such as sickle
  cell disease (SCD) and beta-thalassemia (BT) are the most common monogenic diseases
  worldwide. Both diseases are associated with significant morbidity and mortality.
  Because patients require lifelong follow-up and care, it also poses a serious burden
  in health services. Blood transfusions and/or drug therapy ameliorate the signs
  and symptoms of the disorders but are not curative. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell
  transplantation (HCT) is currently the only cure but it has several limitations
  including the paucity of human leukocyte antigen-matched related donors and a high
  risk of adverse events. Recent advances in hematopoietic stem cell based-gene therapy
  has made autologous HCT (auto-HCT) a reality. Clinical trials are underway using
  different gene transfer vectors and cassettes. Data obtained so far with a short-term
  follow-up has been very encouraging. Patients with SCD engrafted, had sustained
  production of the transgene and a decreased number of vaso-occlusive crises. Patients
  with BT were able to decrease the amount of transfusions required or stop transfusions
  all together. Adverse events observed were mostly associated with the myeloablative
  conditioning regimen. Long term data on gene persistence and toxicities are still
  needed. This review focuses on the current state of auto-HCT with gene therapy for
  SCD and BT. Current clinical trials and their outcome results are summarized.
