input_text: How I treat sickle cell disease with hematopoietic cell transplantation.
  Sickle cell disease (SCD) leads to significant morbidity and early mortality, and
  hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is the only widely available cure, with
  impacts seen on SCD-related organ dysfunction. Outcomes are excellent following
  matched-related donor (MRD) HCT, leading to significantly expanded application of
  this treatment over the past decade. The majority of SCD patients lack an MRD, but
  outcomes following alternative donor HCT continue to improve on clinical trials.
  Within this framework, we aim to provide our perspective on how to apply research
  findings to clinical practice, for an individual patient. We also emphasize that
  the preparation of SCD recipients for HCT and supporting them through HCT have special
  nuances that require awareness and close attention. Through the use of clinical
  vignettes, we provide our perpsective on the complex decision-making process in
  HCT for SCD as well as recommendations for the evaluation and support of these patients
  through HCT.
