input_text: 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant for Sickle Cell Disease: PATIENT SELEction
  and Timing Based on Sickle Cell-Related Multiple Chronic Conditions. Hematopoietic
  stem cell transplant (HSCT) is the only cure for patients with sickle cell disease
  (SCD). Although most SCD patients experience progressive end-organ damage and shortened
  lifespans, not all patients follow the same disease course, tempo, or outcome. Therefore,
  the dilemma facing physicians is weighing the selection of patients and timing for
  the procedure against donor type and transplant-related mortality and morbidity
  that go up with increasing age. On the other hand, the dilemma facing the patients
  and families is how acceptable HSCT that carries some mortality risks to them. We
  have analyzed the chronic conditions due to SCD in 449 patients to determine whether
  SCD-related multiple chronic conditions (MCC) can be risk-stratified to identify
  the group of patients predicted to not only have shortened lifespans but also functional
  limitation and poor quality of life so that these at-risk patients can be offered
  HSCT early and before MCC develops. We identified that the age of onset of the first
  SCD-related chronic conditions strongly predicted for the risks for disease-related
  MCC. SCD patients who suffered their first disease-related chronic condition before
  age 30 years developed MCC at a rate of 19.1 times faster than those at a later
  age. These patients are therefore high-risk patients and should be offered HSCT
  early in the course of their disease before multiple organ damage intervenes, even
  if matched-related donors are not available. This patient selection and timing approach
  provides a forum for an easy-to-understand and real-time discussion, including the
  choice of donor type, with SCD patients and families when considering HSCT.'
