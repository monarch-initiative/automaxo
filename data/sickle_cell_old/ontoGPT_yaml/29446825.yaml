input_text: "Phytomedicines (medicines derived from plants) for sickle cell disease.
  BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease, a common recessively inherited haemoglobin disorder,
  affects people from sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, Mediterranean basin, Indian
  subcontinent, Caribbean and South America. It is associated with complications and
  a reduced life expectancy. Phytomedicines (medicine derived from plants in their
  original state) encompass many of the plant remedies from traditional healers which
  the populations most affected would encounter. Laboratory research and limited clinical
  trials have suggested positive effects of phytomedicines both in vivo and in vitro.
  However, there has been little systematic appraisal of their benefits. This is an
  update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2004, and updated in 2010, 2013,
  and 2015. OBJECTIVES: To assess the benefits and risks of phytomedicines in people
  with sickle cell disease of all types, of any age, in any setting. SEARCH METHODS:
  We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies
  Trials Register, the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number Register
  (ISRCTN), the Allied and Complimentary Medicine Database (AMED), ClinicalTrials.gov
  and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform
  (ICTRP).Dates of most recent searches: Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders
  Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 10 April 2017; ISRCTN: 26 July 2017; AMED:
  24 August 2017; ClinicalTrials.gov: 02 August 2017; and the WHO ICTRP: 27 July 2017.
  SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised or quasi-randomised trials with participants of all
  ages with sickle cell disease, in all settings, comparing the administration of
  phytomedicines, by any mode to placebo or conventional treatment, including blood
  transfusion and hydroxyurea. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Both authors independently
  assessed trial quality and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: Two trials (182 participants)
  and two phytomedicines Niprisan  (also known as Nicosan ) and Ciklavit  were included.
  The Phase IIB (pivotal) trial suggests that Niprisan  was effective in reducing
  episodes of severe painful sickle cell disease crisis over a six-month period (low-quality
  evidence). It did not affect the risk of severe complications or the level of anaemia
  (low-quality evidence). No serious adverse effects were reported. The single trial
  of Cajanus cajan (Ciklavit ) reported a possible benefit to individuals with painful
  crises (low-quality evidence), and a possible adverse effect (non-significant) on
  the level of anaemia (low-quality evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: While Niprisan\
  \  appeared to be safe and effective in reducing severe painful crises over a six-month
  follow-up period, further trials are required to assess its role in the management
  of people with sickle cell disease and the results of its multicentre trials are
  awaited. Currently no conclusions can be made regarding the efficacy of Ciklavit
  . Based on the published results for Niprisan  and in view of the limitations in
  data collection and analysis of both trials, phytomedicines may have a potential
  beneficial effect in reducing painful crises in sickle cell disease. This needs
  to be further validated in future trials. More trials are required on the safety
  and efficacy of phytomedicines used in managing sickle cell disease."
