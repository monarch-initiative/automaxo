input_text: "Attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccine among pediatric patients with sickle
  cell disease and their caregivers. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate attitudes toward vaccination
  and vaccine uptake regarding coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among pediatric
  patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and their caregivers. PROCEDURE: Adolescent
  patients and caregivers of children with SCD were surveyed during routine clinic
  visits; we then conducted a logistic regression analysis to understand differences
  in vaccine status, while qualitative responses were coded thematically. RESULTS:
  Among respondents, the overall vaccination rate among adolescents and caregivers
  was 49% and 52%, respectively. Among the unvaccinated, 60% and 68% of adolescents
  and caregivers, respectively, preferred to remain unvaccinated, most commonly due
  to lack of perceived personal benefit from vaccination or mistrust in the vaccine.
  Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that child's age (odds ratio [OR]
  = 1.1, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.0-1.2, p < .01) and caregiver education (measured
  by the Economic Hardship Index [EHI] score, OR = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.74-0.78, p < .05)
  were independent predictors of getting vaccinated. CONCLUSION: Despite the increased
  risk of severe illness due to COVID-19 in patients with SCD, vaccine hesitancy remains
  high in this population of families whose children have SCD. Fortunately, the reasons
  cited for deferring vaccination among those who are unvaccinated were largely due
  to barriers that may be overcome with quality communication around the utility of
  the vaccine and information about vaccine safety."
