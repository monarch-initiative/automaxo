input_text: "Psychological therapies (remotely delivered) for the management of chronic
  and recurrent pain in children and adolescents. BACKGROUND: This is the first update
  of a review published in 2015, Issue 1. Chronic pain is common during childhood
  and adolescence and is associated with negative outcomes, such as increased severity
  of pain, reduced function, and low mood. Psychological therapies, traditionally
  delivered face-to-face with a therapist, are efficacious at reducing pain intensity
  and disability. To address barriers to treatment access, such as distance and cost
  of treatment, technology is being used to deliver these psychological therapies
  remotely. Therapies delivered remotely, such as via the Internet, computer-based
  programmes, and smartphone applications, can be used to deliver treatment to children
  and adolescents with chronic pain. OBJECTIVES: To determine the efficacy of psychological
  therapies delivered remotely compared to waiting list, treatment as usual, or active
  control treatments, for the management of chronic pain in children and adolescents.
  SEARCH METHODS: We searched four databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO)
  from inception to May 2018 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of remotely-delivered
  psychological interventions for children and adolescents with chronic pain. We searched
  for chronic pain conditions including, but not exclusive to, headache, recurrent
  abdominal pain, musculoskeletal pain, and neuropathic pain. We also searched online
  trial registries, reference sections, and citations of included studies for potential
  trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included RCTs that investigated the efficacy of a
  psychological therapy delivered remotely via technology in comparison to an active,
  treatment as usual, or waiting-list control. We considered blended treatments, which
  used a combination of technology and up to 30% face-to-face interaction. Interventions
  had to be delivered primarily via technology to be included, and we excluded interventions
  delivered via telephone. We included studies that delivered interventions to children
  and adolescents (up to 18 years of age) with a chronic pain condition or where chronic
  pain was a primary symptom of their condition (e.g. juvenile arthritis). We included
  studies that reported 10 or more participants in each comparator arm, at each extraction
  point. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We combined all psychological therapies in
  the analyses. We split pain conditions into headache and mixed (non-headache) pain
  and analysed them separately. We extracted pain severity/intensity, disability,
  depression, anxiety, and adverse events as primary outcomes, and satisfaction with
  treatment as a secondary outcome. We considered outcomes at two time points: first
  immediately following the end of treatment (known as 'post-treatment'), and second,
  any follow-up time point post-treatment between three and 12 months (known as 'follow-up').
  We assessed risk of bias and all outcomes for quality using the GRADE assessment.
  MAIN RESULTS: We found 10 studies with 697 participants (an additional 4 studies
  with 326 participants since the previous review) that delivered treatment remotely;
  four studies investigated children with headache conditions, one study was with
  children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis, one included children with sickle cell
  disease, one included children with irritable bowel syndrome, and three studies
  included children with different chronic pain conditions (i.e. headache, recurrent
  abdominal pain, musculoskeletal pain). The average age of children receiving treatment
  was 13.17 years.We judged selection, detection, and reporting biases to be mostly
  low risk. However, we judged performance and attrition biases to be mostly unclear.
  Out of the 16 planned analyses, we were able to conduct 13 meta-analyses. We downgraded
  outcomes for imprecision, indirectness of evidence, inconsistency of results, or
  because the analysis only included one study.Headache conditionsFor headache pain
  conditions, we found headache severity was reduced post-treatment (risk ratio (RR)
  2.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.35 to 3.01); P < 0.001, number needed to treat
  to benefit (NNTB) = 5.36, 7 studies, 379 participants; very low-quality evidence).
  No effect was found at follow-up (very low-quality evidence). There were no effects
  of psychological therapies delivered remotely for disability post-treatment (standardised
  mean difference (SMD) -0.16, 95% CI -0.46 to 0.13; P = 0.28, 5 studies, 440 participants)
  or follow-up (both very low-quality evidence). Similarly, no effect was found for
  the outcomes of depression (SMD -0.04, 95% CI -0.15 to 0.23, P = 0.69, 4 studies,
  422 participants) or anxiety (SMD -0.08, 95% CI -0.28 to 0.12; P = 0.45, 3 studies,
  380 participants) at post-treatment, or follow-up (both very low-quality evidence).Mixed
  chronic pain conditionsWe did not find any beneficial effects of psychological therapies
  for reducing pain intensity post-treatment for mixed chronic pain conditions (SMD
  -0.90, 95% CI -1.95 to 0.16; P = 0.10, 5 studies, 501 participants) or at follow-up.
  There were no beneficial effects of psychological therapies delivered remotely for
  disability post-treatment (SMD -0.28, 95% CI -0.74 to 0.18; P = 0.24, 3 studies,
  363 participants) and a lack of data at follow-up meant no analysis could be run.
  We found no beneficial effects for the outcomes of depression (SMD 0.04, 95% CI
  -0.18 to 0.26; P = 0.73, 2 studies, 317 participants) and anxiety (SMD 0.53, 95%
  CI -0.63 to 1.68; P = 0.37, 2 studies, 370 participants) post-treatment, however,
  we are cautious of our findings as we could only include two studies in the analyses.
  We could not conduct analyses at follow-up. We judged the evidence for all outcomes
  to be very low quality.All conditionsAcross all chronic pain conditions, six studies
  reported minor adverse events which were not attributed to the psychological therapies.
  Satisfaction with treatment is described qualitatively and was overall positive.
  However, we judged both these outcomes as very low quality. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS:
  There are currently a small number of trials investigating psychological therapies
  delivered remotely, primarily via the Internet. We are cautious in our interpretations
  of analyses. We found one beneficial effect of therapies to reduce headache severity
  post-treatment. For the remaining outcomes there was either no beneficial effect
  at post-treatment or follow-up, or lack of evidence to determine an effect. Overall,
  participant satisfaction with treatment was positive. We judged the quality of the
  evidence to be very low, meaning we are very uncertain about the estimate. Further
  studies are needed to increase our confidence in this potentially promising field."
