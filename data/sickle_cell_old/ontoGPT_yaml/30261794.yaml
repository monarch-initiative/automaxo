input_text: 'Adaptation of a microbead assay for the easy evaluation of traditional
  anti-sickling medicines: application to DREPANOSTAT and FACA. CONTEXT: Sickle cell
  disease is a common inherited blood disorder affecting millions of people worldwide.
  Due to lack of progress in drug discovery for a suitable treatment, sufferers often
  turn to traditional medicines that take advantage of the plant extracts activity
  used by traditional healers. OBJECTIVE: This study optimizes an anti-sickling screening
  test to identify preparations capable of reverting sickle cells back to the morphology
  of normal red blood cells. We focused on the miniaturization and practicability
  of the assay, so that it can be adapted to the laboratory conditions commonly found
  in less developed countries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We tested two traditional anti-sickling
  herbal medicines, FACA  and DREPANOSTAT , composed of Zanthoxylum zanthoxyloides
  (Lam.) Zepern. & Timler (Rutaceae) and Calotropis procera (Aiton) Dryand. (Apocynaceae)
  at screening concentrations of hydroethanol extracts from 0.2 to 1 mg/mL. Potential
  bioactive molecules present in the extracts were profiled using Ultra High Performance
  Liquid Chromatography coupled with High Resolution Mass Spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS/MS)
  method, identified through HRMS, MS/MS spectra and in silico fragmentation tools.
  RESULTS: Hydroethanol extracts of FACA  and DREPANOSTAT  showed low anti-sickling
  activity, inhibiting less than 10% of the sickling process. The UHPLC-HRMS/MS profiles
  identified 28 compounds (18 in FACA  and 15 in DREPANOSTAT , including common compounds)
  among which l-phenylalanine is already described as potential anti-sickling agent.
  When used as positive control, 7 mg/mL phenylalanine reduced the sickled RBC to
  52%. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: This assay has been optimized for the easy screening
  of plant extracts or extracted compounds from bioassay guided fractionation, valuable
  to laboratories from less developed countries.'
