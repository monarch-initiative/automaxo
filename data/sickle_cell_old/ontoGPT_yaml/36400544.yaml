input_text: The Evolving Landscape of Drug Therapies for Sickle Cell Disease. Although
  sickle cell disease can be cured using allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
  and possibly gene therapy and gene editing, these treatments remain unavailable
  to most patients. As understanding of the disease pathophysiology increases, progress
  is being made in developing drug therapies. Hydroxyurea, l-glutamine, crizanlizumab,
  and voxelotor are currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, with
  multiple others at various stages of testing. With the limited efficacy of individual
  agents, combinations of agents will likely be required for optimal outcomes. Clinical
  and surrogate endpoints, other than vaso-occlusive crisis, are increasingly being
  considered in the evaluation of novel drugs.
