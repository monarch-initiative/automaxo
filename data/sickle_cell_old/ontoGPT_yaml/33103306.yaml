input_text: 'The haemoglobinopathy survey: The reality of transfusion practice in
  sickle cell disease and thalassaemia in England. OBJECTIVES: To establish, in an
  unselected population of London haemoglobinopathy patients, transfusion requirements,
  blood antigens/alloantibodies, transfusion modalities, burden of transfusion reactions
  and donor exposure. BACKGROUND: Haemoglobinopathy patients are among the most highly
  transfused patient populations, and the overall population and number of patients
  on long-term transfusion programmes are increasing. To provide a safe and efficacious
  transfusion service for patients, it is important to understand current practice,
  morbidity associated with transfusion, efficacy of different transfusion modalities
  and geno-/phenotype requirements. METHODS: Data on 4451 transfusion episodes in
  760 patients from 12 London hospitals were collected retrospectively over a 6-month
  period in 2011. RESULTS: Alloimmunisation prevalence was 17% for sickle cell disease
  (SCD) and 22% for thalassaemia, most commonly anti-Rh/Kell/Kpa /Cw . Rh phenotypes
  differed between SCD (Ro r 59.8%/R1 r 15.9%/R2 r 15.6%) and thalassaemia (R1 R1
  29.6%/R1 r 28.4%/R1 R2 15.4%). Recording of pheno-/genotypes fell below recommendations.
  A 2-weekly manual exchange and 3-weekly automated exchange came closest to achieving
  presumptive targets. In adults with thalassaemia, the mean blood requirement was
  36 units per year; for SCD, erythrocytapheresis was carried out every 7 weeks with
  66 units; for manual exchange, it was 38 units every 4 weeks; and for simple transfusion,
  it was 30 units p.a. every 4 weeks. CONCLUSION: Transfusion modality choice was
  influenced by the resources available-children mostly received simple transfusions,
  and adults received erythrocytapheresis; the relationships between frequency of
  exchanges/transfusion modality/target HbA% were not simple, possibly reflecting
  the difference in recipient erythropoiesis and consequent transfusion modality selection
  bias; adherence to existing and current guidelines regarding geno-/phenotyping was
  limited; and alloimmunisation had a low incidence and high prevalence in both disorders.'
