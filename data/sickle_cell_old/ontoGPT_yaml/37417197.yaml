input_text: 'Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of an oral formulation of decitabine
  and tetrahydrouridine. BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is caused by an inherited
  structural abnormality of adult hemoglobin causing polymerization. Fetal hemoglobin
  interferes with polymerization but is epigenetically silenced by DNA methyltransferase
  1 (DNMT1) in adult erythropoiesis. Decitabine depletes DNMT1 and increases fetal
  and total hemoglobin in SCD patients, but is rapidly catabolized by cytidine deaminase
  (CDA) in vivo. Tetrahydrouridine (THU) inhibits CDA, safeguarding decitabine. METHODS:
  The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of three oral combination formulations
  of THU and decitabine, with different coatings producing different delays in decitabine
  release, were investigated in healthy participants. RESULTS: Tetrahydrouridine and
  decitabine were rapidly absorbed into the systemic circulation after a single combination
  oral dose, with relative bioavailability of decitabine >=74% in fasted males compared
  with separate oral administration of THU followed by decitabine 1 h later. THU and
  decitabine Cmax and area under the plasma concentration versus time curve were higher
  in females versus males, and fasted versus fed states. Despite sex and food effect
  on pharmacokinetics, the pharmacodynamic effect of DNMT1 downregulation was comparable
  in males and females and fasted and fed states. Treatments were well tolerated.
  CONCLUSION: Combination oral formulations of THU with decitabine produced pharmacokinetics
  and pharmacodynamics suitable for oral DNMT1-targeted therapy.'
