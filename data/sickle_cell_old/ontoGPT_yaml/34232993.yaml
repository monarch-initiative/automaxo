input_text: 'Gene therapy for sickle cell disease: moving from the bench to the bedside.
  Gene therapy as a potential cure for sickle cell disease (SCD) has long been pursued,
  given that this hemoglobin (Hb) disorder results from a single point mutation. Advances
  in genomic sequencing have increased the understanding of Hb regulation, and discoveries
  of molecular tools for genome modification of hematopoietic stem cells have made
  gene therapy for SCD possible. Gene-addition strategies using gene transfer vectors
  have been optimized over the past few decades to increase expression of normal or
  antisickling globins as strategies to ameliorate SCD. Many hurdles had to be addressed
  before clinical translation, including collecting sufficient stem cells for gene
  modification, increasing expression of transferred genes to a therapeutic level,
  and conditioning patients in a safe manner that enabled adequate engraftment of
  gene-modified cells. The discovery of genome editors that make precise modifications
  has further advanced the safety and efficacy of gene therapy, and a rapid movement
  to clinical trial has undoubtedly been supported by lessons learned from optimizing
  gene-addition strategies. Current gene therapies being tested in clinical trial
  require significant infrastructure and expertise, given that cells must be harvested
  from and chemotherapy administered to patients who often have significant organ
  dysfunction and that gene-modification takes place ex vivo in specialized facilities.
  For these therapies to realize their full potential, they would have to be portable,
  safe, and efficient, to make an in vivo-based approach attractive. In addition,
  adequate resources for SCD screening and access to standardized care are critically
  important for gene therapy to be a viable treatment option for SCD.'
