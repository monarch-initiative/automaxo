input_text: 'Sickle Cell Crises in Pregnancy: Fetal and Neonatal Implications. Sickle
  cell disease (SCD) is the most common inherited condition worldwide. In the United
  States, SCD affects 100,000 births every year, mostly persons of African descent.
  In SCD, red blood cells assume a sickle shape when deoxygenated. This leads to the
  occlusion of small blood vessels and decreased oxygenated blood flow, resulting
  in ischemic and thrombotic injury to various organs, which further leads to organ
  dysfunction. In pregnancy, patients with SCD are at an increased risk of vaso-occlusive
  crises, which further increases the risks of maternal, fetal, and neonatal morbidity
  and mortality.'
