input_text: 'A systematic review comparing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant
  to gene therapy in sickle cell disease. INTRODUCTION: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem
  cell transplant (HSCT) and gene therapy (GT) are two potentially curative approaches
  for sickle cell disease (SCD), but they have never been compared in clinical trials.
  OBJECTIVE: To compare the safety and efficacy of HSCT and GT to assist clinicians
  and patients in making informed treatment decisions. METHODS: Phase I-III clinical
  trials and case reports/series were included. Regimens included HSCT from all stem
  cell sources, lentiviral gene therapy, and gene editing, with any conditioning regimen.
  We searched Medline and EMBASE databases as of 1st June 2020 for studies reporting
  HSCT and GT outcomes in SCD. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to assess the risk
  of bias. Descriptive statistics and post-hoc imputation for standard deviations
  of mean change in FEV1 and FVC were performed. RESULTS: In total, 56 studies (HSCT,
  n = 53; GT, n = 3) representing 1,198 patients met inclusion criteria (HSCT, n =
  1,158; GT, n = 40). Length of follow-up was 3,881.5 and 58.7 patient-years for HSCT
  and GT, respectively. Overall quality of evidence was low, with no randomized controlled
  trials identified. Two-year overall survival for HSCT was 91%; mortality was 2.5%
  for GT. Acute chest syndrome and vaso-occlusive episodes were reduced post-HSCT
  and GT. Meta-analysis was not possible due to lack of comparator and heterogeneity
  in outcome measures reporting. Very few studies reported post-transplant end-organ
  function. Six secondary malignancies (5 post-HSCT, 1 post-GT) were reported. DISCUSSION:
  Reporting of SCD-related complications and patient-important outcomes is lacking
  for both strategies. We advocate for standardized reporting to better compare outcomes
  within and between treatment groups.'
