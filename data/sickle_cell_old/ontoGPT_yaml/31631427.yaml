input_text: 'Challenges in providing compatible blood with Rh genotype-matching in
  Brazilian patients with sickle cell disease. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was
  to verify the possibility of performing prophylactic Rh genotype-matching in Brazilian
  patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and identify the genotypes that are lacking
  or insufficient in our donor cohort. BACKGROUND: Rh alloimmunisation is still a
  challenge in transfused patients with SCD. Rh genotype-matching may mitigate Rh
  alloimmunisation. METHODS/MATERIALS: We examined the transfusion requests for antigen-matched
  donor units in SCD patients with Rh variants and compared the Rh altered alleles
  in the patients to the Rh allele frequency in a selected donor population. For each
  patient and donor, RBC antigen genotyping was performed using HEA, RHD and RHCE
  BeadChip arrays. Sequencing was used to clarify inconclusive results. Twenty-one
  patients and 956 Brazilian blood donors were genotyped. RESULTS: According to our
  matching strategies, 47 6% of patients filled most of their unit requests, but 52
  4% of patients had insufficient donors to fill their annual transfusion needs. We
  found different combinations of RHCE variant alleles in patients and donors, but
  the most frequent genotypes that are lacking or insufficient in our donor cohort
  are those associated with the lack of hrB and hrS high prevalence antigens and those
  co-inherited with altered RHD alleles. CONCLUSION: Our study shows that the provision
  of compatible blood with Rh genotype-matching in Brazilian patients with SCD can
  be feasible but challenging and, efficient strategies of recruitment of African-Brazilian
  donors must be developed.'
