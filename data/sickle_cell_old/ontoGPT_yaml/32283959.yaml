input_text: 'Veno-Venous Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation in Adult Patients with
  Sickle Cell Disease and Acute Chest Syndrome: a Single-Center Experience. Acute
  chest syndrome (ACS) in adult patients with sickle cell disease represents a leading
  cause of death. It is characterized by a new density on chest X-ray accompanied
  by fever and/or respiratory symptoms. Currently, 49 adult patients with sickle cell
  disease are registered at our department. By now, 12 patients (24.5%) suffered from
  ACS and two patients showed multiple/recurrent (>2) episodes. Death in one patient
  was related to acute respiratory failure secondary to ACS. In three patients with
  ACS, invasive mechanical ventilation and subsequent veno-venous extracorporeal membrane
  oxygenation (VV-ECMO) was mandatory. Veno-venous ECMO was applied within 24 hours
  upon arrival to the intensive care unit (ICU). All patients were treated aggressively
  for ACS including exchange transfusions [packed red blood cell (pRBC) units 5-16]
  maintaining a Hb S threshold of <30.0% in addition to broad-spectrum antibiotics,
  resulting in a successful outcome following decannulation from VV-ECMO (49 hours,
  251 hours, 30 min., and 98 hours, respectively). Limited information is presently
  available on the use of VV-ECMO in adult patients with sickle cell disease in the
  context of acute respiratory failure secondary to ACS. The adequate timing of the
  decision to place ECMO in critically ill adults with sickle cell disease, incapable
  of being treated by conventional mechanical ventilation secondary to very severe
  vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC), might further reduce mortality rates while treating
  the underlying condition.'
