input_text: Current and Future Therapeutics for Treating Patients with Sickle Cell
  Disease. Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common genetic blood disorder in
  the United States, with over 100,000 people suffering from this debilitating disease.
  SCD is caused by abnormal hemoglobin (Hb) variants that interfere with normal red
  blood cell (RBC) function. Research on SCD has led to the development and approval
  of several new SCD therapies in recent years. The recent FDA-approved novel gene
  therapies are potentially curative, giving patients an additional option besides
  a hematopoietic bone marrow transplant. Despite the promise of existing therapies,
  questions remain regarding their long-term pharmacological effects on adults and
  children. These questions, along with the exorbitant cost of the new gene therapies,
  justify additional research into more effective therapeutic options. Continual research
  in this field focuses on not only developing cheaper, more effective cures/treatments
  but also investigating the physiological effects of the current therapies on SCD
  patients, particularly on the brain and kidneys. In this article, we undertake a
  comprehensive review of ongoing clinical trials with completion dates in 2024 or
  later. Our exploration provides insights into the landscape of current therapeutics
  and emerging novel therapies designed to combat and potentially eradicate SCD, including
  the latest FDA-approved gene therapies.
