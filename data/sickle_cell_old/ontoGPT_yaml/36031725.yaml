input_text: "Neurocognitive functioning in children with sickle cell anemia and history
  of abnormal transcranial doppler ultrasonography. BACKGROUND: Transcranial doppler
  (TCD) ultrasonography can be used to identify stroke risk in children with sickle
  cell anemia. Previous studies have reported mixed findings on neurocognitive outcomes
  in children with elevated TCD. This study examined associations between TCD velocity
  and neurocognitive outcomes in children and adolescents without prior history of
  stroke. PROCEDURE: Participants were selected from the Sickle Cell Clinical Research
  Intervention Program cohort. The highest recorded mean maximum TCD velocity was
  selected for analysis, along with participant's most recent data from serial neurocognitive
  surveillance. RESULTS: A total of 200 children with sickle cell anemia completed
  neurocognitive testing (109 males, 91 females; mean age 12.7 years [SD = 3.56]).
  Most participants were prescribed hydroxyurea (72%) at the time of neurocognitive
  testing and nearly 16% had a history of chronic transfusions prior to neurocognitive
  evaluation. Mean age at time of highest TCD value was 6.6 years (SD = 2.5) and 13.5%
  of screenings were abnormal (>=200 cm/s). Mean interval between TCD and most recent
  neurocognitive evaluation was 6.1 years (+-3.5). There were no significant differences
  in the interval between TCD and neurocognitive testing across normal, conditional,
  and abnormal groups. Maximum TCD velocity was not significantly associated with
  neurocognitive outcomes in multivariate models. CONCLUSIONS: History of elevated
  TCD in the absence of overt stroke should not be considered a risk factor for poor
  neurocognitive outcomes in children and adolescents with sickle cell anemia on modern
  disease-modifying therapy."
