input_text: "Low rates of transfusion-transmitted infection screening in chronically
  transfused adults with sickle cell disease. BACKGROUND: Adults with sickle cell
  disease (SCD) on chronic transfusion therapy are exposed to a large volume of blood
  products, thus increasing their risk of transfusion-associated human immunodeficiency
  virus (HIV), hepatitis C (HCV), and hepatitis B (HBV). METHODS: We performed a systematic
  chart review of chronically transfused SCD subjects at the Johns Hopkins Sickle
  Cell Center for Adults between October 2014 and September 2019 to determine our
  Center's adherence to the 2014 National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI)
  SCD guidelines for annual screening for Transfusion Transmitted infections (TTI)
  and assessed HBV immunity and HBV vaccination rates. RESULTS: The study included
  85 subjects with a median age of 34 years (23-63); 52% were female. No subject received
  annual screening; 68 subjects (80%) were screened for HIV, 60 subjects (71%) for
  HCV and 53 subjects (62%) for HBV infections at least once in the study period.
  Of those screened, one patient was newly diagnosed with HCV infection, and none
  with HIV or HBV infection. Among 31 subjects tested for anti-Hepatitis B surface
  antibody, 16 subjects (52%) tested negative. Nineteen (20%) subjects had HBV vaccination
  documented. CONCLUSIONS: Low adherence to the NHLBI TTI screening guidelines, especially
  for HBV, highlights the resource intensiveness of this patient population. The low
  rates of anti-Hepatitis B surface antibody positivity highlight the need to confirm
  vaccination, provide boosters as indicated, and investigate the adults with SCD's
  immune response to HBV vaccination."
