input_text: Optimizing the management of chronic pain in sickle cell disease. Chronic
  pain in sickle cell disease (SCD) refers to pain present on most days lasting over
  six months. It can start during childhood and the prevalence increases with age.
  By adulthood, over 55% of patients experience pain on over 50% of days; 29% reporting
  pain on 95% of days. The true prevalence of chronic pain in SCD is likely underappreciated
  as it is mostly managed at home. Patients with chronic pain and SCD frequently seek
  acute care for exacerbation of underlying chronic pain difficult to distinguish
  from their usual acute vaso-occlusive crises. When treating chronic pain in SCD,
  the challenge is distinguishing between non-SCD related etiologies versus chronic
  pain resulting from SCD pathophysiological processes. This distinction is important
  to delineate as it will drive appropriate management strategies. Chronic pain in
  SCD has profound consequences for the patient; is often associated with comorbid
  psychiatric illnesses (depression and anxiety), not dissimilar from other chronic
  pain syndromes. They may also experience challenges with sleep hygiene, various
  somatic symptoms, and chronic fatigue that impair quality of life. How best to treat
  chronic pain in SCD is not definitively established. Both acute and chronic pain
  in SCD is typically treated with opioids. Emerging data suggests that chronic opioid
  therapy (COT) is a suboptimal treatment strategy for chronic pain. This review will
  discuss the complexity of managing chronic pain in SCD; pain that may be dependent
  or independent of the underlying SCD diagnosis. We will also describe alternative
  treatment approaches to high-dose COT.
