input_text: "Trends in Technology Assistance Among Patients With Childhood Onset Chronic
  Conditions. OBJECTIVE: To describe the prevalence, types, and trends over time of
  medical technology assistance (TA) in patients at the age of transition to adult
  care with childhood onset chronic conditions (COCCs) cared for at children's hospitals.
  PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this retrospective repeated annual cross-sectional cohort
  study of the Pediatric Health Information Systems inpatient data, patients with
  at least 1 hospitalization from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2018 with a selected
  COCC were included. The COCCs investigated were brain and spinal cord malformation,
  cerebral palsy, heart and great vessel malformation, cystic fibrosis, sickle cell
  anemia, and chronic renal failure. TA was defined as requiring an indwelling medical
  device to maintain health status. Trends over time in TA were analyzed with the
  Cochran-Armitage test and generalized linear models. RESULTS: During the study,
  381 289 unique patients accounted for 940 816 hospitalizations. Transition-aged
  patients (19-21 years old) represented 2.4% of all included hospitalizations over
  the 11-year period, whereas patients ages 21 and above represented 2.7%. The annual
  proportion of patients with TA increased significantly from 31.3% in 2008 to 36.9%
  in 2018, a 17.9% increase (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of patients with
  select COCCs hospitalized at children's hospitals, a substantial and growing number
  of patients at the age of transition to adult care required TA. Identifying adult
  providers with resources to manage COCCs and maintain medical devices placed in
  childhood is challenging. These trends warrant special attention to support the
  timely and successful transition of medically complex patients from pediatric to
  adult care."
