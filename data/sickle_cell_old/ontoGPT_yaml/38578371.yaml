input_text: 'Partial Splenic Embolization in Paediatric Sickle Cell Disease Patients
  with Hypersplenism. PURPOSE: To assess the safety and efficacy of partial splenic
  embolization (PSE) to reduce the need of transfusions and improve hematologic parameters
  in patients with hypersplenism and sickle cell disease (SCD). MATERIAL AND METHODS:
  This prospective study includes 35 homozygous hemoglobin S patients with SCD and
  hypersplenism who underwent PSE from 2015 until 2021 in Kinshasa. Patients were
  evaluated, before and after PSE (1, 3 and 6 months), using clinical, laboratory
  and ultrasonographic methods. PSE was performed with the administration of gelatin
  sponge particles embolizing 60-70% of the splenic parenchyma. RESULTS: The mean
  age was 10 (+- 4) years and (21/35, 60%) were male. After PSE Leucocytes decreased
  at 3 months (16 692.94 vs 13 582.86, p = 0.02) and at six months Erythrocytes increased
  2 004 000 vs. 2 804 142 (p < 0.001), Platelets increased (168 147 vs. 308 445, p
  < 0.001) and Hemoglobin increased (5.05 g/dL vs. 6.31 g/dL, p < 0.001) There was
  a significant dicrease in the need of transfusions from 6 (2-20) before PSE to 0.06
  (0-1) after PSE (p < 0.001). The most frequent complication was splenic rupture
  (4/35, 11.4%), seen only and in all patients with hypoechogenic nodules at baseline.
  CONCLUSION: PSE is a safe procedure in patients with SCD and hypersplenism, that
  do not have hypoechogenic nodules in the spleen. PSE improves the hematological
  parameters and reduces the frequency of blood transfusions.'
