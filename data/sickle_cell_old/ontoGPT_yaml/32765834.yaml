input_text: Drug Therapies for the Management of Sickle Cell Disease. Sickle cell
  disease (SCD) afflicts millions of people worldwide but is referred to as an orphan
  disease in the United States. Over the past several decades, there has been an increasing
  understanding of the pathophysiology of SCD and its complications. While most individuals
  with SCD in resource-rich countries survive into adulthood, the life expectancy
  of patients with SCD remains substantially shorter than for the general African-American
  population. SCD can be cured using hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and possibly
  gene therapy, but these treatment approaches are not available to most patients,
  the majority of whom reside in low- and middle-income countries. Until relatively
  recently, only one drug, hydroxyurea, was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration
  to ameliorate disease severity. Multiple other drugs (L-glutamine, crizanlizumab,
  and voxelotor) have recently been approved for the treatment of SCD, with several
  others at various stages of clinical testing. The availability of multiple agents
  to treat SCD raises questions related to the choice of appropriate drug therapy,
  combination of multiple agents, and affordability of recently approved products.
  The enthusiasm for new drug development provides opportunities to involve patients
  in low- and middle-income nations in the testing of potentially disease-modifying
  therapies and has the potential to contribute to capacity building in these environments.
  Demonstration that these agents, alone or in combination, can prevent or decrease
  end-organ damage would provide additional evidence for the role of drug therapies
  in improving outcomes in SCD.
