input_text: "Expert consensus on the management of infusion-related reactions (IRRs)
  in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) receiving crizanlizumab: a RAND/UCLA
  modified Delphi panel. Crizanlizumab, a monoclonal antibody against P-selectin,
  has been shown to reduce vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs) compared to placebo in patients
  >= 16 years with sickle cell disease (SCD). However, there have been rare reports
  of patients experiencing severe pain and subsequent complications within 24 hours
  of crizanlizumab infusions. These events are defined as infusion-related reactions
  (IRRs). Informed by current literature and clinical experience, a group of content
  experts developed clinical guidelines for the management of IRRs in patients with
  SCD. We used the RAND/University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) modified Delphi
  panel method, a valid, reproducible technique for achieving consensus. We present
  our recommendations for managing IRRs, which depend on patient characteristics including:
  prior history of IRRs to other monoclonal antibodies or medications, changes to
  crizanlizumab infusion rate and patient monitoring, pain severity relative to patient's
  typical SCD crises, and severe allergic symptoms. These recommendations outline
  how to evaluate and manage IRRs in patients receiving crizanlizumab. Future research
  should validate this guidance using clinical data and identify patients at risk
  for these IRRs."
