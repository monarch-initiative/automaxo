input_text: "An Updated Equitable Model of Readiness for Transition to Adult Care:
  Content Validation in Young People With Sickle Cell Disease. Importance: Despite
  elevated health risks during young adulthood, many adolescents and young adults
  with serious health care needs face barriers during the transfer to an adult specialty
  practitioner, and health disparities may occur during the transition. Objective:
  To validate the content of an updated Social-Ecological Model of Adolescent and
  Young Adult Readiness for Transition to Promote Health Equity (SMART-E) in a group
  of adolescents and young adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) and their supports.
  Design, Setting, and Participants: Health equity framework components were reviewed.
  Systems of power (eg, institutional and practitioner bias) and environments or networks
  (eg, peer or school support) were added as SMART-E preexisting factors, and health
  literacy was included within readiness factors. Adolescents and young adults aged
  16 to 29 years with SCD, caregivers, and practitioners participated in this convergent,
  mixed-methods study within Children's Hospital of Philadelphia between January and
  August 2022. Main Outcomes and Measures: Content validity was assessed through nominations
  of top 3 most important transition barriers prior to interviews and focus groups,
  ratings on importance of SMART-E factors (0-4 scale; ratings >2 support validity)
  after interviews and focus groups, nominations of 3 most important factors for transition
  and for health equity, and qualitative content analysis of interview transcripts.
  Results: The study enrolled 10 pediatric adolescents and young adults (mean [SD]
  age, 18.6 [2.9] years; 4 female and 6 male), 10 transferred adolescents and young
  adults (mean [SD] age, 22.9 [2.1] years; 8 female and 2 male), 9 caregivers (mean
  [SD] age, 49.8 [8.7] years; 5 female and 4 male), and 9 practitioners (mean [SD]
  age, 45.6 [10.5] years; 8 female and 1 male). Quantitative ratings supported the
  content validity of SMART-E and met established criteria for validity. Systems of
  power was the most endorsed transition barrier (14 of 38 participants) reported
  prior to interviews and focus groups. After the interview, participants endorsed
  all SMART-E factors as important for transition, with new factors systems of power
  and environments and networks rated at a mean (SD) 2.8 (1.23) and 3.1 (0.90), respectively,
  on a 0 to 4 scale of importance. The most important factors for transition and equity
  varied by participant group, with all factors being endorsed, supporting the comprehensiveness
  of SMART-E. Qualitative data corroborated quantitative findings, further supporting
  validity, and minor modifications were made to definitions. Conclusions and Relevance:
  SMART-E obtained initial content validation with inclusion of health equity factors
  for adolescents and young adults with SCD, caregivers, and practitioners. The model
  should be evaluated in other populations of adolescents and young adults with chronic
  disease."
