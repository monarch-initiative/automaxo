input_text: 'Acute and chronic pain management in patients with sickle cell disease
  in the modern era: a comprehensive review. Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most
  common inherited red blood cell (RBC) disorder worldwide, resulting in chronic hemolytic
  anemia, vaso-occlusion, tissue hypoxia, and ultimately end organ damage. The hallmark
  of the disease is manifested by vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) resulting in acute on
  chronic pain, and the most common cause for presentation to the emergency department
  and hospital admission. The management of pain for patients with SCD in the U.S.
  has historically been socially and politically complex with most patients experiencing
  pain on a daily basis but not seeking immediate medical attention. The pathophysiology
  of acute and chronic pain in SCD is multifactorial and complex. Here, we describe
  factors contributing to acute and chronic pain in SCD and management strategies.'
