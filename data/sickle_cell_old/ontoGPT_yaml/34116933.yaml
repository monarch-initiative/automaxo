input_text: "Taking therapeutic apheresis services to patients in South Africa: An
  eight year review of SANBS mobile therapeutic apheresis service, 2013-2020. INTRODUCTION:
  A 20 year review of health and health care presents the multiple challenges faced
  by South Africans. Health and poverty is highlighted with 45% of population living
  on approximately US$ 2 per day and 10 million living on less than US$ 1 per day.
  Widening disparities in health care provision between public and private sector
  hospital services exist. The South African population includes the largest number
  of people living with HIV infection/AIDS of any country in the world, with a 70%
  estimate of 7.5 million people living with HIV on antiretroviral therapy. The South
  African National Blood Service provides a mixed model therapeutic apheresis service
  including mobile service and fixed-site therapeutic apheresis and an apheresis collection
  of hematopoietic stem cell (HPC-A) service. Therapeutic apheresis modalities offered
  by SANBS include plasmapheresis, red cell exchange, leukocyte and platelet reduction.
  In addition, collection of plasma, thrombocytes, mononuclear cells including CD34+
  cells (HPCs) and granulocytes by apheresis for plasma and cellular therapies, and
  customised apheresis products for research purposes is offered. An operational database
  for the period 2013 to 2020 was reviewed to characterise the SANBS's mixed therapeutic
  apheresis service and HPC-A service from 2013 to 2020 in terms of patient numbers,
  patient demographics, patient procedures, therapeutic apheresis indication or diagnosis,
  therapeutic apheresis modality, hospital service type, and the American Society
  for Apheresis (ASFA) category of diagnosis. METHODS: A retrospective review of therapeutic
  apheresis patients referred to SANBS characterising patient numbers, patient demographics,
  patient procedures, therapeutic apheresis indication or diagnosis, therapeutic apheresis
  modality (Linz, 2017), hospital service type, and the ASFA category of diagnosis
  (Padmanabhan et al., 2019) for the period 01 January 2013 to 31 December 2020 was
  completed. Data is obtained from a SANBS operational routinely utilised to record
  patient procedure data. Patient procedure data is manually recorded by apheresis
  nurses and indexed on to the operational database, with both processes audited.
  The review period is a convenience sample. Storage of the database and access of
  the operational database is in compliance with the Protection of Personal Information
  Act (Government Gazette, 2013). Therapeutic apheresis modalities analysed include
  Plasmapheresis, Red Cell Exchange, Leukopheresis, Thrombocytapheresis, Lymphocyte
  collection, Granulocyte collection, Haematopoietic stem cell collection by apheresis
  and customised apheresis products for research purposes. Customised apheresis products
  for research purposes is excluded from this review. Descriptive statistics is used.
  RESULTS: For the review period, 2,485 unique patients with 120 unique indications
  as recorded by referring clinicians received 13,518 procedures involving 7 therapeutic
  apheresis modalities at 78 hospitals (21 public sector and 57 private sector) and
  at 3 SANBS blood donor centres in 7 provinces of South Africa. The age range of
  patients serviced is 4 months to 90 years (median = 39.5 years) (figure 1), 91%
  by procedure count was for patients 21 years of age or older, 62% were female, with
  10,783 (79.6%) procedures performed in public sector hospitals. In all patients,
  the most common indications was plasmapheresis for thrombotic thromobocytopaenic
  purpura (52.5% of cumulative procedures), HPC-A for multiple myeloma (7.86%) and
  Antibody-mediated kidney transplant rejection (4.90%). Plasmapheresis was the most
  common therapeutic apheresis modality used (82.5% of cumulative procedures) followed
  by HPC-A (13.7%) and leukoreduction (3.39%). A range of indications for plasmapheresis
  (n = 65) and HPC-A (n = 41) were observed. Red cell exchange procedures was performed
  for patients with severe malaria and sickle cell disease indications. For leukoreduction
  indications, all patients were adults managed in public sector facilities and all
  were symptomatic. The most common indications were Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia,
  Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia and Multiple Myeloma. A pooled, total white cell count
  average of 457 x 109/L (range 141-689 x 109/L) prior to first procedure. Despite
  complex challenges for a national mixed model service, successful patient outcomes
  in emergent indications such as TTP (Louw et al., 2018; Swart et al., 2019) and
  engraftment post HPC-A in HSCT in multiple centres (Glatt, personal communication)
  are reported. CONCLUSION: The review confirms that apheresis medicine is increasingly
  used in South Africa in patients in both public and private sector, with the most
  common modalities being plasmapheresis, HPC-A and leukoreduction. Patients with
  HIV-associated TTP is the most commonly referred patient in both paediatric and
  adult patients and this is anticipated to continue. A growing HSCT transplant network
  capacity in South Africa is augmented through the mixed model mobile and fixed-site
  therapeutic apheresis services, including a mobile HPC-A service. The increasing
  number of HPC-A is a trend towards increasing numbers of patients support to HSCT
  for both adults and paediatric patients in private and public sector hospitals."
