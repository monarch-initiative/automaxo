input_text: Mixed donor chimerism following stem cell transplantation for sickle cell
  disease. Sickle cell disease is a debilitating hemoglobinopathy with high morbidity
  and mortality. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) is curative, but the
  presence of mixed donor/recipient chimerism post-HCT raises concerns about disease
  control long-term. Mixed donor/recipient chimerism is reported in significant numbers
  even after aggressive HCT conditioning regimens. Post-HCT, adequacy of donor erythropoiesis
  is crucial for disease control. This review explores the relationship between mixed
  donor/recipient chimerism and outcomes post-HCT. Serial chimerism analysis in lineage
  specific manner in erythroid or myeloid cells post-HCT predicts for disease control
  and HCT success. Adequate and stable donor-derived erythropoiesis is essential for
  reversing SCD manifestations. Myeloid lineage chimerism mirrors erythropoiesis is
  commercially available, and a reliable indicator of adequacy. Using this tool, the
  minimum threshold of donor chimerism is required to prevent SCD-related complications
  and maintain sickle hemoglobin less than 50% is approximately 20-25% even when a
  donor has Hb S trait. Curative interventions should, at a minimum, meet this goal
  long-term. Achieving a balance between successful engraftment while minimizing toxicity
  is important in patients vulnerable because of age or preexisting morbidity and
  is the objective of recent clinical trials. As HCT and gene therapies evolve, efficient
  long-term follow-up that includes durability assessment of mixed donor/recipient
  chimerism will be crucial.
