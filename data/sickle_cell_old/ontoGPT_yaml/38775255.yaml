input_text: "Antioxidant supplementation for sickle cell disease. BACKGROUND: Sickle
  cell disease (SCD) refers to a group of genetic disorders characterized by the presence
  of an abnormal haemoglobin molecule called haemoglobin S (HbS). When subjected to
  oxidative stress from low oxygen concentrations, HbS molecules form rigid polymers,
  giving the red cell the typical sickle shape. Antioxidants have been shown to reduce
  oxidative stress and improve outcomes in other diseases associated with oxidative
  stress. Therefore, it is important to review and synthesize the available evidence
  on the effect of antioxidants on the clinical outcomes of people with SCD. OBJECTIVES:
  To assess the effectiveness and safety of antioxidant supplementation for improving
  health outcomes in people with SCD. SEARCH METHODS: We used standard, extensive
  Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 15 August 2023. SELECTION CRITERIA:
  We included randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing antioxidant
  supplementation to placebo, other antioxidants, or different doses of antioxidants,
  in people with SCD. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently extracted
  data, assessed the risk of bias and certainty of the evidence, and reported according
  to Cochrane methodological procedures. MAIN RESULTS: The review included 1609 participants
  in 26 studies, with 17 comparisons. We rated 13 studies as having a high risk of
  bias overall, and 13 studies as having an unclear risk of bias overall due to study
  limitations. We used GRADE to rate the certainty of evidence. Only eight studies
  reported on our important outcomes at six months. Vitamin C (1400 mg) plus vitamin
  E (800 mg) versus placebo Based on evidence from one study in 83 participants, vitamin
  C (1400 mg) plus vitamin E (800 mg) may not be better than placebo at reducing the
  frequency of crisis (risk ratio (RR) 1.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64 to
  2.18), the severity of pain (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.40 to 4.37), or adverse effects (AE),
  of which the most common were headache, nausea, fatigue, diarrhoea, and epigastric
  pain (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.00). Vitamin C plus vitamin E may increase the risk
  of SCD-related complications (acute chest syndrome: RR 2.66, 95% CI 0.77 to 9.13;
  1 study, 83 participants), and increase haemoglobin level (median (interquartile
  range) 90 (81 to 96) g/L versus 93.5 (84 to 105) g/L) (1 study, 83 participants)
  compared to placebo. However, the evidence for all the above effects is very uncertain.
  The study did not report on quality of life (QoL) of participants and their caregivers,
  nor on frequency of hospitalization. Zinc versus placebo Zinc may not be better
  than placebo at reducing the frequency of crisis at six months (rate ratio 0.62,
  95% CI 0.17 to 2.29; 1 study, 36 participants; low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain
  whether zinc is better than placebo at improving sickle cell-related complications
  (complete healing of leg ulcers at six months: RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.60 to 6.72; 1 study,
  34 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Zinc may be better than placebo at
  increasing haemoglobin level (g/dL) (MD 1.26, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.26; 1 study, 36 participants;
  low-certainty evidence). The study did not report on severity of pain, QoL, AE,
  and frequency of hospitalization. N-acetylcysteine versus placebo N-acetylcysteine
  (NAC) 1200 mg may not be better than placebo at reducing the frequency of crisis
  in SCD, reported as pain days (rate ratio 0.99 days, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.84; 1 study,
  96 participants; low-certainty evidence). Low-certainty evidence from one study
  (96 participants) suggests NAC (1200 mg) may not be better than placebo at reducing
  the severity of pain (MD 0.17, 95% CI -0.53 to 0.87). Compared to placebo, NAC (1200
  mg) may not be better at improving physical QoL (MD -1.80, 95% CI -5.01 to 1.41)
  and mental QoL (MD 2.00, 95% CI -1.45 to 5.45; very low-certainty evidence), reducing
  the risk of adverse effects (gastrointestinal complaints, pruritus, or rash) (RR
  0.92, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.14; low-certainty evidence), reducing the frequency of hospitalizations
  (rate ratio 0.98, 95% CI 0.41 to 2.38; low-certainty evidence), and sickle cell-related
  complications (RR 5.00, 95% CI 0.25 to 101.48; very low-certainty evidence), or
  increasing haemoglobin level (MD -0.18 g/dL, 95% CI -0.40 to 0.04; low-certainty
  evidence). L-arginine versus placebo L-arginine may not be better than placebo at
  reducing the frequency of crisis (monthly pain) (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.95; 1
  study, 50 participants; low-certainty evidence). However, L-arginine may be better
  than placebo at reducing the severity of pain (MD -1.41, 95% CI -1.65 to -1.18;
  2 studies, 125 participants; low-certainty evidence). One participant allocated
  to L-arginine developed hives during infusion of L-arginine, another experienced
  acute clinical deterioration, and a participant in the placebo group had clinically
  relevant increases in liver function enzymes. The evidence is very uncertain whether
  L-arginine is better at reducing the mean number of days in hospital compared to
  placebo (MD -0.85 days, 95% CI -1.87 to 0.17; 2 studies, 125 participants; very
  low-certainty evidence). Also, L-arginine may not be better than placebo at increasing
  haemoglobin level (MD 0.4 g/dL, 95% CI -0.50 to 1.3; 2 studies, 106 participants;
  low-certainty evidence). No study in this comparison reported on QoL and sickle
  cell-related complications. Omega-3 versus placebo Very low-certainty evidence shows
  no evidence of a difference in the risk of adverse effects of omega-3 compared to
  placebo (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.48; 1 study, 67 participants). Very low-certainty
  evidence suggests that omega-3 may not be better than placebo at increasing haemoglobin
  level (MD 0.36 g/L, 95% CI -0.21 to 0.93; 1 study, 67 participants). The study did
  not report on frequency of crisis, severity of pain, QoL, frequency of hospitalization,
  and sickle cell-related complications. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There was inconsistent
  evidence on all outcomes to draw conclusions on the beneficial and harmful effects
  of antioxidants. However, L-arginine may be better than placebo at reducing the
  severity of pain at six months, and zinc may be better than placebo at increasing
  haemoglobin level. We are uncertain whether other antioxidants are beneficial for
  SCD. Larger studies conducted on each comparison would reduce the current uncertainties."
