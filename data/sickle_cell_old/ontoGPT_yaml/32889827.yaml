input_text: "Role of complement in alloimmunization and hyperhemolysis. PURPOSE OF
  REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to summarize the role of complement in regulating
  the removal of a target alloantigen following an incompatible red blood cell (RBC)
  transfusion, the formation of alloantibodies following RBC alloantigen exposure,
  and the development of hyperhemolysis in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD).
  RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies demonstrate that complement can accelerate alloantibody-mediated
  removal of target alloantigens from the RBC surface following incompatible transfusion.
  Complement also influences alloantigen availability during developing alloimmune
  responses and serves as a unique mediator of CD4 T-cell-independent alloantibody
  formation following RBC alloantigen exposure. Finally, alternative complement pathway
  activation appears to play a key role in the development of acute hemolytic episodes
  in patients with SCD, providing a potential druggable target to prevent acute complications
  in patients with this disease. SUMMARY: Recent studies suggest that complement can
  regulate a wide variety of processes germane to hematology, from transfusion complications
  to baseline hemolysis in patients with SCD. As the role of complement in various
  disease processes becomes more fully understood, the ability to leverage recently
  developed complement modulating drugs will only continue to enhance providers' ability
  to favorably intervene in many hematological diseases."
