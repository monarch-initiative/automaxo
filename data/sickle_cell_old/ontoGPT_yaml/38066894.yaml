input_text: 'The range of haploidentical transplant protocols in sickle cell disease:
  all haplos are not created equally. The ideal curative therapy for sickle cell disease
  (SCD) must be applicable across all ages and include individuals with strokes and
  preexisting heart, lung, and kidney disease. Myeloablative, matched sibling donor
  hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) for children with SCD has shown excellent
  outcomes over the past 3 decades but has been restricted due to the limited availability
  of a human leukocyte antigen-matched sibling donor (10%-15%) and increased treatment-related
  death in adults with myeloablative conditioning. To overcome these 2 significant
  barriers to curative therapy in SCD, related haploidentical HCT has become an active
  area of research. The use of related haploidentical donors (first- and second-degree
  relatives) increases the donor pool to at least 90% of those eligible across the
  life span. Importantly, most adults, even with strokes or significant comorbidities,
  can tolerate the nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen without treatment-related
  death. Since 2013, at least 3 related haploidentical HCT strategies have emerged
  as potential curative therapies for SCD: (1) a nonmyeloablative, T-cell replete,
  bone marrow transplant with thiotepa and posttransplant cyclophosphamide with a
  goal of complete donor chimerism; (2) a nonmyeloablative, in vivo T-cell depletion,
  using peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) with a goal of stable mixed donor-recipient
  chimerism; and (3) a myeloablative, ex vivo T-cell depletion using PBSCs and advanced-technology
  graft manipulation, with a goal of complete donor chimerism. We review the similarities,
  differences, outcomes, and gaps in knowledge with these 3 haploidentical HCT approaches
  for SCD.'
