input_text: 'Exagamglogene Autotemcel for Severe Sickle Cell Disease. BACKGROUND:
  Exagamglogene autotemcel (exa-cel) is a nonviral cell therapy designed to reactivate
  fetal hemoglobin synthesis by means of ex vivo clustered regularly interspaced short
  palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 gene editing of autologous CD34+ hematopoietic
  stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) at the erythroid-specific enhancer region of BCL11A.
  METHODS: We conducted a phase 3, single-group, open-label study of exa-cel in patients
  12 to 35 years of age with sickle cell disease who had had at least two severe vaso-occlusive
  crises in each of the 2 years before screening. CD34+ HSPCs were edited with the
  use of CRISPR-Cas9. Before the exa-cel infusion, patients underwent myeloablative
  conditioning with pharmacokinetically dose-adjusted busulfan. The primary end point
  was freedom from severe vaso-occlusive crises for at least 12 consecutive months.
  A key secondary end point was freedom from inpatient hospitalization for severe
  vaso-occlusive crises for at least 12 consecutive months. The safety of exa-cel
  was also assessed. RESULTS: A total of 44 patients received exa-cel, and the median
  follow-up was 19.3 months (range, 0.8 to 48.1). Neutrophils and platelets engrafted
  in each patient. Of the 30 patients who had sufficient follow-up to be evaluated,
  29 (97%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 83 to 100) were free from vaso-occlusive
  crises for at least 12 consecutive months, and all 30 (100%; 95% CI, 88 to 100)
  were free from hospitalizations for vaso-occlusive crises for at least 12 consecutive
  months (P<0.001 for both comparisons against the null hypothesis of a 50% response).
  The safety profile of exa-cel was generally consistent with that of myeloablative
  busulfan conditioning and autologous HSPC transplantation. No cancers occurred.
  CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with exa-cel eliminated vaso-occlusive crises in 97% of patients
  with sickle cell disease for a period of 12 months or more. (CLIMB SCD-121; ClinicalTrials.gov
  number, NCT03745287.).'
