input_text: 'Economic evaluation of regular transfusions for cerebral infarct recurrence
  in the Silent Cerebral Infarct Transfusion Trial. In 2020, the American Society
  of Hematology published evidence-based guidelines for cerebrovascular disease in
  individuals with sickle cell anemia (SCA). Although the guidelines were based on
  National Institutes of Health-sponsored randomized controlled trials, no cost-effectiveness
  analysis was completed for children with SCA and silent cerebral infarcts. We conducted
  a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing regular blood transfusion vs standard care
  using SIT (Silent Cerebral Infarct Transfusion) Trial participants. This analysis
  included a modified societal perspective with direct costs (hospitalization, emergency
  department visit, transfusion, outpatient care, and iron chelation) and indirect
  costs (special education). Direct medical costs were estimated from hospitalizations
  from SIT hospitals and unlinked aggregated hospital and outpatient costs from SIT
  sites by using the Pediatric Health Information System. Indirect costs were estimated
  from published literature. Effectiveness was prevention of infarct recurrence. An
  incremental cost-effectiveness ratio using a 3-year time horizon (mean SIT Trial
  participant follow-up) compared transfusion vs standard care. A total of 196 participants
  received transfusions (n = 90) or standard care (n = 106), with a mean age of 10.0
  years. Annual hospitalization costs were reduced by 54% for transfusions vs standard
  care ($4929 vs $10 802), but transfusion group outpatient costs added $22 454 to
  $137 022 per year. Special education cost savings were $2634 over 3 years for every
  infarct prevented. Transfusion therapy had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio
  of $22 025 per infarct prevented. Children with preexisting silent cerebral infarcts
  receiving blood transfusions had lower hospitalization costs but higher outpatient
  costs, primarily associated with the oral iron chelator deferasirox. Regular blood
  transfusion therapy is cost-effective for infarct recurrence in children with SCA.
  This trial is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00072761.'
