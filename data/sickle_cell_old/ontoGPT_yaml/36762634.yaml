input_text: "Stroke in the young. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is
  to review recent findings regarding stroke epidemiology, etiologies, and treatment
  in children and young adults. RECENT FINDINGS: Incidence in young adults is increasing,
  and incidence, recurrence, and survival is worse in patients with cryptogenic stroke
  and in developing countries. Careful consideration of patent foramen ovale closure
  is now recommended in young adults with cryptogenic stroke. Thrombectomy has recently
  been extended to carefully selected children with acute ischemic stroke, and two
  recent publications strongly suggest that it can be beneficial for children. Sickle
  cell is also an important global contributor to stroke burden, but hydroxyurea can
  be a cost effective medication for stroke prevention in children. Recent advances
  in genetic testing and treatments may improve outcomes for patients with monogenic
  causes of stroke, such as deficiency of adenosine deaminase 2, hemophilia, and Fabry's
  disease. SUMMARY: Stroke in children and young adults is a morbid disease responsible
  for enormous indirect societal costs and a high burden of years with disability
  per affected patient. Recent advances have improved access to care for children
  with large vessel occlusion and adults with rare causes of stroke. Future research
  may bring effective treatments for other monogenic causes of stroke as well as increasing
  access to hyperacute therapies for young stroke patients."
