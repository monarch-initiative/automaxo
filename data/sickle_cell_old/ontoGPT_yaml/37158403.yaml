input_text: 'Impact of prenatal corticosteroid therapy on sickle cell disease in pregnant
  women. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate safety of prenatal corticosteroids in pregnancies
  of women with sickle cell disease. METHODS: A multicenter observational study of
  patients with sickle cell disease, comparing vaso-occlusive crises (VOC) requiring
  hospital care between pregnancies with versus without prenatal corticosteroids.
  RESULTS: In 40 pregnancies exposed to prenatal corticosteroids, compared with 370
  unexposed pregnancies, VOC were not more frequent (62.5% vs 57.9%, P = 0.578) but
  they were more severe, with more intensive care hospitalizations (25.0% vs 12.9%,
  P = 0.039), emergency transfusions (44.7% vs 22.7%, P = 0.006), and acute chest
  syndromes (22.5% vs 8.9%, P = 0.010). These differences persisted after adjustment
  for severity and type of sickle cell syndrome (for intensive care admission adjusted
  odds ratio [aOR] 2.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.10-6.79, P = 0.031 and for
  acute chest syndrome aOR 4.15, 95% CI 1.57-14.4, P = 0.008). VOC occurred on average
  1.2 days following steroid administration. When comparing 36 patients receiving
  corticosteroids for fetal maturation with 58 patients who were hospitalized for
  obstetrical complications before 34 weeks of pregnancy but that did not receive
  corticosteroids, VOC incidence was not significantly higher (41.7% vs 31.5%, P =
  0.323). CONCLUSION: The present study was the first to study the impact of prenatal
  corticosteroids on sickle cell disease. They were associated with more severe VOC,
  suggesting that steroids should be avoided in these women.'
