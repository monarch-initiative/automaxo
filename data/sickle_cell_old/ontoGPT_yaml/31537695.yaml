input_text: 'Extensive multilineage analysis in patients with mixed chimerism after
  allogeneic transplantation for sickle cell disease: insight into hematopoiesis and
  engraftment thresholds for gene therapy. Although studies of mixed chimerism following
  hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD)
  may provide insights into the engraftment needed to correct the disease and into
  immunological reconstitution, an extensive multilineage analysis is lacking. We
  analyzed chimerism simultaneously in peripheral erythroid and granulomonocytic precursors/progenitors,
  highly purified B and T lymphocytes, monocytes, granulocytes and red blood cells
  (RBC). Thirty-four patients with mixed chimerism and >=12 months of follow-up were
  included. A selective advantage of donor RBC and their progenitors/precursors led
  to full chimerism in mature RBC (despite partial engraftment of other lineages),
  and resulted in the clinical control of the disease. Six patients with donor chimerism
  <50% had hemolysis (reticulocytosis) and higher HbS than their donor. Four of them
  had donor chimerism <30%, including a patient with AA donor (hemoglobin >10 g/dL)
  and three with AS donors (hemoglobin <10 g/dL). However, only one vaso-occlusive
  crisis occurred with 68.7% HbS. Except in the patients with the lowest chimerism,
  the donor engraftment was lower for T cells than for the other lineages. In a context
  of mixed chimerism after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for SCD, myeloid
  (rather than T cell) engraftment was the key efficacy criterion. Results show that
  myeloid chimerism as low as 30% was sufficient to prevent a vaso-occlusive crisis
  in transplants from an AA donor but not constantly from an AS donor. However, the
  correction of hemolysis requires higher donor chimerism levels (i.e >=50%) in both
  AA and AS recipients. In the future, this group of patients may need a different
  therapeutic approach.'
