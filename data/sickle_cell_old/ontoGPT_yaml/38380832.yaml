input_text: 'Donors with repeated blood product discards for filtration problems,
  clots or hemolysis: Causes and follow-up. INTRODUCTION: Sanquin donor medicine department
  is informed when donations or their components are rejected. This can occur isolated
  or frequently. It is undesirable because the donations cannot be used and there
  may be an underlying medical cause. Based on regional approaches, a uniform procedure
  was developed. METHODS: Information about whole blood, plasma- plateletpheresis
  donations from which one or more components were rejected for filtration time (>2
  h), hemolysis or clots were extracted from blood bank information system. After
  rejection of two successive components or donations or total >=3 the donor is contacted.
  Depending on the medical history and investigation by the family doctor, the donor
  carrier is re-evaluated. We looked for the causes of the discarded products and
  performed a survey among blood services regarding polices with discarded products.
  RESULTS: One or more components from 1742 of about 2.2 million successful donations
  (0.08%) were rejected. The highest percentage of rejection was seen in plateletpheresis
  (1.5%), all for clots. No underlying medical causes were found. 24 whole blood donors
  were found to have sickle cell trait (SCT) and were permanently deferred. The policies
  for follow-up after discarded products or acceptance of SCT donors vary between
  the 16 blood banks. Six organizations do not follow-up donors and seven accept SCT
  for blood or plasma donation. CONCLUSION: Informing donors with repeated discarded
  products avoids the non-use of donations. Causes of repeated discarded products
  can be found by follow-up of donors. The results of the survey indicate a large
  discrepancy in policies applied worldwide.'
