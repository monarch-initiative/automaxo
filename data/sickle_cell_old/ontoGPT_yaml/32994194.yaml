input_text: 'Remodelling of specialist services enables safe reduction in hospital
  admissions of patients with sickle cell disease: Lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic.
  Sickle cell disease is characterised by recurrent painful crises often leading to
  hospitalisation. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it was important to try to reduce
  the need for hospital admission for these high-risk patients while at the same time
  ensuring that hospital avoidance did not put them at risk of deterioration from
  disease-related complications. In the 3-month period between March and May 2020,
  there was a significant reduction in the number of hospital admissions as well as
  mean length of stay compared with the mean figures over the same months in the preceding
  5 years (2015-19), with an overall reduction in inpatient days of 77%. There were
  no cases of unsafe hospital avoidance or presentations to hospital that were inappropriately
  delayed. Frequent telephone communication with patients and provision of ambulatory
  care were, among others, two very important means of supporting our patient population.'
