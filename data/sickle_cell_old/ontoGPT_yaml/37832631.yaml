input_text: 'CRISPR-based precision medicine for hematologic disorders: Advancements,
  challenges, and prospects. The development of programmable nucleases to introduce
  defined alterations in genomic sequences has been a powerful tool for precision
  medicine. While several nucleases such as zinc-finger nucleases (ZFN), transcriptor
  activator-like effector nucleases (TALEN), and meganucleases have been explored,
  the advent of CRISPR/Cas9 technology has revolutionized the field of genome engineering.
  In addition to disease modeling, the CRISPR/Cas9 technology has contributed to safer
  and more effective treatment strategies for hematologic diseases and personalized
  T-cell-based therapies. Here we discuss the applications of the CRISPR technology
  in the treatment of hematologic diseases, their efficacy, and ongoing clinical trials.
  We examine the obstacles to their successful use and the approaches investigated
  to overcome these challenges. Finally, we provide our perspectives to improve this
  genome editing tool for targeted therapies.'
