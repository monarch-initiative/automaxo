input_text: "Fertility preservation for pediatric patients with hemoglobinopathies:
  Multidisciplinary counseling needed to optimize outcomes. Hemoglobinopathies are
  autosomal recessive disorders that occur when genetic mutations negatively impact
  the function of hemoglobin. Common hemoglobinopathies that are clinically significant
  include sickle cell disease, alpha thalassemia, and beta thalassemia. Advancements
  in disease-modifying and curative treatments for the common hemoglobinopathies over
  the past thirty years have led to improvements in patient quality of life and longevity
  for those who are affected. However, the diseases, their treatments and cures pose
  infertility risks, making fertility preservation counseling and treatment an important
  part of the contemporary comprehensive patient care. Sickle cell disease negatively
  impacts both male and female infertility, primarily by testicular failure and decreased
  ovarian reserve, respectively. Fertility in both males and females with beta thalassemia
  major are negatively impacted by iron deposition due to chronic blood transfusions.
  Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is currently the only curative treatment
  for SCD and transfusion dependent beta thalassemia. Many of the conditioning regimens
  for HSCT contain chemotherapeutic agents with known gonadotoxicity and whole-body
  radiation. Although most clinical studies on toxicity and impact of HSCT on long-term
  health do not evaluate fertility, gonadal failure is common. Male fertility preservation
  modalities that exist prior to gonadotoxic treatment include sperm banking for pubertal
  males and testicular cryopreservation for pre-pubertal boys. For female patients,
  fertility preservation options include oocyte cryopreservation and ovarian tissue
  cryopreservation. Oocyte cryopreservation requires controlled ovarian hyperstimulation
  (COH) with ten to fourteen days of intensive monitoring and medication administration.
  This is feasible once the patient has undergone menarche. Follicular growth is monitored
  via transvaginal or transabdominal ultrasound, and hormone levels are monitored
  through frequent blood work. Oocytes are then harvested via a minimally invasive
  approach under anesthesia. Complications of COH are more common in patients with
  hemoglobinopathies. Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome creates a greater risk to
  patients with underlying vascular, pulmonary, and renal injury, as they may be less
  able to tolerate fluids shifts. Thus, it is critical to monitor patients undergoing
  COH closely with close collaboration between the hematology team and the reproductive
  endocrinology team. Counseling patients and families about future fertility must
  take into consideration the patient's disease, treatment history, and planned treatment,
  acknowledging current knowledge gaps."
