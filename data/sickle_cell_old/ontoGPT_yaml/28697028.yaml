input_text: 'Sciatic (Popliteal Fossa) Catheter for Pediatric Pain Management of Sickle
  Cell Crisis: A Case Report. Sickle cell crisis, or vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC),
  is a major cause of hospitalizations for adults and children with sickle cell disease,
  and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Despite prompt pharmacological
  treatment and multimodal pain management, acute pain during a VOC is often not adequately
  controlled in the pediatric population. We placed a continuous popliteal sciatic
  nerve block under ultrasound guidance in a pediatric patient for localized refractory
  pain during a VOC, resulting in improved pain control with preserved sensorimotor
  function.'
