input_text: 'Pregnancy and sickle cell disease: an overview of complications and suggested
  perinatal care. INTRODUCTION: Pregnancy in women with sickle cell disease (SCD)
  has been identified as high risk owing to increased incidence of materno-fetal complications
  across various studies and reports. These complications include consequences related
  to the underlying hemoglobinopathy; chronic anemia/associated inflammation, and
  pregnancy related including the risk for thromboembolism, bleeding and maternal
  mortality. Outcomes of neonates born to women with SCD has been suboptimal over
  the years with recent improvement due to strict monitoring, preventive and therapeutic
  measures. Much is yet to be unraveled regarding the optimal management of women
  with SCD during pregnancy, identifying target hemoglobin, delivery mode or timing
  among others. AREAS COVERED: This review includes a summary of available data of
  the maternal and fetal outcomes; in addition to current recommendations for monitoring
  and management of women with SCD during pregnancy. EXPERT OPINION: To have a successful
  pregnancy, women should be closely monitored, and interventions provided as needed
  to guarantee adequate management of anemia, as well as prevention, diagnosis and
  management of disease. They should also be educated regarding their reproductive
  health, emphasizing that pregnancy is possible, and achieving optimal results depends
  on providing adequate care in a health care facility with expertise in high-risk
  pregnancies and SCD.'
