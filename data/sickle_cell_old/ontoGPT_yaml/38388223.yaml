input_text: The role of preoperative transfusion in sickle cell disease, a systematic
  review and meta-analysis. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to provide
  guidance on preoperative blood transfusion strategies for patients with sickle cell
  disease (SCD). We included all randomized controlled and observational studies exploring
  the clinical outcomes of preoperative blood transfusion among patients with SCD
  compared to the conservative transfusion strategy until 14/09/2022. Sixteen studies
  involving 3486 participants were analysed. The findings revealed a significantly
  higher bleeding rate in patients who received preoperative transfusion than those
  who followed a conservative strategy (RR = 4.32, 95% CI 1.75-10.68, P = 0.002, I2
  = 0%). However, the two strategies had no significant differences in other clinical
  outcomes, such as acute chest syndrome, painful crisis, fever, neurological complications,
  thrombosis, ICU admission, and mortality. It is important to note that all the included
  studies had a moderate risk of bias. Preoperative transfusion in SCD was associated
  with a higher bleeding risk but a similar risk in other outcomes compared to conservative
  strategies. Notably, the increased bleeding risk observed seldom had clinical significance.
  We recommend individualizing management strategies, considering the overall positive
  impact of transfusions in reducing complications. Further high-quality studies are
  needed to refine recommendations.
