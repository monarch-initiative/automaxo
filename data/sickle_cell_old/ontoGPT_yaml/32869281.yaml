input_text: Changing the Clinical Paradigm of Hydroxyurea Treatment for Sickle Cell
  Anemia Through Precision Medicine. Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is a common and devastating
  inherited blood disorder, affecting millions of people across the world. Without
  treatment, SCA results in tremendous morbidity and early mortality. Hydroxyurea
  is the primary and most well-established pharmacologic therapy with proven benefits
  to ameliorate the clinical course of SCA, primarily due to its ability to increase
  the expression of fetal hemoglobin (HbF), which prevents sickling of red blood cells.
  The optimal induction of HbF depends upon selection and maintenance of the proper
  dose that maximizes benefits and minimizes toxicity. Due to the significant interpatient
  variability in hydroxyurea pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and dosing, most
  patients treated with hydroxyurea receive suboptimal doses and have only modest
  treatment responses. Recognizing this variability, using a precision medicine approach,
  we developed and prospectively evaluated an individualized dosing model for children
  with SCA, designed to optimize the hydroxyurea dose and clinical response. We utilize
  novel laboratory methods and a sparse sampling strategy requiring only 10 muL of
  blood collected 15 minutes, 60 minutes, and 180 minutes after a test dose. We use
  Bayesian adaptive control to estimate hydroxyurea exposure and to select an individual,
  optimal starting dose. This dosing model has resulted in HbF responses >30-40%,
  levels beyond what is achieved with traditional weight-based dosing and trial and
  error dose escalation. This hydroxyurea dosing strategy, if widely implemented,
  has the potential to change the treatment paradigm of hydroxyurea therapy and improve
  outcomes for the millions of patients with SCA across the world.
