input_text: 'The project did not come to us with a solution: Perspectives of research
  teams on implementing a study about electronic health record-embedded individualized
  pain plans for emergency department treatment of vaso-occlusive episodes in adults
  with sickle cell disease. BACKGROUND: This study aimed to capture the implementation
  process of the ALIGN Study, (An individualized Pain Plan with Patient and Provider
  Access for Emergency Department care of Sickle Cell Disease). ALIGN aimed to embed
  Individualized Pain Plans in the electronic health record (E-IPP) and provide access
  to the plan for both adult patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and emergency
  department providers when a person with SCD comes to the emergency department in
  vaso-occlusive crises. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with research
  teams from the 8 participating sites from the ALIGN study. Seventeen participants
  (principal investigators and study coordinators) shared their perspectives about
  the implementation of ALIGN in their sites. Data were analyzed in three phases using
  open coding steps adapted from grounded theory and qualitative content analysis.
  RESULTS: A total of seven overarching themes were identified: (1) the E-IPP structure
  (location and upkeep) and collaboration with the informatics team, (2) the role
  of ED champion, (3) the role of research coordinators, (4) research team communication,
  and communication between research team and clinical team, (5) challenges with the
  study protocol, (6) provider feedback: addressing over-utilizers, patient mistrust,
  and the positive feedback about the intervention, and (7) COVID-19 and its effects
  on study implementation. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study contribute to learning
  how to implement E-IPPs for adult patients with SCD in ED. The study findings highlight
  the importance of early engagement with different team members, a champion from
  the emergency department, study coordinators with different skills and enhancement
  of communication and trust among team members. Further recommendations are outlined
  for hospitals aiming to implement E-IPP for patients with SCD in ED.'
