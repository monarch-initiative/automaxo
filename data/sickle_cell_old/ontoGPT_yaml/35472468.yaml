input_text: "Pediatric Vulvovaginal Graft-Versus-Host Disease: A Retrospective Cohort
  Study and Literature Review. STUDY OBJECTIVE: To assess genital symptomatology,
  characterize the findings of genital examination, and describe the incidence and
  treatment of vulvovaginal graft-versus-host disease (vvGvHD) in girls and adolescents
  after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). DESIGN: Retrospective
  cohort. SETTING: Metropolitan-area children's hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Female allogeneic
  HSCT recipients ages 0 to 22 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Genital symptoms, genital
  examination, diagnosis, and treatment of vvGvHD. RESULTS: A total of 57 participants
  were included in the analysis. The median age at the time of HSCT was 10 years (range
  4 months-23 years). Most (n = 40, 71%) underwent transplant for a nonmalignant condition,
  most commonly sickle cell anemia (n = 19, 33%). The median time of onset of GvHD
  post HSCT was 62 days (IQR = 42 to 151 days). The most common initial site of GvHD
  was skin (n = 21, 64%), followed by GI tract (n = 10, 30%). Three patients (5%)
  were diagnosed with vvGvHD. The time of onset of vvGvHD post HSCT ranged from 62
  to 1565 days. One patient (33%) was asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. There
  was no difference in diagnosis of vvGvHD when race (P = 0.15), age at allogeneic
  HSCT (P = 0.64), nonmalignant vs malignant indication (P = 0.21), source of stem
  cells (P = 0.25), partial vs full human leukocyte antigens (HLA) donor match (P
  = 0.34), and GvHD prophylaxis regimen (P = 0.18) were compared. None had isolated
  vvGvHD. Vulvovaginal GvHD was preceded by skin GvHD in 1 patient, was preceded by
  lung GvHD in 1 patient, and occurred concurrently with skin GvHD in the third patient.
  CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric vvGvHD can occur within the first 100 days after transplant
  and can be asymptomatic. Routine gynecologic evaluation post allogeneic HSCT in
  children and adolescents should include a thorough review of vulvovaginal symptoms
  and a gynecologic exam for the detection and treatment of vvGvHD."
