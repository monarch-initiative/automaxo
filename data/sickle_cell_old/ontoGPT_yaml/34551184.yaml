input_text: 'A systematic review of cases of West African crystalline maculopathy.
  AIM: West African crystalline maculopathy (WACM) is, reportedly, a rare condition
  whose aetiology remains unclear. This study aims to describe the epidemiology, summarizing
  the identified risk factors and clinical characteristics of cases of WACM, with
  the goal of highlighting presentation patterns and the clinical course of the condition.
  METHODS: A comprehensive PubMed, Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science, OMIM and Google
  scholar search of all articles written in English, and non-English language articles
  with abstract translated to English on WACM was carried out. Only full case reports
  and series were included. Data reviewed included epidemiology, risk factors, clinical
  presentations, imaging characteristics, management and prognosis of WACM. Information
  on the location of the study was also extracted. RESULTS: Ten studies - seven case
  reports and three case series - comprising of 30 patients were included. The patients
  were from West, Central and North-east Africa, with all the studies carried out
  in North America and Europe. The majority of the patients (76.7%) had diabetes mellitus,
  80% had a vascular retinopathy (diabetic retinopathy, sickle cell retinopathy, familial
  exudative vitreoretinopathy and branch retinal vein occlusion) and 50% had macular
  oedema. There was no report of associated visual impairment or retinal degeneration.
  Clinical improvement in the number of crystals was documented in two cases with
  retinal laser photocoagulation for associated vascular retinopathies. Clinical observation
  was employed by most clinicians. CONCLUSION: West African crystalline retinopathy
  is a seemingly innocuous condition affecting black or African people, who were also
  born in Africa. The majority of the patients have a vascular retinopathy. Longitudinal
  studies, particularly in Africa, may be required to elucidate the aetiology, as
  well as the long-term prognosis, of the crystals.'
