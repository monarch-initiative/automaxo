input_text: 'Parents of Children with Sickle Cell Disease Are Interested in Preimplantation
  Genetic Testing. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate awareness of and attitudes toward preimplantation
  genetic testing (PGT) for sickle cell disease (SCD) among parents of children with
  SCD. STUDY DESIGN: Parents of children with SCD were given an educational handbook
  on PGT before a routine SCD clinic visit. After their clinic visit, parents were
  asked to complete an anonymous survey. RESULTS: Of 83 patents approached, 67 (81%)
  completed the survey. Only 16 of the 67 parents (24%) were previously aware of PGT
  for SCD. After our clinic-based education, 65 of the 67 parents (97%) indicated
  that it was important or very important for parents of children with SCD to know
  about PGT. Among parents interested in having more children, 29 of 32 (91%) would
  personally consider using PGT if covered by insurance. CONCLUSIONS: Parents of children
  with SCD are generally not aware of PGT. When educated in clinic, parents viewed
  information on PGT as valuable. Pediatricians and other health care professionals
  should inform parents of children with SCD about this reproductive option.'
