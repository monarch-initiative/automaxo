input_text: '[Population characterization of mutations for sickle cell anemia and
  its treatment: One step towards personalized medicine for the disease]. Sickle cell
  anemia (SCA) is the most common genetic disease worldwide. There are countries with
  massive public health programs for early detection of this condition. In the literature,
  several specific haplotypes or single-base polymorphic variants (SNPs) have been
  associated with the SCA prognosis. OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the significant correlation
  of SNPs relevant to the diagnosis and prognosis of SCA among different ethnic groups.
  METHODOLOGY: we analyzed population frequencies and correlations of several SNPs
  related to the prognosis of SCA (i.e., baseline fetal hemoglobin levels), response
  to hydroxyurea treatment, and response to other drugs used in the SCA treatment,
  collected from validated genomic databases among different ethnic groups. RESULTS:
  The calculation of the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and the logistic regression was
  successful in classifying the ethnic groups as African (0 = 0.78, 1 = 0.89), and
  with a lower efficiency as American (AMR) (0 = 0.88, 1 = 0.00), East Asian (EAS)
  (0 = 0.80, 1 = 0.00), European (EUR) (0 = 0.79, 1 = 0.00), and South Asian (SAS)
  (0 = 0.80, 1 = 0.00). CONCLUSIONS: The results extend those from previous reports
  and show that the profile of most of the SNPs studied presented statistically significant
  distributions among general ethnic groups, pointing to the need to carry out massive
  early screening of relevant SNPs for SCA in patients diagnosed with this disease.
  It is concluded that the application of a broad mutation detection program will
  lead to a more personalized and efficient response in the treatment of SCA.'
