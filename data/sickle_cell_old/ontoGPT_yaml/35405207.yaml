input_text: 'Black and White Adults With CKD Hospitalized With Acute Kidney Injury:
  Findings From the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study. RATIONALE & OBJECTIVE:
  Few studies have investigated racial disparities in acute kidney injury (AKI), in
  contrast to the extensive literature on racial differences in the risk of kidney
  failure. We sought to study potential differences in risk in the setting of chronic
  kidney disease (CKD). STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS:
  We studied 2,720 self-identified Black or White participants with CKD enrolled in
  the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study from July 1, 2013, to December
  31, 2017. EXPOSURE: Self-reported race (Black vs White). OUTCOME: Hospitalized AKI
  (>=50% increase from nadir to peak serum creatinine). ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Cox regression
  models adjusting for demographics (age and sex), prehospitalization clinical risk
  factors (diabetes, blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, estimated glomerular
  filtration rate, proteinuria, receipt of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors
  or angiotensin-receptor blockers), and socioeconomic status (insurance status and
  education level). In a subset of participants with genotype data, we adjusted for
  apolipoprotein L1 gene (APOL1) high-risk status and sickle cell trait. RESULTS:
  Black participants (n = 1,266) were younger but had a higher burden of prehospitalization
  clinical risk factors. The incidence rate of first AKI hospitalization among Black
  participants was 6.3 (95% CI, 5.5-7.2) per 100 person-years versus 5.3 (95% CI,
  4.6-6.1) per 100 person-years among White participants. In an unadjusted Cox regression
  model, Black participants were at a modestly increased risk of incident AKI (HR,
  1.22 [95% CI, 1.01-1.48]) compared with White participants. However, this risk was
  attenuated and no longer significant after adjusting for prehospitalization clinical
  risk factors (adjusted HR, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.83-1.25]). There were only 11 AKI hospitalizations
  among individuals with high-risk APOL1 risk status and 14 AKI hospitalizations among
  individuals with sickle cell trait. LIMITATIONS: Participants were limited to research
  volunteers and potentially not fully representative of all CKD patients. CONCLUSIONS:
  In this multicenter prospective cohort of CKD patients, racial disparities in AKI
  incidence were modest and were explained by differences in prehospitalization clinical
  risk factors.'
