input_text: 'Stable to improved cardiac and pulmonary function in children with high-risk
  sickle cell disease following haploidentical stem cell transplantation. Children
  with sickle cell disease (SCD) are at high-risk of progressive, chronic pulmonary
  and cardiac dysfunction. In this prospective multicenter Phase II trial of myeloimmunoablative
  conditioning followed by haploidentical stem cell transplantation in children with
  high-risk SCD, 19 patients, 2.0-21.0 years of age, were enrolled with one or more
  of the following: history of (1) overt stroke; (2) silent stroke; (3) elevated transcranial
  Doppler velocity; (4) multiple vaso-occlusive crises; and/or (5) two or more acute
  chest syndromes and received haploidentical transplants from 18 parental donors.
  Cardiac and pulmonary centralized cores were established. Pulmonary function results
  were expressed as percent of the median of healthy reference cohorts, matched for
  age, sex, height and race. At 2 years, pulmonary functions including forced expiratory
  volume (FEV), FEV1/ forced vital capacity (FVC), total lung capacity (TLC), diffusing
  capacity of lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) were stable to improved compared to
  baseline values. Importantly, specific airway conductance was significantly improved
  at 2 years (p < 0.004). Left ventricular systolic function (fractional shortening)
  and tricuspid regurgitant velocity were stable at 2 years. These results demonstrate
  that haploidentical stem cell transplantation can stabilize or improve cardiopulmonary
  function in patients with SCD.'
