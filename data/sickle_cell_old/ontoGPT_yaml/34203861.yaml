input_text: Critical Role of Hemopexin Mediated Cytoprotection in the Pathophysiology
  of Sickle Cell Disease. Circulating hemopexin is the primary protein responsible
  for the clearance of heme; therefore, it is a systemic combatant against deleterious
  inflammation and oxidative stress induced by the presence of free heme. This role
  of hemopexin is critical in hemolytic pathophysiology. In this review, we outline
  the current research regarding how the dynamic activity of hemopexin is implicated
  in sickle cell disease, which is characterized by a pathological aggregation of
  red blood cells and excessive hemolysis. This pathophysiology leads to symptoms
  such as acute kidney injury, vaso-occlusion, ischemic stroke, pain crises, and pulmonary
  hypertension exacerbated by the presence of free heme and hemoglobin. This review
  includes in vivo studies in mouse, rat, and guinea pig models of sickle cell disease,
  as well as studies in human samples. In summary, the current research indicates
  that hemopexin is likely protective against these symptoms and that rectifying depleted
  hemopexin in patients with sickle cell disease could improve or prevent the symptoms.
  The data compiled in this review suggest that further preclinical and clinical research
  should be conducted to uncover pathways of hemopexin in pathological states to evaluate
  its potential clinical function as both a biomarker and therapy for sickle cell
  disease and related hemoglobinopathies.
