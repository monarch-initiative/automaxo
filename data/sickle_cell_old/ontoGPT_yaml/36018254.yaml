input_text: "Simple open-heart surgery protocol for sickle-cell disease patients:
  a retrospective cohort study comparing patients undergoing mitral valve surgery.
  OBJECTIVES: Sickle-cell disease (SCD) patients are considered to be at high risk
  from open-heart surgery. This study assessed the role of a simple sickling-prevention
  protocol. METHODS: Perioperative non-specific and SCD-specific morbidity and 30-day
  mortality are investigated in a retrospective cohort study on patients undergoing
  isolated mitral valve surgery. Patients with and without SCD were compared. In the
  SCD cohort, a bundle of interventions was applied to limit the risk of sickling:
  'on-demand' transfusions to keep haemoglobin levels of around 7-8 g/dl, cardiopulmonary
  bypass (CPB) with higher blood flow and perfusion temperature, close monitoring
  of acid-base balance and oxygenation. RESULTS: Twenty patients with and 40 patients
  without SCD were included. At baseline, only preoperative haemoglobin levels differed
  between cohorts (8.1 vs 11.8 g/dl, P < 0.001). Solely SCD patients received preoperative
  transfusions (45.0%). Intraoperative transfusions were significantly larger in SCD
  patients during CPB (priming: 300 vs 200 ml; entire length: 600 vs 300 ml and 20
  vs 10 ml/kg). SCD patients had higher perfusion temperatures during CPB (34.7 vs
  33.0 C, P = 0.01) with consequently higher pharyngeal temperature, both during cooling
  (34.1 vs 32.3 C, P = 0.02) and rewarming (36.5 vs 36.2 C, P = 0.02). No mortality
  occurred, and non-SCD-specific complications were comparable between groups, but
  one SCD patient suffered from perioperative cerebrovascular accident with seizures,
  and another had evident haemolysis. CONCLUSIONS: SCD patients may undergo open-heart
  surgery for mitral valve procedures with an acceptable risk profile. Simple but
  thoughtful perioperative management, embracing 'on-demand' transfusions and less-aggressive
  CPB cooling is feasible and probably efficacious."
