input_text: 'Decreased risk of underdosing with continuous infusion versus intermittent
  administration of cefotaxime in patients with sickle cell disease and acute chest
  syndrome. OBJECTIVE: Underdosing of antibiotics is common in patients with sickle
  cell disease (SCD). We hypothesized that in critically-ill patients with SCD receiving
  cefotaxime during acute chest syndrome, the continuous infusion may outperform the
  intermittent administration in achieving pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic targets.
  DESIGN: Prospective before-after study. SETTINGS: Intensive-care unit of a French
  teaching hospital and sickle cell disease referral center. PATIENTS: Sixty consecutive
  episodes of severe acute chest syndrome in 58 adult patients with sickle cell disease.
  INTERVENTIONS: Patients were treated with intermittent administration during the
  first period (April 2016 -April 2018) and with continuous infusion during the second
  period (May 2018 -August 2019). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We included 60 episodes
  of acute chest syndrome in 58 patients (29 [25-34] years, 37/58 (64%) males). Daily
  dose of cefotaxime was similar between groups (59 [48-88] vs. 61 [57-64] mg/kg/day,
  p = 0.84). Most patients (>75%) presented a glomerular hyperfiltration with no difference
  between groups (p = 0.25). More patients had a cefotaxime trough level >=2 mg/L
  with continuous infusion than intermittent administration: 28 (93%) vs. 5 (16%),
  p<0.001. The median residual concentration was higher in the continuous infusion
  than intermittent administration group: 10.5 [7.4-13.3] vs. 0 [0-0] mg/L, p<0.001.
  No infection relapse was observed in the entire cohort. Hospital length of stay
  was similar between groups. CONCLUSION: As compared to intermittent administration,
  continuous infusion of cefotaxime maximizes the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic
  parameters in patients with SCD. The clinical outcome did not differ between the
  two administration methods; however, the study was underpowered to detect such a
  difference.'
