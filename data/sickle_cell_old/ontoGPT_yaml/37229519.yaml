input_text: 'Using an individualized pain management plan for African American adults
  with sickle cell disease. BACKGROUND: The increased lifespan of individuals having
  sickle cell disease (SCD) causes an overall increase in hospitalizations and more
  instances in which pain may not be well controlled. LOCAL PROBLEM: The mainstay
  treatment for severe pain is opioids and the underlying cause. Laws affecting opioid
  prescribing, implicit bias, racial inequity, poor research funding, and lack of
  knowledge contribute to poor patient outcomes. METHOD: Data were collected retrospectively
  using electronic medical record data from before and after the intervention. INTERVENTION:
  The individualized pain management plan (IPMP) was initiated in collaboration with
  the patient, pain nurse practitioner (NP), and hematologist. RESULT: The mean length
  of stay for the traditional pain management plan (TPMP) was 7.89 days compared with
  5.66 days for the IPMP, with a mean difference of 2.23 days, t = 2.278, p = .024
  (p < .05). There was a decrease in the admission of the individuals with the IPMP,
  with 25% readmitted within 30 days of discharge, versus 59.0% who were readmitted
  using the TPMP. Chi-square showed statistical significance (chi2 = 61.667, p = .000)
  in using nonpharmacological interventions with the IPMP group. CONCLUSION: The IPMP
  with a patient-centered approach did improve patient outcomes for African American
  adults living with SCD.'
