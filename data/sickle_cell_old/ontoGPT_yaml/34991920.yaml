input_text: 'l-glutamine, crizanlizumab, voxelotor, and cell-based therapy for adult
  sickle cell disease: Hype or hope? For more than two decades, hydroxyurea was the
  only therapeutic agent approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for sickle
  cell disease (SCD). Although curative allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants
  (allo-HSCT) were also available, only very few patients underwent the procedure
  due to lack of matched-related donors. However, therapeutic options for SCD patients
  increased dramatically in the last few years. Three new agents, l-glutamine, crizanlizumab,
  and voxelotor, were approved by the FDA for use in SCD patients. The number of SCD
  patients who underwent allo-HSCT also increased as a result of advances in the prevention
  of graft failure and graft-versus-host disease from using mismatched donor HSC.
  More recently gene therapy was made available on clinical trials. The increased
  treatment options for SCD have led to a sense of optimism and excitement among many
  physicians that these new approaches would alter the clinical course and disease
  burden. Although these newer agents do provide hope to SCD patients, the hyped-up
  responses need to be evaluated in the context of reality. In this review, we will
  discuss and compare these new agents and cell-based therapy, evaluate their clinical
  and economic impacts, and examine their roles in reducing the disease burden.'
