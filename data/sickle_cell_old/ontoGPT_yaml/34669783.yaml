input_text: Comparative metavirome analysis in polytransfused patients. Due to the
  high transfusion volume, polytransfused patients with sickle cell disease (SCD)
  and beta-thalassemia are constantly exposed to parenterally transmitted infections.
  Currently, we have little information about the virome of such patients and how
  the virological composition might be influenced by the hemotherapy procedures that
  these patients receive. The objective of this study was to compare the viral diversity
  between these two groups with respect to the viral abundance and how it might be
  affected by the specific conditions of these groups. We sequenced by next-generation
  sequencing (NGS) and compared the virome of 30 patients with beta-thalassemia major,
  45 with SCD, and 16 blood donors from the Blood Center of Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.
  Predominantly, commensal viruses including Torque teno virus (TTV) genotypes and
  human pegiviris-1 (HPgV-1) were identified in each group. Strikingly, while HPgV-1
  reads were dominant in the SCD group, thalassemic patients showed high TTV abundance,
  expressed both in viral reads and genotypes. We speculated that the commensal virome
  of polytransfused patients might be influenced by the transfusion frequency and
  disease characteristics and that commensal viruses might be used as important genetic
  biomarkers for these hematological disturbances. Nevertheless, more specific studies
  are necessary to confirm a relationship between blood virome and transfusion treatment.
