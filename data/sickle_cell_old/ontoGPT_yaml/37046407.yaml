input_text: 'Feasibility study of busulfan, fludarabine, and thiotepa conditioning
  regimen for allogeneic hematopoietic stemcell transplantationfor children and young
  adults with nonmalignant disorders. BACKGROUND: Hematopoietic stem cell transplant
  (HSCT) is the only curative treatment for several pediatric non-malignant disorders.
  A widely used conditioning backbone is busulfan, fludarabine, and rabbit anti-thymocyte
  globulin (rATG). Thiotepa has improved engraftment when added to this regimen, however
  the minimum effective dose (MED) of thiotepa to achieve engraftment while minimizing
  toxicities has not been well established. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this
  prospective feasibility study was to determine the MED of thiotepa (5mg/kg) in combination
  with reduced-dose busulfan, fludarabine or cyclophosphamide, and rATG required to
  achieve engraftment in >90% of HSCT recipients for non-malignant disorders with
  acceptable toxicity. RESULTS: Six patients who received fully matched HSCT were
  enrolled. Patient diagnoses included Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (n = 1), CD40L deficiency
  (n = 1), sickle cell disease (n = 2), autoinflammatory syndrome (n = 1), and paroxysmal
  nocturnal hemoglobinuria (n = 1). All six patients achieved engraftment prior to
  Day +42 and five patients had stable full donor engraftment. Two of the six patients
  (33%) developed acute GVHD and/or chronic GHVD, both of whom had sickle cell disease.
  At a median follow-up of 2.25 years post-transplant, all patients were alive without
  evidence of disease recurrence. None of the patients experienced grade 4 or 5 toxicities.
  Three out of six patients (50%) developed grade 3 adverse events. Neurocognitive
  functioning of children under 10 years of age was not adversely affected by this
  regimen. CONCLUSION: This approach shows acceptable toxicity and reliable engraftment
  in children with non-malignant disorders receiving related or unrelated HLA-matched
  transplants.'
