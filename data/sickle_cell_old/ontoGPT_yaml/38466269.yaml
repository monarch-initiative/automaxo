input_text: 'Opioid Prescribing and Outcomes in Patients With Sickle Cell Disease
  Post-2016 CDC Guideline. Importance: Although the intention of the 2016 US Centers
  for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic
  Pain was not to limit pain treatment for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD),
  clinicians and patients have recognized the possibility that the guideline may have
  altered outcomes for this population. However, the outcomes of the 2016 guideline
  for this patient population are unknown. Objective: To examine changes in opioid
  prescribing patterns and health outcomes among patients with SCD before and after
  the release of the 2016 CDC guideline. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective
  cohort study conducted interrupted time series analysis of claims data from the
  Merative MarketScan Commercial Database from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2019.
  In this population-based study in the US, individuals with SCD who were at least
  1 year of age, had no cancer diagnosis, and had pharmacy coverage for the month
  of measurement were included. The data were analyzed from January 2021 to November
  2023. Exposure: The CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain released
  in March 2016. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main variables measured in this study
  included the practice of opioid prescribing among patients with SCD (ie, rate of
  opioid prescriptions dispensed, mean number of days supplied, mean total morphine
  milligram equivalents [MME] per patient, and mean daily MME per opioid prescription)
  and pain-related health outcomes (rates of emergency department visits related to
  vaso-occlusive crises [VOC] and hospitalizations related to VOC). Results: The cohort
  included 14 979 patients with SCD (mean [SD] age, 25.9 [16.9] years; 8520 [56.9%]
  female). Compared with the preguideline trends, the following changes were observed
  after the guideline was released: significant decreases in the coefficient for change
  in slope of the opioid dispensing rate (-0.29 [95% CI, -0.39 to -0.20] prescriptions
  per 100 person-month; P < .001), the number of days supplied per prescription (-0.05
  [95% CI, -0.06 to -0.04] days per prescription-month; P < .001), and opioid dosage
  (-141.0 [95% CI, -219.5 to -62.5] MME per person-month; P = .001; -10.1 [95% CI,
  -14.6 to -5.6] MME/prescription-month; P < .001). Conversely, a significant increase
  in VOC-related hospitalizations occurred after the guideline release (0.16 [95%
  CI, 0.07-0.25] hospitalizations per 100 person-month; P = .001). These changes were
  observed to a greater extent among adult patients, but pediatric patients experienced
  similar changes in several measures, even though the guideline focused exclusively
  on adult patients. Conclusions and Relevance: This retrospective cohort study showed
  that the 2016 CDC guideline may have had unintended negative outcomes on the patient
  population living with SCD.'
