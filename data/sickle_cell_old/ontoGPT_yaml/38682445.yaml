input_text: Optimization of single-needle red cell exchange in patients with sickle
  cell disease. The hypercoagulable state associated with sickle cell disease (SCD)
  can be challenging for apheresis procedures. Among 62 single-needle red cell exchanges
  (SN-RCEs) performed over a 15-month period, 4 patients experienced 6 hemolytic events
  with a discolored plasma layer, elevated plasma/RBC interface in the centrifuge,
  and accompanying alarms of "Cells were detected in plasma line from centrifuge"
  or "AIM system detected RBC at top of connector." The hemolysis originated from
  the apheresis instrument because samples from the apheresis belt but not the patients'
  peripheral blood were positive for hemolysis. Further analysis showed the alarms
  occurred more often in SN-RCEs (20.4%) than double-needle RCEs (2.7%), and the hemolysis
  was probably secondary to clumping. To optimize SN-RCE, we increased the anticoagulant
  dosage by changing Inlet/AC ratio from 13 to 8 and lowered the inlet rate to the
  level comparable to double-needle RCE. The adjustments were well-tolerated with
  no more hemolysis.
