input_text: "Serial prophylactic exchange blood transfusion in pregnant women with
  sickle cell disease (TAPS-2): study protocol for a randomised controlled feasibility
  trial. BACKGROUND: Pregnancies in women with sickle cell disease (SCD) are associated
  with a higher risk of sickle and pregnancy complications. Limited options exist
  for treating SCD during pregnancy. Serial prophylactic exchange blood transfusion
  (SPEBT) has been shown to be effective in treating SCD outside pregnancy, but evidence
  is lacking regarding its use during pregnancy. The aim of this study is to assess
  the feasibility and acceptability of conducting a future phase 3 randomised controlled
  trial (RCT) to establish the clinical and cost effectiveness of SPEBT in pregnant
  women with SCD. METHODS: The study is an individually randomised, two-arm, feasibility
  trial with embedded qualitative and health economic studies. Fifty women, 18 years
  of age and older, with SCD and a singleton pregnancy at <= 18 weeks' gestation will
  be recruited from six hospitals in England. Randomisation will be conducted using
  a secure online database and minimised by centre, SCD genotype and maternal age.
  Women allocated to the intervention arm will receive SPEBT commencing at <= 18 weeks'
  gestation, performed using automated erythrocytapheresis every 6-10 weeks until
  the end of pregnancy, aiming to maintain HbS% or combined HbS/HbC% below 30%. Women
  in the standard care arm will only receive transfusion when clinically indicated.
  The primary outcome will be the recruitment rate. Additional endpoints include reasons
  for refusal to participate, attrition rate, protocol adherence, and maternal and
  neonatal outcomes. Women will be monitored throughout pregnancy to assess maternal,
  sickle, and foetal complications. Detailed information about adverse events (including
  hospital admission) and birth outcomes will be extracted from medical records and
  via interview at 6 weeks postpartum. An embedded qualitative study will consist
  of interviews with (a) 15-25 trial participants to assess experiences and acceptability,
  (b) 5-15 women who decline to participate to identify barriers to recruitment and
  (c) 15-20 clinical staff to explore fidelity and acceptability. A health economic
  study will inform a future cost effectiveness and cost-utility analysis. DISCUSSION:
  This feasibility study aims to rigorously evaluate SPEBT as a treatment for SCD
  in pregnancy and its impact on maternal and infant outcomes. TRIAL REGISTRATION:
  NIH registry (www.clinicaltrials.gov), registration number NCT03975894 (registered
  05/06/19); ISRCTN (www.isrctn.com), registration number ISRCTN52684446 (retrospectively
  registered 02/08/19)."
