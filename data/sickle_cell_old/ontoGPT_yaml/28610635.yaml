input_text: 'Cellular function reinstitution of offspring red blood cells cloned from
  the sickle cell disease patient blood post CRISPR genome editing. BACKGROUND: Sickle
  cell disease (SCD) is a disorder of red blood cells (RBCs) expressing abnormal hemoglobin-S
  (HbS) due to genetic inheritance of homologous HbS gene. However, people with the
  sickle cell trait (SCT) carry a single allele of HbS and do not usually suffer from
  SCD symptoms, thus providing a rationale to treat SCD. METHODS: To validate gene
  therapy potential, hematopoietic stem cells were isolated from the SCD patient blood
  and treated with CRISPR/Cas9 approach. To precisely dissect genome-editing effects,
  erythroid progenitor cells were cloned from single colonies of CRISPR-treated cells
  and then expanded for simultaneous gene, protein, and cellular function studies.
  RESULTS: Genotyping and sequencing analysis revealed that the genome-edited erythroid
  progenitor colonies were converted to SCT genotype from SCD genotype. HPLC protein
  assays confirmed reinstallation of normal hemoglobin at a similar level with HbS
  in the cloned genome-edited erythroid progenitor cells. For cell function evaluation,
  in vitro RBC differentiation of the cloned erythroid progenitor cells was induced.
  As expected, cell sickling assays indicated function reinstitution of the genome-edited
  offspring SCD RBCs, which became more resistant to sickling under hypoxia condition.
  CONCLUSIONS: This study is an exploration of genome editing of SCD HSPCs.'
