input_text: Managing patients with sickle cell disease in primary care. Sickle cell
  disease (SCD) is a group of disorders affecting the hemoglobin in erythrocytes.
  SCD is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and occurs most commonly
  among people of African ancestry. In 2014, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute
  updated its guidelines for the management of SCD. These guidelines were implemented
  to provide evidence-based recommendations to assist primary care clinicians in the
  proper management of patients with SCD. This article reviews the current practice
  guidelines for SCD, with attention to health maintenance and hydroxyurea.
