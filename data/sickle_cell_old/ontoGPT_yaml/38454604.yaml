input_text: "Autologous Gene Therapy for Hemoglobinopathies: From Bench to Patient's
  Bedside. In recent years, a growing number of clinical trials have been initiated
  to evaluate gene therapy approaches for the treatment of patients with transfusion-dependent
  beta-thalassemia (TDT) and sickle cell disease (SCD). Therapeutic modalities being
  assessed in these trials utilize different molecular techniques, including lentiviral
  vectors to add functional copies of the gene encoding the hemoglobin beta subunit
  in defective cells and CRISPR/Cas9, TALE nuclease (TALEN), and zinc finger nuclease
  (ZFN) gene editing strategies to either directly address the underlying genetic
  cause of disease or induce fetal hemoglobin production by gene disruption. Here,
  we review the mechanisms of action of these various gene addition and gene editing
  approaches and describe the status of clinical trials designed to evaluate the potentially
  for these approaches to provide one-time functional cures to patients with TDT and
  SCD."
