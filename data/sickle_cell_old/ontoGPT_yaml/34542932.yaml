input_text: 'Influenza vaccination rates and hospitalizations among Medicaid enrollees
  with and without sickle cell disease, 2009-2015. BACKGROUND: Personswith sickle
  cell disease (SCD) face increased risks for pulmonary and infection-related complications.
  This study examines influenza vaccination coverage and estimates influenza-related
  morbidity among Medicaid enrollees with and without SCD. PROCEDURE: Influenza vaccination
  coverage and hospitalizations related to influenza and pneumonia/acute chest syndrome
  (ACS) during each influenza season from 2009-2010 to 2014-2015 were assessed among
  enrollees in the IBM MarketScan  Multi-State Medicaid Database. Enrollees with SCD
  were identified as enrollees with greater than or equal to three claims listing
  SCD within a 5-year period during 2003-2017. Vaccinations were identified in outpatient
  claims. Hospitalizations associated with influenza or pneumonia/ACS were identified
  using inpatient claims. This study includes a series of cross-sectional assessments
  by season. RESULTS: From 2009-2010 through 2014-2015 seasons, the SCD sample ranged
  from 5044 to 8651 enrollees; the non-SCD sample ranged from 1,841,756 to 3,796,337
  enrollees. Influenza vaccination coverage was higher among enrollees with SCD compared
  with enrollees without SCD for all seasons (24.5%-33.6% and 18.2%-22.0%, respectively).
  Age-standardized rates of influenza-related hospitalizations were 20-42 times higher
  among SCD enrollees compared with non-SCD enrollees, and ACS/pneumonia hospitalizations
  were 18-29 times higher. Among enrollees with SCD, influenza-related hospitalization
  rates were highest among children aged 0-9 years. Among enrollees without SCD, influenza-related
  hospitalization rates were highest among adults aged 40-64 years. CONCLUSIONS: Although
  vaccine coverage was higher in persons with versus without SCD, efforts to increase
  influenza coverage further are warranted for this high-risk group, who experienced
  markedly higher rates of influenza and ACS/pneumonia hospitalizations during each
  season.'
