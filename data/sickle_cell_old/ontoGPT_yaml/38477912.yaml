input_text: 'Consequence of RBC Deformability On Heat Sink Effect of Blood in a Three
  Dimensional Bifurcated Vessel. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study
  is to analyze the effect of RBC shape and deformation on blood heat transfer of
  a tumor patient suffering from blood disorders when being treated with hyperthermia
  procedure. METHODS: Euler-Euler multiphase method along with granular model is used
  in this study to simulate blood flow in a bifurcated vessel. Kinetic theory is used
  to include particle nature of RBCs during blood flow in the current model. RESULTS:
  An increase of 0.25 K in blood temperature is noticed during a cardiac cycle for
  diseased patient compared to normal patient. These results indicate that blood disorders
  can alter the heat sink effect and blood heat transfer in a bifurcated vessel, which
  also affects the efficacy and efficiency of tumor treatment procedure. Hence, blood
  disorder (where the morphology of RBC is altered) of a patient needs to be taken
  into consideration when thermal therapy is being used for tumor treatment. CONCLUSION:
  Both spatial and transient Nusselt number of a normal patient is higher compared
  to a blood diseased patient which indicates a higher heat transfer in case of normal
  patient compared to the later, when treated with similar ablation procedure. So
  for a tumor patient suffering from blood disorder, modification in hyperthermia
  procedure needs to be done compared to a normal patient for complete infected cell
  necrosis and minimal destruction of healthy tissues.'
