                    "text": "INTRODUCTION: The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute guidelines for sickle cell disease (SCD) pain crisis management recommend opioids within 60 minutes of emergency department (ED) registration and every 30 minutes thereafter until acute pain is managed. These guidelines are based on expert opinion without published, supporting data. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between timely ED opioid administration and hospitalization rates in children with SCD. METHODS: Retrospective cohort of children presenting to a children's hospital ED with SCD pain between January 1, 2014, and April 30, 2018. Visits were extracted using ICD codes, chief complaints, and receipt of at least one opioid, and then reviewed to confirm the visit was an uncomplicated pain crisis. The primary outcome was hospitalization, yes or no. Generalized estimating equations were used to determine adjusted odds of hospitalization for the timely administration of initial and second doses of opioids. RESULTS: Of the 902 eligible visits, 368 (40.8%) resulted in hospitalization. The mean (SD) age was 11.9 (+- 5.2) years. The first opioid was administered within 60 minutes of arrival in 601 (66.6%) visits. The second opioid was administered within 30 minutes of the first in 84 (12.3%) visits. Receipt of the first opioid within 60 minutes of arrival was not associated with decreased hospitalization (1.30 [0.96-1.76]). However, receipt of the second dose within 30 minutes of the first was associated with decreased hospitalization (0.56 [0.33-0.94]). CONCLUSION: This study suggests an association between children with SCD receiving a second dose within 30 minutes of the first opioid dose and decreased hospitalizations.",
