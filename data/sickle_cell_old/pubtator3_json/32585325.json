Unfortunately, many young people fall out of clinical care during this important time, leading to worsening cardiovascular risk and missed opportunities to modify future outcomes. The field of health care transition has evolved to support young people with complex health needs in developing self-management and self-advocacy skills to promote positive health outcomes despite changes in health care providers and resources. While transitional care efforts are largely focused on childhood-onset chronic illnesses such as sickle cell disease and cystic fibrosis, young people with cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, obesity, and dyslipidemia also stand to benefit from structured supports to ensure continuity in care and positive health behaviours. On the backdrop of the broader health care transition literature, we offer practical insights and suggestions for ensuring that young people with cardiovascular risk factors experience uninterrupted high-quality care and support as they enter the adult health care system. Starting transition preparation in early adolescence, actively engaging all key stakeholders throughout the process, and remaining mindful of the developmental underpinnings and social context of transition are keys to success.",
