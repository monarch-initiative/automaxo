Self-management support may help improve transition outcomes in this vulnerable population. Interventions based on teaching problem solving skills have been shown to improve adherence to therapy for AYA with other chronic disease and is a promising intervention in SCD. We sought patient and parent perspectives on improving self-management and input on the development of a problem-solving education (PSE) intervention. DESIGN AND METHODS: We held focus groups with AYA with SCD and caregivers to discuss barriers and facilitators of self-management, acceptability of PSE and intervention content and delivery. RESULTS: Five focus groups were held with AYA (n = 17) and caregivers (n = 15). Groups participated jointly to discuss self-management and then separately to discuss PSE. Data were analyzed using grounded theory and double-coded until thematic saturation was achieved. CONCLUSIONS: Both groups endorsed PSE as an acceptable intervention. Barriers to self-management included wanting to fit in with peers (AYA) and trouble letting go (parents); facilitators included having a regular routine (AYA) and sharing responsibility (parents). Participants suggested meeting in small groups for PSE sessions rather than individually and adding group sessions for parents. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Understanding AYA and caregivers' perceptions of barriers and facilitators of transition in SCD can help us better prepare AYA for transition. The specifics both groups identified as helpful will guide intervention development.",
