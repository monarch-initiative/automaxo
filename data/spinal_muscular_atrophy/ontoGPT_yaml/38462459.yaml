input_text: 'Viral Vectors in Gene Replacement Therapy. Throughout the years, several
  hundred million people with rare genetic disorders have been receiving only symptom
  management therapy. However, research and development efforts worldwide have led
  to the development of long-lasting, highly efficient, and safe gene therapy for
  a wide range of hereditary diseases. Improved viral vectors are now able to evade
  the preexisting immunity and more efficiently target and transduce therapeutically
  relevant cells, ensuring genome maintenance and expression of transgenes at the
  relevant levels. Hematological, ophthalmological, neurodegenerative, and metabolic
  therapeutic areas have witnessed successful treatment of hemophilia and muscular
  dystrophy, restoration of immune system in children with immunodeficiencies, and
  restoration of vision. This review focuses on three leading vector platforms of
  the past two decades: adeno-associated viruses (AAVs), adenoviruses (AdVs), and
  lentiviruses (LVs). Special attention is given to successful preclinical and clinical
  studies that have led to the approval of gene therapies: six AAV-based (Glybera  for
  lipoprotein lipase deficiency, Luxturna  for retinal dystrophy, Zolgensma  for spinal
  muscular atrophy, Upstaza  for AADC, Roctavian  for hemophilia A, and Hemgenix  for
  hemophilia B) and three LV-based (Libmeldy  for infantile metachromatic leukodystrophy,
  Zynteglo  for beta-thalassemia, and Skysona  for ALD). The review also discusses
  the problems that arise in the development of gene therapy treatments, which, nevertheless,
  do not overshadow the successes of already developed gene therapies and the hope
  these treatments give to long-suffering patients and their families.'
