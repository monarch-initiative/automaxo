input_text: An interpretable data-driven prediction model to anticipate scoliosis
  in spinal muscular atrophy in the era of (gene-) therapies. 5q-spinal muscular atrophy
  (SMA) is a neuromuscular disorder (NMD) that has become one of the first 5% treatable
  rare diseases. The efficacy of new SMA therapies is creating a dynamic SMA patient
  landscape, where disease progression and scoliosis development play a central role,
  however, remain difficult to anticipate. New approaches to anticipate disease progression
  and associated sequelae will be needed to continuously provide these patients the
  best standard of care. Here we developed an interpretable machine learning (ML)
  model that can function as an assistive tool in the anticipation of SMA-associated
  scoliosis based on disease progression markers. We collected longitudinal data from
  86 genetically confirmed SMA patients. We selected six features routinely assessed
  over time to train a random forest classifier. The model achieved a mean accuracy
  of 0.77 (SD 0.2) and an average ROC AUC of 0.85 (SD 0.17). For class 1 'scoliosis'
  the average precision was 0.84 (SD 0.11), recall 0.89 (SD 0.22), F1-score of 0.85
  (SD 0.17), respectively. Our trained model could predict scoliosis using selected
  disease progression markers and was consistent with the radiological measurements.
  During post validation, the model could predict scoliosis in patients who were unseen
  during training. We also demonstrate that rare disease data sets can be wrangled
  to build predictive ML models. Interpretable ML models can function as assistive
  tools in a changing disease landscape and have the potential to democratize expertise
  that is otherwise clustered at specialized centers.
