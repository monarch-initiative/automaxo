input_text: Efficient systemic CNS delivery of a therapeutic antisense oligonucleotide
  with a blood-brain barrier-penetrating ApoE-derived peptide. Antisense oligonucleotide
  (ASO) has emerged as a promising therapeutic approach for treating central nervous
  system (CNS) disorders by modulating gene expression with high selectivity and specificity.
  However, the poor permeability of ASO across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) diminishes
  its therapeutic success. Here, we designed and synthesized a series of BBB-penetrating
  peptides (BPP) derived from either the receptor-binding domain of apolipoprotein
  E (ApoE) or a transferrin receptor-binding peptide (THR). The BPPs were conjugated
  to phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMO) that are chemically analogous to
  the 2'-O-(2-methoxyethyl) (MOE)-modified ASO approved by the FDA for treating spinal
  muscular atrophy (SMA). The BPP-PMO conjugates significantly increased the level
  of full-length SMN2 in the patient-derived SMA fibroblasts in a concentration-dependent
  manner with minimal to no toxicity. Furthermore, the systemic administration of
  the most potent BPP-PMO conjugates significantly increased the expression of full-length
  SMN2 in the brain and spinal cord of SMN2 transgenic adult mice. Notably, BPP8-PMO
  conjugate showed a 1.25-fold increase in the expression of full-length functional
  SMN2 in the brain. Fluorescence imaging studies confirmed that 78% of the fluorescently
  (Cy7)-labelled BPP8-PMO reached brain parenchyma, with 11% uptake in neuronal cells.
  Additionally, the BPP-PMO conjugates containing retro-inverso (RI) D-BPPs were found
  to possess extended half-lives compared to their L-counterparts, indicating increased
  stability against protease degradation while preserving the bioactivity. This delivery
  platform based on BPP enhances the CNS bioavailability of PMO targeting the SMN2
  gene, paving the way for the development of systemically administered neurotherapeutics
  for CNS disorders.
