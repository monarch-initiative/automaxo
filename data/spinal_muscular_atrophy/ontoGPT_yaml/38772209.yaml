input_text: 'Cognitive function in SMA patients with 2 or 3 SMN2 copies treated with
  SMN-modifying or gene addition therapy during the first year of life. BACKGROUND:
  Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neuromuscular disease, causing progressive muscle
  weakness due to loss of lower motoneurons. Since 2017, three therapies, two modifying
  gene transcription and one adding the defective gene, have been approved with comparable
  efficacy on motor outcome. Data on cognitive outcomes of treated SMA type 1 patients
  is limited. The aim of this study was to evaluate cognitive function in symptomatic
  and presymptomatic SMA type 1 patients with two or three SMN2 copies who received
  SMN-modifying or gene-addition therapy in the first year of life. METHODS: Cognitive
  testing was performed in 20 patients, including 19 symptomatic SMA type 1 patients
  with up to three SMN2 copies and 1 pre-symptomatically treated patient. Children
  were tested using Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID-III) at the age of 2
  or 3 years or the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPSII-IV)
  at the of age of 5 years. RESULTS: 11/20 patients showed subnormal cognitive development.
  Boys had significantly lower cognitive scores. Patients requiring assisted ventilation
  or feeding support were more likely to have cognitive deficits. Achieving more motor
  milestones was associated with a better cognitive outcome. CONCLUSION: Treated patients
  with SMA type 1 have heterogeneous cognitive function with 55 % of patients showing
  deficits. Risk factors for cognitive impairment in our cohort were male gender and
  need for assisted ventilation or feeding support. Therefore, cognitive assessment
  should be included in the standard of care to allow early identification of deficits
  and potential therapeutic interventions.'
