input_text: 'Liver SMN restoration rescues the Smn2B/- mouse model of spinal muscular
  atrophy. BACKGROUND: The liver is a key metabolic organ, acting as a hub to metabolically
  connect various tissues. Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neuromuscular disorder
  whereby patients have an increased susceptibility to developing dyslipidaemia and
  liver steatosis. It remains unknown whether fatty liver is due to an intrinsic or
  extrinsic impact of survival motor neuron (SMN) protein depletion. METHODS: Using
  an adeno-associated viral vector with a liver specific promoter (albumin), we restored
  SMN protein levels in the liver alone in Smn2B/- mice, a model of SMA. Experiments
  assessed central and peripheral impacts using immunoblot, immunohistochemistry,
  and electron microscopy techniques. FINDINGS: We demonstrate that AAV9-albumin-SMN
  successfully expresses SMN protein in the liver with no detectable expression in
  the spinal cord or muscle in Smn2B/- mice. Liver intrinsic rescue of SMN protein
  was sufficient to increase survival of Smn2B/- mice. Fatty liver was ameliorated
  while key markers of liver function were also restored to normal levels. Certain
  peripheral pathologies were rescued including muscle size and pancreatic cell imbalance.
  Only a partial CNS recovery was seen using a liver therapeutic strategy alone. INTERPRETATION:
  The fatty liver phenotype is a direct impact of liver intrinsic SMN protein loss.
  Correction of SMN protein levels in liver is enough to restore some aspects of disease
  in SMA. We conclude that the liver is an important contributor to whole-body pathology
  in Smn2B/- mice. FUNDING: This work was funded by Muscular Dystrophy Association
