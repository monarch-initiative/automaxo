input_text: Fluoroscopic guidance for intrathecal delivery of nusinersen in pediatric
  patients with spinal muscular atrophy and complex spines. The introduction of nusinersen
  revolutionized the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). However, nusinersen
  is administered by interlaminar intrathecal injection which is challenging in patients
  with severe scoliosis, a common comorbidity of advanced SMA. This study evaluated
  the technical benefits of fluoroscopic guidance of intrathecal nusinersen administration
  in complex SMA patients with or without a fixation device. The cohort included 12
  patients aged 10-20 years (total 124 injections). The total success rate was 99
  %, with failure to complete only one out of 124 procedures. Demographic characteristics
  were diverse. Mean age at first injection was 14.2 years. Mean duration of radiation
  exposure was 77 s; mean dose area product was 2.32 Gycm2; and mean cumulative air
  kerma was 20.91mGy. Adverse events included post-dural-puncture headache (4.8 %
  of procedures), mostly mild and self-limited, and one allergic reaction. Treatment
  was discontinued in 2 patients because of difficult intrathecal access, and in 2
  for reasons unrelated to the injection technique. Fluoroscopy-guided nusinersen
  administration is a feasible option for patients with SMA and complex access. Success
  depends on proper patient positioning and expertise of the interventional radiologist.
  Radiation exposure is lower than with other techniques. Larger prospective studies
  are needed to confirm these findings.
