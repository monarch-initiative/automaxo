input_text: 'Challenges and opportunities in spinal muscular atrophy therapeutics.
  Spinal muscular atrophy was the most common inherited cause of infant death until
  2016, when three therapies became available: the antisense oligonucleotide nusinersen,
  gene replacement therapy with onasemnogene abeparvovec, and the small-molecule splicing
  modifier risdiplam. These drugs compensate for deficient survival motor neuron protein
  and have improved lifespan and quality of life in infants and children with spinal
  muscular atrophy. Given the lifelong implications of these innovative therapies,
  ways to detect and manage treatment-modified disease characteristics are needed.
  All three drugs are more effective when given before development of symptoms, or
  as early as possible in individuals who have already developed symptoms. Early subtle
  symptoms might be missed, and disease onset might occur in utero in severe spinal
  muscular atrophy subtypes; in some countries, newborn screening is allowing diagnosis
  soon after birth and early treatment. Adults with spinal muscular atrophy report
  stabilisation of disease and less fatigue with treatment. These subjective benefits
  need to be weighed against the high costs of the drugs to patients and health-care
  systems. Clinical consensus is required on therapeutic windows and on outcome measures
  and biomarkers that can be used to monitor drug benefit, toxicity, and treatment-modified
  disease characteristics.'
