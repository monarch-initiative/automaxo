input_text: 'Targeting STMN2 for neuroprotection and neuromuscular recovery in Spinal
  Muscular Atrophy: evidence from in vitro and in vivo SMA models. The development
  of ground-breaking Survival Motor Neuron (SMN) replacement strategies has revolutionized
  the field of Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) research. However, the limitations of
  these therapies have now become evident, highlighting the need for the development
  of complementary targets beyond SMN replacement. To address these challenges, here
  we explored, in in vitro and in vivo disease models, Stathmin-2 (STMN2), a neuronal
  microtubule regulator implicated in neurodegenerative diseases like Amyotrophic
  Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), as a novel SMN-independent target for SMA therapy. Our
  findings revealed that STMN2 overexpression effectively restored axonal growth and
  outgrowth defects in induced pluripotent stem cell-(iPSC)-derived motor neurons
  (MNs) from SMA patients. Intracerebroventricular administration of adeno-associated
  virus serotype 9 (AAV9) carrying Stmn2 cDNA significantly ameliorated survival rates,
  motor functions, muscular and neuromuscular junction pathological features in SMA
  mice, mirrored by in vitro outcomes. Overall, this pioneering study not only provides
  insight into the therapeutic potential of STMN2 in SMA, but also suggests its broader
  applications for MN diseases, marking a substantial step forward in addressing the
  multifaceted challenges of neurological diseases treatment.'
