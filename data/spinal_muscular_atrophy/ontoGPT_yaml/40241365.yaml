input_text: "[Nusinersen combined with risdiplam for the treatment of spinal muscular
  atrophy: a case series of 10 patients and literature review]. OBJECTIVES: To explore
  the efficacy and adverse reactions of nusinersen combined with risdiplam in the
  treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). METHODS: A retrospective analysis was
  conducted on the clinical data of 10 pediatric SMA patients treated with nusinersen
  combined with risdiplam at the Children's Medical Center of Xiangya Hospital, Central
  South University. RESULTS: Among the 10 SMA patients, there were 4 with type I,
  4 with type II, and 2 with type III. Nine patients initially received nusinersen
  monotherapy, while 1 patient received nusinersen combined with risdiplam. The median
  duration of combination therapy with nusinersen and risdiplam for the 10 patients
  was 10.5 months (range: 0.5-20.0 months), with 6 patients undergoing combination
  therapy for more than 6 months, showing improvements in motor and/or respiratory
  function. The remaining 4 patients had combination treatment durations of 0.5, 1.0,
  1.3, and 4.0 months, respectively, with no significant overall improvement. After
  combined treatment, 5 patients experienced skin hyperpigmentation, 2 had lumbar
  puncture site pain, 1 experienced vomiting, 1 had increased sputum production, and
  1 had reduced total sleep time. All adverse reactions were mild and did not require
  medical intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Nusinersen combined with risdiplam demonstrates
  efficacy in the treatment of SMA, and no significant adverse reactions have been
  observed."
