input_text: 'Taking the knife to neurodegeneration: a review of surgical gene therapy
  delivery to the CNS. Gene supplementation and editing for neurodegenerative disorders
  has emerged in recent years as the understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying
  several neurodegenerative disorders increases. The most common medium to deliver
  genetic material to cells is via viral vectors; and with respect to the central
  nervous system, adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors are a popular choice. The most
  successful example of AAV-based gene therapy for neurodegenerative disorders is
  Zolgensma  which is a transformative intravenous therapy given to babies with spinal
  muscular atrophy. However, the field has stalled in achieving safe drug delivery
  to the central nervous system in adults for which treatments for disorders such
  as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis are desperately needed. Surgical gene therapy delivery
  has been proposed as a potential solution to this problem. While the field of the
  so-called regenerative neurosurgery has yielded pre-clinical optimism, several challenges
  have emerged. This review seeks to explore the field of regenerative neurosurgery
  with respect to AAV-based gene therapy for neurodegenerative diseases, its progress
  so far and the challenges that need to be overcome.'
