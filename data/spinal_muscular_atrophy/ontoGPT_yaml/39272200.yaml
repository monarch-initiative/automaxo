input_text: 'Real-world multidisciplinary outcomes of onasemnogene abeparvovec monotherapy
  in patients with spinal muscular atrophy type 1: experience of the French cohort
  in the first three years of treatment. BACKGROUND: Spinal muscular atrophy type
  1 (SMA1) is the most severe and early form of SMA, a genetic disease with motor
  neuron degeneration. Onasemnogene abeparvovec gene transfer therapy (GT) has changed
  the natural history of SMA1, but real-world data are scarce. METHODS: A French national
  expert committee identified 95 newly diagnosed treatment-naive SMA1 patients between
  June 2019 and June 2022. We prospectively report on children treated with GT as
  the first and only therapy who had more than one-year of follow-up. RESULTS: Forty-six
  SMA1 patients received GT. Twelve patients received other treatments. Patients with
  respiratory insufficiency were oriented toward palliative care after discussion
  with families. Twenty-nine of the treated patients with more than 12 months of follow-up
  were included in the follow-up analysis. Among them, 17 had 24 months of follow-up.
  The mean age at treatment was 7.5 (2.1-12.5) months. Twenty-two patients had two
  SMN2 copies, and seven had three copies. One infant died in the month following
  GT due to severe thrombotic microangiopathy, and another died due to respiratory
  distress. Among the 17 patients with 24 months of follow-up, 90% required spinal
  bracing (15/17), three patients required nocturnal noninvasive ventilation, and
  two needed gastrostomy. Concerning motor milestones at the 24-month follow-up, all
  patients held their head, 15/17 sat for 30 s unassisted, and 12/17 stood with aid.
  Motor scores (CHOPINTEND and HINE-2) and thoracic circumference significantly improved
  in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows favorable motor outcomes and preserved
  respiratory and feeding functions in treatment-naive SMA1 infants treated by GT
  as the first and only therapy before respiratory and bulbar dysfunctions occurred.
  Nevertheless, almost all patients developed spinal deformities.'
