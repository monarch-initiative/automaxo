input_text: Integrated Approaches and Practical Recommendations in Patient Care Identified
  with 5q Spinal Muscular Atrophy through Newborn Screening. In recent years, significant
  progress has been made in 5q Spinal Muscular Atrophy therapeutics, emphasizing the
  importance of early diagnosis and intervention for better clinical outcomes. Characterized
  by spinal cord motor neuron degeneration, 5q-SMA leads to muscle weakness, swallowing
  difficulties, respiratory insufficiency, and skeletal deformities. Recognizing the
  pre-symptomatic phases supported by screening and confirmatory genetic tests is
  crucial for early diagnosis. This work addresses key considerations in implementing
  5q-SMA screening within the Brazilian National Newborn Screening Program and explores
  Brazil's unique challenges and opportunities, including genetic tests, time-to-patient
  referral to specialized centers, program follow-up, and treatment algorithms. We
  aim to guide healthcare professionals and policymakers, facilitating global discussions,
  including Latin American countries, and knowledge-sharing on this critical subject
  to improve the care for newborns identified with 5q SMA.
