input_text: Repeated AAV9 Titer Determination in a Presymptomatic SMA Patient with
  Three SMN2 Gene Copies - A Case Report. Adeno-associated viruses (AAV) are well-suited
  to serve as gene transfer vectors. Onasemnogene abeparvovec uses AAV9 as virus vector.
  Previous exposure to wild-type AAVs or placental transfer of maternal AAV antibodies,
  however, can trigger an immune response to the vector virus which may limit the
  therapeutic effectiveness of gene transfer and impact safety. We present the case
  of a female patient with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and three survival motor
  neuron 2 (SMN2) gene copies. The infant had elevated titers of AAV9 antibodies at
  diagnosis at 9 days of age. Being presymptomatic at diagnosis, it was decided to
  retest the patient's AAV9 antibody titer at two-weekly intervals. Six weeks after
  initial diagnosis, a titer of 1:12.5 allowed treatment with onasemnogene abeparvovec.
  The presented case demonstrates that, provided the number of SMN2 gene copies and
  the absence of symptoms allow, onasemnogene abeparvovec therapy is feasible in patients
  with initially exclusionary AAV9 antibody titers of >1:50.
