input_text: 'Observational analysis of the immunogenicity and safety of various types
  of spinal muscular atrophy vaccines. BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the
  immunogenicity and safety of different types of poliovirus vaccines. METHODS: A
  randomized, blinded, single-center, parallel-controlled design was employed, and
  360 infants aged >= 2 months were selected as study subjects. They were randomly
  assigned to bOPV group (oral Sabin vaccine) and sIPV group (Sabin strain inactivated
  polio vaccine), with 180 infants in each group. Adverse reaction events in the vaccinated
  subjects were recorded. The micro-neutralization test using cell culture was conducted
  to determine the geometric mean titer (GMT) of neutralizing antibodies against poliovirus
  types I, II, and III in different groups, and the seroconversion rates were calculated.
  RESULTS: Both groups exhibited a 100% seropositivity rate after booster immunization.
  The titers of neutralizing antibodies for the three types were predominantly distributed
  within the range of 1:128 to 1:512. The fold increase of type I antibodies differed
  markedly between the two groups (P < 0.05). Moreover, the fold increase of type
  II and type III antibodies for poliovirus differed slightly between the two groups
  (P > 0.05). The fourfold increase rate in sIPV group was drastically superior to
  that in bOPV group (P < 0.05). When comparing the post-immunization GMT levels of
  type I antibodies in individuals who completed the full course of spinal muscular
  atrophy vaccination, bOPV group showed greatly inferior levels to sIPV group (P
  < 0.05). For type II and type III antibodies, individuals in bOPV group demonstrated
  drastically superior post-immunization GMT levels to those in sIPV group (P < 0.05).
  The incidence of adverse reactions between the bOPV and sIPV groups differed slightly
  (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: These findings indicated that both the oral vaccine and
  inactivated vaccine had good safety and immunogenicity in infants aged >= 2 months.
  The sIPV group generated higher levels of neutralizing antibodies in serum, particularly
  evident in the post-immunization GMT levels for types II and III.'
