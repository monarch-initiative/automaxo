input_text: Clinical decision making around commercial use of gene and genetic therapies
  for spinal muscular atrophy. Spinal muscular atrophy is no longer a leading cause
  of inherited infant death in the United States. Since 2016, three genetic therapies
  have been approved for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy. Each therapy has
  been well studied with robust data for both safety and efficacy. However, there
  are no head-to-head comparator studies to inform clinical decision making. Thus,
  treatment selection, timing, and combination therapy is largely up to clinician
  preference and insurance policies. As the natural history of spinal muscular atrophy
  continues to change, more data is needed to assist in evidence-based and cost-effective
  clinical decision making.

  Split the following piece of text into fields in the following format:

  subject_extension: <A chemical or drug mentioned in the relationship between the medical action and the symptom, for example, "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  object_extension: <An optional term describing some specific aspect of the object, e.g. "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  subject: <The medical action. For example: blood transfusion, radiation therapy, cardiac catheterization, pulse oximetry, otoscopy>
  predicate: <The relationship type between the medical action and the symptom, usually TREATS or PREVENTS.>
  object: <A sign or symptom associated with the disease and targeted by the medical action. For example, Low serum calcitriol, hypoplasia of the thymus, chronic cough, aortic stiffness, low pulse pressure>
  qualifier: <The primary disease the relationship is about, or specifically the disease the symptom is related to. For example, Beck-Fahrner syndrome, hereditary retinoblastoma, progeria, diabetes mellitus, infectious otitis media>
  subject_qualifier: <An optional qualifier or modifier for the subject of the statement, e.g. "high dose" or "intravenously administered">
