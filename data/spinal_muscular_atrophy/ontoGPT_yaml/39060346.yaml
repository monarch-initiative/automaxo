input_text: Unveiling the adverse events of Nusinersen in spinal muscular atrophy
  management based on FAERS database. This study aims to collect and analyze adverse
  event (AE) reports related to Nusinersen from the FAERS database. The study employed
  a combination of signal quantification techniques, including the Reporting Odds
  Ratio (ROR), Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR), Bayesian Confidence Propagation
  Neural Network (BCPNN), and Multi-item Gamma Poisson Shrinker (MGPS), to enhance
  the accuracy of signal detection and reduce the risk of false positives or negatives.
  Between the first quarter of 2017 and the third quarter of 2023, the FAERS database
  collected a total of 11,485,105 drug AE reports, of which 5772 were related to Nusinersen.
  Through signal mining analysis, 218 preferred term (PT) signals involving 27 system
  organ classes (SOCs) were identified. The study discovered AEs related to metabolism
  and nutrition disorders, psychiatric disorders, and cardiac disorders SOCs, which
  were not mentioned in the product information. Additionally, complications directly
  related to the intrathecal administration of Nusinersen, such as increased CSF pressure,
  positive CSF red blood cell count, and AEs related to the method of drug use, such
  as neuromuscular scoliosis and cerebrospinal fluid reservoir placement, were highlighted.
  Notably, AEs related to renal function abnormalities, such as abnormal Urine protein/creatinine
  ratio and protein urine presence, showed higher frequency and signal strength. The
  findings of this study emphasize the importance of comprehensive safety monitoring
  in the clinical application of Nusinersen. These results are significant for guiding
  future clinical practices, improving disease management strategies, and developing
  safer treatment protocols.
