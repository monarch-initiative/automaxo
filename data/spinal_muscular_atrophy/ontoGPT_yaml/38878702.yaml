input_text: "2024 update: European consensus statement on gene therapy for spinal
  muscular atrophy. Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is one of the most common genetic
  diseases and was, until recently, a leading genetic cause of infant mortality. Three
  disease-modifying treatments have dramatically changed the disease trajectories
  and outcome for severely affected infants (SMA type 1), especially when initiated
  in the presymptomatic phase. One of these treatments is the adeno-associated viral
  vector 9 (AAV9) based gene therapy onasemnogene abeparvovec (Zolgensma ), which
  is delivered systemically and has been approved by the European Medicine Agency
  for SMA patients with up to three copies of the SMN2 gene or with the clinical presentation
  of SMA type 1. While this broad indication provides flexibility in patient selection,
  it also raises concerns about the risk-benefit ratio for patients with limited or
  no evidence supporting treatment. In 2020, we convened a European neuromuscular
  expert working group to support the rational use of onasemnogene abeparvovec, employing
  a modified Delphi methodology. After three years, we have assembled a similar yet
  larger group of European experts who assessed the emerging evidence of onasemnogene
  abeparvovec's role in treating older and heavier SMA patients, integrating insights
  from recent clinical trials and real-world evidence. This effort resulted in 12
  consensus statements, with strong consensus achieved on 9 and consensus on the remaining
  3, reflecting the evolving role of onasemnogene abeparvovec in treating SMA."
