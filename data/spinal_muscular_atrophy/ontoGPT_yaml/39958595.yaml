input_text: Triumphs, Trials, and Future Considerations in Genetic Therapies for Hereditary
  Neuromuscular Diseases. Neuromuscular diseases include conditions that affect the
  spinal motor neurons, peripheral nerves, neuromuscular junctions, and muscles, and
  they can result from acquired and inherited causes. The number of genetic therapies
  targeting the inherited causes of neuromuscular diseases has surged in the last
  decade. This review aims to highlight the current state of genetic therapies within
  the framework of precision medicine, focusing on the achievements and the gaps that
  remain. A major emphasis is on spinal muscular atrophy, Duchenne muscular dystrophy,
  and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, as these neuromuscular diseases have seen tremendous
  recent advancements. We will also discuss the future considerations necessary to
  accelerate the development of next-generation genetic therapies and enhance therapeutic
  outcomes for patients with neuromuscular diseases.
