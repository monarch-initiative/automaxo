input_text: "Ultrasound assisted versus landmark based intrathecal administration
  of nusinersen in adults with spinal muscular atrophy disease: A randomized trial.
  INTRODUCTION/AIMS: Nusinersen intrathecal administration can be challenging in spinal
  muscular atrophy (SMA) adults. We aimed to determine if the ultrasound (US)-assistance
  reduces the number of needle attempts and needle redirections needed for intrathecal
  drug administration and its impact on the procedure time, the incidence of adverse
  events (AEs), and patient satisfaction in these patients. METHODS: Fifty-eight patients
  aged 18 years and older scheduled for intrathecal nusinersen injection were enrolled
  and randomized (1:1 ratio) into Group 1 (nusinersen infusion with US-assisted technique)
  or Group 2 (nusinersen infusion with landmark-based technique). The number of attempts,
  number of redirections, periprocedural time, AEs and patient satisfaction were reported.
  Continuous variables were compared with the Student t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum
  test. Categorical variables were evaluated with the Chi-square test or Fisher's
  exact test in case of expected frequencies <5. The p-values <.05 were considered
  statistically significant. RESULTS: There were no statistical differences in the
  number of attempts, AEs, or patient satisfaction between the two groups. The number
  of needle redirections was significantly lower in the ultrasound group versus landmark-based
  group (p < .05) in both the overall group of patients and in the subgroup with difficult
  spines. The periprocedural time was about 40 seconds longer in US-group versus landmark-based
  group (p < .05). DISCUSSION: In SMA adults, US assistance reduces the number of
  needle redirections needed for intrathecal drug administration. These results suggest
  that the US assistance may be advantageous for nusinersen therapy to reduce the
  therapeutic burden of intrathecal infusion."
