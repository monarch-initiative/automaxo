input_text: "The Impact of Nusinersen and Risdiplam on Motor Function for Spinal Muscular
  Atrophy Type 2 and 3: A Meta-Analysis. Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a prevalent
  paediatric neuromuscular disorder characterised by muscle weakness and atrophy resulting
  from degeneration of spinal cord anterior horn alpha motor neurons. Gene therapy
  formulations exhibit varying benefits and limitations, driving the need for patient-friendly
  treatment options tailored to specific populations. The objective of this meta-analysis
  was to assess the effectiveness of gene therapy for motor function in children with
  SMA. The analysis encompassed a total of 719 participants from six randomised controlled
  trials (RCTs) conducted between 2017 and 2023. Among the studies, one demonstrated
  a significant and large standardised effect size (Cohen's d) favouring nusinersen
  in terms of Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale - Expanded (HFMSE) (d = 0.97) and
  revised upper limb module (RULM) (d = 0.96). Additionally, another study showed
  a moderate standardised effect size (Cohen's d) in favour of nusinersen concerning
  Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination-Section 2 (HINE-2) (d = 0.48). However,
  it is important to note that further research with a longer duration of observation
  is required to strengthen the evidence. Key Words: Spinal muscular atrophy, Nusinersen,
  Risdiplam, Motor function, Cohen's d."
