input_text: 'Drug-induced liver injury related to gene therapy: A new challenge to
  be managed. Gene therapy is being successfully developed for the treatment of several
  genetic disorders. Various methods of gene transfer have been developed to enable
  the production of the deficient enzyme or protein. One of the most important is
  adeno-associated virus vectors, which have been shown to be viable for use in in
  vivo gene therapy. Several gene therapies have already been approved. They are also
  promising for acquired diseases. Important examples include gene therapy for haemophilia
  A and B, X-linked myotubular myopathy, spinal muscular atrophy and several liver
  diseases such as Criggler-Najjar disease, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and Fabry
  disease. However, the introduction of a foreign compound into hepatocytes leads
  to hepatic reactions with heterogeneous phenotypic expression and a wide spectrum
  of severity, ranging from mild transaminase elevation to acute liver failure. Several
  mechanisms appear to be involved in liver injury, including an immune response,
  but also direct toxicity depending on the method of gene transfer. As a result,
  the incidence, expression and severity of liver injury vary from indication to indication
  and from patient to patient. Patients treated for haemophilia A are more prone to
  transaminase elevation than those treated for haemophilia B. Corticosteroids are
  successfully used to correct liver reactions but also to prevent degradation of
  the transferred gene and loss of therapeutic activity. The aim of this review is
  to describe the risk of liver injury according to the indication for gene therapy
  and the short- and long-term management currently proposed to prevent or correct
  liver reactions in clinical practice.'
