input_text: "Real-time measurement of radiation exposure in interventional radiologists
  during CT-guided intrathecal injections of nusinersen. PURPOSE: Some patients with
  spinal muscular atrophy and scoliosis require CT guidance during injections of nusinersen.
  The radiation applied to the operator in such procedures becomes an important issue
  in terms of staff health and safety. The aim of the study was to assess the operator's
  radiation exposure during CT-guided nusinersen injections in patients with spinal
  muscular atrophy and scoliosis. METHODS: Consecutive 40 CT-guided nusinersen injections
  were analyzed in terms of operator's radiation exposure measured in real time. RESULTS:
  The median radiation dose measured under the physician's lead apron and patient
  dose in terms of DLP was 0.20 microSv and 31.90 mGy*cm respectively. The radiation
  doses were significantly higher (p = 0.047) in patients with spinal instrumentation.
  CONCLUSION: The results show that CT-guided nusinersen injection is a relatively
  safe procedure in terms of operator's radiation exposure. This can allow for interventional
  radiologists to perform more procedures without exceeding their annual dose limit."
