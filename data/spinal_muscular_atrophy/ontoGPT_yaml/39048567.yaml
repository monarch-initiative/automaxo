input_text: Therapeutic strategy for spinal muscular atrophy by combining gene supplementation
  and genome editing. Defect in the SMN1 gene causes spinal muscular atrophy (SMA),
  which shows loss of motor neurons, muscle weakness and atrophy. While current treatment
  strategies, including small molecules or viral vectors, have shown promise in improving
  motor function and survival, achieving a definitive and long-term correction of
  SMA's endogenous mutations and phenotypes remains highly challenging. We have previously
  developed a CRISPR-Cas9 based homology-independent targeted integration (HITI) strategy,
  enabling unidirectional DNA knock-in in both dividing and non-dividing cells in
  vivo. In this study, we demonstrated its utility by correcting an SMA mutation in
  mice. When combined with Smn1 cDNA supplementation, it exhibited long-term therapeutic
  benefits in SMA mice. Our observations may provide new avenues for the long-term
  and efficient treatment of inherited diseases.
