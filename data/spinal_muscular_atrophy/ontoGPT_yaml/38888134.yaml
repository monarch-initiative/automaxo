input_text: "Impact of Spinal Surgery on Intrathecal Nusinersen Injections in Pediatric
  Spinal Muscular Atrophy. BACKGROUND: Complex spinal deformities necessitate surgical
  interventions that may intervene with intrathecal injections in patients with spinal
  muscular atrophy (SMA). This study aimed to determine the effect of spinal deformity
  correction surgery on nusinersen administration. METHODS: Pediatric patients with
  SMA, operated by a single surgeon, either via magnetically controlled growing rod
  (MCGR) or definitive fusion (DF) with skip instrumentation, were evaluated retrospectively
  in terms of safety and feasibility of intrathecal injections. Patients' and their
  parents' perspectives were evaluated through a questionnaire regarding any shift
  in the setting of injections. RESULTS: Fourteen patients with 15 spinal surgeries
  (10 MCGR and 5 DF) were included. Eleven patients received intrathecal treatment
  both before and after the surgery. Preoperative (n=3) and postoperative (n=9) fluoroscopic
  guidance was required leading to a shift in the application settings in 6 patients.
  Of 106 preoperative injections, 15% required fluoroscopy and 2% required anesthesia.
  Postoperatively, of 88 injections, 73% required fluoroscopy and 26% required anesthesia.
  No patients discontinued intrathecal injections due to technical difficulties associated
  with the spinal surgery. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that spinal surgery
  does not prevent safe and successful intrathecal nusinersen injections. In the DF
  group, the skip instrumentation technique provided access to interlaminal space
  for intrathecal injections. In either surgical group, no further auxillary approach
  was required. Modifications in the injection technique require an institutional
  approach, and concerns of patients and their families should be addressed accordingly.
