input_text: 'Impact of respiratory tract infections on spinal muscular atrophy with
  focus on respiratory syncytial virus infections: a single-centre cohort study. AIMS
  OF THE STUDY: Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a degenerative neuromuscular disorder
  leading to muscle hypotonia, weakness, and respiratory and bulbar impairment. Infants
  with SMA have an increased risk of respiratory tract infections (RTI) including
  severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections. Therefore, guidelines for the
  treatment of SMA recommend RSV prophylaxis with palivizumab for patients aged below
  two years who have compromised motor functions ("non-sitters"). Since palivizumab
  is not approved for RSV prophylaxis in SMA patients in Switzerland, payers usually
  do not grant cost approvals for this indication. Therefore, this study aimed to
  investigate the frequency of severe RTI among SMA patients focusing on RSV infections
  requiring hospital treatment and to determine the long-term impact of RSV infections
  on the natural history of SMA. METHODS: A single-centre cohort study at the tertiary
  paediatric Neuromuscular Centre Zurich, Switzerland, including data of SMA patients
  with a genetic-based therapy initiated below two years of age between May 2019 and
  December 2022. All hospitalisations were analysed with a focus on severe RTI and
  especially RSV infections, and their impact on nutritional and respiratory function.
  The costs of inpatient treatment of RSV infections were determined and compared
  with estimated expenses for RSV prophylaxis with palivizumab. RESULTS: 12 SMA patients
  (median age at treatment initiation: 3.5 months, range: 0-17 months) were followed
  for a cumulative period of 25.75 years (7 SMA type 1; 5 SMA type 2 including one
  presymptomatic individual). With an incidence rate of 2.34 per patient-year, the
  risk of severe RTI was especially high in SMA type 1 (versus 0.1 in SMA type 2,
  p = 0.044). A total of 37 hospitalisations (279 hospital days) was necessary for
  the treatment of RTI in general; 9 of them were attributed to RSV infections (in
  5 SMA type 1 patients; 84 hospital days). Only 3/12 SMA patients had received seasonal
  RSV prophylaxis with palivizumab. No RSV infections requiring hospital treatment
  occurred in patients while receiving seasonal RSV prophylaxis. During RTI, nutritional
  support had to be commonly initiated and continued after discharge. In 3/7 SMA type
  1 patients, non-invasive ventilation was started during acute treatment for RTI
  and continued to the end of follow-up. CONCLUSION: We observed a high risk of RTI,
  especially RSV infections, among young SMA patients. Failure to adhere to established
  care protocols, for example by omitting RSV prophylaxis, may be linked to a heightened
  risk of morbidity in these children.'
