input_text: "Experiences of families of children with spinal muscular atrophy and
  the healthcare professionals supporting them during the COVID-19 pandemic: A nationwide
  study. PURPOSE: This study aimed to explore how parents and grandparents of children
  with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) perceived how the COVID-19 pandemic affected
  their access to medication and physiotherapy. Further, healthcare professionals'
  experiences of the care of children with SMA during the pandemic were explored.
  METHODS: Thirty-nine parents and three grandmothers of 28 children with SMA answered
  a web-based survey at two time-points. Telephone follow-ups were conducted with
  seven of the parents. Parallel focus group interviews were conducted with three
  interdisciplinary teams of healthcare professionals. RESULTS: Results showed that
  21 family members, 12 children, and nine parents in the study tested positive for
  COVID-19 during the pandemic. None of the children became seriously ill. All respondents,
  however, indicated that the pandemic had a significant impact on their everyday
  life. It made socializing difficult for the children and reduced their access to
  physiotherapy, hydrotherapy, and personal care attendants. The pandemic also influenced
  the location of some nusinersen treatments. The professionals reported that, although
  much of their work continued as usual, they experienced increased stress from their
  role in nusinersen assessments. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that it may be
  valuable to find ways for healthcare professionals to support each other and to
  support their efforts to help severely ill children and their families now that
  healthcare systems have opened up again."
