input_text: 'Clinical Perspectives: Treating Spinal Muscular Atrophy. Spinal muscular
  atrophy is a rare and progressive neuromuscular disease that, without treatment,
  leads to progressive weakness and often death. A plethora of studies have led to
  the approval of three high-cost and effective treatments since 2016. These treatments,
  nusinersen, onasemnogene abeparvovec and risdiplam, have not been directly compared
  and have varying challenges in administration. In this review, we discuss the evidence
  supporting the use of these medications, the process of treatment selection, monitoring
  after treatment, the limited data comparing treatments, as well as future directions
  for investigation and therapy.'
