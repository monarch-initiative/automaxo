input_text: 'Safety analysis of laboratory parameters in paediatric patients with
  spinal muscular atrophy treated with nusinersen. BACKGROUND: Spinal muscular atrophy
  (SMA) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that can be treated with intrathecal
  nusinersen, an antisense oligonucleotide. In addition to efficacy, safety is a determining
  factor in the success of any therapy. Here, we aim to assess the safety of nusinersen
  therapy in paediatric patients with SMA. METHODS: Laboratory data of paediatric
  patients with SMA who received nusinersen between October 2019 and May 2022 were
  retrospectively analysed. RESULTS: During the observation period, 46 infants and
  children aged 2.9 months to 13.6 years received a total of 213 nusinersen doses
  without safety concerns. Inflammatory markers were stable throughout the study.
  International normalized ratio was increased by 0.09 per injection. Urea levels
  were increased by 0.108 mmol/L, and cystatin C decreased by 0.029 mg/L per injection.
  There were no significant changes in platelet count, activated partial thrombin
  time, creatinine levels or liver enzyme levels during treatment. The cerebrospinal
  fluid (CSF) leukocyte count remained stable, and total protein increased by 24.038
  mg/L per injection. CONCLUSION: Our data showed that nusinersen therapy is generally
  safe in children with SMA. Laboratory monitoring did not identify any persistent
  or significantly abnormal findings. CSF protein should be monitored to gain more
  insights.'
