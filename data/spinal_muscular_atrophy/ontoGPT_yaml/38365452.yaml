input_text: 'Invasive versus non-invasive paediatric home mechanical ventilation:
  review of the international evolution over the past 24 years. BACKGROUND: Home mechanical
  ventilation (HMV) is the treatment for chronic hypercapnic alveolar hypoventilation.
  The proportion and evolution of paediatric invasive (IMV) and non-invasive (NIV)
  HMV across the world is unknown, as well as the disorders and age of children using
  HMV. METHODS: Search of Medline/PubMed for publications of paediatric surveys on
  HMV from 2000 to 2023. RESULTS: Data from 32 international reports, representing
  8815 children (59% boys) using HMV, were analysed. A substantial number of children
  had neuromuscular disorders (NMD; 37%), followed by cardiorespiratory (Cardio-Resp;
  16%), central nervous system (CNS; 16%), upper airway (UA; 13%), other disorders
  (Others; 10%), central hypoventilation (4%), thoracic (3%) and genetic/congenital
  disorders (Gen/Cong; 1%). Mean age+-SD (range) at HMV initiation was 6.7+-3.7 (0.5-14.7)
  years. Age distribution was bimodal, with two peaks around 1-2 and 14-15 years.
  The number and proportion of children using NIV was significantly greater than that
  of children using IMV (n=6362 vs 2453, p=0.03; 72% vs 28%, p=0.048), with wide variations
  among countries, studies and disorders. NIV was used preferentially in the preponderance
  of children affected by UA, Gen/Cong, Thoracic, NMD and Cardio-Resp disorders. Children
  with NMD still receiving primary invasive HMV were mainly type I spinal muscular
  atrophy (SMA). Mean age+-SD at initiation of IMV and NIV was 3.3+-3.3 and 8.2+-4.4
  years (p<0.01), respectively. The rate of children receiving additional daytime
  HMV was higher with IMV as compared with NIV (69% vs 10%, p<0.001). The evolution
  of paediatric HMV over the last two decades consists of a growing number of children
  using HMV, in parallel to an increasing use of NIV in recent years (2020-2023).
  There is no clear trend in the profile of children over time (age at HMV). However,
  an increasing number of patients requiring HMV were observed in the Gen/Cong, CNS
  and Others groups. Finally, the estimated prevalence of paediatric HMV was calculated
  at 7.4/100 000 children. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with NMD represent the largest group
  of children using HMV. NIV is increasingly favoured in recent years, but IMV is
  still a prevalent intervention in young children, particularly in countries indicating
  less experience with NIV.'
