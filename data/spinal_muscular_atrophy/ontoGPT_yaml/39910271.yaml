input_text: "First-in-human study of epidural spinal cord stimulation in individuals
  with spinal muscular atrophy. Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an inherited neurodegenerative
  disease causing motoneuron dysfunction, muscle weakness, fatigue and early mortality.
  Three new therapies can slow disease progression, enabling people to survive albeit
  with lingering motor impairments. Indeed, weakness and fatigue are still among patients'
  main concerns. Here we show that epidural spinal cord stimulation (SCS) improved
  motoneuron function, thereby increasing strength, endurance and gait quality, in
  three adults with type 3 SMA. Preclinical works demonstrated that SMA motoneurons
  show low firing rates because of a loss of excitatory input from primary sensory
  afferents. In the present study, we hypothesized that correcting this loss with
  electrical stimulation of the sensory afferents could improve motoneuron function.
  To test this hypothesis, we implanted three adults with SMA with epidural electrodes
  over the lumbosacral spinal cord, targeting sensory axons of the legs. We delivered
  SCS for 4 weeks, 2 h per day during motor tasks. Our intervention led to improvements
  in strength (up to +180%), gait quality (mean step length: +40%) and endurance (mean
  change in 6-minute walk test: +26 m), paralleled by increased motoneuron firing
  rates. These changes persisted even when SCS was turned OFF. Notably, no adverse
  events related to the stimulation were reported. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:
  NCT05430113 ."
