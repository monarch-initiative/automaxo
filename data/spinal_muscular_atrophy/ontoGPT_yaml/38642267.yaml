input_text: 'Healthcare resource utilisation and direct medical cost for individuals
  with 5q spinal muscular atrophy in Sweden. BACKGROUND: Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA)
  is a rare, progressive, neuromuscular disorder. Recent advances in treatment require
  an updated assessment of burden to inform reimbursement decisions. OBJECTIVES: To
  quantify healthcare resource utilisation (HCRU) and cost of care for patients with
  SMA. METHODS: Cohort study of patients with SMA identified in the Swedish National
  Patient Registry (2007-2018), matched to a reference cohort grouped into four SMA
  types (1, 2, 3, unspecified adult onset [UAO]). HCRU included inpatient admissions,
  outpatient visits, procedures, and dispensed medications. Direct medical costs were
  estimated by multiplying HCRU by respective unit costs. Average annual HCRU and
  medical costs were modelled for SMA versus reference cohorts to estimate differences
  attributable to the disease (i.e., average treatment effect estimand). The trajectory
  of direct costs over time were assessed using synthetic cohorts. RESULTS: We identified
  290 SMA patients. Annualised HCRU was higher in SMA patients compared with reference
  cohorts. Highest risk ratios were observed for inpatient overnight stays for type
  1 (risk ratio [RR]: 29.2; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 16.0, 53.5) and type 2 (RR:
  23.3; 95% CI: 16.4,33.1). Mean annual direct medical costs per patient for each
  year since first diagnosis were greatest for type 1 ($114,185 and SMA-attributable:
  $113,380), type 2 ($61,876 and SMA-attributable: $61,237), type 3 ($45,518 and SMA-attributable:
  $44,556), and UAO ($4046 and SMA-attributable: $2098). Costs were greatest in the
  2-3 years after the first diagnosis for all types. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The
  economic burden attributable to SMA is significant. Further research is needed to
  understand the burden in other European countries and the impact of new treatments.'
