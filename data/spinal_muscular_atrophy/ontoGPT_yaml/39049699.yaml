input_text: 'Transverse interlaminar ultrasound-guided C1-C2 puncture for the intrathecal
  administration of nusinersen in patients with spinal muscular atrophy. INTRODUCTION/AIMS:
  Severe spinal deformities and previous spinal orthopedic instrumentation may result
  in substantial technical challenges for nusinersen delivery through lumbar puncture
  in patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). The aim of this paper was to review
  our experience with ultrasound-guided cervical puncture as an alternative approach
  for the intrathecal administration of nusinersen. METHODS: This was a retrospective
  medical record review of transverse interlaminar ultrasound-guided C1-C2 puncture
  for nusinersen delivery in SMA patients. The details of puncture, complications,
  and success rate of the procedure were summarized. RESULTS: There were four patients
  who received a total of 13 cervical punctures for nusinersen delivery. All procedures
  were technically successful with no major complications. Full doses of nusinersen
  were delivered intrathecally. DISCUSSION: Transverse interlaminar ultrasound-guided
  C1-C2 puncture is an alternative approach for administering nusinersen if lumbar
  puncture fails. The success of the technique requires a thorough preprocedural evaluation
  of cervical spine imaging, sound knowledge of the cervical sonoanatomy and careful
  manipulation of the needle.'
