input_text: 'Therapeutic Scoliosis-Specific Exercises for a Child With Spinal Muscular
  Atrophy: A Case Report. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to report on therapeutic
  scoliosis-specific exercises (PSSE) for a child with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA)
  who had spinal fusion. METHODS: PSSE were recommended after scoliosis was diagnosed
  and exercises focused on posture and improving strength preoperatively and restoring
  function postoperatively. RESULTS: Gross motor function remained stable before spinal
  fusion, briefly decreased after the procedure, and then stabilized post-surgery.
  Distance walked on the 6-minute walk test decreased post-surgery but improved after
  the addition of PSSE to the Standard of Care. CONCLUSIONS: Including PSSE as an
  adjunct to traditional interventions may be beneficial for children with SMA. Evidence
  supports incorporating PSSE to improve posture preoperatively in idiopathic scoliosis.
  Its use postoperatively and in children with SMA is not well studied. Controlled
  studies are needed to understand the impact of pre- and post-op PSSE in children
  with SMA.'
