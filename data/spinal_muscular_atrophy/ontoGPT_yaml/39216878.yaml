input_text: "Spinal muscular atrophy in an upper-middle-income nation before the advent
  of reimbursed disease-modifying therapies. OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the clinical
  characteristics and standard of care (SoC) of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) patients
  in Thailand, focusing on primary endpoints: age at death and a composite of death
  or tracheostomy need. DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. SETTING: Seven
  tertiary centres across Thailand. PATIENTS: Records of 110 patients with genetically
  confirmed SMA, spanning 2012-2021. INTERVENTIONS: Historical data review; no active
  interventions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Age at death and a composite measure of death
  or tracheostomy necessity. RESULTS: The cohort included 1 SMA0, 50 SMA1, 40 SMA2
  and 19 SMA3 cases. Median ages at the onset and diagnosis of SMA1 were 3 and 6.2
  months. Of SMA1 patients, 63% required ventilators, and eight received dimethyltryptamines
  (DMTs) at a median of 15 months (range 6.4-24.5 months). The median time from onset
  to DMT was 11 months (range 4.2-20.5 months). Among SMA1 patients, 73% died by the
  study's end. SMA2 and SMA3 patients' median onset ages were 11 and 24 months, respectively,
  with diagnosis at 24.8 and 68.7 months. Half of all types received physical therapy.
  CONCLUSIONS: Significant delays in diagnosis and SoC access, including DMTs, were
  observed, underscoring urgent needs for improved diagnostic and care strategies
  to enhance SMA patient outcomes in Thailand."
