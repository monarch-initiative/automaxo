input_text: 'Oximetry and carbon dioxide screening for ventilatory requirements in
  children with spinal muscular atrophy type 1-3. INTRODUCTION: Despite disease modifying
  treatments (DMT), assisted ventilation is commonly required in children with Spinal
  Muscular Atrophy (SMA). Guidelines suggest screening with oximetry and transcutaneous
  carbon dioxide (TcCO2) for sleep disordered breathing (SDB). AIM: To determine the
  utility of pulse oximetry and TcCO2 as a screen for SDB and the need for Non-Invasive
  Ventilation (NIV) in children with SMA type 1-3. METHODS: A prospective cohort study
  was conducted in Queensland, Australia. Full diagnostic PSG was completed in DMT
  naive children with SMA. Pulse oximetry and TcCO2 were extracted from PSG. Apnoea-hypopnoea
  indices (AHI) criteria were applied to PSG results to define the need for NIV. Abnormal
  was defined as: <=3 months of age [mo] AHI>=10 events/hour; >3mo AHI >=5 events/hour.
  Receiver operating characteristic curves were calculated for abnormal PSG and pulse
  oximetry/TcCO2 variables, and diagnostic statistics were calculated. RESULTS: Forty-seven
  untreated children with SMA were recruited (type 1 n = 13; 2 n = 21; 3 n = 13) ranging
  from 0.2 to 18.8 years old (median 4.9 years). Oxygen desaturation index >=4 % (ODI4)
  >=20events/hour had sensitivity 82.6 % (95 % CI 61.2-95.0) and specificity of 58.3
  % (95 % CI 36.6-77.9). TcCO2 alone and combinations of oximetry/TcCO2 had low diagnostic
  ability. The same methodology was applied to 36 children who were treated (type
  1 n = 7; type 2 n = 17; type n = 12) and oximetry+-TcCO2 had low diagnostic ability.
  CONCLUSION: ODI4 >=20events/hour can predict the need for NIV in untreated children
  with SMA. TcCO2 monitoring does not improve the PPV. If normal however, children
  may still require a diagnostic PSG. Neither oximetry nor TcCO2 monitoring were useful
  screening tests in the children treated with DMT.'
