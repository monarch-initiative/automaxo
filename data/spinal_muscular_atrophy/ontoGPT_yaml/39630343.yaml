input_text: 'Swallowing function in patients with spinal muscular atrophy before and
  after the introduction of new gene-based therapies: what has changed? OBJECTIVE:
  Individuals diagnosed with Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), particularly those presenting
  with the most severe phenotypes, have long contended with significant swallowing
  dysfunction. The recent emergence of efficacious advanced therapy has fundamentally
  altered the landscape of SMA management. By encompassing both the pre and post gene-based
  therapy eras within our analysis, we endeavour to elucidate the potential impact
  of these novel therapeutic interventions on this function. METHODS: Following the
  established methodology outlined by the Joanna Briggs Institute, a scoping review
  was conducted. This review encompassed relevant literature published up to March
  2024. Two electronic databases were searched, with additional studies identified
  by reviewing reference lists of pertinent articles. The search strategy employed
  a combination of keywords including "spinal muscular atrophy", "SMA", "swallowing",
  "feeding", and "nutrition". Articles were initially screened based on title and
  abstract, followed by a full-text review of eligible studies published in peer-reviewed
  English language journals. RESULTS: The initial database search resulted in 462
  articles, from which 23 studies were ultimately selected for analysis. Pre gene-based
  therapy studies revealed swallowing dysfunction as a prominent feature. Patients
  frequently reported challenges with chewing, choking on solids and liquids, and
  abnormal tongue movements during eating. Early dysphagia research relied on subjective
  measures (questionnaires, scales). objective measures like video fluoroscopic (VFSS)
  were rare. After gene-based therapies (GBTs), VFSS became the dominant, more objective
  method. Studies investigating the post-gene therapy era suggest potential clinical
  benefits, with trends towards improvement or stabilization of swallowing function.
  CONCLUSION: Pre gene-based therapy studies revealed widespread swallowing dysfunction
  in SMA. Conversely, the post-treatment era suggests potential improvement. Future
  research should prioritize identifying optimal therapies for individual swallowing
  function and develop validated assessments to optimize SMA management.'
