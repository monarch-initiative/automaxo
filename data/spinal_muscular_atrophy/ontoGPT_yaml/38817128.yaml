input_text: 'Preemptive dual therapy for children at risk for infantile-onset spinal
  muscular atrophy. OBJECTIVE: Compare efficacy of gene therapy alone (monotherapy)
  or in combination with an SMN2 augmentation agent (dual therapy) for treatment of
  children at risk for spinal muscular atrophy type 1. METHODS: Eighteen newborns
  with biallelic SMN1 deletions and two SMN2 copies were treated preemptively with
  monotherapy (n = 11) or dual therapy (n = 7) and followed for a median of 3 years.
  Primary outcomes were independent sitting and walking. Biomarkers were serial muscle
  ultrasonography (efficacy) and sensory action potentials (safety). RESULTS: Gene
  therapy was administered by 7-43 postnatal days; dual therapy with risdiplam (n
  = 6) or nusinersen (n = 1) was started by 15-39 days. Among 18 children enrolled,
  17 sat, 15 walked, and 44% had motor delay (i.e., delay or failure to achieve prespecified
  milestones). Those on dual therapy sat but did not walk at an earlier age. 91% of
  muscle ultrasounds conducted within 60 postnatal days were normal but by 3-61 months,
  94% showed echogenicity and/or fasciculation of at least one muscle group; these
  changes were indistinguishable between monotherapy and dual therapy cohorts. Five
  children with three SMN2 copies were treated with monotherapy in parallel: all sat
  and walked on time and had normal muscle sonograms at all time points. No child
  on dual therapy experienced treatment-associated adverse events. All 11 participants
  who completed sensory testing (including six on dual therapy) had intact sural sensory
  responses. INTERPRETATION: Preemptive dual therapy is well tolerated and may provide
  modest benefit for children at risk for severe spinal muscular atrophy but does
  not prevent widespread degenerative changes.'
