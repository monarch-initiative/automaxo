input_text: RNA therapeutics for treatment of diabetes. Diabetes is an ongoing global
  problem as it affects health of more than 537 million people around the world. Diabetes
  leaves many serious complications that affect patients and can cause death if not
  detected and treated promptly. Some of the complications of diabetes include impaired
  vascular system, increased risk of stroke, neurological diseases that cause pain
  and numbness, diseases related to the retina leading to blindness, and other complications
  affecting kidneys, heart failure, muscle weakness, muscle atrophy. All complications
  of diabetes seriously affect the health of patients. Recently, gene therapy has
  emerged as a viable treatment strategy for various diseases. DNA and RNA are among
  the target molecules that can change the structure and function of proteins and
  are effective methods of treating diseases, especially genetically inherited diseases.
  RNA therapeutics has attracted deep interest as it has been approved for application
  in the treatment of functional system disorders such as spinal muscular atrophy,
  and muscular dystrophy. In this review, we cover the types of RNA therapies considered
  for treatment of diabetes. In particular, we delve into the mechanism of action
  of RNA therapies for diabetes, and studies involving testing of these RNA therapies.
  Finally, we have highlighted the limitations of the current understanding in the
  mechanism of action of RNA therapies.
