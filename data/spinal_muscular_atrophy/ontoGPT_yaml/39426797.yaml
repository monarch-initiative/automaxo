input_text: "Clinicogenetic characterization and response to disease-modifying therapies
  in spinal muscular atrophy: real-world experience from a reference center in Southern
  Brazil. OBJECTIVE: Spinal Muscular Atrophy linked to chromosome 5q (SMA) is an autosomal
  recessive neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive proximal muscle
  atrophy and weakness. This study addresses the scarcity of research on novel disease-modifying
  therapies for SMA in Latin America by reporting a real-world experience in Southern
  Brazil. METHODOLOGY: This is a single-center historical cohort that included all
  patients diagnosed with spinal muscular atrophy at a Regional Reference Service
  for rare diseases. RESULTS: Eighty-one patients were included, of whom 7 died during
  follow-up. Of the remaining 74 patients, 5.4 % were classified as pre-symptomatic,
  24.3 % with SMA type 1, 28.4 % with type 2, 36.5 % with type 3, and 5.4 % with type
  4. The mean follow-up time ranged from 1.8 years for pre-symptomatic cases to 8.7
  years for SMA types 2 and 3. Approximately 42 % of these patients received specific
  disease-modifying therapy, of these, 96.8 % received Nusinersen, with 19.4 % transitioning
  to gene therapy using Onasemnogene Abeparvovec, and 6.4 % starting Risdiplam. Most
  patients with SMA type 1 were on disease-modifying treatment, whereas only slightly
  over a third of patients with type 2 and about 10 % of type 3 were receiving such
  treatments. Among treated patients, 80 % demonstrated improvement in motor performance
  during the follow-up, with a lesser therapeutic response being associated with late
  initiation of treatment and low motor function scores at baseline. CONCLUSION: This
  real-world study reinforces the effectiveness of disease-modifying therapies for
  SMA in Brazil within the context of low- and middle-income countries, which is greater
  the earlier and the better the patient's functional status."
