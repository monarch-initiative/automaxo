input_text: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation leads to biochemical and functional
  correction in two mouse models of acid ceramidase deficiency. Farber disease (FD)
  and spinal muscular atrophy with progressive myoclonic epilepsy (SMA-PME) are ultra-rare
  lysosomal storage disorders caused by deficient acid ceramidase (ACDase) activity.
  Although both conditions are caused by mutations in the ASAH1 gene, clinical presentations
  differ considerably. FD patients usually die in childhood while SMA-PME patients
  can live until adulthood. There is no treatment for FD or SMA-PME. Hematopoietic
  stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and gene therapy strategies for the treatment of
  ACDase deficiency are being investigated. We have previously generated and characterized
  mouse models of both FD and SMA-PME that recapitulate the symptoms described in
  patients. Here, we show that HSCT improves lifespan, behavior, hematopoietic system
  anomalies, plasma cytokine levels, and significantly reduces histiocytic infiltration
  and ceramide accumulation throughout the tissues investigated, including the CNS,
  in both models of ACDase deficient mice. HSCT was also successful in preventing
  lesion development and significant demyelination of the spinal cord seen in SMA-PME
  mice. Importantly, we note that only early and generally pre-symptomatic treatment
  was effective and kidney impairment was not improved in either model.
