input_text: "Improvement in functional motor scores in patients with non-ambulatory
  spinal muscle atrophy during Nusinersen treatment in South Korea: a single center
  study. We analyzed the changes in various motor function scores over a four-year
  period in patients with non-ambulatory spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) during Nusinersen
  treatment. Patients underwent Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (HINE)
  or Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE) before treatment, and approximately
  every 4 months thereafter. Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular
  Disorders (CHOP INTEND) or Children's Hospital of Philadelphia - Adult Test of Neuromuscular
  Disorders (CHOP ATEND), Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM), and Motor Function Measure
  (MFM) were performed based on baseline functional status. Narrative interviews were
  conducted to explore post-treatment physical improvement regarding activities of
  daily living (ADLs) and fatigue after ADLs. Based on HFMSE results, 9 patients achieved
  minimum clinically important differences. Average rates of change (slopes) with
  corresponding 95% confidence intervals for all assessment tools were in a positive
  direction. CHOP-INTEND showed the most prominent improvement in children and adolescents
  followed by HFMSE. Improvements in CHOP-ATEND were most noticeable in adults. Improvements
  were accompanied by changes in ADLs as observed in the narrative interviews. It
  is necessary to consider various functional aspects to determine the effectiveness
  of Nusinersen therapy. The objective assessment of the therapeutic effect of Nusinersen
  in non-ambulatory SMA requires consideration of functional aspects and the related
  ADLs."
