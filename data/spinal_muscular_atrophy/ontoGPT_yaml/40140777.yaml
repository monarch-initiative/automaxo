input_text: 'Administration practices of and adherence to nusinersen in children with
  spinal muscular atrophy: a multicenter disease registry study in China. BACKGROUND:
  Nusinersen was the first approved disease modifying therapy (DMT) for spinal muscular
  atrophy (SMA). Intrathecal administration of nusinersen enables drug delivery directly
  to the central nervous system, where the motor neurons are located. Per the package
  insert, individuals with SMA receive 4 loading doses of nusinersen followed by maintenance
  doses every 4 months thereafter. The aim of this analysis was to investigate the
  administration practices of and adherence to nusinersen in Chinese children with
  SMA. METHODS: Data were analyzed from a longitudinal, multicenter registry enrolling
  children with 5q-SMA in China. Information on nusinersen administration, including
  administration date, care setting, use of sedation and general anesthesia, method
  of administration, and use of imaging guidance before administration, was collected
  both retrospectively and prospectively. Adherence rate was calculated at dose and
  participant level. A dose was considered adherent if the inter-dose interval (for
  dose-level) and interval from the first dose (for participant-level) followed the
  standard dosing regimen, with a grace period of +- 7 days for Dose 2 to 4 and +-
  28 days thereafter. RESULTS: A total of 385 participants receiving nusinersen with
  a total of 2,415 doses were included in the study. The median (interquartile range)
  number of doses administered per participant was 6 (5-7). Over 99% of intrathecal
  injections were given in an inpatient setting. Only a few (n = 3, 0.1%) required
  general anesthesia, while 9% (n = 217) of doses were administered under the use
  of sedation. Interlaminar lumbar puncture (n = 2,407, 99.7%) was the most common
  method of administration, followed by cervical puncture (n = 5, 0.2%) and transforaminal
  lumbar puncture (n = 3, 0.1%). Over 90% of injections did not utilize any imaging
  guidance prior to administration, with ultrasound (n = 142, 5.9%) being the most
  commonly used imaging guidance. The adherence rate was 95.7% (1,943/2,030) at dose
  level and 81.0% (312/385) at participant level. The median inter-dose intervals
  aligned well with the dosing schedule, with 14 days for Doses 2 and 3, 35 days for
  Dose 4, and 114-124 days for maintenance doses thereafter. CONCLUSIONS: Findings
  from the analysis demonstrated high real-world adherence to nusinersen in Chinese
  children with SMA.'
