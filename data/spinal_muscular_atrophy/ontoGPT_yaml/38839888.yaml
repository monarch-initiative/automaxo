input_text: 'Gene replacement therapy for spinal muscular atrophy: safety and preliminary
  efficacy in a Brazilian cohort. Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a motor neuron
  disease associated with progressive muscle weakness, ventilatory failure, and reduced
  survival. Onasemnogene abeparvovec is the first gene replacement therapy (GT) approved
  to treat this condition. An observational retrospective study was conducted to assess
  adverse events and efficacy of GT in SMA patients. Forty-one patients with SMA (58.5%
  females and 80.1% SMA type 1) were included. The mean age at GT dosing was 18 (+-6.4)
  months. Thirty-six patients (87.8%) were under previous treatment with nusinersen,
  and 10 (24.4%) continued nusinersen after GT. Mean CHOP-INTEND increased 13 points
  after 6 months and this finding did not differ between groups according to nusinersen
  maintenance after GT (p = 0.949). Among SMA type 1 patients, 14 (46.6%) reached
  the ability to sit alone. Liver transaminases elevation at least two times higher
  than the upper limit of normal value occurred in 29 (70.7%) patients. Thrombocytopenia
  occurred in 13 (31.7%) patients, and one presented thrombotic microangiopathy. Older
  age (>2 years) was associated with more prolonged use of corticosteroids (p = 0.021).
  GT is effective in SMA patients, combined nusinersen after GT did not appear to
  add gain in motor function and older age is associated with prolonged corticosteroid
  use.'
