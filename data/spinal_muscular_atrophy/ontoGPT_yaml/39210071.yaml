input_text: "Prognostic factors for tube feeding in type I SMA patients treated with
  disease-modifying therapies: a cohort study. The aim of this study was to assess
  the need for tube feeding in a cohort of treated infants with type I SMA and to
  identify predictive factors. All patients were classified at baseline, when treatment
  started, and at follow-up according to their functional level and the need for tube
  feeding. Fisher's exact test was used to examine the associations between the outcome
  at the last follow-up and SMA type, SMN2 copy number, and baseline nutritional status.
  ANOVA was performed to compare CHOP INTEND scores and age at treatment initiation
  with outcomes. The cohort includes 75 type I SMA infants treated between 0.1 and
  5 years of age. At the last follow-up, 34 had no need for tube feeding, 9 had tube
  feeding but were also able to be fed by mouth, and 32 had tube feeding and were
  unable to be fed by mouth. Thirty of the 41 infants with tube feeding at follow-up
  already had feeding difficulties when treatment was started. The need for tube feeding
  at follow-up was associated with the level of feeding involvement at baseline and
  with CHOP INTEND scores [p < 0.001] but not with SMN2 copy number, SMA type 1 subtypes
  or age at treatment. The results of this study suggest that the need for tube feeding
  is not frequent in treated infants with type I SMA and, when occurring, can be predicted
  by the level of feeding involvement and low CHOP INTEND scores at baseline. What
  is Known:   The advent of disease-modifying therapies is increasingly changing the
  approach to swallowing and nutritional management in type I SMA.   Clinical trials
  and real-world data using all three disease-modifying therapies report a rather
  wide variability of feeding outcome and need for tube feeding that is often related
  to different cohorts that makes comparison between studies very difficult. What
  is New:   The real-world findings of this study, including all the children treated
  since treatments became available, confirmed that the need for tube feeding is not
  an invariable finding.   The level of feeding involvement at baseline appears to
  be a reliable prognostic indicator of bulbar outcome.   The results highlight the
  need for interventional studies with structured Speech and Language Therapist protocols
  that will help to better understand the extent to which bulbar function can be maintained
  or regained even in children requiring tube feeding."
