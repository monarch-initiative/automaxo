input_text: "Design, Development, and Functional Validation of a 3D-printed Passive
  Upper Limb Exoskeleton. Motor disability in children is evident in diagnoses such
  as cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis, or spinal muscular atrophy,
  among others, due to altered movement and postural patterns. This becomes more evident
  as the child grows and can be treated with physical therapy. The effectiveness of
  early interventions in facilitating an improvement in daily life activities varies
  depending on the child's condition. In this context, the use of exoskeletons has
  emerged in recent years as a valuable resource for conducting more efficient therapy
  processes. This work describes the design (both structural and functional) and preliminary
  usability and functional validation of a 3D-printed passive upper limb exoskeleton.
  The goal is to provide clinicians with an efficient, low-cost device that is both
  easy to manufacture and assemble and, in a gamified environment, serves as an assistive
  device to physical therapy. The device features 5 degrees of freedom, enabling both
  a pro-gravity and an anti-gravity mode, controlled by a series of elastic bands.
  This gives rise to a dual operating mode, offering assistance or resistance to different
  arm, forearm, and shoulder-dependent movements. Usability validation conducted by
  exoskeleton users showed average results in all aspects rated above 3.8 out of 5,
  which implies levels of satisfaction between \"quite satisfied\" and \"very satisfied\"\
  . The analysis of metrics recorded during therapy, such as the Hand Path Ratio and
  Success Rate (capturing user movements using an inertial sensor in the gamified
  environment), as well as the range of motion, reveals quantifiable improvements
  which can be attributed to the use of the exoskeleton: the Hand Path Ratio tended
  to approach 1 throughout sessions in almost all the users, the Success Rate remained
  stable (as users consistently were capable of completing the assigned tasks), and
  the range of motion showed that all patients achieved improvements of more than
  10 degrees in some of the tested movements). These functional validation processes
  involved the participation of 7 children with varying levels of upper limb neuro-motor
  impairments."
