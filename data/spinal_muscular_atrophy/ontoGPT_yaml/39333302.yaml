input_text: 'Onasemnogene Abeparvovec Gene Therapy and Risdiplam for the Treatment
  of Spinal Muscular Atrophy in Thailand: A Cost-Utility Analysis. OBJECTIVES: Caring
  for individuals with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a rare genetic disorder, poses
  tremendous challenges for the economy and healthcare system. This study evaluated
  the cost-utility of onasemnogene abeparvovec-xioi gene therapy and risdiplam for
  SMA in Thailand. METHODS: A Markov model was used to analyze the lifetime costs
  and outcomes of these treatments compared with standard of care for symptomatic
  SMA types 1 and 2-3. SMA type 1 patients were treated with one of either onasemnogene
  or risdiplam, while SMA types 2-3 patients received risdiplam. Data on disease progression
  and medical costs were sourced from hospital databases, while treatment efficacy
  was based on clinical trials. Interviews with patients and caregivers provided data
  on non-medical costs and utilities. Base case cost-effectiveness and sensitivity
  analyses were conducted, with the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) calculated
  in US dollars (USD) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained, against a willingness-to-pay
  threshold of 4444 USD/QALY gained. RESULTS: For SMA type 1, the ICERs for onasemnogene
  and risdiplam were 163,102 and 158,357 USD/QALY gained, respectively. For SMA types
  2-3, the ICER for risdiplam was 496,704 USD/QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: While onasemnogene
  and risdiplam exceeded the value-for-money threshold of the Thai healthcare system,
  they yielded the highest QALY gains among all approved medications. Policy-makers
  should incorporate various pieces of evidence alongside the cost-effectiveness results
  for rare diseases with costly drugs. Additionally, cost-effectiveness findings are
  useful for price negotiations and alternative financial funding, which allows policy-makers
  to seek solutions to ensure patient access, aligning with universal health coverage
  principles in Thailand.'
