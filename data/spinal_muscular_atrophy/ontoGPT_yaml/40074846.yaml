input_text: Considerations for repetitive intrathecal procedures in long-term nusinersen
  treatment for non-ambulatory spinal muscular atrophy. Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA)
  is a progressive neuromuscular disorder characterized by progressive motor function
  loss and skeletal muscular atrophy. Nusinersen, an antisense oligonucleotide, is
  the first FDA-approved therapy to achieve a significant milestone in SMA management.
  However, its high molecular weight requires intrathecal administration, posing challenges
  for clinical implementation. This study aimed to identify factors associated with
  postprocedural pain following repeated CT-guided transforaminal nusinersen injection
  in non-ambulatory patients with SMA. This single-center retrospective study evaluated
  34 patients who underwent a total of 290 procedures. Postprocedural pain occurred
  in 49.3% of cases. Factors influencing postprocedural pain included needle angle
  with vertical and horizontal lines, prophylactic pain control, and number of CT
  scans (p < 0.05). In patients experiencing postprocedural pain, the needle angle
  with vertical and horizontal lines emerged as significant variables, with a beta
  coefficient (standard error) of 0.034 (0.011) (p < 0.05). Needle angle was an important
  predictor of postprocedural pain.
