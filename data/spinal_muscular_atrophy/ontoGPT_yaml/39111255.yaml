input_text: Risk-benefit profile of onasemnogene abeparvovec in older and heavier
  children with spinal muscular atrophy type 1. Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an
  autosomal recessive disorder with progressive muscle atrophy and weakness, caused
  by biallelic mutations in the survival motor neuron 1 (SNM1) gene. Onasemnogene
  abeparvovec (OA) is an approved gene replacement therapy for patients with SMA.
  We report on two patients with SMA type 1, weighing 20 kg, previously treated with
  Nusinersen, who received OA infusion at 7 years of age. To our knowledge, these
  two patients are the heaviest treated in the real-world and we describe their different
  courses after gene therapy, including liver impairment requiring long-term steroid
  treatment and additional immunosuppression, with only transitory improvement in
  functional outcomes. Our cases illustrate how careful risk-benefit consideration
  is required in treating older and heavier SMA patients with OA, especially in view
  of the multiple treatment choices available for older patients with SMA.
