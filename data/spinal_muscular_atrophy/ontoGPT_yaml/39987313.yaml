input_text: Multiple respiratory assessment and thresholds for noninvasive ventilation
  in adult patients with spinal muscular atrophy. This study aimed to examine feasibility
  of inspiratory muscle strength tests, such as maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP)
  and sniff nasal inspiratory pressure (SNIP) in adult patients affected by spinal
  muscular atrophy (SMA), as well as their ability, along with forced vital capacity
  (FVC), to predict noninvasive ventilation (NIV) needs. Additionally, we evaluated
  feasibility and effectiveness of respiratory oscillometric measurements in the same
  patients. Twenty patients were retrospectively evaluated. NIV requirement was considered
  as peak nocturnal transcutaneous PCO2 > 49 mmHg, according to the cut-off used by
  Ward et al. MIP and SNIP were feasible in all patients. SNIP had significantly higher
  values (p < 0.001) and poorly agreed with MIP. ROC analysis revealed MIP as a weak
  predictor for NIV initiation (AUC = 0.57), while FVC (AUC 0.78, best cut-off 20%
  of predicted) and SNIP (AUC 0.84, best cut-off 61 cmH2O) were more effective. Oscillometry
  was performed in 11 patients. Reactance was abnormal in six of them and was significantly
  correlated with FVC (rho = 0.70, p = 0.01) and SNIP (rho = 0.72, p = 0.007), but
  not with MIP. In adult SMA patients, both MIP and SNIP are feasible, but SNIP is
  a better predictor of NIV needs, similar to FVC. Optimal predictive thresholds differed
  from those previously observed in neuromuscular disease. Oscillometric measurements
  may help to estimate FVC and SNIP in poorly collaborating patients.
