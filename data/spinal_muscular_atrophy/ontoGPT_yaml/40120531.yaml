input_text: "Assessing disease progression in spinal muscular atrophy, current gaps,
  and opportunities: a narrative review. Spinal Muscular Atrophy is a genetic disorder
  causing muscle atrophy and progressive weakness. People living with the condition
  can have a significant heterogenous phenotype ranging from arrest of motor development
  to mild impairment. Assessing disease severity has been done using a range of outcome
  measures that can be classified by body structure or function, by activities or
  by participation. Functional outocome measures can be generic measures, used to
  compare individuals or populations against general norms, or disease-specific measures
  designed to fit disease characteristics. Outcome measures assessing participation
  are primarily used to capture patients' perceptions of health-related quality of
  life, daily activity abilities, caregiver burden, and the impact of physical symptoms
  like fatigue or pain. When assessing disease progression, often the focus on functional
  abilities has served as an overall indicator of change. With the appearance of disease
  modifying therapies and the need to evaluate the impact that they had in the course
  of the disease, new requirements for the existing assessments measure had appeared.
  The current available toolkit is able to capture a significant spectrum of both,
  natural history and effect of new treatments but the increased survival, changes
  in fatigue, bulbar function and others will benefit from further assessment."
