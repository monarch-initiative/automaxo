input_text: 'Acceptability, validity and responsiveness of inertial measurement units
  for assessing motor recovery after gene therapy in infants with early onset spinal
  muscular atrophy: a prospective cohort study. BACKGROUND: Onasemnogene abeparvovec
  gene replacement therapy (GT) has changed the prognosis of patients with spinal
  muscular atrophy (SMA) with variable outcome regarding motor development in symptomatic
  patients. This pilot study evaluates acceptability, validity and clinical relevance
  of Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) to monitor spontaneous movement recovery in
  early onset SMA patients after GT. METHODS: Clinical assessments including CHOPINTEND
  score (the gold standard motor score for infants with SMA) and IMU measurements
  were performed before (M0) and repeatedly after GT. Inertial data was recorded during
  a 25-min spontaneous movement task, the child lying on the back, without (10 min)
  and with a playset (15 min) wearing IMUs. Two commonly used parameters, norm acceleration
  95th centile (  A  _95) and counts per minute (  A  _CPM) were computed for each
  wrist, elbow and foot sensors. RESULTS: 23 SMA-patients were included (mean age
  at diagnosis 8 months [min 2, max 20], 19 SMA type 1, three type 2 and one presymptomatic)
  and 104 IMU-measurements were performed, all well accepted by families and 84/104
  with a good child participation (evaluated with Brazelton scale).   A  _95 and   A  _CPM
  showed high internal consistency (without versus with a playset) with interclass
  correlation coefficient for the wrist sensors of 0.88 and 0.85 respectively and
  for the foot sensors of 0.93 and 0.91 respectively.   A  _95 and   A  _CPM were
  strongly correlated with CHOPINTEND (r for wrist sensors 0.74 and 0.67 respectively
  and for foot sensors 0.61 and 0.68 respectively, p-values < 0.001).   A  _95 for
  the foot, the wrist, the elbow sensors and   A  _CPM for the foot, the wrist, the
  elbow sensors increased significantly between baseline and the 12 months follow-up
  visit (respective p-values: 0.004, < 0.001, < 0.001, 0.006, < 0.001, < 0.001). CONCLUSION:
  IMUs were well accepted, consistent, concurrently valid, responsive and associated
  with unaided sitting acquisition especially for the elbow sensors. This study is
  the first reporting a large set of inertial sensor derived data after GT in SMA
  patients and paves the way for IMU-based follow-up of SMA patients after treatment.'
