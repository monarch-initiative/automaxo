input_text: 'Polysomnography findings and respiratory muscle function in infants with
  early onset spinal muscular atrophy after gene replacement as monotherapy: A prospective
  study. BACKGROUND: Gene replacement therapy (onasemnogene abeparvovec) is associated
  with an improvement of the prognosis of children with spinal muscular atrophy, but
  information on long-term respiratory outcome is scarce. The aim of this study was
  to report the polysomnography findings and respiratory muscle function of infants
  with treatment-naive spinal muscular atrophy type 1 and 2 up to 24 months after
  onasemnogene abeparvovec monotherapy. METHODS: A clinical and motor evaluation,
  respiratory muscle function testing, and polysomnography were performed repeatedly.
  RESULTS: Fifteen spinal muscular atrophy patients (1 presymptomatic, 7 type 1b,
  6 type 1c, and 1 type 2) were included at a median age of 8.6 months (range 3.8-12.6)
  and followed for 24 months. The thoracic over head circumference ratio was close
  to normal at baseline (median 1.00 (range 0.90-1.05)) and increased significantly
  over time. All polysomnography and nocturnal gas exchange parameters were within
  normal ranges at baseline (median apnea-hypopnea index 2.5 events/hour (range 0.4-5.3))
  and follow-up. The inspiratory muscle strength was normal at baseline but tended
  to slightly decrease over time and the expiratory muscle strength was low at any
  time especially for patients with recurrent respiratory infections (median (range)
  at baseline in cmH2O: crying esophageal pressure 54 (30-110), crying transdiaphragmatic
  pressure 65 (35-107), gastric pressure during maximal cough 26 (10-130), esophageal
  pressure during maximal cough 61 (38-150)). Only 3 patients required noninvasive
  ventilation. CONCLUSION: A continuous respiratory monitoring of spinal muscular
  atrophy patients during the first years of life following onasemnogene abeparvovec
  monotherapy seems recommended despite the normality of polysomnography parameters.'
