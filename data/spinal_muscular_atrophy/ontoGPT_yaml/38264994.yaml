input_text: Development of an Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Spot Assay for the Assessment
  of Adeno-Associated Virus Peptides to Examine Immune Safety. Adeno-associated virus
  (AAV)-based gene therapies have shown promise as novel treatments for rare genetic
  disorders such as hemophilia A and spinal muscular atrophy. However, cellular immune
  responses mediated by cytotoxic (CD8+) and helper (CD4+) T cells may target vector-transduced
  cells as well as healthy immune cells, impacting safety and efficacy. In this study,
  we describe the optimization and reproducibility of interferon-gamma (IFNgamma)-based
  and interleukin-2 (IL-2)-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISpot) assays
  for measuring T cell responses against AAV peptide antigens. For method optimization,
  peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from healthy human donors
  and stimulated with commercially available major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
  class I or II-specific peptides as positive controls. Peptide pools were designed
  from published AAV8 and AAV9 capsid protein sequences and then used to assess the
  presence of AAV-specific T cell responses. Our results demonstrate a measurable
  increase in IFNgamma and IL-2-producing cells after AAV peptide presentation. Furthermore,
  there was an observed difference in the magnitude and specificity of response to
  peptide pools based on AAV serotype and donor. Finally, using individual peptides,
  we identified a region of the AAV9 capsid protein that can elicit an immunogenic
  response. This work shows the applicability of ELISpot in assessing anti-AAV immune
  responses and provides insight into how novel recombinant AAV vectors could be designed
  to reduce immunogenic potential.
