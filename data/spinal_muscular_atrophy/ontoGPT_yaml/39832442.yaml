input_text: 'Difficulty of administration of nusinersen in complex-column spinal muscular
  atrophy: New alternative technique by means of cervical intrathecal access through
  an Ommaya reservoir. BACKGROUND: The study aimed to describe a new Ommaya reservoir
  implantation method in late-onset SMA patients, assessing its safety and effectiveness
  under standard clinical conditions. METHODS: Prospective observational study. Lumbar
  intrathecal access was unfeasible due to significant scoliosis and prior spinal
  surgeries with instrumentation. Patients were infused with Nusinersen through the
  Ommaya reservoir at Hospital Universitario La Paz (Spain) following the standard
  dosing protocol. RESULTS: The cohort was composed of 6 patients, 5 individuals with
  type 2 SMA (83.3 %), and 1 patient presenting with type 3 SMA. 4 of the patients
  were functionally sitters (66.7 %) and 2 had lost this ability prior to initiating
  treatment (non-sitters). Mean treatment was 34.7 months. Patient discharge was done
  in all the cases within 48 h post-admission; no significant postoperative complications
  or during administration of nusinersen were reported. Functional progress was observed
  in all patients. Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE) showed a low
  average increase (1.0), attributed to the severity of baseline functional impairments.
  Improvements in upper extremity motor function, measured by the Revised Upper Limb
  Module (RULM), were more pronounced, with an average improvement of 3.3. Disability
  levels as measured by the Egen Klassifikation 2 (EK2) scale, declined by 4.4. CONCLUSION:
  the current study broadens knowledge regarding the efficacy and safety of using
  an Ommaya reservoir to administer nusinersen in patients with SMA Types 2 and 3.
  The technique demonstrated rapid, straightforward drug delivery through a subcutaneous
  needle, maintaining optimal sterility without radiation or the need for a multidisciplinary
  team.'
