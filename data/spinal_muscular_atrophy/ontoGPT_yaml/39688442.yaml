input_text: 'Genetic study on candidates for oocyte donation. OBJECTIVE: There is
  a rising demand for assisted reproductive medicine, including sperm, oocyte and
  embryo donation. Besides medical and legal considerations, genetic testing, including
  carrier screening for multiple autosomal and X-linked recessive disorders plays
  an essential role in evaluating hereditary risk among donors and therefore exclude
  them from the donation process. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on
  oocyte donors from a private clinic of assisted reproduction who underwent genetic
  testing between June 2014 and September 2023. Pre and post-test procedures were
  performed at the private clinic while karyotyping and carrier screening for Cystic
  Fibrosis, Fragile X syndrome and Spinal Muscular Atrophy were performed at the Genetic
  Unit of Faculty of Medicine, University of Porto. RESULTS: Among 581 donors, 81
  women were excluded from the donation process since 5/563 had an alteration in karyotype,
  57/581 were carriers of a Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator pathogenic
  variant or had a 5T allele, 11/394 had Survival of Motor Neuron 1 deletion and 8/426
  had an intermediate or premutation allele in Fragile X Messenger Ribonucleoprotein
  gene. While recommendations from fertility societies advocate for comprehensive
  screening, opinions differ on the mandatory implementation of expanded carrier screening.
  CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the genetic tests and the pre and post-test counseling
  is imperative to optimize reproductive outcomes in the oocyte donation process.'
