input_text: 'Safety and Efficacy of Apitegromab in Patients With Spinal Muscular Atrophy
  Types 2 and 3: The Phase 2 TOPAZ Study. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Currently approved
  therapies for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) reverse the degenerative course, leading
  to better functional outcome, but they do not address the impairment arising from
  preexisting neurodegeneration. Apitegromab, an investigational, fully human monoclonal
  antibody, inhibits activation of myostatin (a negative regulator of skeletal muscle
  growth), thereby preserving muscle mass. The phase 2 TOPAZ trial assessed the safety
  and efficacy of apitegromab in individuals with later-onset type 2 and type 3 SMA.
  METHODS: In this study, designed to investigate potential meaningful combinations
  of eligibility and treatment regimen for future studies, participants aged 2-21
  years received IV apitegromab infusions every 4 weeks for 12 months in 1 of 3 cohorts.
  Cohort 1 stratified ambulatory participants aged 5-21 years into 2 arms (apitegromab
  20 mg/kg alone or in combination with nusinersen); cohort 2 evaluated apitegromab
  20 mg/kg combined with nusinersen in nonambulatory participants aged 5-21 years;
  and cohort 3 blindly evaluated 2 randomized apitegromab doses (2 and 20 mg/kg) combined
  with nusinersen in younger participants >=2 years of age. The primary efficacy measure
  was mean change from baseline using the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale version
  appropriate for each cohort. Data were analyzed using a paired t test with 2-sided
  5% type 1 error for the mean change from baseline for predefined cohort-specific
  primary efficacy end points. RESULTS: Fifty-eight participants (mean age 9.4 years)
  were enrolled at 16 trial sites in the United States and Europe. Participants had
  been treated with nusinersen for a mean of 25.9 months before enrollment in any
  of the 3 trial cohorts. At month 12, the mean change from baseline in Hammersmith
  scale score was -0.3 points (95% CI -2.1 to 1.4) in cohort 1 (n = 23), 0.6 points
  (-1.4 to 2.7) in cohort 2 (n = 15), and in cohort 3 (n = 20), the mean scores were
  5.3 (-1.5 to 12.2) and 7.1 (1.8 to 12.5) for the 2-mg/kg (n = 8) and 20-mg/kg (n
  = 9) arms, respectively. The 5 most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse
  events were headache (24.1%), pyrexia (22.4%), upper respiratory tract infection
  (22.4%), cough (22.4%), and nasopharyngitis (20.7%). No deaths or serious adverse
  reactions were reported. DISCUSSION: Apitegromab led to improved motor function
  in participants with later-onset types 2 and 3 SMA. These results support a randomized,
  placebo-controlled phase 3 trial of apitegromab in participants with SMA. TRIAL
  REGISTRATION INFORMATION: This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03921528).
  CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class III evidence that apitegromab
  improves motor function in later-onset types 2 and 3 spinal muscular atrophy.'
