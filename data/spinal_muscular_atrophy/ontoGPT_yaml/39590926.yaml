input_text: 'A Case Series Examining Clinic, Laboratory, and Physical Function After
  Administration of Nusinersen in Adults With Spinal Muscular Atrophy, a Single-Center
  Study. ABSTRACT: Spinal muscular atrophy is an incurable inherited disease caused
  by lower motor neuron death from mutations of the survival motor neuron genes. Intrathecal
  therapy with the antisense oligonucleotide, nusinersen, has been demonstrated to
  be beneficial in children with this disease, but the experience in adults, particularly
  ambulatory patients, is limited. We present a prospective observational case series
  from a single center using nusinersen therapy where we categorize 6 adult patients
  with spinal muscular atrophy into 2 functional categories: ambulatory (n = 3) or
  nonambulatory (n = 3). All received therapy that was administered intrathecally
  every 4 months. We monitored the course and laboratory data for 1 year and observed
  for side effects. There was no significant deterioration for 1 year. There was some
  minor improvement particularly in subjective changes. The benefit seems to decrease
  after 3 months. No significant complications were observed.'
