input_text: "Novel Gene Therapy Approaches for Targeting Neurodegenerative Disorders:
  Focusing on Delivering Neurotrophic Genes. Neurodegenerative illnesses (NDDs) like
  Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal muscular atrophy,
  and Huntington's disease have demonstrated considerable potential for gene therapy
  as a viable therapeutic intervention. NDDs are marked by the decline of neurons,
  resulting in changes in both behavior and pathology within the body. Strikingly,
  only symptomatic management is available without a cure for the NDDs. There is an
  unmet need for a permanent therapeutic approach. Many studies have been going on
  to target the newer therapeutic molecular targets for NDDs including gene-based
  therapy. Gene therapy has the potential to provide therapeutic benefits to a large
  number of patients with NDDs by offering mechanisms including neuroprotection, neuro-restoration,
  and rectification of pathogenic pathways. Gene therapy is a medical approach that
  aims to modify the biological characteristics of living cells by controlling the
  expression of specific genes in certain neurological disorders. Despite being the
  most complex and well-protected organ in the human body, there is clinical evidence
  to show that it is possible to specifically target the central nervous system (CNS).
  This provides hope for the prospective application of gene therapy in treating NDDs
  in the future. There are several advanced techniques available for using viral or
  non-viral vectors to deliver the therapeutic gene to the afflicted region. Neurotrophic
  factors (NTF) in the brain are crucial for the development, differentiation, and
  survival of neurons in the CNS, making them important in the context of various
  neurological illnesses. Gene delivery of NTF has the potential to be used as a therapeutic
  approach for the treatment of neurological problems in the brain. This review primarily
  focuses on the methodologies employed for delivering the genes of different NTFs
  to treat neurological disorders. These techniques are currently being explored as
  a viable therapeutic approach for neurodegenerative diseases. The article exclusively
  addresses gene delivery approaches and does not cover additional therapy strategies
  for NDDs. Gene therapy offers a promising alternative treatment for NDDs by stimulating
  neuronal growth instead of solely relying on symptom relief from drugs and their
  associated adverse effects. It can serve as a long-lasting and advantageous treatment
  choice for the management of NDDs. The likelihood of developing NDDs increases with
  age as a result of neuronal degradation in the brain. Gene therapy is an optimal
  approach for promoting neuronal growth through the introduction of nerve growth
  factor genes."
