input_text: 'An updated systematic review on spinal muscular atrophy patients treated
  with nusinersen, onasemnogene abeparvovec (at least 24 months), risdiplam (at least
  12 months) or combination therapies. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review provides
  an update on outcomes for patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type 1 to
  4 treated with approved therapeutics, including the most recent, risdiplam, for
  an observation period of up to 48 months. METHODS: A systematic literature search
  was conducted in July 2023 in four databases. Selected publications were assessed
  for internal validity and risk of bias by two authors and relevant data were extracted
  into standardised tables. Results were summarised narratively as substantial heterogeneity
  of studies prevents meaningful quantitative analysis. RESULTS: Twenty observational
  studies and one RCT were included in the analysis, fifteen studies on nusinersen,
  one on onasemnogene abeparvovec and two on risdiplam. Evidence supports the effectiveness
  of the therapies in motor function improvement for up to 48 months of follow-up
  in the SMA types specified in their respective indications. Better results were
  observed with earlier treatment initiation and higher baseline function. Whilst
  motor improvement was consistently observed, regardless of SMA type or treatment
  used, we noted no significant improvements in respiratory and nutritional outcomes.
  Quality of life endpoints were rarely investigated. Adverse events were common but
  seldom classified as treatment-related except for post-lumbar puncture syndrome,
  which was frequently reported across nusinersen studies. CONCLUSION: The treatment
  of SMA with the new therapies changes the disease phenotype with changes in motor
  function far exceeding any improvement in respiratory and nutritional function.
  Questions persist on long-term efficacy, potential regressions, impact on quality
  of life and social functioning, therapy duration, and discontinuation indicators.'
