input_text: "Immune responses to central nervous system directed adeno-associated
  virus gene therapy: Does direct CNS delivery make a difference? Adeno-associated
  virus (AAV) mediated gene therapy is a leading gene delivery platform with potential
  to transform the landscape of treatment for neurological disorders. While AAV is
  deemed non-immunogenic compared to other viral vectors, adverse immune reactions
  have been observed in the clinic, raising concerns. As the central nervous system
  (CNS) has a tightly regulated immune system, characterized by a degree of tolerance,
  it has been considered a unique target for AAV gene therapy. AAV vectors have shown
  promising results for the treatment of several CNS disorders including Spinal Muscular
  Atrophy, Giant Axonal Neuropathy, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Tay Sachs Disease,
  Parkinson's Disease, and others, demonstrating safety and success. The Food and
  Drug Administration (FDA) approval of Zolgensma and European Medicines Agency (EMA)
  approval of Upstaza, for Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) and Aromatic l-amino acid
  decarboxylase deficiency (AADC) respectively, represent this success, all while
  highlighting significant differences in immune responses to AAV, particularly with
  regards to therapeutic administration route. AAV therapies like Upstaza that are
  injected directly into the immune-specialized brain have been characterized by mild
  immune response profiles and minor adverse events, whereas therapies like Zolgensma
  that are injected systemically demonstrate more robust immune stimulation and off-target
  toxicities. Despite these contrasting parallels, these therapeutics and others in
  the clinic have demonstrated clinical benefit for patients, warranting further exploration
  of immune responses to CNS-directed AAV clinical trials. Thus, in this review, we
  discuss effects of different routes of AAV administration on eliciting local and
  peripheral immune responses specifically observed in CNS-targeted trials."
