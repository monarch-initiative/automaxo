input_text: Expansion of Splice-Switching Therapy with Antisense Oligonucleotides.
  Since 2016, splice-switching therapy, in which splicing is controlled by antisense
  oligonucleotides, has been applied in clinical practice for spinal muscular atrophy
  and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. In the former disease, this therapy induces exon
  inclusion, while, in the latter, it induces exon skipping, leading expression of
  functional proteins. Basic and clinical studies of splice-switching therapy for
  many monogenic diseases have now been conducted. The molecular mechanisms of splice-switching
  therapy include not only the induction of exon inclusion and skipping, but also
  the induction of pseudoexon skipping and suppression of splicing sites generated
  by mutations. In addition, therapies that alter protein function by regulating splicing
  are being investigated not only for monogenic diseases but also for non-monogenic
  ones such as cancer and immune-related disorders. It is expected that many of these
  basic studies will be translated into clinical applications. This review describes
  the current status of basic research and clinical applications of splice-switching
  therapy to promote the development of treatments for noncurable diseases.
