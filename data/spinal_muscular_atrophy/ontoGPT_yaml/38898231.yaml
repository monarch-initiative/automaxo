input_text: 'Gene therapy for CNS disorders: modalities, delivery and translational
  challenges. Gene therapy is emerging as a powerful tool to modulate abnormal gene
  expression, a hallmark of most CNS disorders. The transformative potentials of recently
  approved gene therapies for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), amyotrophic
  lateral sclerosis (ALS) and active cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy are encouraging
  further development of this approach. However, most attempts to translate gene therapy
  to the clinic have failed to make it to market. There is an urgent need not only
  to tailor the genes that are targeted to the pathology of interest but to also address
  delivery challenges and thereby maximize the utility of genetic tools. In this Review,
  we provide an overview of gene therapy modalities for CNS diseases, emphasizing
  the interconnectedness of different delivery strategies and routes of administration.
  Important gaps in understanding that could accelerate the clinical translatability
  of CNS genetic interventions are addressed, and we present lessons learned from
  failed clinical trials that may guide the future development of gene therapies for
  the treatment and management of CNS disorders.'
