input_text: 'A horizontal and perpendicular interlaminar approach for intrathecal
  nusinersen injection in patients with spinal muscular atrophy and scoliosis: an
  observational study. BACKGROUND: Lumbar puncture is challenging for patients with
  scoliosis. Previous ultrasound-assisted techniques for lumbar puncture used the
  angle of the probe as the needle trajectory; however, reproducing the angle is difficult
  and increases the number of needle manipulations. In response, we developed a technique
  that eliminated both the craniocaudal and lateromedial angulation of the needle
  trajectory to overall improve this technique. We assessed the feasibility and safety
  of this method in patients with scoliosis and identify factors related to difficult
  lumbar puncture. METHODS: Patients with spinal muscular atrophy and scoliosis who
  were referred to the anesthesia department for intrathecal nusinersen administrations
  were included. With a novel approach that utilized patient position and geometry,
  lumbar puncture was performed under ultrasound guidance. Success rates, performance
  times and adverse events were recorded. Clinical-demographic and spinal radiographic
  data pertaining to difficult procedures were analyzed. RESULTS: Success was achieved
  in all 260 (100%) lumbar punctures for 44 patients, with first pass and first attempt
  success rates of 70% (183/260) and 87% (226/260), respectively. Adverse events were
  infrequent and benign. Higher BMI, greater skin dural sac depth and smaller interlaminar
  size might be associated with greater difficulty in lumbar puncture. CONCLUSIONS:
  The novel ultrasound-assisted horizontal and perpendicular interlaminar needle trajectory
  approach is an effective and safe method for lumbar puncture in patients with spinal
  deformities. This method can be reliably performed at the bedside and avoids other
  more typical and complex imaging such as computed tomography guided procedure.'
