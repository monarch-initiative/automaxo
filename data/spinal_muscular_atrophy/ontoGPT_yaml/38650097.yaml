input_text: 'Improved therapeutic approach for spinal muscular atrophy via ubiquitination-resistant
  survival motor neuron variant. BACKGROUND: Zolgensma is a gene-replacement therapy
  that has led to a promising treatment for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). However,
  clinical trials of Zolgensma have raised two major concerns: insufficient therapeutic
  effects and adverse events. In a recent clinical trial, 30% of patients failed to
  achieve motor milestones despite pre-symptomatic treatment. In addition, more than
  20% of patients showed hepatotoxicity due to excessive virus dosage, even after
  the administration of an immunosuppressant. Here, we aimed to test whether a ubiquitination-resistant
  variant of survival motor neuron (SMN), SMNK186R, has improved therapeutic effects
  for SMA compared with wild-type SMN (SMNWT). METHODS: A severe SMA mouse model,
  SMA type 1.5 (Smn-/-; SMN2+/+; SMN 7+/-) mice, was used to compare the differences
  in therapeutic efficacy between AAV9-SMNWT and AAV9-SMNK186R. All animals were injected
  within Postnatal Day (P) 1 through a facial vein or cerebral ventricle. RESULTS:
  AAV9-SMNK186R-treated mice showed increased lifespan, body weight, motor neuron
  number, muscle weight and functional improvement in motor functions as compared
  with AAV9-SMNWT-treated mice. Lifespan increased by more than 10-fold in AAV9-SMNK186R-treated
  mice (144.8 +- 26.11 days) as compared with AAV9-SMNWT-treated mice (26.8 +- 1.41
  days). AAV9-SMNK186R-treated mice showed an ascending weight pattern, unlike AAV9-SMNWT-treated
  mice, which only gained weight until P20 up to 5 g on average. Several motor function
  tests showed the improved therapeutic efficacy of SMNK186R. In the negative geotaxis
  test, AAV9-SMNK186R-treated mice turned their bodies in an upward direction successfully,
  unlike AAV9-SMNWT-treated mice, which failed to turn upwards from around P23. Hind
  limb clasping phenotype was rarely observed in AAV9-SMNK186R-treated mice, unlike
  AAV9-SMNWT-treated mice that showed clasping phenotype for more than 20 out of 30
  s. At this point, the number of motor neurons (1.5-fold) and the size of myofibers
  (2.1-fold) were significantly increased in AAV9-SMNK186R-treated mice compared with
  AAV9-SMNWT-treated mice without prominent neurotoxicity. AAV9-SMNK186R had fewer
  liver defects compared with AAV9-SMNWT, as judged by increased proliferation of
  hepatocytes (P < 0.0001) and insulin-like growth factor-1 production (P < 0.0001).
  Especially, low-dose AAV9-SMNK186R (nine-fold) also reduced clasping time compared
  with SMNWT. CONCLUSIONS: SMNK186R will provide improved therapeutic efficacy in
  patients with severe SMA with insufficient therapeutic efficacy. Low-dose treatment
  of SMA patients with AAV9-SMNK186R can reduce the adverse events of Zolgensma. Collectively,
  SMNK186R has value as a new treatment for SMA that improves treatment effectiveness
  and reduces adverse events simultaneously.'
