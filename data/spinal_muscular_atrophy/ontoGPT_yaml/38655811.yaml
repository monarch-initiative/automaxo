input_text: 'Genetic therapies and respiratory outcomes in patients with neuromuscular
  disease. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Genetic therapies made a significant impact to the clinical
  course of patients with spinal muscular atrophy and Duchenne muscular dystrophy.
  Clinicians and therapists who care for these patients want to know the changes in
  respiratory sequelae and implications for clinical care for treated patients. RECENT
  FINDINGS: Different genetic therapy approaches have been developed to replace the
  deficient protein product in spinal muscular atrophy and Duchenne muscular dystrophy.
  The natural history of these conditions needed to be understood in order to design
  clinical trials. Respiratory parameters were not the primary outcome measures for
  the clinical trials. The impact of these therapies is described in subsequent clinical
  trial reports or real-world data. SUMMARY: Genetic therapies are able to stabilize
  or improve the respiratory sequelae in patients with spinal muscular atrophy and
  Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Standardized reporting of these outcomes is needed
  to help inform the future revisions of clinical standards of care and practice guidelines.'
