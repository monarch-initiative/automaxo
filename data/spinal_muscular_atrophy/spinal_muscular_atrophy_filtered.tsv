39514033	Real-time measurement of radiation exposure in interventional radiologists during CT-guided intrathecal injections of nusinersen.	PURPOSE: Some patients with spinal muscular atrophy and scoliosis require CT guidance during injections of nusinersen. The radiation applied to the operator in such procedures becomes an important issue in terms of staff health and safety. The aim of the study was to assess the operator's radiation exposure during CT-guided nusinersen injections in patients with spinal muscular atrophy and scoliosis. METHODS: Consecutive 40 CT-guided nusinersen injections were analyzed in terms of operator's radiation exposure measured in real time. RESULTS: The median radiation dose measured under the physician's lead apron and patient dose in terms of DLP was 0.20 microSv and 31.90 mGy*cm respectively. The radiation doses were significantly higher (p = 0.047) in patients with spinal instrumentation. CONCLUSION: The results show that CT-guided nusinersen injection is a relatively safe procedure in terms of operator's radiation exposure. This can allow for interventional radiologists to perform more procedures without exceeding their annual dose limit.

Chinese researchers have contributed significantly to these areas, with a higher reporting frequency of SMA-related topics compared to other countries. CONCLUSION: This bibliometric analysis provides a comprehensive overview of global SMA research, highlighting significant advancements, and identifying future directions. The findings offer valuable insights for researchers, clinicians, and policymakers in China to ensure alignment with global medical advancements and improve the lives of individuals affected by SMA.
38360004	RNA therapeutics for treatment of diabetes.	Diabetes is an ongoing global problem as it affects health of more than 537 million people around the world. Diabetes leaves many serious complications that affect patients and can cause death if not detected and treated promptly. Some of the complications of diabetes include impaired vascular system, increased risk of stroke, neurological diseases that cause pain and numbness, diseases related to the retina leading to blindness, and other complications affecting kidneys, heart failure, muscle weakness, muscle atrophy. All complications of diabetes seriously affect the health of patients. Recently, gene therapy has emerged as a viable treatment strategy for various diseases. DNA and RNA are among the target molecules that can change the structure and function of proteins and are effective methods of treating diseases, especially genetically inherited diseases. RNA therapeutics has attracted deep interest as it has been approved for application in the treatment of functional system disorders such as spinal muscular atrophy, and muscular dystrophy. In this review, we cover the types of RNA therapies considered for treatment of diabetes. In particular, we delve into the mechanism of action of RNA therapies for diabetes, and studies involving testing of these RNA therapies. Finally, we have highlighted the limitations of the current understanding in the mechanism of action of RNA therapies.
39848090	A 7-year delayed diagnosis in a case of spinal muscular atrophy.	BACKGROUND: Most cases of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) can be diagnosed by copy number analysis of survival motor neuron (SMN) 1. However, a small number of cases of SMA can only be diagnosed by sequencing analysis. We present a case of SMA diagnosed 7 years after the onset of symptoms. CASE REPORT: She was a 12-year-old girl of Sri Lankan origin. At age 5, she began to fall easily. She had normal intellectual development, and electromyography suggested a neurogenic disorder. Copy number analysis of SMN1 exons 7 and 8 via polymerase chain reaction revealed at least one copy of SMN1. Exome sequence analysis for neuromuscular disorders panel could not detect the pathogenic mutation. She moved to Japan at the age of 12 years. Sequencing analysis later identified a novel mutation in SMN1 at the same locus as previously reported (c.284G>A: p.Gly95Glu). Multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification indicated she had two copies of SMN2. She was diagnosed with SMA type 3b and treated with nusinersen. DISCUSSION: In patients with SMA, 2-5 % have a point mutation or a small insertion/deletion in SMN1. Since copy number analysis cannot detect such mutations, sequencing analysis is required. Two copies of SMN2 often result in SMA type 1 or 2, but her mild symptoms of SMA type 3b may be due to a combination of a point mutation and a deletion in SMN1. CONCLUSION: Even if genetic testing has been performed at previous institutions, sequencing analysis should be considered if the patient's symptoms are consistent with SMA.
38898231	Gene therapy for CNS disorders: modalities, delivery and translational challenges.	Gene therapy is emerging as a powerful tool to modulate abnormal gene expression, a hallmark of most CNS disorders. The transformative potentials of recently approved gene therapies for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and active cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy are encouraging further development of this approach. However, most attempts to translate gene therapy to the clinic have failed to make it to market. There is an urgent need not only to tailor the genes that are targeted to the pathology of interest but to also address delivery challenges and thereby maximize the utility of genetic tools. In this Review, we provide an overview of gene therapy modalities for CNS diseases, emphasizing the interconnectedness of different delivery strategies and routes of administration. Important gaps in understanding that could accelerate the clinical translatability of CNS genetic interventions are addressed, and we present lessons learned from failed clinical trials that may guide the future development of gene therapies for the treatment and management of CNS disorders.
39191071	Neurosurgical gene therapy for central nervous system diseases.	Viral vector mediated gene therapies for neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental conditions that require neurosurgical administration continue to expand. We systematically reviewed the National Institutes of Health (NIH) ClinicalTrials.gov database to identify all clinical trials studying in-vivo viral vector mediated gene therapies targeted to the CNS for neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases. We isolated studies which delivered therapies using neurosurgical approaches: intracisternal, intraventricular, and/or intraparenchymal. Clinical trials primarily registered in international countries were included if they were referenced by an NIH registered clinical trial. We performed a scoping review to identify the preclinical studies that supported each human clinical trial. Key preclinical and clinical data were aggregated to characterize vector capsid design, delivery methods, gene expression profile, and clinical benefit. A total of 64 clinical trials were identified in active, completed, terminated, and long-term follow-up stages. A range of CNS conditions across pediatric and adult populations are being studied with CNS targeted viral vector gene therapy, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, AADC deficiency, sphingolipidoses, mucopolysaccharidoses, neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses, spinal muscular atrophy, adrenoleukodystrophy, Canavan disease, frontotemporal dementia, Huntington's disease, Rett syndrome, Dravet syndrome, mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, and glutaric acidemia. Adeno-associated viral vectors (AAVs) were utilized by the majority of tested therapies, with vector serotypes, regulatory elements, delivery methods, and vector monitoring varying based on the disease being studied. Intraparenchymal delivery has evolved significantly, with MRI-guided convection-enhanced delivery established as a gold standard method for pioneering novel gene targets.
38888134	Impact of Spinal Surgery on Intrathecal Nusinersen Injections in Pediatric Spinal Muscular Atrophy.	BACKGROUND: Complex spinal deformities necessitate surgical interventions that may intervene with intrathecal injections in patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). This study aimed to determine the effect of spinal deformity correction surgery on nusinersen administration. METHODS: Pediatric patients with SMA, operated by a single surgeon, either via magnetically controlled growing rod (MCGR) or definitive fusion (DF) with skip instrumentation, were evaluated retrospectively in terms of safety and feasibility of intrathecal injections. Patients' and their parents' perspectives were evaluated through a questionnaire regarding any shift in the setting of injections. RESULTS: Fourteen patients with 15 spinal surgeries (10 MCGR and 5 DF) were included. Eleven patients received intrathecal treatment both before and after the surgery. Preoperative (n=3) and postoperative (n=9) fluoroscopic guidance was required leading to a shift in the application settings in 6 patients. Of 106 preoperative injections, 15% required fluoroscopy and 2% required anesthesia. Postoperatively, of 88 injections, 73% required fluoroscopy and 26% required anesthesia. No patients discontinued intrathecal injections due to technical difficulties associated with the spinal surgery. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that spinal surgery does not prevent safe and successful intrathecal nusinersen injections. In the DF group, the skip instrumentation technique provided access to interlaminal space for intrathecal injections. In either surgical group, no further auxillary approach was required. Modifications in the injection technique require an institutional approach, and concerns of patients and their families should be addressed accordingly. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV.
39987313	Multiple respiratory assessment and thresholds for noninvasive ventilation in adult patients with spinal muscular atrophy.	This study aimed to examine feasibility of inspiratory muscle strength tests, such as maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) and sniff nasal inspiratory pressure (SNIP) in adult patients affected by spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), as well as their ability, along with forced vital capacity (FVC), to predict noninvasive ventilation (NIV) needs. Additionally, we evaluated feasibility and effectiveness of respiratory oscillometric measurements in the same patients. Twenty patients were retrospectively evaluated. NIV requirement was considered as peak nocturnal transcutaneous PCO2 > 49 mmHg, according to the cut-off used by Ward et al. MIP and SNIP were feasible in all patients. SNIP had significantly higher values (p < 0.001) and poorly agreed with MIP. ROC analysis revealed MIP as a weak predictor for NIV initiation (AUC = 0.57), while FVC (AUC 0.78, best cut-off 20% of predicted) and SNIP (AUC 0.84, best cut-off 61 cmH2O) were more effective. Oscillometry was performed in 11 patients. Reactance was abnormal in six of them and was significantly correlated with FVC (rho = 0.70, p = 0.01) and SNIP (rho = 0.72, p = 0.007), but not with MIP. In adult SMA patients, both MIP and SNIP are feasible, but SNIP is a better predictor of NIV needs, similar to FVC. Optimal predictive thresholds differed from those previously observed in neuromuscular disease. Oscillometric measurements may help to estimate FVC and SNIP in poorly collaborating patients.
39426797	Clinicogenetic characterization and response to disease-modifying therapies in spinal muscular atrophy: real-world experience from a reference center in Southern Brazil.	OBJECTIVE: Spinal Muscular Atrophy linked to chromosome 5q (SMA) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive proximal muscle atrophy and weakness. This study addresses the scarcity of research on novel disease-modifying therapies for SMA in Latin America by reporting a real-world experience in Southern Brazil. METHODOLOGY: This is a single-center historical cohort that included all patients diagnosed with spinal muscular atrophy at a Regional Reference Service for rare diseases. RESULTS: Eighty-one patients were included, of whom 7 died during follow-up. Of the remaining 74 patients, 5.4 % were classified as pre-symptomatic, 24.3 % with SMA type 1, 28.4 % with type 2, 36.5 % with type 3, and 5.4 % with type 4. The mean follow-up time ranged from 1.8 years for pre-symptomatic cases to 8.7 years for SMA types 2 and 3. Approximately 42 % of these patients received specific disease-modifying therapy, of these, 96.8 % received Nusinersen, with 19.4 % transitioning to gene therapy using Onasemnogene Abeparvovec, and 6.4 % starting Risdiplam. Most patients with SMA type 1 were on disease-modifying treatment, whereas only slightly over a third of patients with type 2 and about 10 % of type 3 were receiving such treatments. Among treated patients, 80 % demonstrated improvement in motor performance during the follow-up, with a lesser therapeutic response being associated with late initiation of treatment and low motor function scores at baseline. CONCLUSION: This real-world study reinforces the effectiveness of disease-modifying therapies for SMA in Brazil within the context of low- and middle-income countries, which is greater the earlier and the better the patient's functional status.
39958595	Triumphs, Trials, and Future Considerations in Genetic Therapies for Hereditary Neuromuscular Diseases.	Neuromuscular diseases include conditions that affect the spinal motor neurons, peripheral nerves, neuromuscular junctions, and muscles, and they can result from acquired and inherited causes. The number of genetic therapies targeting the inherited causes of neuromuscular diseases has surged in the last decade. This review aims to highlight the current state of genetic therapies within the framework of precision medicine, focusing on the achievements and the gaps that remain. A major emphasis is on spinal muscular atrophy, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, as these neuromuscular diseases have seen tremendous recent advancements. We will also discuss the future considerations necessary to accelerate the development of next-generation genetic therapies and enhance therapeutic outcomes for patients with neuromuscular diseases.
39010073	A horizontal and perpendicular interlaminar approach for intrathecal nusinersen injection in patients with spinal muscular atrophy and scoliosis: an observational study.	BACKGROUND: Lumbar puncture is challenging for patients with scoliosis. Previous ultrasound-assisted techniques for lumbar puncture used the angle of the probe as the needle trajectory; however, reproducing the angle is difficult and increases the number of needle manipulations. In response, we developed a technique that eliminated both the craniocaudal and lateromedial angulation of the needle trajectory to overall improve this technique. We assessed the feasibility and safety of this method in patients with scoliosis and identify factors related to difficult lumbar puncture. METHODS: Patients with spinal muscular atrophy and scoliosis who were referred to the anesthesia department for intrathecal nusinersen administrations were included. With a novel approach that utilized patient position and geometry, lumbar puncture was performed under ultrasound guidance. Success rates, performance times and adverse events were recorded. Clinical-demographic and spinal radiographic data pertaining to difficult procedures were analyzed. RESULTS: Success was achieved in all 260 (100%) lumbar punctures for 44 patients, with first pass and first attempt success rates of 70% (183/260) and 87% (226/260), respectively. Adverse events were infrequent and benign. Higher BMI, greater skin dural sac depth and smaller interlaminar size might be associated with greater difficulty in lumbar puncture. CONCLUSIONS: The novel ultrasound-assisted horizontal and perpendicular interlaminar needle trajectory approach is an effective and safe method for lumbar puncture in patients with spinal deformities. This method can be reliably performed at the bedside and avoids other more typical and complex imaging such as computed tomography guided procedure.
38856793	Novel Gene Therapy Approaches for Targeting Neurodegenerative Disorders: Focusing on Delivering Neurotrophic Genes.	Neurodegenerative illnesses (NDDs) like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal muscular atrophy, and Huntington's disease have demonstrated considerable potential for gene therapy as a viable therapeutic intervention. NDDs are marked by the decline of neurons, resulting in changes in both behavior and pathology within the body. Strikingly, only symptomatic management is available without a cure for the NDDs. There is an unmet need for a permanent therapeutic approach. Many studies have been going on to target the newer therapeutic molecular targets for NDDs including gene-based therapy. Gene therapy has the potential to provide therapeutic benefits to a large number of patients with NDDs by offering mechanisms including neuroprotection, neuro-restoration, and rectification of pathogenic pathways. Gene therapy is a medical approach that aims to modify the biological characteristics of living cells by controlling the expression of specific genes in certain neurological disorders. Despite being the most complex and well-protected organ in the human body, there is clinical evidence to show that it is possible to specifically target the central nervous system (CNS). This provides hope for the prospective application of gene therapy in treating NDDs in the future. There are several advanced techniques available for using viral or non-viral vectors to deliver the therapeutic gene to the afflicted region. Neurotrophic factors (NTF) in the brain are crucial for the development, differentiation, and survival of neurons in the CNS, making them important in the context of various neurological illnesses. Gene delivery of NTF has the potential to be used as a therapeutic approach for the treatment of neurological problems in the brain. This review primarily focuses on the methodologies employed for delivering the genes of different NTFs to treat neurological disorders. These techniques are currently being explored as a viable therapeutic approach for neurodegenerative diseases. The article exclusively addresses gene delivery approaches and does not cover additional therapy strategies for NDDs. Gene therapy offers a promising alternative treatment for NDDs by stimulating neuronal growth instead of solely relying on symptom relief from drugs and their associated adverse effects. It can serve as a long-lasting and advantageous treatment choice for the management of NDDs. The likelihood of developing NDDs increases with age as a result of neuronal degradation in the brain. Gene therapy is an optimal approach for promoting neuronal growth through the introduction of nerve growth factor genes.
39111255	Risk-benefit profile of onasemnogene abeparvovec in older and heavier children with spinal muscular atrophy type 1.	Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive disorder with progressive muscle atrophy and weakness, caused by biallelic mutations in the survival motor neuron 1 (SNM1) gene. Onasemnogene abeparvovec (OA) is an approved gene replacement therapy for patients with SMA. We report on two patients with SMA type 1, weighing 20 kg, previously treated with Nusinersen, who received OA infusion at 7 years of age. To our knowledge, these two patients are the heaviest treated in the real-world and we describe their different courses after gene therapy, including liver impairment requiring long-term steroid treatment and additional immunosuppression, with only transitory improvement in functional outcomes. Our cases illustrate how careful risk-benefit consideration is required in treating older and heavier SMA patients with OA, especially in view of the multiple treatment choices available for older patients with SMA.
38905882	An updated systematic review on spinal muscular atrophy patients treated with nusinersen, onasemnogene abeparvovec (at least 24 months), risdiplam (at least 12 months) or combination therapies.	OBJECTIVE: This systematic review provides an update on outcomes for patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type 1 to 4 treated with approved therapeutics, including the most recent, risdiplam, for an observation period of up to 48 months. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted in July 2023 in four databases. Selected publications were assessed for internal validity and risk of bias by two authors and relevant data were extracted into standardised tables. Results were summarised narratively as substantial heterogeneity of studies prevents meaningful quantitative analysis. RESULTS: Twenty observational studies and one RCT were included in the analysis, fifteen studies on nusinersen, one on onasemnogene abeparvovec and two on risdiplam. Evidence supports the effectiveness of the therapies in motor function improvement for up to 48 months of follow-up in the SMA types specified in their respective indications. Better results were observed with earlier treatment initiation and higher baseline function. Whilst motor improvement was consistently observed, regardless of SMA type or treatment used, we noted no significant improvements in respiratory and nutritional outcomes. Quality of life endpoints were rarely investigated. Adverse events were common but seldom classified as treatment-related except for post-lumbar puncture syndrome, which was frequently reported across nusinersen studies. CONCLUSION: The treatment of SMA with the new therapies changes the disease phenotype with changes in motor function far exceeding any improvement in respiratory and nutritional function. Questions persist on long-term efficacy, potential regressions, impact on quality of life and social functioning, therapy duration, and discontinuation indicators.
39973581	Experiences of families of children with spinal muscular atrophy and the healthcare professionals supporting them during the COVID-19 pandemic: A nationwide study.	PURPOSE: This study aimed to explore how parents and grandparents of children with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) perceived how the COVID-19 pandemic affected their access to medication and physiotherapy. Further, healthcare professionals' experiences of the care of children with SMA during the pandemic were explored. METHODS: Thirty-nine parents and three grandmothers of 28 children with SMA answered a web-based survey at two time-points. Telephone follow-ups were conducted with seven of the parents. Parallel focus group interviews were conducted with three interdisciplinary teams of healthcare professionals. RESULTS: Results showed that 21 family members, 12 children, and nine parents in the study tested positive for COVID-19 during the pandemic. None of the children became seriously ill. All respondents, however, indicated that the pandemic had a significant impact on their everyday life. It made socializing difficult for the children and reduced their access to physiotherapy, hydrotherapy, and personal care attendants. The pandemic also influenced the location of some nusinersen treatments. The professionals reported that, although much of their work continued as usual, they experienced increased stress from their role in nusinersen assessments. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that it may be valuable to find ways for healthcare professionals to support each other and to support their efforts to help severely ill children and their families now that healthcare systems have opened up again.
38330285	Safety and Efficacy of Apitegromab in Patients With Spinal Muscular Atrophy Types 2 and 3: The Phase 2 TOPAZ Study.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Currently approved therapies for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) reverse the degenerative course, leading to better functional outcome, but they do not address the impairment arising from preexisting neurodegeneration. Apitegromab, an investigational, fully human monoclonal antibody, inhibits activation of myostatin (a negative regulator of skeletal muscle growth), thereby preserving muscle mass. The phase 2 TOPAZ trial assessed the safety and efficacy of apitegromab in individuals with later-onset type 2 and type 3 SMA. METHODS: In this study, designed to investigate potential meaningful combinations of eligibility and treatment regimen for future studies, participants aged 2-21 years received IV apitegromab infusions every 4 weeks for 12 months in 1 of 3 cohorts. Cohort 1 stratified ambulatory participants aged 5-21 years into 2 arms (apitegromab 20 mg/kg alone or in combination with nusinersen); cohort 2 evaluated apitegromab 20 mg/kg combined with nusinersen in nonambulatory participants aged 5-21 years; and cohort 3 blindly evaluated 2 randomized apitegromab doses (2 and 20 mg/kg) combined with nusinersen in younger participants >=2 years of age. The primary efficacy measure was mean change from baseline using the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale version appropriate for each cohort. Data were analyzed using a paired t test with 2-sided 5% type 1 error for the mean change from baseline for predefined cohort-specific primary efficacy end points. RESULTS: Fifty-eight participants (mean age 9.4 years) were enrolled at 16 trial sites in the United States and Europe. Participants had been treated with nusinersen for a mean of 25.9 months before enrollment in any of the 3 trial cohorts. At month 12, the mean change from baseline in Hammersmith scale score was -0.3 points (95% CI -2.1 to 1.4) in cohort 1 (n = 23), 0.6 points (-1.4 to 2.7) in cohort 2 (n = 15), and in cohort 3 (n = 20), the mean scores were 5.3 (-1.5 to 12.2) and 7.1 (1.8 to 12.5) for the 2-mg/kg (n = 8) and 20-mg/kg (n = 9) arms, respectively. The 5 most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse events were headache (24.1%), pyrexia (22.4%), upper respiratory tract infection (22.4%), cough (22.4%), and nasopharyngitis (20.7%). No deaths or serious adverse reactions were reported. DISCUSSION: Apitegromab led to improved motor function in participants with later-onset types 2 and 3 SMA. These results support a randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial of apitegromab in participants with SMA. TRIAL REGISTRATION INFORMATION: This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03921528). CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class III evidence that apitegromab improves motor function in later-onset types 2 and 3 spinal muscular atrophy.
40121811	Fluoroscopic guidance for intrathecal delivery of nusinersen in pediatric patients with spinal muscular atrophy and complex spines.	The introduction of nusinersen revolutionized the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). However, nusinersen is administered by interlaminar intrathecal injection which is challenging in patients with severe scoliosis, a common comorbidity of advanced SMA. This study evaluated the technical benefits of fluoroscopic guidance of intrathecal nusinersen administration in complex SMA patients with or without a fixation device. The cohort included 12 patients aged 10-20 years (total 124 injections). The total success rate was 99 %, with failure to complete only one out of 124 procedures. Demographic characteristics were diverse. Mean age at first injection was 14.2 years. Mean duration of radiation exposure was 77 s; mean dose area product was 2.32 Gycm2; and mean cumulative air kerma was 20.91mGy. Adverse events included post-dural-puncture headache (4.8 % of procedures), mostly mild and self-limited, and one allergic reaction. Treatment was discontinued in 2 patients because of difficult intrathecal access, and in 2 for reasons unrelated to the injection technique. Fluoroscopy-guided nusinersen administration is a feasible option for patients with SMA and complex access. Success depends on proper patient positioning and expertise of the interventional radiologist. Radiation exposure is lower than with other techniques. Larger prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings.
39248281	Drug-induced liver injury related to gene therapy: A new challenge to be managed.	Gene therapy is being successfully developed for the treatment of several genetic disorders. Various methods of gene transfer have been developed to enable the production of the deficient enzyme or protein. One of the most important is adeno-associated virus vectors, which have been shown to be viable for use in in vivo gene therapy. Several gene therapies have already been approved. They are also promising for acquired diseases. Important examples include gene therapy for haemophilia A and B, X-linked myotubular myopathy, spinal muscular atrophy and several liver diseases such as Criggler-Najjar disease, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and Fabry disease. However, the introduction of a foreign compound into hepatocytes leads to hepatic reactions with heterogeneous phenotypic expression and a wide spectrum of severity, ranging from mild transaminase elevation to acute liver failure. Several mechanisms appear to be involved in liver injury, including an immune response, but also direct toxicity depending on the method of gene transfer. As a result, the incidence, expression and severity of liver injury vary from indication to indication and from patient to patient. Patients treated for haemophilia A are more prone to transaminase elevation than those treated for haemophilia B. Corticosteroids are successfully used to correct liver reactions but also to prevent degradation of the transferred gene and loss of therapeutic activity. The aim of this review is to describe the risk of liver injury according to the indication for gene therapy and the short- and long-term management currently proposed to prevent or correct liver reactions in clinical practice.
39216878	Spinal muscular atrophy in an upper-middle-income nation before the advent of reimbursed disease-modifying therapies.	OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the clinical characteristics and standard of care (SoC) of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) patients in Thailand, focusing on primary endpoints: age at death and a composite of death or tracheostomy need. DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. SETTING: Seven tertiary centres across Thailand. PATIENTS: Records of 110 patients with genetically confirmed SMA, spanning 2012-2021. INTERVENTIONS: Historical data review; no active interventions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Age at death and a composite measure of death or tracheostomy necessity. RESULTS: The cohort included 1 SMA0, 50 SMA1, 40 SMA2 and 19 SMA3 cases. Median ages at the onset and diagnosis of SMA1 were 3 and 6.2 months. Of SMA1 patients, 63% required ventilators, and eight received dimethyltryptamines (DMTs) at a median of 15 months (range 6.4-24.5 months). The median time from onset to DMT was 11 months (range 4.2-20.5 months). Among SMA1 patients, 73% died by the study's end. SMA2 and SMA3 patients' median onset ages were 11 and 24 months, respectively, with diagnosis at 24.8 and 68.7 months. Half of all types received physical therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Significant delays in diagnosis and SoC access, including DMTs, were observed, underscoring urgent needs for improved diagnostic and care strategies to enhance SMA patient outcomes in Thailand.
38462459	Viral Vectors in Gene Replacement Therapy.	Throughout the years, several hundred million people with rare genetic disorders have been receiving only symptom management therapy. However, research and development efforts worldwide have led to the development of long-lasting, highly efficient, and safe gene therapy for a wide range of hereditary diseases. Improved viral vectors are now able to evade the preexisting immunity and more efficiently target and transduce therapeutically relevant cells, ensuring genome maintenance and expression of transgenes at the relevant levels. Hematological, ophthalmological, neurodegenerative, and metabolic therapeutic areas have witnessed successful treatment of hemophilia and muscular dystrophy, restoration of immune system in children with immunodeficiencies, and restoration of vision. This review focuses on three leading vector platforms of the past two decades: adeno-associated viruses (AAVs), adenoviruses (AdVs), and lentiviruses (LVs). Special attention is given to successful preclinical and clinical studies that have led to the approval of gene therapies: six AAV-based (Glybera  for lipoprotein lipase deficiency, Luxturna  for retinal dystrophy, Zolgensma  for spinal muscular atrophy, Upstaza  for AADC, Roctavian  for hemophilia A, and Hemgenix  for hemophilia B) and three LV-based (Libmeldy  for infantile metachromatic leukodystrophy, Zynteglo  for beta-thalassemia, and Skysona  for ALD). The review also discusses the problems that arise in the development of gene therapy treatments, which, nevertheless, do not overshadow the successes of already developed gene therapies and the hope these treatments give to long-suffering patients and their families.
38308795	Observational analysis of the immunogenicity and safety of various types of spinal muscular atrophy vaccines.	BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of different types of poliovirus vaccines. METHODS: A randomized, blinded, single-center, parallel-controlled design was employed, and 360 infants aged >= 2 months were selected as study subjects. They were randomly assigned to bOPV group (oral Sabin vaccine) and sIPV group (Sabin strain inactivated polio vaccine), with 180 infants in each group. Adverse reaction events in the vaccinated subjects were recorded. The micro-neutralization test using cell culture was conducted to determine the geometric mean titer (GMT) of neutralizing antibodies against poliovirus types I, II, and III in different groups, and the seroconversion rates were calculated. RESULTS: Both groups exhibited a 100% seropositivity rate after booster immunization. The titers of neutralizing antibodies for the three types were predominantly distributed within the range of 1:128 to 1:512. The fold increase of type I antibodies differed markedly between the two groups (P < 0.05). Moreover, the fold increase of type II and type III antibodies for poliovirus differed slightly between the two groups (P > 0.05). The fourfold increase rate in sIPV group was drastically superior to that in bOPV group (P < 0.05). When comparing the post-immunization GMT levels of type I antibodies in individuals who completed the full course of spinal muscular atrophy vaccination, bOPV group showed greatly inferior levels to sIPV group (P < 0.05). For type II and type III antibodies, individuals in bOPV group demonstrated drastically superior post-immunization GMT levels to those in sIPV group (P < 0.05). The incidence of adverse reactions between the bOPV and sIPV groups differed slightly (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: These findings indicated that both the oral vaccine and inactivated vaccine had good safety and immunogenicity in infants aged >= 2 months. The sIPV group generated higher levels of neutralizing antibodies in serum, particularly evident in the post-immunization GMT levels for types II and III.
39208519	Oximetry and carbon dioxide screening for ventilatory requirements in children with spinal muscular atrophy type 1-3.	INTRODUCTION: Despite disease modifying treatments (DMT), assisted ventilation is commonly required in children with Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA). Guidelines suggest screening with oximetry and transcutaneous carbon dioxide (TcCO2) for sleep disordered breathing (SDB). AIM: To determine the utility of pulse oximetry and TcCO2 as a screen for SDB and the need for Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV) in children with SMA type 1-3. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted in Queensland, Australia. Full diagnostic PSG was completed in DMT naive children with SMA. Pulse oximetry and TcCO2 were extracted from PSG. Apnoea-hypopnoea indices (AHI) criteria were applied to PSG results to define the need for NIV. Abnormal was defined as: <=3 months of age [mo] AHI>=10 events/hour; >3mo AHI >=5 events/hour. Receiver operating characteristic curves were calculated for abnormal PSG and pulse oximetry/TcCO2 variables, and diagnostic statistics were calculated. RESULTS: Forty-seven untreated children with SMA were recruited (type 1 n = 13; 2 n = 21; 3 n = 13) ranging from 0.2 to 18.8 years old (median 4.9 years). Oxygen desaturation index >=4 % (ODI4) >=20events/hour had sensitivity 82.6 % (95 % CI 61.2-95.0) and specificity of 58.3 % (95 % CI 36.6-77.9). TcCO2 alone and combinations of oximetry/TcCO2 had low diagnostic ability. The same methodology was applied to 36 children who were treated (type 1 n = 7; type 2 n = 17; type n = 12) and oximetry+-TcCO2 had low diagnostic ability. CONCLUSION: ODI4 >=20events/hour can predict the need for NIV in untreated children with SMA. TcCO2 monitoring does not improve the PPV. If normal however, children may still require a diagnostic PSG. Neither oximetry nor TcCO2 monitoring were useful screening tests in the children treated with DMT.
39049699	Transverse interlaminar ultrasound-guided C1-C2 puncture for the intrathecal administration of nusinersen in patients with spinal muscular atrophy.	INTRODUCTION/AIMS: Severe spinal deformities and previous spinal orthopedic instrumentation may result in substantial technical challenges for nusinersen delivery through lumbar puncture in patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). The aim of this paper was to review our experience with ultrasound-guided cervical puncture as an alternative approach for the intrathecal administration of nusinersen. METHODS: This was a retrospective medical record review of transverse interlaminar ultrasound-guided C1-C2 puncture for nusinersen delivery in SMA patients. The details of puncture, complications, and success rate of the procedure were summarized. RESULTS: There were four patients who received a total of 13 cervical punctures for nusinersen delivery. All procedures were technically successful with no major complications. Full doses of nusinersen were delivered intrathecally. DISCUSSION: Transverse interlaminar ultrasound-guided C1-C2 puncture is an alternative approach for administering nusinersen if lumbar puncture fails. The success of the technique requires a thorough preprocedural evaluation of cervical spine imaging, sound knowledge of the cervical sonoanatomy and careful manipulation of the needle.
39832442	Difficulty of administration of nusinersen in complex-column spinal muscular atrophy: New alternative technique by means of cervical intrathecal access through an Ommaya reservoir.	BACKGROUND: The study aimed to describe a new Ommaya reservoir implantation method in late-onset SMA patients, assessing its safety and effectiveness under standard clinical conditions. METHODS: Prospective observational study. Lumbar intrathecal access was unfeasible due to significant scoliosis and prior spinal surgeries with instrumentation. Patients were infused with Nusinersen through the Ommaya reservoir at Hospital Universitario La Paz (Spain) following the standard dosing protocol. RESULTS: The cohort was composed of 6 patients, 5 individuals with type 2 SMA (83.3 %), and 1 patient presenting with type 3 SMA. 4 of the patients were functionally sitters (66.7 %) and 2 had lost this ability prior to initiating treatment (non-sitters). Mean treatment was 34.7 months. Patient discharge was done in all the cases within 48 h post-admission; no significant postoperative complications or during administration of nusinersen were reported. Functional progress was observed in all patients. Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE) showed a low average increase (1.0), attributed to the severity of baseline functional impairments. Improvements in upper extremity motor function, measured by the Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM), were more pronounced, with an average improvement of 3.3. Disability levels as measured by the Egen Klassifikation 2 (EK2) scale, declined by 4.4. CONCLUSION: the current study broadens knowledge regarding the efficacy and safety of using an Ommaya reservoir to administer nusinersen in patients with SMA Types 2 and 3. The technique demonstrated rapid, straightforward drug delivery through a subcutaneous needle, maintaining optimal sterility without radiation or the need for a multidisciplinary team.
39033753	Transforming care for spinal muscular atrophy: A critical look at treatment paradigms.	
39272200	Real-world multidisciplinary outcomes of onasemnogene abeparvovec monotherapy in patients with spinal muscular atrophy type 1: experience of the French cohort in the first three years of treatment.	BACKGROUND: Spinal muscular atrophy type 1 (SMA1) is the most severe and early form of SMA, a genetic disease with motor neuron degeneration. Onasemnogene abeparvovec gene transfer therapy (GT) has changed the natural history of SMA1, but real-world data are scarce. METHODS: A French national expert committee identified 95 newly diagnosed treatment-naive SMA1 patients between June 2019 and June 2022. We prospectively report on children treated with GT as the first and only therapy who had more than one-year of follow-up. RESULTS: Forty-six SMA1 patients received GT. Twelve patients received other treatments. Patients with respiratory insufficiency were oriented toward palliative care after discussion with families. Twenty-nine of the treated patients with more than 12 months of follow-up were included in the follow-up analysis. Among them, 17 had 24 months of follow-up. The mean age at treatment was 7.5 (2.1-12.5) months. Twenty-two patients had two SMN2 copies, and seven had three copies. One infant died in the month following GT due to severe thrombotic microangiopathy, and another died due to respiratory distress. Among the 17 patients with 24 months of follow-up, 90% required spinal bracing (15/17), three patients required nocturnal noninvasive ventilation, and two needed gastrostomy. Concerning motor milestones at the 24-month follow-up, all patients held their head, 15/17 sat for 30 s unassisted, and 12/17 stood with aid. Motor scores (CHOPINTEND and HINE-2) and thoracic circumference significantly improved in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows favorable motor outcomes and preserved respiratory and feeding functions in treatment-naive SMA1 infants treated by GT as the first and only therapy before respiratory and bulbar dysfunctions occurred. Nevertheless, almost all patients developed spinal deformities.
40076889	Expansion of Splice-Switching Therapy with Antisense Oligonucleotides.	Since 2016, splice-switching therapy, in which splicing is controlled by antisense oligonucleotides, has been applied in clinical practice for spinal muscular atrophy and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. In the former disease, this therapy induces exon inclusion, while, in the latter, it induces exon skipping, leading expression of functional proteins. Basic and clinical studies of splice-switching therapy for many monogenic diseases have now been conducted. The molecular mechanisms of splice-switching therapy include not only the induction of exon inclusion and skipping, but also the induction of pseudoexon skipping and suppression of splicing sites generated by mutations. In addition, therapies that alter protein function by regulating splicing are being investigated not only for monogenic diseases but also for non-monogenic ones such as cancer and immune-related disorders. It is expected that many of these basic studies will be translated into clinical applications. This review describes the current status of basic research and clinical applications of splice-switching therapy to promote the development of treatments for noncurable diseases.
38655811	Genetic therapies and respiratory outcomes in patients with neuromuscular disease.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Genetic therapies made a significant impact to the clinical course of patients with spinal muscular atrophy and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Clinicians and therapists who care for these patients want to know the changes in respiratory sequelae and implications for clinical care for treated patients. RECENT FINDINGS: Different genetic therapy approaches have been developed to replace the deficient protein product in spinal muscular atrophy and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The natural history of these conditions needed to be understood in order to design clinical trials. Respiratory parameters were not the primary outcome measures for the clinical trials. The impact of these therapies is described in subsequent clinical trial reports or real-world data. SUMMARY: Genetic therapies are able to stabilize or improve the respiratory sequelae in patients with spinal muscular atrophy and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Standardized reporting of these outcomes is needed to help inform the future revisions of clinical standards of care and practice guidelines.
39060346	Unveiling the adverse events of Nusinersen in spinal muscular atrophy management based on FAERS database.	This study aims to collect and analyze adverse event (AE) reports related to Nusinersen from the FAERS database. The study employed a combination of signal quantification techniques, including the Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR), Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR), Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN), and Multi-item Gamma Poisson Shrinker (MGPS), to enhance the accuracy of signal detection and reduce the risk of false positives or negatives. Between the first quarter of 2017 and the third quarter of 2023, the FAERS database collected a total of 11,485,105 drug AE reports, of which 5772 were related to Nusinersen. Through signal mining analysis, 218 preferred term (PT) signals involving 27 system organ classes (SOCs) were identified. The study discovered AEs related to metabolism and nutrition disorders, psychiatric disorders, and cardiac disorders SOCs, which were not mentioned in the product information. Additionally, complications directly related to the intrathecal administration of Nusinersen, such as increased CSF pressure, positive CSF red blood cell count, and AEs related to the method of drug use, such as neuromuscular scoliosis and cerebrospinal fluid reservoir placement, were highlighted. Notably, AEs related to renal function abnormalities, such as abnormal Urine protein/creatinine ratio and protein urine presence, showed higher frequency and signal strength. The findings of this study emphasize the importance of comprehensive safety monitoring in the clinical application of Nusinersen. These results are significant for guiding future clinical practices, improving disease management strategies, and developing safer treatment protocols.
39313447	Diagnostic Journey of Korean Patients with Spinal Muscular Atrophy.	PURPOSE: Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive genetic disease characterized by the loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord and brainstem, leading to muscle atrophy and weakness. To understand the diagnostic process of Korean patients with SMA, we analyzed their clinical characteristics and challenges. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of 38 patients with SMA (9 type II and 29 type III) between January 2000 and September 2023. Clinical, laboratory, and genetic data were reviewed. RESULTS: The median ages at symptom onset and diagnosis were 3.0 years [interquartile range (IQR): 1.0-7.3 years] and 25.0 years (IQR: 10.5-37.3 years), respectively. The median diagnostic delay was 19.6 years (IQR: 6.4-31.0 years). A significantly longer delay was observed in SMA type III patients (median: 21.0 years, IQR: 11.0-31.0 years) compared to SMA type II patients (median: 3.0 years, IQR: 0.9-21.0 years) (p=0.021). No significant difference was observed in the number of clinic visits before diagnosis between patients with SMA type II (median: 2.0, IQR: 1.0-4.5) and those with type III (median: 2.0, IQR: 2.0-6.0, p=0.282). The number of clinic visits before diagnosis showed no significant association with the age at symptom onset and diagnosis (p=0.998 and 0.291, respectively). CONCLUSION: Our investigation is the first examination of the diagnostic journey of Korean patients with SMA. As treatments for SMA progress, the significance of an accurate diagnosis has increased, highlighting the importance of reviewing the diagnostic advancements made thus far.
39415296	Acceptability, validity and responsiveness of inertial measurement units for assessing motor recovery after gene therapy in infants with early onset spinal muscular atrophy: a prospective cohort study.	BACKGROUND: Onasemnogene abeparvovec gene replacement therapy (GT) has changed the prognosis of patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) with variable outcome regarding motor development in symptomatic patients. This pilot study evaluates acceptability, validity and clinical relevance of Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) to monitor spontaneous movement recovery in early onset SMA patients after GT. METHODS: Clinical assessments including CHOPINTEND score (the gold standard motor score for infants with SMA) and IMU measurements were performed before (M0) and repeatedly after GT. Inertial data was recorded during a 25-min spontaneous movement task, the child lying on the back, without (10 min) and with a playset (15 min) wearing IMUs. Two commonly used parameters, norm acceleration 95th centile (  A  _95) and counts per minute (  A  _CPM) were computed for each wrist, elbow and foot sensors. RESULTS: 23 SMA-patients were included (mean age at diagnosis 8 months [min 2, max 20], 19 SMA type 1, three type 2 and one presymptomatic) and 104 IMU-measurements were performed, all well accepted by families and 84/104 with a good child participation (evaluated with Brazelton scale).   A  _95 and   A  _CPM showed high internal consistency (without versus with a playset) with interclass correlation coefficient for the wrist sensors of 0.88 and 0.85 respectively and for the foot sensors of 0.93 and 0.91 respectively.   A  _95 and   A  _CPM were strongly correlated with CHOPINTEND (r for wrist sensors 0.74 and 0.67 respectively and for foot sensors 0.61 and 0.68 respectively, p-values < 0.001).   A  _95 for the foot, the wrist, the elbow sensors and   A  _CPM for the foot, the wrist, the elbow sensors increased significantly between baseline and the 12 months follow-up visit (respective p-values: 0.004, < 0.001, < 0.001, 0.006, < 0.001, < 0.001). CONCLUSION: IMUs were well accepted, consistent, concurrently valid, responsive and associated with unaided sitting acquisition especially for the elbow sensors. This study is the first reporting a large set of inertial sensor derived data after GT in SMA patients and paves the way for IMU-based follow-up of SMA patients after treatment.
38839888	Gene replacement therapy for spinal muscular atrophy: safety and preliminary efficacy in a Brazilian cohort.	Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a motor neuron disease associated with progressive muscle weakness, ventilatory failure, and reduced survival. Onasemnogene abeparvovec is the first gene replacement therapy (GT) approved to treat this condition. An observational retrospective study was conducted to assess adverse events and efficacy of GT in SMA patients. Forty-one patients with SMA (58.5% females and 80.1% SMA type 1) were included. The mean age at GT dosing was 18 (+-6.4) months. Thirty-six patients (87.8%) were under previous treatment with nusinersen, and 10 (24.4%) continued nusinersen after GT. Mean CHOP-INTEND increased 13 points after 6 months and this finding did not differ between groups according to nusinersen maintenance after GT (p = 0.949). Among SMA type 1 patients, 14 (46.6%) reached the ability to sit alone. Liver transaminases elevation at least two times higher than the upper limit of normal value occurred in 29 (70.7%) patients. Thrombocytopenia occurred in 13 (31.7%) patients, and one presented thrombotic microangiopathy. Older age (>2 years) was associated with more prolonged use of corticosteroids (p = 0.021). GT is effective in SMA patients, combined nusinersen after GT did not appear to add gain in motor function and older age is associated with prolonged corticosteroid use.
40074846	Considerations for repetitive intrathecal procedures in long-term nusinersen treatment for non-ambulatory spinal muscular atrophy.	Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a progressive neuromuscular disorder characterized by progressive motor function loss and skeletal muscular atrophy. Nusinersen, an antisense oligonucleotide, is the first FDA-approved therapy to achieve a significant milestone in SMA management. However, its high molecular weight requires intrathecal administration, posing challenges for clinical implementation. This study aimed to identify factors associated with postprocedural pain following repeated CT-guided transforaminal nusinersen injection in non-ambulatory patients with SMA. This single-center retrospective study evaluated 34 patients who underwent a total of 290 procedures. Postprocedural pain occurred in 49.3% of cases. Factors influencing postprocedural pain included needle angle with vertical and horizontal lines, prophylactic pain control, and number of CT scans (p < 0.05). In patients experiencing postprocedural pain, the needle angle with vertical and horizontal lines emerged as significant variables, with a beta coefficient (standard error) of 0.034 (0.011) (p < 0.05). Needle angle was an important predictor of postprocedural pain.
38483631	Taking the knife to neurodegeneration: a review of surgical gene therapy delivery to the CNS.	Gene supplementation and editing for neurodegenerative disorders has emerged in recent years as the understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying several neurodegenerative disorders increases. The most common medium to deliver genetic material to cells is via viral vectors; and with respect to the central nervous system, adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors are a popular choice. The most successful example of AAV-based gene therapy for neurodegenerative disorders is Zolgensma  which is a transformative intravenous therapy given to babies with spinal muscular atrophy. However, the field has stalled in achieving safe drug delivery to the central nervous system in adults for which treatments for disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis are desperately needed. Surgical gene therapy delivery has been proposed as a potential solution to this problem. While the field of the so-called regenerative neurosurgery has yielded pre-clinical optimism, several challenges have emerged. This review seeks to explore the field of regenerative neurosurgery with respect to AAV-based gene therapy for neurodegenerative diseases, its progress so far and the challenges that need to be overcome.
38749258	Polysomnography findings and respiratory muscle function in infants with early onset spinal muscular atrophy after gene replacement as monotherapy: A prospective study.	BACKGROUND: Gene replacement therapy (onasemnogene abeparvovec) is associated with an improvement of the prognosis of children with spinal muscular atrophy, but information on long-term respiratory outcome is scarce. The aim of this study was to report the polysomnography findings and respiratory muscle function of infants with treatment-naive spinal muscular atrophy type 1 and 2 up to 24 months after onasemnogene abeparvovec monotherapy. METHODS: A clinical and motor evaluation, respiratory muscle function testing, and polysomnography were performed repeatedly. RESULTS: Fifteen spinal muscular atrophy patients (1 presymptomatic, 7 type 1b, 6 type 1c, and 1 type 2) were included at a median age of 8.6 months (range 3.8-12.6) and followed for 24 months. The thoracic over head circumference ratio was close to normal at baseline (median 1.00 (range 0.90-1.05)) and increased significantly over time. All polysomnography and nocturnal gas exchange parameters were within normal ranges at baseline (median apnea-hypopnea index 2.5 events/hour (range 0.4-5.3)) and follow-up. The inspiratory muscle strength was normal at baseline but tended to slightly decrease over time and the expiratory muscle strength was low at any time especially for patients with recurrent respiratory infections (median (range) at baseline in cmH2O: crying esophageal pressure 54 (30-110), crying transdiaphragmatic pressure 65 (35-107), gastric pressure during maximal cough 26 (10-130), esophageal pressure during maximal cough 61 (38-150)). Only 3 patients required noninvasive ventilation. CONCLUSION: A continuous respiratory monitoring of spinal muscular atrophy patients during the first years of life following onasemnogene abeparvovec monotherapy seems recommended despite the normality of polysomnography parameters.
38980787	Design, Development, and Functional Validation of a 3D-printed Passive Upper Limb Exoskeleton.	"Motor disability in children is evident in diagnoses such as cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis, or spinal muscular atrophy, among others, due to altered movement and postural patterns. This becomes more evident as the child grows and can be treated with physical therapy. The effectiveness of early interventions in facilitating an improvement in daily life activities varies depending on the child's condition. In this context, the use of exoskeletons has emerged in recent years as a valuable resource for conducting more efficient therapy processes. This work describes the design (both structural and functional) and preliminary usability and functional validation of a 3D-printed passive upper limb exoskeleton. The goal is to provide clinicians with an efficient, low-cost device that is both easy to manufacture and assemble and, in a gamified environment, serves as an assistive device to physical therapy. The device features 5 degrees of freedom, enabling both a pro-gravity and an anti-gravity mode, controlled by a series of elastic bands. This gives rise to a dual operating mode, offering assistance or resistance to different arm, forearm, and shoulder-dependent movements. Usability validation conducted by exoskeleton users showed average results in all aspects rated above 3.8 out of 5, which implies levels of satisfaction between ""quite satisfied"" and ""very satisfied"". The analysis of metrics recorded during therapy, such as the Hand Path Ratio and Success Rate (capturing user movements using an inertial sensor in the gamified environment), as well as the range of motion, reveals quantifiable improvements which can be attributed to the use of the exoskeleton: the Hand Path Ratio tended to approach 1 throughout sessions in almost all the users, the Success Rate remained stable (as users consistently were capable of completing the assigned tasks), and the range of motion showed that all patients achieved improvements of more than 10 degrees in some of the tested movements). These functional validation processes involved the participation of 7 children with varying levels of upper limb neuro-motor impairments."
39210071	Prognostic factors for tube feeding in type I SMA patients treated with disease-modifying therapies: a cohort study.	The aim of this study was to assess the need for tube feeding in a cohort of treated infants with type I SMA and to identify predictive factors. All patients were classified at baseline, when treatment started, and at follow-up according to their functional level and the need for tube feeding. Fisher's exact test was used to examine the associations between the outcome at the last follow-up and SMA type, SMN2 copy number, and baseline nutritional status. ANOVA was performed to compare CHOP INTEND scores and age at treatment initiation with outcomes. The cohort includes 75 type I SMA infants treated between 0.1 and 5 years of age. At the last follow-up, 34 had no need for tube feeding, 9 had tube feeding but were also able to be fed by mouth, and 32 had tube feeding and were unable to be fed by mouth. Thirty of the 41 infants with tube feeding at follow-up already had feeding difficulties when treatment was started. The need for tube feeding at follow-up was associated with the level of feeding involvement at baseline and with CHOP INTEND scores [p < 0.001] but not with SMN2 copy number, SMA type 1 subtypes or age at treatment. The results of this study suggest that the need for tube feeding is not frequent in treated infants with type I SMA and, when occurring, can be predicted by the level of feeding involvement and low CHOP INTEND scores at baseline. What is Known:   The advent of disease-modifying therapies is increasingly changing the approach to swallowing and nutritional management in type I SMA.   Clinical trials and real-world data using all three disease-modifying therapies report a rather wide variability of feeding outcome and need for tube feeding that is often related to different cohorts that makes comparison between studies very difficult. What is New:   The real-world findings of this study, including all the children treated since treatments became available, confirmed that the need for tube feeding is not an invariable finding.   The level of feeding involvement at baseline appears to be a reliable prognostic indicator of bulbar outcome.   The results highlight the need for interventional studies with structured Speech and Language Therapist protocols that will help to better understand the extent to which bulbar function can be maintained or regained even in children requiring tube feeding.
38817128	Preemptive dual therapy for children at risk for infantile-onset spinal muscular atrophy.	OBJECTIVE: Compare efficacy of gene therapy alone (monotherapy) or in combination with an SMN2 augmentation agent (dual therapy) for treatment of children at risk for spinal muscular atrophy type 1. METHODS: Eighteen newborns with biallelic SMN1 deletions and two SMN2 copies were treated preemptively with monotherapy (n = 11) or dual therapy (n = 7) and followed for a median of 3 years. Primary outcomes were independent sitting and walking. Biomarkers were serial muscle ultrasonography (efficacy) and sensory action potentials (safety). RESULTS: Gene therapy was administered by 7-43 postnatal days; dual therapy with risdiplam (n = 6) or nusinersen (n = 1) was started by 15-39 days. Among 18 children enrolled, 17 sat, 15 walked, and 44% had motor delay (i.e., delay or failure to achieve prespecified milestones). Those on dual therapy sat but did not walk at an earlier age. 91% of muscle ultrasounds conducted within 60 postnatal days were normal but by 3-61 months, 94% showed echogenicity and/or fasciculation of at least one muscle group; these changes were indistinguishable between monotherapy and dual therapy cohorts. Five children with three SMN2 copies were treated with monotherapy in parallel: all sat and walked on time and had normal muscle sonograms at all time points. No child on dual therapy experienced treatment-associated adverse events. All 11 participants who completed sensory testing (including six on dual therapy) had intact sural sensory responses. INTERPRETATION: Preemptive dual therapy is well tolerated and may provide modest benefit for children at risk for severe spinal muscular atrophy but does not prevent widespread degenerative changes.
38894541	Clinical Perspectives: Treating Spinal Muscular Atrophy.	Spinal muscular atrophy is a rare and progressive neuromuscular disease that, without treatment, leads to progressive weakness and often death. A plethora of studies have led to the approval of three high-cost and effective treatments since 2016. These treatments, nusinersen, onasemnogene abeparvovec and risdiplam, have not been directly compared and have varying challenges in administration. In this review, we discuss the evidence supporting the use of these medications, the process of treatment selection, monitoring after treatment, the limited data comparing treatments, as well as future directions for investigation and therapy.
39054521	Safety analysis of laboratory parameters in paediatric patients with spinal muscular atrophy treated with nusinersen.	BACKGROUND: Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that can be treated with intrathecal nusinersen, an antisense oligonucleotide. In addition to efficacy, safety is a determining factor in the success of any therapy. Here, we aim to assess the safety of nusinersen therapy in paediatric patients with SMA. METHODS: Laboratory data of paediatric patients with SMA who received nusinersen between October 2019 and May 2022 were retrospectively analysed. RESULTS: During the observation period, 46 infants and children aged 2.9 months to 13.6 years received a total of 213 nusinersen doses without safety concerns. Inflammatory markers were stable throughout the study. International normalized ratio was increased by 0.09 per injection. Urea levels were increased by 0.108 mmol/L, and cystatin C decreased by 0.029 mg/L per injection. There were no significant changes in platelet count, activated partial thrombin time, creatinine levels or liver enzyme levels during treatment. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leukocyte count remained stable, and total protein increased by 24.038 mg/L per injection. CONCLUSION: Our data showed that nusinersen therapy is generally safe in children with SMA. Laboratory monitoring did not identify any persistent or significantly abnormal findings. CSF protein should be monitored to gain more insights.
38783003	An interpretable data-driven prediction model to anticipate scoliosis in spinal muscular atrophy in the era of (gene-) therapies.	5q-spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neuromuscular disorder (NMD) that has become one of the first 5% treatable rare diseases. The efficacy of new SMA therapies is creating a dynamic SMA patient landscape, where disease progression and scoliosis development play a central role, however, remain difficult to anticipate. New approaches to anticipate disease progression and associated sequelae will be needed to continuously provide these patients the best standard of care. Here we developed an interpretable machine learning (ML) model that can function as an assistive tool in the anticipation of SMA-associated scoliosis based on disease progression markers. We collected longitudinal data from 86 genetically confirmed SMA patients. We selected six features routinely assessed over time to train a random forest classifier. The model achieved a mean accuracy of 0.77 (SD 0.2) and an average ROC AUC of 0.85 (SD 0.17). For class 1 'scoliosis' the average precision was 0.84 (SD 0.11), recall 0.89 (SD 0.22), F1-score of 0.85 (SD 0.17), respectively. Our trained model could predict scoliosis using selected disease progression markers and was consistent with the radiological measurements. During post validation, the model could predict scoliosis in patients who were unseen during training. We also demonstrate that rare disease data sets can be wrangled to build predictive ML models. Interpretable ML models can function as assistive tools in a changing disease landscape and have the potential to democratize expertise that is otherwise clustered at specialized centers.
39910271	First-in-human study of epidural spinal cord stimulation in individuals with spinal muscular atrophy.	Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an inherited neurodegenerative disease causing motoneuron dysfunction, muscle weakness, fatigue and early mortality. Three new therapies can slow disease progression, enabling people to survive albeit with lingering motor impairments. Indeed, weakness and fatigue are still among patients' main concerns. Here we show that epidural spinal cord stimulation (SCS) improved motoneuron function, thereby increasing strength, endurance and gait quality, in three adults with type 3 SMA. Preclinical works demonstrated that SMA motoneurons show low firing rates because of a loss of excitatory input from primary sensory afferents. In the present study, we hypothesized that correcting this loss with electrical stimulation of the sensory afferents could improve motoneuron function. To test this hypothesis, we implanted three adults with SMA with epidural electrodes over the lumbosacral spinal cord, targeting sensory axons of the legs. We delivered SCS for 4 weeks, 2 h per day during motor tasks. Our intervention led to improvements in strength (up to +180%), gait quality (mean step length: +40%) and endurance (mean change in 6-minute walk test: +26 m), paralleled by increased motoneuron firing rates. These changes persisted even when SCS was turned OFF. Notably, no adverse events related to the stimulation were reported. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT05430113 .
39955912	Experience of nusinersen treatment in advanced spinal muscular atrophy type 1: Characteristics of late responders with delayed treatment efficacy.	OBJECTIVE: Little clinical data is available for advanced cases of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type 1, particularly those requiring ventilation support. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of nusinersen treatment on motor and respiratory function in advanced cases of SMA type 1. METHODS: This observational cohort study included seven patients with advanced SMA type 1, requiring permanent ventilator support and tracheostomy, at Hyogo Medical University School of Medicine Hospital between July 2017 and July 2019. The primary outcome was change in motor function, assessed using the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular Disorders (CHOP-INTEND) score. Subjective changes, which could not be measured with CHOP-INTEND, were also evaluated. The secondary outcomes included changes in respiratory function, measured by tidal volume (TV) and transcutaneous carbon dioxide (TcCO2) levels. RESULTS: Two patients showed a meaningful improvement in CHOP-INTEND scores (an increase of 4 points) after 2-3 years of nusinersen treatment. The remaining five showed changes ranging from 0 to 2 points. Subjective changes were observed in all patients. Patient respiratory function outcomes varied; TV increased in two patients and decreased in five, and TcCO2 levels decreased in three patients and increased in four. CONCLUSIONS: Nusinersen may provide meaningful improvement in motor function in some patients with advanced SMA type 1; however, treatment response may take a while and varies between individuals. Further research is needed to substantiate these findings and identify potential prognostic factors for nusinersen treatment.
39985020	Treating neuromuscular diseases: unveiling gene therapy breakthroughs and pioneering future applications.	In this review, we highlight recent advancements in adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based gene therapy for genetic neuromuscular diseases (NMDs), focusing on spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). We discuss the current FDA-approved gene therapies for NMDs and provide updates on preclinical studies that demonstrate the potential of various AAV-based gene therapies to reduce SMA severity and serve as effective treatments for DMD. Additionally, we explore the transformative impact of CRISPR/Cas9 technology on the future of gene therapy for NMDs. Despite these encouraging developments, further research is required to identify robust biomarkers that can guide treatment decisions and predict outcomes. Overall, these pioneering advancements in AAV-based gene therapy lay the groundwork for future efforts aimed at curing genetic NMDs and offer a roadmap for developing gene therapies for other neurodegenerative diseases.

39630343	Swallowing function in patients with spinal muscular atrophy before and after the introduction of new gene-based therapies: what has changed?	"OBJECTIVE: Individuals diagnosed with Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), particularly those presenting with the most severe phenotypes, have long contended with significant swallowing dysfunction. The recent emergence of efficacious advanced therapy has fundamentally altered the landscape of SMA management. By encompassing both the pre and post gene-based therapy eras within our analysis, we endeavour to elucidate the potential impact of these novel therapeutic interventions on this function. METHODS: Following the established methodology outlined by the Joanna Briggs Institute, a scoping review was conducted. This review encompassed relevant literature published up to March 2024. Two electronic databases were searched, with additional studies identified by reviewing reference lists of pertinent articles. The search strategy employed a combination of keywords including ""spinal muscular atrophy"", ""SMA"", ""swallowing"", ""feeding"", and ""nutrition"". Articles were initially screened based on title and abstract, followed by a full-text review of eligible studies published in peer-reviewed English language journals. RESULTS: The initial database search resulted in 462 articles, from which 23 studies were ultimately selected for analysis. Pre gene-based therapy studies revealed swallowing dysfunction as a prominent feature. Patients frequently reported challenges with chewing, choking on solids and liquids, and abnormal tongue movements during eating. Early dysphagia research relied on subjective measures (questionnaires, scales). objective measures like video fluoroscopic (VFSS) were rare. After gene-based therapies (GBTs), VFSS became the dominant, more objective method. Studies investigating the post-gene therapy era suggest potential clinical benefits, with trends towards improvement or stabilization of swallowing function. CONCLUSION: Pre gene-based therapy studies revealed widespread swallowing dysfunction in SMA. Conversely, the post-treatment era suggests potential improvement. Future research should prioritize identifying optimal therapies for individual swallowing function and develop validated assessments to optimize SMA management."
39241317	Clinical decision making around commercial use of gene and genetic therapies for spinal muscular atrophy.	Spinal muscular atrophy is no longer a leading cause of inherited infant death in the United States. Since 2016, three genetic therapies have been approved for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy. Each therapy has been well studied with robust data for both safety and efficacy. However, there are no head-to-head comparator studies to inform clinical decision making. Thus, treatment selection, timing, and combination therapy is largely up to clinician preference and insurance policies. As the natural history of spinal muscular atrophy continues to change, more data is needed to assist in evidence-based and cost-effective clinical decision making.
39590926	A Case Series Examining Clinic, Laboratory, and Physical Function After Administration of Nusinersen in Adults With Spinal Muscular Atrophy, a Single-Center Study.	ABSTRACT: Spinal muscular atrophy is an incurable inherited disease caused by lower motor neuron death from mutations of the survival motor neuron genes. Intrathecal therapy with the antisense oligonucleotide, nusinersen, has been demonstrated to be beneficial in children with this disease, but the experience in adults, particularly ambulatory patients, is limited. We present a prospective observational case series from a single center using nusinersen therapy where we categorize 6 adult patients with spinal muscular atrophy into 2 functional categories: ambulatory (n = 3) or nonambulatory (n = 3). All received therapy that was administered intrathecally every 4 months. We monitored the course and laboratory data for 1 year and observed for side effects. There was no significant deterioration for 1 year. There was some minor improvement particularly in subjective changes. The benefit seems to decrease after 3 months. No significant complications were observed.
38878740	Liver health in hemophilia in the era of gene therapy.	Gene therapy for hemophilia is a groundbreaking treatment approach with promising results and potential to reduce the burden of the disease. However, uncertainties remain, particularly regarding the liver side effects of AAV gene therapy, which are more common in hemophilia A. Unlike some other diseases, such as spinal muscular atrophy, where the target cell for gene therapy is different from the one affected by side effects, hemophilia gene therapy operates within the same cellular domain-the hepatocyte. This overlap is challenging and requires a targeted strategy to mitigate the risks associated with liver injury, which often requires temporary immunosuppressive therapy. A comprehensive approach is essential to increase the efficacy of gene therapy and reduce the likelihood of hepatocyte damage. Key components of this strategy include a thorough pre-gene therapy assessment of liver health, careful post-gene therapy liver monitoring, and prompt therapeutic intervention for loss of transgene expression and liver injury. Collaboration between hematologists and hepatologists is essential to ensure a well-coordinated management plan for patients undergoing hemophilia gene therapy. This review addresses the critical aspect of hepatic comorbidities in patients with hemophilia, emphasizing the need to identify and address these issues prior to initiating gene therapy. It examines the known mechanisms of liver damage and emphasizes the importance of liver monitoring after gene therapy. In addition, the review draws insights from experiences with other AAV-based gene therapies, providing valuable lessons that can guide hemophilia centers in effectively managing liver damage associated with hemophilia gene therapy.
39378752	Spinal presentations in children with spinal muscular atrophy type 1 following gene therapy treatment with onasemnogene abeparvovec - The SMA REACH UK network experience.	Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neuromuscular disorder of mainly early onset and variable severity. Prior to the introduction of disease modifying therapies (DMTs), children with SMA type 1 typically died before 2 years of age and management was primarily palliative. Onasemnogene abeparvovec (OA), nusinersen, and risdiplam are novel DMTs which ameliorate the effects of the underlying genetic defect at least partially making SMA a treatable condition. Survival and achievement of previously unmet developmental milestones result in treated SMA type 1 children spending more time upright than expected based on the natural history of the treatment-naive condition. Consequently, spinal asymmetry and kyphosis, features not typically seen in untreated SMA type 1 children due to early mortality, are increasingly common complications. Precise data regarding their prevalence, severity, and management are currently limited. This study describes the spinal features and management in 75 children with SMA type 1 who received OA between March 2021 and December 2022. Retrospective analysis from SMA REACH UK data showed that 44/75 (59 %) clinically had spinal asymmetry and 37 (49 %) had kyphosis. This study aims to raise awareness of this important feature as part of the changed natural history of SMA type 1 post OA treatment.
39341653	The health economics of cell and gene therapies.	The health economics of cell and gene therapies is complex; due to resource-intensive manufacturing, high prices are required for commercial viability that are challenging for healthcare systems to accommodate. Despite high prices, cell and gene therapies can provide value when they deliver substantial clinical benefits and displace long-term healthcare costs compared with existing treatment options. In this chapter, the cost utility approach of economic evaluation is discussed, focusing on the considerations that occur more commonly in cell and gene therapies compared to conventional medicines, how these considerations create challenges in interpreting the evidence and coming to conclusions on value, and what tools exist for understanding the level of decision uncertainty. A summary of the economic evaluation of onasemnogene abeparvovec for spinal muscular atrophy is provided as a real-world example that features the considerations discussed.
38267192	Challenges and opportunities in spinal muscular atrophy therapeutics.	Spinal muscular atrophy was the most common inherited cause of infant death until 2016, when three therapies became available: the antisense oligonucleotide nusinersen, gene replacement therapy with onasemnogene abeparvovec, and the small-molecule splicing modifier risdiplam. These drugs compensate for deficient survival motor neuron protein and have improved lifespan and quality of life in infants and children with spinal muscular atrophy. Given the lifelong implications of these innovative therapies, ways to detect and manage treatment-modified disease characteristics are needed. All three drugs are more effective when given before development of symptoms, or as early as possible in individuals who have already developed symptoms. Early subtle symptoms might be missed, and disease onset might occur in utero in severe spinal muscular atrophy subtypes; in some countries, newborn screening is allowing diagnosis soon after birth and early treatment. Adults with spinal muscular atrophy report stabilisation of disease and less fatigue with treatment. These subjective benefits need to be weighed against the high costs of the drugs to patients and health-care systems. Clinical consensus is required on therapeutic windows and on outcome measures and biomarkers that can be used to monitor drug benefit, toxicity, and treatment-modified disease characteristics.
39113515	The Impact of Nusinersen and Risdiplam on Motor Function for Spinal Muscular Atrophy Type 2 and 3: A Meta-Analysis.	Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a prevalent paediatric neuromuscular disorder characterised by muscle weakness and atrophy resulting from degeneration of spinal cord anterior horn alpha motor neurons. Gene therapy formulations exhibit varying benefits and limitations, driving the need for patient-friendly treatment options tailored to specific populations. The objective of this meta-analysis was to assess the effectiveness of gene therapy for motor function in children with SMA. The analysis encompassed a total of 719 participants from six randomised controlled trials (RCTs) conducted between 2017 and 2023. Among the studies, one demonstrated a significant and large standardised effect size (Cohen's d) favouring nusinersen in terms of Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale - Expanded (HFMSE) (d = 0.97) and revised upper limb module (RULM) (d = 0.96). Additionally, another study showed a moderate standardised effect size (Cohen's d) in favour of nusinersen concerning Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination-Section 2 (HINE-2) (d = 0.48). However, it is important to note that further research with a longer duration of observation is required to strengthen the evidence. Key Words: Spinal muscular atrophy, Nusinersen, Risdiplam, Motor function, Cohen's d.
39180957	Immune responses to central nervous system directed adeno-associated virus gene therapy: Does direct CNS delivery make a difference?	Adeno-associated virus (AAV) mediated gene therapy is a leading gene delivery platform with potential to transform the landscape of treatment for neurological disorders. While AAV is deemed non-immunogenic compared to other viral vectors, adverse immune reactions have been observed in the clinic, raising concerns. As the central nervous system (CNS) has a tightly regulated immune system, characterized by a degree of tolerance, it has been considered a unique target for AAV gene therapy. AAV vectors have shown promising results for the treatment of several CNS disorders including Spinal Muscular Atrophy, Giant Axonal Neuropathy, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Tay Sachs Disease, Parkinson's Disease, and others, demonstrating safety and success. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of Zolgensma and European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval of Upstaza, for Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) and Aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency (AADC) respectively, represent this success, all while highlighting significant differences in immune responses to AAV, particularly with regards to therapeutic administration route. AAV therapies like Upstaza that are injected directly into the immune-specialized brain have been characterized by mild immune response profiles and minor adverse events, whereas therapies like Zolgensma that are injected systemically demonstrate more robust immune stimulation and off-target toxicities. Despite these contrasting parallels, these therapeutics and others in the clinic have demonstrated clinical benefit for patients, warranting further exploration of immune responses to CNS-directed AAV clinical trials. Thus, in this review, we discuss effects of different routes of AAV administration on eliciting local and peripheral immune responses specifically observed in CNS-targeted trials.
38461122	Global Risdiplam Compassionate Use Program for Patients With Type 1 or 2 Spinal Muscular Atrophy.	PURPOSE: Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a genetic neuromuscular disease causing progressive muscle weakness and reducing life expectancy. Risdiplam (Evrysdi; Genentech/F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, Basel, Switzerland) is a drug approved for use in the treatment of patients with SMA. The ongoing global risdiplam Compassionate Use Program (CUP), initiated in November 2019, is the largest CUP in SMA, currently providing access to risdiplam for >2000 patients with type 1 or 2 SMA in 59 countries. Here, the challenges and learnings from the risdiplam CUP are presented. METHODS: Enrolled patients (aged >=2 months) had type 1 or 2 SMA and no alternative treatment options (ie, they were not medically eligible for approved SMA treatments, were unable to continue their SMA treatment due to medical reasons, were at risk for lack/loss of SMA treatment efficacy, or did not qualify for/had no access to SMA treatment within a clinical trial). Requests were made by the treating physicians via an end-to-end system. FINDINGS: The risdiplam CUP highlighted the importance of collaborating with patient advocacy groups early to learn about patients' perspectives on unmet medical needs, understanding the sometimes-unique nature of local regulations and requirements, and adapting physician- and patient-eligibility criteria. Key learnings were obtained from enrolling patients from low- to middle-income countries and from countries without dedicated Compassionate Use regulations, and from operating the CUP during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. IMPLICATIONS: The risdiplam CUP experience was successful in many ways and may help to design and implement future CUPs in rare diseases, as well as patients living in countries or in circumstances in which access to innovative treatments is a challenge.
38394831	CRISPR-Based Gene Editing Techniques in Pediatric Neurological Disorders.	The emergence of gene editing technologies offers a unique opportunity to develop mutation-specific treatments for pediatric neurological disorders. Gene editing systems can potentially alter disease trajectory by correcting dysfunctional mutations or therapeutically altering gene expression. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based approaches are attractive gene therapy platforms to personalize treatments because of their specificity, ease of design, versatility, and cost. However, many such approaches remain in the early stages of development, with ongoing efforts to optimize editing efficiency, minimize unintended off-target effects, and mitigate pathologic immune responses. Given the rapid evolution of CRISPR-based therapies, it is prudent for the clinically based child neurologist to have a conceptual understanding of what such therapies may entail, including both benefits and risks and how such therapies may be clinically applied. In this review, we describe the fundamentals of CRISPR-based therapies, discuss the opportunities and challenges that have arisen, and highlight preclinical work in several pediatric neurological diseases.
38878702	2024 update: European consensus statement on gene therapy for spinal muscular atrophy.	Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is one of the most common genetic diseases and was, until recently, a leading genetic cause of infant mortality. Three disease-modifying treatments have dramatically changed the disease trajectories and outcome for severely affected infants (SMA type 1), especially when initiated in the presymptomatic phase. One of these treatments is the adeno-associated viral vector 9 (AAV9) based gene therapy onasemnogene abeparvovec (Zolgensma ), which is delivered systemically and has been approved by the European Medicine Agency for SMA patients with up to three copies of the SMN2 gene or with the clinical presentation of SMA type 1. While this broad indication provides flexibility in patient selection, it also raises concerns about the risk-benefit ratio for patients with limited or no evidence supporting treatment. In 2020, we convened a European neuromuscular expert working group to support the rational use of onasemnogene abeparvovec, employing a modified Delphi methodology. After three years, we have assembled a similar yet larger group of European experts who assessed the emerging evidence of onasemnogene abeparvovec's role in treating older and heavier SMA patients, integrating insights from recent clinical trials and real-world evidence. This effort resulted in 12 consensus statements, with strong consensus achieved on 9 and consensus on the remaining 3, reflecting the evolving role of onasemnogene abeparvovec in treating SMA.
38851195	Living with spinal muscular atrophy while working in critical care.	
40120531	Assessing disease progression in spinal muscular atrophy, current gaps, and opportunities: a narrative review.	Spinal Muscular Atrophy is a genetic disorder causing muscle atrophy and progressive weakness. People living with the condition can have a significant heterogenous phenotype ranging from arrest of motor development to mild impairment. Assessing disease severity has been done using a range of outcome measures that can be classified by body structure or function, by activities or by participation. Functional outocome measures can be generic measures, used to compare individuals or populations against general norms, or disease-specific measures designed to fit disease characteristics. Outcome measures assessing participation are primarily used to capture patients' perceptions of health-related quality of life, daily activity abilities, caregiver burden, and the impact of physical symptoms like fatigue or pain. When assessing disease progression, often the focus on functional abilities has served as an overall indicator of change. With the appearance of disease modifying therapies and the need to evaluate the impact that they had in the course of the disease, new requirements for the existing assessments measure had appeared. The current available toolkit is able to capture a significant spectrum of both, natural history and effect of new treatments but the increased survival, changes in fatigue, bulbar function and others will benefit from further assessment.
39521528	Lumbar Transforaminal Injections of Nusinersen in Spinal Muscular Atrophy Patients.	Following a review of spinal muscular atrophy pathogenesis and current therapeutics, a comprehensive review of transforaminal lumbar injections is provided. Patient preparation, special considerations, procedural technique, complications, and alternative approaches are discussed.
39311111	Real-World Data in Children with Spinal Muscular Atrophy Type 1 on Long-Term Ventilation Receiving Gene Therapy: A Prospective Cohort Study.	Patients with spinal muscular atrophy type 1 (SMA-1) requiring invasive ventilation can be eligible for gene therapy if they tolerate at least 8 h off ventilation per day. We aimed to assess the short-term safety and efficacy of gene therapy (onasemnogene abeparvovec; Zolgensma) on respiratory function in SMA-1 patients ventilated via tracheostomy pre-gene therapy. A prospective cohort study included 22 patients. Patients were weaned off ventilation for at least 8 h daily by optimizing ventilator settings and duration, using cough augmentation, managing excessive airway secretions, enhancing nutrition, screening for respiratory bacterial colonization, and treating infections. Gene therapy was administered at a median age of 26 (Q1: 18, Q3: 43) months with a mean follow-up period of 7.64 (SD: 6.50) months. Gene therapy was safe and effective in resolving paradoxical breathing, improving cough ability, reducing airway secretions, and enhancing CHOP-INTEND scores. The clinical assessment and management implemented pre-gene therapy were effective in safely weaning patients for at least 8 h off ventilation daily. Gene therapy at a late age was safe and effective over the short-term period; however, long-term follow-up is recommended. In conjunction with gene therapy, high-quality clinical care is beneficial and should be paired with gene therapy.
40241365	[Nusinersen combined with risdiplam for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy: a case series of 10 patients and literature review].	OBJECTIVES: To explore the efficacy and adverse reactions of nusinersen combined with risdiplam in the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on the clinical data of 10 pediatric SMA patients treated with nusinersen combined with risdiplam at the Children's Medical Center of Xiangya Hospital, Central South University. RESULTS: Among the 10 SMA patients, there were 4 with type I, 4 with type II, and 2 with type III. Nine patients initially received nusinersen monotherapy, while 1 patient received nusinersen combined with risdiplam. The median duration of combination therapy with nusinersen and risdiplam for the 10 patients was 10.5 months (range: 0.5-20.0 months), with 6 patients undergoing combination therapy for more than 6 months, showing improvements in motor and/or respiratory function. The remaining 4 patients had combination treatment durations of 0.5, 1.0, 1.3, and 4.0 months, respectively, with no significant overall improvement. After combined treatment, 5 patients experienced skin hyperpigmentation, 2 had lumbar puncture site pain, 1 experienced vomiting, 1 had increased sputum production, and 1 had reduced total sleep time. All adverse reactions were mild and did not require medical intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Nusinersen combined with risdiplam demonstrates efficacy in the treatment of SMA, and no significant adverse reactions have been observed.
40140777	Administration practices of and adherence to nusinersen in children with spinal muscular atrophy: a multicenter disease registry study in China.	BACKGROUND: Nusinersen was the first approved disease modifying therapy (DMT) for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Intrathecal administration of nusinersen enables drug delivery directly to the central nervous system, where the motor neurons are located. Per the package insert, individuals with SMA receive 4 loading doses of nusinersen followed by maintenance doses every 4 months thereafter. The aim of this analysis was to investigate the administration practices of and adherence to nusinersen in Chinese children with SMA. METHODS: Data were analyzed from a longitudinal, multicenter registry enrolling children with 5q-SMA in China. Information on nusinersen administration, including administration date, care setting, use of sedation and general anesthesia, method of administration, and use of imaging guidance before administration, was collected both retrospectively and prospectively. Adherence rate was calculated at dose and participant level. A dose was considered adherent if the inter-dose interval (for dose-level) and interval from the first dose (for participant-level) followed the standard dosing regimen, with a grace period of +- 7 days for Dose 2 to 4 and +- 28 days thereafter. RESULTS: A total of 385 participants receiving nusinersen with a total of 2,415 doses were included in the study. The median (interquartile range) number of doses administered per participant was 6 (5-7). Over 99% of intrathecal injections were given in an inpatient setting. Only a few (n = 3, 0.1%) required general anesthesia, while 9% (n = 217) of doses were administered under the use of sedation. Interlaminar lumbar puncture (n = 2,407, 99.7%) was the most common method of administration, followed by cervical puncture (n = 5, 0.2%) and transforaminal lumbar puncture (n = 3, 0.1%). Over 90% of injections did not utilize any imaging guidance prior to administration, with ultrasound (n = 142, 5.9%) being the most commonly used imaging guidance. The adherence rate was 95.7% (1,943/2,030) at dose level and 81.0% (312/385) at participant level. The median inter-dose intervals aligned well with the dosing schedule, with 14 days for Doses 2 and 3, 35 days for Dose 4, and 114-124 days for maintenance doses thereafter. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from the analysis demonstrated high real-world adherence to nusinersen in Chinese children with SMA.
38365452	Invasive versus non-invasive paediatric home mechanical ventilation: review of the international evolution over the past 24 years.	BACKGROUND: Home mechanical ventilation (HMV) is the treatment for chronic hypercapnic alveolar hypoventilation. The proportion and evolution of paediatric invasive (IMV) and non-invasive (NIV) HMV across the world is unknown, as well as the disorders and age of children using HMV. METHODS: Search of Medline/PubMed for publications of paediatric surveys on HMV from 2000 to 2023. RESULTS: Data from 32 international reports, representing 8815 children (59% boys) using HMV, were analysed. A substantial number of children had neuromuscular disorders (NMD; 37%), followed by cardiorespiratory (Cardio-Resp; 16%), central nervous system (CNS; 16%), upper airway (UA; 13%), other disorders (Others; 10%), central hypoventilation (4%), thoracic (3%) and genetic/congenital disorders (Gen/Cong; 1%). Mean age+-SD (range) at HMV initiation was 6.7+-3.7 (0.5-14.7) years. Age distribution was bimodal, with two peaks around 1-2 and 14-15 years. The number and proportion of children using NIV was significantly greater than that of children using IMV (n=6362 vs 2453, p=0.03; 72% vs 28%, p=0.048), with wide variations among countries, studies and disorders. NIV was used preferentially in the preponderance of children affected by UA, Gen/Cong, Thoracic, NMD and Cardio-Resp disorders. Children with NMD still receiving primary invasive HMV were mainly type I spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Mean age+-SD at initiation of IMV and NIV was 3.3+-3.3 and 8.2+-4.4 years (p<0.01), respectively. The rate of children receiving additional daytime HMV was higher with IMV as compared with NIV (69% vs 10%, p<0.001). The evolution of paediatric HMV over the last two decades consists of a growing number of children using HMV, in parallel to an increasing use of NIV in recent years (2020-2023). There is no clear trend in the profile of children over time (age at HMV). However, an increasing number of patients requiring HMV were observed in the Gen/Cong, CNS and Others groups. Finally, the estimated prevalence of paediatric HMV was calculated at 7.4/100 000 children. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with NMD represent the largest group of children using HMV. NIV is increasingly favoured in recent years, but IMV is still a prevalent intervention in young children, particularly in countries indicating less experience with NIV.
39363429	Recent Advance in Disease Modifying Therapies for Spinal Muscular Atrophy.	Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive motor neuron disease characterized by progressive weakness and atrophy of skeletal muscles. With homozygous survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene mutation, all SMA patients have at least one copy of the SMN2 gene, which provides an opportunity for drug targeting to enhance SMN expression. Current three disease modifying drugs, including nusinersen, onasemnogene abeparvovec, and risdiplam, have demonstrated impressive effectiveness in SMA treatment. Nusinersen is an antisense oligonucleotide targeting SMN2 pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) to modify alternative splicing and is effective in SMA children and adults, administrating via intermittent intrathecal injection. Onasemnogene abeparvovec is an adeno-associated viral vector carrying human SMN1 gene, featuring intravenous injection once in a lifetime for SMA patients less than 2 years of the age. Risdiplam is a small molecule also targeting SMN2 pre-mRNA and is effective in SMA children and adults with administration via oral intake once per day. Patients with SMA should receive these disease modifying therapies as soon as possible to not only stabilize disease progression, but potentially obtain neurological improvement. The development in these therapies has benefited patients with SMA and will potentially provide insight in future drug discovery for other neurodegenerative diseases. Keywords: Adeno-associated viral vector, antisense oligonucleotide, disease modifying therapy, gene therapy, motor neuron disease, spinal muscular atrophy.
38306058	Repeated AAV9 Titer Determination in a Presymptomatic SMA Patient with Three SMN2 Gene Copies - A Case Report.	Adeno-associated viruses (AAV) are well-suited to serve as gene transfer vectors. Onasemnogene abeparvovec uses AAV9 as virus vector. Previous exposure to wild-type AAVs or placental transfer of maternal AAV antibodies, however, can trigger an immune response to the vector virus which may limit the therapeutic effectiveness of gene transfer and impact safety. We present the case of a female patient with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and three survival motor neuron 2 (SMN2) gene copies. The infant had elevated titers of AAV9 antibodies at diagnosis at 9 days of age. Being presymptomatic at diagnosis, it was decided to retest the patient's AAV9 antibody titer at two-weekly intervals. Six weeks after initial diagnosis, a titer of 1:12.5 allowed treatment with onasemnogene abeparvovec. The presented case demonstrates that, provided the number of SMN2 gene copies and the absence of symptoms allow, onasemnogene abeparvovec therapy is feasible in patients with initially exclusionary AAV9 antibody titers of >1:50.
39087519	Onasemnogene abeparvovec gene therapy for spinal muscular atrophy: A cohort study from the United Arab Emirates.	INTRODUCTION/AIMS: Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) manifests with progressive motor neuron degeneration, leading to muscle weakness. Onasemnogene abeparvovec is a US Food and Drug Administration-approved gene replacement therapy for SMA. This study aimed to present short-term data of children in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) treated with onasemnogene abeparvovec, particularly in the context of children requiring invasive ventilatory support via tracheostomy. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on 60 children who received onasemnogene abeparvovec. All these children received corticosteroids. They were followed up for up to 3 months. Motor function assessments were performed before and after the gene therapy. Comprehensive clinical evaluations, including pulmonary functions, were performed at baseline and the 3-month mark. RESULTS: Forty-three percent were male, and the mean age at the time of infusion was 29.6 months (SD +- 17.2). The mean weight was 10.1 kg (SD 2.6). All children demonstrated marked improvements in motor function within 3 months of gene therapy administration. No adverse effects attributable to corticosteroid therapy were observed. Positive clinical outcomes, including increased ventilator-free intervals, reduced antibiotic dependency, and fewer hospital admissions, were reported among children with invasive ventilation via tracheostomy. DISCUSSION: This study demonstrates the favorable tolerability and promising responses to onasemnogene abeparvovec in invasively ventilated pediatric patients. Early improvements in motor function, as observed within 3 months post-treatment, suggest its potential as a viable therapeutic option for this vulnerable patient population.
38902631	Improvement in functional motor scores in patients with non-ambulatory spinal muscle atrophy during Nusinersen treatment in South Korea: a single center study.	We analyzed the changes in various motor function scores over a four-year period in patients with non-ambulatory spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) during Nusinersen treatment. Patients underwent Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (HINE) or Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE) before treatment, and approximately every 4 months thereafter. Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular Disorders (CHOP INTEND) or Children's Hospital of Philadelphia - Adult Test of Neuromuscular Disorders (CHOP ATEND), Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM), and Motor Function Measure (MFM) were performed based on baseline functional status. Narrative interviews were conducted to explore post-treatment physical improvement regarding activities of daily living (ADLs) and fatigue after ADLs. Based on HFMSE results, 9 patients achieved minimum clinically important differences. Average rates of change (slopes) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals for all assessment tools were in a positive direction. CHOP-INTEND showed the most prominent improvement in children and adolescents followed by HFMSE. Improvements in CHOP-ATEND were most noticeable in adults. Improvements were accompanied by changes in ADLs as observed in the narrative interviews. It is necessary to consider various functional aspects to determine the effectiveness of Nusinersen therapy. The objective assessment of the therapeutic effect of Nusinersen in non-ambulatory SMA requires consideration of functional aspects and the related ADLs.
38457958	Vaccination proposal for patients on onasemnogene abeparvovec therapy.	The approval of disease-modifying treatment in spinal muscular atrophy made the condition less severe. The course of the disease changed, but some new concerns occurred with the different new therapies. The side effects of onasemnogene aboparvovec therapy can raise differential diagnostic challenges and necessitate immune therapy, leading to immunosuppression affecting response to vaccines. We provide a pretherapy screening proposal from an infectological point of view separately for newborns treated presymptomatically and children diagnosed with symptoms at any age. Furthermore, we summarise the guidelines on the vaccination before, during, and after immune therapy (steroids) in onasemnogene aboparvovec-treated patients.
39509253	Treatment of spinal muscular atrophy.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The aim of the review was to provide an overview of safety and efficacy of the available treatments including information from both clinical trials and real-world data. Additional information form ongoing studies using other approaches than increasing SMN protein are also reported. RECENT FINDINGS: In the last 3 years, there have been over 24 studies reporting safety and the impact of the available drugs on different aspects of function, including respiratory and bulbar function. These findings, obtained in a real-world setting, are extremely important to define the spectrum of responses in individuals with different age, weight, SMN2 copies, and other variables and will be of help to the families and the clinicians to set up the right expectations at the time of starting a new treatment. SUMMARY: The large number of studies that became available in the last few years support and expand the information on safety and efficacy provided by the clinical trials.
38642267	Healthcare resource utilisation and direct medical cost for individuals with 5q spinal muscular atrophy in Sweden.	BACKGROUND: Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a rare, progressive, neuromuscular disorder. Recent advances in treatment require an updated assessment of burden to inform reimbursement decisions. OBJECTIVES: To quantify healthcare resource utilisation (HCRU) and cost of care for patients with SMA. METHODS: Cohort study of patients with SMA identified in the Swedish National Patient Registry (2007-2018), matched to a reference cohort grouped into four SMA types (1, 2, 3, unspecified adult onset [UAO]). HCRU included inpatient admissions, outpatient visits, procedures, and dispensed medications. Direct medical costs were estimated by multiplying HCRU by respective unit costs. Average annual HCRU and medical costs were modelled for SMA versus reference cohorts to estimate differences attributable to the disease (i.e., average treatment effect estimand). The trajectory of direct costs over time were assessed using synthetic cohorts. RESULTS: We identified 290 SMA patients. Annualised HCRU was higher in SMA patients compared with reference cohorts. Highest risk ratios were observed for inpatient overnight stays for type 1 (risk ratio [RR]: 29.2; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 16.0, 53.5) and type 2 (RR: 23.3; 95% CI: 16.4,33.1). Mean annual direct medical costs per patient for each year since first diagnosis were greatest for type 1 ($114,185 and SMA-attributable: $113,380), type 2 ($61,876 and SMA-attributable: $61,237), type 3 ($45,518 and SMA-attributable: $44,556), and UAO ($4046 and SMA-attributable: $2098). Costs were greatest in the 2-3 years after the first diagnosis for all types. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The economic burden attributable to SMA is significant. Further research is needed to understand the burden in other European countries and the impact of new treatments.
39246033	Ultrasound assisted versus landmark based intrathecal administration of nusinersen in adults with spinal muscular atrophy disease: A randomized trial.	INTRODUCTION/AIMS: Nusinersen intrathecal administration can be challenging in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) adults. We aimed to determine if the ultrasound (US)-assistance reduces the number of needle attempts and needle redirections needed for intrathecal drug administration and its impact on the procedure time, the incidence of adverse events (AEs), and patient satisfaction in these patients. METHODS: Fifty-eight patients aged 18 years and older scheduled for intrathecal nusinersen injection were enrolled and randomized (1:1 ratio) into Group 1 (nusinersen infusion with US-assisted technique) or Group 2 (nusinersen infusion with landmark-based technique). The number of attempts, number of redirections, periprocedural time, AEs and patient satisfaction were reported. Continuous variables were compared with the Student t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum test. Categorical variables were evaluated with the Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test in case of expected frequencies <5. The p-values <.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: There were no statistical differences in the number of attempts, AEs, or patient satisfaction between the two groups. The number of needle redirections was significantly lower in the ultrasound group versus landmark-based group (p < .05) in both the overall group of patients and in the subgroup with difficult spines. The periprocedural time was about 40 seconds longer in US-group versus landmark-based group (p < .05). DISCUSSION: In SMA adults, US assistance reduces the number of needle redirections needed for intrathecal drug administration. These results suggest that the US assistance may be advantageous for nusinersen therapy to reduce the therapeutic burden of intrathecal infusion.
39961029	Therapeutic Scoliosis-Specific Exercises for a Child With Spinal Muscular Atrophy: A Case Report.	PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to report on therapeutic scoliosis-specific exercises (PSSE) for a child with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) who had spinal fusion. METHODS: PSSE were recommended after scoliosis was diagnosed and exercises focused on posture and improving strength preoperatively and restoring function postoperatively. RESULTS: Gross motor function remained stable before spinal fusion, briefly decreased after the procedure, and then stabilized post-surgery. Distance walked on the 6-minute walk test decreased post-surgery but improved after the addition of PSSE to the Standard of Care. CONCLUSIONS: Including PSSE as an adjunct to traditional interventions may be beneficial for children with SMA. Evidence supports incorporating PSSE to improve posture preoperatively in idiopathic scoliosis. Its use postoperatively and in children with SMA is not well studied. Controlled studies are needed to understand the impact of pre- and post-op PSSE in children with SMA.
38772209	Cognitive function in SMA patients with 2 or 3 SMN2 copies treated with SMN-modifying or gene addition therapy during the first year of life.	BACKGROUND: Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neuromuscular disease, causing progressive muscle weakness due to loss of lower motoneurons. Since 2017, three therapies, two modifying gene transcription and one adding the defective gene, have been approved with comparable efficacy on motor outcome. Data on cognitive outcomes of treated SMA type 1 patients is limited. The aim of this study was to evaluate cognitive function in symptomatic and presymptomatic SMA type 1 patients with two or three SMN2 copies who received SMN-modifying or gene-addition therapy in the first year of life. METHODS: Cognitive testing was performed in 20 patients, including 19 symptomatic SMA type 1 patients with up to three SMN2 copies and 1 pre-symptomatically treated patient. Children were tested using Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID-III) at the age of 2 or 3 years or the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPSII-IV) at the of age of 5 years. RESULTS: 11/20 patients showed subnormal cognitive development. Boys had significantly lower cognitive scores. Patients requiring assisted ventilation or feeding support were more likely to have cognitive deficits. Achieving more motor milestones was associated with a better cognitive outcome. CONCLUSION: Treated patients with SMA type 1 have heterogeneous cognitive function with 55 % of patients showing deficits. Risk factors for cognitive impairment in our cohort were male gender and need for assisted ventilation or feeding support. Therefore, cognitive assessment should be included in the standard of care to allow early identification of deficits and potential therapeutic interventions.
39333302	Onasemnogene Abeparvovec Gene Therapy and Risdiplam for the Treatment of Spinal Muscular Atrophy in Thailand: A Cost-Utility Analysis.	OBJECTIVES: Caring for individuals with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a rare genetic disorder, poses tremendous challenges for the economy and healthcare system. This study evaluated the cost-utility of onasemnogene abeparvovec-xioi gene therapy and risdiplam for SMA in Thailand. METHODS: A Markov model was used to analyze the lifetime costs and outcomes of these treatments compared with standard of care for symptomatic SMA types 1 and 2-3. SMA type 1 patients were treated with one of either onasemnogene or risdiplam, while SMA types 2-3 patients received risdiplam. Data on disease progression and medical costs were sourced from hospital databases, while treatment efficacy was based on clinical trials. Interviews with patients and caregivers provided data on non-medical costs and utilities. Base case cost-effectiveness and sensitivity analyses were conducted, with the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) calculated in US dollars (USD) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained, against a willingness-to-pay threshold of 4444 USD/QALY gained. RESULTS: For SMA type 1, the ICERs for onasemnogene and risdiplam were 163,102 and 158,357 USD/QALY gained, respectively. For SMA types 2-3, the ICER for risdiplam was 496,704 USD/QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: While onasemnogene and risdiplam exceeded the value-for-money threshold of the Thai healthcare system, they yielded the highest QALY gains among all approved medications. Policy-makers should incorporate various pieces of evidence alongside the cost-effectiveness results for rare diseases with costly drugs. Additionally, cost-effectiveness findings are useful for price negotiations and alternative financial funding, which allows policy-makers to seek solutions to ensure patient access, aligning with universal health coverage principles in Thailand.
39755539	Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis after intrathecal administration of nusinersen.	Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis is an uncommon sequela of low intracranial pressure, which may result from a lumbar puncture (LP). We describe a case of a patient in their 40s presenting with 48 hours of persistent headache following intrathecal administration of nusinersen for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type 3. There were no focal neurological signs or symptoms apart from baseline symmetrical proximal limb weakness attributed to SMA. Initial investigations revealed radiological evidence of an acute cerebral venous sinus thrombus (CVST). The patient was promptly started on anticoagulation. Partial recanalisation was seen as soon as 48 hours after commencement of anticoagulation, with almost full resolution of the thrombus at follow-up in 2 months. Awareness of CVST as a potential complication of intrathecal therapies and diagnostic LP allows for early identification, management and prevention of serious neurological consequences.
39625559	Respiratory outcomes of onasemnogene abeparvovec treatment for spinal muscular atrophy: national real-world cohort study.	Onasemnogene abeparvovec (OA) is a novel gene replacement therapy for patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). This study provides real-world respiratory data for pediatric SMA patients receiving OA who were assessed before and one year after treatment in a multicenter cohort study conducted from 2019 to 2021. Twenty-five OA-treated SMA patients (23 with type 1 and 2 with type 2; median age at treatment 6.1 months, with a range of 0.36-23 months) were included. Sixteen were treatment-naive, and nine had received various prior treatments. Two patients died due to respiratory failure during the study period. Of the remaining 23 patients, four were put on non-invasive ventilation (NIV), bringing ventilated patients to a total of ten during the post-treatment year. Three patients required permanent NIV support, while 13 did not require any respiratory support. Ventilation time decreased from 14.3 to 11.1 hours per day, and respiratory hospitalizations decreased by 26% (from 0.76 to 0.57 per life year). Fifteen of the 23 patients maintained full oral nutrition at study closure compared to 20 of the 25 at study initiation. This real-world data analysis demonstrates that OA may improve respiratory outcomes in SMA patients. Importantly, compounding factors, such as age at treatment initiation, treatment combinations, and natural history, may influence the respiratory course, thus highlighting the need for standardized long-term management. What is Known:   Respiratory failure is a leading cause of mortality in untreated spinal muscular atrophy type 1 patients.   Onasemnogene abeparvovec (OA) improves neurological outcomes, but real-world respiratory data are limited. What is New:   Our real-world analysis suggests OA may improve respiratory outcomes.   Age at treatment and treatment combinations may also influence respiratory trajectory.
39829133	Safety and Efficacy of Nusinersen Focusing on Renal and Hematological Parameters in Spinal Muscular Atrophy.	BACKGROUND: Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a motor neuron disease caused by mutations in the SMN1 gene. Nusinersen, an antisense oligonucleotide, has been shown to improve motor function in SMA patients. However, concerns regarding its renal safety remain as previous studies have linked similar treatments to renal toxicity. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of the nusinersen treatment on platelet counts and renal functions, specifically urine protein excretion, in SMA patients and to estimate safe urinary protein levels before administration of each intrathecal injection. METHODS: This retrospective study examined data from 33 patients with SMA to assess the effects of nusinersen on motor functions and laboratory parameters including platelet count, serum creatinine, urine protein, and urine creatinine. Measurements were taken at baseline andprior to each maintenance dose, after the completion of four initial loading doses. The baseline values were compared between SMA Type 1 and Type 2 patients, while the changes in these values over time were analyzed within each group. RESULTS: No significant adverse effects on platelet counts or renal functions were observed. Urine creatinine and protein levels were significantly higher in SMA Type 2 patients compared to SMA Type 1 at baseline; these parameters remained stable in SMA Type 2 but increased significantly after the loading doses in SMA Type 1. Motor function improvements were observed in both groups, with the most significant gains in SMA Type 1 after the loading doses. Thus, improvement in motor functions was associated with increase in urine creatinine. CONCLUSION: Nusinersen treatment did not cause significant renal toxicity or affect platelet counts. Urine creatinine levels may serve as a potential biomarker for assessing treatment response in SMA Type 1.
39192445	[Effect of disease-modifying drugs for spinal muscular atrophy on the ventilation support of type 1 children].	Objective: To summarize the effects of disease-modifying drugs for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) on the ventilation support of type 1 children after acute respiratory failure. Methods: A case-control study was conducted, including the data of clinical characteristics, medication and ventilation supports of 38 SMA patients of type 1 with pneumonia and acute respiratory failure hospitalized in Children's Hospital Affiliated to Capital Institute of Pediatrics from January 2020 to July 2023. Children were divided into the treatment group and the untreated group based on whether they started and persisted in using Nusinersen or Risdiplam or not before hospitalization. The differences of ventilation support between the 2 groups were analyzed. The children of the treatment group were divided into the improved group and the unimproved group based on whether they could be avoid of prolonged dependence on continuous mechanical ventilation in the next six months after discharge. The differences in clinical characteristics between the two groups were analyzed. T-test and chi2 test were used for comparison. Results: Among the enrolled children, 19 were male and 19 were female. The age was 1.3 (0.6, 2.0) years at the time of hospitalization due to pneumonia. There were 26 cases in the treatment group and 12 cases in the untreated group. The treatment group had a higher proportion of patients without prolonged dependence on continuous mechanical ventilation in the next six months after discharge (69% (18/26) vs. 2/12, chi2=9.10, P<0.05). Eighteen children were improved among the treated group, while 8 children were not. The improved group had a larger age of first onset of acute respiratory failure (1.6 (0.4, 3.4) vs. 0.5 (0.3, 0.7) years, Z=2.07, P<0.05), a longer duration of medication taken before hospitalization (3.6 (2.4, 8.7) vs. 1.2 (1.2, 2.4) months, t=2.74, P<0.05), and a smaller proportion with underlying diseases (1/18 vs. 6/8, chi2=13.58, P<0.05). Conclusions: SMA disease-modifying drugs are useful for type 1 children to avoid of prolonged dependence on continuous mechanical ventilation after acute respiratory failure. The patients who take medication longer, or have acute respiratory failure for the first-time at an older age, or without underlying diseases are more likely to avoid of.
39062637	Integrated Approaches and Practical Recommendations in Patient Care Identified with 5q Spinal Muscular Atrophy through Newborn Screening.	In recent years, significant progress has been made in 5q Spinal Muscular Atrophy therapeutics, emphasizing the importance of early diagnosis and intervention for better clinical outcomes. Characterized by spinal cord motor neuron degeneration, 5q-SMA leads to muscle weakness, swallowing difficulties, respiratory insufficiency, and skeletal deformities. Recognizing the pre-symptomatic phases supported by screening and confirmatory genetic tests is crucial for early diagnosis. This work addresses key considerations in implementing 5q-SMA screening within the Brazilian National Newborn Screening Program and explores Brazil's unique challenges and opportunities, including genetic tests, time-to-patient referral to specialized centers, program follow-up, and treatment algorithms. We aim to guide healthcare professionals and policymakers, facilitating global discussions, including Latin American countries, and knowledge-sharing on this critical subject to improve the care for newborns identified with 5q SMA.
39202360	Recent Progress in Gene-Targeting Therapies for Spinal Muscular Atrophy: Promises and Challenges.	Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a severe genetic disorder characterized by the loss of motor neurons, leading to progressive muscle weakness, loss of mobility, and respiratory complications. In its most severe forms, SMA can result in death within the first two years of life if untreated. The condition arises from mutations in the SMN1 (survival of motor neuron 1) gene, causing a deficiency in the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. Humans possess a near-identical gene, SMN2, which modifies disease severity and is a primary target for therapies. Recent therapeutic advancements include antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), small molecules targeting SMN2, and virus-mediated gene replacement therapy delivering a functional copy of SMN1. Additionally, recognizing SMA's broader phenotype involving multiple organs has led to the development of SMN-independent therapies. Evidence now indicates that SMA affects multiple organ systems, suggesting the need for SMN-independent treatments along with SMN-targeting therapies. No single therapy can cure SMA; thus, combination therapies may be essential for comprehensive treatment. This review addresses the SMA etiology, the role of SMN, and provides an overview of the rapidly evolving therapeutic landscape, highlighting current achievements and future directions.
39794178	Pushing the boundaries: future directions in the management of spinal muscular atrophy.	Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a devastating, degenerative, paediatric neuromuscular disease which until recently was untreatable. Discovery of the responsible gene 30 years ago heralded a new age of pioneering therapeutic developments. Three disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) have received regulatory approval and have transformed the disease, reducing disability and prolonging patient survival. These therapies - with distinct mechanisms, routes of administration, dosing schedules, side effect profiles, and financial costs - have dramatically altered the clinical phenotypes of this condition and have presented fresh challenges for patient care. In this review article we discuss potential strategies to maximise clinical outcomes through early diagnosis and treatment, optimised dosing, use of therapeutic combinations and state-of-the-art physiotherapy techniques, and the development of innovative therapies targeting alternative mechanisms.
39497486	Delayed Diagnosis of Spinal Muscular Atrophy in Two Chinese Families due to Novel SMN1 Deletions.	Autosomal recessive spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a leading cause of infant and child mortality, with homozygous deletion in exon 7 of the SMN1 gene being a major genetic cause. However, routine genetic testing methods may overlook structural variants outside of exon 7, potentially leading to misdiagnosis of SMA patients. Here, we reported two Chinese SMA patients who primarily exhibited developmental delays. Physical examinations revealed markedly reduced muscle strength and tone in their extremities, and electromyography suggested extensive neurogenic damage in the anterior horn of the spinal cord. The MLPA results indicated a single copy number of SMN1 in both patients, which is inconsistent with the typical genetic pattern of SMA. Through RNA sequencing and ultra-long read sequencing, we ultimately identified a rare structural variant involving the deletion of exons 2a-5 in both unrelated patients. This confirmed the presence of compound heterozygous variants in the SMN1 gene as the actual genetic cause. To our knowledge, this is the first case where a combination of RNA sequencing and ultra-long read sequencing has been used to diagnose SMA. We demonstrated the significant value of RNA sequencing in cases where children are highly suspected of having SMA but present negative results in routine genetic testing. This underscores the crucial role of accurate genetic testing methods in achieving early diagnosis of SMA.
39463279	Impact of respiratory tract infections on spinal muscular atrophy with focus on respiratory syncytial virus infections: a single-centre cohort study.	"AIMS OF THE STUDY: Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a degenerative neuromuscular disorder leading to muscle hypotonia, weakness, and respiratory and bulbar impairment. Infants with SMA have an increased risk of respiratory tract infections (RTI) including severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections. Therefore, guidelines for the treatment of SMA recommend RSV prophylaxis with palivizumab for patients aged below two years who have compromised motor functions (""non-sitters""). Since palivizumab is not approved for RSV prophylaxis in SMA patients in Switzerland, payers usually do not grant cost approvals for this indication. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the frequency of severe RTI among SMA patients focusing on RSV infections requiring hospital treatment and to determine the long-term impact of RSV infections on the natural history of SMA. METHODS: A single-centre cohort study at the tertiary paediatric Neuromuscular Centre Zurich, Switzerland, including data of SMA patients with a genetic-based therapy initiated below two years of age between May 2019 and December 2022. All hospitalisations were analysed with a focus on severe RTI and especially RSV infections, and their impact on nutritional and respiratory function. The costs of inpatient treatment of RSV infections were determined and compared with estimated expenses for RSV prophylaxis with palivizumab. RESULTS: 12 SMA patients (median age at treatment initiation: 3.5 months, range: 0-17 months) were followed for a cumulative period of 25.75 years (7 SMA type 1; 5 SMA type 2 including one presymptomatic individual). With an incidence rate of 2.34 per patient-year, the risk of severe RTI was especially high in SMA type 1 (versus 0.1 in SMA type 2, p = 0.044). A total of 37 hospitalisations (279 hospital days) was necessary for the treatment of RTI in general; 9 of them were attributed to RSV infections (in 5 SMA type 1 patients; 84 hospital days). Only 3/12 SMA patients had received seasonal RSV prophylaxis with palivizumab. No RSV infections requiring hospital treatment occurred in patients while receiving seasonal RSV prophylaxis. During RTI, nutritional support had to be commonly initiated and continued after discharge. In 3/7 SMA type 1 patients, non-invasive ventilation was started during acute treatment for RTI and continued to the end of follow-up. CONCLUSION: We observed a high risk of RTI, especially RSV infections, among young SMA patients. Failure to adhere to established care protocols, for example by omitting RSV prophylaxis, may be linked to a heightened risk of morbidity in these children."
