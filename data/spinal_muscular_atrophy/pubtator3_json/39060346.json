The study employed a combination of signal quantification techniques, including the Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR), Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR), Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN), and Multi-item Gamma Poisson Shrinker (MGPS), to enhance the accuracy of signal detection and reduce the risk of false positives or negatives. Between the first quarter of 2017 and the third quarter of 2023, the FAERS database collected a total of 11,485,105 drug AE reports, of which 5772 were related to Nusinersen. Through signal mining analysis, 218 preferred term (PT) signals involving 27 system organ classes (SOCs) were identified. The study discovered AEs related to metabolism and nutrition disorders, psychiatric disorders, and cardiac disorders SOCs, which were not mentioned in the product information. Additionally, complications directly related to the intrathecal administration of Nusinersen, such as increased CSF pressure, positive CSF red blood cell count, and AEs related to the method of drug use, such as neuromuscular scoliosis and cerebrospinal fluid reservoir placement, were highlighted. Notably, AEs related to renal function abnormalities, such as abnormal Urine protein/creatinine ratio and protein urine presence, showed higher frequency and signal strength. The findings of this study emphasize the importance of comprehensive safety monitoring in the clinical application of Nusinersen. These results are significant for guiding future clinical practices, improving disease management strategies, and developing safer treatment protocols.",
