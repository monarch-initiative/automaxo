Gene therapy formulations exhibit varying benefits and limitations, driving the need for patient-friendly treatment options tailored to specific populations. The objective of this meta-analysis was to assess the effectiveness of gene therapy for motor function in children with SMA. The analysis encompassed a total of 719 participants from six randomised controlled trials (RCTs) conducted between 2017 and 2023. Among the studies, one demonstrated a significant and large standardised effect size (Cohen's d) favouring nusinersen in terms of Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale - Expanded (HFMSE) (d = 0.97) and revised upper limb module (RULM) (d = 0.96). Additionally, another study showed a moderate standardised effect size (Cohen's d) in favour of nusinersen concerning Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination-Section 2 (HINE-2) (d = 0.48). However, it is important to note that further research with a longer duration of observation is required to strengthen the evidence. Key Words: Spinal muscular atrophy, Nusinersen, Risdiplam, Motor function, Cohen's d.",
