                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Impaired glycemic control and the subsequent development of Cystic fibrosis Related Diabetes (CFRD) are prevalent complications, affecting up to 50% of adults with cystic fibrosis (CF). CFTR modulator (CFTRm) therapies improve pulmonary functions, reduce exacerbation rates, increase survival in people with CF (pwCF) and appear to have a positive effect on extrapulmonary manifestations, such as nutritional state, improvements in upper respiratory symptoms, and quality of life. Initial findings indicate that CFTRm may have a positive impact on short-term glycemic control; however, long-term effects remain uncertain at present. METHODS: In this retrospective study, data were collected and analyzed on 15 pwCF, ages 13-37 years, started on CFTRm therapy. Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) results were compared pre- and post-CFTRm therapy. RESULTS: The 120-minute OGTT value decreased from 159.7 to 130.4 post-CFTRm (p = 0.047). The average time elapsed between the two OGTT tests was 49.87 months (ranging 9-157 months, median 38 months). Glycemic status improved in six pwCF (two CFRD to normal (NGT)/indeterminate (INDET) glucose tolerance; two impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) to INDET; two INDET to NGT) and worsened in one (IGT to CFRD). Six pwCF and NGT remained stable with no changes in glycemic statues throughout the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: CFTRm therapy may decelerate the glycemic control deterioration in pwCF over an extended period. These findings indicate the need for periodic OGTTs following the initiation of CFTRm therapy to appropriately adjust insulin requirements and prevent hypoglycemia. Further larger cohorts are required to authenticate and substantiate these findings.",

This triple drug is currently not indicated in liver transplant patients, as clinical trials including subjects with previous solid organ transplantation are lacking. CASE PRESENTATION: We report on a liver transplant girl with CF-related advanced pulmonary disease meeting clinical criteria for lung transplant, who started the triple modulator because she could not get on the lung transplant waiting list due to psycho-social motivations. Since initiation of ETI therapy, she has experienced a significant improvement in respiratory function and quality of life, without adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: This case shows that ETI therapy can represent a lifesaving drug for individuals without alternatives, even in liver transplant patients. The clinical benefits of the modulator overcome risks, which may be limited with a close drug monitoring of immunosuppressants serum levels and functional liver tests.",

Despite significant progress in developing CF transmembrane conductance regulator-specific treatments for CF lung disease, exploring alternative CF-targeted medications seems reasonable. We sought to evaluate the potential beneficial effects of oral benzbromarone as an adjuvant therapy in CF patients with reduced lung function. METHODS: This was a prospective open-label pilot study of oral benzbromarone (100 mg/day) administered once daily for 90 days. Patients were followed at a tertiary referral center in southern Brazil. Safety was assessed by the number of reported adverse events. Secondary objectives included percent predicted FEV1 (FEV1%) and pulmonary exacerbations. RESULTS: Ten patients were enrolled. Benzbromarone was found to be safe, with no serious drug-related adverse events. Eight patients completed the study; the median relative change in FEV1% tended to increase during the treatment, showing an 8% increase from baseline at the final visit. However, a nonparametric test showed that the change was not significant (p = 0.06). Of a total of ten patients, only one experienced at least one pulmonary exacerbation during the study. CONCLUSIONS: Oral benzbromarone appears to be safe, and improved FEV1% has been observed in patients with CF. Further assessment in larger trials is warranted to elucidate whether oral benzbromarone can be a potential adjuvant therapy for CF.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Approximately 85% of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) have exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) with 10% requiring supplemental nighttime enteral tube feedings. Administration of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) with nighttime feedings is fraught with challenges. RELiZORB (Alcresta Therapeutics, Inc), an in-line lipase cartridge, delivers PERT continuously with enteral feedings. Outcomes related to the use of this in-line lipase cartridge are lesser known. This project evaluated anthropometrics related to in-line lipase cartridge use among pediatric patients with CF already receiving oral PERT therapy prior to nighttime enteral feedings. METHODS: Retrospective chart review was performed on 29 patients with CF and EPI receiving supplemental tube feedings and utilizing in-line lipase cartridge for a continuous 12 month period between 2015 and 2019. Anthropometrics were evaluated 12 months before and after initiation of in-line lipase cartridge. RESULTS: Compared with mean height z score at 6-months pre-in-line lipase cartridge, mean height z score at 6-months post-in-line-lipase cartridge (adjusted mean difference [AMD] = 0.2540; 95% CI = [0.0487, 0.4592]; P = 0.0153) and mean height z score at 12-months post-in-line lipase cartridge (AMD = 0.2684; 95% CI = [0.0203, 0.5166]; P = 0.0340) were significantly higher. Mean weight z score at 12-months post-in-line-lipase-cartridge neared statistical significance compared with 6-months pre-in-line lipase cartridge (AMD = 0.2816; 95% CI = [-0.0003, 0.5634]; P = 0.0502) when excluding seven patients with advanced lung disease (forced expiratory volume in the first second of expiration of 40%). Weight-for-length or body mass index did not significantly differ compared with pre-in-line lipase cartridge. CONCLUSION: Use of in-line lipase cartridge with enteral feeds improved anthropometrics, especially height, in pediatric patients with CF.",

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the effect of telehealth-based exercise training using different modalities (combined exercise training group, CombG, core stabilization exercise group, SG), in comparison with control group (CG), on exercise capacity, oxidative stress, and irisin in children with CF. METHODS: Thirty-nine children with CF (mean age=11.41+-2.18 years, mean FEV1(z-score)=-0.66+-1.96) were included in the study. The children were randomly allocated to groups. The CombG and SG performed core stabilization exercises (CS) 3 days per week for 8 weeks. The CombG also performed aerobic exercises 3 days per week in addition to CS. Physical activity (PA) recommendations were provided to the CG. Exercise capacity was evaluated using the Modified Shuttle Test (MST). Oxidative stress was assessed using total antioxidant status (TAS), total oxidant status (TOS), Oxidative Stress Index (OSI), malondialdehyde (MDA), and superoxide dismutase (SOD). The irisin level was also measured. RESULTS: Children's baseline sex, age, BMI, and FEV1 z-scores were similar (p > 0.05). The MST distance (p = 0.047,np2=0.157) and%MST distance (p = 0.045, np2=0.159) significantly improved in the CombG compared with the SG and CG. Although TAS and SOD decreased over time (p < 0.05), no significant changes were observed for TAS, TOS, OSI, MDA, SOD, and irisin parameters between the groups after training (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Combining aerobic exercise training with core stabilization applied using telehealth improved exercise capacity more than core stabilitation training only or PA recommendations in children with CF.",

However, it still poses the challenges of accumulation in target sites and reducing off-target effects. Aerosol gene delivery for the treatment of pulmonary diseases has the advantages of high lung accumulation, specific targeting and fewer systemic side effects. However, the key challenge is selecting the appropriate formulation for aerosol gene delivery that can overcome physiological barriers. There are numerous existing gene carriers under study, including viral vectors and non-viral vectors. With the development of biomaterials, more biocompatible substances have applied gene delivery via inhalation. Furthermore, many types of genes can be delivered through aerosol inhalation, such as DNA, mRNA, siRNA and CRISPR/Cas9. Aerosol delivery of different types of genes has proven to be efficient in the treatment of many diseases such as SARS-CoV-2, cystic fibrosis and lung cancer. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the ongoing research on aerosol gene delivery therapy, including the basic respiratory system, different types of gene carriers, different types of carried genes and clinical applications.",

The elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor (ETI) combination has changed respiratory management. OBJECTIVE: To investigate how the perceived treatment burden changed in 1 year of treatment with ETI. DESIGN: Prospective observational study. METHODS: Ad hoc questionnaires for the pwCF and for the caregivers of pwCF < 18 years were administered before the initiation of ETI therapy and then at 6-12 months.

The International Physical Activity Questionnaire was used to determine levels of physical activity. Mixed-effect models were fitted to explore whether the time engaged in respiratory physiotherapy changed during 1 year. RESULTS: The study included 47/184 pwCF aged 21.4 (5.7) years, who completed 1 year of ETI therapy. At 6 months, time on aerosol therapy was decreased by 2.5 (95% CI -32.9 to 27.8) min/day, time on airway clearance therapies (ACTs) was decreased by 8.8 (95% CI -25.9 to 8.3) min/day, and time for cleaning and disinfecting respiratory equipment was decreased by 10.6 (95% CI -26.5 to 5.3) min/day.

From a transplant point of view, a multiorgan donor is considered of greatest efficiency, so that all organs that can potentially be used should be transplanted. The combination of the vast geographical territory of Russia, the shortage of actual donors, and the relatively small number of transplant centers has led to the need to transport donor lungs by air over long distances. There were already precedents in the world for remote preservation of donor organs for transplant. In this study, we have described the unique experience of remote evaluation of donor lungs with their subsequent air transportation and transplantation, which is the first such description in Russia to our knowledge. The donor lungs for lung transplant were brought from medical institutions of the Samara region to Moscow. During remote evaluation, all information was transmitted to the transplant center by providing access to the automated information system \"Organ Donation,\" which was used at that time by the service and contained all information about a potential donor in real time. The 2 transplant candidates had end-stage cystic fibrosis and severe respiratory failure; both patients underwent organ implantation from donors located outside their regions. In conditions of shortages of donor organs, long-distance transportation is a reasonable, feasible, and safe procedure.",

                    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease caused by variants in the gene encoding for the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, a chloride and bicarbonate channel. CFTR dysfunction results in a multiorgan disease with the main clinical features being exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and diffuse bronchiectasis with chronic airway infection leading to respiratory failure and premature death. Over the past decades, major progress has been made by implementing multidisciplinary care, including nutritional support, airway clearance techniques and antibiotics in specialised CF centres. The past decade has further seen the progressive development of oral medications, called CFTR modulators, for which around 80% of people with CF are genetically eligible in Europe. CFTR modulators partially restore ion transport and lead to a rapid and major improvement in clinical manifestations and lung function, presumably resulting in longer survival. CFTR modulators have been game-changing in the care of people with CF. However, many questions remain unanswered, such as the long-term effects of CFTR modulators, especially when treatment is started very early in life, or the new CF-related disease emerging due to CFTR modulators. Moreover, severe complications of CF, such as diabetes or cirrhosis, are not reversed on CFTR modulators and around 20% of people with CF bear CFTR variants leading to a CFTR protein that is unresponsive to CFTR modulators. Challenges also arise in adapting CF care to a changing disease. In this review article, we highlight the new questions and challenges emerging from this revolution in CF care.",

METHODS: Prospective cross-sectional study with cystic fibrosis adult patients under follow-up in a specialist consultation. Group 1 were patients who transitioned and Group 2 were transferred patients. The following information was collected: sociodemographic variables, degree of knowledge, skills, and emotional state using a survey designed for this purpose (as part of the internal consistency validation process). Participants also completed the emotional subscale of Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised. Inter-group comparisons were made for the transition/transfer, at the follow-up, and during the evolution. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients were analyzed; 65.8% male; mean age 31.9 years (SD =10.1). At the transition, Group 1 (n=19; 54.3%) had greater knowledge about their medication and reduced ability to manage appointments and making decisions in comparison to Group 2 at transfer. At follow-up, Group 1 made a better report on their emotional state and significantly improved their ability to manage appointments, communication, and decision-making. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who were moved to an adult cystic fibrosis unit through transition were more knowledgeable about their medications. However, those who were transferred managed their appointments and decision-making better, but felt sadder.",

Combined kidney-lung transplantation (CKLT) and kidney after lung transplantation (KALT) are the 2 preferred solutions to manage this situation. To evaluate these strategies, we describe kidney and lung graft outcomes and patient survival in patients managed with CKLT and KALT. MATERIAL AND METHODS We conducted a retrospective single-center cohort study. Patients who underwent a CKLT or a KALT were included in this study. Retrospective extraction of data from medical records was performed. RESULTS Seventeen patients underwent CKLT and 9 underwent KALT. Most of the patients had cystic fibrosis and presented renal failure related to anti-calcineurin toxicity. The 30-day and 1-year survival of CKLT recipients were both 75.6%. No patients with KALT died during the follow-up. Kidney graft prognosis was almost exclusively influenced by patient survival in relation to postoperative lung transplant complications. The rate of severe surgical complications was close to 60% for CKLT compared with 30% for KALT. The kidney graft function (estimated kidney graft function) did not differ according to the transplantation strategy. CONCLUSIONS KALT is a safe option, with postoperative morbidity and renal graft function identical to those of kidney transplantation in non-lung-transplanted patients. The results of CKLT depend mainly on the morbidity associated with lung transplantation but remain an attractive option for patients with respiratory failure associated with end-stage renal disease. The choice of transplant strategy must also take into account the most ethical and efficient allocation of kidney grafts.",

                    "abstract": "The major cause of mortality in people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) is progressive lung disease characterised by acute and chronic infections, the accumulation of mucus, airway inflammation, structural damage and pulmonary exacerbations. The prevalence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa rises rapidly in the teenage years, and this organism is the most common cause of chronic lung infection in adults with cystic fibrosis (CF). It is associated with an accelerated decline in lung function and premature death. New P. aeruginosa infections are treated with antibiotics to eradicate the organism, while chronic infections require long-term inhaled antibiotic therapy. The prevalence of P. aeruginosa infections has decreased in CF registries since the introduction of CF transmembrane conductance regulator modulators (CFTRm), but clinical observations suggest that chronic P. aeruginosa infections usually persist in patients receiving CFTRm. This indicates that pwCF may still need inhaled antibiotics in the CFTRm era to maintain long-term control of P. aeruginosa infections. Here, we provide an overview of the changing perceptions of P. aeruginosa infection management, including considerations on detection and treatment, the therapy burden associated with inhaled antibiotics and the potential effects of CFTRm on the lung microbiome. We conclude that updated guidance is required on the diagnosis and management of P. aeruginosa infection. In particular, we highlight a need for prospective studies to evaluate the consequences of stopping inhaled antibiotic therapy in pwCF who have chronic P. aeruginosa infection and are receiving CFTRm. This will help inform new guidelines on the use of antibiotics alongside CFTRm.",

                    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease caused by variants in the gene encoding for the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, a chloride and bicarbonate channel. CFTR dysfunction results in a multiorgan disease with the main clinical features being exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and diffuse bronchiectasis with chronic airway infection leading to respiratory failure and premature death. Over the past decades, major progress has been made by implementing multidisciplinary care, including nutritional support, airway clearance techniques and antibiotics in specialised CF centres. The past decade has further seen the progressive development of oral medications, called CFTR modulators, for which around 80% of people with CF are genetically eligible in Europe. CFTR modulators partially restore ion transport and lead to a rapid and major improvement in clinical manifestations and lung function, presumably resulting in longer survival. CFTR modulators have been game-changing in the care of people with CF. However, many questions remain unanswered, such as the long-term effects of CFTR modulators, especially when treatment is started very early in life, or the new CF-related disease emerging due to CFTR modulators. Moreover, severe complications of CF, such as diabetes or cirrhosis, are not reversed on CFTR modulators and around 20% of people with CF bear CFTR variants leading to a CFTR protein that is unresponsive to CFTR modulators. Challenges also arise in adapting CF care to a changing disease. In this review article, we highlight the new questions and challenges emerging from this revolution in CF care.",

Still, it remains largely unknown how solid organ transplant and different immunosuppressive medications affect development of vaccine-induced immunity. METHODS: In this work, we monitored humoral and cellular memory responses after mRNA SARS-CoV-2 two-doses and booster doses vaccination in cystic fibrosis lung transplanted patients (CFT) and compared them with both cystic fibrosis patients without lung transplant (CF) and with kidney transplant recipients (KT). In particular, we investigated the effects of immunosuppressive regimens on immune memory to SARS-CoV-2 after mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in transplanted patients. RESULTS: Our results showed that immunocompromised transplanted patients displayed a weak cellular and humoral memory to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination. In addition, obtained data clearly demonstrate that immunosuppressive therapy regimen including antimetabolites, further reduces patients' ability to respond to vaccination at both humoral and cell-mediated level. Notably, patient treated with antimetabolites showed a lower humoral and cellular response also after a booster dose vaccination. CONCLUSION: These results, even if obtained on a small patient's cohort, question whether immunocompromised patients need interventions to improve vaccine SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine response such as additional jab or modulation of immunosuppressive therapy.",

METHOD: A 12-year-old female (F12) and a 17-year-old male (M17), both diagnosed with cystic fibrosis and chronic P. aeruginosa lung infection, underwent bacteriophage treatment (BT). The administration involved bronchoscopic instillation and subsequent nebulisation.

Microbiological, clinical, and lung function assessments were conducted to assess this treatment modality. RESULTS: No adverse events (fever, localised reaction, wheeze or bronchospasm) occurred during BT. F12 demonstrated a 4% increase, while M17 showed a 5% improvement in FEV1% from their best FEV1% over the past three years following BT. A 12% (F12) and an 8% (M17) improvement from baseline FEV1% was observed. For F12 P. aeruginosa was not isolated from her sputum despite 12 previous hospitalisations for intravenous antibiotics.

A 12% (F12) and an 8% (M17) improvement from baseline FEV1% was observed. For F12 P. aeruginosa was not isolated from her sputum despite 12 previous hospitalisations for intravenous antibiotics. CONCLUSION: Bronchoscopic and nebulised routes of bacteriophage administration were well-tolerated in these two adolescents. This early report underscores the potential of this treatment modality and encourages clinicians and researchers to actively explore this innovative approach.",

This study aims to assess adherence to chest physiotherapy in adults with cystic fibrosis who not treated with tritherapy and to analyze the impact of certain factors on adherence. METHODS: Thus is a cross-sectional study, conducted using a questionnaire and a physiotherapy evaluation. Adherence to this treatment was measured in terms of quantitative and qualitative aspects. The impact on adherence of 15 factors was then assessed. RESULTS: Only 47% of patients could be considered as adherent, with a significant disparity between a quantitative and qualitative assessment. Gender, working time, pathology severity, the fact of being regularly followed by a physiotherapist, the perceived benefit of the sessions and their replacement by physical activity, seem associated with adherence to this treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Taking into account the qualitative aspect of the sessions, our study reveals a low rate, in our cohort, of adherence to respiratory physiotherapy, and highlights six factors likely to predominate. Regular follow-up by a physiotherapist seems to be a determining factor in adherence to this treatment.",

The elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor (ETI) combination has changed respiratory management. OBJECTIVE: To investigate how the perceived treatment burden changed in 1 year of treatment with ETI. DESIGN: Prospective observational study. METHODS: Ad hoc questionnaires for the pwCF and for the caregivers of pwCF < 18 years were administered before the initiation of ETI therapy and then at 6-12 months. The Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) and the Sinonasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) were administered to explore disease-related symptoms and social limitations. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire was used to determine levels of physical activity. Mixed-effect models were fitted to explore whether the time engaged in respiratory physiotherapy changed during 1 year. RESULTS: The study included 47/184 pwCF aged 21.4 (5.7) years, who completed 1 year of ETI therapy. At 6 months, time on aerosol therapy was decreased by 2.5 (95% CI -32.9 to 27.8) min/day, time on airway clearance therapies (ACTs) was decreased by 8.8 (95% CI -25.9 to 8.3) min/day, and time for cleaning and disinfecting respiratory equipment was decreased by 10.6 (95% CI -26.5 to 5.3) min/day. At 1 year, gains in time saved were nearly 15 min/day on average. At 1 year, 5/47 (10.6%) pwCF reported that they had discontinued positive expiratory pressure mask. CONCLUSION: PwCF on ETI may note less time engaged in their daily respiratory physiotherapy routine. Nonetheless, aerosol therapy, ACTs and maintaining respiratory equipment were still perceived as time-consuming daily activities.",

                    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a fatal autosomal recessive disorder caused by the loss of function mutations within a single gene for the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR). CFTR is a chloride channel that regulates ion and fluid transport across various epithelia. The discovery of CFTR as the CF gene and its cloning in 1989, coupled with extensive research that went into the understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms of CF, have led to the development of revolutionary therapies in CF that we see today. The highly effective modulator therapies have increased the survival rates of CF patients and shifted the epidemiological landscape and disease prognosis. However, the differential effect of modulators among CF patients and the presence of non-responders and ineligible patients underscore the need to develop specialized and customized therapies for a significant number of patients. Recent advances in the understanding of the CFTR structure, its expression, and defined cellular compositions will aid in developing more precise therapies. As the lifespan of CF patients continues to increase, it is becoming critical to clinically address the extra-pulmonary manifestations of CF disease to improve the quality of life of the patients. In-depth analysis of the molecular signature of different CF organs at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels is rapidly advancing and will help address the etiological causes and variability of CF among patients and develop precision medicine in CF. In this review, we will provide an overview of CF disease, leading to the discovery and characterization of CFTR and the development of CFTR modulators. The later sections of the review will delve into the key findings derived from single-molecule and single-cell-level analyses of CFTR, followed by an exploration of disease-relevant protein complexes of CFTR that may ultimately define the etiological course of CF disease.",

This review delves into the promises and challenges of non-viral gene delivery for CF therapy and explores strategies to overcome these hurdles. Several emerging technologies and nucleic acid cargos for CF gene therapy are discussed. Novel formulation approaches including lipid and polymeric nanoparticles promise enhanced delivery through the CF mucus barrier, augmenting the potential of non-viral strategies. Additionally, safety considerations and regulatory perspectives play a crucial role in navigating the path toward clinical translation of gene therapy.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Cystic Fibrosis (CF) liver disease progresses to liver failure requiring transplantation in about 3 % of patients, 0.7 % of CF patients are post liver transplant. The prognosis of CF has improved with the introduction of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI). Due to the paucity of data and concerns regarding interactions with immunosuppressive drug regimens, there is no general consensus on use of ETI post liver transplantation. The aim of this review is to report the safety and efficacy of ETI in CF patients who underwent liver transplantation. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted through MEDLINE/Pubmed and EMBASE databases. English-written articles reporting clinical data on liver transplanted CF patients treated with ETI were included. Article quality was evaluated using the Critical Appraisal Checklist for Case Reports. RESULTS: Twenty cases were retrieved from 6 reports. Temporary discontinuation and/or dose reduction due to elevated transaminases was required in 5 cases. ETI restarted on a reduced dose was tolerated in 3 out of 5 patients, 1 patient tolerated full dose. Tacrolimus dose change was required in 14 cases, in 1 case ETI was discontinued due to tacrolimus toxicity. Improvement in percentage predicted FEV1 was noted in 15/19 patients (median +17 %, range 8 %-38 %). CONCLUSIONS: In the majority of liver transplanted patients ETI is well tolerated, although adverse events and liver function abnormalities may occur. Close monitoring of liver function and tacrolimus level is warranted. Significant improvement in lung function after ETI initiation is confirmed, highlighting the importance of accessing this medication for this group of patients.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To characterise the investigations, management and ultimate diagnosis of neonates with distal intestinal obstruction. METHODS: Retrospective review of term (> 37 weeks) neonates with admission diagnosis of distal intestinal obstruction over 10 years (2012-2022). Patient pathways were identified and associations between presentations, response to treatments and outcome investigated. RESULTS: A total of 124 neonates were identified and all included. Initial management was colonic irrigation in 108, contrast enema in 4, and laparotomy in 12. Of those responding to irrigations none underwent contrast enema. Ultimately, 22 neonates proceeded to laparotomy. Overall, 106 had a suction rectal biopsy and 41 had genetic testing for cystic fibrosis. Final diagnosis was Hirschsprung disease (HD) in 67, meconium ileus with cystic fibrosis (CF) in 9, meconium plug syndrome in 19 (including 3 with CF), intestinal atresia in 10 and no formal diagnosis in 17. Median length of neonatal unit stay was 11 days (7-19). CONCLUSIONS: Initial management of neonates with distal bowel obstruction should be colonic irrigation since this is therapeutic in the majority and significantly reduces the need for contrast enema. These infants should all have suction rectal biopsy to investigate for HD unless another diagnosis is evident. If a meconium plug is passed, testing for CF is recommended. Evaluation and therapy are multimodal and time consuming, placing burden on resources and families.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND End-stage renal disease is a major issue in the management of patients undergoing lung transplantation. Combined kidney-lung transplantation (CKLT) and kidney after lung transplantation (KALT) are the 2 preferred solutions to manage this situation. To evaluate these strategies, we describe kidney and lung graft outcomes and patient survival in patients managed with CKLT and KALT. MATERIAL AND METHODS We conducted a retrospective single-center cohort study. Patients who underwent a CKLT or a KALT were included in this study. Retrospective extraction of data from medical records was performed. RESULTS Seventeen patients underwent CKLT and 9 underwent KALT. Most of the patients had cystic fibrosis and presented renal failure related to anti-calcineurin toxicity. The 30-day and 1-year survival of CKLT recipients were both 75.6%. No patients with KALT died during the follow-up. Kidney graft prognosis was almost exclusively influenced by patient survival in relation to postoperative lung transplant complications. The rate of severe surgical complications was close to 60% for CKLT compared with 30% for KALT. The kidney graft function (estimated kidney graft function) did not differ according to the transplantation strategy. CONCLUSIONS KALT is a safe option, with postoperative morbidity and renal graft function identical to those of kidney transplantation in non-lung-transplanted patients. The results of CKLT depend mainly on the morbidity associated with lung transplantation but remain an attractive option for patients with respiratory failure associated with end-stage renal disease. The choice of transplant strategy must also take into account the most ethical and efficient allocation of kidney grafts.",

The patient qualified for double organ liver-pancreas transplantation beyond typical indications. The respiratory symptoms of cystic fibrosis were moderate and well-treated. The patient was endangered mainly by liver insufficiency and recurrent hypoglycemia, which was due to the treatment of diabetes with high doses of insulin. Computed tomography showed mild bronchiectasis, cirrhotic liver, splenomegaly, and atrophy of the pancreas. Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonized the upper respiratory tract. Gastrointestinal complications were sufficient for the patient to be qualified for combined liver-pancreas transplantation. METHODS: First, a standard hepatectomy was performed. The liver was transplanted orthotopically. Subsequently, the team performed pancreas transplantation through a separate incision. The donor's duodenum was anastomosed to the recipient's jejunum, close to the ligament of Treitz. RESULTS: No serious complications were noted during the postoperative period. Transplanted organs started functioning without delay. The patient was discharged after 6 weeks in general good condition.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A 21-year-old woman diagnosed with cystic fibrosis developed cirrhosis, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. The patient qualified for double organ liver-pancreas transplantation beyond typical indications. The respiratory symptoms of cystic fibrosis were moderate and well-treated. The patient was endangered mainly by liver insufficiency and recurrent hypoglycemia, which was due to the treatment of diabetes with high doses of insulin. Computed tomography showed mild bronchiectasis, cirrhotic liver, splenomegaly, and atrophy of the pancreas. Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonized the upper respiratory tract. Gastrointestinal complications were sufficient for the patient to be qualified for combined liver-pancreas transplantation. METHODS: First, a standard hepatectomy was performed. The liver was transplanted orthotopically. Subsequently, the team performed pancreas transplantation through a separate incision. The donor's duodenum was anastomosed to the recipient's jejunum, close to the ligament of Treitz. RESULTS: No serious complications were noted during the postoperative period. Transplanted organs started functioning without delay. The patient was discharged after 6 weeks in general good condition. Twenty months later, the patient felt well, and the grafts kept functioning properly. CONCLUSION: Combined liver-pancreas transplantation in patients with CF restores exocrine and endocrine pancreatic function and minimizes the risk of life-threatening complications associated with liver insufficiency. Improvement of life quality coincides with the possibility of discontinuing insulin and pancreatic enzyme supplementation. The combination of liver and pancreas transplantation may prevent advanced pulmonary complications, extend the prognosis of survival, and improve the long-term life quality.",

These novel therapeutic approaches have permitted unprecedented opportunities for quality-of-life improvement and for enhancing people with CF's (pwCF) life expectancy. AREAS COVERED: The aim of this review is to describe the current knowledge gaps. A comprehensive search strategy was undertaken to assess impact of HEMT in life of pwCF, treatment challenges in specific populations such as very young children, and research needs. EXPERT OPINION: HEMTs are prescribed for pwCF with definite genotypes. The heterogeneity of variants complicates treatment possibilities and around 10% of pwCF worldwide remains ineligible. Genotype-specific treatments are prompting theratyping and personalized medicine strategies. Improvement in lung function and quality of life increase survival rates, shifting CF from a pediatric to an adult disease. This implies new studies addressing long-term efficacy, side effects, emergence of adult co-morbidities and possible drug-drug interactions. More sensitive and predictive biomarkers for both efficacy and toxicity are warranted. As HEMTs cross the placenta and are found in breast milk, studies addressing the potential consequences of treatment during pregnancy and breastfeeding are urgently needed. Finally, although the treatment and expected outcomes of CF have improved dramatically in high- and middle-income countries, lack of access in low-income countries to these lifesaving and life-changing medicines highlights inequity of care worldwide.",

This study sought to understand the impact on the health of children whose modulator treatments were interrupted because of legal procedures and delivery processes. Our study identified that the significant increase in percent-predicted forced expiratory volume levels (FEV1) and BMI z-score values associated with modulator therapies decreased sharply with their discontinuation. Significant worsening in FEV1, BMI z-scores, and BW z-scores were detected in the first follow-up visit after therapy discontinuation within 1 month. Eight patients had a reduction of FEV1 of more than 10%. The findings suggest that modulatory treatment continuation is important, and it is crucial that treatment is not interrupted.",

CFRD has been correlated with important clinical outcomes, including poor nutrition, reduced pulmonary function, and earlier mortality. However, clinical decline due to abnormalities of blood glucose (dysglycemia) begins early in CF, before the diagnosis of CFRD by the gold-standard oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) has been validated in patients with CF and has been recognized as a valuable tool in detecting early glucose abnormalities in patients with CF. Several CGM parameters have been used to predict CFRD in some but not all studies, and there is no consensus regarding CGM use for diagnostic purposes. Thus, it remains a complementary test to OGTT in CFRD diagnosis. The aim of this review is to provide an update on the pathophysiological mechanisms of CFRD, recent advances in the use of CGM for CFRD screening, and the association between CGM measures and CF-related clinical outcomes.",

AIM: To examine the use of DPP4-I therapy in patients with CFRD at a single large adult cystic fibrosis center. METHOD: People with CFRD prescribed a DPP4-I were identified from our specialist CFRD clinic and records were retrospectively examined for indication for therapy, tolerability and effectiveness. Analysis of continuous glucose monitoring data Libre 2 was done for these patients (CGM) pre and at least 3 months post therapy was performed. RESULTS: 23 people with CF (PwCF) with a mean (SD) age of 35.0 +- 2.4 years were included in this analysis . In 21 patients DPP4-I was prescribed as a monotherapy and it was given in combination with insulin in 2 others. Indications for therapy included reactive hypoglycaemia (n = 10) post prandial hyperglycaemia (8), insulin avoidance (3), metformin intolerance (1) and unclear (1). Therapy was well tolerated with no discontinuations due to adverse effects. Significant improvements were noted in Time in Range- Pre vs Post: 78.0 [67.5 - 84.0] vs 89.0 [79.8 - 96.0]%, p = 0.005, Time above Range -Pre vs Post: 19.5 [12.5 - 30.8] vs 6.0 [2.5 - 16.5]%, p = 0.006 and glucose variability Pre versus Post: 28.3 [25.4 - 31.1] vs 26.9 [23.1 - 31.3], p = 0.021, Of the 10 subjects who initiated therapy for hypoglycaemia, 7 reported an improvement in symptoms. No significant difference was found in weight pre and post: 61.5 +- 15.0 kg vs 62.5 +- 15.3 kg, p = 0.326 or Hba1c pre vs post: 41.0 [36.0 - 53.3] mmol/mol versus 40.5 [36.8 - 47.3], p = 0.727.

The role of new technologies for the treatment of CFRD is little explored. The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of Advanced Hybrid Closed Loop (AHCL) systems on glycemic control in CF patients. Methods: A single-center retrospective study on CFRD patients using AHCL systems was performed. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) values and Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) metrics were collected at T0 (AHCL placement), T1 (1-month), T2 (6-months) and T3 (1-year) to evaluate glycemic control. Results: 10 patients were included in the study. Data showed a reduction of HbA1c value (7.31 +- 0.34 to 6.35 +- 1.00; p=0.03), glycemic variability (p=0.05) and insulin requirement (p=0.03). The study population reached American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommended glycemic targets at 1-year. An increase in the Time in Range (TIR) and a reduction in time in hyperglycemia were also observed, although not statistically significant. Conclusions: In patients with CFRD, the use of AHCL leads to an improvement in glycemic control in terms of HbA1c and glycemic variability. The increase in TIR and the reduction of time in hyperglycemia, although not statistically significant, are extremely encouraging from a clinical point of view. Further studies with a larger population and a longer follow-up are needed. The results of this study demonstrate the importance of proposing the use of AHCL even in CF patients, who could benefit from glycemic improvement also in terms of nutritional status and respiratory function.",

Ultimately, 22 neonates proceeded to laparotomy. Overall, 106 had a suction rectal biopsy and 41 had genetic testing for cystic fibrosis. Final diagnosis was Hirschsprung disease (HD) in 67, meconium ileus with cystic fibrosis (CF) in 9, meconium plug syndrome in 19 (including 3 with CF), intestinal atresia in 10 and no formal diagnosis in 17. Median length of neonatal unit stay was 11 days (7-19). CONCLUSIONS: Initial management of neonates with distal bowel obstruction should be colonic irrigation since this is therapeutic in the majority and significantly reduces the need for contrast enema. These infants should all have suction rectal biopsy to investigate for HD unless another diagnosis is evident. If a meconium plug is passed, testing for CF is recommended. Evaluation and therapy are multimodal and time consuming, placing burden on resources and families.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) experience increased oxidative stress. Tele-exercise can be a new method to improve exercise in CF. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the effect of telehealth-based exercise training using different modalities (combined exercise training group, CombG, core stabilization exercise group, SG), in comparison with control group (CG), on exercise capacity, oxidative stress, and irisin in children with CF. METHODS: Thirty-nine children with CF (mean age=11.41+-2.18 years, mean FEV1(z-score)=-0.66+-1.96) were included in the study. The children were randomly allocated to groups. The CombG and SG performed core stabilization exercises (CS) 3 days per week for 8 weeks. The CombG also performed aerobic exercises 3 days per week in addition to CS. Physical activity (PA) recommendations were provided to the CG. Exercise capacity was evaluated using the Modified Shuttle Test (MST). Oxidative stress was assessed using total antioxidant status (TAS), total oxidant status (TOS), Oxidative Stress Index (OSI), malondialdehyde (MDA), and superoxide dismutase (SOD). The irisin level was also measured. RESULTS: Children's baseline sex, age, BMI, and FEV1 z-scores were similar (p > 0.05). The MST distance (p = 0.047,np2=0.157) and%MST distance (p = 0.045, np2=0.159) significantly improved in the CombG compared with the SG and CG. Although TAS and SOD decreased over time (p < 0.05), no significant changes were observed for TAS, TOS, OSI, MDA, SOD, and irisin parameters between the groups after training (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Combining aerobic exercise training with core stabilization applied using telehealth improved exercise capacity more than core stabilitation training only or PA recommendations in children with CF.",

                    "abstract": "The major cause of mortality in people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) is progressive lung disease characterised by acute and chronic infections, the accumulation of mucus, airway inflammation, structural damage and pulmonary exacerbations. The prevalence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa rises rapidly in the teenage years, and this organism is the most common cause of chronic lung infection in adults with cystic fibrosis (CF). It is associated with an accelerated decline in lung function and premature death. New P. aeruginosa infections are treated with antibiotics to eradicate the organism, while chronic infections require long-term inhaled antibiotic therapy. The prevalence of P. aeruginosa infections has decreased in CF registries since the introduction of CF transmembrane conductance regulator modulators (CFTRm), but clinical observations suggest that chronic P. aeruginosa infections usually persist in patients receiving CFTRm. This indicates that pwCF may still need inhaled antibiotics in the CFTRm era to maintain long-term control of P. aeruginosa infections. Here, we provide an overview of the changing perceptions of P. aeruginosa infection management, including considerations on detection and treatment, the therapy burden associated with inhaled antibiotics and the potential effects of CFTRm on the lung microbiome. We conclude that updated guidance is required on the diagnosis and management of P. aeruginosa infection. In particular, we highlight a need for prospective studies to evaluate the consequences of stopping inhaled antibiotic therapy in pwCF who have chronic P. aeruginosa infection and are receiving CFTRm. This will help inform new guidelines on the use of antibiotics alongside CFTRm.",

                    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: 'Highly effective' modulator therapies (HEMTs) have radically changed the Cystic Fibrosis (CF) therapeutic landscape. These novel therapeutic approaches have permitted unprecedented opportunities for quality-of-life improvement and for enhancing people with CF's (pwCF) life expectancy. AREAS COVERED: The aim of this review is to describe the current knowledge gaps. A comprehensive search strategy was undertaken to assess impact of HEMT in life of pwCF, treatment challenges in specific populations such as very young children, and research needs. EXPERT OPINION: HEMTs are prescribed for pwCF with definite genotypes. The heterogeneity of variants complicates treatment possibilities and around 10% of pwCF worldwide remains ineligible. Genotype-specific treatments are prompting theratyping and personalized medicine strategies. Improvement in lung function and quality of life increase survival rates, shifting CF from a pediatric to an adult disease. This implies new studies addressing long-term efficacy, side effects, emergence of adult co-morbidities and possible drug-drug interactions. More sensitive and predictive biomarkers for both efficacy and toxicity are warranted. As HEMTs cross the placenta and are found in breast milk, studies addressing the potential consequences of treatment during pregnancy and breastfeeding are urgently needed. Finally, although the treatment and expected outcomes of CF have improved dramatically in high- and middle-income countries, lack of access in low-income countries to these lifesaving and life-changing medicines highlights inequity of care worldwide.",

Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an ion channel that facilitates transportation of water and salts across epithelial cell membranes through the conductance of Cl- and other anions. A dysfunctional CFTR due to abnormalities in the cftr gene causes CF, which is believed to be a rare disease in India mainly due to mis/underdiagnosis. Although numerous diagnostic methods and treatment options are available for CF globally, most of these are unaffordable for developing countries like India. Currently, CF symptoms are managed with mucolytics, antibiotics, anti-inflammatory drugs, and various CFTR modulators based on the type of defect. While a definitive cure for CF remains elusive, advancements in stem cell and gene therapies hold promise for permanent cure in the near future. In this review, we discuss the prevalence of CF cases in India, affordable diagnostic methods, and treatment options amenable for developing countries.

It is critical for CF clinicians to begin to discuss health considerations related to an aging and overall healthier CF population. Such considerations include family planning, reproductive health, and contraception. CF care teams are trusted sources of medical information and therefore often have initial discussions related to contraception for PwCF. The purpose of this article is to review the available pharmacologic contraceptive methods, with a specific focus on the benefits and risks that may be more relevant to PwCF.",

This triple drug is currently not indicated in liver transplant patients, as clinical trials including subjects with previous solid organ transplantation are lacking. CASE PRESENTATION: We report on a liver transplant girl with CF-related advanced pulmonary disease meeting clinical criteria for lung transplant, who started the triple modulator because she could not get on the lung transplant waiting list due to psycho-social motivations. Since initiation of ETI therapy, she has experienced a significant improvement in respiratory function and quality of life, without adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: This case shows that ETI therapy can represent a lifesaving drug for individuals without alternatives, even in liver transplant patients. The clinical benefits of the modulator overcome risks, which may be limited with a close drug monitoring of immunosuppressants serum levels and functional liver tests.",

To assess whether dual systemic antibiotics against P. aeruginosa in outpatients with COPD, non-cystic fibrosis (non-CF) bronchiectasis, or asthma can improve outcomes. METHODS: Multicenter, randomised, open-label trial conducted at seven respiratory outpatient clinics in Denmark. Outpatients with COPD, non-CF bronchiectasis, or asthma with a current P. aeruginosa-positive lower respiratory tract culture (clinical routine samples obtained based on symptoms of exacerbation not requiring hospitalisation), regardless of prior P. aeruginosa-status, no current need for hospitalisation, and at least two moderate or one hospitalisation-requiring exacerbation within the last year were eligible. Patients were assigned 1:1 to 14 days of dual systemic anti-pseudomonal antibiotics or no antibiotic treatment. Primary outcome was time to prednisolone or antibiotic-requiring exacerbation or death from day 20 to day 365. RESULTS: The trial was stopped prematurely based in lack of recruitment during the COVID-19 pandemic, this decision was endorsed by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board. Forty-nine outpatients were included in the study. There was a reduction in risk of the primary outcome in the antibiotic group compared to the control group (HR 0.51 (95%CI 0.27-0.96), p = 0.037).

The extent of remaining healthy pancreatic parenchyma determines the risk of developing future episodes of pancreatitis, as well as pancreatic exocrine or endocrine insufficiency. Pancreatitis may be the presenting symptom of CF, and genetic testing is especially important in pediatrics. AP and recurrent AP are managed with intravenous fluid hydration and pain control, in addition to early refeeding and treatment of complications. With the use of modulator therapy in CF, pancreatic function may be restored to some extent. CP related pain is managed with analgesics and neuromodulators, with surgery if indicated in specific situations including TPIAT as a possible type of surgical intervention. Long-term sequelae of CP in patients with CF include exocrine pancreatic insufficiency treated with pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies and associated metabolic complications such as bone disease/osteoporosis, pancreatogenic diabetes, and less commonly, pancreatic cancer.

METHODS: Prospective cross-sectional study with cystic fibrosis adult patients under follow-up in a specialist consultation. Group 1 were patients who transitioned and Group 2 were transferred patients. The following information was collected: sociodemographic variables, degree of knowledge, skills, and emotional state using a survey designed for this purpose (as part of the internal consistency validation process). Participants also completed the emotional subscale of Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised. Inter-group comparisons were made for the transition/transfer, at the follow-up, and during the evolution. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients were analyzed; 65.8% male; mean age 31.9 years (SD =10.1). At the transition, Group 1 (n=19; 54.3%) had greater knowledge about their medication and reduced ability to manage appointments and making decisions in comparison to Group 2 at transfer. At follow-up, Group 1 made a better report on their emotional state and significantly improved their ability to manage appointments, communication, and decision-making. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who were moved to an adult cystic fibrosis unit through transition were more knowledgeable about their medications. However, those who were transferred managed their appointments and decision-making better, but felt sadder.",

                    "abstract": "The major cause of mortality in people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) is progressive lung disease characterised by acute and chronic infections, the accumulation of mucus, airway inflammation, structural damage and pulmonary exacerbations. The prevalence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa rises rapidly in the teenage years, and this organism is the most common cause of chronic lung infection in adults with cystic fibrosis (CF). It is associated with an accelerated decline in lung function and premature death. New P. aeruginosa infections are treated with antibiotics to eradicate the organism, while chronic infections require long-term inhaled antibiotic therapy. The prevalence of P. aeruginosa infections has decreased in CF registries since the introduction of CF transmembrane conductance regulator modulators (CFTRm), but clinical observations suggest that chronic P. aeruginosa infections usually persist in patients receiving CFTRm. This indicates that pwCF may still need inhaled antibiotics in the CFTRm era to maintain long-term control of P. aeruginosa infections. Here, we provide an overview of the changing perceptions of P. aeruginosa infection management, including considerations on detection and treatment, the therapy burden associated with inhaled antibiotics and the potential effects of CFTRm on the lung microbiome. We conclude that updated guidance is required on the diagnosis and management of P. aeruginosa infection. In particular, we highlight a need for prospective studies to evaluate the consequences of stopping inhaled antibiotic therapy in pwCF who have chronic P. aeruginosa infection and are receiving CFTRm. This will help inform new guidelines on the use of antibiotics alongside CFTRm.",

The prognosis of CF has improved with the introduction of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI). Due to the paucity of data and concerns regarding interactions with immunosuppressive drug regimens, there is no general consensus on use of ETI post liver transplantation. The aim of this review is to report the safety and efficacy of ETI in CF patients who underwent liver transplantation. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted through MEDLINE/Pubmed and EMBASE databases. English-written articles reporting clinical data on liver transplanted CF patients treated with ETI were included. Article quality was evaluated using the Critical Appraisal Checklist for Case Reports. RESULTS: Twenty cases were retrieved from 6 reports. Temporary discontinuation and/or dose reduction due to elevated transaminases was required in 5 cases. ETI restarted on a reduced dose was tolerated in 3 out of 5 patients, 1 patient tolerated full dose. Tacrolimus dose change was required in 14 cases, in 1 case ETI was discontinued due to tacrolimus toxicity. Improvement in percentage predicted FEV1 was noted in 15/19 patients (median +17 %, range 8 %-38 %). CONCLUSIONS: In the majority of liver transplanted patients ETI is well tolerated, although adverse events and liver function abnormalities may occur. Close monitoring of liver function and tacrolimus level is warranted. Significant improvement in lung function after ETI initiation is confirmed, highlighting the importance of accessing this medication for this group of patients.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: To limit the progression of disease, people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) perform daily respiratory physiotherapy, which is perceived as the most burdensome routine in managing their condition. The elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor (ETI) combination has changed respiratory management. OBJECTIVE: To investigate how the perceived treatment burden changed in 1 year of treatment with ETI. DESIGN: Prospective observational study. METHODS: Ad hoc questionnaires for the pwCF and for the caregivers of pwCF < 18 years were administered before the initiation of ETI therapy and then at 6-12 months. The Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) and the Sinonasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) were administered to explore disease-related symptoms and social limitations. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire was used to determine levels of physical activity. Mixed-effect models were fitted to explore whether the time engaged in respiratory physiotherapy changed during 1 year. RESULTS: The study included 47/184 pwCF aged 21.4 (5.7) years, who completed 1 year of ETI therapy. At 6 months, time on aerosol therapy was decreased by 2.5 (95% CI -32.9 to 27.8) min/day, time on airway clearance therapies (ACTs) was decreased by 8.8 (95% CI -25.9 to 8.3) min/day, and time for cleaning and disinfecting respiratory equipment was decreased by 10.6 (95% CI -26.5 to 5.3) min/day. At 1 year, gains in time saved were nearly 15 min/day on average. At 1 year, 5/47 (10.6%) pwCF reported that they had discontinued positive expiratory pressure mask. CONCLUSION: PwCF on ETI may note less time engaged in their daily respiratory physiotherapy routine. Nonetheless, aerosol therapy, ACTs and maintaining respiratory equipment were still perceived as time-consuming daily activities.",

They had, at least, one F508del mutation. Data were collected before ETI initiation and 3, 6, and 12 months after. RESULTS: Glycemic control measured by HbA1c significantly improved by 0.3 % (0.1-0.5) after 3 months of ETI therapy (p = 0.004) and kept this improvement during follow-up (p < 0.001). The proportion of patients needing multiple daily injections of insulin was reduced by 16 % (p = 0.023). Total daily insulin dose dropped by 0.12 (0.05-0.18) UI/kg/day (p < 0.001). Data derived from Flash Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) for patients treated with insulin stayed unchanged after insulin reduction, except for a significant 8 % (0.3-15.6) increase in the Time In Tight Range (TITR) between 70 and 140 mg/dL (p = 0.043).

                    "abstract": "Gene therapy is gradually becoming a mainstream treatment modality and is no longer the preserve of large university departments whose laboratories master nucleic acid analytical procedures and whose clinical teams manage its administration. It was originally designed for genetic diseases that, because of their prevalence, were a group known as rare diseases. Gene therapy has so far been applied in children to act before the disease development. These new treatments have also begun to be applied for common diseases such as metabolic disorders (e. g. diabetes) and even for those that are increasingly affecting us, such as various malignancies and diseases of the central nervous system (e. g. Alzheimer's disease). The targets targeted by GT are genes, where pathogenic alterations in the form of pathogenic variants (formerly mutations) induce phenotypic disorders, and our aim is either to knock them out of function (e. g. haemoglobinopathies) or to replace them with genes with normal function, which we introduce into the genome using one of the appropriate vectors, such as viruses or liposomes. The process of GT can take place directly inside the patient's body (in vivo) or outside the body on isolated cells (ex vivo), which are usually stem cells (iPSCs, induced pluripotent stem cell). After treatment, these cells are returned to the patient's body to fulfil their \"destiny\". In a broader sense, GT can target the product of gene transcription, which is the messenger RNA, or the end product of gene function, such as functional proteins (eg. cystic fibrosis). Any of these approaches have been used successfully in various diseases, depending on their availability, which is determined, among other things, by the costs associated with GT or the accessibility of the target tissue. Ultimately, it is not only the validation of the efficacy and safety of GT, but also economic reasons that determine why GT has been slow to develop and is mostly undertaken only by large and wealthy institutions. Another decisive factor is that from initial experimental work through clinical trials, the whole process of its development normally takes up to a decade.",

Therapies targeting the CFTR protein, in particular CFTR modulators, have transformed the prognosis of patients, bringing the hope of a normal life with the possibility of starting a family and growing old, challenging established statistics. However, patients are not yet cured, and side effects remain insufficiently documented. Epidemiological changes create new challenges for the management of cystic fibrosis. Approximately 10 % of patients still lack a therapeutic option. The community of researchers, pharmaceutical industries, patient associations, and health authorities remains committed to monitor the long-term effects of these still poorly characterised treatments, and to explore new pharmacological approaches, such as gene therapies.",

This triple drug is currently not indicated in liver transplant patients, as clinical trials including subjects with previous solid organ transplantation are lacking. CASE PRESENTATION: We report on a liver transplant girl with CF-related advanced pulmonary disease meeting clinical criteria for lung transplant, who started the triple modulator because she could not get on the lung transplant waiting list due to psycho-social motivations. Since initiation of ETI therapy, she has experienced a significant improvement in respiratory function and quality of life, without adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: This case shows that ETI therapy can represent a lifesaving drug for individuals without alternatives, even in liver transplant patients. The clinical benefits of the modulator overcome risks, which may be limited with a close drug monitoring of immunosuppressants serum levels and functional liver tests.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To characterise the investigations, management and ultimate diagnosis of neonates with distal intestinal obstruction. METHODS: Retrospective review of term (> 37 weeks) neonates with admission diagnosis of distal intestinal obstruction over 10 years (2012-2022). Patient pathways were identified and associations between presentations, response to treatments and outcome investigated. RESULTS: A total of 124 neonates were identified and all included. Initial management was colonic irrigation in 108, contrast enema in 4, and laparotomy in 12. Of those responding to irrigations none underwent contrast enema. Ultimately, 22 neonates proceeded to laparotomy. Overall, 106 had a suction rectal biopsy and 41 had genetic testing for cystic fibrosis. Final diagnosis was Hirschsprung disease (HD) in 67, meconium ileus with cystic fibrosis (CF) in 9, meconium plug syndrome in 19 (including 3 with CF), intestinal atresia in 10 and no formal diagnosis in 17. Median length of neonatal unit stay was 11 days (7-19). CONCLUSIONS: Initial management of neonates with distal bowel obstruction should be colonic irrigation since this is therapeutic in the majority and significantly reduces the need for contrast enema. These infants should all have suction rectal biopsy to investigate for HD unless another diagnosis is evident. If a meconium plug is passed, testing for CF is recommended. Evaluation and therapy are multimodal and time consuming, placing burden on resources and families.",

The role of new technologies for the treatment of CFRD is little explored. The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of Advanced Hybrid Closed Loop (AHCL) systems on glycemic control in CF patients. Methods: A single-center retrospective study on CFRD patients using AHCL systems was performed. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) values and Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) metrics were collected at T0 (AHCL placement), T1 (1-month), T2 (6-months) and T3 (1-year) to evaluate glycemic control. Results: 10 patients were included in the study. Data showed a reduction of HbA1c value (7.31 +- 0.34 to 6.35 +- 1.00; p=0.03), glycemic variability (p=0.05) and insulin requirement (p=0.03). The study population reached American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommended glycemic targets at 1-year. An increase in the Time in Range (TIR) and a reduction in time in hyperglycemia were also observed, although not statistically significant. Conclusions: In patients with CFRD, the use of AHCL leads to an improvement in glycemic control in terms of HbA1c and glycemic variability. The increase in TIR and the reduction of time in hyperglycemia, although not statistically significant, are extremely encouraging from a clinical point of view. Further studies with a larger population and a longer follow-up are needed. The results of this study demonstrate the importance of proposing the use of AHCL even in CF patients, who could benefit from glycemic improvement also in terms of nutritional status and respiratory function.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Influenza A (H1N1) is a contagious respiratory infection caused by the influenza A virus. In the majority of cases, H1N1 influenza is benign. However, it can be dangerous for infants and children with underlying chronic diseases. The severity of influenza depends on various factors, including the virulence of the virus strain, preexisting immunity level, and individual health conditions. The aim of this study is to describe the clinical profile of H1N1 influenza in hospitalized infants and children. METHODS: This is a prospective and descriptive study conducted from November 1, 2018, to January 31, 2024. In this study, we included all children under 14 years old hospitalized for suspected severe lower respiratory infection who had gone through virological testing. We used a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) kit: the Film Array-Respiratory Panel. Due to the depletion of multiplex PCR kits, this study continued using rapid influenza diagnostic tests based on immunochromatographic technique. RESULTS: We report 45 confirmed cases of H1N1 influenza, collected during the period from November 1, 2018, to January 31, 2024. The average age was 2 years and 4 months. The main reason for admission was respiratory distress found in all patients. In 53% of the cases, there was an associated comorbidity, including asthma (17 cases), prematurity (2 cases), congenital adrenal hyperplasia (2 cases), cystic fibrosis (1 case), undetermined etiology bronchial dilation (1 case), and Basedow's disease (1 case). The clinical presentation included viral bronchiolitis (17 cases), moderate asthma exacerbation (10 cases), severe asthma exacerbation (7 cases), pneumonia (9 cases), bronchial dilation exacerbation (1 case), and flu-like syndrome with adrenal insufficiency (1 case). Fever was present in 31 patients. Gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting were present in 20 cases. Three patients required intensive care, with 2 children being intubated and ventilated (one severe acute asthma and one severe viral bronchiolitis). Two cases were treated with oseltamivir. The average length of hospital stay was 7.5 days, ranging from 3 to 20 days. All cases showed favorable evolution. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that preventive measures remain crucial, and influenza vaccination is highly recommended in cases of underlying morbidity.",

                    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: 'Highly effective' modulator therapies (HEMTs) have radically changed the Cystic Fibrosis (CF) therapeutic landscape. These novel therapeutic approaches have permitted unprecedented opportunities for quality-of-life improvement and for enhancing people with CF's (pwCF) life expectancy. AREAS COVERED: The aim of this review is to describe the current knowledge gaps. A comprehensive search strategy was undertaken to assess impact of HEMT in life of pwCF, treatment challenges in specific populations such as very young children, and research needs. EXPERT OPINION: HEMTs are prescribed for pwCF with definite genotypes. The heterogeneity of variants complicates treatment possibilities and around 10% of pwCF worldwide remains ineligible. Genotype-specific treatments are prompting theratyping and personalized medicine strategies. Improvement in lung function and quality of life increase survival rates, shifting CF from a pediatric to an adult disease. This implies new studies addressing long-term efficacy, side effects, emergence of adult co-morbidities and possible drug-drug interactions. More sensitive and predictive biomarkers for both efficacy and toxicity are warranted. As HEMTs cross the placenta and are found in breast milk, studies addressing the potential consequences of treatment during pregnancy and breastfeeding are urgently needed. Finally, although the treatment and expected outcomes of CF have improved dramatically in high- and middle-income countries, lack of access in low-income countries to these lifesaving and life-changing medicines highlights inequity of care worldwide.",

                    "abstract": "Gene therapy is gradually becoming a mainstream treatment modality and is no longer the preserve of large university departments whose laboratories master nucleic acid analytical procedures and whose clinical teams manage its administration. It was originally designed for genetic diseases that, because of their prevalence, were a group known as rare diseases. Gene therapy has so far been applied in children to act before the disease development. These new treatments have also begun to be applied for common diseases such as metabolic disorders (e. g. diabetes) and even for those that are increasingly affecting us, such as various malignancies and diseases of the central nervous system (e. g. Alzheimer's disease). The targets targeted by GT are genes, where pathogenic alterations in the form of pathogenic variants (formerly mutations) induce phenotypic disorders, and our aim is either to knock them out of function (e. g. haemoglobinopathies) or to replace them with genes with normal function, which we introduce into the genome using one of the appropriate vectors, such as viruses or liposomes. The process of GT can take place directly inside the patient's body (in vivo) or outside the body on isolated cells (ex vivo), which are usually stem cells (iPSCs, induced pluripotent stem cell). After treatment, these cells are returned to the patient's body to fulfil their \"destiny\". In a broader sense, GT can target the product of gene transcription, which is the messenger RNA, or the end product of gene function, such as functional proteins (eg. cystic fibrosis). Any of these approaches have been used successfully in various diseases, depending on their availability, which is determined, among other things, by the costs associated with GT or the accessibility of the target tissue. Ultimately, it is not only the validation of the efficacy and safety of GT, but also economic reasons that determine why GT has been slow to develop and is mostly undertaken only by large and wealthy institutions. Another decisive factor is that from initial experimental work through clinical trials, the whole process of its development normally takes up to a decade.",

                    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a fatal autosomal recessive disorder caused by the loss of function mutations within a single gene for the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR). CFTR is a chloride channel that regulates ion and fluid transport across various epithelia. The discovery of CFTR as the CF gene and its cloning in 1989, coupled with extensive research that went into the understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms of CF, have led to the development of revolutionary therapies in CF that we see today. The highly effective modulator therapies have increased the survival rates of CF patients and shifted the epidemiological landscape and disease prognosis. However, the differential effect of modulators among CF patients and the presence of non-responders and ineligible patients underscore the need to develop specialized and customized therapies for a significant number of patients. Recent advances in the understanding of the CFTR structure, its expression, and defined cellular compositions will aid in developing more precise therapies. As the lifespan of CF patients continues to increase, it is becoming critical to clinically address the extra-pulmonary manifestations of CF disease to improve the quality of life of the patients. In-depth analysis of the molecular signature of different CF organs at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels is rapidly advancing and will help address the etiological causes and variability of CF among patients and develop precision medicine in CF. In this review, we will provide an overview of CF disease, leading to the discovery and characterization of CFTR and the development of CFTR modulators. The later sections of the review will delve into the key findings derived from single-molecule and single-cell-level analyses of CFTR, followed by an exploration of disease-relevant protein complexes of CFTR that may ultimately define the etiological course of CF disease.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Despite being clinically utilized for the treatment of infections, the limited therapeutic range of polymyxin B (PMB), along with considerable interpatient variability in its pharmacokinetics and frequent occurrence of acute kidney injury, has significantly hindered its widespread utilization. Recent research on the population pharmacokinetics of PMB has provided valuable insights. This study aims to review relevant literature to establish a theoretical foundation for individualized clinical management. METHODS: Follow PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, Pop-PK studies of PMB were searched in PubMed and EMBASE database systems from the inception of the database until March 2023. RESULT: To date, a total of 22 population-based studies have been conducted, encompassing 756 subjects across six different countries. The recruited population in these studies consisted of critically infected individuals with multidrug-resistant bacteria, patients with varying renal functions, those with cystic fibrosis, kidney or lung transplant recipients, patients undergoing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), as well as individuals with obesity or pediatric populations. Among these studies, seven employed a one-compartmental model, with the range of typical clearance (CL) and volume (Vc) being 1.18-2.5L /h and 12.09-47.2 L, respectively. Fifteen studies employed a two-compartmental model, with the ranges of the clearance (CL) and volume of the central compartment (Vc), the volume of the peripheral compartment (Vp), and the intercompartment clearance (Q) were 1.27-8.65 L/h, 5.47-38.6 L, 4.52-174.69 L, and 1.34-24.3 L/h, respectively. Primary covariates identified in these studies included creatinine clearance and body weight, while other covariates considered were CRRT, albumin, age, and SOFA scores. Internal evaluation was conducted in 19 studies, with only one study being externally validated using an independent external dataset. CONCLUSION: We conclude that small sample sizes, lack of multicentre collaboration, and patient homogeneity are the primary reasons for the discrepancies in the results of the current studies. In addition, most of the studies limited in the internal evaluation, which confined the implementation of model-informed precision dosing strategies.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis is a chronic genetic disease that can affect the function of the respiratory system. Previous reviews of the effects of respiratory muscle training in people with cystic fibrosis are uncertain and do not consider the effect of age on disease progression. This systematic review aims to determine the effectiveness of respiratory muscle training in the clinical outcomes of children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis. METHODS: Up to July 2023, electronic databases and clinical trial registries were searched. Controlled clinical trials comparing respiratory muscle training with sham intervention or no intervention in children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis. The primary outcomes were respiratory muscle strength, respiratory muscle endurance, lung function, and cough. Secondary outcomes included exercise capacity, quality of life and adverse events. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool 2. The certainty of the evidence was assessed according to the GRADE approach. Meta-analyses where possible; otherwise, take a qualitative approach. RESULTS: Six studies with a total of 151 participants met the inclusion criteria for this review. Two of the six included studies were published in abstract form only, limiting the available information. Four studies were parallel studies and two were cross-over designs. There were significant differences in the methods and quality of the methodology included in the studies. The pooled data showed no difference in respiratory muscle strength, lung function, and exercise capacity between the treatment and control groups. However, subgroup analyses suggest that inspiratory muscle training is beneficial in increasing maximal inspiratory pressure, and qualitative analyses suggest that respiratory muscle training may benefit respiratory muscle endurance without any adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review and meta-analysis indicate that although the level of evidence indicating the benefits of respiratory muscle training is low, its clinical significance suggests that we further study the methodological quality to determine the effectiveness of training. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The protocol for this review was recorded in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) under registration number CRD42023441829.",

However, it can be dangerous for infants and children with underlying chronic diseases. The severity of influenza depends on various factors, including the virulence of the virus strain, preexisting immunity level, and individual health conditions. The aim of this study is to describe the clinical profile of H1N1 influenza in hospitalized infants and children. METHODS: This is a prospective and descriptive study conducted from November 1, 2018, to January 31, 2024. In this study, we included all children under 14 years old hospitalized for suspected severe lower respiratory infection who had gone through virological testing. We used a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) kit: the Film Array-Respiratory Panel. Due to the depletion of multiplex PCR kits, this study continued using rapid influenza diagnostic tests based on immunochromatographic technique. RESULTS: We report 45 confirmed cases of H1N1 influenza, collected during the period from November 1, 2018, to January 31, 2024. The average age was 2 years and 4 months. The main reason for admission was respiratory distress found in all patients. In 53% of the cases, there was an associated comorbidity, including asthma (17 cases), prematurity (2 cases), congenital adrenal hyperplasia (2 cases), cystic fibrosis (1 case), undetermined etiology bronchial dilation (1 case), and Basedow's disease (1 case). The clinical presentation included viral bronchiolitis (17 cases), moderate asthma exacerbation (10 cases), severe asthma exacerbation (7 cases), pneumonia (9 cases), bronchial dilation exacerbation (1 case), and flu-like syndrome with adrenal insufficiency (1 case). Fever was present in 31 patients. Gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting were present in 20 cases. Three patients required intensive care, with 2 children being intubated and ventilated (one severe acute asthma and one severe viral bronchiolitis). Two cases were treated with oseltamivir. The average length of hospital stay was 7.5 days, ranging from 3 to 20 days. All cases showed favorable evolution. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that preventive measures remain crucial, and influenza vaccination is highly recommended in cases of underlying morbidity.",

The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Pulmonary Guidelines support the use of intravenous aminoglycosides with therapeutic drug monitoring for the treatment of pulmonary exacerbation due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Serum intravenous tobramycin concentrations are commonly collected by peripheral venipuncture (PV). Discomfort associated with collection of samples by PV prompts collection via PICC, but the accuracy of intravenous tobramycin serum levels collected by PICC has not been documented in adult PwCF. The primary study objective was to evaluate the difference between intravenous tobramycin serum levels collected by PV and PICC in adult PwCF. METHODS: The authors conducted a prospective case-control study of adult PwCF admitted to University of Utah Health for a pulmonary exacerbation receiving tobramycin by a single lumen PICC. The authors compared tobramycin peak and random serum levels collected by PV and PICC using a detailed flush and waste protocol. RESULTS: The authors analyzed a total of 19 patients with peripheral and PICC samples. The mean tobramycin peak collected by PV (27.2 mcg/mL) was similar to the mean peak collected by PICC (26.9 mcg/mL) (paired samples Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p = .94). The correlation coefficient was 0.88 (95% CI = 0.85-0.91, p < .001). CONCLUSION: Tobramycin serum samples collected by PICC appear to be similar in value to PV collections. Collecting aminoglycoside levels by PICC rather than PV may reduce patient discomfort and improve quality of life. Additional multicenter studies are needed to confirm these results.",

METHOD: A 12-year-old female (F12) and a 17-year-old male (M17), both diagnosed with cystic fibrosis and chronic P. aeruginosa lung infection, underwent bacteriophage treatment (BT). The administration involved bronchoscopic instillation and subsequent nebulisation. This was performed concurrently with intravenous antibiotics and regular physiotherapy delivered in an in-patient setting for 14 days. Microbiological, clinical, and lung function assessments were conducted to assess this treatment modality. RESULTS: No adverse events (fever, localised reaction, wheeze or bronchospasm) occurred during BT. F12 demonstrated a 4% increase, while M17 showed a 5% improvement in FEV1% from their best FEV1% over the past three years following BT. A 12% (F12) and an 8% (M17) improvement from baseline FEV1% was observed. For F12 P. aeruginosa was not isolated from her sputum despite 12 previous hospitalisations for intravenous antibiotics. CONCLUSION: Bronchoscopic and nebulised routes of bacteriophage administration were well-tolerated in these two adolescents. This early report underscores the potential of this treatment modality and encourages clinicians and researchers to actively explore this innovative approach.",

The extent of remaining healthy pancreatic parenchyma determines the risk of developing future episodes of pancreatitis, as well as pancreatic exocrine or endocrine insufficiency. Pancreatitis may be the presenting symptom of CF, and genetic testing is especially important in pediatrics. AP and recurrent AP are managed with intravenous fluid hydration and pain control, in addition to early refeeding and treatment of complications. With the use of modulator therapy in CF, pancreatic function may be restored to some extent. CP related pain is managed with analgesics and neuromodulators, with surgery if indicated in specific situations including TPIAT as a possible type of surgical intervention. Long-term sequelae of CP in patients with CF include exocrine pancreatic insufficiency treated with pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies and associated metabolic complications such as bone disease/osteoporosis, pancreatogenic diabetes, and less commonly, pancreatic cancer.

However, it can be dangerous for infants and children with underlying chronic diseases. The severity of influenza depends on various factors, including the virulence of the virus strain, preexisting immunity level, and individual health conditions. The aim of this study is to describe the clinical profile of H1N1 influenza in hospitalized infants and children. METHODS: This is a prospective and descriptive study conducted from November 1, 2018, to January 31, 2024. In this study, we included all children under 14 years old hospitalized for suspected severe lower respiratory infection who had gone through virological testing. We used a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) kit: the Film Array-Respiratory Panel. Due to the depletion of multiplex PCR kits, this study continued using rapid influenza diagnostic tests based on immunochromatographic technique. RESULTS: We report 45 confirmed cases of H1N1 influenza, collected during the period from November 1, 2018, to January 31, 2024. The average age was 2 years and 4 months. The main reason for admission was respiratory distress found in all patients. In 53% of the cases, there was an associated comorbidity, including asthma (17 cases), prematurity (2 cases), congenital adrenal hyperplasia (2 cases), cystic fibrosis (1 case), undetermined etiology bronchial dilation (1 case), and Basedow's disease (1 case). The clinical presentation included viral bronchiolitis (17 cases), moderate asthma exacerbation (10 cases), severe asthma exacerbation (7 cases), pneumonia (9 cases), bronchial dilation exacerbation (1 case), and flu-like syndrome with adrenal insufficiency (1 case). Fever was present in 31 patients. Gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting were present in 20 cases. Three patients required intensive care, with 2 children being intubated and ventilated (one severe acute asthma and one severe viral bronchiolitis). Two cases were treated with oseltamivir. The average length of hospital stay was 7.5 days, ranging from 3 to 20 days. All cases showed favorable evolution. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that preventive measures remain crucial, and influenza vaccination is highly recommended in cases of underlying morbidity.",

Invasive mechanical ventilation support may be required for the management of these patients. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a method used when ventilation support is insufficient. However, the less invasive extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal method can be used as an alternative in cases of hypercapnic respiratory failure. CASE: A 9-year-old patient with cystic fibrosis presented to the hospital with acute respiratory failure due to pneumonia. Bilateral patchy areas of consolidation were evident in the chest x-ray. Invasive mechanical ventilation support was consequently provided to treat severe hypercapnia. Although peak and plateau pressure levels exceeded 32 cmH2O (49 cmH2O) and 28 cmH2O (35 cmH2O), respectively, the patient continued to have severe respiratory acidosis. Therefore extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal support was initiated to provide lung-protective ventilation. By Day 10, venovenous ECMO support was initiated due to deteriorating oxygenation. CONCLUSION: In cases where conventional invasive mechanical ventilation support is insufficient due to acute hypercapnic respiratory failure, extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal support, which is less invasive compared to ECMO, should be considered as an effective and reliable alternative method.

These novel therapeutic approaches have permitted unprecedented opportunities for quality-of-life improvement and for enhancing people with CF's (pwCF) life expectancy. AREAS COVERED: The aim of this review is to describe the current knowledge gaps. A comprehensive search strategy was undertaken to assess impact of HEMT in life of pwCF, treatment challenges in specific populations such as very young children, and research needs. EXPERT OPINION: HEMTs are prescribed for pwCF with definite genotypes. The heterogeneity of variants complicates treatment possibilities and around 10% of pwCF worldwide remains ineligible. Genotype-specific treatments are prompting theratyping and personalized medicine strategies. Improvement in lung function and quality of life increase survival rates, shifting CF from a pediatric to an adult disease. This implies new studies addressing long-term efficacy, side effects, emergence of adult co-morbidities and possible drug-drug interactions. More sensitive and predictive biomarkers for both efficacy and toxicity are warranted. As HEMTs cross the placenta and are found in breast milk, studies addressing the potential consequences of treatment during pregnancy and breastfeeding are urgently needed. Finally, although the treatment and expected outcomes of CF have improved dramatically in high- and middle-income countries, lack of access in low-income countries to these lifesaving and life-changing medicines highlights inequity of care worldwide.",

High sweat-salt levels are observed as a result of a single autosomal mutation in chromosome 7 that affects the critical function of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR). For establishing tailored treatment strategies, it is important to understand the broad range of CFTR mutations and their impacts on disease pathophysiology. This study thoroughly investigates the six main classes of classification of CFTR mutations based on their functional effects. Each class is distinguished by distinct molecular flaws, such as poor protein synthesis, misfolding, gating defects, conduction defects, and decreased CFTR expression at the apical membrane. Furthermore, this paper focuses on the emerging field of CFTR modulators, which intend to restore CFTR function or mitigate its consequences. These modulators, which are characterized by the mode of action and targeted mutation class, have the potential to provide personalized therapy regimens in CF patients. This review provides valuable insights into the genetic basis of CF pathology, and highlights the potential for precision medicine methods in CF therapy by thoroughly investigating CFTR mutation classification and related modulators.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Elevated markers of systemic and pulmonary inflammation are associated with failure to recover lung function following pulmonary exacerbations (PExs) in people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF). Our aim was to determine whether adjuvant oral prednisone treatment would improve recovery of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (ppFEV1) in CF PExs not responding to antibiotic therapy. METHODS: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in pwCF treated with intravenous (IV) antibiotics for a PEx. At Day 7, those who had not returned to >90% baseline ppFEV1 were randomized to adjuvant prednisone 1 mg kg-1 twice daily (max 60 mg/day) or placebo for 7 days. The primary outcome was the difference in proportion of subjects who recovered >90% baseline ppFEV1 at Day 14 of IV antibiotic therapy. RESULTS: 173 subjects were enrolled, with 76 randomized. 50% of subjects in the prednisone group recovered baseline FEV1 on Day 14 compared to 39% of subjects in the placebo group for a difference of 11% (95% CI -11, 34%, p=0.34). The mean (sd) change in ppFEV1 from Day 7 to Day 14 was 6.8% predicted (8.8) in the prednisone group and 4.6% (6.9) in the placebo group (mean difference 2.2% predicted 95% CI -1.5, 5.9%, p=0.24). Time to subsequent exacerbation was not prolonged in prednisone treated subjects (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.45, 1.53; p=0.54). CONCLUSIONS: This study failed to detect a difference in ppFEV1 recovery between adjuvant oral prednisone and placebo treatment in pwCF not responding at day 7 of IV antibiotic therapy for PExs.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND End-stage renal disease is a major issue in the management of patients undergoing lung transplantation. Combined kidney-lung transplantation (CKLT) and kidney after lung transplantation (KALT) are the 2 preferred solutions to manage this situation. To evaluate these strategies, we describe kidney and lung graft outcomes and patient survival in patients managed with CKLT and KALT. MATERIAL AND METHODS We conducted a retrospective single-center cohort study. Patients who underwent a CKLT or a KALT were included in this study. Retrospective extraction of data from medical records was performed. RESULTS Seventeen patients underwent CKLT and 9 underwent KALT. Most of the patients had cystic fibrosis and presented renal failure related to anti-calcineurin toxicity. The 30-day and 1-year survival of CKLT recipients were both 75.6%. No patients with KALT died during the follow-up. Kidney graft prognosis was almost exclusively influenced by patient survival in relation to postoperative lung transplant complications. The rate of severe surgical complications was close to 60% for CKLT compared with 30% for KALT. The kidney graft function (estimated kidney graft function) did not differ according to the transplantation strategy. CONCLUSIONS KALT is a safe option, with postoperative morbidity and renal graft function identical to those of kidney transplantation in non-lung-transplanted patients. The results of CKLT depend mainly on the morbidity associated with lung transplantation but remain an attractive option for patients with respiratory failure associated with end-stage renal disease. The choice of transplant strategy must also take into account the most ethical and efficient allocation of kidney grafts.",

                    "abstract": "Gene therapy is gradually becoming a mainstream treatment modality and is no longer the preserve of large university departments whose laboratories master nucleic acid analytical procedures and whose clinical teams manage its administration. It was originally designed for genetic diseases that, because of their prevalence, were a group known as rare diseases. Gene therapy has so far been applied in children to act before the disease development. These new treatments have also begun to be applied for common diseases such as metabolic disorders (e. g. diabetes) and even for those that are increasingly affecting us, such as various malignancies and diseases of the central nervous system (e. g. Alzheimer's disease). The targets targeted by GT are genes, where pathogenic alterations in the form of pathogenic variants (formerly mutations) induce phenotypic disorders, and our aim is either to knock them out of function (e. g. haemoglobinopathies) or to replace them with genes with normal function, which we introduce into the genome using one of the appropriate vectors, such as viruses or liposomes. The process of GT can take place directly inside the patient's body (in vivo) or outside the body on isolated cells (ex vivo), which are usually stem cells (iPSCs, induced pluripotent stem cell). After treatment, these cells are returned to the patient's body to fulfil their \"destiny\". In a broader sense, GT can target the product of gene transcription, which is the messenger RNA, or the end product of gene function, such as functional proteins (eg. cystic fibrosis). Any of these approaches have been used successfully in various diseases, depending on their availability, which is determined, among other things, by the costs associated with GT or the accessibility of the target tissue. Ultimately, it is not only the validation of the efficacy and safety of GT, but also economic reasons that determine why GT has been slow to develop and is mostly undertaken only by large and wealthy institutions. Another decisive factor is that from initial experimental work through clinical trials, the whole process of its development normally takes up to a decade.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To characterise the investigations, management and ultimate diagnosis of neonates with distal intestinal obstruction. METHODS: Retrospective review of term (> 37 weeks) neonates with admission diagnosis of distal intestinal obstruction over 10 years (2012-2022). Patient pathways were identified and associations between presentations, response to treatments and outcome investigated. RESULTS: A total of 124 neonates were identified and all included. Initial management was colonic irrigation in 108, contrast enema in 4, and laparotomy in 12. Of those responding to irrigations none underwent contrast enema. Ultimately, 22 neonates proceeded to laparotomy. Overall, 106 had a suction rectal biopsy and 41 had genetic testing for cystic fibrosis. Final diagnosis was Hirschsprung disease (HD) in 67, meconium ileus with cystic fibrosis (CF) in 9, meconium plug syndrome in 19 (including 3 with CF), intestinal atresia in 10 and no formal diagnosis in 17. Median length of neonatal unit stay was 11 days (7-19). CONCLUSIONS: Initial management of neonates with distal bowel obstruction should be colonic irrigation since this is therapeutic in the majority and significantly reduces the need for contrast enema. These infants should all have suction rectal biopsy to investigate for HD unless another diagnosis is evident. If a meconium plug is passed, testing for CF is recommended. Evaluation and therapy are multimodal and time consuming, placing burden on resources and families.",

Initial findings indicate that CFTRm may have a positive impact on short-term glycemic control; however, long-term effects remain uncertain at present. METHODS: In this retrospective study, data were collected and analyzed on 15 pwCF, ages 13-37 years, started on CFTRm therapy. Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) results were compared pre- and post-CFTRm therapy. RESULTS: The 120-minute OGTT value decreased from 159.7 to 130.4 post-CFTRm (p = 0.047). The average time elapsed between the two OGTT tests was 49.87 months (ranging 9-157 months, median 38 months).

Six pwCF and NGT remained stable with no changes in glycemic statues throughout the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: CFTRm therapy may decelerate the glycemic control deterioration in pwCF over an extended period.

This triple drug is currently not indicated in liver transplant patients, as clinical trials including subjects with previous solid organ transplantation are lacking. CASE PRESENTATION: We report on a liver transplant girl with CF-related advanced pulmonary disease meeting clinical criteria for lung transplant, who started the triple modulator because she could not get on the lung transplant waiting list due to psycho-social motivations. Since initiation of ETI therapy, she has experienced a significant improvement in respiratory function and quality of life, without adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: This case shows that ETI therapy can represent a lifesaving drug for individuals without alternatives, even in liver transplant patients. The clinical benefits of the modulator overcome risks, which may be limited with a close drug monitoring of immunosuppressants serum levels and functional liver tests.",

From a transplant point of view, a multiorgan donor is considered of greatest efficiency, so that all organs that can potentially be used should be transplanted. The combination of the vast geographical territory of Russia, the shortage of actual donors, and the relatively small number of transplant centers has led to the need to transport donor lungs by air over long distances. There were already precedents in the world for remote preservation of donor organs for transplant. In this study, we have described the unique experience of remote evaluation of donor lungs with their subsequent air transportation and transplantation, which is the first such description in Russia to our knowledge. The donor lungs for lung transplant were brought from medical institutions of the Samara region to Moscow. During remote evaluation, all information was transmitted to the transplant center by providing access to the automated information system \"Organ Donation,\" which was used at that time by the service and contained all information about a potential donor in real time. The 2 transplant candidates had end-stage cystic fibrosis and severe respiratory failure; both patients underwent organ implantation from donors located outside their regions. In conditions of shortages of donor organs, long-distance transportation is a reasonable, feasible, and safe procedure.",

High sweat-salt levels are observed as a result of a single autosomal mutation in chromosome 7 that affects the critical function of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR). For establishing tailored treatment strategies, it is important to understand the broad range of CFTR mutations and their impacts on disease pathophysiology. This study thoroughly investigates the six main classes of classification of CFTR mutations based on their functional effects. Each class is distinguished by distinct molecular flaws, such as poor protein synthesis, misfolding, gating defects, conduction defects, and decreased CFTR expression at the apical membrane. Furthermore, this paper focuses on the emerging field of CFTR modulators, which intend to restore CFTR function or mitigate its consequences. These modulators, which are characterized by the mode of action and targeted mutation class, have the potential to provide personalized therapy regimens in CF patients. This review provides valuable insights into the genetic basis of CF pathology, and highlights the potential for precision medicine methods in CF therapy by thoroughly investigating CFTR mutation classification and related modulators.",

Still, it remains largely unknown how solid organ transplant and different immunosuppressive medications affect development of vaccine-induced immunity. METHODS: In this work, we monitored humoral and cellular memory responses after mRNA SARS-CoV-2 two-doses and booster doses vaccination in cystic fibrosis lung transplanted patients (CFT) and compared them with both cystic fibrosis patients without lung transplant (CF) and with kidney transplant recipients (KT). In particular, we investigated the effects of immunosuppressive regimens on immune memory to SARS-CoV-2 after mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in transplanted patients. RESULTS: Our results showed that immunocompromised transplanted patients displayed a weak cellular and humoral memory to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination. In addition, obtained data clearly demonstrate that immunosuppressive therapy regimen including antimetabolites, further reduces patients' ability to respond to vaccination at both humoral and cell-mediated level. Notably, patient treated with antimetabolites showed a lower humoral and cellular response also after a booster dose vaccination. CONCLUSION: These results, even if obtained on a small patient's cohort, question whether immunocompromised patients need interventions to improve vaccine SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine response such as additional jab or modulation of immunosuppressive therapy.",

Despite significant progress in developing CF transmembrane conductance regulator-specific treatments for CF lung disease, exploring alternative CF-targeted medications seems reasonable. We sought to evaluate the potential beneficial effects of oral benzbromarone as an adjuvant therapy in CF patients with reduced lung function. METHODS: This was a prospective open-label pilot study of oral benzbromarone (100 mg/day) administered once daily for 90 days. Patients were followed at a tertiary referral center in southern Brazil. Safety was assessed by the number of reported adverse events. Secondary objectives included percent predicted FEV1 (FEV1%) and pulmonary exacerbations. RESULTS: Ten patients were enrolled. Benzbromarone was found to be safe, with no serious drug-related adverse events. Eight patients completed the study; the median relative change in FEV1% tended to increase during the treatment, showing an 8% increase from baseline at the final visit. However, a nonparametric test showed that the change was not significant (p = 0.06). Of a total of ten patients, only one experienced at least one pulmonary exacerbation during the study. CONCLUSIONS: Oral benzbromarone appears to be safe, and improved FEV1% has been observed in patients with CF. Further assessment in larger trials is warranted to elucidate whether oral benzbromarone can be a potential adjuvant therapy for CF.",

These novel therapeutic approaches have permitted unprecedented opportunities for quality-of-life improvement and for enhancing people with CF's (pwCF) life expectancy. AREAS COVERED: The aim of this review is to describe the current knowledge gaps. A comprehensive search strategy was undertaken to assess impact of HEMT in life of pwCF, treatment challenges in specific populations such as very young children, and research needs. EXPERT OPINION: HEMTs are prescribed for pwCF with definite genotypes. The heterogeneity of variants complicates treatment possibilities and around 10% of pwCF worldwide remains ineligible. Genotype-specific treatments are prompting theratyping and personalized medicine strategies. Improvement in lung function and quality of life increase survival rates, shifting CF from a pediatric to an adult disease. This implies new studies addressing long-term efficacy, side effects, emergence of adult co-morbidities and possible drug-drug interactions. More sensitive and predictive biomarkers for both efficacy and toxicity are warranted. As HEMTs cross the placenta and are found in breast milk, studies addressing the potential consequences of treatment during pregnancy and breastfeeding are urgently needed. Finally, although the treatment and expected outcomes of CF have improved dramatically in high- and middle-income countries, lack of access in low-income countries to these lifesaving and life-changing medicines highlights inequity of care worldwide.",

Still, it remains largely unknown how solid organ transplant and different immunosuppressive medications affect development of vaccine-induced immunity. METHODS: In this work, we monitored humoral and cellular memory responses after mRNA SARS-CoV-2 two-doses and booster doses vaccination in cystic fibrosis lung transplanted patients (CFT) and compared them with both cystic fibrosis patients without lung transplant (CF) and with kidney transplant recipients (KT). In particular, we investigated the effects of immunosuppressive regimens on immune memory to SARS-CoV-2 after mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in transplanted patients. RESULTS: Our results showed that immunocompromised transplanted patients displayed a weak cellular and humoral memory to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination. In addition, obtained data clearly demonstrate that immunosuppressive therapy regimen including antimetabolites, further reduces patients' ability to respond to vaccination at both humoral and cell-mediated level. Notably, patient treated with antimetabolites showed a lower humoral and cellular response also after a booster dose vaccination. CONCLUSION: These results, even if obtained on a small patient's cohort, question whether immunocompromised patients need interventions to improve vaccine SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine response such as additional jab or modulation of immunosuppressive therapy.",

We describe the safety, tolerability, and potential efficacy of bronchoscopic and nebulised bacteriophage administration, offering insights into a potential breakthrough for the treatment of chronic infections particularly in children and adolescents. METHOD: A 12-year-old female (F12) and a 17-year-old male (M17), both diagnosed with cystic fibrosis and chronic P. aeruginosa lung infection, underwent bacteriophage treatment (BT). The administration involved bronchoscopic instillation and subsequent nebulisation. This was performed concurrently with intravenous antibiotics and regular physiotherapy delivered in an in-patient setting for 14 days. Microbiological, clinical, and lung function assessments were conducted to assess this treatment modality. RESULTS: No adverse events (fever, localised reaction, wheeze or bronchospasm) occurred during BT. F12 demonstrated a 4% increase, while M17 showed a 5% improvement in FEV1% from their best FEV1% over the past three years following BT. A 12% (F12) and an 8% (M17) improvement from baseline FEV1% was observed. For F12 P. aeruginosa was not isolated from her sputum despite 12 previous hospitalisations for intravenous antibiotics. CONCLUSION: Bronchoscopic and nebulised routes of bacteriophage administration were well-tolerated in these two adolescents. This early report underscores the potential of this treatment modality and encourages clinicians and researchers to actively explore this innovative approach.",

We describe the safety, tolerability, and potential efficacy of bronchoscopic and nebulised bacteriophage administration, offering insights into a potential breakthrough for the treatment of chronic infections particularly in children and adolescents. METHOD: A 12-year-old female (F12) and a 17-year-old male (M17), both diagnosed with cystic fibrosis and chronic P. aeruginosa lung infection, underwent bacteriophage treatment (BT). The administration involved bronchoscopic instillation and subsequent nebulisation. This was performed concurrently with intravenous antibiotics and regular physiotherapy delivered in an in-patient setting for 14 days. Microbiological, clinical, and lung function assessments were conducted to assess this treatment modality. RESULTS: No adverse events (fever, localised reaction, wheeze or bronchospasm) occurred during BT. F12 demonstrated a 4% increase, while M17 showed a 5% improvement in FEV1% from their best FEV1% over the past three years following BT. A 12% (F12) and an 8% (M17) improvement from baseline FEV1% was observed. For F12 P. aeruginosa was not isolated from her sputum despite 12 previous hospitalisations for intravenous antibiotics. CONCLUSION: Bronchoscopic and nebulised routes of bacteriophage administration were well-tolerated in these two adolescents. This early report underscores the potential of this treatment modality and encourages clinicians and researchers to actively explore this innovative approach.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis (CF) patients are prone to recurrent multi-drug-resistant (MDR) bacterial lung infections. Under this scenario, phage therapy has been proposed as a promising tool. However, the limited number of reported cases hampers the understanding of clinical outcomes. Anti-phage immune responses have often been overlooked and only described following invasive routes of administration. METHODS: Three monophage treatments against Staphylococcus aureus and/or Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infections were conducted in cystic fibrosis patients. In-house phage preparations were nebulized over 10 days with standard-of-care antibiotics. Clinical indicators, bacterial counts, phage and antibiotic susceptibility, phage detection, and immune responses were monitored. FINDINGS: Bacterial load was reduced by 3-6 log in two of the treatments. No adverse events were described. Phages remained in sputum up to 33 days after completion of the treatment. In all cases, phage-neutralizing antibodies were detected in serum from 10 to 42 days post treatment, with this being the first report of anti-phage antibodies after nebulized therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Nebulized phage therapy reduced bacterial load, improving quality of life even without bacterial eradication. The emergence of antibodies emphasizes the importance of long-term monitoring to better understand clinical outcomes. These findings encourage the use of personalized monophage therapies in contrast to ready-to-use cocktails, which might induce undesirable antibody generation.

The extent of remaining healthy pancreatic parenchyma determines the risk of developing future episodes of pancreatitis, as well as pancreatic exocrine or endocrine insufficiency. Pancreatitis may be the presenting symptom of CF, and genetic testing is especially important in pediatrics. AP and recurrent AP are managed with intravenous fluid hydration and pain control, in addition to early refeeding and treatment of complications. With the use of modulator therapy in CF, pancreatic function may be restored to some extent. CP related pain is managed with analgesics and neuromodulators, with surgery if indicated in specific situations including TPIAT as a possible type of surgical intervention. Long-term sequelae of CP in patients with CF include exocrine pancreatic insufficiency treated with pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies and associated metabolic complications such as bone disease/osteoporosis, pancreatogenic diabetes, and less commonly, pancreatic cancer.

                    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease caused by variants in the gene encoding for the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, a chloride and bicarbonate channel. CFTR dysfunction results in a multiorgan disease with the main clinical features being exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and diffuse bronchiectasis with chronic airway infection leading to respiratory failure and premature death. Over the past decades, major progress has been made by implementing multidisciplinary care, including nutritional support, airway clearance techniques and antibiotics in specialised CF centres. The past decade has further seen the progressive development of oral medications, called CFTR modulators, for which around 80% of people with CF are genetically eligible in Europe. CFTR modulators partially restore ion transport and lead to a rapid and major improvement in clinical manifestations and lung function, presumably resulting in longer survival. CFTR modulators have been game-changing in the care of people with CF. However, many questions remain unanswered, such as the long-term effects of CFTR modulators, especially when treatment is started very early in life, or the new CF-related disease emerging due to CFTR modulators. Moreover, severe complications of CF, such as diabetes or cirrhosis, are not reversed on CFTR modulators and around 20% of people with CF bear CFTR variants leading to a CFTR protein that is unresponsive to CFTR modulators. Challenges also arise in adapting CF care to a changing disease. In this review article, we highlight the new questions and challenges emerging from this revolution in CF care.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Impaired glycemic control and the subsequent development of Cystic fibrosis Related Diabetes (CFRD) are prevalent complications, affecting up to 50% of adults with cystic fibrosis (CF). CFTR modulator (CFTRm) therapies improve pulmonary functions, reduce exacerbation rates, increase survival in people with CF (pwCF) and appear to have a positive effect on extrapulmonary manifestations, such as nutritional state, improvements in upper respiratory symptoms, and quality of life. Initial findings indicate that CFTRm may have a positive impact on short-term glycemic control; however, long-term effects remain uncertain at present. METHODS: In this retrospective study, data were collected and analyzed on 15 pwCF, ages 13-37 years, started on CFTRm therapy. Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) results were compared pre- and post-CFTRm therapy. RESULTS: The 120-minute OGTT value decreased from 159.7 to 130.4 post-CFTRm (p = 0.047). The average time elapsed between the two OGTT tests was 49.87 months (ranging 9-157 months, median 38 months). Glycemic status improved in six pwCF (two CFRD to normal (NGT)/indeterminate (INDET) glucose tolerance; two impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) to INDET; two INDET to NGT) and worsened in one (IGT to CFRD). Six pwCF and NGT remained stable with no changes in glycemic statues throughout the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: CFTRm therapy may decelerate the glycemic control deterioration in pwCF over an extended period. These findings indicate the need for periodic OGTTs following the initiation of CFTRm therapy to appropriately adjust insulin requirements and prevent hypoglycemia. Further larger cohorts are required to authenticate and substantiate these findings.",

CFRD has been correlated with important clinical outcomes, including poor nutrition, reduced pulmonary function, and earlier mortality. However, clinical decline due to abnormalities of blood glucose (dysglycemia) begins early in CF, before the diagnosis of CFRD by the gold-standard oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) has been validated in patients with CF and has been recognized as a valuable tool in detecting early glucose abnormalities in patients with CF. Several CGM parameters have been used to predict CFRD in some but not all studies, and there is no consensus regarding CGM use for diagnostic purposes. Thus, it remains a complementary test to OGTT in CFRD diagnosis. The aim of this review is to provide an update on the pathophysiological mechanisms of CFRD, recent advances in the use of CGM for CFRD screening, and the association between CGM measures and CF-related clinical outcomes.",

Our aim was to determine whether adjuvant oral prednisone treatment would improve recovery of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (ppFEV1) in CF PExs not responding to antibiotic therapy. METHODS: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in pwCF treated with intravenous (IV) antibiotics for a PEx. At Day 7, those who had not returned to >90% baseline ppFEV1 were randomized to adjuvant prednisone 1 mg kg-1 twice daily (max 60 mg/day) or placebo for 7 days. The primary outcome was the difference in proportion of subjects who recovered >90% baseline ppFEV1 at Day 14 of IV antibiotic therapy. RESULTS: 173 subjects were enrolled, with 76 randomized. 50% of subjects in the prednisone group recovered baseline FEV1 on Day 14 compared to 39% of subjects in the placebo group for a difference of 11% (95% CI -11, 34%, p=0.34). The mean (sd) change in ppFEV1 from Day 7 to Day 14 was 6.8% predicted (8.8) in the prednisone group and 4.6% (6.9) in the placebo group (mean difference 2.2% predicted 95% CI -1.5, 5.9%, p=0.24). Time to subsequent exacerbation was not prolonged in prednisone treated subjects (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.45, 1.53; p=0.54). CONCLUSIONS: This study failed to detect a difference in ppFEV1 recovery between adjuvant oral prednisone and placebo treatment in pwCF not responding at day 7 of IV antibiotic therapy for PExs.",

From a transplant point of view, a multiorgan donor is considered of greatest efficiency, so that all organs that can potentially be used should be transplanted. The combination of the vast geographical territory of Russia, the shortage of actual donors, and the relatively small number of transplant centers has led to the need to transport donor lungs by air over long distances. There were already precedents in the world for remote preservation of donor organs for transplant. In this study, we have described the unique experience of remote evaluation of donor lungs with their subsequent air transportation and transplantation, which is the first such description in Russia to our knowledge. The donor lungs for lung transplant were brought from medical institutions of the Samara region to Moscow. During remote evaluation, all information was transmitted to the transplant center by providing access to the automated information system \"Organ Donation,\" which was used at that time by the service and contained all information about a potential donor in real time. The 2 transplant candidates had end-stage cystic fibrosis and severe respiratory failure; both patients underwent organ implantation from donors located outside their regions. In conditions of shortages of donor organs, long-distance transportation is a reasonable, feasible, and safe procedure.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A 21-year-old woman diagnosed with cystic fibrosis developed cirrhosis, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. The patient qualified for double organ liver-pancreas transplantation beyond typical indications. The respiratory symptoms of cystic fibrosis were moderate and well-treated. The patient was endangered mainly by liver insufficiency and recurrent hypoglycemia, which was due to the treatment of diabetes with high doses of insulin. Computed tomography showed mild bronchiectasis, cirrhotic liver, splenomegaly, and atrophy of the pancreas. Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonized the upper respiratory tract. Gastrointestinal complications were sufficient for the patient to be qualified for combined liver-pancreas transplantation. METHODS: First, a standard hepatectomy was performed. The liver was transplanted orthotopically. Subsequently, the team performed pancreas transplantation through a separate incision. The donor's duodenum was anastomosed to the recipient's jejunum, close to the ligament of Treitz. RESULTS: No serious complications were noted during the postoperative period. Transplanted organs started functioning without delay. The patient was discharged after 6 weeks in general good condition. Twenty months later, the patient felt well, and the grafts kept functioning properly. CONCLUSION: Combined liver-pancreas transplantation in patients with CF restores exocrine and endocrine pancreatic function and minimizes the risk of life-threatening complications associated with liver insufficiency. Improvement of life quality coincides with the possibility of discontinuing insulin and pancreatic enzyme supplementation. The combination of liver and pancreas transplantation may prevent advanced pulmonary complications, extend the prognosis of survival, and improve the long-term life quality.",

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used electronic medical record data. Eligible patients (N = 2445) were aged >=18 years and diagnosed with non-cystic fibrosis CP between January 2005 and December 2018, with >=6 months' follow-up; study initiation was first encounter with the healthcare system. Patients in the PERT group were prescribed PERT at >=1 encounter; patients in the non-PERT group were not prescribed PERT at any encounter. RESULTS: In total, 62,899 encounters were reviewed (PERT, n = 22,935; non-PERT, n = 39,964). More patients in the PERT group were younger, male, White, married/partnered and with private insurance than those in the non-PERT group. They also received longer care and had more overall encounters, fewer outpatient and day surgery/24-hour observation encounters, and more inpatient encounters. Emergency room encounters were similar between groups. Average cost by encounter was similar between groups ($225 and $213, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Despite similar average costs per encounter, the groups had very different encounter types. More inferential research on PERT use among patients with CP is needed, particularly regarding resource utilization and long-term outcomes.",

The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Pulmonary Guidelines support the use of intravenous aminoglycosides with therapeutic drug monitoring for the treatment of pulmonary exacerbation due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Serum intravenous tobramycin concentrations are commonly collected by peripheral venipuncture (PV). Discomfort associated with collection of samples by PV prompts collection via PICC, but the accuracy of intravenous tobramycin serum levels collected by PICC has not been documented in adult PwCF. The primary study objective was to evaluate the difference between intravenous tobramycin serum levels collected by PV and PICC in adult PwCF. METHODS: The authors conducted a prospective case-control study of adult PwCF admitted to University of Utah Health for a pulmonary exacerbation receiving tobramycin by a single lumen PICC. The authors compared tobramycin peak and random serum levels collected by PV and PICC using a detailed flush and waste protocol. RESULTS: The authors analyzed a total of 19 patients with peripheral and PICC samples. The mean tobramycin peak collected by PV (27.2 mcg/mL) was similar to the mean peak collected by PICC (26.9 mcg/mL) (paired samples Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p = .94). The correlation coefficient was 0.88 (95% CI = 0.85-0.91, p < .001). CONCLUSION: Tobramycin serum samples collected by PICC appear to be similar in value to PV collections.

These infections still remain an important issue, despite the therapy for CF having considerably improved in recent years. Moreover, prolonged exposure to antibiotics in combination favors the development and spread of multi-resistant bacteria; thus, the development of alternative strategies is crucial to counter antimicrobial resistance. In this context, phage therapy, i.e., the use of phages, viruses that specifically infect bacteria, has become a promising strategy. In this review, we aim to address the current status of phage therapy in the management of multidrug-resistant infections, from compassionate use cases to ongoing clinical trials, as well as the challenges this approach presents in the particular context of CF patients.",

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the effect of telehealth-based exercise training using different modalities (combined exercise training group, CombG, core stabilization exercise group, SG), in comparison with control group (CG), on exercise capacity, oxidative stress, and irisin in children with CF. METHODS: Thirty-nine children with CF (mean age=11.41+-2.18 years, mean FEV1(z-score)=-0.66+-1.96) were included in the study. The children were randomly allocated to groups. The CombG and SG performed core stabilization exercises (CS) 3 days per week for 8 weeks. The CombG also performed aerobic exercises 3 days per week in addition to CS. Physical activity (PA) recommendations were provided to the CG. Exercise capacity was evaluated using the Modified Shuttle Test (MST). Oxidative stress was assessed using total antioxidant status (TAS), total oxidant status (TOS), Oxidative Stress Index (OSI), malondialdehyde (MDA), and superoxide dismutase (SOD). The irisin level was also measured. RESULTS: Children's baseline sex, age, BMI, and FEV1 z-scores were similar (p > 0.05). The MST distance (p = 0.047,np2=0.157) and%MST distance (p = 0.045, np2=0.159) significantly improved in the CombG compared with the SG and CG. Although TAS and SOD decreased over time (p < 0.05), no significant changes were observed for TAS, TOS, OSI, MDA, SOD, and irisin parameters between the groups after training (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Combining aerobic exercise training with core stabilization applied using telehealth improved exercise capacity more than core stabilitation training only or PA recommendations in children with CF.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Despite being clinically utilized for the treatment of infections, the limited therapeutic range of polymyxin B (PMB), along with considerable interpatient variability in its pharmacokinetics and frequent occurrence of acute kidney injury, has significantly hindered its widespread utilization. Recent research on the population pharmacokinetics of PMB has provided valuable insights. This study aims to review relevant literature to establish a theoretical foundation for individualized clinical management. METHODS: Follow PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, Pop-PK studies of PMB were searched in PubMed and EMBASE database systems from the inception of the database until March 2023. RESULT: To date, a total of 22 population-based studies have been conducted, encompassing 756 subjects across six different countries. The recruited population in these studies consisted of critically infected individuals with multidrug-resistant bacteria, patients with varying renal functions, those with cystic fibrosis, kidney or lung transplant recipients, patients undergoing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), as well as individuals with obesity or pediatric populations. Among these studies, seven employed a one-compartmental model, with the range of typical clearance (CL) and volume (Vc) being 1.18-2.5L /h and 12.09-47.2 L, respectively. Fifteen studies employed a two-compartmental model, with the ranges of the clearance (CL) and volume of the central compartment (Vc), the volume of the peripheral compartment (Vp), and the intercompartment clearance (Q) were 1.27-8.65 L/h, 5.47-38.6 L, 4.52-174.69 L, and 1.34-24.3 L/h, respectively. Primary covariates identified in these studies included creatinine clearance and body weight, while other covariates considered were CRRT, albumin, age, and SOFA scores. Internal evaluation was conducted in 19 studies, with only one study being externally validated using an independent external dataset. CONCLUSION: We conclude that small sample sizes, lack of multicentre collaboration, and patient homogeneity are the primary reasons for the discrepancies in the results of the current studies. In addition, most of the studies limited in the internal evaluation, which confined the implementation of model-informed precision dosing strategies.",

Combined kidney-lung transplantation (CKLT) and kidney after lung transplantation (KALT) are the 2 preferred solutions to manage this situation. To evaluate these strategies, we describe kidney and lung graft outcomes and patient survival in patients managed with CKLT and KALT. MATERIAL AND METHODS We conducted a retrospective single-center cohort study. Patients who underwent a CKLT or a KALT were included in this study. Retrospective extraction of data from medical records was performed. RESULTS Seventeen patients underwent CKLT and 9 underwent KALT. Most of the patients had cystic fibrosis and presented renal failure related to anti-calcineurin toxicity. The 30-day and 1-year survival of CKLT recipients were both 75.6%. No patients with KALT died during the follow-up. Kidney graft prognosis was almost exclusively influenced by patient survival in relation to postoperative lung transplant complications. The rate of severe surgical complications was close to 60% for CKLT compared with 30% for KALT. The kidney graft function (estimated kidney graft function) did not differ according to the transplantation strategy. CONCLUSIONS KALT is a safe option, with postoperative morbidity and renal graft function identical to those of kidney transplantation in non-lung-transplanted patients. The results of CKLT depend mainly on the morbidity associated with lung transplantation but remain an attractive option for patients with respiratory failure associated with end-stage renal disease. The choice of transplant strategy must also take into account the most ethical and efficient allocation of kidney grafts.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Impaired glycemic control and the subsequent development of Cystic fibrosis Related Diabetes (CFRD) are prevalent complications, affecting up to 50% of adults with cystic fibrosis (CF). CFTR modulator (CFTRm) therapies improve pulmonary functions, reduce exacerbation rates, increase survival in people with CF (pwCF) and appear to have a positive effect on extrapulmonary manifestations, such as nutritional state, improvements in upper respiratory symptoms, and quality of life. Initial findings indicate that CFTRm may have a positive impact on short-term glycemic control; however, long-term effects remain uncertain at present. METHODS: In this retrospective study, data were collected and analyzed on 15 pwCF, ages 13-37 years, started on CFTRm therapy. Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) results were compared pre- and post-CFTRm therapy. RESULTS: The 120-minute OGTT value decreased from 159.7 to 130.4 post-CFTRm (p = 0.047). The average time elapsed between the two OGTT tests was 49.87 months (ranging 9-157 months, median 38 months). Glycemic status improved in six pwCF (two CFRD to normal (NGT)/indeterminate (INDET) glucose tolerance; two impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) to INDET; two INDET to NGT) and worsened in one (IGT to CFRD). Six pwCF and NGT remained stable with no changes in glycemic statues throughout the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: CFTRm therapy may decelerate the glycemic control deterioration in pwCF over an extended period. These findings indicate the need for periodic OGTTs following the initiation of CFTRm therapy to appropriately adjust insulin requirements and prevent hypoglycemia. Further larger cohorts are required to authenticate and substantiate these findings.",

High sweat-salt levels are observed as a result of a single autosomal mutation in chromosome 7 that affects the critical function of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR). For establishing tailored treatment strategies, it is important to understand the broad range of CFTR mutations and their impacts on disease pathophysiology. This study thoroughly investigates the six main classes of classification of CFTR mutations based on their functional effects. Each class is distinguished by distinct molecular flaws, such as poor protein synthesis, misfolding, gating defects, conduction defects, and decreased CFTR expression at the apical membrane. Furthermore, this paper focuses on the emerging field of CFTR modulators, which intend to restore CFTR function or mitigate its consequences. These modulators, which are characterized by the mode of action and targeted mutation class, have the potential to provide personalized therapy regimens in CF patients. This review provides valuable insights into the genetic basis of CF pathology, and highlights the potential for precision medicine methods in CF therapy by thoroughly investigating CFTR mutation classification and related modulators.",

Low socio-economic status and food deprivation are recognized as the most prevalent reasons for MN deficiencies world-wide.

                    "abstract": "Antibiotic-resistant bacteria associated with LRTIs are frequently associated with inefficient treatment outcomes. Antibiotic-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus, infections are strongly associated with pulmonary exacerbations and require frequent hospital admissions, usually following failed management in the community. These bacteria are difficult to treat as they demonstrate multiple adaptational mechanisms including biofilm formation to resist antibiotic threats. Currently, many patients with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF), non-CF bronchiectasis (NCFB) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) experience exacerbations of their lung disease and require high doses of systemically administered antibiotics to achieve meaningful clinical effects, but even with high systemic doses penetration of antibiotic into the site of infection within the lung is suboptimal. Pulmonary drug delivery technology that reliably deliver antibacterials directly into the infected cells of the lungs and penetrate bacterial biofilms to provide therapeutic doses with a greatly reduced risk of systemic adverse effects. Inhaled liposomal-packaged antibiotic with biofilm-dissolving drugs offer the opportunity for targeted, and highly effective antibacterial therapeutics in the lungs. Although the challenges with development of some inhaled antibiotics and their clinicals trials have been studied; however, only few inhaled products are available on market. This review addresses the current treatment challenges of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the lung with some clinical outcomes and provides future directions with innovative ideas on new inhaled formulations and delivery technology that promise enhanced killing of antibiotic-resistant biofilm-dwelling bacteria.",

This study aims to assess adherence to chest physiotherapy in adults with cystic fibrosis who not treated with tritherapy and to analyze the impact of certain factors on adherence. METHODS: Thus is a cross-sectional study, conducted using a questionnaire and a physiotherapy evaluation. Adherence to this treatment was measured in terms of quantitative and qualitative aspects. The impact on adherence of 15 factors was then assessed. RESULTS: Only 47% of patients could be considered as adherent, with a significant disparity between a quantitative and qualitative assessment. Gender, working time, pathology severity, the fact of being regularly followed by a physiotherapist, the perceived benefit of the sessions and their replacement by physical activity, seem associated with adherence to this treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Taking into account the qualitative aspect of the sessions, our study reveals a low rate, in our cohort, of adherence to respiratory physiotherapy, and highlights six factors likely to predominate. Regular follow-up by a physiotherapist seems to be a determining factor in adherence to this treatment.",

From a transplant point of view, a multiorgan donor is considered of greatest efficiency, so that all organs that can potentially be used should be transplanted. The combination of the vast geographical territory of Russia, the shortage of actual donors, and the relatively small number of transplant centers has led to the need to transport donor lungs by air over long distances. There were already precedents in the world for remote preservation of donor organs for transplant. In this study, we have described the unique experience of remote evaluation of donor lungs with their subsequent air transportation and transplantation, which is the first such description in Russia to our knowledge. The donor lungs for lung transplant were brought from medical institutions of the Samara region to Moscow. During remote evaluation, all information was transmitted to the transplant center by providing access to the automated information system \"Organ Donation,\" which was used at that time by the service and contained all information about a potential donor in real time. The 2 transplant candidates had end-stage cystic fibrosis and severe respiratory failure; both patients underwent organ implantation from donors located outside their regions. In conditions of shortages of donor organs, long-distance transportation is a reasonable, feasible, and safe procedure.",

Combined kidney-lung transplantation (CKLT) and kidney after lung transplantation (KALT) are the 2 preferred solutions to manage this situation. To evaluate these strategies, we describe kidney and lung graft outcomes and patient survival in patients managed with CKLT and KALT. MATERIAL AND METHODS We conducted a retrospective single-center cohort study. Patients who underwent a CKLT or a KALT were included in this study. Retrospective extraction of data from medical records was performed. RESULTS Seventeen patients underwent CKLT and 9 underwent KALT. Most of the patients had cystic fibrosis and presented renal failure related to anti-calcineurin toxicity. The 30-day and 1-year survival of CKLT recipients were both 75.6%. No patients with KALT died during the follow-up. Kidney graft prognosis was almost exclusively influenced by patient survival in relation to postoperative lung transplant complications. The rate of severe surgical complications was close to 60% for CKLT compared with 30% for KALT. The kidney graft function (estimated kidney graft function) did not differ according to the transplantation strategy. CONCLUSIONS KALT is a safe option, with postoperative morbidity and renal graft function identical to those of kidney transplantation in non-lung-transplanted patients. The results of CKLT depend mainly on the morbidity associated with lung transplantation but remain an attractive option for patients with respiratory failure associated with end-stage renal disease. The choice of transplant strategy must also take into account the most ethical and efficient allocation of kidney grafts.",

Previous reviews of the effects of respiratory muscle training in people with cystic fibrosis are uncertain and do not consider the effect of age on disease progression. This systematic review aims to determine the effectiveness of respiratory muscle training in the clinical outcomes of children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis. METHODS: Up to July 2023, electronic databases and clinical trial registries were searched. Controlled clinical trials comparing respiratory muscle training with sham intervention or no intervention in children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis. The primary outcomes were respiratory muscle strength, respiratory muscle endurance, lung function, and cough. Secondary outcomes included exercise capacity, quality of life and adverse events. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool 2. The certainty of the evidence was assessed according to the GRADE approach. Meta-analyses where possible; otherwise, take a qualitative approach. RESULTS: Six studies with a total of 151 participants met the inclusion criteria for this review. Two of the six included studies were published in abstract form only, limiting the available information. Four studies were parallel studies and two were cross-over designs. There were significant differences in the methods and quality of the methodology included in the studies. The pooled data showed no difference in respiratory muscle strength, lung function, and exercise capacity between the treatment and control groups. However, subgroup analyses suggest that inspiratory muscle training is beneficial in increasing maximal inspiratory pressure, and qualitative analyses suggest that respiratory muscle training may benefit respiratory muscle endurance without any adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review and meta-analysis indicate that although the level of evidence indicating the benefits of respiratory muscle training is low, its clinical significance suggests that we further study the methodological quality to determine the effectiveness of training. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The protocol for this review was recorded in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) under registration number CRD42023441829.",

Previous reviews of the effects of respiratory muscle training in people with cystic fibrosis are uncertain and do not consider the effect of age on disease progression. This systematic review aims to determine the effectiveness of respiratory muscle training in the clinical outcomes of children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis. METHODS: Up to July 2023, electronic databases and clinical trial registries were searched. Controlled clinical trials comparing respiratory muscle training with sham intervention or no intervention in children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis. The primary outcomes were respiratory muscle strength, respiratory muscle endurance, lung function, and cough. Secondary outcomes included exercise capacity, quality of life and adverse events. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool 2. The certainty of the evidence was assessed according to the GRADE approach. Meta-analyses where possible; otherwise, take a qualitative approach. RESULTS: Six studies with a total of 151 participants met the inclusion criteria for this review. Two of the six included studies were published in abstract form only, limiting the available information. Four studies were parallel studies and two were cross-over designs. There were significant differences in the methods and quality of the methodology included in the studies. The pooled data showed no difference in respiratory muscle strength, lung function, and exercise capacity between the treatment and control groups. However, subgroup analyses suggest that inspiratory muscle training is beneficial in increasing maximal inspiratory pressure, and qualitative analyses suggest that respiratory muscle training may benefit respiratory muscle endurance without any adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review and meta-analysis indicate that although the level of evidence indicating the benefits of respiratory muscle training is low, its clinical significance suggests that we further study the methodological quality to determine the effectiveness of training.

The elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor (ETI) combination has changed respiratory management. OBJECTIVE: To investigate how the perceived treatment burden changed in 1 year of treatment with ETI. DESIGN: Prospective observational study. METHODS: Ad hoc questionnaires for the pwCF and for the caregivers of pwCF < 18 years were administered before the initiation of ETI therapy and then at 6-12 months. The Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) and the Sinonasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) were administered to explore disease-related symptoms and social limitations. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire was used to determine levels of physical activity.

RESULTS: The study included 47/184 pwCF aged 21.4 (5.7) years, who completed 1 year of ETI therapy. At 6 months, time on aerosol therapy was decreased by 2.5 (95% CI -32.9 to 27.8) min/day, time on airway clearance therapies (ACTs) was decreased by 8.8 (95% CI -25.9 to 8.3) min/day, and time for cleaning and disinfecting respiratory equipment was decreased by 10.6 (95% CI -26.5 to 5.3) min/day. At 1 year, gains in time saved were nearly 15 min/day on average. At 1 year, 5/47 (10.6%) pwCF reported that they had discontinued positive expiratory pressure mask. CONCLUSION: PwCF on ETI may note less time engaged in their daily respiratory physiotherapy routine. Nonetheless, aerosol therapy, ACTs and maintaining respiratory equipment were still perceived as time-consuming daily activities.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Cystic Fibrosis (CF) liver disease progresses to liver failure requiring transplantation in about 3 % of patients, 0.7 % of CF patients are post liver transplant. The prognosis of CF has improved with the introduction of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI). Due to the paucity of data and concerns regarding interactions with immunosuppressive drug regimens, there is no general consensus on use of ETI post liver transplantation. The aim of this review is to report the safety and efficacy of ETI in CF patients who underwent liver transplantation. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted through MEDLINE/Pubmed and EMBASE databases. English-written articles reporting clinical data on liver transplanted CF patients treated with ETI were included. Article quality was evaluated using the Critical Appraisal Checklist for Case Reports. RESULTS: Twenty cases were retrieved from 6 reports. Temporary discontinuation and/or dose reduction due to elevated transaminases was required in 5 cases. ETI restarted on a reduced dose was tolerated in 3 out of 5 patients, 1 patient tolerated full dose. Tacrolimus dose change was required in 14 cases, in 1 case ETI was discontinued due to tacrolimus toxicity. Improvement in percentage predicted FEV1 was noted in 15/19 patients (median +17 %, range 8 %-38 %). CONCLUSIONS: In the majority of liver transplanted patients ETI is well tolerated, although adverse events and liver function abnormalities may occur. Close monitoring of liver function and tacrolimus level is warranted. Significant improvement in lung function after ETI initiation is confirmed, highlighting the importance of accessing this medication for this group of patients.",

High sweat-salt levels are observed as a result of a single autosomal mutation in chromosome 7 that affects the critical function of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR). For establishing tailored treatment strategies, it is important to understand the broad range of CFTR mutations and their impacts on disease pathophysiology. This study thoroughly investigates the six main classes of classification of CFTR mutations based on their functional effects. Each class is distinguished by distinct molecular flaws, such as poor protein synthesis, misfolding, gating defects, conduction defects, and decreased CFTR expression at the apical membrane. Furthermore, this paper focuses on the emerging field of CFTR modulators, which intend to restore CFTR function or mitigate its consequences. These modulators, which are characterized by the mode of action and targeted mutation class, have the potential to provide personalized therapy regimens in CF patients. This review provides valuable insights into the genetic basis of CF pathology, and highlights the potential for precision medicine methods in CF therapy by thoroughly investigating CFTR mutation classification and related modulators.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: To analyze the knowledge, abilities, and emotional state of cystic fibrosis patients during a specific follow-up period and compare this with the recall they had of the transition (planned and gradual shift from the pediatric unit) / transfer (direct change skipping the steps recommended by the guidelines) to a specialized cystic fibrosis adult unit. METHODS: Prospective cross-sectional study with cystic fibrosis adult patients under follow-up in a specialist consultation. Group 1 were patients who transitioned and Group 2 were transferred patients. The following information was collected: sociodemographic variables, degree of knowledge, skills, and emotional state using a survey designed for this purpose (as part of the internal consistency validation process). Participants also completed the emotional subscale of Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised. Inter-group comparisons were made for the transition/transfer, at the follow-up, and during the evolution. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients were analyzed; 65.8% male; mean age 31.9 years (SD =10.1). At the transition, Group 1 (n=19; 54.3%) had greater knowledge about their medication and reduced ability to manage appointments and making decisions in comparison to Group 2 at transfer. At follow-up, Group 1 made a better report on their emotional state and significantly improved their ability to manage appointments, communication, and decision-making. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who were moved to an adult cystic fibrosis unit through transition were more knowledgeable about their medications. However, those who were transferred managed their appointments and decision-making better, but felt sadder.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis (CF) patients are prone to recurrent multi-drug-resistant (MDR) bacterial lung infections. Under this scenario, phage therapy has been proposed as a promising tool. However, the limited number of reported cases hampers the understanding of clinical outcomes. Anti-phage immune responses have often been overlooked and only described following invasive routes of administration. METHODS: Three monophage treatments against Staphylococcus aureus and/or Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infections were conducted in cystic fibrosis patients. In-house phage preparations were nebulized over 10 days with standard-of-care antibiotics. Clinical indicators, bacterial counts, phage and antibiotic susceptibility, phage detection, and immune responses were monitored. FINDINGS: Bacterial load was reduced by 3-6 log in two of the treatments. No adverse events were described. Phages remained in sputum up to 33 days after completion of the treatment. In all cases, phage-neutralizing antibodies were detected in serum from 10 to 42 days post treatment, with this being the first report of anti-phage antibodies after nebulized therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Nebulized phage therapy reduced bacterial load, improving quality of life even without bacterial eradication. The emergence of antibodies emphasizes the importance of long-term monitoring to better understand clinical outcomes. These findings encourage the use of personalized monophage therapies in contrast to ready-to-use cocktails, which might induce undesirable antibody generation.

Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an ion channel that facilitates transportation of water and salts across epithelial cell membranes through the conductance of Cl- and other anions. A dysfunctional CFTR due to abnormalities in the cftr gene causes CF, which is believed to be a rare disease in India mainly due to mis/underdiagnosis. Although numerous diagnostic methods and treatment options are available for CF globally, most of these are unaffordable for developing countries like India. Currently, CF symptoms are managed with mucolytics, antibiotics, anti-inflammatory drugs, and various CFTR modulators based on the type of defect. While a definitive cure for CF remains elusive, advancements in stem cell and gene therapies hold promise for permanent cure in the near future. In this review, we discuss the prevalence of CF cases in India, affordable diagnostic methods, and treatment options amenable for developing countries. We further emphasize the scope for the universal newborn screening programme.",

                    "abstract": "The major cause of mortality in people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) is progressive lung disease characterised by acute and chronic infections, the accumulation of mucus, airway inflammation, structural damage and pulmonary exacerbations. The prevalence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa rises rapidly in the teenage years, and this organism is the most common cause of chronic lung infection in adults with cystic fibrosis (CF). It is associated with an accelerated decline in lung function and premature death. New P. aeruginosa infections are treated with antibiotics to eradicate the organism, while chronic infections require long-term inhaled antibiotic therapy. The prevalence of P. aeruginosa infections has decreased in CF registries since the introduction of CF transmembrane conductance regulator modulators (CFTRm), but clinical observations suggest that chronic P. aeruginosa infections usually persist in patients receiving CFTRm. This indicates that pwCF may still need inhaled antibiotics in the CFTRm era to maintain long-term control of P. aeruginosa infections. Here, we provide an overview of the changing perceptions of P. aeruginosa infection management, including considerations on detection and treatment, the therapy burden associated with inhaled antibiotics and the potential effects of CFTRm on the lung microbiome. We conclude that updated guidance is required on the diagnosis and management of P. aeruginosa infection. In particular, we highlight a need for prospective studies to evaluate the consequences of stopping inhaled antibiotic therapy in pwCF who have chronic P. aeruginosa infection and are receiving CFTRm. This will help inform new guidelines on the use of antibiotics alongside CFTRm.",

These novel therapeutic approaches have permitted unprecedented opportunities for quality-of-life improvement and for enhancing people with CF's (pwCF) life expectancy. AREAS COVERED: The aim of this review is to describe the current knowledge gaps. A comprehensive search strategy was undertaken to assess impact of HEMT in life of pwCF, treatment challenges in specific populations such as very young children, and research needs. EXPERT OPINION: HEMTs are prescribed for pwCF with definite genotypes. The heterogeneity of variants complicates treatment possibilities and around 10% of pwCF worldwide remains ineligible. Genotype-specific treatments are prompting theratyping and personalized medicine strategies. Improvement in lung function and quality of life increase survival rates, shifting CF from a pediatric to an adult disease. This implies new studies addressing long-term efficacy, side effects, emergence of adult co-morbidities and possible drug-drug interactions. More sensitive and predictive biomarkers for both efficacy and toxicity are warranted. As HEMTs cross the placenta and are found in breast milk, studies addressing the potential consequences of treatment during pregnancy and breastfeeding are urgently needed. Finally, although the treatment and expected outcomes of CF have improved dramatically in high- and middle-income countries, lack of access in low-income countries to these lifesaving and life-changing medicines highlights inequity of care worldwide.",

METHODS: Retrospective review of term (> 37 weeks) neonates with admission diagnosis of distal intestinal obstruction over 10 years (2012-2022). Patient pathways were identified and associations between presentations, response to treatments and outcome investigated. RESULTS: A total of 124 neonates were identified and all included. Initial management was colonic irrigation in 108, contrast enema in 4, and laparotomy in 12. Of those responding to irrigations none underwent contrast enema. Ultimately, 22 neonates proceeded to laparotomy. Overall, 106 had a suction rectal biopsy and 41 had genetic testing for cystic fibrosis. Final diagnosis was Hirschsprung disease (HD) in 67, meconium ileus with cystic fibrosis (CF) in 9, meconium plug syndrome in 19 (including 3 with CF), intestinal atresia in 10 and no formal diagnosis in 17. Median length of neonatal unit stay was 11 days (7-19). CONCLUSIONS: Initial management of neonates with distal bowel obstruction should be colonic irrigation since this is therapeutic in the majority and significantly reduces the need for contrast enema. These infants should all have suction rectal biopsy to investigate for HD unless another diagnosis is evident. If a meconium plug is passed, testing for CF is recommended. Evaluation and therapy are multimodal and time consuming, placing burden on resources and families.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A 21-year-old woman diagnosed with cystic fibrosis developed cirrhosis, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. The patient qualified for double organ liver-pancreas transplantation beyond typical indications. The respiratory symptoms of cystic fibrosis were moderate and well-treated. The patient was endangered mainly by liver insufficiency and recurrent hypoglycemia, which was due to the treatment of diabetes with high doses of insulin. Computed tomography showed mild bronchiectasis, cirrhotic liver, splenomegaly, and atrophy of the pancreas. Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonized the upper respiratory tract. Gastrointestinal complications were sufficient for the patient to be qualified for combined liver-pancreas transplantation. METHODS: First, a standard hepatectomy was performed. The liver was transplanted orthotopically. Subsequently, the team performed pancreas transplantation through a separate incision. The donor's duodenum was anastomosed to the recipient's jejunum, close to the ligament of Treitz. RESULTS: No serious complications were noted during the postoperative period. Transplanted organs started functioning without delay. The patient was discharged after 6 weeks in general good condition. Twenty months later, the patient felt well, and the grafts kept functioning properly. CONCLUSION: Combined liver-pancreas transplantation in patients with CF restores exocrine and endocrine pancreatic function and minimizes the risk of life-threatening complications associated with liver insufficiency. Improvement of life quality coincides with the possibility of discontinuing insulin and pancreatic enzyme supplementation. The combination of liver and pancreas transplantation may prevent advanced pulmonary complications, extend the prognosis of survival, and improve the long-term life quality.",

Administration of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) with nighttime feedings is fraught with challenges. RELiZORB (Alcresta Therapeutics, Inc), an in-line lipase cartridge, delivers PERT continuously with enteral feedings. Outcomes related to the use of this in-line lipase cartridge are lesser known. This project evaluated anthropometrics related to in-line lipase cartridge use among pediatric patients with CF already receiving oral PERT therapy prior to nighttime enteral feedings. METHODS: Retrospective chart review was performed on 29 patients with CF and EPI receiving supplemental tube feedings and utilizing in-line lipase cartridge for a continuous 12 month period between 2015 and 2019. Anthropometrics were evaluated 12 months before and after initiation of in-line lipase cartridge. RESULTS: Compared with mean height z score at 6-months pre-in-line lipase cartridge, mean height z score at 6-months post-in-line-lipase cartridge (adjusted mean difference [AMD] = 0.2540; 95% CI = [0.0487, 0.4592]; P = 0.0153) and mean height z score at 12-months post-in-line lipase cartridge (AMD = 0.2684; 95% CI = [0.0203, 0.5166]; P = 0.0340) were significantly higher. Mean weight z score at 12-months post-in-line-lipase-cartridge neared statistical significance compared with 6-months pre-in-line lipase cartridge (AMD = 0.2816; 95% CI = [-0.0003, 0.5634]; P = 0.0502) when excluding seven patients with advanced lung disease (forced expiratory volume in the first second of expiration of 40%). Weight-for-length or body mass index did not significantly differ compared with pre-in-line lipase cartridge. CONCLUSION: Use of in-line lipase cartridge with enteral feeds improved anthropometrics, especially height, in pediatric patients with CF.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Despite being clinically utilized for the treatment of infections, the limited therapeutic range of polymyxin B (PMB), along with considerable interpatient variability in its pharmacokinetics and frequent occurrence of acute kidney injury, has significantly hindered its widespread utilization. Recent research on the population pharmacokinetics of PMB has provided valuable insights. This study aims to review relevant literature to establish a theoretical foundation for individualized clinical management. METHODS: Follow PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, Pop-PK studies of PMB were searched in PubMed and EMBASE database systems from the inception of the database until March 2023. RESULT: To date, a total of 22 population-based studies have been conducted, encompassing 756 subjects across six different countries. The recruited population in these studies consisted of critically infected individuals with multidrug-resistant bacteria, patients with varying renal functions, those with cystic fibrosis, kidney or lung transplant recipients, patients undergoing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), as well as individuals with obesity or pediatric populations. Among these studies, seven employed a one-compartmental model, with the range of typical clearance (CL) and volume (Vc) being 1.18-2.5L /h and 12.09-47.2 L, respectively. Fifteen studies employed a two-compartmental model, with the ranges of the clearance (CL) and volume of the central compartment (Vc), the volume of the peripheral compartment (Vp), and the intercompartment clearance (Q) were 1.27-8.65 L/h, 5.47-38.6 L, 4.52-174.69 L, and 1.34-24.3 L/h, respectively. Primary covariates identified in these studies included creatinine clearance and body weight, while other covariates considered were CRRT, albumin, age, and SOFA scores. Internal evaluation was conducted in 19 studies, with only one study being externally validated using an independent external dataset. CONCLUSION: We conclude that small sample sizes, lack of multicentre collaboration, and patient homogeneity are the primary reasons for the discrepancies in the results of the current studies. In addition, most of the studies limited in the internal evaluation, which confined the implementation of model-informed precision dosing strategies.",

                    "abstract": "Antibiotic-resistant bacteria associated with LRTIs are frequently associated with inefficient treatment outcomes. Antibiotic-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus, infections are strongly associated with pulmonary exacerbations and require frequent hospital admissions, usually following failed management in the community. These bacteria are difficult to treat as they demonstrate multiple adaptational mechanisms including biofilm formation to resist antibiotic threats. Currently, many patients with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF), non-CF bronchiectasis (NCFB) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) experience exacerbations of their lung disease and require high doses of systemically administered antibiotics to achieve meaningful clinical effects, but even with high systemic doses penetration of antibiotic into the site of infection within the lung is suboptimal. Pulmonary drug delivery technology that reliably deliver antibacterials directly into the infected cells of the lungs and penetrate bacterial biofilms to provide therapeutic doses with a greatly reduced risk of systemic adverse effects. Inhaled liposomal-packaged antibiotic with biofilm-dissolving drugs offer the opportunity for targeted, and highly effective antibacterial therapeutics in the lungs. Although the challenges with development of some inhaled antibiotics and their clinicals trials have been studied; however, only few inhaled products are available on market. This review addresses the current treatment challenges of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the lung with some clinical outcomes and provides future directions with innovative ideas on new inhaled formulations and delivery technology that promise enhanced killing of antibiotic-resistant biofilm-dwelling bacteria.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) experience increased oxidative stress. Tele-exercise can be a new method to improve exercise in CF. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the effect of telehealth-based exercise training using different modalities (combined exercise training group, CombG, core stabilization exercise group, SG), in comparison with control group (CG), on exercise capacity, oxidative stress, and irisin in children with CF. METHODS: Thirty-nine children with CF (mean age=11.41+-2.18 years, mean FEV1(z-score)=-0.66+-1.96) were included in the study. The children were randomly allocated to groups. The CombG and SG performed core stabilization exercises (CS) 3 days per week for 8 weeks. The CombG also performed aerobic exercises 3 days per week in addition to CS. Physical activity (PA) recommendations were provided to the CG. Exercise capacity was evaluated using the Modified Shuttle Test (MST). Oxidative stress was assessed using total antioxidant status (TAS), total oxidant status (TOS), Oxidative Stress Index (OSI), malondialdehyde (MDA), and superoxide dismutase (SOD). The irisin level was also measured. RESULTS: Children's baseline sex, age, BMI, and FEV1 z-scores were similar (p > 0.05). The MST distance (p = 0.047,np2=0.157) and%MST distance (p = 0.045, np2=0.159) significantly improved in the CombG compared with the SG and CG. Although TAS and SOD decreased over time (p < 0.05), no significant changes were observed for TAS, TOS, OSI, MDA, SOD, and irisin parameters between the groups after training (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Combining aerobic exercise training with core stabilization applied using telehealth improved exercise capacity more than core stabilitation training only or PA recommendations in children with CF.",

The prognosis of CF has improved with the introduction of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI). Due to the paucity of data and concerns regarding interactions with immunosuppressive drug regimens, there is no general consensus on use of ETI post liver transplantation. The aim of this review is to report the safety and efficacy of ETI in CF patients who underwent liver transplantation. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted through MEDLINE/Pubmed and EMBASE databases. English-written articles reporting clinical data on liver transplanted CF patients treated with ETI were included. Article quality was evaluated using the Critical Appraisal Checklist for Case Reports. RESULTS: Twenty cases were retrieved from 6 reports. Temporary discontinuation and/or dose reduction due to elevated transaminases was required in 5 cases. ETI restarted on a reduced dose was tolerated in 3 out of 5 patients, 1 patient tolerated full dose. Tacrolimus dose change was required in 14 cases, in 1 case ETI was discontinued due to tacrolimus toxicity. Improvement in percentage predicted FEV1 was noted in 15/19 patients (median +17 %, range 8 %-38 %). CONCLUSIONS: In the majority of liver transplanted patients ETI is well tolerated, although adverse events and liver function abnormalities may occur. Close monitoring of liver function and tacrolimus level is warranted. Significant improvement in lung function after ETI initiation is confirmed, highlighting the importance of accessing this medication for this group of patients.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: People with cystic fibrosis (PwCF) are frequently hospitalized for treatment of pulmonary exacerbation. The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Pulmonary Guidelines support the use of intravenous aminoglycosides with therapeutic drug monitoring for the treatment of pulmonary exacerbation due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Serum intravenous tobramycin concentrations are commonly collected by peripheral venipuncture (PV). Discomfort associated with collection of samples by PV prompts collection via PICC, but the accuracy of intravenous tobramycin serum levels collected by PICC has not been documented in adult PwCF. The primary study objective was to evaluate the difference between intravenous tobramycin serum levels collected by PV and PICC in adult PwCF. METHODS: The authors conducted a prospective case-control study of adult PwCF admitted to University of Utah Health for a pulmonary exacerbation receiving tobramycin by a single lumen PICC. The authors compared tobramycin peak and random serum levels collected by PV and PICC using a detailed flush and waste protocol. RESULTS: The authors analyzed a total of 19 patients with peripheral and PICC samples. The mean tobramycin peak collected by PV (27.2 mcg/mL) was similar to the mean peak collected by PICC (26.9 mcg/mL) (paired samples Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p = .94). The correlation coefficient was 0.88 (95% CI = 0.85-0.91, p < .001). CONCLUSION: Tobramycin serum samples collected by PICC appear to be similar in value to PV collections. Collecting aminoglycoside levels by PICC rather than PV may reduce patient discomfort and improve quality of life. Additional multicenter studies are needed to confirm these results.",

                    "abstract": "The major cause of mortality in people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) is progressive lung disease characterised by acute and chronic infections, the accumulation of mucus, airway inflammation, structural damage and pulmonary exacerbations. The prevalence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa rises rapidly in the teenage years, and this organism is the most common cause of chronic lung infection in adults with cystic fibrosis (CF). It is associated with an accelerated decline in lung function and premature death. New P. aeruginosa infections are treated with antibiotics to eradicate the organism, while chronic infections require long-term inhaled antibiotic therapy. The prevalence of P. aeruginosa infections has decreased in CF registries since the introduction of CF transmembrane conductance regulator modulators (CFTRm), but clinical observations suggest that chronic P. aeruginosa infections usually persist in patients receiving CFTRm. This indicates that pwCF may still need inhaled antibiotics in the CFTRm era to maintain long-term control of P. aeruginosa infections. Here, we provide an overview of the changing perceptions of P. aeruginosa infection management, including considerations on detection and treatment, the therapy burden associated with inhaled antibiotics and the potential effects of CFTRm on the lung microbiome. We conclude that updated guidance is required on the diagnosis and management of P. aeruginosa infection. In particular, we highlight a need for prospective studies to evaluate the consequences of stopping inhaled antibiotic therapy in pwCF who have chronic P. aeruginosa infection and are receiving CFTRm. This will help inform new guidelines on the use of antibiotics alongside CFTRm.",

These novel therapeutic approaches have permitted unprecedented opportunities for quality-of-life improvement and for enhancing people with CF's (pwCF) life expectancy. AREAS COVERED: The aim of this review is to describe the current knowledge gaps. A comprehensive search strategy was undertaken to assess impact of HEMT in life of pwCF, treatment challenges in specific populations such as very young children, and research needs. EXPERT OPINION: HEMTs are prescribed for pwCF with definite genotypes. The heterogeneity of variants complicates treatment possibilities and around 10% of pwCF worldwide remains ineligible. Genotype-specific treatments are prompting theratyping and personalized medicine strategies. Improvement in lung function and quality of life increase survival rates, shifting CF from a pediatric to an adult disease. This implies new studies addressing long-term efficacy, side effects, emergence of adult co-morbidities and possible drug-drug interactions. More sensitive and predictive biomarkers for both efficacy and toxicity are warranted. As HEMTs cross the placenta and are found in breast milk, studies addressing the potential consequences of treatment during pregnancy and breastfeeding are urgently needed. Finally, although the treatment and expected outcomes of CF have improved dramatically in high- and middle-income countries, lack of access in low-income countries to these lifesaving and life-changing medicines highlights inequity of care worldwide.",

AP and recurrent AP are managed with intravenous fluid hydration and pain control, in addition to early refeeding and treatment of complications. With the use of modulator therapy in CF, pancreatic function may be restored to some extent. CP related pain is managed with analgesics and neuromodulators, with surgery if indicated in specific situations including TPIAT as a possible type of surgical intervention. Long-term sequelae of CP in patients with CF include exocrine pancreatic insufficiency treated with pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies and associated metabolic complications such as bone disease/osteoporosis, pancreatogenic diabetes, and less commonly, pancreatic cancer.

Childhood interstitial lung diseases (chILD) are often diagnosed at very young age, affect the developing lung, and can have different presentations and prognosis compared to adult forms of these diseases. Also, chILD in many cases may apparently remit, and have a better response to therapy and better prognosis than adult ILD. Many affected children will reach adulthood with minimal activity or clinical remission of the disease. They need continuing care and follow-up from childhood to adulthood if the disease persists and progresses over time but also if they are asymptomatic and in full remission. Therefore, for every chILD patient an active transition process from paediatric to adult care should be guaranteed. This ERS statement provides a review of the literature and current practice concerning transition of care in chILD. It draws on work in existing transition care programs in other chronic respiratory diseases, disease-overarching transition of care programs, evidence on the impact of these programs on clinical outcomes, current evidence regarding long-term remission of chILD as well as the lack of harmonisation between the current adult ILD and chILD classifications impacting on transition of care. While the transition system is well established in several chronic diseases, such as cystic fibrosis or diabetes mellitus, we could not find sufficient published evidence on transition systems in chILD.

However, it can be dangerous for infants and children with underlying chronic diseases. The severity of influenza depends on various factors, including the virulence of the virus strain, preexisting immunity level, and individual health conditions. The aim of this study is to describe the clinical profile of H1N1 influenza in hospitalized infants and children. METHODS: This is a prospective and descriptive study conducted from November 1, 2018, to January 31, 2024. In this study, we included all children under 14 years old hospitalized for suspected severe lower respiratory infection who had gone through virological testing. We used a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) kit: the Film Array-Respiratory Panel. Due to the depletion of multiplex PCR kits, this study continued using rapid influenza diagnostic tests based on immunochromatographic technique. RESULTS: We report 45 confirmed cases of H1N1 influenza, collected during the period from November 1, 2018, to January 31, 2024. The average age was 2 years and 4 months. The main reason for admission was respiratory distress found in all patients. In 53% of the cases, there was an associated comorbidity, including asthma (17 cases), prematurity (2 cases), congenital adrenal hyperplasia (2 cases), cystic fibrosis (1 case), undetermined etiology bronchial dilation (1 case), and Basedow's disease (1 case). The clinical presentation included viral bronchiolitis (17 cases), moderate asthma exacerbation (10 cases), severe asthma exacerbation (7 cases), pneumonia (9 cases), bronchial dilation exacerbation (1 case), and flu-like syndrome with adrenal insufficiency (1 case). Fever was present in 31 patients. Gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting were present in 20 cases. Three patients required intensive care, with 2 children being intubated and ventilated (one severe acute asthma and one severe viral bronchiolitis). Two cases were treated with oseltamivir. The average length of hospital stay was 7.5 days, ranging from 3 to 20 days. All cases showed favorable evolution. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that preventive measures remain crucial, and influenza vaccination is highly recommended in cases of underlying morbidity.",

High sweat-salt levels are observed as a result of a single autosomal mutation in chromosome 7 that affects the critical function of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR). For establishing tailored treatment strategies, it is important to understand the broad range of CFTR mutations and their impacts on disease pathophysiology. This study thoroughly investigates the six main classes of classification of CFTR mutations based on their functional effects. Each class is distinguished by distinct molecular flaws, such as poor protein synthesis, misfolding, gating defects, conduction defects, and decreased CFTR expression at the apical membrane. Furthermore, this paper focuses on the emerging field of CFTR modulators, which intend to restore CFTR function or mitigate its consequences. These modulators, which are characterized by the mode of action and targeted mutation class, have the potential to provide personalized therapy regimens in CF patients. This review provides valuable insights into the genetic basis of CF pathology, and highlights the potential for precision medicine methods in CF therapy by thoroughly investigating CFTR mutation classification and related modulators.",

Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an ion channel that facilitates transportation of water and salts across epithelial cell membranes through the conductance of Cl- and other anions. A dysfunctional CFTR due to abnormalities in the cftr gene causes CF, which is believed to be a rare disease in India mainly due to mis/underdiagnosis. Although numerous diagnostic methods and treatment options are available for CF globally, most of these are unaffordable for developing countries like India. Currently, CF symptoms are managed with mucolytics, antibiotics, anti-inflammatory drugs, and various CFTR modulators based on the type of defect. While a definitive cure for CF remains elusive, advancements in stem cell and gene therapies hold promise for permanent cure in the near future. In this review, we discuss the prevalence of CF cases in India, affordable diagnostic methods, and treatment options amenable for developing countries. We further emphasize the scope for the universal newborn screening programme.",

The role of new technologies for the treatment of CFRD is little explored. The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of Advanced Hybrid Closed Loop (AHCL) systems on glycemic control in CF patients. Methods: A single-center retrospective study on CFRD patients using AHCL systems was performed. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) values and Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) metrics were collected at T0 (AHCL placement), T1 (1-month), T2 (6-months) and T3 (1-year) to evaluate glycemic control. Results: 10 patients were included in the study. Data showed a reduction of HbA1c value (7.31 +- 0.34 to 6.35 +- 1.00; p=0.03), glycemic variability (p=0.05) and insulin requirement (p=0.03). The study population reached American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommended glycemic targets at 1-year. An increase in the Time in Range (TIR) and a reduction in time in hyperglycemia were also observed, although not statistically significant. Conclusions: In patients with CFRD, the use of AHCL leads to an improvement in glycemic control in terms of HbA1c and glycemic variability. The increase in TIR and the reduction of time in hyperglycemia, although not statistically significant, are extremely encouraging from a clinical point of view.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Approximately 85% of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) have exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) with 10% requiring supplemental nighttime enteral tube feedings. Administration of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) with nighttime feedings is fraught with challenges. RELiZORB (Alcresta Therapeutics, Inc), an in-line lipase cartridge, delivers PERT continuously with enteral feedings. Outcomes related to the use of this in-line lipase cartridge are lesser known. This project evaluated anthropometrics related to in-line lipase cartridge use among pediatric patients with CF already receiving oral PERT therapy prior to nighttime enteral feedings. METHODS: Retrospective chart review was performed on 29 patients with CF and EPI receiving supplemental tube feedings and utilizing in-line lipase cartridge for a continuous 12 month period between 2015 and 2019. Anthropometrics were evaluated 12 months before and after initiation of in-line lipase cartridge. RESULTS: Compared with mean height z score at 6-months pre-in-line lipase cartridge, mean height z score at 6-months post-in-line-lipase cartridge (adjusted mean difference [AMD] = 0.2540; 95% CI = [0.0487, 0.4592]; P = 0.0153) and mean height z score at 12-months post-in-line lipase cartridge (AMD = 0.2684; 95% CI = [0.0203, 0.5166]; P = 0.0340) were significantly higher. Mean weight z score at 12-months post-in-line-lipase-cartridge neared statistical significance compared with 6-months pre-in-line lipase cartridge (AMD = 0.2816; 95% CI = [-0.0003, 0.5634]; P = 0.0502) when excluding seven patients with advanced lung disease (forced expiratory volume in the first second of expiration of 40%). Weight-for-length or body mass index did not significantly differ compared with pre-in-line lipase cartridge. CONCLUSION: Use of in-line lipase cartridge with enteral feeds improved anthropometrics, especially height, in pediatric patients with CF.",

                    "abstract": "The major cause of mortality in people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) is progressive lung disease characterised by acute and chronic infections, the accumulation of mucus, airway inflammation, structural damage and pulmonary exacerbations. The prevalence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa rises rapidly in the teenage years, and this organism is the most common cause of chronic lung infection in adults with cystic fibrosis (CF). It is associated with an accelerated decline in lung function and premature death. New P. aeruginosa infections are treated with antibiotics to eradicate the organism, while chronic infections require long-term inhaled antibiotic therapy. The prevalence of P. aeruginosa infections has decreased in CF registries since the introduction of CF transmembrane conductance regulator modulators (CFTRm), but clinical observations suggest that chronic P. aeruginosa infections usually persist in patients receiving CFTRm. This indicates that pwCF may still need inhaled antibiotics in the CFTRm era to maintain long-term control of P. aeruginosa infections. Here, we provide an overview of the changing perceptions of P. aeruginosa infection management, including considerations on detection and treatment, the therapy burden associated with inhaled antibiotics and the potential effects of CFTRm on the lung microbiome. We conclude that updated guidance is required on the diagnosis and management of P. aeruginosa infection. In particular, we highlight a need for prospective studies to evaluate the consequences of stopping inhaled antibiotic therapy in pwCF who have chronic P. aeruginosa infection and are receiving CFTRm. This will help inform new guidelines on the use of antibiotics alongside CFTRm.",

                    "abstract": "The major cause of mortality in people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) is progressive lung disease characterised by acute and chronic infections, the accumulation of mucus, airway inflammation, structural damage and pulmonary exacerbations. The prevalence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa rises rapidly in the teenage years, and this organism is the most common cause of chronic lung infection in adults with cystic fibrosis (CF). It is associated with an accelerated decline in lung function and premature death. New P. aeruginosa infections are treated with antibiotics to eradicate the organism, while chronic infections require long-term inhaled antibiotic therapy. The prevalence of P. aeruginosa infections has decreased in CF registries since the introduction of CF transmembrane conductance regulator modulators (CFTRm), but clinical observations suggest that chronic P. aeruginosa infections usually persist in patients receiving CFTRm. This indicates that pwCF may still need inhaled antibiotics in the CFTRm era to maintain long-term control of P. aeruginosa infections. Here, we provide an overview of the changing perceptions of P. aeruginosa infection management, including considerations on detection and treatment, the therapy burden associated with inhaled antibiotics and the potential effects of CFTRm on the lung microbiome. We conclude that updated guidance is required on the diagnosis and management of P. aeruginosa infection. In particular, we highlight a need for prospective studies to evaluate the consequences of stopping inhaled antibiotic therapy in pwCF who have chronic P. aeruginosa infection and are receiving CFTRm. This will help inform new guidelines on the use of antibiotics alongside CFTRm.",

Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an ion channel that facilitates transportation of water and salts across epithelial cell membranes through the conductance of Cl- and other anions. A dysfunctional CFTR due to abnormalities in the cftr gene causes CF, which is believed to be a rare disease in India mainly due to mis/underdiagnosis. Although numerous diagnostic methods and treatment options are available for CF globally, most of these are unaffordable for developing countries like India. Currently, CF symptoms are managed with mucolytics, antibiotics, anti-inflammatory drugs, and various CFTR modulators based on the type of defect. While a definitive cure for CF remains elusive, advancements in stem cell and gene therapies hold promise for permanent cure in the near future. In this review, we discuss the prevalence of CF cases in India, affordable diagnostic methods, and treatment options amenable for developing countries. We further emphasize the scope for the universal newborn screening programme.",

However, it can be dangerous for infants and children with underlying chronic diseases. The severity of influenza depends on various factors, including the virulence of the virus strain, preexisting immunity level, and individual health conditions. The aim of this study is to describe the clinical profile of H1N1 influenza in hospitalized infants and children. METHODS: This is a prospective and descriptive study conducted from November 1, 2018, to January 31, 2024. In this study, we included all children under 14 years old hospitalized for suspected severe lower respiratory infection who had gone through virological testing. We used a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) kit: the Film Array-Respiratory Panel. Due to the depletion of multiplex PCR kits, this study continued using rapid influenza diagnostic tests based on immunochromatographic technique. RESULTS: We report 45 confirmed cases of H1N1 influenza, collected during the period from November 1, 2018, to January 31, 2024. The average age was 2 years and 4 months. The main reason for admission was respiratory distress found in all patients. In 53% of the cases, there was an associated comorbidity, including asthma (17 cases), prematurity (2 cases), congenital adrenal hyperplasia (2 cases), cystic fibrosis (1 case), undetermined etiology bronchial dilation (1 case), and Basedow's disease (1 case). The clinical presentation included viral bronchiolitis (17 cases), moderate asthma exacerbation (10 cases), severe asthma exacerbation (7 cases), pneumonia (9 cases), bronchial dilation exacerbation (1 case), and flu-like syndrome with adrenal insufficiency (1 case). Fever was present in 31 patients. Gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting were present in 20 cases. Three patients required intensive care, with 2 children being intubated and ventilated (one severe acute asthma and one severe viral bronchiolitis). Two cases were treated with oseltamivir. The average length of hospital stay was 7.5 days, ranging from 3 to 20 days. All cases showed favorable evolution.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: To limit the progression of disease, people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) perform daily respiratory physiotherapy, which is perceived as the most burdensome routine in managing their condition. The elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor (ETI) combination has changed respiratory management. OBJECTIVE: To investigate how the perceived treatment burden changed in 1 year of treatment with ETI. DESIGN: Prospective observational study. METHODS: Ad hoc questionnaires for the pwCF and for the caregivers of pwCF < 18 years were administered before the initiation of ETI therapy and then at 6-12 months. The Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) and the Sinonasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) were administered to explore disease-related symptoms and social limitations. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire was used to determine levels of physical activity. Mixed-effect models were fitted to explore whether the time engaged in respiratory physiotherapy changed during 1 year. RESULTS: The study included 47/184 pwCF aged 21.4 (5.7) years, who completed 1 year of ETI therapy. At 6 months, time on aerosol therapy was decreased by 2.5 (95% CI -32.9 to 27.8) min/day, time on airway clearance therapies (ACTs) was decreased by 8.8 (95% CI -25.9 to 8.3) min/day, and time for cleaning and disinfecting respiratory equipment was decreased by 10.6 (95% CI -26.5 to 5.3) min/day. At 1 year, gains in time saved were nearly 15 min/day on average. At 1 year, 5/47 (10.6%) pwCF reported that they had discontinued positive expiratory pressure mask. CONCLUSION: PwCF on ETI may note less time engaged in their daily respiratory physiotherapy routine. Nonetheless, aerosol therapy, ACTs and maintaining respiratory equipment were still perceived as time-consuming daily activities.",

The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Pulmonary Guidelines support the use of intravenous aminoglycosides with therapeutic drug monitoring for the treatment of pulmonary exacerbation due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Serum intravenous tobramycin concentrations are commonly collected by peripheral venipuncture (PV). Discomfort associated with collection of samples by PV prompts collection via PICC, but the accuracy of intravenous tobramycin serum levels collected by PICC has not been documented in adult PwCF. The primary study objective was to evaluate the difference between intravenous tobramycin serum levels collected by PV and PICC in adult PwCF. METHODS: The authors conducted a prospective case-control study of adult PwCF admitted to University of Utah Health for a pulmonary exacerbation receiving tobramycin by a single lumen PICC. The authors compared tobramycin peak and random serum levels collected by PV and PICC using a detailed flush and waste protocol. RESULTS: The authors analyzed a total of 19 patients with peripheral and PICC samples. The mean tobramycin peak collected by PV (27.2 mcg/mL) was similar to the mean peak collected by PICC (26.9 mcg/mL) (paired samples Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p = .94). The correlation coefficient was 0.88 (95% CI = 0.85-0.91, p < .001). CONCLUSION: Tobramycin serum samples collected by PICC appear to be similar in value to PV collections. Collecting aminoglycoside levels by PICC rather than PV may reduce patient discomfort and improve quality of life. Additional multicenter studies are needed to confirm these results.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory failure is a prevalent condition in childhood with a high rate of mortality. Invasive mechanical ventilation support may be required for the management of these patients. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a method used when ventilation support is insufficient. However, the less invasive extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal method can be used as an alternative in cases of hypercapnic respiratory failure. CASE: A 9-year-old patient with cystic fibrosis presented to the hospital with acute respiratory failure due to pneumonia. Bilateral patchy areas of consolidation were evident in the chest x-ray. Invasive mechanical ventilation support was consequently provided to treat severe hypercapnia. Although peak and plateau pressure levels exceeded 32 cmH2O (49 cmH2O) and 28 cmH2O (35 cmH2O), respectively, the patient continued to have severe respiratory acidosis. Therefore extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal support was initiated to provide lung-protective ventilation. By Day 10, venovenous ECMO support was initiated due to deteriorating oxygenation. CONCLUSION: In cases where conventional invasive mechanical ventilation support is insufficient due to acute hypercapnic respiratory failure, extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal support, which is less invasive compared to ECMO, should be considered as an effective and reliable alternative method. However, it should be noted that extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal support does not affect oxygenation; it functions solely as a carbon dioxide removal system.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Influenza A (H1N1) is a contagious respiratory infection caused by the influenza A virus. In the majority of cases, H1N1 influenza is benign. However, it can be dangerous for infants and children with underlying chronic diseases. The severity of influenza depends on various factors, including the virulence of the virus strain, preexisting immunity level, and individual health conditions. The aim of this study is to describe the clinical profile of H1N1 influenza in hospitalized infants and children. METHODS: This is a prospective and descriptive study conducted from November 1, 2018, to January 31, 2024. In this study, we included all children under 14 years old hospitalized for suspected severe lower respiratory infection who had gone through virological testing. We used a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) kit: the Film Array-Respiratory Panel. Due to the depletion of multiplex PCR kits, this study continued using rapid influenza diagnostic tests based on immunochromatographic technique. RESULTS: We report 45 confirmed cases of H1N1 influenza, collected during the period from November 1, 2018, to January 31, 2024. The average age was 2 years and 4 months. The main reason for admission was respiratory distress found in all patients. In 53% of the cases, there was an associated comorbidity, including asthma (17 cases), prematurity (2 cases), congenital adrenal hyperplasia (2 cases), cystic fibrosis (1 case), undetermined etiology bronchial dilation (1 case), and Basedow's disease (1 case). The clinical presentation included viral bronchiolitis (17 cases), moderate asthma exacerbation (10 cases), severe asthma exacerbation (7 cases), pneumonia (9 cases), bronchial dilation exacerbation (1 case), and flu-like syndrome with adrenal insufficiency (1 case). Fever was present in 31 patients. Gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting were present in 20 cases. Three patients required intensive care, with 2 children being intubated and ventilated (one severe acute asthma and one severe viral bronchiolitis). Two cases were treated with oseltamivir. The average length of hospital stay was 7.5 days, ranging from 3 to 20 days. All cases showed favorable evolution. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that preventive measures remain crucial, and influenza vaccination is highly recommended in cases of underlying morbidity.",

AP and recurrent AP are managed with intravenous fluid hydration and pain control, in addition to early refeeding and treatment of complications. With the use of modulator therapy in CF, pancreatic function may be restored to some extent. CP related pain is managed with analgesics and neuromodulators, with surgery if indicated in specific situations including TPIAT as a possible type of surgical intervention. Long-term sequelae of CP in patients with CF include exocrine pancreatic insufficiency treated with pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies and associated metabolic complications such as bone disease/osteoporosis, pancreatogenic diabetes, and less commonly, pancreatic cancer.

We describe the safety, tolerability, and potential efficacy of bronchoscopic and nebulised bacteriophage administration, offering insights into a potential breakthrough for the treatment of chronic infections particularly in children and adolescents. METHOD: A 12-year-old female (F12) and a 17-year-old male (M17), both diagnosed with cystic fibrosis and chronic P. aeruginosa lung infection, underwent bacteriophage treatment (BT). The administration involved bronchoscopic instillation and subsequent nebulisation. This was performed concurrently with intravenous antibiotics and regular physiotherapy delivered in an in-patient setting for 14 days. Microbiological, clinical, and lung function assessments were conducted to assess this treatment modality. RESULTS: No adverse events (fever, localised reaction, wheeze or bronchospasm) occurred during BT. F12 demonstrated a 4% increase, while M17 showed a 5% improvement in FEV1% from their best FEV1% over the past three years following BT. A 12% (F12) and an 8% (M17) improvement from baseline FEV1% was observed. For F12 P. aeruginosa was not isolated from her sputum despite 12 previous hospitalisations for intravenous antibiotics. CONCLUSION: Bronchoscopic and nebulised routes of bacteriophage administration were well-tolerated in these two adolescents. This early report underscores the potential of this treatment modality and encourages clinicians and researchers to actively explore this innovative approach.",

AIM: To examine the use of DPP4-I therapy in patients with CFRD at a single large adult cystic fibrosis center. METHOD: People with CFRD prescribed a DPP4-I were identified from our specialist CFRD clinic and records were retrospectively examined for indication for therapy, tolerability and effectiveness. Analysis of continuous glucose monitoring data Libre 2 was done for these patients (CGM) pre and at least 3 months post therapy was performed. RESULTS: 23 people with CF (PwCF) with a mean (SD) age of 35.0 +- 2.4 years were included in this analysis . In 21 patients DPP4-I was prescribed as a monotherapy and it was given in combination with insulin in 2 others. Indications for therapy included reactive hypoglycaemia (n = 10) post prandial hyperglycaemia (8), insulin avoidance (3), metformin intolerance (1) and unclear (1). Therapy was well tolerated with no discontinuations due to adverse effects. Significant improvements were noted in Time in Range- Pre vs Post: 78.0 [67.5 - 84.0] vs 89.0 [79.8 - 96.0]%, p = 0.005, Time above Range -Pre vs Post: 19.5 [12.5 - 30.8] vs 6.0 [2.5 - 16.5]%, p = 0.006 and glucose variability Pre versus Post: 28.3 [25.4 - 31.1] vs 26.9 [23.1 - 31.3], p = 0.021, Of the 10 subjects who initiated therapy for hypoglycaemia, 7 reported an improvement in symptoms. No significant difference was found in weight pre and post: 61.5 +- 15.0 kg vs 62.5 +- 15.3 kg, p = 0.326 or Hba1c pre vs post: 41.0 [36.0 - 53.3] mmol/mol versus 40.5 [36.8 - 47.3], p = 0.727.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A 21-year-old woman diagnosed with cystic fibrosis developed cirrhosis, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. The patient qualified for double organ liver-pancreas transplantation beyond typical indications. The respiratory symptoms of cystic fibrosis were moderate and well-treated. The patient was endangered mainly by liver insufficiency and recurrent hypoglycemia, which was due to the treatment of diabetes with high doses of insulin. Computed tomography showed mild bronchiectasis, cirrhotic liver, splenomegaly, and atrophy of the pancreas. Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonized the upper respiratory tract. Gastrointestinal complications were sufficient for the patient to be qualified for combined liver-pancreas transplantation. METHODS: First, a standard hepatectomy was performed. The liver was transplanted orthotopically. Subsequently, the team performed pancreas transplantation through a separate incision. The donor's duodenum was anastomosed to the recipient's jejunum, close to the ligament of Treitz. RESULTS: No serious complications were noted during the postoperative period. Transplanted organs started functioning without delay. The patient was discharged after 6 weeks in general good condition. Twenty months later, the patient felt well, and the grafts kept functioning properly. CONCLUSION: Combined liver-pancreas transplantation in patients with CF restores exocrine and endocrine pancreatic function and minimizes the risk of life-threatening complications associated with liver insufficiency. Improvement of life quality coincides with the possibility of discontinuing insulin and pancreatic enzyme supplementation. The combination of liver and pancreas transplantation may prevent advanced pulmonary complications, extend the prognosis of survival, and improve the long-term life quality.",

Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an ion channel that facilitates transportation of water and salts across epithelial cell membranes through the conductance of Cl- and other anions. A dysfunctional CFTR due to abnormalities in the cftr gene causes CF, which is believed to be a rare disease in India mainly due to mis/underdiagnosis. Although numerous diagnostic methods and treatment options are available for CF globally, most of these are unaffordable for developing countries like India. Currently, CF symptoms are managed with mucolytics, antibiotics, anti-inflammatory drugs, and various CFTR modulators based on the type of defect. While a definitive cure for CF remains elusive, advancements in stem cell and gene therapies hold promise for permanent cure in the near future. In this review, we discuss the prevalence of CF cases in India, affordable diagnostic methods, and treatment options amenable for developing countries. We further emphasize the scope for the universal newborn screening programme.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Influenza A (H1N1) is a contagious respiratory infection caused by the influenza A virus. In the majority of cases, H1N1 influenza is benign. However, it can be dangerous for infants and children with underlying chronic diseases. The severity of influenza depends on various factors, including the virulence of the virus strain, preexisting immunity level, and individual health conditions. The aim of this study is to describe the clinical profile of H1N1 influenza in hospitalized infants and children. METHODS: This is a prospective and descriptive study conducted from November 1, 2018, to January 31, 2024. In this study, we included all children under 14 years old hospitalized for suspected severe lower respiratory infection who had gone through virological testing. We used a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) kit: the Film Array-Respiratory Panel. Due to the depletion of multiplex PCR kits, this study continued using rapid influenza diagnostic tests based on immunochromatographic technique. RESULTS: We report 45 confirmed cases of H1N1 influenza, collected during the period from November 1, 2018, to January 31, 2024. The average age was 2 years and 4 months. The main reason for admission was respiratory distress found in all patients. In 53% of the cases, there was an associated comorbidity, including asthma (17 cases), prematurity (2 cases), congenital adrenal hyperplasia (2 cases), cystic fibrosis (1 case), undetermined etiology bronchial dilation (1 case), and Basedow's disease (1 case). The clinical presentation included viral bronchiolitis (17 cases), moderate asthma exacerbation (10 cases), severe asthma exacerbation (7 cases), pneumonia (9 cases), bronchial dilation exacerbation (1 case), and flu-like syndrome with adrenal insufficiency (1 case). Fever was present in 31 patients. Gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting were present in 20 cases. Three patients required intensive care, with 2 children being intubated and ventilated (one severe acute asthma and one severe viral bronchiolitis). Two cases were treated with oseltamivir. The average length of hospital stay was 7.5 days, ranging from 3 to 20 days. All cases showed favorable evolution. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that preventive measures remain crucial, and influenza vaccination is highly recommended in cases of underlying morbidity.",

Pancreatitis may be the presenting symptom of CF, and genetic testing is especially important in pediatrics. AP and recurrent AP are managed with intravenous fluid hydration and pain control, in addition to early refeeding and treatment of complications. With the use of modulator therapy in CF, pancreatic function may be restored to some extent. CP related pain is managed with analgesics and neuromodulators, with surgery if indicated in specific situations including TPIAT as a possible type of surgical intervention. Long-term sequelae of CP in patients with CF include exocrine pancreatic insufficiency treated with pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies and associated metabolic complications such as bone disease/osteoporosis, pancreatogenic diabetes, and less commonly, pancreatic cancer.

Inflammation in both CF lung disease and NCFBE is predominantly driven by neutrophils, which release proinflammatory cytokines and granule proteins, including neutrophil serine proteases (NSPs). NSPs include neutrophil elastase, proteinase 3 and cathepsin G. An imbalance between NSPs and their antiproteases has been observed in people with CF lung disease and people with NCFBE. While the role of the protease/antiprotease imbalance is well established in both CF lung disease and NCFBE, effective therapies targeting NSPs are lacking. In recent years, the introduction of CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator therapy has immensely improved outcomes in many people with CF (pwCF). Despite this, evidence suggests that airway inflammation persists, even in pwCF treated with CFTR modulator therapy. In this review, we summarise current data on neutrophilic inflammation in CF lung disease to assess whether neutrophilic inflammation and high, uncontrolled NSP levels play similar roles in CF lung disease and in NCFBE. We discuss similarities between the neutrophilic inflammatory profiles of people with CF lung disease and NCFBE, potentially supporting a similar therapeutic approach. Additionally, we present evidence suggesting that neutrophilic inflammation persists in pwCF treated with CFTR modulator therapy, at levels similar to those in people with NCFBE. Collectively, these findings highlight the ongoing need for new treatment strategies targeting neutrophilic inflammation in CF lung disease.",

While the role of the protease/antiprotease imbalance is well established in both CF lung disease and NCFBE, effective therapies targeting NSPs are lacking. In recent years, the introduction of CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator therapy has immensely improved outcomes in many people with CF (pwCF). Despite this, evidence suggests that airway inflammation persists, even in pwCF treated with CFTR modulator therapy. In this review, we summarise current data on neutrophilic inflammation in CF lung disease to assess whether neutrophilic inflammation and high, uncontrolled NSP levels play similar roles in CF lung disease and in NCFBE. We discuss similarities between the neutrophilic inflammatory profiles of people with CF lung disease and NCFBE, potentially supporting a similar therapeutic approach. Additionally, we present evidence suggesting that neutrophilic inflammation persists in pwCF treated with CFTR modulator therapy, at levels similar to those in people with NCFBE. Collectively, these findings highlight the ongoing need for new treatment strategies targeting neutrophilic inflammation in CF lung disease.",

They had, at least, one F508del mutation. Data were collected before ETI initiation and 3, 6, and 12 months after. RESULTS: Glycemic control measured by HbA1c significantly improved by 0.3 % (0.1-0.5) after 3 months of ETI therapy (p = 0.004) and kept this improvement during follow-up (p < 0.001). The proportion of patients needing multiple daily injections of insulin was reduced by 16 % (p = 0.023). Total daily insulin dose dropped by 0.12 (0.05-0.18) UI/kg/day (p < 0.001). Data derived from Flash Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) for patients treated with insulin stayed unchanged after insulin reduction, except for a significant 8 % (0.3-15.6) increase in the Time In Tight Range (TITR) between 70 and 140 mg/dL (p = 0.043). CONCLUSION: ETI therapy impacted CFRD in clinical practice reducing insulin needs and improving glycemic control measured by HbA1c and CGM. The improvements can be observed from the first 3 months of treatment.",
