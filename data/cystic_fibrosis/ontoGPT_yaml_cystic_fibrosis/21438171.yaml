input_text: Higher tobramycin concentration and vibrating mesh technology can shorten
  antibiotic treatment time in cystic fibrosis.Poor adherence to recommended therapy
  in cystic fibrosis (CF) is often because of the time demands of therapy. Tobramycin
  (TOBI , 300 mg at 60 mg/ml) inhaled from the PARI LC PLUS  nebulizer requires about
  20 min. This study determined if equivalent levels of pulmonary deposition could
  be achieved in shorter time using 1.5 ml of 100 mg/ml tobramycin solution delivered
  by an investigational eFlow  nebulizer. Sixteen males with stable CF, 8 children
  and 8 adults, and an FEV(1)  > 45% predicted inhaled both preparations on two occasions
  with (99m) Tc-DTPA added to the tobramycin. Blood samples were taken for quantification
  of tobramycin in the serum. The PARI LC PLUS  delivered 45.4 (39.3-51.6), mean and
  95% CI, mg to the lungs in 17.0 +- 2.5 min (mean +- SD) with serum levels of 1,089
  +- 388 microg/L. The investigational eFlow  delivered 46.3(40.3-51.7) mg in 4.0
  +- 1.0 min with blood levels of 909 +- 458 microg/L. Only the time of delivery was
  significantly different with P < 0.0001 (paired t-test). Tolerability of the treatment
  was comparable for both inhalation regimes, but the shorter treatment was preferred
  by all patients. These results demonstrate the possibility of delivering equivalent
  levels of tobramycin much faster into the lungs of CF patients when using eFlow
  , a very efficient electronic nebulizer.
