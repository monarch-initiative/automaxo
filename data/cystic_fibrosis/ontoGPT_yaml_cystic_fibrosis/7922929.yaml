input_text: 'Vitamin K and the management of patients with cystic fibrosis.OBJECTIVE:
  To assess the advisability of routine vitamin K supplementation in patients with
  cystic fibrosis (CF). DATA SOURCES: Studies identified through a MEDLINE search
  with the use of MeSH terms vitamin K, cystic fibrosis, PIVKA-II (protein induced
  by vitamin K absence-II), coagulation abnormality and cystic fibrosis, and hepatic
  disorder and cystic fibrosis. STUDY SELECTION: Six articles published between January
  1981 and December 1992 were selected: one general review of vitamin K in infancy
  and five studies involving clinical trials of vitamin K supplementation or screening
  for fat-soluble vitamins, vitamin K or PIVKA-II in patients with CF. Review articles
  on nutrition in patients with CF, technical reports, letters, comments and case
  studies not bearing directly on these issues were excluded. DATA EXTRACTION: Findings
  in these articles were analysed and compared to determine whether routine supplementation
  in all patients with CF is indicated, whether specific subgroups of these patients
  are susceptible to vitamin K deficiency and areas in which future research is needed.
  RESULTS: There is no consensus on routine vitamin K supplementation in patients
  with CF. Studies have found a few cases of vitamin K deficiency among the population
  of people with CF. In addition, various factors--including pancreatic failure, liver
  disease, bowel resection and long-term use of antibiotics--can put some of these
  patients at risk of vitamin K deficiency. CONCLUSIONS: Specific indications for
  routine vitamin K supplementation in all patients with CF have not yet been identified.
  Pending further studies, it would be prudent to consider routine supplementation
  in patients with CF and severe noncholestatic and cholestatic liver disease, major
  small-bowel resection, pancreatic insufficiency or lung disease necessitating frequent
  use of antibiotics. A stronger body of evidence is needed as a basis for clinical
  strategies.'
