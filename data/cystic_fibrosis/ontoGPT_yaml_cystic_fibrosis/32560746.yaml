input_text: 'Efficacy and safety of aerosolized intra-tracheal dornase alfa administration
  in patients with SARS-CoV-2-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS):
  a structured summary of a study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.OBJECTIVES:
  Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may trigger severe
  pneumonia in coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) patients through release of
  damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and recruitment of neutrophils in the
  lungs. Activated neutrophils induce inflammation and severe alveolar injury by releasing
  neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). The backbones of many DAMPs and NETs are
  made of extracellular, cell-free DNA decorated with highly toxic compounds such
  as elastase, myeloperoxidase and citrullinated histones. Dornase alfa is a FDA-approved
  recombinant human DNAse 1 for the treatment of cystic fibrosis, which cleaves extracellular
  DNA and may break up cell-free DNA, loosening sticky mucus in the distal airways
  and reducing NETs-induced toxicity on alveolar pneumocytes. The COVIDornase trial
  intends to define the impact of aerosolized intra-tracheal dornase alfa administration
  on the severity and progression of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in
  COVID-19 patients. This drug might make lung mucus thinner and looser, promoting
  improved clearance of secretions and reduce extracellular double-stranded DNA-induced
  hyperinflammation in alveoli, preventing further damage to the lungs. TRIAL DESIGN:
  COVIDornase is a prospective, randomized, controlled, 2-arm (1:1 ratio), multicentric,
  open-label clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS: The study will recruit mechanically ventilated
  patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU) in the recruiting centres
  (at the time of writing: The Rothschild foundation hospital in Paris, the Strasbourg
  university hospitals, and Metz-Thionville hospital) who have been diagnosed with
  COVID-19 and meet ARDS criteria. INCLUSION CRITERIA: - Adult patient (age >= 18
  years old); - Hospitalized in ICU; - With severe COVID-19 pneumonia and ARDS according
  to Berlin criteria (PaO2/FiO2 < 300 and PEEP > 5 cmH2O); - Intubated for less than
  8 days; - With an anticipated duration of mechanical ventilation > 48 hours; - Carrier
  of an arterial catheter; - For whom 4 PaO2/FiO2 values over the preceding 24 hours
  are available; NON-INCLUSION CRITERIA: - Known hypersensitivity to dornase alfa
  or any of its excipients; - Pregnant or breastfeeding status; - Patient under legal
  protection. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Intervention 1, Study group Dornase alfa
  (Pulmozyme , Roche, Switzerland) will be administered by aerosol, at a dose of 2500
  IU twice daily, 12 hours apart, for 7 consecutive days, using a vibrating mesh nebulizer
  (Aerogen Solo , Aerogen, Ireland). The remainder of the management will be performed
  in accordance with good clinical practice, including mechanical ventilation (protective
  ventilation, PEEP > 5 cmH2O, tracheal balloon pressure check every 4 hours or automatic
  device, 30  head of the bed elevation, tidal volume 6-8mL/kg, plateau pressure <
  30 cmH2O), neuromuscular blockers if necessary, prone position if PaO2/FiO2 < 150,
  early enteral nutrition, glycemic control and a sedation protocol based on the RASS
  score. Intervention 2, Comparator Patients will receive usual care in accordance
  with good practice (as detailed above), without aerosols. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary
  outcome is the occurrence of at least one grade improvement between D0 (inclusion)
  and D7 in the ARDS scale severity (Berlin criteria). For instance from "severe"
  to "moderate" or from "moderate" to "mild". RANDOMISATION: All consecutive patients
  meeting the inclusion criteria will be randomised 1:1 using an eCRF-based, computer-generated
  randomisation table, either to the dornase alfa arm or to the control arm. An interim
  analysis will be performed after inclusion of 20 patients. Inclusions may be stopped
  at the interim analysis per data safety and monitoring board (DSMB) advice, if statistical
  analyses conclude on the futility or efficacy of the intervention or by other DSMB
  decision. BLINDING (MASKING): The participants and caregivers will not be blinded
  to study group assignment. Those assessing the outcomes will be blinded to study
  group assignment. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): Fifty patients will be
  randomized to each group, 100 patients in total. TRIAL STATUS: Protocol version
  number 2, April 29th, 2020. Recruitment is ongoing. The trial started recruitment
  on the 21st April 2020. We estimate recruitment will finish August 21st 2020. TRIAL
  REGISTRATION: The trial was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov on 21 April 2020, updated
  on 8 May 2020. Trial registration number is NCT04355364. FULL PROTOCOL: The full
  protocol is attached as an additional file, accessible from the Trials website (Additional
  file 1). In the interest in expediting dissemination of this material, the familiar
  formatting has been eliminated. This Letter serves as a summary of the key elements
  of the full protocol.'
