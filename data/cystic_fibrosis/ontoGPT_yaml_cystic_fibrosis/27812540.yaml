input_text: Microstructural alterations of sputum in cystic fibrosis lung disease.The
  stasis of mucus secretions in the lungs of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients leads to
  recurrent infections and pulmonary exacerbations, resulting in decreased survival.
  Prior studies have assessed the biochemical and biophysical features of airway mucus
  in individuals with CF. However, these measurements are unable to probe mucus structure
  on microscopic length scales relevant to key players in the progression of CF-related
  lung disease, namely, viruses, bacteria, and neutrophils. In this study, we quantitatively
  determined sputum microstructure based on the diffusion of muco-inert nanoparticle
  probes in CF sputum and found that a reduction in sputum mesh pore size is characteristic
  of CF patients with reduced lung function, as indicated by measured FEV1. We also
  discovered that the effect of ex vivo treatment of CF sputum with rhDNase I (Pulmozyme)
  on microstructure is dependent upon the time interval between the most recent inhaled
  rhDNase I treatment and the sample collection. Microstructure of mucus may serve
  as a marker for the extent of CF lung disease and as a parameter for assessing the
  effectiveness of mucus-altering agents.
