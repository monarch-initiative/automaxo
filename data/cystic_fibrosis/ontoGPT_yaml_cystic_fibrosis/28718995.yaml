input_text: A systematic review of the prevalence and impact of urinary incontinence
  in cystic fibrosis.This systematic review synthesizes published articles investigating
  the prevalence, severity and impact of urinary incontinence (UI), a condition associated
  with cystic fibrosis (CF). References were identified through searching Medline,
  Embase and PubMed using the medical subject headings 'cystic fibrosis' AND 'urinary
  incontinence'. Articles were included if UI prevalence was investigated as an outcome.
  Twelve studies met selection criteria. The prevalence of UI ranged from 5% to 76%.
  Age and gender contributed to this variability. When assessed, UI commonly limited
  airway clearance, exercise and/or spirometry, and had a variable impact on patients'
  lives. Worry and embarrassment were features for many; others were less affected.
  In CF, UI is common and can interfere with respiratory care and social well-being.
  The prevalence, characteristics and impact are poorly understood, which is made
  worse by inconsistent definitions across studies. Future research is needed to improve
  approaches to prevention, identification, management and education.
