input_text: 'Six-minute walk test as a determinant of the functional capacity of children
  and adolescents with cystic fibrosis: A systematic review.Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is
  a multisystem disorder. The involvement of the respiratory system is frequent and
  culminates in dyspnea and exercise intolerance. Functional capacity is an important
  diagnostic tool, because it reflects the cardiorespiratory status, quality of life
  and prognosis. This systematic review aims to assess the reproducibility and validity
  of the six minute walk test (6MWT) to reflect the functional capacity of children
  and adolescents with cystic fibrosis, and also the correlation between 6MWT and
  lung function. Searches for articles were performed in eight databases using MeSH/DeCS
  keywords. A total of 695 articles were found and, after verifying all eligibility
  criteria, six articles were included for analysis and scoring regarding the methodological
  quality according to the QUADAS scale (Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy
  Studies). All articles had good methodology (QUADAS between 9 and 11 points). The
  6MWT is not correlated with lung function. There is a strong indication that the
  6MWT is a reproducible test to assess the functional capacity of children and adolescents
  with CF. The validity assessment could not be reached because the studies included
  in this systematic review did not use adequate statistical tools to carry out such
  an evaluation.'
