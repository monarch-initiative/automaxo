input_text: Inhalable highly concentrated itraconazole nanosuspension for the treatment
  of bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.Cystic fibrosis (CF) patients are suffering from
  multiple often chronic endobronchial infection. The stiff mucus in these patients
  represents a compartment, which cannot easily be reached by systemic treatment.
  While bacterial infections are now successfully treated with repeated inhalation
  of antibiotics such as tobramycine, 57% of CF patients are colonized by Aspergillus
  species. About 10-20% of colonized patients develop symptoms of allergic bronchopulmonary
  aspergillosis (ABPA). While current standard of treatment of ABPA in CF patients
  is to suppress the allergy related symptoms by administration of glucocorticoids,
  itraconazole (ITRA), administered orally at high doses, can alleviate the symptoms
  of ABPA. However, no inhalable formulation of ITRA is available to enable local
  treatment of aspergillosis. The aim of this study was to describe an aqueous nanosuspension
  of ITRA and to characterize the pharmacokinetics after single dose inhalation. Using
  wet-milling with organic milling beads, a stable nanosuspension with particle size
  in the range of 200nm and an ITRA concentration of 20% (v/w) could be obtained,
  using polysorbate 80 at a concentration of 14% relative to ITRA. The suspension
  was stable if stored at 8 C for 3 months without particle growth and could be nebulized
  using standard nebulizer technologies including mesh technology and pressured air
  nebulizers. A 10% suspension was well tolerated upon repeated dose inhalation once
  daily for 7 days at a predicted dose of 45mg/kg in rats. A single dose inhalation
  at a predicted dose of 22.5mg/kg resulted in maximum lung tissue concentration of
  21.4mug/g tissue with a terminal half-life of 25.4h. Serum concentrations were lower,
  with a maximum concentration of 104ng/ml at 4h after dosing and a terminal half-life
  of 10.5h. The data indicate that ITRA nanosuspension represents an interesting formulation
  for inhaled administration in CF patients suffering from ABPA. High and long lasting
  lung tissue concentrations well above the minimal inhibitory concentration of Aspergillus
  species enable once daily administration with minimal systemic exposure.
