input_text: 'Mannitol delivery by vibrating mesh nebulisation for enhancing mucociliary
  clearance.Mucociliary clearance is compromised by airway surface liquid dehydration
  in respiratory disease states such as cystic fibrosis. Rehydration by hyperosmolar
  agents such as nebulised hypertonic saline and dry powder mannitol has demonstrated
  in vivo safety and efficacy for restoring mucociliary function. Mannitol, delivered
  as a nebulised formulation for this purpose, has not been investigated as yet. The
  current study examines the feasibility of delivering such a formulation using recent
  vibrating mesh technology. Nebulisation was conducted using an Aeroneb Go(TM) vibrating
  mesh nebuliser, and aerosol size was assessed by laser diffraction. Cascade impaction
  coupled with mass assay by high-performance liquid chromatography was used to confirm
  fluid uniformity and correlation with laser diffraction sizing. The following nebuliser
  formulations were prepared and aerosolised: deionised water, mannitol (150 mg/mL)
  aqueous solution, sodium chloride aqueous solution [0.2%, 1%, 3%, 5%, 7% (w/v)]
  and mannitol (150 mg/mL) in sodium chloride solution [0.2%, 1%, 3%, 7% (w/v)]. Mannitol
  aqueous solution was poorly nebulised, resulting in lengthy treatment times and
  large median droplet size. Addition of sodium chloride drastically improved nebuliser
  performance and aerosol characteristics. In vivo studies are necessary to confirm
  efficacy of nebulised mannitol. If substantiated, it could provide a pleasant-tasting
  alternative mucoactive agent with prolonged therapeutic action.'
