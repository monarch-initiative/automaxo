input_text: 'Aerosol delivery of DNA/liposomes to the lung for cystic fibrosis gene
  therapy.Abstract Lung gene therapy is being evaluated for a range of acute and chronic
  diseases, including cystic fibrosis (CF). As these therapies approach clinical realization,
  it is becoming increasingly clear that the ability to efficiently deliver gene transfer
  agents (GTAs) to target cell populations within the lung may prove just as critical
  as the gene therapy formulation itself in terms of generating positive clinical
  outcomes. Key to the success of any aerosol gene therapy is the interaction between
  the GTA and nebulization device. We evaluated the effects of aerosolization on our
  preferred formulation, plasmid DNA (pDNA) complexed with the cationic liposome GL67A
  (pDNA/GL67A) using commercially available nebulizer devices. The relatively high
  viscosity (6.3+-0.1 cP) and particulate nature of pDNA/GL67A formulations hindered
  stable aerosol generation in ultrasonic and vibrating mesh nebulizers but was not
  problematic in the jet nebulizers tested. Aerosol size characteristics varied significantly
  between devices, but the AeroEclipse II nebulizer operating at 50 psi generated
  stable pDNA/GL67A aerosols suitable for delivery to the CF lung (mass median aerodynamic
  diameter 3.4+-0.1 mum). Importantly, biological function of pDNA/GL67A formulations
  was retained after nebulization, and although aerosol delivery rate was lower than
  that of other devices (0.17+-0.01 ml/min), the breath-actuated AeroEclipse II nebulizer
  generated aerosol only during the inspiratory phase and as such was more efficient
  than other devices with 83+-3% of generated aerosol available for patient inhalation.
  On the basis of these results, we have selected the AeroEclipse II nebulizer for
  the delivery of pDNA/GL67A formulations to the lungs of CF patients as part of phase
  IIa/b clinical studies. '
