input_text: 'Comparison of amikacin lung delivery between AKITA  and eFlow rapid  nebulizers
  in healthy controls and patients with CF: A randomized cross-over trial.INTRODUCTION:
  Nebulization plays a key role in the treatment of cystic fibrosis. The Favorite
  function couple to jet nebulizers (AKITA ) emerged recently. The aim of this study
  was to assess the efficiency of the lung delivery by the AKITA  by comparing the
  urinary concentration of amikacin after nebulization with the AKITA  and the eFlow
  rapid , in healthy subjects and patients with CF (PwCF). METHOD: The two samples
  (healthy subjects and PwCF) were randomized (cross-over 1:1) for two nebulizations
  (500 mg of amikacin diluted in 4 mL of normal saline solution), with the AKITA  and
  with the eFlow rapid . The primary endpoint was the amount of urinary excretion
  of amikacin over 24 h. The constant of elimination (Ke) was calculated based on
  the maximal cumulative urinary amikacin excretion plotted over time. RESULTS: The
  total amount of urinary amikacin excretion was greater when AKITA  was used in PwCF
  (11.7 mg (8.2-14.1) vs 6.1 mg (3.7-13.3); p = 0.02) but not different in healthy
  subjects (14.5 mg (11.7-18.5) vs 12.4 mg (8.0-17.1); p = 0.12). The duration of
  the nebulization was always shorter with eFlow rapid  than with AKITA  (PwCF: 6.5
  +- 0.6 min vs 9.2 +- 1.8 min; p = 0.001 - Healthy: 4.7 +- 1.3 min vs 9.7 +- 1.6
  min; p = 0.03). The constant of elimination was similar between the two modalities
  in CF subjects (0.153 (0.071-0.205) vs 0.149 (0.041-0.182); p = 0.26) and in healthy
  subjects (0.166 (0.130-0.218) vs 0.167 (0.119-0.210), p = 0.25). CONCLUSION: the
  Favorite inhalation is better to deliver a specific amount of drug than a mesh nebulizer
  (eFlow rapid ) in PwCF but not in healthy subjects.'
