input_text: '[Vitamin D and pediatrics respiratory diseases].The better understanding
  of the global activity of vitamin D has led to an intense search for its involvement
  in non-skeletal diseases. This article presents an updated review of the relationship
  between vitamin D and pediatric respiratory pathology. A literature search was performed
  in PUBMED using free terms and MESH terms: vitamin D, asthma, respiratory system
  diseases, and bronchiolitis. Stu dies in human patients younger than 18 years and
  animals, published in English and Spanish until 2017 were included. 507 articles
  were found, of which 43 were included. Indirect evidence suggests a role of vitamin
  D and fetal lung maturation. In relation to pediatric pulmonary pathology, studies
  are scarce and inconclusive. Recent meta-analyses performed with individualized
  evaluation of the participants shows an important protective role of vitamin D supplementation
  in the prevention of severe asthma exacerbations and acute viral infections. In
  bronchiolitis, the results are contradictory, with no clear relationship between
  plasma levels and severity. There is not enough evidence to assess the benefits
  of vitamin D supplementation in cystic fibrosis and tuberculosis. A direct relationship
  between the severity of sleep-related breathing disorders and vitamin D plasma levels
  has recently been proposed, although the exact mechanisms involved in this association
  are unknown. Current information suggests that vitamin D supplementation may represent
  a cost-effective strategy in redu cing important causes of infant morbidity and
  mortality.'
