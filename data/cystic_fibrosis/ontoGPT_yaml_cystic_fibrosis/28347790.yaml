input_text: "Key considerations on nebulization of antimicrobial agents to mechanically
  ventilated patients.Nebulized antibiotics have an established role in patients with
  cystic fibrosis or bronchiectasis. Their potential benefit to treat respiratory
  infections in mechanically ventilated patients is receiving increasing interest.
  In this consensus statement of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and
  Infectious Diseases, the body of evidence of the therapeutic utility of aerosolized
  antibiotics in mechanically ventilated patients was reviewed and resulted in the
  following recommendations: Vibrating-mesh nebulizers should be preferred to jet
  or ultrasonic nebulizers. To decrease turbulence and limit circuit and tracheobronchial
  deposition, we recommend: (a) the use of specifically designed respiratory circuits
  avoiding sharp angles and characterized by smooth inner surfaces, (b) the use of
  specific ventilator settings during nebulization including use of a volume controlled
  mode using constant inspiratory flow, tidal volume 8 mL/kg, respiratory frequency
  12 to 15 bpm, inspiratory:expiratory ratio 50%, inspiratory pause 20% and positive
  end-expiratory pressure 5 to 10 cm H2O and (c) the administration of a short-acting
  sedative agent if coordination between the patient and the ventilator is not obtained,
  to avoid patient's flow triggering and episodes of peak decelerating inspiratory
  flow. A filter should be inserted on the expiratory limb to protect the ventilator
  flow device and changed between each nebulization to avoid expiratory flow obstruction.
  A heat and moisture exchanger and/or conventional heated humidifier should be stopped
  during the nebulization period to avoid a massive loss of aerosolized particles
  through trapping and condensation. If these technical requirements are not followed,
  there is a high risk of treatment failure and adverse events in mechanically ventilated
  patients receiving nebulized antibiotics for pneumonia."
