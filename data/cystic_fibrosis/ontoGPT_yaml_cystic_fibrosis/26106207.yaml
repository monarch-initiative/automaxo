input_text: 'Radioaerosol Pulmonary Deposition Using Mesh and Jet Nebulizers During
  Noninvasive Ventilation in Healthy Subjects.BACKGROUND: In vivo deposition studies
  of aerosol administration during noninvasive ventilation (NIV) are scarce in the
  literature. The aim of this study was to compare radioaerosol pulmonary index and
  radioaerosol mass balance in the different compartments (pulmonary and extrapulmonary)
  of radio-tagged aerosol administered using vibrating mesh nebulizers and conventional
  jet nebulizers during NIV. METHODS: This was a crossover clinical trial involving
  10 healthy subjects (mean age of 33.7 +- 10.0 y) randomly assigned to both treatment
  arms of this study: group 1 (NIV + vibrating mesh nebulizer, n = 10) and group 2
  (NIV + jet nebulizer, n = 10). All subjects inhaled 3 mL of technetium-99m diethylenetriaminepentaacetic
  acid (25 mCi) and 0.9% saline solution via vibrating mesh and jet nebulizers during
  NIV through a face mask secured with straps while receiving positive inspiratory
  and expiratory pressures of 12 and 5 cm H2O, respectively. Scintigraphy was performed
  to count radioaerosol particles deposited in the regions of interest to determine
  radioaerosol mass balance from the lungs, upper airways, stomach, nebulizer, ventilator
  circuit, inspiratory and expiratory filters, and mask as a percentage. RESULTS:
  Vibrating mesh nebulizers deposited 972,013 +- 214,459 counts versus jet nebulizer
  with 386,025 +- 130,363 counts (P = .005). In a determination of mass balance, vibrating
  mesh nebulizers showed a higher deposition of inhaled radioaerosol compared with
  jet nebulizers (23.1 +- 5.8% vs 6.1 +- 2.5%, P = .005) and a higher proportion of
  radioaerosol deposited into the lungs (5.5 +- 0.9% versus 1.5 +- 0.6%, respectively,
  P = .005). The residual drug volume was lower with vibrating mesh nebulizers (5.1
  +- 1.5%) compared with jet nebulizers (41.3 +- 4.2%, P = .005). CONCLUSIONS: During
  NIV in healthy subjects, vibrating mesh nebulizers delivered > 2-fold more radiolabeled
  drug into the respiratory tract compared with conventional jet nebulizers. Additional
  studies are recommended in subjects with asthma, COPD, bronchiectasis, and cystic
  fibrosis to better understand differences in both aerosol delivery and response.
