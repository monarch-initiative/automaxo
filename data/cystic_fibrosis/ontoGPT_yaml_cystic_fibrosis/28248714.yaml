  Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.BACKGROUND: Nebulization of antiinfective
  agents is a common but unstandardized practice in critically ill patients. METHODS:
  A systematic review of 1,435 studies was performed in adults receiving invasive
  mechanical ventilation. Two different administration strategies (adjunctive and
  substitute) were considered clinically relevant. Inclusion was restricted to studies
  using jet, ultrasonic, and vibrating-mesh nebulizers. Studies involving children,
  colonized-but-not-infected adults, and cystic fibrosis patients were excluded. RESULTS:
  Five of the 11 studies included had a small sample size (fewer than 50 patients),
  and only 6 were randomized. Diversity of case-mix, dosage, and devices are sources
  of bias. Only a few patients had severe hypoxemia. Aminoglycosides and colistin
  were the most common antibiotics, being safe regarding nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity,
  but increased respiratory complications in 9% (95% CI, 0.01 to 0.18; I = 52%), particularly
  when administered to hypoxemic patients. For tracheobronchitis, a significant decrease
  in emergence of resistance was evidenced (risk ratio, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.64;
  I = 0%). Similar findings were observed in pneumonia by susceptible pathogens, without
  improvement in mortality or ventilation duration. In pneumonia caused by resistant
  pathogens, higher clinical resolution (odds ratio, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.30 to 2.96; I
  = 0%) was evidenced. These findings were not consistently evidenced in the assessment
  of efficacy against pneumonia caused by susceptible pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: Performance
  of randomized trials evaluating the impact of nebulized antibiotics with more homogeneous
  populations, standardized drug delivery, predetermined clinical efficacy, and safety
  outcomes is urgently required. Infections by resistant pathogens might potentially
  have higher benefit from nebulized antiinfective agents. Nebulization, without concomitant
  systemic administration of the drug, may reduce nephrotoxicity but may also be associated
  with higher risk of respiratory complications.'
