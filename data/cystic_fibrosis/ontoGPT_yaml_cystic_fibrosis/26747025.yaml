input_text: 'In vitro aerodynamic characterization of the dose emitted during nebulization
  of tobramycin high strength solution by novel and jet nebulizer delivery systems.BACKGROUND:
  Chronic infections with Pseudomonas aeruginosa are a leading cause of morbidity
  in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). The aim of tobramycin inhalation therapy
  in CF patients with chronic pulmonary infection is to deliver high amounts of drug
  directly to the site of infection. TOBI( ) is a tobramycin nebulizer solution (300
  mg/5 ml) approved by FDA for maintenance therapy for patient with CF. The 20% tobramycin
  sulfate solution was reported as the optimal and maximal concentration. METHODS:
  Nebulization of high strength tobramycin solution (20% tobramycin sulfate) (HSTS)
  has been assessed in this study by using different selected high performance nebulizer
  delivery systems: two different designs of jet nebulizers, and three new nebulizers
  based on vibrating mesh technology. The aerosol particle size distribution and output
  characteristics were measured for in vitro performance assessment of the nebulizer
  systems. The methodology was adapted from the current European standard, EN 13544-1:2001E.
  RESULTS: The particle size distribution characteristic measurements showed that
  all tested nebulizers may be suitable for inhalation of HSTS. The mean (SD) of highest
  percentage of fine particles (<5 mum) was 77.64 (2.3) % for Sidestream( ), at flow
  rate 16 L/min. The highest respirable inhaled mass was for Pari LC Plus( ) combined
  with PariBoyN( ) compressor, with mean (SD) 90.85 (8.6) mg. The mean (SD) of highest
  drug wastage percentage was 63.9 (3.9) % for Sidestream( ) jet nebulizer combined
  with compressed air cylinder at flow rate 16 L/min, while the lowest was 2.3 (0.26)
  % for NE-U22 Omron( ) (high frequency). CONCLUSIONS: The HSTS can be nebulized by
  all tested nebulisers but the high frequency NE-U22 Omron( ) and Aeroneb Go( ) are
  more efficient. When the HSTS compared to TOBI( ), the respirable inhaled dose was
  increased to more than 73%.'
