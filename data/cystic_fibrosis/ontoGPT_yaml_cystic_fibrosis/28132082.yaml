input_text: 'High tacrolimus blood concentrations early after lung transplantation
  and the risk of kidney injury.PURPOSE: Lung transplant recipients often develop
  acute kidney injury (AKI) evolving into chronic kidney disease (CKD). The immunosuppressant
  tacrolimus might be associated with the emergence of AKI. We analyzed the development
  and recovery of kidney injury after lung transplantation and related AKI to whole-blood
  tacrolimus trough concentrations and other factors causing kidney injury. METHODS:
  We retrospectively studied kidney injury in 186 lung-transplantation patients at
  the UMC Utrecht between 2001 and 2011. Kidney function and whole-blood tacrolimus
  trough concentrations were determined from day 1 to 14 and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months
  postoperative. Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), septic shock, and
  nephrotoxic medications were evaluated as covariates for AKI. We analyzed liver
  injury and drug-drug interactions. RESULTS: AKI was present in 85 (46%) patients.
  Tacrolimus concentrations were supra-therapeutic in 135 of 186 patients (73%). AKI
  in the first week after transplantation was related to supra-therapeutic tacrolimus
  concentrations (OR 1.55; 95% CI 1.06-2.27), >=3 other nephrotoxic drugs (OR 1.96;
  95% CI 1.02-3.77), infection (OR 2.48; 95% CI 1.31-4.70), and cystic fibrosis (OR
  2.17; 95% CI 1.16-4.06). Recovery rate of AKI was lower than expected (19%), and
  the cumulative incidence of severe CKD at 1 year was 15%. CONCLUSIONS: After lung
  transplantation, AKI is common and often evolves into severe CKD, which is a known
  cause of morbidity and mortality. Supra-therapeutic whole-blood tacrolimus trough
  concentrations are related to the early onset of AKI. Conscientious targeting tacrolimus
  blood concentrations might be vital in the early phase after lung transplantation.
  What is known about this subject?   Lung transplant recipients often develop acute
  kidney injury evolving into chronic kidney disease increasing both morbidity and
  mortality.   To date, the pathophysiology of kidney injury after lung transplantation
  has not been fully elucidated.   The immunosuppressant tacrolimus is difficult to
  dose, especially in the unstable clinical setting, and is nephrotoxic. WHAT THIS
  STUDY ADDS:   For the first time, supra-therapeutic whole-blood tacrolimus trough
  concentrations are related to the emergence of acute kidney injury in the first
  days after lung transplantation.   Supra-therapeutic whole-blood tacrolimus trough
  concentrations often occur early after lung transplantation.   AKI after lung transplantation
  shows low recovery rates.'
