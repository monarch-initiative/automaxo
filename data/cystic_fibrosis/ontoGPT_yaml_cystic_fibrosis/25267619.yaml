input_text: 'Probing biological nanotopology via diffusion of weakly constrained plasmonic
  nanorods with optical coherence tomography.Biological materials exhibit complex
  nanotopology, i.e., a composite liquid and solid phase structure that is heterogeneous
  on the nanoscale. The diffusion of nanoparticles in nanotopological environments
  can elucidate biophysical changes associated with pathogenesis and disease progression.
  However, there is a lack of methods that characterize nanoprobe diffusion and translate
  easily to in vivo studies. Here, we demonstrate a method based on optical coherence
  tomography (OCT) to depth-resolve diffusion of plasmon-resonant gold nanorods (GNRs)
  that are weakly constrained by the biological tissue. By using GNRs that are on
  the size scale of the polymeric mesh, their Brownian motion is minimally hindered
  by intermittent collisions with local macromolecules. OCT depth-resolves the particle-averaged
  translational diffusion coefficient (DT) of GNRs within each coherence volume, which
  is separable from the nonequilibrium motile activities of cells based on the unique
  polarized light-scattering properties of GNRs. We show how this enables minimally
  invasive imaging and monitoring of nanotopological changes in a variety of biological
  models, including extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling as relevant to carcinogenesis,
  and dehydration of pulmonary mucus as relevant to cystic fibrosis. In 3D ECM models,
  DT of GNRs decreases with both increasing collagen concentration and cell density.
  Similarly, DT of GNRs is sensitive to human bronchial-epithelial mucus concentration
  over a physiologically relevant range. This novel method comprises a broad-based
  platform for studying heterogeneous nanotopology, as distinct from bulk viscoelasticity,
  in biological milieu. '
