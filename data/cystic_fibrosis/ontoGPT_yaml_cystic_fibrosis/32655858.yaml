input_text: Nitric oxide diffusion through cystic fibrosis-relevant media and lung
  tissue.A simplified diffusion cell methodology was employed to measure the diffusion
  coefficient of nitric oxide (NO) through phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and artificial
  sputum medium (ASM)-an in vitro analog for airway mucus. Diffusion through the proteinaceous
  ASM yielded a significantly lower diffusion coefficient compared to PBS, which is
  attributed to both the physical obstruction by the mucin mesh and reactive nature
  of NO radicals towards the biological compounds in ASM. To further confirm that
  ASM was restricting NO from diffusing freely, a macromolecular propylamine-modified
  cyclodextrin donor (CD-PA) was employed to release the NO more slowly. The NO diffusion
  characteristics in ASM via the NO donor were also slower relative to PBS. As NO
  is likely to interact with lung cells after passing through the mucus barrier, the
  diffusion of both NO and the CD-PA macromolecular NO donor through differentiated
  lung tissue was investigated with and without an ASM layer. Comparison of NO diffusion
  through the three diffusion barriers indicated that the lung tissue significantly
  impeded NO penetration over the course of the experiment compared to PBS and ASM.
  In fact, the diffusion of CD-PA through the lung tissue was hindered until after
  the release of its NO payload, potentially due to the increased net charge of the
  NO donor structure. Of importance, the viability of the tissue was not influenced
  by the NO-releasing CD-PA at bactericidal concentrations.
