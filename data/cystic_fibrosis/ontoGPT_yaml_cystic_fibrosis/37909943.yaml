input_text: '[Pediatric pulmonary rehabilitation in the light of qualitative research:
  What statistic cannot show].Several studies have supported the positive effect of
  respiratory rehabilitation (RR) in children and adolescents (CRA) with chronic respiratory
  diseases (CRD); however, qualitative aspects related to the experiences and perceptions
  about RR have been scarcely studied. OBJECTIVE: to analyze the qualitative evidence
  regarding the perceptions and experiences of patients, families and professionals
  related to the RR of children and adolescents with CKD. METHODS: Review of qualitative
  studies in 5 databases. We used MeSH terms and free English-language terms grouped
  into three dimensions: patients, intervention, and research design. The study subjects
  had to be patients, their families, teachers or treating health teams. No restrictions
  were placed on language or year of publication. The search strategy was configured
  as follows: ((Cystic fibrosis) OR (Asthma) OR (Neuromuscular diseases)) AND ((Respiratory
  rehabilitation) OR (Exercise)) AND ((Qualitative research) OR (Phenomenology) OR
  (Grounded theory) OR (Ethnography)). Two independent authors analyzed atingent titles,
  abstracts and long texts. Finally, a qualitative description of the results was
  made. RESULTS: Twenty-one qualitative studies were selected, all on patients, family
  members, teachers or professionals treating patients with cystic fibrosis (CF),
  asthma or neuromuscular diseases (NMD). Perception of benefits, parental influence,
  enjoyment of the protocols, and time required to engage in physical activity were
  categories identified in all three groups. Aspects such as perceived safety on school
  grounds and parental stress were specific categories, highlighted in the context
  of asthma and CF respectively. CONCLUSION: Several general and specific factors
  of a qualitative nature influence the experience of children with CRD during RR.
  Future studies conducted in our cultural context should be conducted to confirm
  these results.'
