input_text: 'Hyaluronic acid for the treatment of airway diseases in children: Little
  evidence for few indications.BACKGROUND: Hyaluronic acid (HA) is major physiological
  component of the extracellular matrix, which, in its high molecular weight form
  (HMW-HA) has anti-inflammatory properties. The diffusion of many different medical
  devices for inhalation therapy containing HA has led to an increase in their prescription,
  also in children. Here, we systematically review the published evidence on the efficacy
  and safety of HA for the treatment of upper and lower airway diseases in childhood.
  METHODS: Relevant published studies (randomized controlled trials) for the efficacy
  of HA inhalation in children with upper airways diseases, asthma, cystic fibrosis
  (CF), and non-CF bronchiectasis were searched in Pubmed, Scopus, and Web of Knowledge
  databases by combining the adequate Medical Subject Headings terms and keywords,
  with no limit for the year of publication. RESULTS: We identified seven relevant
  publications for upper airways diseases, one for asthma, and five for CF, while
  we found no clinical trial including children with non-CF bronchiectasis. Meta-analysis
  was not conducted due to the heterogeneity of the included studies. CONCLUSIONS:
  The evidence of HA efficacy in the treatment of the upper and lower airways is still
  limited in children. Available data suggest that inhaled HMW-HA could be useful
  in the treatment of recurrent upper respiratory infections and chronic or recurrent
  inflammation of the middle ear and adenoids as well as of the lower airways in cystic
  fibrosis in association with hypertonic saline solution. Studies on larger populations
  and on the different formulations and nebulization methods, especially in pediatric
  age, are urgently needed.'
