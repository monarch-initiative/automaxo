input_text: Synergy of nebulized phage PEV20 and ciprofloxacin combination against
  Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Nebulization is currently used for delivery of antibiotics
  for respiratory infections. Bacteriophages (or phages) are effective predators of
  pathogens including Pseudomonas aeruginosa commonly found in the lungs of patients
  with cystic fibrosis (CF). It is known that phages and antibiotics can potentially
  show synergistic antimicrobial effect on bacterial killing. In the present study,
  we investigated synergistic antimicrobial effect of phage PEV20 with five different
  antibiotics against three P. aeruginosa strains isolated from sputum of CF patients.
  The antibiotics included ciprofloxacin, tobramycin, colistin, aztreonam and amikacin,
  which are approved by U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for inhaled administration.
  Phage and antibiotic synergy was determined by assessing bacterial killing performing
  time-kill studies. Among the different phage-antibiotic combinations, PEV20 and
  ciprofloxacin exhibited the most synergistic effect. Two phage-ciprofloxacin combinations,
  containing 1/4 and 1/2 of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ciprofloxacin
  against P. aeruginosa strains FADD1-PA001 (A) and JIP865, respectively were aerosolized
  using both air-jet and vibrating mesh nebulizers and the synergistic antibacterial
  activity was maintained after nebulization. Air-jet nebulizer generated droplets
  with smaller volume median diameters (3.6-3.7 microm) and slightly larger span (2.3-2.4)
  than vibrating mesh nebulizers (5.1-5.3 microm; 2.1-2.2), achieving a higher fine
  particle fraction (FPF) of 70%. In conclusion, nebulized phage PEV20 and ciprofloxacin
  combination shows promising antimicrobial and aerosol characteristics for potential
  treatment of respiratory tract infections caused by drug-resistant P. aeruginosa.
