input_text: "Psychological impact of working with patients with cystic fibrosis at
  end-of-life, pre-transplant stage.OBJECTIVE: Multidisciplinary staff who work with
  end-of-life, pre-transplant patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) have to juggle two
  seemingly opposing care approaches; active care to maintain their patients' health
  and condition in anticipation of a transplant, and sensitive palliative care that
  takes their end-of-life wishes into consideration should they not receive a transplant.
  Little is known about the psychological impact on staff working within this care
  dichotomy. The aim of this study is to explore staff's experiences and understand
  more about the psychological impact of this work on them professionally and personally,
  and how this affects their ability to provide appropriate care for their patients.
  METHOD: A qualitative explorative research design was used. Ten semistructured interviews
  with multidisciplinary staff working in cystic fibrosis centers and units across
  the United Kingdom were analyzed using interpretative phenomenological analysis
  (IPA). RESULTS: Two superordinate themes emerged from the analysis: factors contributing
  to the \"juggle\" of active and palliative care, and extent of emotional impact
  on staff. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: The study indicates that there is an emotional
  impact on staff working with patients with CF at end-of-life, pre-transplant stages.
  Specifically, it reveals the extent of the unpredictability that staff work with,
  and the range of emotions that staff experience, including uncertainty about professional
  identity and anxiety about working practices. The depth and intimacy of professional-patient
  relationships is highlighted, particularly for staff in close contact with and similar
  in age to their patients. Additionally, the strength of staff's commitment and desire
  to care for patients within broader humanistic terms that mesh with their own personal
  values is brought to light. Despite the difficulties with their work, the majority
  of staff adopted numerous coping strategies to manage their emotions, many of which
  emphasized the link between their professional and personal values in undertaking
  their roles."
