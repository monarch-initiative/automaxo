input_text: Can Targeting Iron Help in Combating Chronic Pseudomonas Infection? A
  Systematic Review.Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a
  mutation in genes for cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)
  protein. CFTR gene is responsible for the production of sweat, digestive fluids,
  and mucus, and any mutation in this would lead to the thickening of these secretions.
  Cystic fibrosis is a multi-organ disorder, but 80% of patients suffer from respiratory
  problems due to chronic infections most commonly caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa
  (P. aeruginosa). Eradication of these infections has become a challenge as P. aeruginosa
  has developed resistance to multiple antibiotics. In several studies, iron has been
  shown to play an integral role in biofilm formation, which is the predominant resistance
  mechanism used by P. aeruginosa to combat antibiotics. The increased iron content
  in cystic fibrosis patients' sputum samples explains their increased susceptibility
  to Pseudomonas infections. Hence in this review article, we have used the research
  data available on therapeutic agents that target iron as an adjuvant treatment for
  chronic Pseudomonas infection. We systematically screened three databases using
  focused words and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms for relevant articles. Further,
  we applied the inclusion and exclusion criteria and performed a thorough quality
  appraisal. Thirty shortlisted relevant studies were meticulously reviewed. In our
  opinion, novel therapeutic approaches targeting iron such as iron chelators, gallium,
  and cefiderocol have potent anti-biofilm properties. Future studies and clinical
  trials using these approaches in the management of chronic Pseudomonas infection
  might help in decreasing morbidity and mortality in patients with cystic fibrosis.
  Exploring these approaches might also help to combat other resistant organisms whose
  survival is dependent on iron.
