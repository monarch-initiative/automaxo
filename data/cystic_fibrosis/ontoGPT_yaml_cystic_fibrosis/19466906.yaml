input_text: 'Changes in performance of the Pari eFlow rapid and Pari LC Plus during
  6 months use by CF patients.BACKGROUND: Nebulized antibiotics are important in the
  treatment of cystic fibrosis. The Pari eFlow rapid with vibrating mesh is often
  used off-label for the administration of tobramycin (TOBI) because of a reduced
  nebulization time and easier handling compared to a classic nebulizer-compressor
  combination. Mesh technology may be vulnerable, however. Therefore, we investigated
  particle size distribution and output as well as changes in the performance of the
  eFlow before and after 6 months of use, in comparison with the Pari LC Plus nebulizer
  plus Turboboy compressor. METHODS: Size distributions in the aerosols and nebulization
  times for TOBI were measured with laser diffraction technique; delivered doses by
  weighing. RESULTS: New eFlows produce considerably larger droplets (X(50) = 3.5
  mum) from TOBI than new LC Plus nebulizers (X(50) = 2.8 mum). After use, the X(50)
  increases for both systems (to 3.7 and 3.3 mum, respectively). The relative span
  of the size distribution {(X(90)-X(10))/X(50)} changes from 1.26 to 1.28 mum for
  eFlow and from 2.19 to 2.45 mum for LC Plus. The total nebulization time doubles
  for LC Plus, whereas in 51% of all experiments the eFlow switched off after 10 min,
  resulting in incomplete dose delivery. For the eFlow, changes during use are related
  to clogging of orifices. Once being clogged, only replacement of the mesh restores
  the original performance. CONCLUSIONS: New eFlows produce larger droplets and in
  a narrower size range compared to new LC Plus nebulizers for TOBI, and therefore
  both devices are not equivalent. Theoretically a larger portion of the aerosol from
  eFlow is likely to be deposited in the upper airways. The performance of both tested
  nebulizers decreases after 6 months of use. For the eFlow, timely replacement of
  the mesh is necessary. These in vitro results underscore the importance of registration
  studies of new drug-device combinations.'
