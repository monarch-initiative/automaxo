input_text: 'Structurally variant classes of pilus appendage fibers coexpressed from
  Burkholderia (Pseudomonas) cepacia.One or more of five morphologically distinct
  classes of appendage pili were determined to be peritrichously expressed by Burkholderia
  (formerly Pseudomonas) cepacia isolated from disparate sources. B. cepacia-encoded
  cblA pilin gene hybridization-based analysis revealed that one associated class,
  cable (Cbl) adhesin type IIB. cepacia pili, correlates with epidemically transmitted
  strains from a single cystic fibrosis (CF) center. When only phenotypic assays were
  available, correlations between the source and the pilus type were nonetheless observed:
  filamentous (Fil) type IIIB. cepacia pili correlated with CF-associated nonepidemic
  isolates, spine (Spn) type IVB. cepacia pili correlated with clinical (non-CF) isolates,
  and spike (Spk) type VB. cepacia pili correlated with environmental isolates. Further,
  Cbl, Fil, or Spk pili typically appear as an internal framework for constitutively
  coexpressed, peritrichously arranged dense mats of fine, curly mesh (Msh) type IB.
  cepacia pili. Constitutive coexpression of dense mats of Msh type IB. cepacia pili
  in association with a labyrinth of either Cbl, Fil, or Spk pili suggests possible
  cooperative pilus interactions mediating adhesion-based colonization in the differing
  environments from which the strains were isolated. Despite such correlations, phylogenetic
  analyses indicate that with the exception of the epidemically transmitted clusters
  of isolates, the remaining B. cepacia strains from the other three sources exhibited
  an equal degree of genetic relatedness independent of origin. As previously found
  for Escherichia coli, this discrepancy could be accounted for by selection-driven,
  in vivo horizontal transfer events between distantly related members of the species
  B. cepacia, leading to the genetic acquisition of environmentally appropriate adhesion-based
  colonization pilus operons.'
