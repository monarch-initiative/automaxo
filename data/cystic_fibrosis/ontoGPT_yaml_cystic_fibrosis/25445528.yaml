input_text: Sodium colistimethate loaded lipid nanocarriers for the treatment of Pseudomonas
  aeruginosa infections associated with cystic fibrosis.Lung impairment is the most
  life-threatening factor for cystic fibrosis patients. Indeed, Pseudomonas aeruginosa
  is the main pathogen in the pulmonary infection of these patients. In this work,
  we developed sodium colistimethate loaded lipid nanoparticles, namely, solid lipid
  nanoparticles (SLN) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC), as a strategy to enhance
  the antimicrobial therapy against P. aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis patients. The
  nanoparticles obtained displayed a 200-400 nm size, high drug entrapment (79-94%)
  and a sustained drug release profile. Moreover, both SLN and NLC presented antimicrobial
  activity against clinically isolated P. aeruginosa. The integrity of the nanoparticles
  was not affected by nebulization through a mesh vibrating nebulizer. Moreover, lipid
  nanoparticles appeared to be less toxic than free sodium colistimethate in cell
  culture. Finally, an in vivo distribution experiment showed that nanoparticles spread
  homogenously through the lung and there was no migration of lipid nanoparticles
  to other organs, such as liver, spleen or kidneys.
