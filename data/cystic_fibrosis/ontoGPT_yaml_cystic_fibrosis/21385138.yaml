input_text: 'Rapid transport of muco-inert nanoparticles in cystic fibrosis sputum
  treated with N-acetyl cysteine.AIMS: Sputum poses a critical diffusional barrier
  that strongly limits the efficacy of drug and gene carriers in the airways of individuals
  with cystic fibrosis (CF). Previous attempts to enhance particle penetration of
  CF sputum have focused on either reducing its barrier properties via mucolytics,
  or decreasing particle adhesion to sputum constituents by coating the particle surface
  with non-mucoadhesive polymers, including polyethylene glycol (PEG). Neither approach
  has enabled particles to penetrate expectorated sputum at rates previously observed
  for non-mucoadhesive nanoparticles in human cervicovaginal mucus. Here, we sought
  to investigate whether a common mucolytic, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), in combination
  with dense PEG coatings on particles, can synergistically enhance particle penetration
  across fresh undiluted CF sputum. MATERIALS & METHODS: We used high-resolution multiple
  particle tracking to measure the diffusion of uncoated and PEG-coated nanoparticles
  in native and NAC-treated CF sputum. RESULTS: We discovered that 200 nm particles,
  if densely coated with PEG, were able to penetrate CF sputum pretreated with NAC
  with average speeds approaching their theoretical speeds in water. Based on the
  rapid penetration of PEG-coated particles in NAC-treated sputum, we determined that
  the average spacing between sputum mesh elements was increased from 145 +- 50 nm
  to 230 +- 50 nm upon NAC treatment. Mathematical models based on particle transport
  rates suggest as much as 75 and 30% of 200 and 500 nm PEG-coated particles, respectively,
  may penetrate a physiologically thick NAC-treated CF sputum layer within 20 min.
  Uncoated particles were trapped in CF sputum pretreated with NAC nearly to the same
  extent as in native sputum, suggesting that NAC treatment alone offered little improvement
  to particle penetration. CONCLUSION: NAC facilitated rapid diffusion of PEG-coated,
  muco-inert nanoparticles in CF sputum. Our results provide a promising strategy
  to improve drug and gene carrier penetration in CF sputum, offering hope for improved
  therapies for CF.'
