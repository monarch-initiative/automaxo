input_text: 'Exopolysaccharide production in biofilms: substratum activation of alginate
  gene expression by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Reporter gene technology was employed
  to detect the activity of an alginate promoter of Pseudomonas aeruginosa when the
  organism was grown as a biofilm on a Teflon mesh substratum and as planktonic cells
  in liquid medium. Alginate biosynthetic activity was determined with a mucoid cell
  line derived from a cystic fibrosis isolate and containing an alginate algC promoter
  fused to a lacZ reporter gene. Reporter activity was demonstrated with chromogenic
  and fluorogenic substrates for beta-galactosidase. Expression of algC was shown
  to be upregulated in biofilm cells compared with planktonic cells in liquid medium.
  Gene up-expression correlated with alginate biosynthesis as measured by Fourier
  transform infrared spectroscopy, uronic acid accumulation, and alginate-specific
  enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The algC promoter was shown to have maximum activity
  in planktonic cultures during the late lag and early log phases of the cell growth
  cycle. During a time course experiment, biofilm algC activity exceeded planktonic
  activity except during the period immediately following inoculation into fresh medium.
  In continuous-culture experiments, conversion of lacZ substrate was demonstrated
  microscopically in individual cells by epifluorescence microscopy.'
