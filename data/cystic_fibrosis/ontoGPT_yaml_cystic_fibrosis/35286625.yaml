input_text: 'Effect of chest physiotherapy on cystic fibrosis sputum nanostructure:
  an experimental and theoretical approach.Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a disease characterized
  by the production of viscous mucoid secretions in multiple organs, particularly
  the airways. The pathological increase of proteins, mucin and biological polymers
  determines their arrangement into a three-dimensional polymeric network, affecting
  the whole mucus and impairing the muco-ciliary clearance which promotes inflammation
  and bacterial infection. Thus, to improve the efficacy of the drugs usually applied
  in CF therapy (e.g., mucolytics, anti-inflammatory and antibiotics), an in-depth
  understanding of the mucus nanostructure is of utmost importance. Drug diffusivity
  inside a gel-like system depends on the ratio between the diffusing drug molecule
  radius and the mesh size of the network. Based on our previous findings, we propose
  the combined use of rheology and low field NMR to study the mesh size distribution
  of the sputum from CF patients. Specifically, we herein explore the effects of chest
  physiotherapy on CF sputum characteristic as evaluated by rheology, low field NMR
  and the drug penetration through the mucus via mathematical simulation. These data
  show that chest physiotherapy has beneficial effects on patients, as it favourably
  modifies sputum and enhances drug penetration through the respiratory mucus.'
