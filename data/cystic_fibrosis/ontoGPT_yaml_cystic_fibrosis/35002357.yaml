input_text: 'Pulmonary Nontuberculous Mycobacterial Infection in Infants: A Systematic
  Review.Limited information and literature exist examining pulmonary infections caused
  by nontuberculous mycobacterial specifically in an infant population. The objective
  of our study was to summarize clinical characteristics and outcomes of infant patients
  with nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary infection via systematic literature
  review to identify common diagnostic and treatment regimens for this infection in
  infants. A search of MEDLINE and PubMed databases in October 2019 using MeSH search
  terms "infant," "NTM," "pulmonary," and "Mycobacterium abscessus" yielded 139 articles.
  Inclusion criteria were i) English-language studies including cases and case series
  with ii) established nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary infection in iii) a
  patient population of infants no older than 24 months. Patients with cystic fibrosis
  and any study which did not contain relevant information such as infection and age
  were excluded. This yielded data on 37 patients extracted from 28 studies analyzed.
  The most common strain was Mycobacterium avium complex, isolated in 56.8% of patient
  diagnoses. Bronchoscopy/thoracoscopy with a subsequent culture were the most common
  diagnostic techniques, utilized in 64.9% of cases. Drug therapeutic treatment was
  utilized in 86% of cases, with a median of three drugs administered. Notable limitations
  of this study are the small sample size and its retrospective nature, which relies
  on information reported in previous case studies. Although there is limited formal
  clinician consensus on the treatment of NTM pulmonary infection and how it may differ
  in an infant population, our findings indicate an informal consensus typically involving
  diagnostic lung specimen culture and antibiotic therapy.'
