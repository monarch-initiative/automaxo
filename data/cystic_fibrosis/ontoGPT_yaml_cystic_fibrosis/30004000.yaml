input_text: PEGylated enhanced cell penetrating peptide nanoparticles for lung gene
  therapy.The lung remains an attractive target for the gene therapy of monogenetic
  diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF). Despite over 27 clinical trials, there are
  still very few gene therapy vectors that have shown any improvement in lung function;
  highlighting the need to develop formulations with improved gene transfer potency
  and the desirable physiochemical characteristics for efficacious therapy. Herein,
  we introduce a novel cell penetrating peptide (CPP)-based non-viral vector that
  utilises glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-binding enhanced transduction (GET) for highly
  efficient gene transfer. GET peptides couple directly with DNA through electrostatic
  interactions to form nanoparticles (NPs). In order to adapt the GET peptide for
  efficient in vivo delivery, we engineered PEGylated versions of the peptide and
  employed a strategy to form DNA NPs with different densities of PEG coatings. We
  were able to identify candidate formulations (PEGylation rates >=40%) that shielded
  the positively charged surface of particles, maintained colloidal stability in bronchoalveolar
  lavage fluid (BALF) and retained gene transfer activity in human bronchial epithelial
  cell lines and precision cut lung slices (PCLS) in vitro. Using multiple particle
  tracking (MPT) technology, we demonstrated that PEG-GET complexes were able to navigate
  the mucus mesh and diffuse rapidly through patient CF sputum samples ex vivo. When
  tested in mouse lung models in vivo, PEGylated particles demonstrated superior biodistribution,
  improved safety profiles and efficient gene transfer of a reporter luciferase plasmid
  compared to non-PEGylated complexes. Furthermore, gene expression was significantly
  enhanced in comparison to polyethylenimine (PEI), a non-viral gene carrier that
  has been widely tested in pre-clinical settings. This work describes an innovative
  approach that combines novel GET peptides for enhanced transfection with a tuneable
  PEG coating for efficacious lung gene therapy.
