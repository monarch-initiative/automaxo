input_text: 'Inhaled Antibiotics in Non-cystic Fibrosis Bronchiectasis (NCFB): A Systematic
  Review of Efficacy and Limitations in Adult Patients.Non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis
  has recently been under the spotlight due to a better detection rate with advanced
  imaging techniques. Recurrent infections in such patients are the main cause of
  their deterioration. This invariably leads to a catastrophic wheel of decline in
  lung function, reinfection, and repeated hospital consultations. The main goal of
  their management is based on the principles of prevention and vigorous treatment
  of recurrent infections. This review aimed to gather recent therapeutic options
  for inhaled antibacterial use in such patients and compare them for their properties
  of safety and efficacy. Studies done in the last 10 years on adult patients were
  gathered using the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) strategy and later sorted using
  the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Research engines used include Google Scholar,
  PubMed, and the Saudi Digital Library. Out of the 31,739 articles identified initially,
  1362 were screened. The final eight selected papers were assessed for quality by
  using the quality assessment checklist, the Cochrane bias assessment tool, the Scale
  for the Assessment of Narrative Review Articles (SANRA) tools and cross-examined
  by co-authors. We concluded that the use of inhaled antibiotics as an adjuvant and
  follow-up treatment option is associated with better short and long-term prognoses
  in patients. They lead to lesser systemic side effects than the oral and intravenous
  varieties available on the market. However, the establishment of a hierarchy among
  the subgroups remains a grey area that needs further research.'
