  strength and body composition in adults with cystic fibrosis: Randomized controlled
  trial.INTRODUCTION: Among the limited studies on physical exercise interventions
  in adults with cystic fibrosis (CF), few have specifically addressed the improvement
  of peripheral muscle strength and body fat-free mass. The aim of this study was
  to examine the impacts of a remotely supervised, individualized 8-week resistance
  training program of moderate to high intensity on strength and body composition
  in these subjects. METHODS: This was a randomized controlled trial performed in
  adults with CF. The exercise group (EX) performed three 1-h resistance training
  sessions per week over 8 weeks. The control group (CON) followed the physical activity
  recommendations of their physician. The main outcomes were muscle strength and body
  composition, with secondary measures including pulmonary function and quality of
  life. Two-way repeated measures analysis was used. RESULTS: In 23 participants (age
  32.13 +- 7.72 years), the intervention showed a significant beneficial effect on
  leg press strength, with a large effect size, both in absolute (p = 0.011;   eta
  p 2  $$ { eta}_{ mathrm{p}}^2 $$   = 0.281) and relative (p = 0.007;   eta p 2  $$
  { eta}_{ mathrm{p}}^2 $$   = 0.310) terms. Large intervention effects were observed
  on total fat mass (p < 0.001;   eta p 2  $$ { eta}_{ mathrm{p}}^2 $$   = 0.415),
  body adiposity index (p < 0.001;   eta p 2  $$ { eta}_{ mathrm{p}}^2 $$   = 0.436),
  and fat mass index (p < 0.001;   eta p 2  $$ { eta}_{ mathrm{p}}^2 $$   = 0.445),
  all showing reduction in the EX group. In addition, significant large size effects
  were detected on total fat-free mass (p = 0.046;   eta p 2  $$ { eta}_{ mathrm{p}}^2
  $$   = 0.177), trunk fat-free mass (p = 0.039;   eta p 2  $$ { eta}_{ mathrm{p}}^2
  $$   = 0.188), and fat-free mass index (p = 0.048;   eta p 2  $$ { eta}_{ mathrm{p}}^2
  $$   = 0.174), all favoring exercise. No significant effects were observed on pulmonary
  function and quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: An 8-week remotely supervised resistance
  training program, with moderate to high intensity, effectively improved lower limb
  muscle strength and body composition.'
