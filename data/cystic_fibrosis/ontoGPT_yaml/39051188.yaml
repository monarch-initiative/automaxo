input_text: 'Cystic Fibrosis: Understanding Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Regulator
  Mutation Classification and Modulator Therapies. A common life-threatening hereditary
  disease, Cystic Fibrosis (CF), affects primarily Caucasian infants. High sweat-salt
  levels are observed as a result of a single autosomal mutation in chromosome 7 that
  affects the critical function of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR).
  For establishing tailored treatment strategies, it is important to understand the
  broad range of CFTR mutations and their impacts on disease pathophysiology. This
  study thoroughly investigates the six main classes of classification of CFTR mutations
  based on their functional effects. Each class is distinguished by distinct molecular
  flaws, such as poor protein synthesis, misfolding, gating defects, conduction defects,
  and decreased CFTR expression at the apical membrane. Furthermore, this paper focuses
  on the emerging field of CFTR modulators, which intend to restore CFTR function
  or mitigate its consequences. These modulators, which are characterized by the mode
  of action and targeted mutation class, have the potential to provide personalized
  therapy regimens in CF patients. This review provides valuable insights into the
  genetic basis of CF pathology, and highlights the potential for precision medicine
  methods in CF therapy by thoroughly investigating CFTR mutation classification and
  related modulators.'
