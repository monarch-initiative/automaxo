input_text: 'Pancreatitis in cystic fibrosis: Presentation, medical and surgical management,
  and the impact of modulator therapies. Patients with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) are at
  increased risk of acute (AP) and chronic (CP) pancreatitis, and their complications.
  The extent of remaining healthy pancreatic parenchyma determines the risk of developing
  future episodes of pancreatitis, as well as pancreatic exocrine or endocrine insufficiency.
  Pancreatitis may be the presenting symptom of CF, and genetic testing is especially
  important in pediatrics. AP and recurrent AP are managed with intravenous fluid
  hydration and pain control, in addition to early refeeding and treatment of complications.
  With the use of modulator therapy in CF, pancreatic function may be restored to
  some extent. CP related pain is managed with analgesics and neuromodulators, with
  surgery if indicated in specific situations including TPIAT as a possible type of
  surgical intervention. Long-term sequelae of CP in patients with CF include exocrine
  pancreatic insufficiency treated with pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, fat-soluble
  vitamin deficiencies and associated metabolic complications such as bone disease/osteoporosis,
  pancreatogenic diabetes, and less commonly, pancreatic cancer. We review the presentation
  and etiologies of pancreatitis in CF patients as well as the management of AP and
  CP primarily in children.'
