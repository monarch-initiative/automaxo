input_text: 'Benzbromarone as adjuvant therapy for cystic fibrosis lung disease: a
  pilot clinical trial. OBJECTIVE: Cystic fibrosis (CF) affects multiple organs, the
  most severe consequences being observed in the lungs. Despite significant progress
  in developing CF transmembrane conductance regulator-specific treatments for CF
  lung disease, exploring alternative CF-targeted medications seems reasonable. We
  sought to evaluate the potential beneficial effects of oral benzbromarone as an
  adjuvant therapy in CF patients with reduced lung function. METHODS: This was a
  prospective open-label pilot study of oral benzbromarone (100 mg/day) administered
  once daily for 90 days. Patients were followed at a tertiary referral center in
  southern Brazil. Safety was assessed by the number of reported adverse events. Secondary
  objectives included percent predicted FEV1 (FEV1%) and pulmonary exacerbations.
  RESULTS: Ten patients were enrolled. Benzbromarone was found to be safe, with no
  serious drug-related adverse events. Eight patients completed the study; the median
  relative change in FEV1% tended to increase during the treatment, showing an 8%
  increase from baseline at the final visit. However, a nonparametric test showed
  that the change was not significant (p = 0.06). Of a total of ten patients, only
  one experienced at least one pulmonary exacerbation during the study. CONCLUSIONS:
  Oral benzbromarone appears to be safe, and improved FEV1% has been observed in patients
  with CF. Further assessment in larger trials is warranted to elucidate whether oral
  benzbromarone can be a potential adjuvant therapy for CF.'
