input_text: "Towards a Standardized Classification of the Hepatobiliary Manifestations
  in Cystic Fibrosis (CFHBI): A Joint ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN Position Paper.The broad spectrum
  of hepatobiliary involvement in cystic fibrosis (CF) has been commonly referred
  to as cystic fibrosis liver disease (CFLD). However, differences in the definitions
  of CFLD have led to variations in reported prevalence, incidence rates, and standardized
  recommendations for diagnosis and therapies. Harmonizing the description of the
  spectrum of hepatobiliary involvement in all people with CF (pwCF) is deemed essential
  for providing a reliable account of the natural history, which in turn supports
  the development of meaningful clinical outcomes in patient care and research. Recognizing
  this necessity, The European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology
  and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) and the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology,
  Hepatology and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) commissioned and tasked a committee to develop
  and propose a systematic classification of the CF hepatobiliary manifestations to
  increase uniformity, accuracy, and comparability for clinical, registry, and research
  purposes. This report describes the committee's combined expert position statement
  on hepatobiliary involvement in CF, which has been endorsed by NASPGHAN and ESPGHAN.
  We recommend using CFHBI (Cystic Fibrosis Hepato-Biliary Involvement) as the updated
  term to describe and classify all hepatobiliary manifestations in all pwCF. CFHBI
  encompasses the current extensive spectrum of phenotypical, clinical, or diagnostic
  expressions of liver involvement observed in pwCF. We present a schematic categorization
  of CFHBI, which may also be used to track and classify the changes and development
  of CFHBI in pwCF over time. The proposed classification for CFHBI is based on expert
  consensus and has not been validated for clinical practice and research purposes.
  Achieving validation should be an important aim for future research."
