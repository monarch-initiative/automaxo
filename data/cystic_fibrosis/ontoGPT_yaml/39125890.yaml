input_text: 'Phage Therapy: An Alternative Approach to Combating Multidrug-Resistant
  Bacterial Infections in Cystic Fibrosis. Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) are
  prone to developing life-threatening lung infections with a variety of pathogens
  that are difficult to eradicate, such as Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc), Hemophilus
  influenzae, Mycobacterium abscessus (Mab), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus
  aureus. These infections still remain an important issue, despite the therapy for
  CF having considerably improved in recent years. Moreover, prolonged exposure to
  antibiotics in combination favors the development and spread of multi-resistant
  bacteria; thus, the development of alternative strategies is crucial to counter
  antimicrobial resistance. In this context, phage therapy, i.e., the use of phages,
  viruses that specifically infect bacteria, has become a promising strategy. In this
  review, we aim to address the current status of phage therapy in the management
  of multidrug-resistant infections, from compassionate use cases to ongoing clinical
  trials, as well as the challenges this approach presents in the particular context
  of CF patients.'
