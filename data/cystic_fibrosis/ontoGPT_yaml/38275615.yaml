input_text: 'Aromatic L-Amino Acid Decarboxylase Deficiency: A Genetic Screening in
  Sicilian Patients with Neurological Disorders.Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase
  deficiency (AADCd) is a rare autosomal recessive neurometabolic disorder caused
  by AADC deficiency, an enzyme encoded by the DDC gene. Since the enzyme is involved
  in the biosynthesis of serotonin and dopamine, its deficiency determines the lack
  of these neurotransmitters, but also of norepinephrine and epinephrine. Onset is
  early and the key signs are hypotonia, movement disorders (oculogyric crises, dystonia
  and hypokinesia), developmental delay and autonomic dysfunction. Taiwan is the site
  of a potential founder variant (IVS6+4A>T) with a predicted incidence of 1/32,000
  births, while only 261 patients with this deficit have been described worldwide.
  Actually, the number of affected persons could be greater, given that the spectrum
  of clinical manifestations is broad and still little known. In our study we selected
  350 unrelated patients presenting with different neurological disorders including
  heterogeneous neuromuscular disorders, cognitive deficit, behavioral disorders and
  autism spectrum disorder, for which the underlying etiology had not yet been identified.
  Molecular investigation of the DDC gene was carried out with the aim of identifying
  affected patients and/or carriers. Our study shows a high frequency of carriers
  (2.57%) in Sicilian subjects with neurological deficits, with a higher concentration
  in northern and eastern Sicily. Assuming these data as representative of the general
  Sicilian population, the risk may be comparable to some rare diseases included in
  the newborn screening programs such as spinal muscular atrophy, cystic fibrosis
  and phenylketonuria.'
