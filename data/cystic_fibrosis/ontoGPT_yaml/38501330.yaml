input_text: 'A comparison of aminoglycoside antibiotic serum concentrations collected
  by peripheral veins and peripherally inserted central catheters in adults with cystic
  fibrosis. BACKGROUND: People with cystic fibrosis (PwCF) are frequently hospitalized
  for treatment of pulmonary exacerbation. The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Pulmonary
  Guidelines support the use of intravenous aminoglycosides with therapeutic drug
  monitoring for the treatment of pulmonary exacerbation due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
  Serum intravenous tobramycin concentrations are commonly collected by peripheral
  venipuncture (PV). Discomfort associated with collection of samples by PV prompts
  collection via PICC, but the accuracy of intravenous tobramycin serum levels collected
  by PICC has not been documented in adult PwCF. The primary study objective was to
  evaluate the difference between intravenous tobramycin serum levels collected by
  PV and PICC in adult PwCF. METHODS: The authors conducted a prospective case-control
  study of adult PwCF admitted to University of Utah Health for a pulmonary exacerbation
  receiving tobramycin by a single lumen PICC. The authors compared tobramycin peak
  and random serum levels collected by PV and PICC using a detailed flush and waste
  protocol. RESULTS: The authors analyzed a total of 19 patients with peripheral and
  PICC samples. The mean tobramycin peak collected by PV (27.2 mcg/mL) was similar
  to the mean peak collected by PICC (26.9 mcg/mL) (paired samples Wilcoxon signed-rank
  test, p = .94). The correlation coefficient was 0.88 (95% CI = 0.85-0.91, p < .001).
  CONCLUSION: Tobramycin serum samples collected by PICC appear to be similar in value
  to PV collections. Collecting aminoglycoside levels by PICC rather than PV may reduce
  patient discomfort and improve quality of life. Additional multicenter studies are
  needed to confirm these results.'
