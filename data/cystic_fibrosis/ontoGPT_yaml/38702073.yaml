input_text: Considerations for the use of inhaled antibiotics for Pseudomonas aeruginosa
  in people with cystic fibrosis receiving CFTR modulator therapy. The major cause
  of mortality in people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) is progressive lung disease characterised
  by acute and chronic infections, the accumulation of mucus, airway inflammation,
  structural damage and pulmonary exacerbations. The prevalence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa
  rises rapidly in the teenage years, and this organism is the most common cause of
  chronic lung infection in adults with cystic fibrosis (CF). It is associated with
  an accelerated decline in lung function and premature death. New P. aeruginosa infections
  are treated with antibiotics to eradicate the organism, while chronic infections
  require long-term inhaled antibiotic therapy. The prevalence of P. aeruginosa infections
  has decreased in CF registries since the introduction of CF transmembrane conductance
  regulator modulators (CFTRm), but clinical observations suggest that chronic P.
  aeruginosa infections usually persist in patients receiving CFTRm. This indicates
  that pwCF may still need inhaled antibiotics in the CFTRm era to maintain long-term
  control of P. aeruginosa infections. Here, we provide an overview of the changing
  perceptions of P. aeruginosa infection management, including considerations on detection
  and treatment, the therapy burden associated with inhaled antibiotics and the potential
  effects of CFTRm on the lung microbiome. We conclude that updated guidance is required
  on the diagnosis and management of P. aeruginosa infection. In particular, we highlight
  a need for prospective studies to evaluate the consequences of stopping inhaled
  antibiotic therapy in pwCF who have chronic P. aeruginosa infection and are receiving
  CFTRm. This will help inform new guidelines on the use of antibiotics alongside
  CFTRm.
