input_text: 'Risk of CFTR-related disorders and cystic fibrosis in an Italian cohort
  of CRMS/CFSPID subjects in preschool and school age.The identification of cystic
  fibrosis screening-positive, inconclusive diagnosis (CFSPID) in infants is a controversial
  outcome of newborn screening for cystic fibrosis (CF). Today, despite improvements
  in the knowledge of CFSPID and the description of several cohorts, little data are
  available on cohorts with a follow-up period of more than 6 years. In this study,
  we report the outcomes of an Italian cohort of CFSPID individuals with CFSPID or
  formerly CFTR-related disorders (CFTR-RD) (CFSPID > CFTR-RD) or diagnosed with CF
  (CFSPID > CF). This was an observational and multicentre Italian study collecting
  clinical data on CFSPID born between the period January 1, 2011, and December 13,
  2019. A total of 268 participants were included: 243 with persistent CFSPID, 7 with
  CFSPID > CFTR-RD, and 18 with CFSPID > CF. The trend of sweat chloride (SC) values,
  percentage of definitive diagnoses, lung function in school-aged children, and development
  of CF-related complications were evaluated. At the end of the observation period,
  almost 80% of the individuals with CFSPID did not have a conclusive diagnosis. A
  total of 29 children (10.8%) transitioned to a diagnosis of CF for pathological
  SC values (>= 60 mmol/L) or multi-organ involvement, and 18 (6.7%) to CFTR-RD. Children
  who were followed up for > 6 years (median age, 7.5 years; range, 6.04-10.5) had
  normal lung function and were pancreatic sufficient, and the evolution in CF was
  only present in two cases. CONCLUSION: Most Italian preschool and school-aged children
  with CFSPID did not have a conclusive diagnosis, and progression to CF was unlikely
  in children > 6 years of age. An annual follow-up could be indicated to identify
  early evolution in clinical features consistent with a CFTR-RD. WHAT IS KNOWN:   Cystic
  Fibrosis newborn screening identifies also subjects with an inconclusive diagnosis
  (CFSPID).   Over time a variable percentage of CFSPIDs will be diagnosed as CF.   Little
  data is available on CFSPIDs with a follow-up period of more than six years. WHAT
  IS NEW:   80% of Italian preschool and school-age CFSPIDs not have a conclusive
  diagnosis.   Italian preschool and school-age CFSPIDs have normal lung function
  and are pancreatic sufficient.   Annual follow-up after 6 years is recommended in
  CFSPID with abnormal LCI2.5 or with a CF-causing variant in trans with a VVCC.'
