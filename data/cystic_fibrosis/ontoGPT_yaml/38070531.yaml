input_text: 'A core outcome set for bronchiectasis in children and adolescents for
  use in clinical research: an international consensus study.Improving the treatment
  of non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis in children and adolescents requires high-quality
  research with outcomes that meet study objectives and are meaningful for patients
  and their parents and caregivers. In the absence of systematic reviews or agreement
  on the health outcomes that should be measured in paediatric bronchiectasis, we
  established an international, multidisciplinary panel of experts to develop a core
  outcome set (COS) that incorporates patient and parent perspectives. We undertook
  a systematic review from which a list of 21 outcomes was constructed; these outcomes
  were used to inform the development of separate surveys for ranking by parents and
  patients and by health-care professionals. 562 participants (201 parents and patients
  from 17 countries, 361 health-care professionals from 58 countries) completed the
  surveys. Following two consensus meetings, agreement was reached on a ten-item COS
  with five outcomes that were deemed to be essential: quality of life, symptoms,
  exacerbation frequency, non-scheduled health-care visits, and hospitalisations.
  Use of this international consensus-based COS will ensure that studies have consistent,
  patient-focused outcomes, facilitating research worldwide and, in turn, the development
  of evidence-based guidelines for improved clinical care and outcomes. Further research
  is needed to develop validated, accessible measurement instruments for several of
  the outcomes in this COS.'
