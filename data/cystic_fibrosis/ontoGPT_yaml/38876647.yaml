input_text: 'Effectiveness of manual therapy interventions in cystic fibrosis care:
  a pilot study. BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a severe genetic condition that
  affects multiple organ systems and imposes a substantial treatment burden. Regarding
  the lungs and airways, the progressive pathophysiological changes place a significant
  strain on the musculoskeletal components of the respiratory system for people with
  CF. This pilot study investigated the effectiveness of manual therapy interventions
  (MTIs) on thoracic mobility, respiratory muscle strength, lung function, and musculoskeletal
  pain. METHOD: A study with a pretest-posttest design was conducted with 15 eligible
  people with CF at the Sahlgrenska University Hospital CF Centre. After an initial
  set of diagnostic tests at baseline, the participants underwent eight weekly 30-min
  MTIs. The MTIs included passive joint mobilisation and soft tissue manipulation
  of primary and secondary anatomical areas of the musculoskeletal respiratory system.
  On the day of the final intervention, the baseline measurements were repeated. RESULTS:
  Trends of increased thoracic mobility were observed following the intervention,
  with a statistically significant increase in respiratory muscle strength. No change
  in lung function was observed. Musculoskeletal pain before and after the intervention
  showed a significant decrease in tender points, and all participants reported positive
  experiences with MTIs. CONCLUSION: MTIs may improve thoracic mobility, alleviate
  pain, and enhance respiratory muscle strength in people with CF. Further research
  is needed to confirm their potential role as a CF physiotherapy supplement. CLINICAL
  TRIAL ID: NCT04696198.'
