input_text: 'Safety and efficacy of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor in people with
  Cystic Fibrosis following liver transplantation: A systematic review. BACKGROUND
  & AIMS: Cystic Fibrosis (CF) liver disease progresses to liver failure requiring
  transplantation in about 3 % of patients, 0.7 % of CF patients are post liver transplant.
  The prognosis of CF has improved with the introduction of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor
  (ETI). Due to the paucity of data and concerns regarding interactions with immunosuppressive
  drug regimens, there is no general consensus on use of ETI post liver transplantation.
  The aim of this review is to report the safety and efficacy of ETI in CF patients
  who underwent liver transplantation. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted
  through MEDLINE/Pubmed and EMBASE databases. English-written articles reporting
  clinical data on liver transplanted CF patients treated with ETI were included.
  Article quality was evaluated using the Critical Appraisal Checklist for Case Reports.
  RESULTS: Twenty cases were retrieved from 6 reports. Temporary discontinuation and/or
  dose reduction due to elevated transaminases was required in 5 cases. ETI restarted
  on a reduced dose was tolerated in 3 out of 5 patients, 1 patient tolerated full
  dose. Tacrolimus dose change was required in 14 cases, in 1 case ETI was discontinued
  due to tacrolimus toxicity. Improvement in percentage predicted FEV1 was noted in
  15/19 patients (median +17 %, range 8 %-38 %). CONCLUSIONS: In the majority of liver
  transplanted patients ETI is well tolerated, although adverse events and liver function
  abnormalities may occur. Close monitoring of liver function and tacrolimus level
  is warranted. Significant improvement in lung function after ETI initiation is confirmed,
  highlighting the importance of accessing this medication for this group of patients.'
