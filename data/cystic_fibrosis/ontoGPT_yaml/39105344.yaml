input_text: 'Advanced cystic fibrosis liver disease: Endovascular, endoscopic, radiologic,
  and surgical considerations. Up to 90% of people with CF (pwCF) will have some form
  of hepatobiliary involvement. This manuscript aims to explore the different endovascular,
  endoscopic, radiological and surgical procedures available to diagnose and manage
  the most severe form of CF hepatobiliary involvement (CFHBI) known as advanced cystic
  fibrosis liver disease (aCFLD), seen in 10% of pwCF. These procedures and interventions
  include liver biopsy, hepatic venous pressure gradient measurement, gastrostomy
  tube placement to optimize nutrition, paracentesis, endoscopic variceal control
  of bleeding and portosystemic shunting before liver transplantation. By utilizing
  advanced diagnostic or surgical techniques, healthcare professionals of pwCF can
  more effectively manage patients with CFHBI and aCFLD and potentially improve patient
  outcomes.'
