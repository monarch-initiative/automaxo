input_text: '[Therapeutics in cystic fibrosis: Clinical revolution and new challenges].
  Over time, cystic fibrosis has become a model of synergy between research in pathophysiology
  and cell biology, and clinical advances. Therapies targeting the CFTR protein, in
  particular CFTR modulators, have transformed the prognosis of patients, bringing
  the hope of a normal life with the possibility of starting a family and growing
  old, challenging established statistics. However, patients are not yet cured, and
  side effects remain insufficiently documented. Epidemiological changes create new
  challenges for the management of cystic fibrosis. Approximately 10 % of patients
  still lack a therapeutic option. The community of researchers, pharmaceutical industries,
  patient associations, and health authorities remains committed to monitor the long-term
  effects of these still poorly characterised treatments, and to explore new pharmacological
  approaches, such as gene therapies.'
