input_text: 'Early glucose abnormalities revealed by continuous glucose monitoring
  associate with lung function decline in cystic fibrosis: A five-year prospective
  study.BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD) is commonly associated
  with declining lung function and nutritional status. We aimed to evaluate the pulmonary
  impact of early glucose abnormalities by using 2-h standard oral glucose tolerance
  testing (OGTT) and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in people with cystic fibrosis
  (PwCF). METHODS: PwCF aged >=10 years old without known CFRD were included in a
  five-year prospective multicentre study. Annual evaluation of nutritional status,
  lung function, OGTT and CGM was set up. Associations between annual rate changes
  (Delta) in lung function, DeltaFEV1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 s) percentage
  predicted (pp) and DeltaFVC (forced vital capacity) pp., and annual rate changes
  in OGTT or CGM variables were estimated with a mixed model with a random effect
  for subject. RESULTS: From 2009 to 2016, 112 PwCF (age: 21 +- 11 years, BMI (body
  mass index) z-score: -0.55 +- 1.09, FEV1pp: 77 +- 24 %, 2-h OGTT glucose: 122 +-
  44 mg/dL, AUC (area under curve) >140 mg/dL: 1 mg/dL/day (0.2, 3.0) were included.
  A total of 428 OGTTs and 480 CGMs were collected. The participants presented annual
  decline of FVCpp and FEV1pp at -1.0 % per year (-1.6, -0.4), p < 0.001 and - 1.9
  % per year (-2.5, -1.3), p < 0.001 respectively without change in BMI z-score during
  the study. Variation of two-hour OGTT glucose was not associated with declining
  lung function, as measured by DeltaFEV1pp (p = 0.94) and DeltaFVCpp (p = 0.90).
  Among CGM variables, only increase in AUC >140 mg/dL between two annual visits was
  associated with a decrease in DeltaFVCpp (p < 0.05) and DeltaFEV1pp (p < 0.05).
  CONCLUSIONS: This prospective study supports the fact that early glucose abnormalities
  revealed by CGM predict pulmonary function decline in PwCF, while 2-h standard OGTT
  glucose is not associated with pulmonary impairment.'
