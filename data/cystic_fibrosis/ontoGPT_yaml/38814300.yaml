input_text: 'Extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal for acute hypercapnic respiratory
  failure in a child with cystic fibrosis. BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory failure is
  a prevalent condition in childhood with a high rate of mortality. Invasive mechanical
  ventilation support may be required for the management of these patients. Extracorporeal
  membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a method used when ventilation support is insufficient.
  However, the less invasive extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal method can be used
  as an alternative in cases of hypercapnic respiratory failure. CASE: A 9-year-old
  patient with cystic fibrosis presented to the hospital with acute respiratory failure
  due to pneumonia. Bilateral patchy areas of consolidation were evident in the chest
  x-ray. Invasive mechanical ventilation support was consequently provided to treat
  severe hypercapnia. Although peak and plateau pressure levels exceeded 32 cmH2O
  (49 cmH2O) and 28 cmH2O (35 cmH2O), respectively, the patient continued to have
  severe respiratory acidosis. Therefore extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal support
  was initiated to provide lung-protective ventilation. By Day 10, venovenous ECMO
  support was initiated due to deteriorating oxygenation. CONCLUSION: In cases where
  conventional invasive mechanical ventilation support is insufficient due to acute
  hypercapnic respiratory failure, extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal support,
  which is less invasive compared to ECMO, should be considered as an effective and
  reliable alternative method. However, it should be noted that extracorporeal carbon
  dioxide removal support does not affect oxygenation; it functions solely as a carbon
  dioxide removal system.'
