input_text: 'Eradication treatment for Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in adults
  with bronchiectasis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.INTRODUCTION: Pseudomonas
  aeruginosa is the most commonly isolated pathogen in bronchiectasis and is associated
  with worse outcomes. Eradication treatment is recommended by guidelines, but the
  evidence base is limited. The expected success rate of eradication in clinical practice
  is not known. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis according
  to Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. PubMed, Embase,
  the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Clinicaltrials.gov were searched
  for studies investigating P. aeruginosa eradication treatment using antibiotics
  (systemic or inhaled) in patients with bronchiectasis. The primary outcome was the
  percentage of patients negative for P. aeruginosa at 12 months after eradication
  treatment. Cystic fibrosis was excluded. RESULTS: Six observational studies including
  289 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Our meta-analysis found a 12-month
  P. aeruginosa eradication rate of 40% (95% CI 34-45%; p<0.00001), with no significant
  heterogeneity (I2=0%). Combined systemic and inhaled antibiotic treatment was associated
  with a higher eradication rate (48%, 95% CI 41-55%) than systemic antibiotics alone
  (27%, 13-45%). CONCLUSION: Eradication treatment in bronchiectasis results in eradication
  of P. aeruginosa from sputum in ~40% of cases at 12 months. Combined systemic and
  inhaled antibiotics achieve higher eradication rates than systemic antibiotics alone.'
