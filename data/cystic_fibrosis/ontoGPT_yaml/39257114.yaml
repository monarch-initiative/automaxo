input_text: "Influenza A (H1N1) in Hospitalized Children. BACKGROUND: Influenza A
  (H1N1) is a contagious respiratory infection caused by the influenza A virus. In
  the majority of cases, H1N1 influenza is benign. However, it can be dangerous for
  infants and children with underlying chronic diseases. The severity of influenza
  depends on various factors, including the virulence of the virus strain, preexisting
  immunity level, and individual health conditions. The aim of this study is to describe
  the clinical profile of H1N1 influenza in hospitalized infants and children. METHODS:
  This is a prospective and descriptive study conducted from November 1, 2018, to
  January 31, 2024. In this study, we included all children under 14 years old hospitalized
  for suspected severe lower respiratory infection who had gone through virological
  testing. We used a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) kit: the Film Array-Respiratory
  Panel. Due to the depletion of multiplex PCR kits, this study continued using rapid
  influenza diagnostic tests based on immunochromatographic technique. RESULTS: We
  report 45 confirmed cases of H1N1 influenza, collected during the period from November
  1, 2018, to January 31, 2024. The average age was 2 years and 4 months. The main
  reason for admission was respiratory distress found in all patients. In 53% of the
  cases, there was an associated comorbidity, including asthma (17 cases), prematurity
  (2 cases), congenital adrenal hyperplasia (2 cases), cystic fibrosis (1 case), undetermined
  etiology bronchial dilation (1 case), and Basedow's disease (1 case). The clinical
  presentation included viral bronchiolitis (17 cases), moderate asthma exacerbation
  (10 cases), severe asthma exacerbation (7 cases), pneumonia (9 cases), bronchial
  dilation exacerbation (1 case), and flu-like syndrome with adrenal insufficiency
  (1 case). Fever was present in 31 patients. Gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea
  and vomiting were present in 20 cases. Three patients required intensive care, with
  2 children being intubated and ventilated (one severe acute asthma and one severe
  viral bronchiolitis). Two cases were treated with oseltamivir. The average length
  of hospital stay was 7.5 days, ranging from 3 to 20 days. All cases showed favorable
  evolution. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that preventive measures remain crucial, and
  influenza vaccination is highly recommended in cases of underlying morbidity."
