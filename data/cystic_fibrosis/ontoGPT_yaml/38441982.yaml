input_text: 'In vitro activity of human defensins HNP-1 and hBD-3 against multidrug-resistant
  ESKAPE Gram-negatives of clinical origin and selected peptidoglycan recycling-defective
  mutants.The use of immune compounds as antimicrobial adjuvants is a classic idea
  recovering timeliness in the current antibiotic resistance scenario. However, the
  activity of certain antimicrobial peptides against ESKAPE Gram-negatives has not
  been sufficiently investigated. The objective of this study was to determine the
  activities of human defensins HNP-1 and hBD-3 alone or combined with permeabilizing/peptidoglycan-targeting
  agents against clinical ESKAPE Gram-negatives [Acinetobacter baumannii (AB), Enterobacter
  cloacae (EC), Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP), and acute/chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa
  (PA)]. Lethal concentrations (LCs) of HNP-1 and hBD-3 were determined in four collections
  of multidrug resistant EC, AB, KP, and PA clinical strains (10-36 isolates depending
  on the collection). These defensins act through membrane permeabilization plus peptidoglycan
  building blockade, enabling that alterations in peptidoglycan recycling may increase
  their activity, which is why different recycling-defective mutants were also included.
  Combinations with physiological lysozyme and subinhibitory colistin for bactericidal
  activities determination, and with meropenem for minimum inhibitory concentrations
  (MICs), were also assessed. HNP-1 showed undetectable activity (LC > 32 mg/L for
  all strains). hBD-3 showed appreciable activities: LC ranges 2-16, 8-8, 8->32, and
  8->32 mg/L for AB, EC, KP, and PA, being PA strains from cystic fibrosis significantly
  more resistant than acute origin ones. None of the peptidoglycan recycling-defective
  mutants showed greater susceptibility to HNP-1/hBD-3. Combination with colistin
  or lysozyme did not change their bactericidal power, and virtually neither did meropenem
  + hBD-3 compared to meropenem MICs. This is the first study comparatively analyzing
  the HNP-1/hBD-3 activities against the ESKAPE Gram-negatives, and demonstrates interesting
  bactericidal capacities of hBD-3 mostly against AB and EC. IMPORTANCE: In the current
  scenario of critical need for new antimicrobials against multidrug-resistant bacteria,
  all options must be considered, including classic ideas such as the use of purified
  immune compounds. However, information regarding the activity of certain human defensins
  against ESKAPE Gram-negatives was incomplete. This is the first study comparatively
  assessing the in vitro activity of two membrane-permeabilizing/peptidoglycan construction-blocking
  defensins (HNP-1 and hBD-3) against relevant clinical collections of ESKAPE Gram-negatives,
  alone or in combination with permeabilizers, additional peptidoglycan-targeting
  attacks, or the blockade of its recycling. Our data suggest that hBD-3 has a notable
  bactericidal activity against multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and Enterobacter
  cloacae strains that should be considered as potential adjuvant option. Our results
  suggest for the first time an increased resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains
  from chronic infection compared to acute origin ones, and provide new clues about
  the predominant mode of action of hBD-3 against Gram-negatives (permeabilization
  rather than peptidoglycan-targeting).'
