input_text: "[Standard technical specifications for methacholine chloride (Methacholine)
  bronchial challenge test (2023)].The methacholine challenge test (MCT) is a standard
  evaluation method of assessing airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and its severity,
  and has significant clinical value in the diagnosis and treatment of bronchial asthma.
  A consensus working group consisting of experts from the Pulmonary Function and
  Clinical Respiratory Physiology Committee of the Chinese Association of Chest Physicians,
  the Task Force for Pulmonary Function of the Chinese Thoracic Society, and the Pulmonary
  Function Group of Respiratory Branch of the Chinese Geriatric Society jointly developed
  this consensus. Based on the \"Guidelines for Pulmonary Function-Bronchial Provocation
  Test\" published in 2014, the issues encountered in its use, and recent developments,
  the group has updated the Standard technical specifications of methacholine chloride
  (methacholine) bronchial challenge test (2023). Through an extensive collection
  of expert opinions, literature reviews, questionnaire surveys, and multiple rounds
  of online and offline discussions, the consensus addressed the eleven core issues
  in MCT's clinical practice, including indications, contraindications, preparation
  of provocative agents, test procedures and methods, quality control, safety management,
  interpretation of results, and reporting standards. The aim was to provide clinical
  pulmonary function practitioners in healthcare institutions with the tools to optimize
  the use of this technique to guide clinical diagnosis and treatment.Summary of recommendationsQuestion
  1: Who is suitable for conducting MCT? What are contraindications for performing
  MCT?Patients with atypical symptoms and a clinical suspicion of asthma, patients
  diagnosed with asthma requiring assessment of the severity of airway hyperresponsiveness,
  individuals with allergic rhinitis who are at risk of developing asthma, patients
  in need of evaluating the effectiveness of asthma treatment, individuals in occupations
  with high safety risks due to airway hyperresponsiveness, patients with chronic
  diseases prone to airway hyperresponsiveness, others requiring assessment of airway
  reactivity.Absolute contraindications: (1) Patients who are allergic to methacholine
  (MCh) or other parasympathomimetic drugs, with allergic reactions including rash,
  itching/swelling (especially of the face, tongue, and throat), severe dizziness,
  and dyspnea; (2) Patients with a history of life-threatening asthma attacks or those
  who have required mechanical ventilation for asthma attacks in the past three months;
  (3) Patients with moderate to severe impairment of baseline pulmonary function [Forced
  Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1) less than 60% of the predicted value or FEV1<1.0
  L]; (4) Severe urticaria; (5) Other situations inappropriate for forced vital capacity
  (FVC) measurement, such as myocardial infarction or stroke in the past three months,
  poorly controlled hypertension, aortic aneurysm, recent eye surgery, or increased
  intracranial pressure.Relative contraindications: (1) Moderate or more severe impairment
  of baseline lung function (FEV1%pred<70%), but individuals with FEV1%pred>60% may
  still be considered for MCT with strict observation and adequate preparation; (2)
  Experiencing asthma acute exacerbation; (3) Poor cooperation with baseline lung
  function tests that do not meet quality control requirements; (4) Recent respiratory
  tract infection (<4 weeks); (5) Pregnant or lactating women; (6) Patients currently
  using cholinesterase inhibitors (for the treatment of myasthenia gravis); (7) Patients
  who have previously experienced airway spasm during pulmonary function tests, with
  a significant decrease in FEV1 even without the inhalation of provocative.Question
  2: How to prepare and store the challenge solution for MCT?Before use, the drug
  must be reconstituted and then diluted into various concentrations for provocation.
  The dilution concentration and steps for MCh vary depending on the inhalation method
  and provocation protocol used. It is important to follow specific steps. Typically,
  a specified amount of diluent is added to the methacholine reagent bottle for reconstitution,
  and the mixture is shaken until the solution becomes clear. The diluent is usually
  physiological saline, but saline with phenol (0.4%) can also be used. Phenol can
  reduce the possibility of bacterial contamination, and its presence does not interfere
  with the provocation test. After reconstitution, other concentrations of MCh solution
  are prepared using the same diluent, following the dilution steps, and then stored
  separately in sterile containers. Preparers should carefully verify and label the
  concentration and preparation time of the solution and complete a preparation record
  form. The reconstituted and diluted MCh solution is ready for immediate use without
  the need for freezing. It can be stored for two weeks if refrigerated (2-8 C). The
  reconstituted solution should not be stored directly in the nebulizer reservoir
  to prevent crystallization from blocking the capillary opening and affecting aerosol
  output. The temperature of the solution can affect the production of the nebulizer
  and cause airway spasms in the subject upon inhaling cold droplets. Thus, refrigerated
  solutions should be brought to room temperature before use.Question 3: What preparation
  is required for subjects prior to MCT?(1) Detailed medical history inquiry and exclusion
  of contraindications.(2) Inquiring about factors and medications that may affect
  airway reactivity and assessing compliance with medication washout requirements:
  When the goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of asthma treatment, bronchodilators
  other than those used for asthma treatment do not need to be discontinued. Antihistamines
  and cromolyn have no effect on MCT responses, and the effects of a single dose of
  inhaled corticosteroids and leukotriene modifiers are minimal, thus not requiring
  cessation before the test. For patients routinely using corticosteroids, whether
  to discontinue the medication depends on the objective of the test: if assisting
  in the diagnosis of asthma, differential diagnosis, aiding in step-down therapy
  for asthma, or exploring the effect of discontinuing anti-inflammatory treatment,
  corticosteroids should be stopped before the provocation test; if the patient is
  already diagnosed with asthma and the objective is to observe the level of airway
  reactivity under controlled medication conditions, then discontinuation is not necessary.
  Medications such as IgE monoclonal antibodies, IL-4Ralpha monoclonal antibodies,
  traditional Chinese medicine, and ethnic medicines may interfere with test results,
  and clinicians should decide whether to discontinue these based on the specific
  circumstances.(3) Explaining the test procedure and potential adverse reactions,
  and obtaining informed consent if necessary.Question 4: What are the methods of
  the MCT? And which ones are recommended in current clinical practice?Commonly used
  methods for MCT in clinical practice include the quantitative nebulization method
  (APS method), Forced Oscillalion method (Astograph method), 2-minute tidal breathing
  method (Cockcroft method), hand-held quantitative nebulization method (Yan method),
  and 5-breath method (Chai 5-breath method). The APS method allows for precise dosing
  of inhaled Methacholine, ensuring accurate and reliable results. The Astograph method,
  which uses respiratory resistance as an assessment indicator, is easy for subjects
  to perform and is the simplest operation. These two methods are currently the most
  commonly used clinical practice in China.Question 5: What are the steps involved
  in MCT?The MCT consists of the following four steps:(1) Baseline lung function test:
  After a 15-minute rest period, the subjects assumes a seated position and wear a
  nose clip for the measurement of pulmonary function indicators [such as FEV1 or
  respiratory resistance (Rrs)]. FEV1 should be measured at least three times according
  to spirometer quality control standards, ensuring that the best two measurements
  differ by less than 150 ml and recording the highest value as the baseline. Usually,
  if FEV1%pred is below 70%, proceeding with the challenge test is not suitable, and
  a bronchodilation test should be considered. However, if clinical assessment of
  airway reactivity is necessary and FEV1%pred is between 60% and 70%, the provocation
  test may still be conducted under close observation, ensuring the subject's safety.
  If FEV1%pred is below 60%, it is an absolute contraindication for MCT.(2) Inhalation
  of diluent and repeat lung function test for control values: the diluent, serving
  as a control for the inhaled MCh, usually does not significantly impact the subject's
  lung function. the higher one between baseline value and the post-dilution FEV1
  is used as the reference for calculating the rate of FEV1 decline. If post-inhalation
  FEV1 decreases, there are usually three scenarios: (1)If FEV1 decreases by less
  than 10% compared to the baseline, the test can proceed, continue the test and administer
  the first dose of MCh. (2)If the FEV1 decreases by>=10% and<20%, indicating a heightened
  airway reactivity to the diluent, proceed with the lowest concentration (dose) of
  the provoking if FEV1%pred has not yet reached the contraindication criteria for
  the MCT. if FEV1%pred<60% and the risk of continuing the challenge test is considerable,
  it is advisable to switch to a bronchodilation test and indicate the change in the
  test results report. (3)If FEV1 decreases by>=20%, it can be directly classified
  as a positive challenge test, and the test should be discontinued, with bronchodilators
  administered to alleviate airway obstruction.(3) Inhalation of MCh and repeat lung
  function test to assess decline: prepare a series of MCh concentrations, starting
  from the lowest and gradually increasing the inhaled concentration (dose) using
  different methods. Perform pulmonary function tests at 30 seconds and 90 seconds
  after completing nebulization, with the number of measurements limited to 3-4 times.
  A complete Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) measurement is unnecessary during testing;
  only an acceptable FEV1 measurement is required. The interval between two consecutive
  concentrations (doses) generally should not exceed 3 minutes. If FEV1 declines by>=10%
  compared to the control value, reduce the increment of methacholine concentration
  (dose) and adjust the inhalation protocol accordingly. If FEV1 declines by>=20%
  or more compared to the control value or if the maximum concentration (amount) has
  been inhaled, the test should be stopped. After inhaling the MCh, close observation
  of the subject's response is necessary. If necessary, monitor blood oxygen saturation
  and auscultate lung breath sounds. The test should be promptly discontinued in case
  of noticeable clinical symptoms or signs.(4) Inhalation of bronchodilator and repeat
  lung function test to assess recovery: when the bronchial challenge test shows a
  positive response (FEV1 decline>=20%) or suspiciously positive, the subject should
  receive inhaled rapid-acting bronchodilators, such as short-acting beta-agonists
  (SABA) or short-acting muscarinic antagonists (SAMA). Suppose the subject exhibits
  obvious symptoms of breathlessness, wheezing, or typical asthma manifestations,
  and wheezing is audible in the lungs, even if the positive criteria are not met.
  In that case, the challenge test should be immediately stopped, and rapid-acting
  bronchodilators should be administered. Taking salbutamol as an example, inhale
  200-400 mug (100 mug per puff, 2-4 puffs, as determined by the physician based on
  the subject's condition). Reassess pulmonary function after 5-10 minutes. If FEV1
  recovers to within 10% of the baseline value, the test can be concluded. However,
  if there is no noticeable improvement (FEV1 decline still>=10%), record the symptoms
  and signs and repeat the bronchodilation procedure as mentioned earlier. Alternatively,
  add Ipratropium bromide (SAMA) or further administer nebulized bronchodilators and
  corticosteroids for intensified treatment while keeping the subject under observation
  until FEV1 recovers to within 90% of the baseline value before allowing the subject
  to leave.Question 6: What are the quality control requirements for the APS and Astograph
  MCT equipment?(1) APS Method Equipment Quality Control: The APS method for MCT uses
  a nebulizing inhalation device that requires standardized flowmeters, compressed
  air power source pressure and flow, and nebulizer aerosol output. Specific quality
  control methods are as follows:a. Flow and volume calibration of the quantitative
  nebulization device: Connect the flowmeter, an empty nebulization chamber, and a
  nebulization filter in sequence, attaching the compressed air source to the bottom
  of the chamber to ensure airtight connections. Then, attach a 3 L calibration syringe
  to the subject's breathing interface and simulate the flow during nebulization (typically
  low flow:<2 L/s) to calibrate the flow and volume. If calibration results exceed
  the acceptable range of the device's technical standards, investigate and address
  potential issues such as air leaks or increased resistance due to a damp filter,
  then recalibrate. Cleaning the flowmeter or replacing the filter can change the
  resistance in the breathing circuit, requiring re-calibration of the flow.b. Testing
  the compressed air power source: Regularly test the device, connecting the components
  as mentioned above. Then, block the opening of the nebulization device with a stopper
  or hand, start the compressed air power source, and test its pressure and flow.
  If the test results do not meet the technical standards, professional maintenance
  of the equipment may be required.c. Verification of aerosol output of the nebulization
  chamber: Regularly verify all nebulization chambers used in provocation tests. Steps
  include adding a certain amount of saline to the chamber, weighing and recording
  the chamber's weight (including saline), connecting the nebulizer to the quantitative
  nebulization device, setting the nebulization time, starting nebulization, then
  weighing and recording the post-nebulization weight. Calculate the unit time aerosol
  output using the formula [(weight before nebulization-weight after nebulization)/nebulization
  time]. Finally, set the nebulization plan for the provocation test based on the
  aerosol output, considering the MCh concentration, single inhalation nebulization
  duration, number of nebulization, and cumulative dose to ensure precise dosing of
  the inhaled MCh.(2) Astograph method equipment quality control: Astograph method
  equipment for MCT consists of a respiratory resistance monitoring device and a nebulization
  medication device. Perform zero-point calibration, volume calibration, impedance
  verification, and nebulization chamber checks daily before tests to ensure the resistance
  measurement system and nebulization system function properly. Calibration is needed
  every time the equipment is turned on, and more frequently if there are significant
  changes in environmental conditions.a. Zero-point calibration: Perform zero-point
  calibration before testing each subject. Ensure the nebulization chamber is properly
  installed and plugged with no air leaks.b. Volume calibration: Use a 3 L calibration
  syringe to calibrate the flow sensor at a low flow rate (approximately 1 L/s).c.
  Resistance verification: Connect low impedance tubes (1.9-2.2 cmH2O L-1 s-1) and
  high impedance tubes (10.2-10.7 cmH2O L-1 s-1) to the device interface for verification.d.
  Bypass check: Start the bypass check and record the bypass value; a value>150 ml/s
  is normal.e. Nebulization chamber check: Check each of the 12 nebulization chambers
  daily, especially those containing bronchodilators, to ensure normal spraying. The
  software can control each nebulization chamber to produce spray automatically for
  a preset duration (e.g., 2 seconds). Observe the formation of water droplets on
  the chamber walls, indicating normal spraying. If no nebulization occurs, check
  for incorrect connections or blockages.Question 7: How to set up and select the
  APS method in MCT?The software program of the aerosol provocation system in the
  quantitative nebulization method can independently set the nebulizer output, concentration
  of the methacholine agent, administration time, and number of administrations and
  combine these parameters to create the challenge test process. In principle, the
  concentration of the methacholine agent should increase from low to high, and the
  dose should increase from small to large. According to the standard, a 2-fold or
  4-fold incremental challenge process is generally used. In clinical practice, the
  dose can be simplified for subjects with good baseline lung function and no history
  of wheezing, such as using a recommended 2-concentration, 5-step method (25 and
  50 g/L) and (6.25 and 25 g/L). Suppose FEV1 decreases by more than 10% compared
  to the baseline during the test to ensure subject safety. In that case, the incremental
  dose of the methacholine agent can be reduced, and the inhalation program can be
  adjusted appropriately. If the subject's baseline lung function declines or has
  recent daytime or nighttime symptoms such as wheezing or chest tightness, a low
  concentration, low dose incremental process should be selected.Question 8: What
  are the precautions for the operation process of the Astograph method in MCT?(1)
  Test equipment: The Astograph method utilizes the forced oscillation technique,
  applying a sinusoidal oscillating pressure at the mouthpiece during calm breathing.
  Subjects inhale nebulized MCh of increasing concentrations while continuous monitoring
  of respiratory resistance (Rrs) plots the changes, assessing airway reactivity and
  sensitivity. The nebulization system employs jet nebulization technology, comprising
  a compressed air pump and 12 nebulization cups. The first cup contains saline, cups
  2 to 11 contain increasing concentrations of MCh, and the 12th cup contains a bronchodilator
  solution.(2) Provocation process: Prepare 10 solutions of MCh provocant with gradually
  increasing concentrations.(3) Operational procedure: The oscillation frequency is
  usually set to 3 Hz (7 Hz for children) during the test. The subject breathes calmly,
  inhales saline solution nebulized first, and records the baseline resistance value
  (if the subject's baseline resistance value is higher than 10 cmH2O L-1 s-1, the
  challenge test should not be performed). Then, the subject gradually inhales increasing
  concentrations of methacholine solution. Each concentration solution is inhaled
  for 1 minute, and the nebulization system automatically switches to the next concentration
  for inhalation according to the set time. Each nebulizer cup contains 2-3 ml of
  solution, the output is 0.15 ml/min, and each concentration is inhaled for 1 minute.
  The dose-response curve is recorded automatically. Subjects should breathe tidally
  during the test, avoiding deep breaths and swallowing. Continue until Rrs significantly
  rises to more than double the baseline value, or if the subject experiences notable
  respiratory symptoms or other discomfort, such as wheezing in both lungs upon auscultation.
  At this point, the inhalation of the provocant should be stopped and the subject
  switchs to inhaling a bronchodilator until Rrs returns to pre-provocation levels.
  If there is no significant increase in Rrs, stop the test after inhaling the highest
  concentration of MCh.Question 9: How to interpret the results of the MCT?The method
  chosen for the MCT determines the specific indicators used for interpretation. The
  most commonly used indicator is FEV1, although other parameters such as Peak Expiratory
  Flow (PEF) and Rrs can also be used to assess airway hyperresponsiveness.Qualitative
  judgment: The test results can be classified as positive, suspiciously positive,
  or negative, based on a combination of the judgment indicators and changes in the
  subject's symptoms. If FEV1 decreases by>=20% compared to the baseline value after
  not completely inhaling at the highest concentration, the result can be judged as
  positive for Methacholine bronchial challenge test. If the patient has obvious wheezing
  symptoms or wheezing is heard in both lungs, but the challenge test does not meet
  the positive criteria (the highest dose/concentration has been inhaled), and FEV1
  decreases between 10% and 20% compared to the baseline level, the result can also
  be judged as positive. If FEV1 decreases between 15% and 20% compared to the baseline
  value without dyspnea or wheezing attacks, the result can be judged as suspiciously
  positive. Astograph method: If Rrs rises to 2 times or more of the baseline resistance
  before reaching the highest inhalation concentration, or if the subject's lungs
  have wheezing and severe coughing, the challenge test can be judged as positive.
  Regardless of the result of the Methacholine bronchial challenge test, factors that
  affect airway reactivity, such as drugs, seasons, climate, diurnal variations, and
  respiratory tract infections, should be excluded.Quantitative judgment: When using
  the APS method, the severity of airway hyperresponsiveness can be graded based on
  PD20-FEV1 or PC20-FEV1. Existing evidence suggests that PD20 shows good consistency
  when different nebulizers, inhalation times, and starting concentrations of MCh
  are used for bronchial provocation tests, whereas there is more variability with
  PC20. Therefore, PD20 is often recommended as the quantitative assessment indicator.
  The threshold value for PD20 with the APS method is 2.5 mg.The Astograph method
  often uses the minimum cumulative dose (Dmin value, in Units) to reflect airway
  sensitivity. Dmin is the minimum cumulative dose of MCh required to produce a linear
  increase in Rrs. A dose of 1 g/L of the drug concentration inhaled for 1-minute
  equals 1 unit. It's important to note that with the continuous increase in inhaled
  provocant concentration, the concept of cumulative dose in the Astograph method
  should not be directly compared to other methods. Most asthma patients have a Dmin<10
  Units, according to Japanese guidelines. The Astograph method, having been used
  in China for over twenty years, suggests a high likelihood of asthma when Dmin<=6
  Units, with a smaller Dmin value indicating a higher probability. When Dmin is between
  6 and 10 Units, further differential diagnosis is advised to ascertain whether the
  condition is asthma.Precautions:A negative methacholine challenge test (MCT) does
  not entirely rule out asthma. The test may yield negative results due to the following
  reasons:(1) Prior use of medications that reduce airway responsiveness, such as
  beta2 agonists, anticholinergic drugs, antihistamines, leukotriene receptor antagonists,
  theophylline, corticosteroids, etc., and insufficient washout time.(2) Failure to
  meet quality control standards in terms of pressure, flow rate, particle size, and
  nebulization volume of the aerosol delivery device.(3) Poor subject cooperation
  leads to inadequate inhalation of the methacholine agent.(4) Some exercise-induced
  asthma patients may not be sensitive to direct bronchial challenge tests like the
  Methacholine challenge and require indirect bronchial challenge tests such as hyperventilation,
  cold air, or exercise challenge to induce a positive response.(5) A few cases of
  occupational asthma may only react to specific antigens or sensitizing agents, requiring
  specific allergen exposure to elicit a positive response.A positive MCT does not
  necessarily indicate asthma. Other conditions can also present with airway hyperresponsiveness
  and yield positive results in the challenge test, such as allergic rhinitis, chronic
  bronchitis, viral upper respiratory infections, allergic alveolitis, tropical eosinophilia,
  cystic fibrosis, sarcoidosis, bronchiectasis, acute respiratory distress syndrome,
  post-cardiopulmonary transplant, congestive heart failure, and more. Furthermore,
  factors like smoking, air pollution, or exercise before the test may also result
  in a positive bronchial challenge test.Question 10: What are the standardized requirements
  for the MCT report?The report should include: (1) basic information about the subject;
  (2) examination data and graphics: present baseline data, measurement data after
  the last two challenge doses or concentrations in tabular form, and the percentage
  of actual measured values compared to the baseline; flow-volume curve and volume-time
  curve before and after challenge test; dose-response curve: showing the threshold
  for positive challenge; (3) opinions and conclusions of the report: including the
  operator's opinions, quality rating of the examination, and review opinions of the
  reviewing physician.Question 11: What are the adverse reactions and safety measures
  of MCT?During the MCT, the subject needs to repeatedly breathe forcefully and inhale
  bronchial challenge agents, which may induce or exacerbate bronchospasm and contraction
  and may even cause life-threatening situations. Medical staff should be fully aware
  of the indications, contraindications, medication use procedures, and emergency
  response plans for the MCT."
