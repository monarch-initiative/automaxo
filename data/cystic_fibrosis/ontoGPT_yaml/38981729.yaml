input_text: Gene therapy - once just a dream, now a reality. Gene therapy is gradually
  becoming a mainstream treatment modality and is no longer the preserve of large
  university departments whose laboratories master nucleic acid analytical procedures
  and whose clinical teams manage its administration. It was originally designed for
  genetic diseases that, because of their prevalence, were a group known as rare diseases.
  Gene therapy has so far been applied in children to act before the disease development.
  These new treatments have also begun to be applied for common diseases such as metabolic
  disorders (e. g. diabetes) and even for those that are increasingly affecting us,
  such as various malignancies and diseases of the central nervous system (e. g. Alzheimer's
  disease). The targets targeted by GT are genes, where pathogenic alterations in
  the form of pathogenic variants (formerly mutations) induce phenotypic disorders,
  and our aim is either to knock them out of function (e. g. haemoglobinopathies)
  or to replace them with genes with normal function, which we introduce into the
  genome using one of the appropriate vectors, such as viruses or liposomes. The process
  of GT can take place directly inside the patient's body (in vivo) or outside the
  body on isolated cells (ex vivo), which are usually stem cells (iPSCs, induced pluripotent
  stem cell). After treatment, these cells are returned to the patient's body to fulfil
  their "destiny". In a broader sense, GT can target the product of gene transcription,
  which is the messenger RNA, or the end product of gene function, such as functional
  proteins (eg. cystic fibrosis). Any of these approaches have been used successfully
  in various diseases, depending on their availability, which is determined, among
  other things, by the costs associated with GT or the accessibility of the target
  tissue. Ultimately, it is not only the validation of the efficacy and safety of
  GT, but also economic reasons that determine why GT has been slow to develop and
  is mostly undertaken only by large and wealthy institutions. Another decisive factor
  is that from initial experimental work through clinical trials, the whole process
  of its development normally takes up to a decade.
