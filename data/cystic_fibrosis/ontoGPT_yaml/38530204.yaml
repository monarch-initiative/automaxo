input_text: 'Dual and triple modulator therapy for chronic rhinosinusitis in cystic
  fibrosis patients. BACKGROUND: The introduction of CFTR modulators has changed the
  landscape in the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) and early case series have shown
  improvements in sinonasal outcomes in this patient population. METHODOLOGY: A real-word
  data study was performed to evaluate the impact of dual therapy with tezacaftor/ivacaftor
  (TEZ/IVA) and triple therapy with elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ELX/TEZ/IVA)
  on CF-related chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), by comparing subjective and objective
  outcome measures at baseline, 12 months after treatment with TEZ/IVA and six months
  after treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA. RESULTS: In total, 43 CF patients, with a mean
  age of 32 years, were included. After triple therapy, significant improvements in
  overall visual analogue scale, SNOT-22, Lund Kennedy, nasal polyps, and Lund-Mackay
  scores were observed, whereas no beneficial effect could be seen in patients treated
  with dual therapy. Bacterial upper airway colonization did not differ pre- and postmodulator
  therapy in the present study. The number of responders to dual and triple therapy
  is 23.8% and 63.2% of the patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Triple therapy with
  ELX/TEZ/IVA is superior to dual therapy with TEZ/IVA in the treatment of CF-CRS,
  as significantly reduced sinonasal complaints, nasal endoscopy and CT scores were
  observed after triple therapy, whereas this was not the case for dual therapy.'
