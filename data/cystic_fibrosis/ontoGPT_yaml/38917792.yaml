input_text: 'Neutralizing antibodies after nebulized phage therapy in cystic fibrosis
  patients. BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis (CF) patients are prone to recurrent multi-drug-resistant
  (MDR) bacterial lung infections. Under this scenario, phage therapy has been proposed
  as a promising tool. However, the limited number of reported cases hampers the understanding
  of clinical outcomes. Anti-phage immune responses have often been overlooked and
  only described following invasive routes of administration. METHODS: Three monophage
  treatments against Staphylococcus aureus and/or Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infections
  were conducted in cystic fibrosis patients. In-house phage preparations were nebulized
  over 10 days with standard-of-care antibiotics. Clinical indicators, bacterial counts,
  phage and antibiotic susceptibility, phage detection, and immune responses were
  monitored. FINDINGS: Bacterial load was reduced by 3-6 log in two of the treatments.
  No adverse events were described. Phages remained in sputum up to 33 days after
  completion of the treatment. In all cases, phage-neutralizing antibodies were detected
  in serum from 10 to 42 days post treatment, with this being the first report of
  anti-phage antibodies after nebulized therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Nebulized phage therapy
  reduced bacterial load, improving quality of life even without bacterial eradication.
  The emergence of antibodies emphasizes the importance of long-term monitoring to
  better understand clinical outcomes. These findings encourage the use of personalized
  monophage therapies in contrast to ready-to-use cocktails, which might induce undesirable
  antibody generation. FUNDING: This study was supported by the Spanish Ministry of
  Science, Innovation and Universities; Generalitat Valenciana; and a crowdfunding
  in collaboration with the Spanish Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.'
