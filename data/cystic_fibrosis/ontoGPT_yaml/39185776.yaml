input_text: '[Self-care capacity of adult cystic fibrosis patients during transition/transfer
  between services]. BACKGROUND: To analyze the knowledge, abilities, and emotional
  state of cystic fibrosis patients during a specific follow-up period and compare
  this with the recall they had of the transition (planned and gradual shift from
  the pediatric unit) / transfer (direct change skipping the steps recommended by
  the guidelines) to a specialized cystic fibrosis adult unit. METHODS: Prospective
  cross-sectional study with cystic fibrosis adult patients under follow-up in a specialist
  consultation. Group 1 were patients who transitioned and Group 2 were transferred
  patients. The following information was collected: sociodemographic variables, degree
  of knowledge, skills, and emotional state using a survey designed for this purpose
  (as part of the internal consistency validation process). Participants also completed
  the emotional subscale of Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised. Inter-group comparisons
  were made for the transition/transfer, at the follow-up, and during the evolution.
  RESULTS: Thirty-five patients were analyzed; 65.8% male; mean age 31.9 years (SD
  =10.1). At the transition, Group 1 (n=19; 54.3%) had greater knowledge about their
  medication and reduced ability to manage appointments and making decisions in comparison
  to Group 2 at transfer. At follow-up, Group 1 made a better report on their emotional
  state and significantly improved their ability to manage appointments, communication,
  and decision-making. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who were moved to an adult cystic fibrosis
  unit through transition were more knowledgeable about their medications. However,
  those who were transferred managed their appointments and decision-making better,
  but felt sadder.'
