input_text: "Effect of antimetabolite regimen on cellular and humoral immune response
  to SARS-COV-2 vaccination in solid organ transplant recipients. OBJECTIVE: Novel
  mRNA-based vaccines have been proven to be powerful tools in combating the global
  pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 protecting individuals, especially the immunocompromised,
  from COVID-19. Still, it remains largely unknown how solid organ transplant and
  different immunosuppressive medications affect development of vaccine-induced immunity.
  METHODS: In this work, we monitored humoral and cellular memory responses after
  mRNA SARS-CoV-2 two-doses and booster doses vaccination in cystic fibrosis lung
  transplanted patients (CFT) and compared them with both cystic fibrosis patients
  without lung transplant (CF) and with kidney transplant recipients (KT). In particular,
  we investigated the effects of immunosuppressive regimens on immune memory to SARS-CoV-2
  after mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in transplanted patients. RESULTS: Our results showed
  that immunocompromised transplanted patients displayed a weak cellular and humoral
  memory to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination. In addition, obtained data clearly demonstrate
  that immunosuppressive therapy regimen including antimetabolites, further reduces
  patients' ability to respond to vaccination at both humoral and cell-mediated level.
  Notably, patient treated with antimetabolites showed a lower humoral and cellular
  response also after a booster dose vaccination. CONCLUSION: These results, even
  if obtained on a small patient's cohort, question whether immunocompromised patients
  need interventions to improve vaccine SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine response such as additional
  jab or modulation of immunosuppressive therapy."
