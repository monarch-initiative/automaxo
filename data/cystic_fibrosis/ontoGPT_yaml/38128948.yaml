  transplantation in paediatric cystic fibrosis: a single centre study.INTRODUCTION:
  Following lung transplantation, it is unknown how children/adolescents self-assess
  their performance in everyday activities, importance of these activities, and whether
  resumption of everyday activities influences self-reported quality of life. The
  aim was to examine the effect of bilateral lung transplantation on children's/adolescent's
  perception of engagement in everyday activities over the first 18 months post-transplant.
  METHODS: A multiple-single-case-study pre-post test design was conducted at a National
  Paediatric Lung Transplant Service. Participants were aged under 18 years and were
  3 months post first bilateral lung transplant at the time of recruitment. Outcomes
  were self-reported quality of life (Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL),
  Transplant Module and engagement in meaningful life roles (Child Occupational Self-Assessment
  (COSA) Scale) measured at 3 months and 18 months post-transplant from participants,
  and their parent(s) (PedsQL). Analysis included paired between-time differences
  and descriptive analysis. RESULTS: Seven participants were recruited to the trial
  with a mean age of 13 (SD 4) years and a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. The total
  mean scores on PedsQL remained stable between 3 months and 18 months for both participants
  and parents. The PedsQL transplant module total mean scores of participants significantly
  increased from 3 months (M=66.58, SD=11.83) to 18 months (M=80.25, SD=11.56), t(5)
  = 2.91, p=0.03 whereas parents' scores remained stable. COSA responses reported
  'big problems' with self-care tasks, family engagement and coping with worries at
  3 months. At 18 months, the 'big problem' activities shifted to community engagement
  and independence. CONCLUSION: Time influences self-reported quality of life and
  engagement in meaningful life roles for children/adolescents and their parents 3
  months to 18 months post-lung transplant. Our findings highlight the importance
  of focusing on occupational roles and occupational performance of children and adolescents
  when designing post-transplant interventions, suggesting a key role for occupational
  therapy after transplantation."
