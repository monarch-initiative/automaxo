input_text: 'Pharmacokinetics of polymyxin B in different populations: a systematic
  review. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Despite being clinically utilized for the treatment
  of infections, the limited therapeutic range of polymyxin B (PMB), along with considerable
  interpatient variability in its pharmacokinetics and frequent occurrence of acute
  kidney injury, has significantly hindered its widespread utilization. Recent research
  on the population pharmacokinetics of PMB has provided valuable insights. This study
  aims to review relevant literature to establish a theoretical foundation for individualized
  clinical management. METHODS: Follow PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
  Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, Pop-PK studies of PMB were searched in PubMed
  and EMBASE database systems from the inception of the database until March 2023.
  RESULT: To date, a total of 22 population-based studies have been conducted, encompassing
  756 subjects across six different countries. The recruited population in these studies
  consisted of critically infected individuals with multidrug-resistant bacteria,
  patients with varying renal functions, those with cystic fibrosis, kidney or lung
  transplant recipients, patients undergoing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)
  or continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), as well as individuals with obesity
  or pediatric populations. Among these studies, seven employed a one-compartmental
  model, with the range of typical clearance (CL) and volume (Vc) being 1.18-2.5L
  /h and 12.09-47.2 L, respectively. Fifteen studies employed a two-compartmental
  model, with the ranges of the clearance (CL) and volume of the central compartment
  (Vc), the volume of the peripheral compartment (Vp), and the intercompartment clearance
  (Q) were 1.27-8.65 L/h, 5.47-38.6 L, 4.52-174.69 L, and 1.34-24.3 L/h, respectively.
  Primary covariates identified in these studies included creatinine clearance and
  body weight, while other covariates considered were CRRT, albumin, age, and SOFA
  scores. Internal evaluation was conducted in 19 studies, with only one study being
  externally validated using an independent external dataset. CONCLUSION: We conclude
  that small sample sizes, lack of multicentre collaboration, and patient homogeneity
  are the primary reasons for the discrepancies in the results of the current studies.
  In addition, most of the studies limited in the internal evaluation, which confined
  the implementation of model-informed precision dosing strategies.'
