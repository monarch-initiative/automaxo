input_text: A new era of targeting cystic fibrosis with non-viral delivery of genomic
  medicines. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a complex genetic respiratory disorder that necessitates
  innovative gene delivery strategies to address the mutations in the gene. This review
  delves into the promises and challenges of non-viral gene delivery for CF therapy
  and explores strategies to overcome these hurdles. Several emerging technologies
  and nucleic acid cargos for CF gene therapy are discussed. Novel formulation approaches
  including lipid and polymeric nanoparticles promise enhanced delivery through the
  CF mucus barrier, augmenting the potential of non-viral strategies. Additionally,
  safety considerations and regulatory perspectives play a crucial role in navigating
  the path toward clinical translation of gene therapy.
