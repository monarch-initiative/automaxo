input_text: 'Safety and Tolerability of Bronchoscopic and Nebulised Administration
  of Bacteriophage. INTRODUCTION: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an organism well known
  for causing significant morbidity and mortality in people living with chronic lung
  conditions such as cystic fibrosis. We describe the safety, tolerability, and potential
  efficacy of bronchoscopic and nebulised bacteriophage administration, offering insights
  into a potential breakthrough for the treatment of chronic infections particularly
  in children and adolescents. METHOD: A 12-year-old female (F12) and a 17-year-old
  male (M17), both diagnosed with cystic fibrosis and chronic P. aeruginosa lung infection,
  underwent bacteriophage treatment (BT). The administration involved bronchoscopic
  instillation and subsequent nebulisation. This was performed concurrently with intravenous
  antibiotics and regular physiotherapy delivered in an in-patient setting for 14
  days. Microbiological, clinical, and lung function assessments were conducted to
  assess this treatment modality. RESULTS: No adverse events (fever, localised reaction,
  wheeze or bronchospasm) occurred during BT. F12 demonstrated a 4% increase, while
  M17 showed a 5% improvement in FEV1% from their best FEV1% over the past three years
  following BT. A 12% (F12) and an 8% (M17) improvement from baseline FEV1% was observed.
  For F12 P. aeruginosa was not isolated from her sputum despite 12 previous hospitalisations
  for intravenous antibiotics. CONCLUSION: Bronchoscopic and nebulised routes of bacteriophage
  administration were well-tolerated in these two adolescents. This early report underscores
  the potential of this treatment modality and encourages clinicians and researchers
  to actively explore this innovative approach.'
