input_text: Aerosol Inhalation of Gene Delivery Therapy for Pulmonary Diseases. Gene
  delivery therapy has emerged as a popular approach for the treatment of various
  diseases. However, it still poses the challenges of accumulation in target sites
  and reducing off-target effects. Aerosol gene delivery for the treatment of pulmonary
  diseases has the advantages of high lung accumulation, specific targeting and fewer
  systemic side effects. However, the key challenge is selecting the appropriate formulation
  for aerosol gene delivery that can overcome physiological barriers. There are numerous
  existing gene carriers under study, including viral vectors and non-viral vectors.
  With the development of biomaterials, more biocompatible substances have applied
  gene delivery via inhalation. Furthermore, many types of genes can be delivered
  through aerosol inhalation, such as DNA, mRNA, siRNA and CRISPR/Cas9. Aerosol delivery
  of different types of genes has proven to be efficient in the treatment of many
  diseases such as SARS-CoV-2, cystic fibrosis and lung cancer. In this paper, we
  provide a comprehensive review of the ongoing research on aerosol gene delivery
  therapy, including the basic respiratory system, different types of gene carriers,
  different types of carried genes and clinical applications.
