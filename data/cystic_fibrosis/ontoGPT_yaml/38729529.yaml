input_text: 'Inhaled antibiotics: A promising drug delivery strategies for efficient
  treatment of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) associated with antibiotic
  resistant biofilm-dwelling and intracellular bacterial pathogens. Antibiotic-resistant
  bacteria associated with LRTIs are frequently associated with inefficient treatment
  outcomes. Antibiotic-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae,
  Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus, infections are strongly associated
  with pulmonary exacerbations and require frequent hospital admissions, usually following
  failed management in the community. These bacteria are difficult to treat as they
  demonstrate multiple adaptational mechanisms including biofilm formation to resist
  antibiotic threats. Currently, many patients with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis
  (CF), non-CF bronchiectasis (NCFB) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
  experience exacerbations of their lung disease and require high doses of systemically
  administered antibiotics to achieve meaningful clinical effects, but even with high
  systemic doses penetration of antibiotic into the site of infection within the lung
  is suboptimal. Pulmonary drug delivery technology that reliably deliver antibacterials
  directly into the infected cells of the lungs and penetrate bacterial biofilms to
  provide therapeutic doses with a greatly reduced risk of systemic adverse effects.
  Inhaled liposomal-packaged antibiotic with biofilm-dissolving drugs offer the opportunity
  for targeted, and highly effective antibacterial therapeutics in the lungs. Although
  the challenges with development of some inhaled antibiotics and their clinicals
  trials have been studied; however, only few inhaled products are available on market.
  This review addresses the current treatment challenges of antibiotic-resistant bacteria
  in the lung with some clinical outcomes and provides future directions with innovative
  ideas on new inhaled formulations and delivery technology that promise enhanced
  killing of antibiotic-resistant biofilm-dwelling bacteria.'
