input_text: Impact of interruption of CFTR modulator therapies. Novel drug therapy
  targeting the defective cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein
  has the potential to significantly enhance the quality of life for numerous patients
  with cystic fibrosis. However, in some countries social insurance does not pay for
  modulators because these drugs are extremely expensive. This study sought to understand
  the impact on the health of children whose modulator treatments were interrupted
  because of legal procedures and delivery processes. Our study identified that the
  significant increase in percent-predicted forced expiratory volume levels (FEV1)
  and BMI z-score values associated with modulator therapies decreased sharply with
  their discontinuation. Significant worsening in FEV1, BMI z-scores, and BW z-scores
  were detected in the first follow-up visit after therapy discontinuation within
  1 month. Eight patients had a reduction of FEV1 of more than 10%. The findings suggest
  that modulatory treatment continuation is important, and it is crucial that treatment
  is not interrupted.
