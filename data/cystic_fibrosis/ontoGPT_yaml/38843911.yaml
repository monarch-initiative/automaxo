input_text: ERS statement on transition of care in childhood interstitial lung diseases.
  Interstitial lung diseases (ILD) are a heterogeneous group of rare diffuse diseases
  affecting the lung parenchyma in children and adults. Childhood interstitial lung
  diseases (chILD) are often diagnosed at very young age, affect the developing lung,
  and can have different presentations and prognosis compared to adult forms of these
  diseases. Also, chILD in many cases may apparently remit, and have a better response
  to therapy and better prognosis than adult ILD. Many affected children will reach
  adulthood with minimal activity or clinical remission of the disease. They need
  continuing care and follow-up from childhood to adulthood if the disease persists
  and progresses over time but also if they are asymptomatic and in full remission.
  Therefore, for every chILD patient an active transition process from paediatric
  to adult care should be guaranteed. This ERS statement provides a review of the
  literature and current practice concerning transition of care in chILD. It draws
  on work in existing transition care programs in other chronic respiratory diseases,
  disease-overarching transition of care programs, evidence on the impact of these
  programs on clinical outcomes, current evidence regarding long-term remission of
  chILD as well as the lack of harmonisation between the current adult ILD and chILD
  classifications impacting on transition of care. While the transition system is
  well established in several chronic diseases, such as cystic fibrosis or diabetes
  mellitus, we could not find sufficient published evidence on transition systems
  in chILD. This statement summarises current knowledge but cannot yet provide evidence-based
  recommendations for clinical practice.
