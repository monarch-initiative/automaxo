input_text: Functional Consequences of CFTR Interactions in Cystic Fibrosis. Cystic
  fibrosis (CF) is a fatal autosomal recessive disorder caused by the loss of function
  mutations within a single gene for the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance
  Regulator (CFTR). CFTR is a chloride channel that regulates ion and fluid transport
  across various epithelia. The discovery of CFTR as the CF gene and its cloning in
  1989, coupled with extensive research that went into the understanding of the underlying
  biological mechanisms of CF, have led to the development of revolutionary therapies
  in CF that we see today. The highly effective modulator therapies have increased
  the survival rates of CF patients and shifted the epidemiological landscape and
  disease prognosis. However, the differential effect of modulators among CF patients
  and the presence of non-responders and ineligible patients underscore the need to
  develop specialized and customized therapies for a significant number of patients.
  Recent advances in the understanding of the CFTR structure, its expression, and
  defined cellular compositions will aid in developing more precise therapies. As
  the lifespan of CF patients continues to increase, it is becoming critical to clinically
  address the extra-pulmonary manifestations of CF disease to improve the quality
  of life of the patients. In-depth analysis of the molecular signature of different
  CF organs at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels is rapidly advancing
  and will help address the etiological causes and variability of CF among patients
  and develop precision medicine in CF. In this review, we will provide an overview
  of CF disease, leading to the discovery and characterization of CFTR and the development
  of CFTR modulators. The later sections of the review will delve into the key findings
  derived from single-molecule and single-cell-level analyses of CFTR, followed by
  an exploration of disease-relevant protein complexes of CFTR that may ultimately
  define the etiological course of CF disease.
