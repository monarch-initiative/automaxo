input_text: Viral airway injury promotes cell engraftment in an in vitro model of
  cystic fibrosis cell therapy.Cell therapy is a potential treatment for cystic fibrosis
  (CF). However, cell engraftment into the airway epithelium is challenging. Here,
  we model cell engraftment in vitro using the air-liquid interface (ALI) culture
  system by injuring well-differentiated CF ALI cultures and delivering non-CF cells
  at the time of peak injury. Engraftment efficiency was quantified by measuring chimerism
  by droplet digital PCR and functional ion transport in Ussing chambers. Using this
  model, we found that human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) engraft more efficiently
  when they are cultured by conditionally reprogrammed cell (CRC) culture methods.
  Cell engraftment into the airway epithelium requires airway injury, but the extent
  of injury needed is unknown. We compared three injury models and determined that
  severe injury with partial epithelial denudation facilitates long-term cell engraftment
  and functional CFTR recovery up to 20% of wildtype function. The airway epithelium
  promptly regenerates in response to injury, creating competition for space and posing
  a barrier to effective engraftment. We examined competition dynamics by time-lapse
  confocal imaging and found that delivered cells accelerate airway regeneration by
  incorporating into the epithelium. Irradiating the repairing epithelium granted
  engrafting cells a competitive advantage by diminishing resident stem cell proliferation.
  Intentionally, causing severe injury to the lungs of people with CF would be dangerous.
  However, naturally occurring events like viral infection can induce similar epithelial
  damage with patches of denuded epithelium. We found that viral preconditioning promoted
  effective engraftment of cells primed for viral resistance.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Cell

  engraftment required severe epithelial injury. Intentionally injuring the lungs
  to this extent would be dangerous. However, naturally occurring events like viral
  infection induce similar epithelial damage. We found that viral preconditioning
  promoted the engraftment of cells primed for viral resistance leading to CFTR functional
  recovery to 20% of the wildtype.
