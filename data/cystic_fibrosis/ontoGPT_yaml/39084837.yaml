input_text: New Therapies in Outpatient Pulmonary Medicine. Newer medications and
  devices, as well as greater understanding of the benefits and limitations of existing
  treatments, have led to expanded treatment options for patients with lung disease.
  Treatment advances have led to improved outcomes for patients with asthma, chronic
  obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, pulmonary hypertension,
  and cystic fibrosis. The risks and benefits of available treatments are substantially
  variable within these heterogeneous disease groups. Defining the role of newer therapies
  mandates both an understanding of these disorders and overall treatment approaches.
  This section will review general treatment approaches in addition to focusing on
  newer therapies for these conditions..

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  primary_disease: <The main disease the text is about, or its central disease topic. This is often the disease mentioned in an article's title or in its first few sentences.>
  medical_actions: <Semicolon-separated list of medical actions, where each is a clinically prescribed procedure, therapy, intervention, or recommendation.>
  symptoms: <Semicolon-separated list of signs or symptoms.>
  chemicals: <Semicolon-separated list of chemicals or drugs>
  action_annotation_relationships: <Semicolon-separated list of relationships between a disease, the mentioned signs and symptoms associated with that disease, the medical actions relating to each symptom, and the type of relationship between each action and symptom (usually TREATS or PREVENTS). The disease name must be included in the relationship, for example, "treatment TREATS symptom IN disease". If the medical action includes a specific chemical or drug, include the chemical or drug name in the relationship, for example, "treatment (with chemical) TREATS symptom IN disease".>
