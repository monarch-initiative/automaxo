input_text: New drugs, new challenges in cystic fibrosis care. Cystic fibrosis (CF)
  is a genetic disease caused by variants in the gene encoding for the CF transmembrane
  conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, a chloride and bicarbonate channel. CFTR dysfunction
  results in a multiorgan disease with the main clinical features being exocrine pancreatic
  insufficiency and diffuse bronchiectasis with chronic airway infection leading to
  respiratory failure and premature death. Over the past decades, major progress has
  been made by implementing multidisciplinary care, including nutritional support,
  airway clearance techniques and antibiotics in specialised CF centres. The past
  decade has further seen the progressive development of oral medications, called
  CFTR modulators, for which around 80% of people with CF are genetically eligible
  in Europe. CFTR modulators partially restore ion transport and lead to a rapid and
  major improvement in clinical manifestations and lung function, presumably resulting
  in longer survival. CFTR modulators have been game-changing in the care of people
  with CF. However, many questions remain unanswered, such as the long-term effects
  of CFTR modulators, especially when treatment is started very early in life, or
  the new CF-related disease emerging due to CFTR modulators. Moreover, severe complications
  of CF, such as diabetes or cirrhosis, are not reversed on CFTR modulators and around
  20% of people with CF bear CFTR variants leading to a CFTR protein that is unresponsive
  to CFTR modulators. Challenges also arise in adapting CF care to a changing disease.
  In this review article, we highlight the new questions and challenges emerging from
  this revolution in CF care.
