input_text: 'Neutrophil serine proteases in cystic fibrosis: role in disease pathogenesis
  and rationale as a therapeutic target. Chronic airway inflammation is a central
  feature in the pathogenesis of bronchiectasis (BE), which can be caused by cystic
  fibrosis (CFBE; hereafter referred to as CF lung disease) and non-CF-related conditions
  (NCFBE). Inflammation in both CF lung disease and NCFBE is predominantly driven
  by neutrophils, which release proinflammatory cytokines and granule proteins, including
  neutrophil serine proteases (NSPs). NSPs include neutrophil elastase, proteinase
  3 and cathepsin G. An imbalance between NSPs and their antiproteases has been observed
  in people with CF lung disease and people with NCFBE. While the role of the protease/antiprotease
  imbalance is well established in both CF lung disease and NCFBE, effective therapies
  targeting NSPs are lacking. In recent years, the introduction of CF transmembrane
  conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator therapy has immensely improved outcomes in
  many people with CF (pwCF). Despite this, evidence suggests that airway inflammation
  persists, even in pwCF treated with CFTR modulator therapy. In this review, we summarise
  current data on neutrophilic inflammation in CF lung disease to assess whether neutrophilic
  inflammation and high, uncontrolled NSP levels play similar roles in CF lung disease
  and in NCFBE. We discuss similarities between the neutrophilic inflammatory profiles
  of people with CF lung disease and NCFBE, potentially supporting a similar therapeutic
  approach. Additionally, we present evidence suggesting that neutrophilic inflammation
  persists in pwCF treated with CFTR modulator therapy, at levels similar to those
  in people with NCFBE. Collectively, these findings highlight the ongoing need for
  new treatment strategies targeting neutrophilic inflammation in CF lung disease.'
