input_text: 'Using reference equations to standardise incremental shuttle walk test
  performance in children and young people with chronic conditions and facilitate
  the evaluation of exercise capacity and disease severity.AIMS: The aim was to evaluate
  whether standardised exercise performance during the incremental shuttle walk test
  (ISWT) can be used to assess disease severity in children and young people (CYP)
  with chronic conditions, through (1) identifying the most appropriate paediatric
  normative reference equation for the ISWT, (2) assessing how well CYP with haemophilia
  and cystic fibrosis (CF) perform against the values predicted by the best fit reference
  equation and (3) evaluating the association between standardised ISWT performance
  and disease severity. METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis was carried out using
  existing data from two independent studies (2018-2019) at paediatric hospitals in
  London,UK. CYP with haemophilia (n=35) and CF (n=134) aged 5-18 years were included.
  Published reference equations for standardising ISWT were evaluated through a comparison
  of populations, and Bland-Altman analysis was used to assess the level of agreement
  between distances predicted by each equation. Associations between ISWT and disease
  severity were assessed with linear regression. RESULTS: Three relevant reference
  equations were identified for the ISWT that standardised performance based on age,
  sex and body mass index (Vardhan, Lanza, Pinho). A systematic proportional bias
  of standardised ISWT was observed in all equations, most pronounced with Vardhan
  and Lanza; the male Pinho equation was identified as most appropriate. On average,
  CYP with CF and haemophilia performed worse than predicted by the Pihno equation,
  although the range was wide. Standardised ISWT, and not ISWT distance alone, was
  significantly associated with forced expiratory volume in 1 s in CYP with CF. Standardised
  ISWT in CYP with haemophilia was slightly associated with haemophilia joint health
  score, but this was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: ISWT performance may be useful
  in a clinic to identify those with worsening disease, but only when performance
  is standardised against a healthy reference population. The development of validated
  global reference equations is necessary for more robust assessment.'
