input_text: "Combined Liver-Pancreas Transplantation as Novel Treatment for Patient
  With Cystic Fibrosis: A Case Report. BACKGROUND: A 21-year-old woman diagnosed with
  cystic fibrosis developed cirrhosis, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, and insulin-dependent
  diabetes mellitus. The patient qualified for double organ liver-pancreas transplantation
  beyond typical indications. The respiratory symptoms of cystic fibrosis were moderate
  and well-treated. The patient was endangered mainly by liver insufficiency and recurrent
  hypoglycemia, which was due to the treatment of diabetes with high doses of insulin.
  Computed tomography showed mild bronchiectasis, cirrhotic liver, splenomegaly, and
  atrophy of the pancreas. Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonized the upper respiratory
  tract. Gastrointestinal complications were sufficient for the patient to be qualified
  for combined liver-pancreas transplantation. METHODS: First, a standard hepatectomy
  was performed. The liver was transplanted orthotopically. Subsequently, the team
  performed pancreas transplantation through a separate incision. The donor's duodenum
  was anastomosed to the recipient's jejunum, close to the ligament of Treitz. RESULTS:
  No serious complications were noted during the postoperative period. Transplanted
  organs started functioning without delay. The patient was discharged after 6 weeks
  in general good condition. Twenty months later, the patient felt well, and the grafts
  kept functioning properly. CONCLUSION: Combined liver-pancreas transplantation in
  patients with CF restores exocrine and endocrine pancreatic function and minimizes
  the risk of life-threatening complications associated with liver insufficiency.
  Improvement of life quality coincides with the possibility of discontinuing insulin
  and pancreatic enzyme supplementation. The combination of liver and pancreas transplantation
  may prevent advanced pulmonary complications, extend the prognosis of survival,
  and improve the long-term life quality."
