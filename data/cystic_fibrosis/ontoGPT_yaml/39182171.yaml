input_text: 'Kidney After Lung Transplants or Combined Kidney-Lung Transplantation:
  A Single-Center Retrospective Cohort Study. BACKGROUND End-stage renal disease is
  a major issue in the management of patients undergoing lung transplantation. Combined
  kidney-lung transplantation (CKLT) and kidney after lung transplantation (KALT)
  are the 2 preferred solutions to manage this situation. To evaluate these strategies,
  we describe kidney and lung graft outcomes and patient survival in patients managed
  with CKLT and KALT. MATERIAL AND METHODS We conducted a retrospective single-center
  cohort study. Patients who underwent a CKLT or a KALT were included in this study.
  Retrospective extraction of data from medical records was performed. RESULTS Seventeen
  patients underwent CKLT and 9 underwent KALT. Most of the patients had cystic fibrosis
  and presented renal failure related to anti-calcineurin toxicity. The 30-day and
  1-year survival of CKLT recipients were both 75.6%. No patients with KALT died during
  the follow-up. Kidney graft prognosis was almost exclusively influenced by patient
  survival in relation to postoperative lung transplant complications. The rate of
  severe surgical complications was close to 60% for CKLT compared with 30% for KALT.
  The kidney graft function (estimated kidney graft function) did not differ according
  to the transplantation strategy. CONCLUSIONS KALT is a safe option, with postoperative
  morbidity and renal graft function identical to those of kidney transplantation
  in non-lung-transplanted patients. The results of CKLT depend mainly on the morbidity
  associated with lung transplantation but remain an attractive option for patients
  with respiratory failure associated with end-stage renal disease. The choice of
  transplant strategy must also take into account the most ethical and efficient allocation
  of kidney grafts.'
