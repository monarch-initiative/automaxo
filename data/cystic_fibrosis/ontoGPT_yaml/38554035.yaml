input_text: 'Perceived burden of respiratory physiotherapy in people with cystic fibrosis
  taking elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor combination: a 1-year observational study.
  BACKGROUND: To limit the progression of disease, people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF)
  perform daily respiratory physiotherapy, which is perceived as the most burdensome
  routine in managing their condition. The elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor (ETI)
  combination has changed respiratory management. OBJECTIVE: To investigate how the
  perceived treatment burden changed in 1 year of treatment with ETI. DESIGN: Prospective
  observational study. METHODS: Ad hoc questionnaires for the pwCF and for the caregivers
  of pwCF < 18 years were administered before the initiation of ETI therapy and then
  at 6-12 months. The Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) and the Sinonasal
  Outcome Test (SNOT-22) were administered to explore disease-related symptoms and
  social limitations. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire was used to
  determine levels of physical activity. Mixed-effect models were fitted to explore
  whether the time engaged in respiratory physiotherapy changed during 1 year. RESULTS:
  The study included 47/184 pwCF aged 21.4 (5.7) years, who completed 1 year of ETI
  therapy. At 6 months, time on aerosol therapy was decreased by 2.5 (95% CI -32.9
  to 27.8) min/day, time on airway clearance therapies (ACTs) was decreased by 8.8
  (95% CI -25.9 to 8.3) min/day, and time for cleaning and disinfecting respiratory
  equipment was decreased by 10.6 (95% CI -26.5 to 5.3) min/day. At 1 year, gains
  in time saved were nearly 15 min/day on average. At 1 year, 5/47 (10.6%) pwCF reported
  that they had discontinued positive expiratory pressure mask. CONCLUSION: PwCF on
  ETI may note less time engaged in their daily respiratory physiotherapy routine.
  Nonetheless, aerosol therapy, ACTs and maintaining respiratory equipment were still
  perceived as time-consuming daily activities.'
