input_text: 'Pancreas and pancreatitis: Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Exocrine
  pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) is highly prevalent among individuals with cystic
  fibrosis (CF). Individuals diagnosed with EPI are often labeled as having "pancreas
  insufficient cystic fibrosis (PI-CF)" while those with normal exocrine function
  are labeled as "pancreas sufficient CF (PS-CF)." This diagnosis of EPI relies on
  clinical and laboratory features and management involves consumption of pancreas
  enzyme replacement therapy. In this review, we discuss the nuances of diagnosis
  and management of EPI in CF. We also present emerging evidence on the effects of
  CFTR modulating agents on the management of EPI, and speculate that these medications
  may lead to greater heterogeneity in management of EPI in CF moving forward.'
