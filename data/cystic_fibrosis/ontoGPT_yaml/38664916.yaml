input_text: Evolution of nutritional management in children with cystic fibrosis -
  a narrative review. Nutrition has played a central role in the management and outcomes
  of people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) since the 1970s. Advances in therapies and
  practices in recent decades have led to a significant change in the patient landscape
  with dramatic improvements in life expectancy, as well as quality of life, bringing
  with it new issues. Historically, cystic fibrosis was a condition associated with
  childhood and malnutrition; however, changes in patient demographics, nutritional
  assessment and fundamental nutritional management have evolved, and it has become
  an increasingly prevalent adult disease with new nutritional challenges, including
  obesity. This paper aims to describe these changes and the impact and challenges
  they bring for those working in this field. Nutritional professionals will need
  to evolve, adapt and remain agile to the wider range of situations and support required
  for a new generation of pwCF. Specialised nutrition support will continue to be
  required, and it will be additionally important to improve and optimise quality
  of life and long-term health.
