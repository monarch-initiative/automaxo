input_text: A First Experience of Distant Lung Preservation for Transplantation in
  the Russian Federation. Lung transplant is an effective method of treating patients
  with end-stage respiratory diseases, but problems such as the imbalance between
  the number of donor organs and the number ofrecipients needing organs still play
  a leading role. From a transplant point of view, a multiorgan donor is considered
  of greatest efficiency, so that all organs that can potentially be used should be
  transplanted. The combination of the vast geographical territory of Russia, the
  shortage of actual donors, and the relatively small number of transplant centers
  has led to the need to transport donor lungs by air over long distances. There were
  already precedents in the world for remote preservation of donor organs for transplant.
  In this study, we have described the unique experience of remote evaluation of donor
  lungs with their subsequent air transportation and transplantation, which is the
  first such description in Russia to our knowledge. The donor lungs for lung transplant
  were brought from medical institutions of the Samara region to Moscow. During remote
  evaluation, all information was transmitted to the transplant center by providing
  access to the automated information system "Organ Donation," which was used at that
  time by the service and contained all information about a potential donor in real
  time. The 2 transplant candidates had end-stage cystic fibrosis and severe respiratory
  failure; both patients underwent organ implantation from donors located outside
  their regions. In conditions of shortages of donor organs, long-distance transportation
  is a reasonable, feasible, and safe procedure.
