input_text: "Ceragenin-mediated disruption of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms.BACKGROUND:
  Microbial biofilms, as a hallmark of cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease and other
  chronic infections, remain a desirable target for antimicrobial therapy. These biopolymer-based
  viscoelastic structures protect pathogenic organisms from immune responses and antibiotics.
  Consequently, treatments directed at disrupting biofilms represent a promising strategy
  for combating biofilm-associated infections. In CF patients, the viscoelasticity
  of biofilms is determined mainly by their polymicrobial nature and species-specific
  traits, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa filamentous (Pf) bacteriophages. Therefore,
  we examined the impact of microbicidal ceragenins (CSAs) supported by mucolytic
  agents-DNase I and poly-aspartic acid (pASP), on the viability and viscoelasticity
  of mono- and bispecies biofilms formed by Pf-positive and Pf-negative P. aeruginosa
  strains co-cultured with Staphylococcus aureus or Candida albicans. METHODS: The
  in vitro antimicrobial activity of ceragenins against P. aeruginosa in mono- and
  dual-species cultures was assessed by determining minimum inhibitory concentration
  (MIC) and minimum bactericidal/fungicidal concentration (MBC/MFC). Inhibition of
  P. aeruginosa mono- and dual-species biofilms formation by ceragenins alone and
  in combination with DNase I or poly-aspartic acid (pASP) was estimated by the crystal
  violet assay. Additionally, the viability of the biofilms was measured by colony-forming
  unit (CFU) counting. Finally, the biofilms' viscoelastic properties characterized
  by shear storage (G') and loss moduli (G\"), were analyzed with a rotational rheometer.
  RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that ceragenin CSA-13 inhibits biofilm formation
  and increases its fluidity regardless of the Pf-profile and species composition;
  however, the Pf-positive biofilms are characterized by elevated viscosity and elasticity
  parameters. CONCLUSION: Due to its microbicidal and viscoelasticity-modifying properties,
  CSA-13 displays therapeutic potential in biofilm-associated infections, especially
  when combined with mucolytic agents."
