input_text: 'Investigations, management and outcome of neonates presenting with distal
  intestinal obstruction: challenging the need for contrast enemas. PURPOSE: To characterise
  the investigations, management and ultimate diagnosis of neonates with distal intestinal
  obstruction. METHODS: Retrospective review of term (> 37 weeks) neonates with admission
  diagnosis of distal intestinal obstruction over 10 years (2012-2022). Patient pathways
  were identified and associations between presentations, response to treatments and
  outcome investigated. RESULTS: A total of 124 neonates were identified and all included.
  Initial management was colonic irrigation in 108, contrast enema in 4, and laparotomy
  in 12. Of those responding to irrigations none underwent contrast enema. Ultimately,
  22 neonates proceeded to laparotomy. Overall, 106 had a suction rectal biopsy and
  41 had genetic testing for cystic fibrosis. Final diagnosis was Hirschsprung disease
  (HD) in 67, meconium ileus with cystic fibrosis (CF) in 9, meconium plug syndrome
  in 19 (including 3 with CF), intestinal atresia in 10 and no formal diagnosis in
  17. Median length of neonatal unit stay was 11 days (7-19). CONCLUSIONS: Initial
  management of neonates with distal bowel obstruction should be colonic irrigation
  since this is therapeutic in the majority and significantly reduces the need for
  contrast enema. These infants should all have suction rectal biopsy to investigate
  for HD unless another diagnosis is evident. If a meconium plug is passed, testing
  for CF is recommended. Evaluation and therapy are multimodal and time consuming,
  placing burden on resources and families.'
