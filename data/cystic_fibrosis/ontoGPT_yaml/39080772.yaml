input_text: 'Lung transplant list withdrawal in a liver transplant patient thanks
  to elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor: a case report. BACKGROUND: Elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor
  (ETI) is a transmembrane conductance regulator modulator that significantly improves
  lung function in patients affected by cystic fibrosis (CF). This triple drug is
  currently not indicated in liver transplant patients, as clinical trials including
  subjects with previous solid organ transplantation are lacking. CASE PRESENTATION:
  We report on a liver transplant girl with CF-related advanced pulmonary disease
  meeting clinical criteria for lung transplant, who started the triple modulator
  because she could not get on the lung transplant waiting list due to psycho-social
  motivations. Since initiation of ETI therapy, she has experienced a significant
  improvement in respiratory function and quality of life, without adverse effects.
  CONCLUSIONS: This case shows that ETI therapy can represent a lifesaving drug for
  individuals without alternatives, even in liver transplant patients. The clinical
  benefits of the modulator overcome risks, which may be limited with a close drug
  monitoring of immunosuppressants serum levels and functional liver tests.'
