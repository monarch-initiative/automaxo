input_text: "Exercise intolerance, oxidative stress, and irisin in pediatric cystic
  fibrosis: Can telehealth-based exercise training make a difference? BACKGROUND:
  Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) experience increased oxidative stress. Tele-exercise
  can be a new method to improve exercise in CF. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate
  the effect of telehealth-based exercise training using different modalities (combined
  exercise training group, CombG, core stabilization exercise group, SG), in comparison
  with control group (CG), on exercise capacity, oxidative stress, and irisin in children
  with CF. METHODS: Thirty-nine children with CF (mean age=11.41+-2.18 years, mean
  FEV1(z-score)=-0.66+-1.96) were included in the study. The children were randomly
  allocated to groups. The CombG and SG performed core stabilization exercises (CS)
  3 days per week for 8 weeks. The CombG also performed aerobic exercises 3 days per
  week in addition to CS. Physical activity (PA) recommendations were provided to
  the CG. Exercise capacity was evaluated using the Modified Shuttle Test (MST). Oxidative
  stress was assessed using total antioxidant status (TAS), total oxidant status (TOS),
  Oxidative Stress Index (OSI), malondialdehyde (MDA), and superoxide dismutase (SOD).
  The irisin level was also measured. RESULTS: Children's baseline sex, age, BMI,
  and FEV1 z-scores were similar (p > 0.05). The MST distance (p = 0.047,np2=0.157)
  and%MST distance (p = 0.045, np2=0.159) significantly improved in the CombG compared
  with the SG and CG. Although TAS and SOD decreased over time (p < 0.05), no significant
  changes were observed for TAS, TOS, OSI, MDA, SOD, and irisin parameters between
  the groups after training (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Combining aerobic exercise training
  with core stabilization applied using telehealth improved exercise capacity more
  than core stabilitation training only or PA recommendations in children with CF."
