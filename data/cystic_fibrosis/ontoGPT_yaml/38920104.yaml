input_text: 'Diagnosis and treatment of cystic fibrosis in India: What is at stake
  for developing countries? Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-threatening monogenic disease
  affecting thousands of people worldwide. Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance
  regulator (CFTR) is an ion channel that facilitates transportation of water and
  salts across epithelial cell membranes through the conductance of Cl- and other
  anions. A dysfunctional CFTR due to abnormalities in the cftr gene causes CF, which
  is believed to be a rare disease in India mainly due to mis/underdiagnosis. Although
  numerous diagnostic methods and treatment options are available for CF globally,
  most of these are unaffordable for developing countries like India. Currently, CF
  symptoms are managed with mucolytics, antibiotics, anti-inflammatory drugs, and
  various CFTR modulators based on the type of defect. While a definitive cure for
  CF remains elusive, advancements in stem cell and gene therapies hold promise for
  permanent cure in the near future. In this review, we discuss the prevalence of
  CF cases in India, affordable diagnostic methods, and treatment options amenable
  for developing countries. We further emphasize the scope for the universal newborn
  screening programme.'
