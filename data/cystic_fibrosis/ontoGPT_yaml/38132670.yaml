input_text: Phenotypes of a Pseudomonas aeruginosa hypermutator lineage that emerged
  during prolonged mechanical ventilation in a patient without cystic fibrosis.Hypermutator
  lineages of Pseudomonas aeruginosa arise frequently during the years of airway infection
  experienced by patients with cystic fibrosis and bronchiectasis but are rare in
  the absence of chronic infection and structural lung disease. Since the onset of
  the COVID-19 pandemic, large numbers of patients have remained mechanically ventilated
  for extended periods of time. These patients are prone to acquire bacterial pathogens
  that persist for many weeks and have the opportunity to evolve within the pulmonary
  environment. However, little is known about what types of adaptations occur in these
  bacteria and whether these adaptations mimic those observed in chronic infections.
  We describe a COVID-19 patient with a secondary P. aeruginosa lung infection in
  whom the causative bacterium persisted for >50 days. Over the course of this infection,
  a hypermutator lineage of P. aeruginosa emerged and co-existed with a non-hypermutator
  lineage. Compared to the parental lineage, the hypermutator lineage evolved to be
  less cytotoxic and less virulent. Genomic analyses of the hypermutator lineage identified
  numerous mutations, including in the mismatch repair gene mutL and other genes frequently
  mutated in individuals with cystic fibrosis. Together, these findings demonstrate
  that hypermutator lineages can emerge when P. aeruginosa persists following acute
  infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia and that these lineages have
  the potential to affect patient outcomes.IMPORTANCEPseudomonas aeruginosa may evolve
  to accumulate large numbers of mutations in the context of chronic infections such
  as those that occur in individuals with cystic fibrosis. However, these "hypermutator"
  lineages are rare following acute infections. Here, we describe a non-cystic fibrosis
  patient with COVID-19 pneumonia who remained mechanically ventilated for months.
  The patient became infected with a strain of P. aeruginosa that evolved to become
  a hypermutator. We demonstrate that hypermutation led to changes in cytotoxicity
  and virulence. These findings are important because they demonstrate that P. aeruginosa
  hypermutators can emerge following acute infections and that they have the potential
  to affect patient outcomes in this setting.
