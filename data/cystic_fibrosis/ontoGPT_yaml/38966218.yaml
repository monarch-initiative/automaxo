input_text: 'Efficacy of advanced hybrid closed loop systems in cystic fibrosis related
  diabetes: a pilot study. Background and aims: Cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD)
  is correlated with worsening of nutritional status and greater deterioration of
  lung function. The role of new technologies for the treatment of CFRD is little
  explored. The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of Advanced Hybrid Closed
  Loop (AHCL) systems on glycemic control in CF patients. Methods: A single-center
  retrospective study on CFRD patients using AHCL systems was performed. Glycated
  hemoglobin (HbA1c) values and Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) metrics were collected
  at T0 (AHCL placement), T1 (1-month), T2 (6-months) and T3 (1-year) to evaluate
  glycemic control. Results: 10 patients were included in the study. Data showed a
  reduction of HbA1c value (7.31 +- 0.34 to 6.35 +- 1.00; p=0.03), glycemic variability
  (p=0.05) and insulin requirement (p=0.03). The study population reached American
  Diabetes Association (ADA) recommended glycemic targets at 1-year. An increase in
  the Time in Range (TIR) and a reduction in time in hyperglycemia were also observed,
  although not statistically significant. Conclusions: In patients with CFRD, the
  use of AHCL leads to an improvement in glycemic control in terms of HbA1c and glycemic
  variability. The increase in TIR and the reduction of time in hyperglycemia, although
  not statistically significant, are extremely encouraging from a clinical point of
  view. Further studies with a larger population and a longer follow-up are needed.
  The results of this study demonstrate the importance of proposing the use of AHCL
  even in CF patients, who could benefit from glycemic improvement also in terms of
  nutritional status and respiratory function.'
