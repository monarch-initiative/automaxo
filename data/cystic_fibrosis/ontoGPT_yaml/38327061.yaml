input_text: "Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery for non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis
  in children.BACKGROUND: Pediatric bronchiectasis is a common respiratory disease
  in children. The use of video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) for its treatment
  remains controversial. OBJECTIVES: The objective of our study was to compare and
  analyze the clinical efficacy of thoracoscopic surgery and thoracotomy in the treatment
  of pediatric bronchiectasis and summarize the surgical treatment experience of VATS
  in children with bronchiectasis. DESIGN: Retrospective single-center cohort study.
  METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on the clinical data of 46 pediatric
  patients who underwent surgery with bronchiectasis at the Children's Hospital of
  Chongqing Medical University from May 2015 to May 2023. The patients were divided
  into two groups: the VATS group (25 cases) and the thoracotomy group (21 cases).
  Comparative analysis was performed on various parameters including basic clinical
  data, surgical methods, operation time, intraoperative blood loss, transfusion status,
  postoperative pain, postoperative mechanical ventilation time, chest tube drainage
  time, length of hospital stay, incidence of complications, and follow-up information.
  RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups
  of patients in terms of age, weight, gender, etiology, duration of symptoms, site
  of onset, and comorbidities (p > 0.05). The operation time in the VATS group was
  longer than that in the thoracotomy group (p < 0.001). However, the VATS group had
  better outcomes in terms of intraoperative blood loss, transfusion status, postoperative
  pain, postoperative mechanical ventilation time, chest tube drainage time, and length
  of hospital stay (p < 0.05). The incidence of postoperative complications in the
  VATS group was lower than that in the thoracotomy group, although the difference
  was not statistically significant (p = 0.152). Follow-up data showed no statistically
  significant difference in the surgical treatment outcomes between the two groups
  (p = 0.493). CONCLUSION: The incidence of complications and mortality in surgical
  treatment of bronchiectasis is acceptable. Compared with thoracotomy surgery, VATS
  has advantages such as smaller trauma, less pain, faster recovery, and fewer complications.
  For suitable pediatric patients with bronchiectasis, VATS is a safe and effective
  surgical method."
