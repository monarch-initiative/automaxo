input_text: 'Association of in-line digestive enzyme cartridge with enteral feeds
  on improvement in anthropometrics among pediatric patients with cystic fibrosis.
  BACKGROUND: Approximately 85% of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) have exocrine
  pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) with 10% requiring supplemental nighttime enteral
  tube feedings. Administration of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) with
  nighttime feedings is fraught with challenges. RELiZORB (Alcresta Therapeutics,
  Inc), an in-line lipase cartridge, delivers PERT continuously with enteral feedings.
  Outcomes related to the use of this in-line lipase cartridge are lesser known. This
  project evaluated anthropometrics related to in-line lipase cartridge use among
  pediatric patients with CF already receiving oral PERT therapy prior to nighttime
  enteral feedings. METHODS: Retrospective chart review was performed on 29 patients
  with CF and EPI receiving supplemental tube feedings and utilizing in-line lipase
  cartridge for a continuous 12 month period between 2015 and 2019. Anthropometrics
  were evaluated 12 months before and after initiation of in-line lipase cartridge.
  RESULTS: Compared with mean height z score at 6-months pre-in-line lipase cartridge,
  mean height z score at 6-months post-in-line-lipase cartridge (adjusted mean difference
  [AMD] = 0.2540; 95% CI = [0.0487, 0.4592]; P = 0.0153) and mean height z score at
  12-months post-in-line lipase cartridge (AMD = 0.2684; 95% CI = [0.0203, 0.5166];
  P = 0.0340) were significantly higher. Mean weight z score at 12-months post-in-line-lipase-cartridge
  neared statistical significance compared with 6-months pre-in-line lipase cartridge
  (AMD = 0.2816; 95% CI = [-0.0003, 0.5634]; P = 0.0502) when excluding seven patients
  with advanced lung disease (forced expiratory volume in the first second of expiration
  of 40%). Weight-for-length or body mass index did not significantly differ compared
  with pre-in-line lipase cartridge. CONCLUSION: Use of in-line lipase cartridge with
  enteral feeds improved anthropometrics, especially height, in pediatric patients
  with CF.'
