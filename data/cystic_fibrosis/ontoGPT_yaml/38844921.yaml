input_text: 'Systemic antibiotics for Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in outpatients
  with non-hospitalised exacerbations of pre-existing lung diseases: a randomised
  clinical trial. BACKGROUND: The effect of dual systemic antibiotic therapy against
  Pseudomonas aeruginosa in patients with pre-existing lung disease is unknown. To
  assess whether dual systemic antibiotics against P. aeruginosa in outpatients with
  COPD, non-cystic fibrosis (non-CF) bronchiectasis, or asthma can improve outcomes.
  METHODS: Multicenter, randomised, open-label trial conducted at seven respiratory
  outpatient clinics in Denmark. Outpatients with COPD, non-CF bronchiectasis, or
  asthma with a current P. aeruginosa-positive lower respiratory tract culture (clinical
  routine samples obtained based on symptoms of exacerbation not requiring hospitalisation),
  regardless of prior P. aeruginosa-status, no current need for hospitalisation, and
  at least two moderate or one hospitalisation-requiring exacerbation within the last
  year were eligible. Patients were assigned 1:1 to 14 days of dual systemic anti-pseudomonal
  antibiotics or no antibiotic treatment. Primary outcome was time to prednisolone
  or antibiotic-requiring exacerbation or death from day 20 to day 365. RESULTS: The
  trial was stopped prematurely based in lack of recruitment during the COVID-19 pandemic,
  this decision was endorsed by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board. Forty-nine outpatients
  were included in the study. There was a reduction in risk of the primary outcome
  in the antibiotic group compared to the control group (HR 0.51 (95%CI 0.27-0.96),
  p = 0.037). The incidence of admissions with exacerbation within one year was 1.1
  (95%CI 0.6-1.7) in the dual antibiotic group vs. 2.9 (95%CI 1.3-4.5) in the control
  group, p = 0.037. CONCLUSIONS: Use of dual systemic antibiotics for 14 days against
  P. aeruginosa in outpatients with chronic lung diseases and no judged need for hospitalisation,
  improved clinical outcomes markedly. The main limitation was the premature closure
  of the trial. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03262142, registration
  date 2017-08-25.'
