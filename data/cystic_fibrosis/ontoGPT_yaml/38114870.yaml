input_text: 'An overview of CFTR mutation profiles and assisted reproductive technology
  outcomes in Chinese patients with congenital obstructive azoospermia.PURPOSE: The
  cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is the most common causative
  gene attributed to congenital obstructive azoospermia (OA). The aim of this study
  was to conduct an epidemiological survey of congenital OA patients, to screen for
  CFTR mutations, and to follow their pregnancy outcomes in assisted reproductive
  technology (ART). METHODS: This cohort study enrolled congenital OA patients undergoing
  ART and whole-exome sequencing from January 2018 to September 2023. Semen parameters,
  sex hormones, and seminal plasma biochemistry were evaluated. CFTR mutations identified
  in OA patients were analyzed. In addition, the laboratory outcomes, clinical outcomes,
  and neonatal outcomes were compared between OA patients carrying two CFTR mutations
  and the others after surgical sperm extraction-intracytoplasmic sperm injection
  (ICSI) treatment. RESULTS: A total of 76 patients with congenital OA were enrolled.
  CFTR mutations were identified in 35 (46.1%) congenital OA patients. A total of
  60 CFTR mutation sites of 27 types were identified, and 10 of them were novel. The
  average frequency was 1.71 (60/35) per person. The most common mutation was c.1210-11T
  > G (25%, 15/60). After ICSI treatment, there were no statistically significant
  differences in laboratory outcomes, clinical outcomes, and neonatal outcomes between
  OA patients carrying two CFTR mutations (n = 25) and other OA patients (n = 51).
  CONCLUSION: Apart from the IVS9-5T mutation, the genetic mutation pattern of CFTR
  in Chinese OA patients is heterogeneous, which is significantly different from that
  of Caucasians. Although carrying two CFTR mutations or not had no effect on the
  pregnancy outcomes in OA patients after ICSI, genetic counseling is still recommended
  for such patients.'
