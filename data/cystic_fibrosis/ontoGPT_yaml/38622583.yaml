input_text: 'The effect of respiratory muscle training on children and adolescents
  with cystic fibrosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis. BACKGROUND: Cystic
  fibrosis is a chronic genetic disease that can affect the function of the respiratory
  system. Previous reviews of the effects of respiratory muscle training in people
  with cystic fibrosis are uncertain and do not consider the effect of age on disease
  progression. This systematic review aims to determine the effectiveness of respiratory
  muscle training in the clinical outcomes of children and adolescents with cystic
  fibrosis. METHODS: Up to July 2023, electronic databases and clinical trial registries
  were searched. Controlled clinical trials comparing respiratory muscle training
  with sham intervention or no intervention in children and adolescents with cystic
  fibrosis. The primary outcomes were respiratory muscle strength, respiratory muscle
  endurance, lung function, and cough. Secondary outcomes included exercise capacity,
  quality of life and adverse events. Two review authors independently extracted data
  and assessed study quality using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool 2. The certainty
  of the evidence was assessed according to the GRADE approach. Meta-analyses where
  possible; otherwise, take a qualitative approach. RESULTS: Six studies with a total
  of 151 participants met the inclusion criteria for this review. Two of the six included
  studies were published in abstract form only, limiting the available information.
  Four studies were parallel studies and two were cross-over designs. There were significant
  differences in the methods and quality of the methodology included in the studies.
  The pooled data showed no difference in respiratory muscle strength, lung function,
  and exercise capacity between the treatment and control groups. However, subgroup
  analyses suggest that inspiratory muscle training is beneficial in increasing maximal
  inspiratory pressure, and qualitative analyses suggest that respiratory muscle training
  may benefit respiratory muscle endurance without any adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS:
  This systematic review and meta-analysis indicate that although the level of evidence
  indicating the benefits of respiratory muscle training is low, its clinical significance
  suggests that we further study the methodological quality to determine the effectiveness
  of training. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The protocol for this review was recorded in the
  International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) under registration
  number CRD42023441829.'
