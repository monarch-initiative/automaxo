input_text: '[Adherence to chest physiotherapy in adults with cystic fibrosis]. INTRODUCTION:
  Chest-physiotherapy is a key element in treatment of cystic fibrosis and patient
  adherence is a major issue in global cystic fibrosis care. This study aims to assess
  adherence to chest physiotherapy in adults with cystic fibrosis who not treated
  with tritherapy and to analyze the impact of certain factors on adherence. METHODS:
  Thus is a cross-sectional study, conducted using a questionnaire and a physiotherapy
  evaluation. Adherence to this treatment was measured in terms of quantitative and
  qualitative aspects. The impact on adherence of 15 factors was then assessed. RESULTS:
  Only 47% of patients could be considered as adherent, with a significant disparity
  between a quantitative and qualitative assessment. Gender, working time, pathology
  severity, the fact of being regularly followed by a physiotherapist, the perceived
  benefit of the sessions and their replacement by physical activity, seem associated
  with adherence to this treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Taking into account the qualitative
  aspect of the sessions, our study reveals a low rate, in our cohort, of adherence
  to respiratory physiotherapy, and highlights six factors likely to predominate.
  Regular follow-up by a physiotherapist seems to be a determining factor in adherence
  to this treatment.'
