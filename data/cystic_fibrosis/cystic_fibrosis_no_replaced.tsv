38501330	A comparison of aminoglycoside antibiotic serum concentrations collected by peripheral veins and peripherally inserted central catheters in adults with cystic fibrosis.	BACKGROUND: People with cystic fibrosis (PwCF) are frequently hospitalized for treatment of pulmonary exacerbation. The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Pulmonary Guidelines support the use of intravenous aminoglycosides with therapeutic drug monitoring for the treatment of pulmonary exacerbation due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Serum intravenous tobramycin concentrations are commonly collected by peripheral venipuncture (PV). Discomfort associated with collection of samples by PV prompts collection via PICC, but the accuracy of intravenous tobramycin serum levels collected by PICC has not been documented in adult PwCF. The primary study objective was to evaluate the difference between intravenous tobramycin serum levels collected by PV and PICC in adult PwCF. METHODS: The authors conducted a prospective case-control study of adult PwCF admitted to University of Utah Health for a pulmonary exacerbation receiving tobramycin by a single lumen PICC. The authors compared tobramycin peak and random serum levels collected by PV and PICC using a detailed flush and waste protocol. RESULTS: The authors analyzed a total of 19 patients with peripheral and PICC samples. The mean tobramycin peak collected by PV (27.2 mcg/mL) was similar to the mean peak collected by PICC (26.9 mcg/mL) (paired samples Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p = .94). The correlation coefficient was 0.88 (95% CI = 0.85-0.91, p < .001). CONCLUSION: Tobramycin serum samples collected by PICC appear to be similar in value to PV collections. Collecting aminoglycoside levels by PICC rather than PV may reduce patient discomfort and improve quality of life. Additional multicenter studies are needed to confirm these results.

39257114	Influenza A (H1N1) in Hospitalized Children.	BACKGROUND: Influenza A (H1N1) is a contagious respiratory infection caused by the influenza A virus. In the majority of cases, H1N1 influenza is benign. However, it can be dangerous for infants and children with underlying chronic diseases. The severity of influenza depends on various factors, including the virulence of the virus strain, preexisting immunity level, and individual health conditions. The aim of this study is to describe the clinical profile of H1N1 influenza in hospitalized infants and children. METHODS: This is a prospective and descriptive study conducted from November 1, 2018, to January 31, 2024. In this study, we included all children under 14 years old hospitalized for suspected severe lower respiratory infection who had gone through virological testing. We used a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) kit: the Film Array-Respiratory Panel. Due to the depletion of multiplex PCR kits, this study continued using rapid influenza diagnostic tests based on immunochromatographic technique. RESULTS: We report 45 confirmed cases of H1N1 influenza, collected during the period from November 1, 2018, to January 31, 2024. The average age was 2 years and 4 months. The main reason for admission was respiratory distress found in all patients. In 53% of the cases, there was an associated comorbidity, including asthma (17 cases), prematurity (2 cases), congenital adrenal hyperplasia (2 cases), cystic fibrosis (1 case), undetermined etiology bronchial dilation (1 case), and Basedow's disease (1 case). The clinical presentation included viral bronchiolitis (17 cases), moderate asthma exacerbation (10 cases), severe asthma exacerbation (7 cases), pneumonia (9 cases), bronchial dilation exacerbation (1 case), and flu-like syndrome with adrenal insufficiency (1 case). Fever was present in 31 patients. Gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting were present in 20 cases. Three patients required intensive care, with 2 children being intubated and ventilated (one severe acute asthma and one severe viral bronchiolitis). Two cases were treated with oseltamivir. The average length of hospital stay was 7.5 days, ranging from 3 to 20 days. All cases showed favorable evolution. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that preventive measures remain crucial, and influenza vaccination is highly recommended in cases of underlying morbidity.
38644104	Attitudes to cross infection, nebuliser hygiene and antimicrobial resistance in people with cystic fibrosis: Results of an international survey.	BACKGROUND: Respiratory infection is a major cause of disease severity in people with cystic fibrosis (PwCF). This project aimed to establish the CF community's opinion regarding cross infection (CI), nebuliser hygiene, antimicrobial resistance, personal impact of microbiological findings and the role of the microbiology laboratory. METHODS: A questionnaire was completed anonymously (n = 280; PwCF (n = 128), parents (n = 123); friends/family/carers/charity personnel (n = 29)) from 13 countries. Readability scores (Flesch Reading Ease (FRE), Flesch Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL)) were determined for CI/IP&C information from six national CF charities and 21 scientific abstracts. RESULTS: Respondents (72.5%) indicated knowledge of laboratory aspects of CF microbiology was important, however implications of microbiological findings on personal health/well-being were of higher importance (p < 0.0001). Cross infection/infection prevention & control (CI/IP&C) was of highest importance (95.6% respondents) with 27.3% indicating they were not given adequate information, particularly in older respondents (50 y+) (p = 0.006) versus young adults (16-29 y) and respondents from the Middle East versus N. America (p = 0.022) and Europe (p = 0.045). Responses highlighted how CI/IP&C health literacy could be enhanced. Respondents (77.3%), particularly females (p < 0.0001), indicated they would increase the frequency of nebuliser disinfection following guidance on infection risks/best practice, therefore an educational video was prepared. CI/IP&C readability scores (mean +- sd) from CF charities (FRE 52.5 +- 10.8; FKGL 9.7 +- 2.3) were more readable (p < 0.0001) than scientific abstracts (FRE 13.3 +- 11.1; FKGL 16.9 +- 2.3), however not meeting the targets (FRE>=60 and FKGL<=8). CONCLUSION: There is a requirement for further CI/IP&C evidence-based guidance, policies/guidelines, education awareness, best practice in the home environment and multi-modal communication, enabling the CF community to make informed choices on lifestyle behaviours.
38876647	Effectiveness of manual therapy interventions in cystic fibrosis care: a pilot study.	BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a severe genetic condition that affects multiple organ systems and imposes a substantial treatment burden. Regarding the lungs and airways, the progressive pathophysiological changes place a significant strain on the musculoskeletal components of the respiratory system for people with CF. This pilot study investigated the effectiveness of manual therapy interventions (MTIs) on thoracic mobility, respiratory muscle strength, lung function, and musculoskeletal pain. METHOD: A study with a pretest-posttest design was conducted with 15 eligible people with CF at the Sahlgrenska University Hospital CF Centre. After an initial set of diagnostic tests at baseline, the participants underwent eight weekly 30-min MTIs. The MTIs included passive joint mobilisation and soft tissue manipulation of primary and secondary anatomical areas of the musculoskeletal respiratory system. On the day of the final intervention, the baseline measurements were repeated. RESULTS: Trends of increased thoracic mobility were observed following the intervention, with a statistically significant increase in respiratory muscle strength. No change in lung function was observed. Musculoskeletal pain before and after the intervention showed a significant decrease in tender points, and all participants reported positive experiences with MTIs. CONCLUSION: MTIs may improve thoracic mobility, alleviate pain, and enhance respiratory muscle strength in people with CF. Further research is needed to confirm their potential role as a CF physiotherapy supplement. CLINICAL TRIAL ID: NCT04696198.
39199292	Aerosol Inhalation of Gene Delivery Therapy for Pulmonary Diseases.	Gene delivery therapy has emerged as a popular approach for the treatment of various diseases. However, it still poses the challenges of accumulation in target sites and reducing off-target effects. Aerosol gene delivery for the treatment of pulmonary diseases has the advantages of high lung accumulation, specific targeting and fewer systemic side effects. However, the key challenge is selecting the appropriate formulation for aerosol gene delivery that can overcome physiological barriers. There are numerous existing gene carriers under study, including viral vectors and non-viral vectors. With the development of biomaterials, more biocompatible substances have applied gene delivery via inhalation. Furthermore, many types of genes can be delivered through aerosol inhalation, such as DNA, mRNA, siRNA and CRISPR/Cas9. Aerosol delivery of different types of genes has proven to be efficient in the treatment of many diseases such as SARS-CoV-2, cystic fibrosis and lung cancer. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the ongoing research on aerosol gene delivery therapy, including the basic respiratory system, different types of gene carriers, different types of carried genes and clinical applications.
39181163	Antibiotic-loaded nanoparticles for the treatment of intracellular methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Aureus infections: In vitro and in vivo efficacy of a novel antibiotic.	Antimicrobial resistance is considered one of the biggest threats to public health worldwide. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus is the causative agent of a number of infections and lung colonization in people suffering from cystic fibrosis. Moreover, a growing body of evidence links the microbiome to the development of cancer, as well as to the success of the treatment. In this view, the development of novel antibiotics is of critical importance, and SV7, a novel antibiotic active against MRSA at low concentrations, represents a promising candidate. However, the low aqueous solubility of SV7 hampers its therapeutic translation. In this study, SV7 was encapsulated in poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs) to improve the solubility profile, to ensure sustained release and eventually support deposition in the airways. Furthermore, PLGA NPs were formulated as dry powder to extend their shelf-life and were shown to efficiently target intracellular infections. After identifying a formulation with suitable physico-chemical characteristics, SV7-loaded NPs were investigated in vitro in terms of inhibitory activity against MRSA, and their safety profile in lung epithelial cells. Subsequently, the activity against MRSA intracellular infections was investigated in a co-culture model of MRSA and macrophages. To test the translatability of our findings, SV7-loaded NPs were tested in vivo in a Galleria mellonella infection model. In conclusion, SV7-loaded NPs showed a safe profile and efficient inhibitory activity against MRSA at low concentrations. Furthermore, their activity against intracellular infections was confirmed, and was retained in vivo, rendering them a promising candidate for treatment of MRSA lung infections.
38742326	A First Experience of Distant Lung Preservation for Transplantation in the Russian Federation.	Lung transplant is an effective method of treating patients with end-stage respiratory diseases, but problems such as the imbalance between the number of donor organs and the number ofrecipients needing organs still play a leading role. From a transplant point of view, a multiorgan donor is considered of greatest efficiency, so that all organs that can potentially be used should be transplanted. The combination of the vast geographical territory of Russia, the shortage of actual donors, and the relatively small number of transplant centers has led to the need to transport donor lungs by air over long distances. There were already precedents in the world for remote preservation of donor organs for transplant. In this study, we have described the unique experience of remote evaluation of donor lungs with their subsequent air transportation and transplantation, which is the first such description in Russia to our knowledge. The donor lungs for lung transplant were brought from medical institutions of the Samara region to Moscow. During remote evaluation, all information was transmitted to the transplant center by providing access to the automated information system "Organ Donation," which was used at that time by the service and contained all information about a potential donor in real time. The 2 transplant candidates had end-stage cystic fibrosis and severe respiratory failure; both patients underwent organ implantation from donors located outside their regions. In conditions of shortages of donor organs, long-distance transportation is a reasonable, feasible, and safe procedure.
38622583	The effect of respiratory muscle training on children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.	BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis is a chronic genetic disease that can affect the function of the respiratory system. Previous reviews of the effects of respiratory muscle training in people with cystic fibrosis are uncertain and do not consider the effect of age on disease progression. This systematic review aims to determine the effectiveness of respiratory muscle training in the clinical outcomes of children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis. METHODS: Up to July 2023, electronic databases and clinical trial registries were searched. Controlled clinical trials comparing respiratory muscle training with sham intervention or no intervention in children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis. The primary outcomes were respiratory muscle strength, respiratory muscle endurance, lung function, and cough. Secondary outcomes included exercise capacity, quality of life and adverse events. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool 2. The certainty of the evidence was assessed according to the GRADE approach. Meta-analyses where possible; otherwise, take a qualitative approach. RESULTS: Six studies with a total of 151 participants met the inclusion criteria for this review. Two of the six included studies were published in abstract form only, limiting the available information. Four studies were parallel studies and two were cross-over designs. There were significant differences in the methods and quality of the methodology included in the studies. The pooled data showed no difference in respiratory muscle strength, lung function, and exercise capacity between the treatment and control groups. However, subgroup analyses suggest that inspiratory muscle training is beneficial in increasing maximal inspiratory pressure, and qualitative analyses suggest that respiratory muscle training may benefit respiratory muscle endurance without any adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review and meta-analysis indicate that although the level of evidence indicating the benefits of respiratory muscle training is low, its clinical significance suggests that we further study the methodological quality to determine the effectiveness of training. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The protocol for this review was recorded in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) under registration number CRD42023441829.

38844921	Systemic antibiotics for Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in outpatients with non-hospitalised exacerbations of pre-existing lung diseases: a randomised clinical trial.	BACKGROUND: The effect of dual systemic antibiotic therapy against Pseudomonas aeruginosa in patients with pre-existing lung disease is unknown. To assess whether dual systemic antibiotics against P. aeruginosa in outpatients with COPD, non-cystic fibrosis (non-CF) bronchiectasis, or asthma can improve outcomes. METHODS: Multicenter, randomised, open-label trial conducted at seven respiratory outpatient clinics in Denmark. Outpatients with COPD, non-CF bronchiectasis, or asthma with a current P. aeruginosa-positive lower respiratory tract culture (clinical routine samples obtained based on symptoms of exacerbation not requiring hospitalisation), regardless of prior P. aeruginosa-status, no current need for hospitalisation, and at least two moderate or one hospitalisation-requiring exacerbation within the last year were eligible. Patients were assigned 1:1 to 14 days of dual systemic anti-pseudomonal antibiotics or no antibiotic treatment. Primary outcome was time to prednisolone or antibiotic-requiring exacerbation or death from day 20 to day 365. RESULTS: The trial was stopped prematurely based in lack of recruitment during the COVID-19 pandemic, this decision was endorsed by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board. Forty-nine outpatients were included in the study. There was a reduction in risk of the primary outcome in the antibiotic group compared to the control group (HR 0.51 (95%CI 0.27-0.96), p = 0.037). The incidence of admissions with exacerbation within one year was 1.1 (95%CI 0.6-1.7) in the dual antibiotic group vs. 2.9 (95%CI 1.3-4.5) in the control group, p = 0.037. CONCLUSIONS: Use of dual systemic antibiotics for 14 days against P. aeruginosa in outpatients with chronic lung diseases and no judged need for hospitalisation, improved clinical outcomes markedly. The main limitation was the premature closure of the trial. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03262142, registration date 2017-08-25.
38614868	Safety and efficacy of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor in people with Cystic Fibrosis following liver transplantation: A systematic review.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Cystic Fibrosis (CF) liver disease progresses to liver failure requiring transplantation in about 3 % of patients, 0.7 % of CF patients are post liver transplant. The prognosis of CF has improved with the introduction of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI). Due to the paucity of data and concerns regarding interactions with immunosuppressive drug regimens, there is no general consensus on use of ETI post liver transplantation. The aim of this review is to report the safety and efficacy of ETI in CF patients who underwent liver transplantation. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted through MEDLINE/Pubmed and EMBASE databases. English-written articles reporting clinical data on liver transplanted CF patients treated with ETI were included. Article quality was evaluated using the Critical Appraisal Checklist for Case Reports. RESULTS: Twenty cases were retrieved from 6 reports. Temporary discontinuation and/or dose reduction due to elevated transaminases was required in 5 cases. ETI restarted on a reduced dose was tolerated in 3 out of 5 patients, 1 patient tolerated full dose. Tacrolimus dose change was required in 14 cases, in 1 case ETI was discontinued due to tacrolimus toxicity. Improvement in percentage predicted FEV1 was noted in 15/19 patients (median +17 %, range 8 %-38 %). CONCLUSIONS: In the majority of liver transplanted patients ETI is well tolerated, although adverse events and liver function abnormalities may occur. Close monitoring of liver function and tacrolimus level is warranted. Significant improvement in lung function after ETI initiation is confirmed, highlighting the importance of accessing this medication for this group of patients.
38724312	Self-care deficits reported by school children with cystic fibrosis.	BACKGROUND: Self-care refers to the ability that an individual has or develops to regulate the functioning of the body. Health status and age are factors associated with dependency on, and the need for, someone else to take over self-care. In the present case, there was a self-care deficit. Cystic fibrosis is a chronic disease that occurs in one in 10,000 live births in Brazil, and the affected population in the country is predominantly pediatric (approximately 73%). Support from nursing teams is necessary to improve patients' skills until they can take full responsibility for their self-care. PURPOSE: This study aimed to identify self-care deficits based on reports from schoolchildren with cystic fibrosis. DESIGN AND METHOD: A qualitative study was conducted with eight Brazilian schoolchildren with cystic fibrosis, using an art-based technique during interviews. Minayo's thematic analysis was used for data analysis and interpretation. RESULTS: These results emerged from Orem's theory of self-care deficits and needs. A main theme labeled as universal self-care requisites was identified, and three subthemes were derived-maintenance of an adequate air supply; maintenance of a balance between activity and rest; and avoiding risks to life, bodily functions, and well-being. CONCLUSION: Schoolchildren living with cystic fibrosis have a negative attitude toward their disease, which makes it difficult for them to acquire the ability to care for themselves with greater autonomy. This leads to deficits in the self-care delivered by providers. IMPLICATIONS TO PRACTICE: It is necessary to recognize the deficits in self-care and the extent to which children living with cystic fibrosis depend on self-care providers. Families must be aware of these self-care deficits to develop holistic self-care abilities.
38747779	The intertwining of discourses in the diagnostic construction of cystic fibrosis: a perspective on access and barriers.	The complexities referred to in the search for "accuracy" in the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (CF) point to reflections around "what is needed" in the current situation of "precision medicine". We analyzed the discourses of 19 social actors belonging to the community of specialists in cystic fibrosis, exploring the semantic meanings of the word "precision", and the barriers to diagnosis and innovations in therapeutics. We adopted the critical discourse analysis (CDA) of Norman Fairclough in order to achieve the discursive constructions around the integrality of care, the guarantee and equitable supply of basic social needs. Access was identified as an emic category when in the social arenas of dispute are health needs and the right to life.
38749862	Combined Liver-Pancreas Transplantation as Novel Treatment for Patient With Cystic Fibrosis: A Case Report.	BACKGROUND: A 21-year-old woman diagnosed with cystic fibrosis developed cirrhosis, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. The patient qualified for double organ liver-pancreas transplantation beyond typical indications. The respiratory symptoms of cystic fibrosis were moderate and well-treated. The patient was endangered mainly by liver insufficiency and recurrent hypoglycemia, which was due to the treatment of diabetes with high doses of insulin. Computed tomography showed mild bronchiectasis, cirrhotic liver, splenomegaly, and atrophy of the pancreas. Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonized the upper respiratory tract. Gastrointestinal complications were sufficient for the patient to be qualified for combined liver-pancreas transplantation. METHODS: First, a standard hepatectomy was performed. The liver was transplanted orthotopically. Subsequently, the team performed pancreas transplantation through a separate incision. The donor's duodenum was anastomosed to the recipient's jejunum, close to the ligament of Treitz. RESULTS: No serious complications were noted during the postoperative period. Transplanted organs started functioning without delay. The patient was discharged after 6 weeks in general good condition. Twenty months later, the patient felt well, and the grafts kept functioning properly. CONCLUSION: Combined liver-pancreas transplantation in patients with CF restores exocrine and endocrine pancreatic function and minimizes the risk of life-threatening complications associated with liver insufficiency. Improvement of life quality coincides with the possibility of discontinuing insulin and pancreatic enzyme supplementation. The combination of liver and pancreas transplantation may prevent advanced pulmonary complications, extend the prognosis of survival, and improve the long-term life quality.
38542363	Functional Consequences of CFTR Interactions in Cystic Fibrosis.	Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a fatal autosomal recessive disorder caused by the loss of function mutations within a single gene for the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR). CFTR is a chloride channel that regulates ion and fluid transport across various epithelia. The discovery of CFTR as the CF gene and its cloning in 1989, coupled with extensive research that went into the understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms of CF, have led to the development of revolutionary therapies in CF that we see today. The highly effective modulator therapies have increased the survival rates of CF patients and shifted the epidemiological landscape and disease prognosis. However, the differential effect of modulators among CF patients and the presence of non-responders and ineligible patients underscore the need to develop specialized and customized therapies for a significant number of patients. Recent advances in the understanding of the CFTR structure, its expression, and defined cellular compositions will aid in developing more precise therapies. As the lifespan of CF patients continues to increase, it is becoming critical to clinically address the extra-pulmonary manifestations of CF disease to improve the quality of life of the patients. In-depth analysis of the molecular signature of different CF organs at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels is rapidly advancing and will help address the etiological causes and variability of CF among patients and develop precision medicine in CF. In this review, we will provide an overview of CF disease, leading to the discovery and characterization of CFTR and the development of CFTR modulators. The later sections of the review will delve into the key findings derived from single-molecule and single-cell-level analyses of CFTR, followed by an exploration of disease-relevant protein complexes of CFTR that may ultimately define the etiological course of CF disease.
38926024	[Adherence to chest physiotherapy in adults with cystic fibrosis].	INTRODUCTION: Chest-physiotherapy is a key element in treatment of cystic fibrosis and patient adherence is a major issue in global cystic fibrosis care. This study aims to assess adherence to chest physiotherapy in adults with cystic fibrosis who not treated with tritherapy and to analyze the impact of certain factors on adherence. METHODS: Thus is a cross-sectional study, conducted using a questionnaire and a physiotherapy evaluation. Adherence to this treatment was measured in terms of quantitative and qualitative aspects. The impact on adherence of 15 factors was then assessed. RESULTS: Only 47% of patients could be considered as adherent, with a significant disparity between a quantitative and qualitative assessment. Gender, working time, pathology severity, the fact of being regularly followed by a physiotherapist, the perceived benefit of the sessions and their replacement by physical activity, seem associated with adherence to this treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Taking into account the qualitative aspect of the sessions, our study reveals a low rate, in our cohort, of adherence to respiratory physiotherapy, and highlights six factors likely to predominate. Regular follow-up by a physiotherapist seems to be a determining factor in adherence to this treatment.
38875118	LLL 44 - Module 3: Micronutrients in Chronic disease.	Micronutrients (MN), i.e. trace elements and vitamins, are essential organic molecules, which are required in the diet in relatively small amounts in any form of nutrition (oral, enteral, parenteral). The probability of MN depletion or deficiencies should be considered in all chronic illnesses, especially in those that can interfere with intake, digestion, or intestinal absorption. Low socio-economic status and food deprivation are recognized as the most prevalent reasons for MN deficiencies world-wide. Elderly multimorbid patients with multimodal therapy, as well as patients with long-lasting menu restrictions, are at high risk for both disease related malnutrition as well as multiple MN deficiencies, needing careful specific follow-up. The importance of monitoring MN blood levels along with CRP is essential for optimal care. Drug interactions are also highlighted. In patients with chronic conditions depending on medical nutrition therapy, the provision of adequate dietary reference intakes (DRI) of MN doses and monitoring of their adequacy belongs to standard of care.
38708178	Enzyme-Linked Lipid Nanocarriers for Coping Pseudomonal Pulmonary Infection. Would Nanocarriers Complement Biofilm Disruption or Pave Its Road?	Introduction: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is associated with pulmonary Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections persistent to antibiotics. Methods: To eradicate pseudomonal biofilms, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) loaded with quorum-sensing-inhibitor (QSI, disrupting bacterial crosstalk), coated with chitosan (CS, improving internalization) and immobilized with alginate lyase (AL, destroying alginate biofilms) were developed. Results: SLNs (140-205 nm) showed prolonged release of QSI with no sign of acute toxicity to A549 and Calu-3 cells. The CS coating improved uptake, whereas immobilized-AL ensured >1.5-fold higher uptake and doubled SLN diffusion across the artificial biofilm sputum model. Respirable microparticles comprising SLNs in carbohydrate matrix elicited aerodynamic diameters MMAD (3.54, 2.48 microm) and fine-particle-fraction FPF (65, 48%) for anionic and cationic SLNs, respectively. The antimicrobial and/or antibiofilm activity of SLNs was explored in Pseudomonas aeruginosa reference mucoid/nonmucoid strains as well as clinical isolates. The full growth inhibition of planktonic bacteria was dependent on SLN type, concentration, growth medium, and strain. OD measurements and live/dead staining proved that anionic SLNs efficiently ceased biofilm formation and eradicated established biofilms, whereas cationic SLNs unexpectedly promoted biofilm progression. AL immobilization increased biofilm vulnerability; instead, CS coating increased biofilm formation confirmed by 3D-time lapse confocal imaging. Incubation of SLNs with mature biofilms of P. aeruginosa isolates increased biofilm density by an average of 1.5-fold. CLSM further confirmed the binding and uptake of the labeled SLNs in P. aeruginosa biofilms. Considerable uptake of CS-coated SLNs in non-mucoid strains could be observed presumably due to interaction of chitosan with LPS glycolipids in the outer cell membrane of P. aeruginosa. Conclusion: The biofilm-destructive potential of QSI/SLNs/AL inhalation is promising for site-specific biofilm-targeted interventional CF therapy. Nevertheless, the intrinsic/extrinsic fundamentals of nanocarrier-biofilm interactions require further investigation.
38759874	Long-Term therapy with CFTR modulators consistently improves glucose metabolism in adolescents and adults with Cystic Fibrosis.	BACKGROUND: Impaired glycemic control and the subsequent development of Cystic fibrosis Related Diabetes (CFRD) are prevalent complications, affecting up to 50% of adults with cystic fibrosis (CF). CFTR modulator (CFTRm) therapies improve pulmonary functions, reduce exacerbation rates, increase survival in people with CF (pwCF) and appear to have a positive effect on extrapulmonary manifestations, such as nutritional state, improvements in upper respiratory symptoms, and quality of life. Initial findings indicate that CFTRm may have a positive impact on short-term glycemic control; however, long-term effects remain uncertain at present. METHODS: In this retrospective study, data were collected and analyzed on 15 pwCF, ages 13-37 years, started on CFTRm therapy. Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) results were compared pre- and post-CFTRm therapy. RESULTS: The 120-minute OGTT value decreased from 159.7 to 130.4 post-CFTRm (p = 0.047). The average time elapsed between the two OGTT tests was 49.87 months (ranging 9-157 months, median 38 months). Glycemic status improved in six pwCF (two CFRD to normal (NGT)/indeterminate (INDET) glucose tolerance; two impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) to INDET; two INDET to NGT) and worsened in one (IGT to CFRD). Six pwCF and NGT remained stable with no changes in glycemic statues throughout the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: CFTRm therapy may decelerate the glycemic control deterioration in pwCF over an extended period. These findings indicate the need for periodic OGTTs following the initiation of CFTRm therapy to appropriately adjust insulin requirements and prevent hypoglycemia. Further larger cohorts are required to authenticate and substantiate these findings.
39105344	Advanced cystic fibrosis liver disease: Endovascular, endoscopic, radiologic, and surgical considerations.	Up to 90% of people with CF (pwCF) will have some form of hepatobiliary involvement. This manuscript aims to explore the different endovascular, endoscopic, radiological and surgical procedures available to diagnose and manage the most severe form of CF hepatobiliary involvement (CFHBI) known as advanced cystic fibrosis liver disease (aCFLD), seen in 10% of pwCF. These procedures and interventions include liver biopsy, hepatic venous pressure gradient measurement, gastrostomy tube placement to optimize nutrition, paracentesis, endoscopic variceal control of bleeding and portosystemic shunting before liver transplantation. By utilizing advanced diagnostic or surgical techniques, healthcare professionals of pwCF can more effectively manage patients with CFHBI and aCFLD and potentially improve patient outcomes.
39105352	Pancreas and pancreatitis: Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.	Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) is highly prevalent among individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF). Individuals diagnosed with EPI are often labeled as having "pancreas insufficient cystic fibrosis (PI-CF)" while those with normal exocrine function are labeled as "pancreas sufficient CF (PS-CF)." This diagnosis of EPI relies on clinical and laboratory features and management involves consumption of pancreas enzyme replacement therapy. In this review, we discuss the nuances of diagnosis and management of EPI in CF. We also present emerging evidence on the effects of CFTR modulating agents on the management of EPI, and speculate that these medications may lead to greater heterogeneity in management of EPI in CF moving forward.
38554035	Perceived burden of respiratory physiotherapy in people with cystic fibrosis taking elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor combination: a 1-year observational study.	BACKGROUND: To limit the progression of disease, people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) perform daily respiratory physiotherapy, which is perceived as the most burdensome routine in managing their condition. The elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor (ETI) combination has changed respiratory management. OBJECTIVE: To investigate how the perceived treatment burden changed in 1 year of treatment with ETI. DESIGN: Prospective observational study. METHODS: Ad hoc questionnaires for the pwCF and for the caregivers of pwCF < 18 years were administered before the initiation of ETI therapy and then at 6-12 months. The Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) and the Sinonasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) were administered to explore disease-related symptoms and social limitations. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire was used to determine levels of physical activity. Mixed-effect models were fitted to explore whether the time engaged in respiratory physiotherapy changed during 1 year. RESULTS: The study included 47/184 pwCF aged 21.4 (5.7) years, who completed 1 year of ETI therapy. At 6 months, time on aerosol therapy was decreased by 2.5 (95% CI -32.9 to 27.8) min/day, time on airway clearance therapies (ACTs) was decreased by 8.8 (95% CI -25.9 to 8.3) min/day, and time for cleaning and disinfecting respiratory equipment was decreased by 10.6 (95% CI -26.5 to 5.3) min/day. At 1 year, gains in time saved were nearly 15 min/day on average. At 1 year, 5/47 (10.6%) pwCF reported that they had discontinued positive expiratory pressure mask. CONCLUSION: PwCF on ETI may note less time engaged in their daily respiratory physiotherapy routine. Nonetheless, aerosol therapy, ACTs and maintaining respiratory equipment were still perceived as time-consuming daily activities.
38517142	Disparities in pediatric hospital use during transition to adult healthcare for young adults with childhood-onset chronic conditions.	BACKGROUND: Young adults (YA) with childhood-onset chronic conditions-particularly YA with cystic fibrosis (CF), congenital heart disease (CHD), and sickle cell disease (SCD)-continue to have pediatric hospital admissions. Factors associated with this continued pediatric hospital use remain underexplored. OBJECTIVE: To determine if pediatric hospital use by YA differed (1) across condition and (2) within each condition by sociodemographic factors. METHODS: Conducted a cross-sectional analysis of admissions for YA 22-35 years with CF, CHD, and SCD from 2016 to 2020 in the National Inpatient Sample. Admissions for YA with CF, CHD, and SCD were identified by international classification of diseases, 10th revision-clinical modification diagnosis codes. To determine if conditions or sociodemographic factors were associated with YA pediatric hospital use, we used multivariable logistic regression with separate models for the different objectives. RESULTS: YA with SCD had lower odds of pediatric hospital use compared to YA with CF. Relationships between sociodemographic factors and pediatric hospital use varied. Black YA with both CF and CHD had lower odds of pediatric hospital use than white YA with CF and CHD. For YA with SCD, despite 17,810 (6.5%) having rural residence, zero (0) had pediatric hospital use; whereas YA with CF living in a rural area had greater odds of pediatric hospital use compared to urban residents. CONCLUSION: YA with SCD used pediatric hospitals less than YA with either CF or CHD. Coupled with our findings that Black YA with CF and CHD had less pediatric hospital use, these data may reflect systematic racial differences within pediatric to adult healthcare transition programs.
38483544	Pharmacokinetics of polymyxin B in different populations: a systematic review.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Despite being clinically utilized for the treatment of infections, the limited therapeutic range of polymyxin B (PMB), along with considerable interpatient variability in its pharmacokinetics and frequent occurrence of acute kidney injury, has significantly hindered its widespread utilization. Recent research on the population pharmacokinetics of PMB has provided valuable insights. This study aims to review relevant literature to establish a theoretical foundation for individualized clinical management. METHODS: Follow PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, Pop-PK studies of PMB were searched in PubMed and EMBASE database systems from the inception of the database until March 2023. RESULT: To date, a total of 22 population-based studies have been conducted, encompassing 756 subjects across six different countries. The recruited population in these studies consisted of critically infected individuals with multidrug-resistant bacteria, patients with varying renal functions, those with cystic fibrosis, kidney or lung transplant recipients, patients undergoing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), as well as individuals with obesity or pediatric populations. Among these studies, seven employed a one-compartmental model, with the range of typical clearance (CL) and volume (Vc) being 1.18-2.5L /h and 12.09-47.2 L, respectively. Fifteen studies employed a two-compartmental model, with the ranges of the clearance (CL) and volume of the central compartment (Vc), the volume of the peripheral compartment (Vp), and the intercompartment clearance (Q) were 1.27-8.65 L/h, 5.47-38.6 L, 4.52-174.69 L, and 1.34-24.3 L/h, respectively. Primary covariates identified in these studies included creatinine clearance and body weight, while other covariates considered were CRRT, albumin, age, and SOFA scores. Internal evaluation was conducted in 19 studies, with only one study being externally validated using an independent external dataset. CONCLUSION: We conclude that small sample sizes, lack of multicentre collaboration, and patient homogeneity are the primary reasons for the discrepancies in the results of the current studies. In addition, most of the studies limited in the internal evaluation, which confined the implementation of model-informed precision dosing strategies.
38920104	Diagnosis and treatment of cystic fibrosis in India: What is at stake for developing countries?	Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-threatening monogenic disease affecting thousands of people worldwide. Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an ion channel that facilitates transportation of water and salts across epithelial cell membranes through the conductance of Cl- and other anions. A dysfunctional CFTR due to abnormalities in the cftr gene causes CF, which is believed to be a rare disease in India mainly due to mis/underdiagnosis. Although numerous diagnostic methods and treatment options are available for CF globally, most of these are unaffordable for developing countries like India. Currently, CF symptoms are managed with mucolytics, antibiotics, anti-inflammatory drugs, and various CFTR modulators based on the type of defect. While a definitive cure for CF remains elusive, advancements in stem cell and gene therapies hold promise for permanent cure in the near future. In this review, we discuss the prevalence of CF cases in India, affordable diagnostic methods, and treatment options amenable for developing countries. We further emphasize the scope for the universal newborn screening programme.
38870301	In vivo editing of lung stem cells for durable gene correction in mice.	In vivo genome correction holds promise for generating durable disease cures; yet, effective stem cell editing remains challenging. In this work, we demonstrate that optimized lung-targeting lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) enable high levels of genome editing in stem cells, yielding durable responses. Intravenously administered gene-editing LNPs in activatable tdTomato mice achieved >70% lung stem cell editing, sustaining tdTomato expression in >80% of lung epithelial cells for 660 days. Addressing cystic fibrosis (CF), NG-ABE8e messenger RNA (mRNA)-sgR553X LNPs mediated >95% cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) DNA correction, restored CFTR function in primary patient-derived bronchial epithelial cells equivalent to Trikafta for F508del, corrected intestinal organoids and corrected R553X nonsense mutations in 50% of lung stem cells in CF mice. These findings introduce LNP-enabled tissue stem cell editing for disease-modifying genome correction.
38763840	Centralized intestinal organoid generation is a feasible and safe approach for personalized medicine as demonstrated in the HIT-CF Europe Organoid Study.	BACKGROUND: Patient-derived intestinal organoids (PDIOs) show great potential as in vitro drug testing platform for personalised medicine in Cystic Fibrosis and oncology. PDIOs can be generated by culturing adult stem cells obtained through rectal forceps biopsy or suction biopsy, but the safety of these procedures and the success rates of generating organoids after shipment to a centralized lab using these procedures has not been studied in this context. We here report the safety and success rates of both biopsy procedures and the subsequent generation of PDIOs in the international multicentre HIT-CF Organoid Study. METHODS: 502 biopsy procedures were conducted, on 489 adult people with Cystic Fibrosis from 33 different hospitals across 12 countries. Depending on the preference of the hospital, either rectal forceps biopsies or suction biopsies were obtained and internationally shipped to a central laboratory for organoid generation. RESULTS: No adverse events were reported for 280 forceps biopsy procedures, while 222 rectal suction biopsy procedures resulted in 2 adverse events, namely continued bleeding and a probably nonrelated gastroenteritis. The success rate of organoid generation from all biopsies was 95%, and the main reason for failure was insufficient sample viability (3.2%). CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that both rectal suction biopsy and forceps biopsy procedures are safe procedures. The high success rates of PDIO generation from the obtained tissue samples demonstrate the feasibility of the organoid technology for personalised in vitro testing in an international setting.
38664916	Evolution of nutritional management in children with cystic fibrosis - a narrative review.	Nutrition has played a central role in the management and outcomes of people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) since the 1970s. Advances in therapies and practices in recent decades have led to a significant change in the patient landscape with dramatic improvements in life expectancy, as well as quality of life, bringing with it new issues. Historically, cystic fibrosis was a condition associated with childhood and malnutrition; however, changes in patient demographics, nutritional assessment and fundamental nutritional management have evolved, and it has become an increasingly prevalent adult disease with new nutritional challenges, including obesity. This paper aims to describe these changes and the impact and challenges they bring for those working in this field. Nutritional professionals will need to evolve, adapt and remain agile to the wider range of situations and support required for a new generation of pwCF. Specialised nutrition support will continue to be required, and it will be additionally important to improve and optimise quality of life and long-term health.
38906482	Effect of antimetabolite regimen on cellular and humoral immune response to SARS-COV-2 vaccination in solid organ transplant recipients.	OBJECTIVE: Novel mRNA-based vaccines have been proven to be powerful tools in combating the global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 protecting individuals, especially the immunocompromised, from COVID-19. Still, it remains largely unknown how solid organ transplant and different immunosuppressive medications affect development of vaccine-induced immunity. METHODS: In this work, we monitored humoral and cellular memory responses after mRNA SARS-CoV-2 two-doses and booster doses vaccination in cystic fibrosis lung transplanted patients (CFT) and compared them with both cystic fibrosis patients without lung transplant (CF) and with kidney transplant recipients (KT). In particular, we investigated the effects of immunosuppressive regimens on immune memory to SARS-CoV-2 after mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in transplanted patients. RESULTS: Our results showed that immunocompromised transplanted patients displayed a weak cellular and humoral memory to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination. In addition, obtained data clearly demonstrate that immunosuppressive therapy regimen including antimetabolites, further reduces patients' ability to respond to vaccination at both humoral and cell-mediated level. Notably, patient treated with antimetabolites showed a lower humoral and cellular response also after a booster dose vaccination. CONCLUSION: These results, even if obtained on a small patient's cohort, question whether immunocompromised patients need interventions to improve vaccine SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine response such as additional jab or modulation of immunosuppressive therapy.
38626860	A new era of targeting cystic fibrosis with non-viral delivery of genomic medicines.	Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a complex genetic respiratory disorder that necessitates innovative gene delivery strategies to address the mutations in the gene. This review delves into the promises and challenges of non-viral gene delivery for CF therapy and explores strategies to overcome these hurdles. Several emerging technologies and nucleic acid cargos for CF gene therapy are discussed. Novel formulation approaches including lipid and polymeric nanoparticles promise enhanced delivery through the CF mucus barrier, augmenting the potential of non-viral strategies. Additionally, safety considerations and regulatory perspectives play a crucial role in navigating the path toward clinical translation of gene therapy.
39080772	Lung transplant list withdrawal in a liver transplant patient thanks to elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor: a case report.	BACKGROUND: Elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor (ETI) is a transmembrane conductance regulator modulator that significantly improves lung function in patients affected by cystic fibrosis (CF). This triple drug is currently not indicated in liver transplant patients, as clinical trials including subjects with previous solid organ transplantation are lacking. CASE PRESENTATION: We report on a liver transplant girl with CF-related advanced pulmonary disease meeting clinical criteria for lung transplant, who started the triple modulator because she could not get on the lung transplant waiting list due to psycho-social motivations. Since initiation of ETI therapy, she has experienced a significant improvement in respiratory function and quality of life, without adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: This case shows that ETI therapy can represent a lifesaving drug for individuals without alternatives, even in liver transplant patients. The clinical benefits of the modulator overcome risks, which may be limited with a close drug monitoring of immunosuppressants serum levels and functional liver tests.
39322262	New drugs, new challenges in cystic fibrosis care.	Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease caused by variants in the gene encoding for the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, a chloride and bicarbonate channel. CFTR dysfunction results in a multiorgan disease with the main clinical features being exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and diffuse bronchiectasis with chronic airway infection leading to respiratory failure and premature death. Over the past decades, major progress has been made by implementing multidisciplinary care, including nutritional support, airway clearance techniques and antibiotics in specialised CF centres. The past decade has further seen the progressive development of oral medications, called CFTR modulators, for which around 80% of people with CF are genetically eligible in Europe. CFTR modulators partially restore ion transport and lead to a rapid and major improvement in clinical manifestations and lung function, presumably resulting in longer survival. CFTR modulators have been game-changing in the care of people with CF. However, many questions remain unanswered, such as the long-term effects of CFTR modulators, especially when treatment is started very early in life, or the new CF-related disease emerging due to CFTR modulators. Moreover, severe complications of CF, such as diabetes or cirrhosis, are not reversed on CFTR modulators and around 20% of people with CF bear CFTR variants leading to a CFTR protein that is unresponsive to CFTR modulators. Challenges also arise in adapting CF care to a changing disease. In this review article, we highlight the new questions and challenges emerging from this revolution in CF care.
38995399	Advances in diabetes technology to improve the lives of people with cystic fibrosis.	People with cystic fibrosis (CF) are at risk for dysglycaemia caused by progressive beta cell dysfunction and destruction due to pancreatic exocrine disease and fibrosis. CF-related diabetes (CFRD) is a unique form of diabetes that has distinctive features from both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Recent advances in diabetes technology may be of particular benefit in this population given the complex, multi-system organ involvement and challenging health issues that people with CFRD often face. This review summarises how diabetes technologies, such as continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) and insulin delivery devices: (1) have improved our understanding of CFRD, including how hyperglycaemia affects clinical outcomes in people with CF; (2) may be helpful in the screening and diagnosis of CFRD; and (3) offer promise for improving the management of CFRD and easing the burden that this diagnosis can add to an already medically complicated patient population.
38652717	Lytic bacteriophages induce the secretion of antiviral and proinflammatory cytokines from human respiratory epithelial cells.	Phage therapy is a therapeutic approach to treat multidrug-resistant (MDR) infections that employs lytic bacteriophages (phages) to eliminate bacteria. Despite the abundant evidence for its success as an antimicrobial in Eastern Europe, there is scarce data regarding its effects on the human host. Here, we aimed to understand how lytic phages interact with cells of the airway epithelium, the tissue site that is colonized by bacterial biofilms in numerous chronic respiratory disorders. Using a panel of Pseudomonas aeruginosa phages and human airway epithelial cells (AECs) derived from a person with cystic fibrosis (CF), we determined that interactions between phages and epithelial cells depend on specific phage properties as well as physiochemical features of the microenvironment. Although poor at internalizing phages, the airway epithelium responds to phage exposure by changing its transcriptional profile and secreting antiviral and proinflammatory cytokines that correlate with specific phage families. Overall, our findings indicate that mammalian responses to phages are heterogenous and could potentially alter the way that respiratory local defenses aid in bacterial clearance during phage therapy. Thus, besides phage receptor specificity in a particular bacterial isolate, the criteria to select lytic phages for therapy should be expanded to include mammalian cell responses.
38852109	Investigations, management and outcome of neonates presenting with distal intestinal obstruction: challenging the need for contrast enemas.	PURPOSE: To characterise the investigations, management and ultimate diagnosis of neonates with distal intestinal obstruction. METHODS: Retrospective review of term (> 37 weeks) neonates with admission diagnosis of distal intestinal obstruction over 10 years (2012-2022). Patient pathways were identified and associations between presentations, response to treatments and outcome investigated. RESULTS: A total of 124 neonates were identified and all included. Initial management was colonic irrigation in 108, contrast enema in 4, and laparotomy in 12. Of those responding to irrigations none underwent contrast enema. Ultimately, 22 neonates proceeded to laparotomy. Overall, 106 had a suction rectal biopsy and 41 had genetic testing for cystic fibrosis. Final diagnosis was Hirschsprung disease (HD) in 67, meconium ileus with cystic fibrosis (CF) in 9, meconium plug syndrome in 19 (including 3 with CF), intestinal atresia in 10 and no formal diagnosis in 17. Median length of neonatal unit stay was 11 days (7-19). CONCLUSIONS: Initial management of neonates with distal bowel obstruction should be colonic irrigation since this is therapeutic in the majority and significantly reduces the need for contrast enema. These infants should all have suction rectal biopsy to investigate for HD unless another diagnosis is evident. If a meconium plug is passed, testing for CF is recommended. Evaluation and therapy are multimodal and time consuming, placing burden on resources and families.
39074617	Safety and Tolerability of Bronchoscopic and Nebulised Administration of Bacteriophage.	INTRODUCTION: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an organism well known for causing significant morbidity and mortality in people living with chronic lung conditions such as cystic fibrosis. We describe the safety, tolerability, and potential efficacy of bronchoscopic and nebulised bacteriophage administration, offering insights into a potential breakthrough for the treatment of chronic infections particularly in children and adolescents. METHOD: A 12-year-old female (F12) and a 17-year-old male (M17), both diagnosed with cystic fibrosis and chronic P. aeruginosa lung infection, underwent bacteriophage treatment (BT). The administration involved bronchoscopic instillation and subsequent nebulisation. This was performed concurrently with intravenous antibiotics and regular physiotherapy delivered in an in-patient setting for 14 days. Microbiological, clinical, and lung function assessments were conducted to assess this treatment modality. RESULTS: No adverse events (fever, localised reaction, wheeze or bronchospasm) occurred during BT. F12 demonstrated a 4% increase, while M17 showed a 5% improvement in FEV1% from their best FEV1% over the past three years following BT. A 12% (F12) and an 8% (M17) improvement from baseline FEV1% was observed. For F12 P. aeruginosa was not isolated from her sputum despite 12 previous hospitalisations for intravenous antibiotics. CONCLUSION: Bronchoscopic and nebulised routes of bacteriophage administration were well-tolerated in these two adolescents. This early report underscores the potential of this treatment modality and encourages clinicians and researchers to actively explore this innovative approach.
38755109	Unmet challenges in cystic fibrosis treatment with modulators.	INTRODUCTION: 'Highly effective' modulator therapies (HEMTs) have radically changed the Cystic Fibrosis (CF) therapeutic landscape. These novel therapeutic approaches have permitted unprecedented opportunities for quality-of-life improvement and for enhancing people with CF's (pwCF) life expectancy. AREAS COVERED: The aim of this review is to describe the current knowledge gaps. A comprehensive search strategy was undertaken to assess impact of HEMT in life of pwCF, treatment challenges in specific populations such as very young children, and research needs. EXPERT OPINION: HEMTs are prescribed for pwCF with definite genotypes. The heterogeneity of variants complicates treatment possibilities and around 10% of pwCF worldwide remains ineligible. Genotype-specific treatments are prompting theratyping and personalized medicine strategies. Improvement in lung function and quality of life increase survival rates, shifting CF from a pediatric to an adult disease. This implies new studies addressing long-term efficacy, side effects, emergence of adult co-morbidities and possible drug-drug interactions. More sensitive and predictive biomarkers for both efficacy and toxicity are warranted. As HEMTs cross the placenta and are found in breast milk, studies addressing the potential consequences of treatment during pregnancy and breastfeeding are urgently needed. Finally, although the treatment and expected outcomes of CF have improved dramatically in high- and middle-income countries, lack of access in low-income countries to these lifesaving and life-changing medicines highlights inequity of care worldwide.
38806313	Hemorrhagic Pneumonia in a Kidney Transplant Recipient Caused by Stenotrophomonas Maltophilia Infection: A Case Report.	Pneumonia is a common nosocomial complication in transplant patients. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is recognized as a common cause and is typically seen in immunocompromised and critically ill patients. S. maltophilia, a nonfermenting gram-negative rod, ranks as the third most common nosocomial pathogen, following Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter. The bacteria are frequently found in environmental sources and are prevalent in healthcare facilities, including in tap water faucets, shower outlets, air-cooling systems, intravenous fluids, catheters, dialysis machines, and oxygen humidifiers. This bacterium possesses the ability to rapidly form biofilms, enabling it to colonize new surfaces in less than 24 hours. While S. maltophilia generally exhibits low virulence, there remains uncertainty among many clinicians regarding whether it is merely a colonizer or the primary cause of infection. Although S. maltophilia infections are rare in immunocompetent individuals, the species is increasingly recognized as an opportunistic pathogen in vulnerable populations such as those with cystic fibrosis, cancer, and other conditions leading to immunosuppression. S. maltophilia now recognized as a causative agent in various clinical syndromes, primarily affecting the lungs and bloodstream. We present a case of S. maltophilia-associated lung infection in a kidney transplant recipient, emphasizing the significance of underlying diseases and associated signs and symptoms.
39125890	Phage Therapy: An Alternative Approach to Combating Multidrug-Resistant Bacterial Infections in Cystic Fibrosis.	Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) are prone to developing life-threatening lung infections with a variety of pathogens that are difficult to eradicate, such as Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc), Hemophilus influenzae, Mycobacterium abscessus (Mab), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus. These infections still remain an important issue, despite the therapy for CF having considerably improved in recent years. Moreover, prolonged exposure to antibiotics in combination favors the development and spread of multi-resistant bacteria; thus, the development of alternative strategies is crucial to counter antimicrobial resistance. In this context, phage therapy, i.e., the use of phages, viruses that specifically infect bacteria, has become a promising strategy. In this review, we aim to address the current status of phage therapy in the management of multidrug-resistant infections, from compassionate use cases to ongoing clinical trials, as well as the challenges this approach presents in the particular context of CF patients.
38980071	Efficacies of omadacycline + amikacin + imipenem and an all-oral regimen omadacycline + clofazimine + linezolid in a mouse model of M. abscessus lung disease.	Treatment outcomes for Mycobacteroides abscessus (Mab, also known as Mycobacterium abscessus) disease are still unsatisfactory, mainly due to issues with drug toxicity, tolerability, and efficacy. Treating Mab disease is challenging due to its high baseline antibiotic resistance, initial requirement for intravenous therapy, and poor medication tolerance. Omadacycline, a new tetracycline, is active against Mab. Since any new antibiotic effective against Mab is expected to be used in combination with other antibiotics, we evaluated the efficacy of two triple-drug combinations comprising omadacycline, omadacycline + amikacin + imipenem, and omadacycline + clofazimine + linezolid against two contemporary Mab clinical isolates in a mouse model of Mab lung disease. Antibiotic administration was initiated 1-week post-infection and was given daily, with Mab burden in the lungs at treatment completion serving as the endpoint. Omadacycline alone moderately reduced Mab levels and maintained better health in mice compared to untreated ones, which typically suffered from the infection. The omadacycline + clofazimine + linezolid combination showed immediate bactericidal activity and enhanced efficacy over 6 weeks, particularly against the more resistant strain (M9507). However, the clofazimine + linezolid combination lacked early bactericidal activity. When combined with amikacin and imipenem, omadacycline did not improve the regimen's effectiveness over 4 weeks of treatment. Our study showed that omadacycline + clofazimine + linezolid exhibited significant bactericidal activity over an extended treatment duration. However, adding omadacycline to amikacin and imipenem did not improve regimen effectiveness against the evaluated clinical isolates within 4 weeks. Further research in Mab disease patients is needed to determine the most effective omadacycline-containing regimen.IMPORTANCEMycobacteroides abscessus is a common environmental bacterium that causes infections in people with compromised lung function, including those with bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and weakened immune systems, especially among older individuals. Treating M. abscessus disease is challenging due to the limited effectiveness and toxicity of current antibiotics, which often require prolonged use. Omadacycline, a new antibiotic, shows promise against M. abscessus. Using a mouse model that mimics M. abscessus disease in humans, we studied the effectiveness of including omadacycline with recommended antibiotics. Adding omadacycline to clofazimine and linezolid significantly improved treatment outcomes, rapidly clearing the bacteria from the lungs and maintaining effectiveness throughout. This oral combination is convenient for patients. However, adding omadacycline to amikacin and imipenem did not improve treatment effectiveness within 4 weeks. Further study with M. abscessus patients is necessary to optimize omadacycline-based treatment strategies for this disease.
39053676	Inhalable tobramycin EEG powder formulation for treating Pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced lung infection.	Pulmonary delivery of antibiotics is an effective strategy in treating bacterial lung infection for cystic fibrosis patients, by achieving high local drug concentrations and reducing overall systemic exposure compared to systemic administration. However, the inherent anatomical lung defense mechanisms, formulation characteristics, and drug-device combination determine the treatment efficacy of the aerosol delivery approach. In this study, we prepared a new tobramycin (Tobi) dry powder aerosol using excipient enhanced growth (EEG) technology and evaluated the in vitro and in vivo aerosol performance. We further established a Pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced lung infection rat model using an in-house designed novel liquid aerosolizer device. Notably, novel liquid aerosolizer yields comparable lung infection profiles despite administering 3-times lower P. aeruginosa CFU per rat in comparison to the conventional intratracheal administration. Dry powder insufflator (e.g. Penn-Century DP-4) to administer small powder masses to experimental animals is no longer commercially available. To address this gap, we developed a novel rat air-jet dry powder insufflator (Rat AJ DPI) that can emit 68-70 % of the loaded mass for 2 mg and 5 mg of Tobi-EEG powder formulations, achieving a high rat lung deposition efficiency of 79 % and 86 %, respectively. Rat AJ DPI can achieve homogenous distribution of Tobi EEG powder formulations at both loaded mass (2 mg and 5 mg) over all five lung lobes in rats. We then demonstrated that Tobi EEG formulation delivered by Rat AJ DPI can significantly decrease CFU counts in both trachea and lung lobes at 2 mg (p < 0.05) and 5 mg (p < 0.001) loaded mass compared to the untreated P. aeruginosa-infected group. Tobi EEG powder formulation delivered by the novel Rat AJ DPI showed excellent efficiencies in substantially reducing the P. aeruginosa-induced lung infection in rats.
38551092	Evaluating the contribution of the Glittre-ADL test in adults with cystic fibrosis.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Cardiopulmonary and skeletal muscle impairment and poor physical activity are potential contributors to reduced functional capacity in cystic fibrosis (CF). The Glittre-ADL test (TGlittre) has great potential for clinical use in adult CF adults, as it meets the need for a comprehensive assessment of physical function using tasks similar to activities of daily living. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of TGlittre in CF adults compared to the 6-min walk test (6MWT) and, secondarily, to quantify the associations of their results with pulmonary function, muscle strength, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). METHODS: This cross-sectional study evaluated 34 CF adults and compared them with 34 subjects from a control group. The participants underwent the following assessments: functional capacity using TGlittre and 6MWT; spirometry; respiratory muscle strength; handgrip strength (HGS); and HRQoL using the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R). RESULTS: While CF patients showed a longer time to perform TGlittre compared to controls (134 (119-150) versus 107 (95-126) % of the predicted time p = 0.0002), no difference between these groups was observed in the 6MWT. When the second TGlittre was compared to the first TGlittre, there was a significant decrease in total time for both CF patients (p < 0.0001) and controls (p = 0.0001). TGlittre time correlated with 6MWT distance (6MWD) (rs = -0.641, p < 0.0001), HGS (rs = -0.364, p = 0.034), peripheral oxygen saturation at the end of the test (rs = -0.463, p = 0.006) and the "digestive symptoms" domain of CFQ-R (rs = 0.376, p = 0.028). TGlittre time was shorter in patients who engaged in regular physical activity (3.10 (2.49-3.39) min versus 3.28 (2.95-3.53) min, p = 0.016). CONCLUSIONS: TGlittre is more effective than the 6MWT in detecting limitations during exercise. There is an important learning effect of TGlittre in adult CF patients. TGlittre time was correlated with 6MWD, HGS, oxygen saturation level, and the patient's level of physical activity.
38646702	Impact of pseudomonas aeruginosa on resource utilization and costs in patients with exacerbated non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis.	Aims Non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFB) is a chronic progressive respiratory disorder occurring at a rate ranging from 4.2 to 278.1 cases per 100,000 persons, depending on age, in the United States. For many patients with NCFB, the presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) makes treatment more complicated and typically has worse outcomes. Management of NCFB can be challenging, warranting a better understanding of the burden of illness for NCFB, treatments applied, healthcare resources used, and subsequent treatment costs. Comparing patients diagnosed with exacerbated NCFB, with or without PA on antibiotic utilization, treatments, and healthcare resources utilization and costs, was the purpose of this study.Materials and Methods This was a retrospective cohort study of commercial claims from IQVIA's PharMetrics Plus database (01/01/2006-12/31/2020). Study patients with a diagnosis of NCFB were stratified into two groups based on presence or absence of PA, then followed to identify demographic characteristics, comorbid conditions, antibiotic treatment regimen prescribed, healthcare resources utilized, and costs of care.Results The results showed that patients with exacerbated NCFB who were PA+ had significantly more oral antibiotic fills per patient per year, more inpatient admissions with a longer length of stay, and more outpatient encounters than those who were PA-. For costs, PA+ patients also had significantly greater total healthcare costs per patient when compared to those who were PA-.Conclusion Exacerbated NCFB with PA+ was associated with increased antibiotic usage, greater resource utilization, and increased costs. The major contributor to the cost differences was the use of inpatient services. Treatment strategies aimed at reducing the need for inpatient treatment could lessen the disparities observed in patients with NCFB.

39185776	[Self-care capacity of adult cystic fibrosis patients during transition/transfer between services].	BACKGROUND: To analyze the knowledge, abilities, and emotional state of cystic fibrosis patients during a specific follow-up period and compare this with the recall they had of the transition (planned and gradual shift from the pediatric unit) / transfer (direct change skipping the steps recommended by the guidelines) to a specialized cystic fibrosis adult unit. METHODS: Prospective cross-sectional study with cystic fibrosis adult patients under follow-up in a specialist consultation. Group 1 were patients who transitioned and Group 2 were transferred patients. The following information was collected: sociodemographic variables, degree of knowledge, skills, and emotional state using a survey designed for this purpose (as part of the internal consistency validation process). Participants also completed the emotional subscale of Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised. Inter-group comparisons were made for the transition/transfer, at the follow-up, and during the evolution. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients were analyzed; 65.8% male; mean age 31.9 years (SD =10.1). At the transition, Group 1 (n=19; 54.3%) had greater knowledge about their medication and reduced ability to manage appointments and making decisions in comparison to Group 2 at transfer. At follow-up, Group 1 made a better report on their emotional state and significantly improved their ability to manage appointments, communication, and decision-making. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who were moved to an adult cystic fibrosis unit through transition were more knowledgeable about their medications. However, those who were transferred managed their appointments and decision-making better, but felt sadder.
38934771	Validation of the Integrated Palliative Care Outcome Scale (IPOS) in adults with cystic fibrosis.	BACKGROUND: A primary palliative care model for cystic fibrosis (CF) recommends using the Integrated Palliative Care Outcome Scale (IPOS) for screening. Validation of the IPOS is needed. METHODS: This secondary analysis utilized baseline data from a multisite trial of the palliative care model, Improving Life with CF. Adults with CF completed the IPOS, the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale-CF (MSAS-CF), the CF Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R), the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). IPOS structure was assessed using Cronbach alpha coefficients and a factor analysis. Construct validity was evaluated through bivariate relationships between IPOS scores and other questionnaire scores, and linear regressions assessing the extent to which the IPOS explains variance in quality-of-life domains. RESULTS: The sample comprised 256 adults with complete IPOS data. alpha coefficients were .86 for the IPOS total score, .81 for the Physical Symptoms subscale, .79 for the Emotional Symptoms subscale, and .63 for the Communication/Practical Issues subscale. A two-component factor structure best aligned with the current subscales. IPOS scores were significantly associated with other measures; associations with MSAS-CF and CFQ-R subscales differentiated the IPOS Physical and Emotional subscales. The IPOS total score provided unique information about the variance in the CFQ-R Physical Functioning and Respiratory Symptoms domain scores. CONCLUSIONS: In adults with CF, the IPOS has acceptable internal consistency and there is evidence of construct validity. These findings support adoption of the IPOS in the primary palliative care model for CF.
39293854	Neutrophil serine proteases in cystic fibrosis: role in disease pathogenesis and rationale as a therapeutic target.	Chronic airway inflammation is a central feature in the pathogenesis of bronchiectasis (BE), which can be caused by cystic fibrosis (CFBE; hereafter referred to as CF lung disease) and non-CF-related conditions (NCFBE). Inflammation in both CF lung disease and NCFBE is predominantly driven by neutrophils, which release proinflammatory cytokines and granule proteins, including neutrophil serine proteases (NSPs). NSPs include neutrophil elastase, proteinase 3 and cathepsin G. An imbalance between NSPs and their antiproteases has been observed in people with CF lung disease and people with NCFBE. While the role of the protease/antiprotease imbalance is well established in both CF lung disease and NCFBE, effective therapies targeting NSPs are lacking. In recent years, the introduction of CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator therapy has immensely improved outcomes in many people with CF (pwCF). Despite this, evidence suggests that airway inflammation persists, even in pwCF treated with CFTR modulator therapy. In this review, we summarise current data on neutrophilic inflammation in CF lung disease to assess whether neutrophilic inflammation and high, uncontrolled NSP levels play similar roles in CF lung disease and in NCFBE. We discuss similarities between the neutrophilic inflammatory profiles of people with CF lung disease and NCFBE, potentially supporting a similar therapeutic approach. Additionally, we present evidence suggesting that neutrophilic inflammation persists in pwCF treated with CFTR modulator therapy, at levels similar to those in people with NCFBE. Collectively, these findings highlight the ongoing need for new treatment strategies targeting neutrophilic inflammation in CF lung disease.
38981729	Gene therapy - once just a dream, now a reality.	Gene therapy is gradually becoming a mainstream treatment modality and is no longer the preserve of large university departments whose laboratories master nucleic acid analytical procedures and whose clinical teams manage its administration. It was originally designed for genetic diseases that, because of their prevalence, were a group known as rare diseases. Gene therapy has so far been applied in children to act before the disease development. These new treatments have also begun to be applied for common diseases such as metabolic disorders (e. g. diabetes) and even for those that are increasingly affecting us, such as various malignancies and diseases of the central nervous system (e. g. Alzheimer's disease). The targets targeted by GT are genes, where pathogenic alterations in the form of pathogenic variants (formerly mutations) induce phenotypic disorders, and our aim is either to knock them out of function (e. g. haemoglobinopathies) or to replace them with genes with normal function, which we introduce into the genome using one of the appropriate vectors, such as viruses or liposomes. The process of GT can take place directly inside the patient's body (in vivo) or outside the body on isolated cells (ex vivo), which are usually stem cells (iPSCs, induced pluripotent stem cell). After treatment, these cells are returned to the patient's body to fulfil their "destiny". In a broader sense, GT can target the product of gene transcription, which is the messenger RNA, or the end product of gene function, such as functional proteins (eg. cystic fibrosis). Any of these approaches have been used successfully in various diseases, depending on their availability, which is determined, among other things, by the costs associated with GT or the accessibility of the target tissue. Ultimately, it is not only the validation of the efficacy and safety of GT, but also economic reasons that determine why GT has been slow to develop and is mostly undertaken only by large and wealthy institutions. Another decisive factor is that from initial experimental work through clinical trials, the whole process of its development normally takes up to a decade.

38917792	Neutralizing antibodies after nebulized phage therapy in cystic fibrosis patients.	BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis (CF) patients are prone to recurrent multi-drug-resistant (MDR) bacterial lung infections. Under this scenario, phage therapy has been proposed as a promising tool. However, the limited number of reported cases hampers the understanding of clinical outcomes. Anti-phage immune responses have often been overlooked and only described following invasive routes of administration. METHODS: Three monophage treatments against Staphylococcus aureus and/or Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infections were conducted in cystic fibrosis patients. In-house phage preparations were nebulized over 10 days with standard-of-care antibiotics. Clinical indicators, bacterial counts, phage and antibiotic susceptibility, phage detection, and immune responses were monitored. FINDINGS: Bacterial load was reduced by 3-6 log in two of the treatments. No adverse events were described. Phages remained in sputum up to 33 days after completion of the treatment. In all cases, phage-neutralizing antibodies were detected in serum from 10 to 42 days post treatment, with this being the first report of anti-phage antibodies after nebulized therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Nebulized phage therapy reduced bacterial load, improving quality of life even without bacterial eradication. The emergence of antibodies emphasizes the importance of long-term monitoring to better understand clinical outcomes. These findings encourage the use of personalized monophage therapies in contrast to ready-to-use cocktails, which might induce undesirable antibody generation. FUNDING: This study was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities; Generalitat Valenciana; and a crowdfunding in collaboration with the Spanish Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.

38896732	Benzbromarone as adjuvant therapy for cystic fibrosis lung disease: a pilot clinical trial.	OBJECTIVE: Cystic fibrosis (CF) affects multiple organs, the most severe consequences being observed in the lungs. Despite significant progress in developing CF transmembrane conductance regulator-specific treatments for CF lung disease, exploring alternative CF-targeted medications seems reasonable. We sought to evaluate the potential beneficial effects of oral benzbromarone as an adjuvant therapy in CF patients with reduced lung function. METHODS: This was a prospective open-label pilot study of oral benzbromarone (100 mg/day) administered once daily for 90 days. Patients were followed at a tertiary referral center in southern Brazil. Safety was assessed by the number of reported adverse events. Secondary objectives included percent predicted FEV1 (FEV1%) and pulmonary exacerbations. RESULTS: Ten patients were enrolled. Benzbromarone was found to be safe, with no serious drug-related adverse events. Eight patients completed the study; the median relative change in FEV1% tended to increase during the treatment, showing an 8% increase from baseline at the final visit. However, a nonparametric test showed that the change was not significant (p = 0.06). Of a total of ten patients, only one experienced at least one pulmonary exacerbation during the study. CONCLUSIONS: Oral benzbromarone appears to be safe, and improved FEV1% has been observed in patients with CF. Further assessment in larger trials is warranted to elucidate whether oral benzbromarone can be a potential adjuvant therapy for CF.
38561094	Synergistic effects of inhaled aztreonam plus tobramycin on hypermutable cystic fibrosis Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates in a dynamic biofilm model evaluated by mechanism-based modeling and whole genome sequencing.	Hypermutable Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains are highly prevalent in chronic lung infections of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Acute exacerbations of these infections have limited treatment options. This study aimed to investigate inhaled aztreonam and tobramycin against clinical hypermutable P. aeruginosa strains using the CDC dynamic in vitro biofilm reactor (CBR), mechanism-based mathematical modeling (MBM) and genomic studies. Two CF multidrug-resistant strains were investigated in a 168h CBR (n=2 biological replicates). Regimens were inhaled aztreonam (75 mg 8-hourly) and tobramycin (300 mg 12-hourly) in monotherapies and combination. The simulated pharmacokinetic profiles of aztreonam and tobramycin (t1/2=3h) were based on published lung fluid concentrations in patients with CF. Total viable and resistant counts were determined for planktonic and biofilm bacteria. MBM of total and resistant bacterial counts, and whole genome sequencing were completed. Both isolates showed reproducible bacterial regrowth and resistance amplification for the monotherapies by 168h. The combination performed synergistically, with minimal resistant subpopulations compared to the respective monotherapies at 168h. Mechanistic synergy appropriately described the antibacterial effects of the combination regimen in the MBM. Genomic analysis of colonies recovered from monotherapy regimens indicated noncanonical resistance mechanisms were likely responsible for treatment failure. The combination of aztreonam and tobramycin was required to suppress regrowth and resistance of planktonic and biofilm bacteria in all biological replicates of both hypermutable multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa CF isolates. The developed MBM could be utilized for future investigations of this promising inhaled combination.
38945430	Risk factors for respiratory syncytial virus-associated acute lower respiratory infection in children under five years: An updated systematic review and meta-analysis.	OBJECTIVES: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) in young children. With substantial advances in RSV research, we aimed to conduct an updated systematic review of risk factors for RSV-ALRI in children under five years. METHODS: We updated our previously published literature search to November 2022 among three English databases and additionally searched three Chinese databases (from January 1995) to identify all relevant publications. We performed random-effects meta-analyses to estimate the pooled odds ratio and 95% confidence interval (CI) for each risk factor and each outcome (RSV-ALRI in the community and RSV-ALRI hospitalisation). RESULTS: A total of 47 studies were included (26 from the updated search). Indoor air pollution was identified as a possible risk factor for RSV-ALRI in the community (OR 1.45, 95% CI: 1.10-1.90). The identified risk factors for RSV-ALRI hospitalisation fall into four categories: demographic (male sex, Maori and Pacific ethnicities vs European or other ethnicities), pre- and post- neonatal (prematurity, low birth weight, small for gestational age, maternal smoking during pregnancy or lactation, maternal age <30 years vs 30-34 years, multiparity, caesarean section vs vaginal), household and environmental (having siblings, passive smoking, maternal asthma, daycare centre attendance), and health and medical conditions (any chronic diseases, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, HIV infections, congenital heart disease, Down syndrome, cystic fibrosis, previous asthma). The pooled ORs ranged from 1.14 to 4.55. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings on the risk factors for RSV-ALRI help identify RSV high-risk groups, which has important implications for RSV prevention at both individual and population levels.
38828798	Solid Lipid Nanoparticles for Pulmonary Delivery of Biopharmaceuticals: A Review of Opportunities, Challenges, and Delivery Applications.	Biopharmaceuticals such as nucleic acids, proteins, and peptides constitute a new array of treatment modalities for chronic ailments. Invasive routes remain the mainstay of administering biopharmaceuticals due to their labile nature in the biological environment. However, it is not preferred for long-term therapy due to the lack of patient adherence and clinical suitability. Therefore, alternative routes of administration are sought to utilize novel biopharmaceutical therapies to their utmost potential. Nanoparticle-mediated pulmonary delivery of biologics can facilitate both local and systemic disorders. Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) afford many opportunities as pulmonary carriers due to their physicochemical stability and ability to incorporate both hydrophilic and hydrophobic moieties, thus allowing novel combinatorial drug/gene therapies. These applications include pulmonary infections, lung cancer, and cystic fibrosis, while systemic delivery of biomolecules, like insulin, is also attractive for the treatment of chronic ailments. This Review explores physiological and particle-associated factors affecting pulmonary delivery of biopharmaceuticals. It compares the advantages and limitations of SLNs as pulmonary nanocarriers along with design improvements underway to overcome these limitations. Current research illustrating various SLN designs to deliver proteins, peptides, plasmids, oligonucleotides, siRNA, and mRNA is also summarized.
38997826	Role for DPP4 inhibitor therapy in cystic fibrosis related diabetes: A single centre experience.	INTRODUCTION: Insulin remains the only recommended medical treatment for cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD) Whilst there is an established role for orally bioavailable incretin mimetic agents such as the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4-I) in Type 2 diabetes mellitus, there exists little data on their utility in CFRD. AIM: To examine the use of DPP4-I therapy in patients with CFRD at a single large adult cystic fibrosis center. METHOD: People with CFRD prescribed a DPP4-I were identified from our specialist CFRD clinic and records were retrospectively examined for indication for therapy, tolerability and effectiveness. Analysis of continuous glucose monitoring data Libre 2 was done for these patients (CGM) pre and at least 3 months post therapy was performed. RESULTS: 23 people with CF (PwCF) with a mean (SD) age of 35.0 +- 2.4 years were included in this analysis . In 21 patients DPP4-I was prescribed as a monotherapy and it was given in combination with insulin in 2 others. Indications for therapy included reactive hypoglycaemia (n = 10) post prandial hyperglycaemia (8), insulin avoidance (3), metformin intolerance (1) and unclear (1). Therapy was well tolerated with no discontinuations due to adverse effects. Significant improvements were noted in Time in Range- Pre vs Post: 78.0 [67.5 - 84.0] vs 89.0 [79.8 - 96.0]%, p = 0.005, Time above Range -Pre vs Post: 19.5 [12.5 - 30.8] vs 6.0 [2.5 - 16.5]%, p = 0.006 and glucose variability Pre versus Post: 28.3 [25.4 - 31.1] vs 26.9 [23.1 - 31.3], p = 0.021, Of the 10 subjects who initiated therapy for hypoglycaemia, 7 reported an improvement in symptoms. No significant difference was found in weight pre and post: 61.5 +- 15.0 kg vs 62.5 +- 15.3 kg, p = 0.326 or Hba1c pre vs post: 41.0 [36.0 - 53.3] mmol/mol versus 40.5 [36.8 - 47.3], p = 0.727. CONCLUSION: DPP4-I is well tolerated in CFRD and can lead to an improved glycaemic control in these patients with significant improvement in validated CGM metrics.
39068533	Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy and resource utilization in patients with chronic pancreatitis in a US healthcare system: a retrospective study.	OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) and resource utilization among patients with chronic pancreatitis (CP) in a large Midwestern US healthcare system. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used electronic medical record data. Eligible patients (N = 2445) were aged >=18 years and diagnosed with non-cystic fibrosis CP between January 2005 and December 2018, with >=6 months' follow-up; study initiation was first encounter with the healthcare system. Patients in the PERT group were prescribed PERT at >=1 encounter; patients in the non-PERT group were not prescribed PERT at any encounter. RESULTS: In total, 62,899 encounters were reviewed (PERT, n = 22,935; non-PERT, n = 39,964). More patients in the PERT group were younger, male, White, married/partnered and with private insurance than those in the non-PERT group. They also received longer care and had more overall encounters, fewer outpatient and day surgery/24-hour observation encounters, and more inpatient encounters. Emergency room encounters were similar between groups. Average cost by encounter was similar between groups ($225 and $213, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Despite similar average costs per encounter, the groups had very different encounter types. More inferential research on PERT use among patients with CP is needed, particularly regarding resource utilization and long-term outcomes.
38729529	Inhaled antibiotics: A promising drug delivery strategies for efficient treatment of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) associated with antibiotic resistant biofilm-dwelling and intracellular bacterial pathogens.	Antibiotic-resistant bacteria associated with LRTIs are frequently associated with inefficient treatment outcomes. Antibiotic-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus, infections are strongly associated with pulmonary exacerbations and require frequent hospital admissions, usually following failed management in the community. These bacteria are difficult to treat as they demonstrate multiple adaptational mechanisms including biofilm formation to resist antibiotic threats. Currently, many patients with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF), non-CF bronchiectasis (NCFB) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) experience exacerbations of their lung disease and require high doses of systemically administered antibiotics to achieve meaningful clinical effects, but even with high systemic doses penetration of antibiotic into the site of infection within the lung is suboptimal. Pulmonary drug delivery technology that reliably deliver antibacterials directly into the infected cells of the lungs and penetrate bacterial biofilms to provide therapeutic doses with a greatly reduced risk of systemic adverse effects. Inhaled liposomal-packaged antibiotic with biofilm-dissolving drugs offer the opportunity for targeted, and highly effective antibacterial therapeutics in the lungs. Although the challenges with development of some inhaled antibiotics and their clinicals trials have been studied; however, only few inhaled products are available on market. This review addresses the current treatment challenges of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the lung with some clinical outcomes and provides future directions with innovative ideas on new inhaled formulations and delivery technology that promise enhanced killing of antibiotic-resistant biofilm-dwelling bacteria.
39187175	Impact of triple transmembrane regulator therapy on glucose metabolism in cystic fibrosis related diabetes during clinical practice.	AIMS: To evaluate the impact of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI) therapy on Cystic Fibrosis Related Diabetes (CFRD) glycemic control and insulin treatment in patients with CFRD during clinical practice METHODS: We carried out a retrospective observational study of 23 adult patients with CFRD who started treatment with ETI. They had, at least, one F508del mutation. Data were collected before ETI initiation and 3, 6, and 12 months after. RESULTS: Glycemic control measured by HbA1c significantly improved by 0.3 % (0.1-0.5) after 3 months of ETI therapy (p = 0.004) and kept this improvement during follow-up (p < 0.001). The proportion of patients needing multiple daily injections of insulin was reduced by 16 % (p = 0.023). Total daily insulin dose dropped by 0.12 (0.05-0.18) UI/kg/day (p < 0.001). Data derived from Flash Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) for patients treated with insulin stayed unchanged after insulin reduction, except for a significant 8 % (0.3-15.6) increase in the Time In Tight Range (TITR) between 70 and 140 mg/dL (p = 0.043). CONCLUSION: ETI therapy impacted CFRD in clinical practice reducing insulin needs and improving glycemic control measured by HbA1c and CGM. The improvements can be observed from the first 3 months of treatment.
38814300	Extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal for acute hypercapnic respiratory failure in a child with cystic fibrosis.	BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory failure is a prevalent condition in childhood with a high rate of mortality. Invasive mechanical ventilation support may be required for the management of these patients. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a method used when ventilation support is insufficient. However, the less invasive extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal method can be used as an alternative in cases of hypercapnic respiratory failure. CASE: A 9-year-old patient with cystic fibrosis presented to the hospital with acute respiratory failure due to pneumonia. Bilateral patchy areas of consolidation were evident in the chest x-ray. Invasive mechanical ventilation support was consequently provided to treat severe hypercapnia. Although peak and plateau pressure levels exceeded 32 cmH2O (49 cmH2O) and 28 cmH2O (35 cmH2O), respectively, the patient continued to have severe respiratory acidosis. Therefore extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal support was initiated to provide lung-protective ventilation. By Day 10, venovenous ECMO support was initiated due to deteriorating oxygenation. CONCLUSION: In cases where conventional invasive mechanical ventilation support is insufficient due to acute hypercapnic respiratory failure, extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal support, which is less invasive compared to ECMO, should be considered as an effective and reliable alternative method. However, it should be noted that extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal support does not affect oxygenation; it functions solely as a carbon dioxide removal system.
38966218	Efficacy of advanced hybrid closed loop systems in cystic fibrosis related diabetes: a pilot study.	Background and aims: Cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD) is correlated with worsening of nutritional status and greater deterioration of lung function. The role of new technologies for the treatment of CFRD is little explored. The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of Advanced Hybrid Closed Loop (AHCL) systems on glycemic control in CF patients. Methods: A single-center retrospective study on CFRD patients using AHCL systems was performed. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) values and Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) metrics were collected at T0 (AHCL placement), T1 (1-month), T2 (6-months) and T3 (1-year) to evaluate glycemic control. Results: 10 patients were included in the study. Data showed a reduction of HbA1c value (7.31 +- 0.34 to 6.35 +- 1.00; p=0.03), glycemic variability (p=0.05) and insulin requirement (p=0.03). The study population reached American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommended glycemic targets at 1-year. An increase in the Time in Range (TIR) and a reduction in time in hyperglycemia were also observed, although not statistically significant. Conclusions: In patients with CFRD, the use of AHCL leads to an improvement in glycemic control in terms of HbA1c and glycemic variability. The increase in TIR and the reduction of time in hyperglycemia, although not statistically significant, are extremely encouraging from a clinical point of view. Further studies with a larger population and a longer follow-up are needed. The results of this study demonstrate the importance of proposing the use of AHCL even in CF patients, who could benefit from glycemic improvement also in terms of nutritional status and respiratory function.
39051188	Cystic Fibrosis: Understanding Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Regulator Mutation Classification and Modulator Therapies.	A common life-threatening hereditary disease, Cystic Fibrosis (CF), affects primarily Caucasian infants. High sweat-salt levels are observed as a result of a single autosomal mutation in chromosome 7 that affects the critical function of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR). For establishing tailored treatment strategies, it is important to understand the broad range of CFTR mutations and their impacts on disease pathophysiology. This study thoroughly investigates the six main classes of classification of CFTR mutations based on their functional effects. Each class is distinguished by distinct molecular flaws, such as poor protein synthesis, misfolding, gating defects, conduction defects, and decreased CFTR expression at the apical membrane. Furthermore, this paper focuses on the emerging field of CFTR modulators, which intend to restore CFTR function or mitigate its consequences. These modulators, which are characterized by the mode of action and targeted mutation class, have the potential to provide personalized therapy regimens in CF patients. This review provides valuable insights into the genetic basis of CF pathology, and highlights the potential for precision medicine methods in CF therapy by thoroughly investigating CFTR mutation classification and related modulators.
39066214	Pseudomonas aeruginosa Bacteriophages and Their Clinical Applications.	Antimicrobial resistance poses a serious risk to contemporary healthcare since it reduces the number of bacterial illnesses that may be treated with antibiotics, particularly for patients with long-term conditions like cystic fibrosis (CF). People with a genetic predisposition to CF often have recurrent bacterial infections in their lungs due to a buildup of sticky mucus, necessitating long-term antibiotic treatment. Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections are a major cause of CF lung illness, and P. aeruginosa airway isolates are frequently resistant to many antibiotics. Bacteriophages (also known as phages), viruses that infect bacteria, are a viable substitute for antimicrobials to treat P. aeruginosa infections in individuals with CF. Here, we reviewed the utilization of P. aeruginosa bacteriophages both in vivo and in vitro, as well as in the treatment of illnesses and diseases, and the outcomes of the latter.
38522592	Prevalence and disparities in influenza vaccination among patients with COPD: A French nationwide population study.	INTRODUCTION: Despite concordant international recommendations, many surveys found disappointing rates of influenza vaccination in at-risk populations, ranging from 23% in overall COPD population to more than 70% in more severe COPD subjects. Therefore, we assessed the proportion of French COPD patients non-vaccinated for influenza and their clinical and socio-demographic factors. MATERIEL AND METHODS: This was a national retrospective study based on the French health insurance database. We identified "diagnosed COPD", defined as subjects hospitalized at least once in 2017 with a principal or associated diagnosis of COPD, and "suspected COPD" as those who were prescribed at least thrice long-acting bronchodilators (LAB), after exclusion of patients with a principal diagnosis or secondary associated diagnosis of asthma or cystic fibrosis, patients deceased before the influenza season and patients hospitalized in long-term or in palliative care unit. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the association between patients' characteristics and the lack of influenza vaccination. RESULTS: From the national database, 1 474 396 subjects were identified as "suspected COPD" of whom 528 114 were excluded because of previous diagnosis of asthma or cystic fibrosis, and 350 566 as "diagnosed COPD". Among the 1 296 848 patients included, 646 687 patients (53.3%) were vaccinated against influenza. Non-vaccinated subjects were significantly younger (62.1 vs 71.6 years old), more often women (47.9% vs 43.1%) and had fewer comorbidities assessed by Charlson's index (3.0 +- 2.2 vs 4.3 +- 2.1). Lack of vaccination was also associated with a lower LAB usage. Also, non-vaccinated subjects neither had severe exacerbation during the study period. Besides there was a significant heterogeneity in vaccination rate by geographic region, from 47% to 57%. In multivariate analysis, variables independently associated with the lack of influenza vaccination were female gender, younger age, fewer comorbidities and lower socio-economic level. CONCLUSIONS: This study using the French exhaustive health insurance database shows that influenza vaccination among COPD patients remains dramatically low and must become a high-priority public-health strategy.

38823086	Risk factors for COVID-19 hospitalisation after booster vaccination during the Omicron period: A French nationwide cohort study.	BACKGROUND: In spite of major effectiveness, a residual risk after COVID-19 primary vaccination was identified, in particular, for vulnerable individuals of advanced age or with comorbidities. Less is known about the Omicron period in people protected by a booster dose. We aimed to identify the characteristics associated with severe COVID-19 during the Omicron period in a population that had received a booster dose in France and to compare differences with the previous periods of the pandemic. METHODS: This study was carried out using the French national COVID-19 vaccination database (VAC-SI) coupled with the National Health Data System (SNDS). Individuals aged 12 years or over who received at least one booster dose were identified. Associations between socio-demographic and clinical characteristics and the risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation occurring at least 14 days after receiving a third dose of vaccine during the period of Omicron predominance, i.e., from 1 January 2022 to 10 November 2022, were assessed using Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for age, sex, time since booster dose and vaccination schedule. Analyses were performed overall and by sub-period of circulation of the strains BA.1, BA.2, and BA.4/BA.5, defined as periods where the main sub-variant accounted for more than 80 % of genotyped samples. FINDINGS: In total, 35,640,387 individuals received a booster dose (mean follow-up of 291 days) and 73,989 were hospitalised for COVID-19 during the total period. Older age (aHR 20.5 95 % CI [19.6-21.5] for 90 years of age or older versus 45-54 years of age), being male (aHR 1.52 [1.50-1.55]), and social deprivation (aHR 1.33 [1.30-1.37] for the most deprived areas versus the least deprived) were associated with an increased risk of hospitalisation for COVID-19. Most of the chronic diseases considered were also positively associated with a residual risk, in particular, cystic fibrosis (aHR 9.83 [7.68-12.56]), active lung cancer (aHR 3.26 [3.06-3.47]), chronic dialysis (aHR 3.79 [3.49-4.11]), psychological and neurodegenerative diseases (more markedly than during the periods of circulation of the alpha and delta variants), and organ transplantation. The use of immunosuppressants was also associated with an increased risk (aHR 2.24 [2.14-2.35], including oral corticosteroids aHR (2.58 [2.50-2.67]). CONCLUSION: Despite an effective booster and a generally less virulent circulating variant, a residual risk of severe COVID-19 still exists in vulnerable populations, especially those with neurological disorders.
39084837	New Therapies in Outpatient Pulmonary Medicine.	Newer medications and devices, as well as greater understanding of the benefits and limitations of existing treatments, have led to expanded treatment options for patients with lung disease. Treatment advances have led to improved outcomes for patients with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, pulmonary hypertension, and cystic fibrosis. The risks and benefits of available treatments are substantially variable within these heterogeneous disease groups. Defining the role of newer therapies mandates both an understanding of these disorders and overall treatment approaches. This section will review general treatment approaches in addition to focusing on newer therapies for these conditions..
38461123	Symptoms and quality of life in adults with cystic fibrosis: A cross-sectional analysis of the InSPIRe:CF trial.	BACKGROUND: People living with cystic fibrosis (CF) experience a high symptom burden. Due to the changing landscape of CF in the era of modulator therapy, we sought to examine the epidemiology of symptoms and their association with quality of life, to help CF clinicians improve symptom screening in clinic. METHODS: Using baseline data from a trial of specialist palliative care in adults with CF, we examined symptom prevalence, distress, and association with quality of life (measured with the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Total Score). RESULTS: Among 262 participants, median age was 33, and 78% were on modulator therapy. The most common symptoms were lack of energy (n = 194, 74%) and cough (190, 73%), whereas the most distressing were difficulty sleeping (range 0-4, mean 2.19, SD 1.15) and pain (mean 2.04, SD 1.1). The symptoms that impaired quality of life the most were extrapulmonary: lack of energy (average quality of life score -29.8, 95% CI -36.8 to -22.8), feeling sad (-29.8, 95% CI -35.6 to -23.9) and worrying (-28.7, 95% CI -34.9 to -22.5). CONCLUSIONS: The symptoms that were associated with the lowest quality of life were extrapulmonary. CF clinicians may consider screening for common symptoms that affect quality of life the most (lack of energy, worrying, difficulty sleeping, feeling irritable, pain, and shortness of breath). These symptoms may identify people living with CF who are most at risk for a decreased quality of life and may benefit from additional support.
38702073	Considerations for the use of inhaled antibiotics for Pseudomonas aeruginosa in people with cystic fibrosis receiving CFTR modulator therapy.	The major cause of mortality in people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) is progressive lung disease characterised by acute and chronic infections, the accumulation of mucus, airway inflammation, structural damage and pulmonary exacerbations. The prevalence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa rises rapidly in the teenage years, and this organism is the most common cause of chronic lung infection in adults with cystic fibrosis (CF). It is associated with an accelerated decline in lung function and premature death. New P. aeruginosa infections are treated with antibiotics to eradicate the organism, while chronic infections require long-term inhaled antibiotic therapy. The prevalence of P. aeruginosa infections has decreased in CF registries since the introduction of CF transmembrane conductance regulator modulators (CFTRm), but clinical observations suggest that chronic P. aeruginosa infections usually persist in patients receiving CFTRm. This indicates that pwCF may still need inhaled antibiotics in the CFTRm era to maintain long-term control of P. aeruginosa infections. Here, we provide an overview of the changing perceptions of P. aeruginosa infection management, including considerations on detection and treatment, the therapy burden associated with inhaled antibiotics and the potential effects of CFTRm on the lung microbiome. We conclude that updated guidance is required on the diagnosis and management of P. aeruginosa infection. In particular, we highlight a need for prospective studies to evaluate the consequences of stopping inhaled antibiotic therapy in pwCF who have chronic P. aeruginosa infection and are receiving CFTRm. This will help inform new guidelines on the use of antibiotics alongside CFTRm.

OBJECTIVES: In high-income countries hepatitis E virus (HEV) is an uncommonly diagnosed porcine-derived zoonoses. After identifying disproportionate chronic HEV infections in persons with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) postlung transplant, we sought to understand its epidemiology and potential drivers. DESIGN: All pwCF post-transplant attending our regional CF centre were screened for HEV. HEV prevalence was compared against non-transplanted pwCF and with all persons screened for suspected HEV infection from 2016 to 2022 in Alberta, Canada. Those with chronic HEV infection underwent genomic sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. Owing to their swine derivation, independently sourced pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) capsules were screened for HEV. RESULTS: HEV seropositivity was similar between transplanted and non-transplanted pwCF (6/29 (21%) vs 16/83 (19%); p=0.89). Relative to all other Albertans investigated for HEV as a cause of hepatitis (n=115/1079, 10.7%), pwCF had a twofold higher seropositivity relative risk and this was four times higher than the Canadian average. Only three chronic HEV infection cases were identified in all of Alberta, all in CF lung transplant recipients (n=3/29, 10.3%). Phylogenetics confirmed cases were unrelated porcine-derived HEV genotype 3a. Ninety-one per cent of pwCF were taking PERT (median 8760 capsules/person/year). HEV RNA was detected by RT-qPCR in 44% (47/107) of PERT capsules, and sequences clustered with chronic HEV cases. CONCLUSION: PwCF had disproportionate rates of HEV seropositivity, regardless of transplant status. Chronic HEV infection was evident only in CF transplant recipients. HEV may represent a significant risk for pwCF, particularly post-transplant. Studies to assess HEV incidence and prevalence in pwCF, and potential role of PERT are required.
38762388	Impact of interruption of CFTR modulator therapies.	Novel drug therapy targeting the defective cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein has the potential to significantly enhance the quality of life for numerous patients with cystic fibrosis. However, in some countries social insurance does not pay for modulators because these drugs are extremely expensive. This study sought to understand the impact on the health of children whose modulator treatments were interrupted because of legal procedures and delivery processes. Our study identified that the significant increase in percent-predicted forced expiratory volume levels (FEV1) and BMI z-score values associated with modulator therapies decreased sharply with their discontinuation. Significant worsening in FEV1, BMI z-scores, and BW z-scores were detected in the first follow-up visit after therapy discontinuation within 1 month. Eight patients had a reduction of FEV1 of more than 10%. The findings suggest that modulatory treatment continuation is important, and it is crucial that treatment is not interrupted.
38520101	[Therapeutics in cystic fibrosis: Clinical revolution and new challenges].	Over time, cystic fibrosis has become a model of synergy between research in pathophysiology and cell biology, and clinical advances. Therapies targeting the CFTR protein, in particular CFTR modulators, have transformed the prognosis of patients, bringing the hope of a normal life with the possibility of starting a family and growing old, challenging established statistics. However, patients are not yet cured, and side effects remain insufficiently documented. Epidemiological changes create new challenges for the management of cystic fibrosis. Approximately 10 % of patients still lack a therapeutic option. The community of researchers, pharmaceutical industries, patient associations, and health authorities remains committed to monitor the long-term effects of these still poorly characterised treatments, and to explore new pharmacological approaches, such as gene therapies.

38981171	Exercise intolerance, oxidative stress, and irisin in pediatric cystic fibrosis: Can telehealth-based exercise training make a difference?	BACKGROUND: Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) experience increased oxidative stress. Tele-exercise can be a new method to improve exercise in CF. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the effect of telehealth-based exercise training using different modalities (combined exercise training group, CombG, core stabilization exercise group, SG), in comparison with control group (CG), on exercise capacity, oxidative stress, and irisin in children with CF. METHODS: Thirty-nine children with CF (mean age=11.41+-2.18 years, mean FEV1(z-score)=-0.66+-1.96) were included in the study. The children were randomly allocated to groups. The CombG and SG performed core stabilization exercises (CS) 3 days per week for 8 weeks. The CombG also performed aerobic exercises 3 days per week in addition to CS. Physical activity (PA) recommendations were provided to the CG. Exercise capacity was evaluated using the Modified Shuttle Test (MST). Oxidative stress was assessed using total antioxidant status (TAS), total oxidant status (TOS), Oxidative Stress Index (OSI), malondialdehyde (MDA), and superoxide dismutase (SOD). The irisin level was also measured. RESULTS: Children's baseline sex, age, BMI, and FEV1 z-scores were similar (p > 0.05). The MST distance (p = 0.047,np2=0.157) and%MST distance (p = 0.045, np2=0.159) significantly improved in the CombG compared with the SG and CG. Although TAS and SOD decreased over time (p < 0.05), no significant changes were observed for TAS, TOS, OSI, MDA, SOD, and irisin parameters between the groups after training (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Combining aerobic exercise training with core stabilization applied using telehealth improved exercise capacity more than core stabilitation training only or PA recommendations in children with CF.
38490107	The application of the self-care deficit nursing theory in adolescents with cystic fibrosis: A randomized controlled study.	PURPOSE: The present study evaluates the effects of the application of Self-Care Deficit Nursing Theory (SCDNT) on the self-care knowledge and skills in adolescents with Cystic Fibrosis. DESIGN AND METHODS: This randomized controlled study included 30 adolescents who were equally divided into the intervention and control groups. The data were collected by using the Sociodemographic Data Form and the Self-Care Knowledge and Skills Evaluation Forms for Adolescents with Cystic Fibrosis. A total of seven home visits were conducted with the adolescents in the intervention group, during which individualized care plans were applied based on the Self-Care Deficit Nursing Theory. The self-care needs of the adolescents in the control group were identified based on data collected during two home visits conducted at the onset of the study and after 4.5 months. RESULTS: As a result of the application of nursing interventions based on the SCDNT, a statistically significant increase was noted in the self-care knowledge and skills of the adolescents in the intervention group (p < 0.05). Additionally, after the interventions based on SCDNT, the need of adolescents for nursing interventions decreased significantly over time in all adolescents in the intervention group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The application of nursing interventions based on the SCDNT was effective in enhancing the self-care knowledge and skills of adolescents with Cystic Fibrosis. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Nurses can benefit from Orem's Self-Care Deficit Nursing Theory in the design and application of the individualized care of adolescents with Cystic Fibrosis to improve their self-care practices.
39009289	Bacteriophages as potential antibiotic potentiators in cystic fibrosis: A new model to study the combination of antibiotics with a bacteriophage cocktail targeting dual species biofilms of Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.	Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa co-infections in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) are associated with disease severity. Their treatment is complicated by biofilm formation in the sticky mucus obstructing the airways. Using a dual species biofilm (P. aeruginosa/S. aureus) formed in artificial sputum medium, we investigated the activity of broad-spectrum antibiotics (meropenem, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, tobramycin) combined with a cocktail of two (bacterio)phages (PSP3 and ISP) proven active via spot tests and double agar on P. aeruginosa PAO1 and S. aureus ATCC 25923. At the highest tested concentrations (100 x MIC), antibiotics alone caused a 20-50% reduction in biomass and reduced S. aureus and P. aeruginosa CFU of 2.3 to 2.8 and 2.1 to 3.6 log10, respectively. Phages alone reduced biofilm biomass by 23% and reduced P. aeruginosa CFU of 2.1 log10, but did not affect S. aureus viability. Phages enhanced antibiotic effects on biomass and exhibited additive effects with antibiotics against P. aeruginosa, but not against S. aureus. Following inhibition of bacterial respiration by phages in planktonic cultures rationalized these observations by demonstrating that PSP3 was effective at multiplicities of infection (MOI) as low as 10-4 plaque forming units (PFU)/CFU on P. aeruginosa, but ISP, at higher MOI (> 0.1) against S. aureus. Thus, pre-screening inhibition of bacterial respiration by phages may assist in selecting those showing activity at sufficiently low titers to showcase anti-biofilm activity in this complex but clinically-relevant in vitro model of biofilm.
39182171	Kidney After Lung Transplants or Combined Kidney-Lung Transplantation: A Single-Center Retrospective Cohort Study.	BACKGROUND End-stage renal disease is a major issue in the management of patients undergoing lung transplantation. Combined kidney-lung transplantation (CKLT) and kidney after lung transplantation (KALT) are the 2 preferred solutions to manage this situation. To evaluate these strategies, we describe kidney and lung graft outcomes and patient survival in patients managed with CKLT and KALT. MATERIAL AND METHODS We conducted a retrospective single-center cohort study. Patients who underwent a CKLT or a KALT were included in this study. Retrospective extraction of data from medical records was performed. RESULTS Seventeen patients underwent CKLT and 9 underwent KALT. Most of the patients had cystic fibrosis and presented renal failure related to anti-calcineurin toxicity. The 30-day and 1-year survival of CKLT recipients were both 75.6%. No patients with KALT died during the follow-up. Kidney graft prognosis was almost exclusively influenced by patient survival in relation to postoperative lung transplant complications. The rate of severe surgical complications was close to 60% for CKLT compared with 30% for KALT. The kidney graft function (estimated kidney graft function) did not differ according to the transplantation strategy. CONCLUSIONS KALT is a safe option, with postoperative morbidity and renal graft function identical to those of kidney transplantation in non-lung-transplanted patients. The results of CKLT depend mainly on the morbidity associated with lung transplantation but remain an attractive option for patients with respiratory failure associated with end-stage renal disease. The choice of transplant strategy must also take into account the most ethical and efficient allocation of kidney grafts.
39092585	TMEM16 proteins: Ca2+-activated chloride channels and phospholipid scramblases as potential drug targets (Review).	TMEM16 proteins, which function as Ca2+-activated Cl- channels are involved in regulating a wide variety of cellular pathways and functions. The modulators of Cl- channels can be used for the molecule-based treatment of respiratory diseases, cystic fibrosis, tumors, cancer, osteoporosis and coronavirus disease 2019. The TMEM16 proteins link Ca2+ signaling, cellular electrical activity and lipid transport. Thus, deciphering these complex regulatory mechanisms may enable a more comprehensive understanding of the physiological functions of the TMEM16 proteins and assist in ascertaining the applicability of these proteins as potential pharmacological targets for the treatment of a range of diseases. The present review examined the structures, functions and characteristics of the different types of TMEM16 proteins, their association with the pathogenesis of various diseases and the applicability of TMEM16 modulator-based treatment methods.
38430625	Early glucose abnormalities revealed by continuous glucose monitoring associate with lung function decline in cystic fibrosis: A five-year prospective study.	BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD) is commonly associated with declining lung function and nutritional status. We aimed to evaluate the pulmonary impact of early glucose abnormalities by using 2-h standard oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in people with cystic fibrosis (PwCF). METHODS: PwCF aged >=10 years old without known CFRD were included in a five-year prospective multicentre study. Annual evaluation of nutritional status, lung function, OGTT and CGM was set up. Associations between annual rate changes (Delta) in lung function, DeltaFEV1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 s) percentage predicted (pp) and DeltaFVC (forced vital capacity) pp., and annual rate changes in OGTT or CGM variables were estimated with a mixed model with a random effect for subject. RESULTS: From 2009 to 2016, 112 PwCF (age: 21 +- 11 years, BMI (body mass index) z-score: -0.55 +- 1.09, FEV1pp: 77 +- 24 %, 2-h OGTT glucose: 122 +- 44 mg/dL, AUC (area under curve) >140 mg/dL: 1 mg/dL/day (0.2, 3.0) were included. A total of 428 OGTTs and 480 CGMs were collected. The participants presented annual decline of FVCpp and FEV1pp at -1.0 % per year (-1.6, -0.4), p < 0.001 and - 1.9 % per year (-2.5, -1.3), p < 0.001 respectively without change in BMI z-score during the study. Variation of two-hour OGTT glucose was not associated with declining lung function, as measured by DeltaFEV1pp (p = 0.94) and DeltaFVCpp (p = 0.90). Among CGM variables, only increase in AUC >140 mg/dL between two annual visits was associated with a decrease in DeltaFVCpp (p < 0.05) and DeltaFEV1pp (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This prospective study supports the fact that early glucose abnormalities revealed by CGM predict pulmonary function decline in PwCF, while 2-h standard OGTT glucose is not associated with pulmonary impairment.
38458615	Development of data processing algorithm to calculate adherence for adults with cystic fibrosis using inhaled therapy - a multi-center observational study within the CFHealthHub learning health system.	OBJECTIVES: To develop a robust algorithm to accurately calculate 'daily complete dose counts' for inhaled medicines, used in percent adherence calculations, from electronically-captured nebulizer data within the CFHealthHub Learning Health System. METHODS: A multi-center, cross-sectional study involved participants and clinicians reviewing real-world inhaled medicine usage records and triangulating them with objective nebulizer data to establish a consensus on 'daily complete dose counts.' An algorithm, which used only objective nebulizer data, was then developed using a derivation dataset and evaluated using internal validation dataset. The agreement and accuracy between the algorithm-derived and consensus-derived 'daily complete dose counts' was examined, with the consensus-derived count as the reference standard. RESULTS: Twelve people with CF participated. The algorithm derived a 'daily complete dose count' by screening out 'invalid' doses (those <60s in duration or run in cleaning mode), combining all doses starting within 120s of each other, and then screening out all doses with duration < 480s which were interrupted by power supply failure. The kappa co-efficient was 0.85 (0.71-0.91) in the derivation and 0.86 (0.77-0.94) in the validation dataset. CONCLUSIONS: The algorithm demonstrated strong agreement with the participant-clinician consensus, enhancing confidence in CFHealthHub data. Publishingdata processing methods can encourage trust in digital endpoints and serve as an exemplar for other projects.
38541202	The Role of Continuous Glucose Monitoring in Detecting Early Dysglycemia and Clinical Outcomes in Patients with Cystic Fibrosis.	Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) is the most common comorbidity in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). CFRD has been correlated with important clinical outcomes, including poor nutrition, reduced pulmonary function, and earlier mortality. However, clinical decline due to abnormalities of blood glucose (dysglycemia) begins early in CF, before the diagnosis of CFRD by the gold-standard oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) has been validated in patients with CF and has been recognized as a valuable tool in detecting early glucose abnormalities in patients with CF. Several CGM parameters have been used to predict CFRD in some but not all studies, and there is no consensus regarding CGM use for diagnostic purposes. Thus, it remains a complementary test to OGTT in CFRD diagnosis. The aim of this review is to provide an update on the pathophysiological mechanisms of CFRD, recent advances in the use of CGM for CFRD screening, and the association between CGM measures and CF-related clinical outcomes.
38640446	Liposomes for Inhalation.	Inhalation of liposomes formulated with phospholipids similar to endogenous lung surfactants and lipids offers biocompatibility and versatility within the pulmonary medicine field to treat a range of diseases such as lung cancer, cystic fibrosis and lung infections. Manipulation of the physicochemical properties of liposomes enables innovative design of the carrier to meet specific delivery, release and targeting requirements. This delivery system offers several benefits: improved pharmacokinetics with reduced toxicity, enhanced therapeutic efficacy, increased delivery of poorly soluble drugs, taste masking, biopharmaceutics degradation protection and targeted cellular therapy. This section provides an overview of liposomal formulation and delivery, together with their applications for different disease states in the lung.
38530204	Dual and triple modulator therapy for chronic rhinosinusitis in cystic fibrosis patients.	BACKGROUND: The introduction of CFTR modulators has changed the landscape in the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) and early case series have shown improvements in sinonasal outcomes in this patient population. METHODOLOGY: A real-word data study was performed to evaluate the impact of dual therapy with tezacaftor/ivacaftor (TEZ/IVA) and triple therapy with elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ELX/TEZ/IVA) on CF-related chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), by comparing subjective and objective outcome measures at baseline, 12 months after treatment with TEZ/IVA and six months after treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA. RESULTS: In total, 43 CF patients, with a mean age of 32 years, were included. After triple therapy, significant improvements in overall visual analogue scale, SNOT-22, Lund Kennedy, nasal polyps, and Lund-Mackay scores were observed, whereas no beneficial effect could be seen in patients treated with dual therapy. Bacterial upper airway colonization did not differ pre- and postmodulator therapy in the present study. The number of responders to dual and triple therapy is 23.8% and 63.2% of the patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Triple therapy with ELX/TEZ/IVA is superior to dual therapy with TEZ/IVA in the treatment of CF-CRS, as significantly reduced sinonasal complaints, nasal endoscopy and CT scores were observed after triple therapy, whereas this was not the case for dual therapy.
38697648	A randomized trial of oral prednisone for cystic fibrosis pulmonary exacerbation treatment.	BACKGROUND: Elevated markers of systemic and pulmonary inflammation are associated with failure to recover lung function following pulmonary exacerbations (PExs) in people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF). Our aim was to determine whether adjuvant oral prednisone treatment would improve recovery of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (ppFEV1) in CF PExs not responding to antibiotic therapy. METHODS: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in pwCF treated with intravenous (IV) antibiotics for a PEx. At Day 7, those who had not returned to >90% baseline ppFEV1 were randomized to adjuvant prednisone 1 mg kg-1 twice daily (max 60 mg/day) or placebo for 7 days. The primary outcome was the difference in proportion of subjects who recovered >90% baseline ppFEV1 at Day 14 of IV antibiotic therapy. RESULTS: 173 subjects were enrolled, with 76 randomized. 50% of subjects in the prednisone group recovered baseline FEV1 on Day 14 compared to 39% of subjects in the placebo group for a difference of 11% (95% CI -11, 34%, p=0.34). The mean (sd) change in ppFEV1 from Day 7 to Day 14 was 6.8% predicted (8.8) in the prednisone group and 4.6% (6.9) in the placebo group (mean difference 2.2% predicted 95% CI -1.5, 5.9%, p=0.24). Time to subsequent exacerbation was not prolonged in prednisone treated subjects (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.45, 1.53; p=0.54). CONCLUSIONS: This study failed to detect a difference in ppFEV1 recovery between adjuvant oral prednisone and placebo treatment in pwCF not responding at day 7 of IV antibiotic therapy for PExs.
38501345	Pancreatitis in cystic fibrosis: Presentation, medical and surgical management, and the impact of modulator therapies.	Patients with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) are at increased risk of acute (AP) and chronic (CP) pancreatitis, and their complications. The extent of remaining healthy pancreatic parenchyma determines the risk of developing future episodes of pancreatitis, as well as pancreatic exocrine or endocrine insufficiency. Pancreatitis may be the presenting symptom of CF, and genetic testing is especially important in pediatrics. AP and recurrent AP are managed with intravenous fluid hydration and pain control, in addition to early refeeding and treatment of complications. With the use of modulator therapy in CF, pancreatic function may be restored to some extent. CP related pain is managed with analgesics and neuromodulators, with surgery if indicated in specific situations including TPIAT as a possible type of surgical intervention. Long-term sequelae of CP in patients with CF include exocrine pancreatic insufficiency treated with pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies and associated metabolic complications such as bone disease/osteoporosis, pancreatogenic diabetes, and less commonly, pancreatic cancer. We review the presentation and etiologies of pancreatitis in CF patients as well as the management of AP and CP primarily in children.
38843911	ERS statement on transition of care in childhood interstitial lung diseases.	Interstitial lung diseases (ILD) are a heterogeneous group of rare diffuse diseases affecting the lung parenchyma in children and adults. Childhood interstitial lung diseases (chILD) are often diagnosed at very young age, affect the developing lung, and can have different presentations and prognosis compared to adult forms of these diseases. Also, chILD in many cases may apparently remit, and have a better response to therapy and better prognosis than adult ILD. Many affected children will reach adulthood with minimal activity or clinical remission of the disease. They need continuing care and follow-up from childhood to adulthood if the disease persists and progresses over time but also if they are asymptomatic and in full remission. Therefore, for every chILD patient an active transition process from paediatric to adult care should be guaranteed. This ERS statement provides a review of the literature and current practice concerning transition of care in chILD. It draws on work in existing transition care programs in other chronic respiratory diseases, disease-overarching transition of care programs, evidence on the impact of these programs on clinical outcomes, current evidence regarding long-term remission of chILD as well as the lack of harmonisation between the current adult ILD and chILD classifications impacting on transition of care. While the transition system is well established in several chronic diseases, such as cystic fibrosis or diabetes mellitus, we could not find sufficient published evidence on transition systems in chILD. This statement summarises current knowledge but cannot yet provide evidence-based recommendations for clinical practice.
39024368	In-silico discovery of common molecular signatures for which SARS-CoV-2 infections and lung diseases stimulate each other, and drug repurposing.	COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a global health issue. It is yet a severe risk factor to the patients, who are also suffering from one or more chronic diseases including different lung diseases. In this study, we explored common molecular signatures for which SARS-CoV-2 infections and different lung diseases stimulate each other, and associated candidate drug molecules. We identified both SARS-CoV-2 infections and different lung diseases (Asthma, Tuberculosis, Cystic Fibrosis, Pneumonia, Emphysema, Bronchitis, IPF, ILD, and COPD) causing top-ranked 11 shared genes (STAT1, TLR4, CXCL10, CCL2, JUN, DDX58, IRF7, ICAM1, MX2, IRF9 and ISG15) as the hub of the shared differentially expressed genes (hub-sDEGs). The gene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analyses of hub-sDEGs revealed some crucial common pathogenetic processes of SARS-CoV-2 infections and different lung diseases. The regulatory network analysis of hub-sDEGs detected top-ranked 6 TFs proteins and 6 micro RNAs as the key transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory factors of hub-sDEGs, respectively. Then we proposed hub-sDEGs guided top-ranked three repurposable drug molecules (Entrectinib, Imatinib, and Nilotinib), for the treatment against COVID-19 with different lung diseases. This recommendation is based on the results obtained from molecular docking analysis using the AutoDock Vina and GLIDE module of Schrodinger. The selected drug molecules were optimized through density functional theory (DFT) and observing their good chemical stability. Finally, we explored the binding stability of the highest-ranked receptor protein RELA with top-ordered three drugs (Entrectinib, Imatinib, and Nilotinib) through 100 ns molecular dynamic (MD) simulations with YASARA and Desmond module of Schrodinger and observed their consistent performance. Therefore, the findings of this study might be useful resources for the diagnosis and therapies of COVID-19 patients who are also suffering from one or more lung diseases.
38942720	Implementation and evaluation of a fertility preservation telehealth counseling intervention for males with cystic fibrosis.	BACKGROUND: Most males with cystic fibrosis (MwCF) have congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens and require assisted reproductive technology to conceive, yet many have limited knowledge about how CF affects sexual and reproductive health (SRH). This study evaluates the feasibility, acceptability, and potential effectiveness of telehealth fertility preservation (FP) counseling for MwCF. METHODS: Pre-lung transplant MwCF >=18 years, recruited from U.S. CF centers, social media, and via snowball sampling, received individualized telehealth counseling. Participants completed intervention feasibility/acceptability one week post-counseling and FP knowledge, care satisfaction, and self-efficacy assessments at baseline and two months post-counseling. We completed acceptability interviews one-week post-counseling and audio-recorded, transcribed, and thematically analyzed results. We descriptively analyzed survey results and conducted pre/post comparisons using paired t-tests. RESULTS: Thirty MwCF (ages 22-49 years) completed counseling. Most were in a relationship (70 %) and White (86.7 %). Telehealth FP counseling was acceptable (M = 4.38/5 +- 0.60), appropriate (M = 4.37/5 +- 0.60), and feasible (M = 4.60/5 +- 0.45) to MwCF. FP knowledge (9.53 vs. 10.40/12; p = .010), care satisfaction (20.23 vs 26.67/32; p<.001), and self-efficacy (22.87 vs 25.20/30; p = .016) improved at two months post-counseling. Despite desiring provider-initiated SRH, wanting children (81 %), and perceiving the CF team as their primary care provider (97 %), 44 % report not receiving information about infertility by the CF team. CONCLUSIONS: Integrating FP counseling into CF care is feasible and acceptable to MwCF and can improve FP knowledge, self-efficacy, and care satisfaction. MwCF desire early and regular provider-initiated SRH education.
39077931	High ionic strength vector formulations enhance gene transfer to airway epithelia.	A fundamental challenge for cystic fibrosis (CF) gene therapy is ensuring sufficient transduction of airway epithelia to achieve therapeutic correction. Hypertonic saline (HTS) is frequently administered to people with CF to enhance mucus clearance. HTS transiently disrupts epithelial cell tight junctions, but its ability to improve gene transfer has not been investigated. Here, we asked if increasing the concentration of NaCl enhances the transduction efficiency of three gene therapy vectors: adenovirus, AAV, and lentiviral vectors. Vectors formulated with 3-7% NaCl exhibited markedly increased transduction for all three platforms, leading to anion channel correction in primary cultures of human CF epithelial cells and enhanced gene transfer in mouse and pig airways in vivo. The mechanism of transduction enhancement involved tonicity but not osmolarity or pH. Formulating vectors with a high ionic strength solution is a simple strategy to greatly enhance efficacy and immediately improve preclinical or clinical applications.
38493301	Association of in-line digestive enzyme cartridge with enteral feeds on improvement in anthropometrics among pediatric patients with cystic fibrosis.	BACKGROUND: Approximately 85% of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) have exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) with 10% requiring supplemental nighttime enteral tube feedings. Administration of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) with nighttime feedings is fraught with challenges. RELiZORB (Alcresta Therapeutics, Inc), an in-line lipase cartridge, delivers PERT continuously with enteral feedings. Outcomes related to the use of this in-line lipase cartridge are lesser known. This project evaluated anthropometrics related to in-line lipase cartridge use among pediatric patients with CF already receiving oral PERT therapy prior to nighttime enteral feedings. METHODS: Retrospective chart review was performed on 29 patients with CF and EPI receiving supplemental tube feedings and utilizing in-line lipase cartridge for a continuous 12 month period between 2015 and 2019. Anthropometrics were evaluated 12 months before and after initiation of in-line lipase cartridge. RESULTS: Compared with mean height z score at 6-months pre-in-line lipase cartridge, mean height z score at 6-months post-in-line-lipase cartridge (adjusted mean difference [AMD] = 0.2540; 95% CI = [0.0487, 0.4592]; P = 0.0153) and mean height z score at 12-months post-in-line lipase cartridge (AMD = 0.2684; 95% CI = [0.0203, 0.5166]; P = 0.0340) were significantly higher. Mean weight z score at 12-months post-in-line-lipase-cartridge neared statistical significance compared with 6-months pre-in-line lipase cartridge (AMD = 0.2816; 95% CI = [-0.0003, 0.5634]; P = 0.0502) when excluding seven patients with advanced lung disease (forced expiratory volume in the first second of expiration of 40%). Weight-for-length or body mass index did not significantly differ compared with pre-in-line lipase cartridge. CONCLUSION: Use of in-line lipase cartridge with enteral feeds improved anthropometrics, especially height, in pediatric patients with CF.

38851921	Pharmacologic contraception methods for people with cystic fibrosis: A practical review for clinicians.	Over the last several decades, substantial treatment advances have improved the quality of life and median predicted survival in people with cystic fibrosis (PwCF). It is critical for CF clinicians to begin to discuss health considerations related to an aging and overall healthier CF population. Such considerations include family planning, reproductive health, and contraception. CF care teams are trusted sources of medical information and therefore often have initial discussions related to contraception for PwCF. The purpose of this article is to review the available pharmacologic contraceptive methods, with a specific focus on the benefits and risks that may be more relevant to PwCF.
