Health status and age are factors associated with dependency on, and the need for, someone else to take over self-care. In the present case, there was a self-care deficit. Cystic fibrosis is a chronic disease that occurs in one in 10,000 live births in Brazil, and the affected population in the country is predominantly pediatric (approximately 73%). Support from nursing teams is necessary to improve patients' skills until they can take full responsibility for their self-care. PURPOSE: This study aimed to identify self-care deficits based on reports from schoolchildren with cystic fibrosis. DESIGN AND METHOD: A qualitative study was conducted with eight Brazilian schoolchildren with cystic fibrosis, using an art-based technique during interviews. Minayo's thematic analysis was used for data analysis and interpretation. RESULTS: These results emerged from Orem's theory of self-care deficits and needs. A main theme labeled as universal self-care requisites was identified, and three subthemes were derived-maintenance of an adequate air supply; maintenance of a balance between activity and rest; and avoiding risks to life, bodily functions, and well-being. CONCLUSION: Schoolchildren living with cystic fibrosis have a negative attitude toward their disease, which makes it difficult for them to acquire the ability to care for themselves with greater autonomy. This leads to deficits in the self-care delivered by providers. IMPLICATIONS TO PRACTICE: It is necessary to recognize the deficits in self-care and the extent to which children living with cystic fibrosis depend on self-care providers. Families must be aware of these self-care deficits to develop holistic self-care abilities.",
