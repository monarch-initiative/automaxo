Treatment advances have led to improved outcomes for patients with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, pulmonary hypertension, and cystic fibrosis. The risks and benefits of available treatments are substantially variable within these heterogeneous disease groups. Defining the role of newer therapies mandates both an understanding of these disorders and overall treatment approaches. This section will review general treatment approaches in addition to focusing on newer therapies for these conditions..",
