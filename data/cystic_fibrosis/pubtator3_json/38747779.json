We analyzed the discourses of 19 social actors belonging to the community of specialists in cystic fibrosis, exploring the semantic meanings of the word \"precision\", and the barriers to diagnosis and innovations in therapeutics. We adopted the critical discourse analysis (CDA) of Norman Fairclough in order to achieve the discursive constructions around the integrality of care, the guarantee and equitable supply of basic social needs. Access was identified as an emic category when in the social arenas of dispute are health needs and the right to life.",
