DESIGN AND METHODS: This randomized controlled study included 30 adolescents who were equally divided into the intervention and control groups. The data were collected by using the Sociodemographic Data Form and the Self-Care Knowledge and Skills Evaluation Forms for Adolescents with Cystic Fibrosis. A total of seven home visits were conducted with the adolescents in the intervention group, during which individualized care plans were applied based on the Self-Care Deficit Nursing Theory. The self-care needs of the adolescents in the control group were identified based on data collected during two home visits conducted at the onset of the study and after 4.5 months. RESULTS: As a result of the application of nursing interventions based on the SCDNT, a statistically significant increase was noted in the self-care knowledge and skills of the adolescents in the intervention group (p < 0.05). Additionally, after the interventions based on SCDNT, the need of adolescents for nursing interventions decreased significantly over time in all adolescents in the intervention group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The application of nursing interventions based on the SCDNT was effective in enhancing the self-care knowledge and skills of adolescents with Cystic Fibrosis. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Nurses can benefit from Orem's Self-Care Deficit Nursing Theory in the design and application of the individualized care of adolescents with Cystic Fibrosis to improve their self-care practices.",
