                    "text": "Nutrition has played a central role in the management and outcomes of people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) since the 1970s. Advances in therapies and practices in recent decades have led to a significant change in the patient landscape with dramatic improvements in life expectancy, as well as quality of life, bringing with it new issues. Historically, cystic fibrosis was a condition associated with childhood and malnutrition; however, changes in patient demographics, nutritional assessment and fundamental nutritional management have evolved, and it has become an increasingly prevalent adult disease with new nutritional challenges, including obesity. This paper aims to describe these changes and the impact and challenges they bring for those working in this field. Nutritional professionals will need to evolve, adapt and remain agile to the wider range of situations and support required for a new generation of pwCF. Specialised nutrition support will continue to be required, and it will be additionally important to improve and optimise quality of life and long-term health.",
