It is critical for CF clinicians to begin to discuss health considerations related to an aging and overall healthier CF population. Such considerations include family planning, reproductive health, and contraception. CF care teams are trusted sources of medical information and therefore often have initial discussions related to contraception for PwCF. The purpose of this article is to review the available pharmacologic contraceptive methods, with a specific focus on the benefits and risks that may be more relevant to PwCF.",
