Invasive routes remain the mainstay of administering biopharmaceuticals due to their labile nature in the biological environment. However, it is not preferred for long-term therapy due to the lack of patient adherence and clinical suitability. Therefore, alternative routes of administration are sought to utilize novel biopharmaceutical therapies to their utmost potential. Nanoparticle-mediated pulmonary delivery of biologics can facilitate both local and systemic disorders. Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) afford many opportunities as pulmonary carriers due to their physicochemical stability and ability to incorporate both hydrophilic and hydrophobic moieties, thus allowing novel combinatorial drug/gene therapies. These applications include pulmonary infections, lung cancer, and cystic fibrosis, while systemic delivery of biomolecules, like insulin, is also attractive for the treatment of chronic ailments. This Review explores physiological and particle-associated factors affecting pulmonary delivery of biopharmaceuticals. It compares the advantages and limitations of SLNs as pulmonary nanocarriers along with design improvements underway to overcome these limitations. Current research illustrating various SLN designs to deliver proteins, peptides, plasmids, oligonucleotides, siRNA, and mRNA is also summarized.",
