CF-related diabetes (CFRD) is a unique form of diabetes that has distinctive features from both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Recent advances in diabetes technology may be of particular benefit in this population given the complex, multi-system organ involvement and challenging health issues that people with CFRD often face. This review summarises how diabetes technologies, such as continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) and insulin delivery devices: (1) have improved our understanding of CFRD, including how hyperglycaemia affects clinical outcomes in people with CF; (2) may be helpful in the screening and diagnosis of CFRD; and (3) offer promise for improving the management of CFRD and easing the burden that this diagnosis can add to an already medically complicated patient population.",
