input_text: Alloengraftment without significant toxicity or GVHD in CD45 antibody-drug
  conjugate conditioned Fanconi anemia mice. Fanconi anemia (FA) is an inherited DNA
  repair disorder characterized by bone marrow (BM) failure, developmental abnormalities,
  myelodysplasia, and leukemia and solid tumor predisposition. Allogeneic hematopoietic
  stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), a mainstay treatment, is limited by conditioning
  regimen-related toxicity and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Antibody-drug-conjugates
  (ADCs) targeting hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) can open marrow niches permitting
  donor stem cell alloengraftment. Here, we report that single dose anti-mouse CD45-targeted-ADC
  (CD45-ADC) facilitated stable, multilineage chimerism in 3 distinct FA mouse models
  representing 90% of FA complementation groups. CD45-ADC profoundly depleted host
  stem cell enriched Lineage Sca1+cKit+ cells within 48 hours. Fanca-/- recipients
  of minor-mismatched BM and single dose CD45-ADC had peripheral blood (PB) mean donor
  chimerism >90%; donor HSCs alloengraftment was verified in secondary recipients.
  In Fancc-/- and Fancg-/- recipients of fully allogeneic grafts, PB mean donor chimerism
  was 60-80% and 70-80%, respectively. The mean percent donor chimerism in BM and
  spleen mirrored PB results. CD45-ADC conditioned mice did not have clinical toxicity.
  A transient <2.5-fold increase in hepatocellular enzymes and mild-to-moderate histopathological
  changes were seen. Under GVHD allo-HSCT conditions, wildtype and Fanca-/- recipients
  of CD45-ADC had markedly reduced GVHD lethality compared to lethal irradiation.
  Moreover, single dose anti-human CD45-ADC given to rhesus macaque nonhuman primates
  on days -6 or -10 was at least as myeloablative as lethal irradiation. These data
  suggest that CD45-ADC can potently promote donor alloengraftment and hematopoiesis
  without significant toxicity or severe GVHD, as seen with lethal irradiation, providing
  strong support for clinical trial considerations in highly vulnerable FA patients.
