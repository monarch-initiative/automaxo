input_text: 'Fanconi anemia and haploidentical stem cell transplantation. BACKGROUND:
  Fanconi anemia is a congenital disorder belonging to bone marrow syndromes, with
  a risk of developing malignancy. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the
  only curative treatment in these cases. Here, we aimed to report our clinical experience
  in pediatric patients with Fanconi anemia treated with haploidentical stem cell
  transplantation and post-transplant cyclophosphamide, an alternative strategy. METHODS:
  We performed a case report based on clinical records of two patients who signed
  the informed consent form and were treated at Fundacion Valle del Lili. RESULT:
  Two pediatric patients, both with reduced-intensity conditioning, prophylaxis for
  acute graft-versus-host disease with post-transplant cyclophosphamide. They achieved
  primary neutrophil/platelets engraftment, and 100% chimerism. Had grade I or II
  graft-versus-host disease resolved? Currently are alive and in complete remission.
  CONCLUSIONS: The use of mismatched related donors for haploidentical stem cell transplantation
  and post-transplant cyclophosphamide might be a promising option, and well-tolerated
  in pediatric patients. Serial chimerism can be useful during follow-up.'
