input_text: 'Kidney complications in 107 Fanconi anemia patients submitted to hematopoietic
  cell transplantation. Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare disease characterized by progressive
  bone marrow failure, cancer predisposition, and multiple systemic malformations,
  including congenital abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT). Hematopoietic
  cell transplantation (HCT), the only potentially curative treatment for the hematological
  complications of FA, may precipitate acute kidney injury (AKI) and hypertension.
  We retrospectively investigated 107 FA patients who underwent HCT between 2009 and
  2017. We investigated the incidence and risk factors of AKI within 100 days after
  HCT in a cohort of FA patients, and kidney function and hypertension over 2-year
  follow-up.The incidence of AKI (mainly stage I) was 18.7%. Patients aged >= 11 years
  at transplantation showed a higher risk of AKI (OR 3.53). The eGFR was 60-90 mL/min/1.73
  m2 in 53 (49.5%), 55 (51.4%), 50 (50.5%), 50 (51%), and 46 (59.7%) patients before
  HCT, at 100 days, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years. Within the first 100 days after
  HCT, hypertension was observed in 72% of the patients and was associated with cyclosporine
  therapy. Most (62.3%) patients had stage 2 hypertension. CAKUT was observed in 33.7%
  of the patients and was associated with both hypertension (86%) and diminished kidney
  function but not with AKI.Conlusion: Although AKI, a commonly known HCT complication,
  was mild in this study, the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD), as well
  as the high incidence of hypertension, specially associated with CAKUT point out
  the importance of kidney care in short and long-term follow up of FA patients. What
  is Known:   Fanconi anemia (FA) is the most frequent inherited bone marrow failure
  in children, and 30% of cases have congenital anomalies of kidney (CAKUT).   Acute
  kidney injury and hypertension after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) may
  impact the outcomes.. What is New:   Despite the presence of CAKUT and stage 2 CKD
  in 33.7% and 50% of the patients, respectively, AKI was mild and transitory after
  HCT in FA patients.   CAKUT in FA patients was associated with lower kidney function
  and hypertension after HCT.'
