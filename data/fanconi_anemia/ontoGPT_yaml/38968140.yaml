input_text: Outcome of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation in 813 Pediatric Patients
  with Fanconi Anemia. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is
  the only established curative option for Fanconi anemia (FA) associated bone marrow
  failure (BMF)/aplastic anemia (AA) and hematological malignancy. We performed a
  retrospective multicenter study on 813 FA children undergoing first HSCT between
  2010 and 2018. Median duration of follow-up was 3.7 years (interquartile range,
  3.4-4.0). Median age at transplant was 8.8 years (6.5-18.1). Overall survival (OS),
  event-free survival (EFS) and GvHD-free, relapse-free survival (GRFS) at 5 years
  were 83% (80-86%), 78% (75-81%) and 70% (67-74%) respectively. OS was comparable
  between matched family donor (MFD, n=441, 88%) and matched unrelated donor (MUD,
  n=162, 86%) and was superior to that of mismatched family or unrelated donor (MMFD/MMUD,
  n=144, 72%) and haploidentical donor (HID) (n=66, 70%, p<0.001). In multivariable
  analysis, a transplant indication of acute myeloid leukaemia/myelodysplastic syndrome
  compared to AA/BMF, use of MMFD/MMUD and HID compared to MFD, Fludarabine-Cyclophosphamide
  (FluCy) + other conditioning compared to FluCy independently predicted inferior
  OS, while alemtuzumab compared to ATG was associated with better OS. Age   10 years
  was associated with worse EFS and GRFS. Cumulative incidences (CIN) of primary and
  secondary graft failure were 2% (1-3%) and 3% (2-4%) respectively. CIN of grade
  II-IV acute GvHD, grade III-IV acute GvHD and chronic GvHD were 23% (20-26%), 12%
  (10-15%) and 8% (6-10%) respectively. The 5-year CIN of secondary malignancy was
  2% (1-3%). These data suggest that HSCT should be offered to Fanconi Anemia patients
  with AA/BMF at a younger age in the presence of a well-matched donor.
