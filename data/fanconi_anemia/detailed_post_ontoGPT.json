Thus, management of this multisystem disorder has previously been unfamiliar to many hematologists specializing in the care of adolescents and young adults (AYA). The increased diagnosis of FA in AYA patients, facilitated by widely available germline genomic testing, improved long-term survival of children with FA following matched sibling and alternative donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) performed for BMF, and expanding need in the near future for long-term monitoring in patients achieving hematologic stabilization following ex vivo gene therapy are all reasons why management of FA in AYA populations deserves specific consideration. In this review, we address the unique challenges and evidence-based practice recommendations for the management of AYA patients with FA. Specific topics addressed include hematologic monitoring in AYA patients yet to undergo HSCT, management of myeloid malignancies occurring in FA, diagnosis and management of nonhematologic malignances and organ dysfunction in AYA patients with FA, and evolving considerations for the long-term monitoring of patients with FA undergoing gene therapy.",

                    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare genetic syndrome characterized by increased chromosomal breakage, congenital anomalies, bone marrow failure and an increased tendency to develop malignancies. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative treatment for bone marrow failure and the hematologic malignancies these patients develop. Given the sensitivity of FA patients to chemotherapy and radiation, as to the clinical symptoms of graft versus host disease (GvHD), HSCT in these patients is challenging. Since the mid-nineties, HSCT for FA patients is performed in our center by using the fludarabine based reduced-intensity protocol. AIMS: To summarize the results of HSCT for patients with FA using a fludarabine based reduced-intensity conditioning regimen at the Hadassah Medical Center. METHODS: This retrospective research is based on the collection and analysis of clinical and laboratory data from the medical records of patients. RESULTS: Since June 1996 up till February 2020, 39 patients with FA underwent 43 HSCTs with a fludarabine based protocol at the Hadassah Medical Center. Four patients required a second transplant due to primary engraftment failure. Nine patients (23%) suffered from acute GvHD, four of them severe. Eight patients (20%) developed chronic GvHD, two with an extensive and debilitating disease. Thirty-three (85%) of the patients survived and six died, five shortly after the transplant, and one twenty years later from malignancy. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show high survival rates with low rates of engraftment failure and reasonable rates of GvHD. DISCUSSION: As of today, there is an effective and safe treatment for patients with FA who require HSCT by using a fludarabine-based reduced-intensity conditioning regimen, with high survival rates and few complications.",

Over the last two decades, HSCT outcomes have improved dramatically following the development of regimens tailored for FA patients. In this study, we analyzed genetic, clinical, and transplant data of 41 patients with FA who underwent HSCT at Hadassah Medical Center between November 1996 and September 2020. Overall survival (OS) was 82.9% with a median follow-up time of 2.11-years (95% CI, .48-16.56). Thirteen patients (31.7%) developed acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), three of them with grades 3-4. Nine patients developed chronic GVHD, five had extensive disease. Twelve patients (29.3%) developed stable mixed-chimerism with complete resolution of bone marrow failure (BMF); none of them had acute nor chronic GVHD. Significantly higher GVHD rates were observed in transplants from peripheral blood stem cell grafts as compared to other stem cell sources (p = .002 for acute and p = .004 for chronic GVHD). Outcome parameters were comparable between HSCT from matched-sibling (n = 20) to other donors (n = 21), including survival rates (p = .1), time to engraftment (p = .69 and p = .14 for neutrophil and platelet engraftment time, respectively), chimerism status (p = .36 and p = .83 for full-donor and mixed chimerism, respectively), and GVHD prevalence (p = 1). Our results demonstrate the vast improvements in HSCT outcomes of patients with FA, narrowing the gap between matched-sibling versus alternative donor transplantations. Our data identifies factors that may significantly affect transplant outcomes such as graft source and chimerism status.",

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) represents the only therapeutic option to restore normal hematopoiesis after the occurrence of marrow failure or clonal hematopoietic abnormality. However, radiation exposure during transplant may increase the risk of later malignancies. In this retrospective study, we analyzed the results of HSCT with a radiation-free, busulfan-based conditioning regimen in FA patients. A total of 122 patients (median age: 8 years, range: 2-18 years) with FA who underwent HSCT between January 2008 and January 2020 were enrolled in this study and followed up to the end of 2020. The preparative regimen included busulfan (0.2 mg/kg/day, days -9 to -6), cyclophosphamide (15 mg/kg/day, days -5 to -2), and in vivo T-cell depletion with rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin. All patients received graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis with cyclosporine combined with methotrexate. We used the Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test, and Cox proportional hazards models to analyze patient survival. Peripheral blood, bone marrow and cord blood hematopoietic stem cells were used in 84 (68.9%), 31 (25.4%) and 7 (5.7%) patients, respectively. Donors were matched siblings in 48 (39.3%), matched other relatives in 56 (45.9%), and matched unrelated persons in 18 (14.8%) patients. With a median follow-up time of 24.25 months, graft rejection occurred in only one patient. The 1- and 5-year overall survival rates were 84.14% (95% confidence interval: 76.02-89.70) and 82.16% (95% confidence interval: 73.01-88.45), respectively. Of the patient characteristics documented before transplant, the presence of cardiopulmonary, genitourinary tract, central nervous system, and limb malformations significantly affected survival rates. Our results indicate excellent outcomes in patients with FA undergoing HSCT with a radiation-free, busulfan-based conditioning regimen. It would be desirable to aim at optimizing the outcome of HSCT in FA patients in future studies.",

Cumulative incidence of grades II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was 29% and 11% for chronic GVHD. Median follow-up after HSCT was 6.5 years. Seven patients (21%) died due to transplant-related causes, two (6%) because of MDS relapse, and one (3%) after a squamous cell carcinoma.

OBJECTIVE: To report a case series of patients diagnosed with FA with oral SCC. METHOD: Included in this case series are six patients diagnosed with SCC in the buccal mucosa with similar clinical characteristics. FINAL CONSIDERATIONS: There are still difficulties in establishing the natural history of oral lesions in patients with FA.

While several nontransplant treatments are currently under evaluation, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains the only therapeutic option for bone marrow failure (BMF). Although HSCT outcomes in patients with FA have remarkably improved over the past 20 years, in addition to the mortality intrinsic to the procedure, HSCT increases the risk and accelerates the appearance of late malignancies. HSCT offers the best outcome when performed in optimal conditions (moderate cytopenia shifting to severe, prior to transfusion dependence and before clonal evolution or myelodysplasia/acute myeloid leukemia); hence, an accurate surveillance program is vital. Haploidentical HSCT offers very good outcomes, although long-term effects on malignancies have not been fully explored. A monitoring plan is also important to identify cancers, particularly head and neck carcinomas, in very early phases. Gene therapy is still experimental and offers the most encouraging results when performed in early phases of BMF by infusing high numbers of corrected cells without genotoxic effects. Patients with FA need comprehensive monitoring and care plans, coordinated by centers with expertise in FA management, that start at diagnosis and continue throughout life. Such long-term follow-up is essential to detect complications related to the disease or treatment in this setting.",

Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed in chimeric populations of corrected and uncorrected HSPCs coexisting in the BM of gene therapy treated FA patients. Our study demonstrates that gene therapy reverts the transcriptional signature of FA HSPCs, which then resembles the transcriptional program of healthy donor HSPCs. This includes a downregulated expression of TGF-beta and p21, typically upregulated in FA HSPCs, and upregulation of DNA damage response and telomere maintenance pathways. Our results show for the first time the potential of gene therapy to rescue defects in the HSPC transcriptional program from patients with inherited diseases, in this case in FA characterized by BMF and cancer predisposition.",

                    "abstract": "High-dose chemotherapy with melphalan followed by autologous transplantation is a first-line treatment for multiple myeloma. Here, we present preclinical evidence that this treatment may be significantly improved by the addition of exportin 1 inhibitors (XPO1i). The XPO1i selinexor, eltanexor, and KOS-2464 sensitized human multiple myeloma cells to melphalan. Human 8226 and U266 multiple myeloma cell lines and melphalan-resistant cell lines (8226-LR5 and U266-LR6) were highly sensitized to melphalan by XPO1i. Multiple myeloma cells from newly diagnosed and relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients were also sensitized by XPO1i to melphalan. In NOD/SCIDgamma mice challenged with either parental 8226 or U266 multiple myeloma and melphalan-resistant multiple myeloma tumors, XPO1i/melphalan combination treatments demonstrated stronger synergistic antitumor effects than single-agent melphalan with minimal toxicity. Synergistic cell death resulted from increased XPO1i/melphalan-induced DNA damage in a dose-dependent manner and decreased DNA repair. In addition, repair of melphalan-induced DNA damage was inhibited by selinexor, which decreased melphalan-induced monoubiquitination of FANCD2 in multiple myeloma cells. Knockdown of FANCD2 was found to replicate the effect of selinexor when used with melphalan, increasing DNA damage (gammaH2AX) by inhibiting DNA repair. Thus, combination therapies that include selinexor or eltanexor with melphalan may have the potential to improve treatment outcomes of multiple myeloma in melphalan-resistant and newly diagnosed patients. The combination of selinexor and melphalan is currently being investigated in the context of high-dose chemotherapy and autologous transplant (NCT02780609). SIGNIFICANCE: Inhibition of exportin 1 with selinexor synergistically sensitizes human multiple myeloma to melphalan by inhibiting Fanconi anemia pathway-mediated DNA repair.",

We report the case of a patient with advanced gastric cancer, Fanconi anemia (FA), and primary biliary cholangitis. A 26-year-old woman visited a local physician complaining of epigastralgia. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed edematous changes with poor distension and circumferential thickened folds with erosions in the gastric body. Biopsy results of the lesion specimens revealed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed gastric wall with irregular thickness, several nodules in the peritoneal cavity, and a mass lesion in the right ovary. We diagnosed the patient with T4N2M1 stage IV gastric cancer accompanied by peritoneal and ovarian metastases and initiated nivolumab with S-1 plus oxaliplatin as the first-line treatment regimen. Because of immune-related adverse events after one course of systemic treatment, the regimen was changed to ramucirumab combined with nab-paclitaxel chemotherapy as the second-line treatment. After three cycles of weekly nab-paclitaxel with ramucirumab, the decreased platelet count did not recover, and her general condition gradually deteriorated. Comprehensive genome profiling using next-generation sequencing was performed to determine the feasibility of genotype-matched therapies. Alterations in FA complementation group A (FANCA) F1263del (49.1%) and E484Q (12.3%), which encode a key component of the multiprotein FA complex, were identified. The patient died 10 months after treatment initiation. In conclusion, when treating malignancies in adolescent and young adult patients, the genomic background should be considered.",

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), a mainstay treatment, is limited by conditioning regimen-related toxicity and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Antibody-drug-conjugates (ADCs) targeting hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) can open marrow niches permitting donor stem cell alloengraftment. Here, we report that single dose anti-mouse CD45-targeted-ADC (CD45-ADC) facilitated stable, multilineage chimerism in 3 distinct FA mouse models representing 90% of FA complementation groups. CD45-ADC profoundly depleted host stem cell enriched Lineage Sca1+cKit+ cells within 48 hours. Fanca-/- recipients of minor-mismatched BM and single dose CD45-ADC had peripheral blood (PB) mean donor chimerism >90%; donor HSCs alloengraftment was verified in secondary recipients. In Fancc-/- and Fancg-/- recipients of fully allogeneic grafts, PB mean donor chimerism was 60-80% and 70-80%, respectively. The mean percent donor chimerism in BM and spleen mirrored PB results. CD45-ADC conditioned mice did not have clinical toxicity. A transient <2.5-fold increase in hepatocellular enzymes and mild-to-moderate histopathological changes were seen. Under GVHD allo-HSCT conditions, wildtype and Fanca-/- recipients of CD45-ADC had markedly reduced GVHD lethality compared to lethal irradiation. Moreover, single dose anti-human CD45-ADC given to rhesus macaque nonhuman primates on days -6 or -10 was at least as myeloablative as lethal irradiation. These data suggest that CD45-ADC can potently promote donor alloengraftment and hematopoiesis without significant toxicity or severe GVHD, as seen with lethal irradiation, providing strong support for clinical trial considerations in highly vulnerable FA patients.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Outcome of children with medulloblastoma (MB) and Fanconi Anemia (FA), an inherited DNA repair deficiency, has not been described systematically. Treatment is complicated by high vulnerability to treatment-associated side effects, yet structured data are lacking. This study aims at giving a comprehensive overview about clinical and molecular characteristics of pediatric FA MB patients. METHODS: Clinical data including detailed information on treatment and toxicities of six previously unreported FA MB patients were supplemented with data of 16 published cases. RESULTS: We identified 22 cases of children with FA and MB with clinical data available. All MBs with subgroup reporting were SHH-activated (n=9), confirmed by methylation profiling in five patients. FA MB patients exclusively belonged to complementation groups FA-D1 (n=16) or FA-N (n=3). Patients were treated with postoperative chemotherapy only (50%) or radiotherapy (RT)+-chemotherapy (27%). 23% did not receive adjuvant therapy. Excessive treatment-related toxicities were frequent. Severe hematological toxicity occurred in 91% of patients treated with alkylating chemotherapy, while non-alkylating agents and RT were less toxic. Median overall survival (OS) was 1 year (95%CI 0.3-1.8). 1-year-progression-free-survival (PFS) was 26.3+-10.1% and 1-year-OS was 42.1+-11.3%. Adjuvant therapy prolonged survival (1y-OS/1y-PFS 0%/0% without adjuvant therapy vs. 53.3+-12.9%/33.3+-12.2% with adjuvant therapy, p=0.006/p=0.086). CONCLUSIONS: MB in FA patients is strongly associated with SHH activation and FA-D1/FA-N. Despite the dismal prognosis, adjuvant therapy may prolong survival. Non-alkylating chemotherapy and RT are feasible in selected patients with careful monitoring of toxicities and dose adjustments. Curative therapy for FA MB-SHH remains an unmet medical need.",

An alternative donor was used in 119 (73%) patients, and 160 (98%) patients received a non-T-cell-depleted graft. With an 8.7-year median follow-up, 5-year overall survival (OS) was 81%. The 5-year OS was significantly higher in AA patients than in MDS and acute leukemia patients (89%, 71%, and 44%, respectively). In the MDS/leukemia group, factors associated with poor outcome in univariate analysis were older age at HSCT (>= 18 years), conditioning regimen without anti-thymocyte or lymphocyte globulin, and grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease. After 1 year, of 137 survivors, 15 developed subsequent malignancies, of whom 12 were diagnosed with head and neck (HN)/esophageal cancer. An irradiation regimen and older age were associated with the risk of HN/esophageal cancer. Five of seven deaths were attributed to subsequent malignancies more than 5 years after HSCT. On the basis of the risk factors for HSCT in MDS/leukemia patients and subsequent malignancies, a more effective HSCT approach is required.",

OBJECTIVES: To describe outcomes, with a special focus on late complications, in FA patients who underwent umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT). STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of allogeneic UCBT for FA performed between 1988 and 2021 in European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) affiliated centers. RESULTS: A total of 205 FA patients underwent UCBT (55 related and 150 unrelated) across 77 transplant centers. Indications for UCBT were bone marrow failure in 190 patients and acute leukemia/myelodysplasia in 15 patients. Median age at transplant was 9 (1.2-43) years, with only 20 patients over the age of 18. Among the donor-recipient pairs, 56% (n=116) had 0-1/6 HLA mismatch. Limited field radiotherapy was administered to 28% (n=58) and 78% (n=160) received a Fludarabine (FLU)-based conditioning regimen. Serotherapy consisted of anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG, n=159; 78%) or alemtuzumab (n=12; 6%). Median follow-up was 10 years for related and 7 years for unrelated UCBT. Excellent outcomes were observed in the setting of related UCBT, including a 60-day cumulative incidence (CI) of neutrophil recovery at 98.1% (93.9-100), a 100-day CI of grades II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) at 17.3% (9.5-31.6), and a 5-year CI of chronic GVHD at 22.7% (13.3-38.7; 13% extensive). Five-year overall survival (OS) was 88%. In multivariate analysis, none of the factors included in the model predicted a better OS. In unrelated UCBT, the 60-day CI of neutrophil recovery was 78.7% (71.9-86.3), the 100-day CI of grade II-IV aGVHD was 31.4% (24.6-40.2) and the 5-year CI of cGVHD was 24.3% (17.8-32.2) (12% extensive). Five-year OS was 44%. In multivariate analysis, negative recipient CMV serology, FLU-based conditioning, age at UCBT less than 9 years and 0-1/6 HLA mismatch were associated with improved OS. A total of 106 patients, including 5 AL/MDS, survived for over 2 years after UCBT. Nine of these patients developed subsequent neoplasms (SN), including one donor-derived AML and 8 solid tumors, at a median of 9.7 (2.3-21.8) years post-UCBT (one related and 8 unrelated UCBT). In a subset of 49 patients with available data, late non-malignant complications affecting various organ systems were observed at a median of 8.7 (2.7-28.8) years post-UCBT. CONCLUSION: UCB is a valid source of stem cells for transplantation in patients with FA, with best results observed after related UCBT. After unrelated UCBT, improved survival was observed in patients transplanted at a younger age, with FLU-based conditioning and better HLA parity. The incidence of organ specific complications and subsequent neoplasms was relatively low. Subsequent neoplasm incidence, mostly squamous cell carcinoma, increases with time. Rigorous follow-up and life-long screening is crucial in Fanconi anemia patients transplant survivors. The long-term complications observed emphasize the need for long-life screening of transplant survivors.",

                    "abstract": "Fanconi anemia (FA) is an inherited DNA repair disorder characterized by bone marrow (BM) failure, developmental abnormalities, myelodysplasia, and leukemia and solid tumor predisposition. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), a mainstay treatment, is limited by conditioning regimen-related toxicity and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Antibody-drug-conjugates (ADCs) targeting hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) can open marrow niches permitting donor stem cell alloengraftment. Here, we report that single dose anti-mouse CD45-targeted-ADC (CD45-ADC) facilitated stable, multilineage chimerism in 3 distinct FA mouse models representing 90% of FA complementation groups. CD45-ADC profoundly depleted host stem cell enriched Lineage Sca1+cKit+ cells within 48 hours. Fanca-/- recipients of minor-mismatched BM and single dose CD45-ADC had peripheral blood (PB) mean donor chimerism >90%; donor HSCs alloengraftment was verified in secondary recipients. In Fancc-/- and Fancg-/- recipients of fully allogeneic grafts, PB mean donor chimerism was 60-80% and 70-80%, respectively. The mean percent donor chimerism in BM and spleen mirrored PB results. CD45-ADC conditioned mice did not have clinical toxicity. A transient <2.5-fold increase in hepatocellular enzymes and mild-to-moderate histopathological changes were seen. Under GVHD allo-HSCT conditions, wildtype and Fanca-/- recipients of CD45-ADC had markedly reduced GVHD lethality compared to lethal irradiation. Moreover, single dose anti-human CD45-ADC given to rhesus macaque nonhuman primates on days -6 or -10 was at least as myeloablative as lethal irradiation. These data suggest that CD45-ADC can potently promote donor alloengraftment and hematopoiesis without significant toxicity or severe GVHD, as seen with lethal irradiation, providing strong support for clinical trial considerations in highly vulnerable FA patients.",

We have studied a large population of FA patients who underwent allogeneic HCT at our institution and report here the outcome according to chimerism status. Patients with FA who had evidence of progressive bone marrow failure and were blood products-transfusion dependent (packed red blood cells, platelets, or both) were included in the study. Those who had myelodysplasia (MDS) or an abnormal clone or evidence of leukemia were excluded. All but 3 patients had normal renal and cardiac function at the time of transplantation. In total, 160 patients with FA underwent allogeneic HCT at our center from January 1995 to December 2017; mean age at HCT was 8.4. Chimerism data at last follow-up visit were available on 97 patients who are the subjects of this analysis (no day +100 chimerism data on one of them). On day +100, 46 patients (47.9%) had full chimerism (FC) and 50 (52.1%) had MC, whereas at last follow-up 50 (51.5%) exhibited FC and the remaining 47 (48.5%) had MC. Cumulative incidence of all grades acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was 13.4% and that of grade III to IV GVHD was 4.1%. Chronic GVHD was seen in eight (8.0%) patients. Incidence of severe acute GVHD (grade >= III) and that of chronic GVHD were not significantly associated with FC or MC measured at day +100 (P values = .347 and .254, respectively), nor at the last follow-up. Graft failure occurred in 2 patients; both from the MC at day +100 group. No graft failures occurred in the FC at day +100 group (P value = 1.00). At a median follow-up of 83.8 months (95% confidence interval, 51.0-116.6; range, 19.3-181.1 months) the cumulative probability of overall survival (OS) at 5 years was 95.7% +- 2.1%. Mean follow-up time in our cohort was 90.7 months. Five-year overall survival was not significantly associated with FC or MC evaluated at day +100 (95.7% +- 3.0% versus 95.6% +- 3.1%, P value = .908) nor at the last follow-up (96.0% +- 2.8% versus 95.4% +- 3.2%, P value = .925). No patient in either group developed MDS/leukemia during the follow-up period. We conclude that mixed chimerism in patients with FA appears to have no adverse effect on outcome in our follow-up period. A longer follow-up period is needed, however, to confirm the validity of this statement.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The aim of this retrospective study was to determine the incidence and the clinical outcome of tongue cancer (TC) in patients affected by Fanconi anemia (FA) who received an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The patient database from the Bone Marrow Transplant Center of Pescara was reviewed to enroll FA patients. Patients', donors', HCT's, and screening's data were collected as well to look for the incidence and the treatment of TC. RESULTS: Twelve patients affected by FA were identified. Three patients died for transplant-related causes. Five of nine surviving patients were diagnosed with TC at a median of 21.7 years since transplantation and at a median age of 32.10 years. Interestingly, no patient manifested graft-versus-host-disease (GvHD). The 28-year cumulative incidence function of TC was 46.9% (95% CI, 36.9-56.9%). Two patients were treated with chemotherapy alone, two patients were treated with surgery alone, and one with surgery followed by chemotherapy. Overall, 4 patients with TC showed a clinical course characterized by a marked aggressiveness of the tumor disease which led to death due to cancer progression between 2 and 13 months. One patient is surviving 8 months after diagnosis of TC. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms the high incidence of tumors and in particular tongue tumors in allotransplanted FA patients. A careful screening has to be life-long maintained. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Considering the rarity of FA and the frailty of FA patients, this study may add important information for the cancer management of these patients.",

We retrospectively evaluated outcomes of thirty patients with FA and MDS/AML who underwent first allogeneic HCT with a T-cell depleted (TCD) graft at our institution. Patients were transplanted on successive protocols with stepwise changes in cytoreduction and GVHD prophylaxis. All but two patients (93%) experienced durable hematopoietic engraftment. With median follow-up of 8.7 years, 5-year OS was 66.8% and DFS 53.8%. No significant differences in survival were found in patients with high-risk prognostic features (age >=20 years, AML diagnosis, alternative donor graft) or when stratified by conditioning regimen. The 5-year cumulative incidences of relapse and NRM were 24.3% and 21.9%, respectively. NRM was higher in patients >=20 years at HCT but did not otherwise differ. We herein demonstrate promising outcomes following allogeneic HCT for patients with FA and MDS/AML using TCD grafts, particularly in a cohort of high-risk patients with 50% >=20 years and a majority receiving mismatched grafts. Future prospective studies are needed to compare this approach with other HCT platforms.",

Corroborative human and murine studies point to a fetal origin of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) attrition under replicative stress. Along with intriguing recent insights into non-canonical roles and domain-specific functions of FA proteins, these studies have raised the possibility of a DNA repair-independent BMF etiology. However, deeper mechanistic insight is critical as current curative options of allogeneic stem cell transplantation and emerging gene therapy have limited eligibility, carry significant side effects, and involve complex procedures restricted to resource-rich environments. To develop rational and broadly accessible therapies for FA patients, the field will need more faithful disease models that overcome the scarcity of patient samples, leverage technological advances, and adopt investigational clinical trial designs tailored for rare diseases.",

Zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator- like effector nucleases (TALENs) and CRISPR-Cas9 have been already applied by ex vivo hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene therapy in genetic diseases (i.e., Hemoglobinopathies, Fanconi anemia and hereditary Immunodeficiencies) as well as infectious diseases (i.e., HIV), and the recent development of CRISPR-Cas9-based systems using base and prime editors as well as epigenome editors has provided safer tools for gene therapy. The ex vivo approach for gene addition or editing of HSCs, however, is complex, invasive, technically challenging, costly and not free of toxicity. In vivo gene addition or editing promise to transform gene therapy from a highly sophisticated strategy to a \"user-friendly' approach to eventually become a broadly available, highly accessible and potentially affordable treatment modality. In the present review article, based on the lessons gained by more than 3 decades of ex vivo HSC gene therapy, we discuss the concept, the tools, the progress made and the challenges to clinical translation of in vivo HSC gene editing.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: The DNA damage immune response (DDIR) assay was developed in breast cancer based on biology associated with deficiencies in homologous recombination and Fanconi anemia pathways. A positive DDIR call identifies patients likely to respond to platinum-based chemotherapies in breast and esophageal cancers. In colorectal cancer, there is currently no biomarker to predict response to oxaliplatin. We tested the ability of the DDIR assay to predict response to oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in colorectal cancer and characterized the biology in DDIR-positive colorectal cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Samples and clinical data were assessed according to DDIR status from patients who received either 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or 5FUFA (bolus and infusion 5-FU with folinic acid) plus oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) within the FOCUS trial (n = 361, stage IV), or neoadjuvant FOLFOX in the FOxTROT trial (n = 97, stage II/III). Whole transcriptome, mutation, and IHC data of these samples were used to interrogate the biology of DDIR in colorectal cancer. RESULTS: Contrary to our hypothesis, DDIR-negative patients displayed a trend toward improved outcome for oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy compared with DDIR-positive patients. DDIR positivity was associated with microsatellite instability (MSI) and colorectal molecular subtype 1. Refinement of the DDIR signature, based on overlapping IFN-related chemokine signaling associated with DDIR positivity across colorectal cancer and breast cancer cohorts, further confirmed that the DDIR assay did not have predictive value for oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in colorectal cancer. CONCLUSIONS: DDIR positivity does not predict improved response following oxaliplatin treatment in colorectal cancer. However, data presented here suggest the potential of the DDIR assay in identifying immune-rich tumors that may benefit from immune checkpoint blockade, beyond current use of MSI status.",

                    "abstract": "High-dose chemotherapy with melphalan followed by autologous transplantation is a first-line treatment for multiple myeloma. Here, we present preclinical evidence that this treatment may be significantly improved by the addition of exportin 1 inhibitors (XPO1i). The XPO1i selinexor, eltanexor, and KOS-2464 sensitized human multiple myeloma cells to melphalan. Human 8226 and U266 multiple myeloma cell lines and melphalan-resistant cell lines (8226-LR5 and U266-LR6) were highly sensitized to melphalan by XPO1i. Multiple myeloma cells from newly diagnosed and relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients were also sensitized by XPO1i to melphalan. In NOD/SCIDgamma mice challenged with either parental 8226 or U266 multiple myeloma and melphalan-resistant multiple myeloma tumors, XPO1i/melphalan combination treatments demonstrated stronger synergistic antitumor effects than single-agent melphalan with minimal toxicity. Synergistic cell death resulted from increased XPO1i/melphalan-induced DNA damage in a dose-dependent manner and decreased DNA repair. In addition, repair of melphalan-induced DNA damage was inhibited by selinexor, which decreased melphalan-induced monoubiquitination of FANCD2 in multiple myeloma cells. Knockdown of FANCD2 was found to replicate the effect of selinexor when used with melphalan, increasing DNA damage (gammaH2AX) by inhibiting DNA repair. Thus, combination therapies that include selinexor or eltanexor with melphalan may have the potential to improve treatment outcomes of multiple myeloma in melphalan-resistant and newly diagnosed patients. The combination of selinexor and melphalan is currently being investigated in the context of high-dose chemotherapy and autologous transplant (NCT02780609). SIGNIFICANCE: Inhibition of exportin 1 with selinexor synergistically sensitizes human multiple myeloma to melphalan by inhibiting Fanconi anemia pathway-mediated DNA repair.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: A MASCC/ISOO Clinical Practice Statement (CPS) is aimed at generating a concise tool for clinicians that concentrates practical information needed for the management of oral complications of cancer patients. This CPS is focused on the risk of secondary oral cancer following hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). METHODS: This CPS was developed based on critical evaluation of the literature followed by a structured discussion of a group of leading experts, members of the Oral Care Study Group of MASCC/ISOO. The information is presented in the form of succinct bullets to generate a short manual about the best standard of care. RESULTS: Studies described a 7-16-fold higher risk of secondary oral cancer (mainly squamous cell carcinoma) in allogeneic HCT (alloHCT) recipients, particularly in those who developed chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD). Risk increases over time and is influenced by several risk factors. In autologous HCT, oral cancer risk seemed only slightly elevated. CONCLUSION: Clinicians should be aware of the higher oral cancer risk in alloHCT survivors, and emphasize the importance of lifelong oral cancer surveillance (at least every 6-12 months) and avoiding cancer promoting lifestyle factors in an empathic way, particularly of those with (a history of) cGVHD. Post-HCT for Fanconi anemia or dyskeratosis congenita, education and rigorous follow-up is even more crucial. In case of suspected oral lesions in the presence of oral mucosal cGVHD, a GVHD intervention may facilitate diagnosis. Suspected lesions should be biopsied. More research is needed on the role of HPV in oral cancer post-HCT.",

PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors upregulate T-cell killing of cancer cells and is a class of promising treatment for FA-AML. Here, we developed a novel FA-AML murine model that allows the study of human AML with a humanized immune system in order to investigate immunotherapeutic treatments in vivo. FA-AML1 cells and non-FA-mutated Kasumi-1 cells were injected into 8-10 week old NSG mice. Once leukemic engraftment was confirmed by HLA-DR expression in the peripheral blood, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMCs) were injected into the mice. One week post-hPBMCs injection, Nivolumab (PD-1 inhibitor) or PBS vehicle control was administered to the mice bi-weekly. In our Nivolumab treated mice, FA-AML1, but not Kasumi-1-engrafted mice, had significantly prolonged overall survival. Both FA-AML1 and Kasumi-1 engrafted mice had decreased spleen weights. Higher leukemic infiltration into vital organs was observed in FA-AML1 engrafted mice compared to Kasumi-1 engrafted mice. In conclusion, our novel humanized murine model of FA-mutated AML is an attractive tool for supporting further studies and clinical trials using PD-1 inhibitors to treat FA-mutated AML.",

                    "abstract": "Recently, the results of gastric cancer treatment have improved; however, its characteristics in adolescents and young adults are not well known. We report the case of a patient with advanced gastric cancer, Fanconi anemia (FA), and primary biliary cholangitis. A 26-year-old woman visited a local physician complaining of epigastralgia. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed edematous changes with poor distension and circumferential thickened folds with erosions in the gastric body. Biopsy results of the lesion specimens revealed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed gastric wall with irregular thickness, several nodules in the peritoneal cavity, and a mass lesion in the right ovary. We diagnosed the patient with T4N2M1 stage IV gastric cancer accompanied by peritoneal and ovarian metastases and initiated nivolumab with S-1 plus oxaliplatin as the first-line treatment regimen. Because of immune-related adverse events after one course of systemic treatment, the regimen was changed to ramucirumab combined with nab-paclitaxel chemotherapy as the second-line treatment. After three cycles of weekly nab-paclitaxel with ramucirumab, the decreased platelet count did not recover, and her general condition gradually deteriorated. Comprehensive genome profiling using next-generation sequencing was performed to determine the feasibility of genotype-matched therapies. Alterations in FA complementation group A (FANCA) F1263del (49.1%) and E484Q (12.3%), which encode a key component of the multiprotein FA complex, were identified. The patient died 10 months after treatment initiation. In conclusion, when treating malignancies in adolescent and young adult patients, the genomic background should be considered.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: A MASCC/ISOO Clinical Practice Statement (CPS) is aimed at generating a concise tool for clinicians that concentrates practical information needed for the management of oral complications of cancer patients. This CPS is focused on the risk of secondary oral cancer following hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). METHODS: This CPS was developed based on critical evaluation of the literature followed by a structured discussion of a group of leading experts, members of the Oral Care Study Group of MASCC/ISOO. The information is presented in the form of succinct bullets to generate a short manual about the best standard of care. RESULTS: Studies described a 7-16-fold higher risk of secondary oral cancer (mainly squamous cell carcinoma) in allogeneic HCT (alloHCT) recipients, particularly in those who developed chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD). Risk increases over time and is influenced by several risk factors. In autologous HCT, oral cancer risk seemed only slightly elevated. CONCLUSION: Clinicians should be aware of the higher oral cancer risk in alloHCT survivors, and emphasize the importance of lifelong oral cancer surveillance (at least every 6-12 months) and avoiding cancer promoting lifestyle factors in an empathic way, particularly of those with (a history of) cGVHD. Post-HCT for Fanconi anemia or dyskeratosis congenita, education and rigorous follow-up is even more crucial. In case of suspected oral lesions in the presence of oral mucosal cGVHD, a GVHD intervention may facilitate diagnosis. Suspected lesions should be biopsied. More research is needed on the role of HPV in oral cancer post-HCT.",

                    "abstract": "Fanconi anemia (FA) cells are characterized by genomic instability, which places FA patients at risk for malignancies such as leukemia and oropharyngeal/urogenital cancers. The risk of development of leukemia is theoretically eliminated after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Mixed chimerism (MC) in FA patients might have a unique implication because the persistent existence of FA cells might give rise to a malignant clone. We have studied a large population of FA patients who underwent allogeneic HCT at our institution and report here the outcome according to chimerism status. Patients with FA who had evidence of progressive bone marrow failure and were blood products-transfusion dependent (packed red blood cells, platelets, or both) were included in the study. Those who had myelodysplasia (MDS) or an abnormal clone or evidence of leukemia were excluded. All but 3 patients had normal renal and cardiac function at the time of transplantation. In total, 160 patients with FA underwent allogeneic HCT at our center from January 1995 to December 2017; mean age at HCT was 8.4. Chimerism data at last follow-up visit were available on 97 patients who are the subjects of this analysis (no day +100 chimerism data on one of them). On day +100, 46 patients (47.9%) had full chimerism (FC) and 50 (52.1%) had MC, whereas at last follow-up 50 (51.5%) exhibited FC and the remaining 47 (48.5%) had MC. Cumulative incidence of all grades acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was 13.4% and that of grade III to IV GVHD was 4.1%. Chronic GVHD was seen in eight (8.0%) patients. Incidence of severe acute GVHD (grade >= III) and that of chronic GVHD were not significantly associated with FC or MC measured at day +100 (P values = .347 and .254, respectively), nor at the last follow-up. Graft failure occurred in 2 patients; both from the MC at day +100 group. No graft failures occurred in the FC at day +100 group (P value = 1.00). At a median follow-up of 83.8 months (95% confidence interval, 51.0-116.6; range, 19.3-181.1 months) the cumulative probability of overall survival (OS) at 5 years was 95.7% +- 2.1%. Mean follow-up time in our cohort was 90.7 months. Five-year overall survival was not significantly associated with FC or MC evaluated at day +100 (95.7% +- 3.0% versus 95.6% +- 3.1%, P value = .908) nor at the last follow-up (96.0% +- 2.8% versus 95.4% +- 3.2%, P value = .925). No patient in either group developed MDS/leukemia during the follow-up period. We conclude that mixed chimerism in patients with FA appears to have no adverse effect on outcome in our follow-up period. A longer follow-up period is needed, however, to confirm the validity of this statement.",

The FANCA gene is the most commonly pathogenic gene, accounting for more than 60% of all causative genes. PATIENT CONCERNS: The clinical case is a 3-year-old boy showed mild anemia and scattered bleeding spots the size of a needle tip all over his body. DIAGNOSES: Compound heterozygous mutation was identified in the FANCA gene in the FA case: c.1A > T from the father in exon 1; the deletion of chr16: 89857810-89858476 (exon13-14 del) from the mother; finally, the patient was diagnosed as Fanconi anemia. INTERVENTION: After diagnosis, the child received chemotherapy (Ara-C + Flu + Cy + ATG). Then, the hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and unrelated umbilical cord blood transfusion were performed. OUTCOMES: The child is recovering well and is in regular follow-up. CONCLUSION AND LESSONS: The discovery of new mutations in the FANCA gene enriches the genetic profile of FA and helps clinicians to further understand this disease and guide genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis. Whole-exome sequencing is a powerful tool for diagnosing FA.",

Due to DNA instability in FA, RIC has been used to decrease immediate and late complications of HSCT. Most FA conditioning regimens in mismatched and unrelated donor transplants rely on TBI, which increases the risk of secondary malignancies. Most of the non-TBI conditioning regimens use an ex vivo T-cell depletion approach, but this is not feasible at all pediatric stem cell transplant programs. To evaluate the success of HSCT in patients with FA using non-TBI conditioning regimens with in vivo T-cell depletion approach. HSCT using non-TBI based conditioning was performed on two siblings with FA. The first sibling underwent matched unrelated donor transplant with a BM graft using fludarabine, alemtuzumab, busulfan, and cyclophosphamide conditioning and cyclosporine and mycophenolate as GVHD prophylaxis. The second sibling underwent MSD transplant with UCB and BM grafts using similar approach, but without busulfan and mycophenolate. Both siblings had engraftment without signs of acute or chronic GVHD. Acute post-transplant complications included brief viral reactivations. At last follow-up, both siblings continued to have full immune reconstitution with stable chimerism. Conditioning regimens without radiation and inclusion of alemtuzumab can lead to successful engraftment without development of GVHD and reduce risk of developing secondary neoplasms, even with unrelated donor transplants.",

                    "abstract": "Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is one of the most common neurologic complications following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). We aimed to evaluate the incidence, clinical, and imaging features of PRES in pediatric patients with Fanconi anemia (FA) following HSCT. This prospective study included all post-HSCT patients with underlying FA disease between 2014 and 2017. Brain computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed in all individuals who developed neurologic symptoms. PRES was diagnosed based on clinic-radiological evidence. Follow-up MRI was performed in all patients with PRES within two months. Forty-one patients with FA (28 males; mean age, 8.19 +- 3.25 years) were enrolled. Out of 15 patients with acute neurologic symptoms, PRES was diagnosed in 9 individuals (21.95% of the total cohort). The occurrence of PRES was significantly higher in patients who had a donor with a 1-locus mismatch (P= .02). Donor relation, stem cell source, and graft-versus-host disease grade did not have any significant association with the development of PRES. MRI showed asymmetric vasogenic edema in 5 patients, an overt infarct in 1 patient, and foci of microhemorrhages in 3 patients, 1 of whom developed a hemorrhagic infarct. This patient died shortly, and persistent microhemorrhages were noted in the other 2 patients. Our findings demonstrate a greater risk of developing PRES after HSCT in patients with FA compared with those with other diseases (21.95% versus 1% to 10%), and in contrast to its term, it might be irreversible and has adverse effects on HSCT outcomes. The increased vascular and endothelial fragility in FA may contribute to the higher frequency of PRES in these individuals.",

METHODS: Retrospective study in 22 FA patients who had received HSCT and had been followed up beyond 2 years after HSCT. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 15 years. Six patients developed head-and-neck SCC after transplantation. The cumulative incidence of SCC at 15 and 30 years from the HSCT was 14.2% and 71.2%, respectively. One patient was diagnosed in stage IV and the rest, who were being followed up in cancer screening programs, in stage I. Treatment of SCC consisted of surgery in all patients; radiotherapy and chemotherapy were used in two patients and were poorly tolerated. CONCLUSION: FA patients have high risk of head-and-neck SCC. Multi-disciplinary programs for early cancer detection are of special relevance in these patients.",

The diseases are heterogeneous and characterized by developmental abnormalities, progressive marrow failure, and predisposition to cancer. A correct diagnosis allows for appropriate treatment, genetic counseling, and cancer surveillance. The common IBMFSs are Fanconi anemia, dyskeratosis congenita, and Diamond-Blackfan anemia. Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) offers curative treatment of the hematologic complications of IBMFS. Because of the systemic nature of these diseases, transplant strategies are modified to decrease immediate and late toxicities. HCT from HLA-matched related or unrelated donors offers excellent survival for young patients in aplasia. Challenges include the treatment of adults with marrow aplasia, presentation with myeloid malignancy regardless of age, and early detection or treatment of cancer. In this article, I will describe our approach and evaluation of patients transplanted with IBMFS and review most frequent complications before and after transplant.",

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of patients with Fanconi Anemia from a quaternary referral center between 2007-2021 was completed for head and neck cancer risk. RESULTS: One hundred and five FA patients were reviewed. Average age at presentation was 11.3 years old and 90.5% of patients underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). A total of 8.6% of patients had leukoplakia or erythroplakia and 3.8% developed malignancy. The standardized incidence ratio of head and neck malignancy was 483.8. Patients presented with leukoplakia and malignancy at an average age of 14.6 and 25.1 years old, respectively. Malignancies were aggressive and marked by recurrence. There were no premalignant or malignant lesions found on flexible laryngoscopy. This series represents the largest longitudinal series of pediatric FA head and neck lesions. CONCLUSIONS: Fanconi Anemia patients should begin screening for head and neck cancer at age 10 or after HSCT. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 4 Laryngoscope, 2022.",

This retrospective study, conducted on behalf of the EBMT SAAWP and PDWP, aims to report the current outcomes of haplo-SCT in I-BMFs, comparing the different in vivo and ex vivo T-cell depletion approaches. One hundred and sixty-two I-BMF patients who underwent haplo-SCT (median age 7.4 years) have been registered. Fanconi Anemia was the most represented diagnosis (70.1%). Based on different T-cell depletion (TCD) approaches, four categories were identified: (1) TCRalphabeta+ /CD19+ -depletion (43.8%); (2) T-repleted with post-transplant Cyclophosphamide (PTCy, 34.0%); (3) In-vivo T-depletion with ATG/alemtuzumab (14.8%); (4) CD34+ positive selection (7.4%). The cumulative incidences (CI) of neutrophil and platelet engraftment were 84% and 76% respectively, while that of primary and secondary graft failure was 10% and 8% respectively. The 100-day CI of acute GvHD grade III-IV(95% CI) was 13%, while the 24-month CI of extensive chronic GvHD was 4%. After a median follow-up of 43.4 months, the 2-year overall survival(OS) and GvHD/Rejection-free Survival (GRFS) probabilities are 67% and 53%, respectively. The TCR CD3+ alphabeta+ /CD19+ depletion group showed a significantly lower incidence of both acute and chronic GvHD and higher OS (79%; p0.013) and GRFS (71%; p < .001), while no significant differences in outcomes have been observed by different diagnosis and conditioning regimens. This large retrospective study supports the safety and feasibility of haplo-SCT in I-BMF patients. TCRalphabeta+ /CD19+ depletion offers higher chances of patients' survival, with a significantly lower risk of severe a- and c-GvHD in I-BMFs compared to other platforms.",

Calcineurin inhibitors are medications commonly used for long periods in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) and solid organ transplantation. Medication-related fibrovascular hyperplasia (MRFH) is an extra gingival hyperplastic nodular growth associated with medications use. This study reports five cases of pediatric patients (6 to 12-years-old) diagnosed with Fanconi anemia (FA) after HSCT who presented similar oral mucosal lesions associated with the use of cyclosporine, phenobarbital and amlodipine. After excision of the lesions, histopathological analysis described them as pyogenic granuloma (PG). As the aetiology of the lesions manifested by the patients was associated with the use of medications, the final diagnosis was MRFH. Despite the clinical and histopathological similarity between PG and MRFH, it is fundamental to know the aetiological agent for achieving definitive diagnosis and correct management. Considering the etiologic agent (medication) and histopathological findings, it is suggested that the most appropriate term for this manifestation should be \"medication-related fibrovascular hyperplasia\". The correct nomenclature related to extra gingival hyperplastic lesions identified in patients on medications with potential to induce hyperplastic reactions should be adopted to facilitate scientific communication and improve the treatment.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Outcome of children with medulloblastoma (MB) and Fanconi Anemia (FA), an inherited DNA repair deficiency, has not been described systematically. Treatment is complicated by high vulnerability to treatment-associated side effects, yet structured data are lacking. This study aims at giving a comprehensive overview about clinical and molecular characteristics of pediatric FA MB patients. METHODS: Clinical data including detailed information on treatment and toxicities of six previously unreported FA MB patients were supplemented with data of 16 published cases. RESULTS: We identified 22 cases of children with FA and MB with clinical data available. All MBs with subgroup reporting were SHH-activated (n=9), confirmed by methylation profiling in five patients. FA MB patients exclusively belonged to complementation groups FA-D1 (n=16) or FA-N (n=3). Patients were treated with postoperative chemotherapy only (50%) or radiotherapy (RT)+-chemotherapy (27%). 23% did not receive adjuvant therapy. Excessive treatment-related toxicities were frequent. Severe hematological toxicity occurred in 91% of patients treated with alkylating chemotherapy, while non-alkylating agents and RT were less toxic. Median overall survival (OS) was 1 year (95%CI 0.3-1.8). 1-year-progression-free-survival (PFS) was 26.3+-10.1% and 1-year-OS was 42.1+-11.3%. Adjuvant therapy prolonged survival (1y-OS/1y-PFS 0%/0% without adjuvant therapy vs. 53.3+-12.9%/33.3+-12.2% with adjuvant therapy, p=0.006/p=0.086). CONCLUSIONS: MB in FA patients is strongly associated with SHH activation and FA-D1/FA-N. Despite the dismal prognosis, adjuvant therapy may prolong survival. Non-alkylating chemotherapy and RT are feasible in selected patients with careful monitoring of toxicities and dose adjustments. Curative therapy for FA MB-SHH remains an unmet medical need.",

The condition is caused by mutations in genes responsible for DNA repair. People with FA have an increased risk of developing tumors due to DNA damage. Flat-cell carcinomas of the head, neck, esophagus, and genital organs are often observed in individuals with FA. CASE REPORT A 31-year-old man with Fanconi anemia and a history of bone marrow transplantation was admitted to the General Surgery Department due to elevated levels of the CEA marker. Before the transplantation, chromosomal anomalies, bone marrow hypoplasia, kidney agenesis, and bone defects were noted. After the transplantation, he developed a skin rash. He was also diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the lip and chronic conditions, including cholestatic liver damage, hypertension, and hypothyroidism. During the diagnostic process, computed tomography showed signs of Barrett's esophagus, numerous polyps in the stomach and intestines, and a nodular formation measuring 4.5x5x5.5 cm in the right iliac region. Laparoscopy revealed a neoplasm of the appendix with numerous metastases on the inner abdominal wall and omentum. Histological analysis confirmed mucinous appendiceal cancer. The patient was discharged for palliative treatment at the Oncology Center with a final diagnosis of appendiceal cancer, mucinous type, grade G3. This case underscores the importance of early and comprehensive cancer screening in individuals with FA, particularly those with a history of bone marrow transplantation. CONCLUSIONS This clinical case underscores the critical importance of thorough and timely cancer diagnosis in individuals with this genetic pathology.",

Translesion synthesis is regulated via ubiquitination of PCNA, and independently via translesion synthesis polymerase REV1. The division of labor between PCNA-ubiquitination and REV1 in interstrand crosslink repair is unclear. Inhibition of either of these pathways has been proposed as a strategy to increase cytotoxicity of platinating agents in cancer treatment. Here, we defined the importance of PCNA-ubiquitination and REV1 for DNA in mammalian ICL repair. In mice, loss of PCNA-ubiquitination, but not REV1, resulted in germ cell defects and hypersensitivity to cisplatin. Loss of PCNA-ubiquitination, but not REV1 sensitized mammalian cancer cell lines to cisplatin. We identify polymerase Kappa as essential in tolerating DNA damage-induced lesions, in particular cisplatin lesions. Polk-deficient tumors were controlled by cisplatin treatment and it significantly delayed tumor outgrowth and increased overall survival of tumor bearing mice. Our results indicate that PCNA-ubiquitination and REV1 play distinct roles in DNA damage tolerance. Moreover, our results highlight POLK as a critical TLS polymerase in tolerating multiple genotoxic lesions, including cisplatin lesions. The relative frequent loss of Polk in cancers indicates an exploitable vulnerability for precision cancer medicine.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Fanconi anemia (FA) is an inherited disorder characterized clinically by congenital abnormalities, progressive bone marrow failure (BMF), and a predisposition to malignancy. Gene therapy (GT) of FA, via the infusion of gene-corrected peripheral blood (PB) autologous hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), may constitute a cure for BMF. GT bypasses the donor restrictions and adverse events associated with allogenic HSC transplantation. However, adequate harvesting of PB-HSCs is a crucial determinant of successful engraftment in gene therapy. Harvesting the low numbers of HSCs in patients with FA is particularly challenging. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This open-label phase I/II trial evaluates the feasibility and safety of co-administration of G-CSF and plerixafor in patients with FA for the mobilization and harvesting of peripheral HSCs, intending to use them in a gene therapy trial. Patients with mutations in the FANCA gene received two subcutaneous injections of G-CSF (6 mug/kg x 2/d from D1 to D8. Plerixafor (0.24 mg/kg/d) was administered 2 h before apheresis (from D5 onward). RESULTS: CD34+ cells were mobilized for four patients quickly but transiently after the plerixafor injection. One patient had a CD34+ cell count of over 100/mul; the mobilization peaked 2 h after the injection and lasted for more than 9 h. There were no short-term adverse events associated with the mobilization or harvesting procedures. CONCLUSION: Our data in patients with FA show that the mobilization of HSCs with G-CSF and plerixafor is safe and more efficient in younger individuals without BMF.",

The data show that, unlike patients with Fanconi anemia (FA), the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) reservoir of patients with DBA was not significantly reduced, suggesting that collection of these cells should not constitute a remarkable restriction for DBA gene therapy. Subsequently, 2 clinically applicable lentiviral vectors were developed. In the former lentiviral vector, PGK.CoRPS19 LV, a codon-optimized version of RPS19 was driven by the phosphoglycerate kinase promoter (PGK) already used in different gene therapy trials, including FA gene therapy. In the latter one, EF1alpha.CoRPS19 LV, RPS19 expression was driven by the elongation factor alpha short promoter, EF1alpha(s). Preclinical experiments showed that transduction of DBA patient CD34+ cells with the PGK.CoRPS19 LV restored erythroid differentiation, and demonstrated the long-term repopulating properties of corrected DBA CD34+ cells, providing evidence of improved erythroid maturation. Concomitantly, long-term restoration of ribosomal biogenesis was verified using a potentially novel method applicable to patients' blood cells, based on ribosomal RNA methylation analyses. Finally, in vivo safety studies and proviral insertion site analyses showed that lentivirus-mediated gene therapy was nontoxic.",

                    "abstract": "Fanconi anemia (FA) is a disease caused by defective deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair that manifests as bone marrow failure, cancer predisposition, and developmental defects. We previously reported that monotherapy with either metformin (MET) or oxymetholone (OXM) improved peripheral blood (PB) counts and the number and functionality of bone marrow hematopoietic stem progenitor cells (HSPCs) number in Fancd2-/- mice. To evaluate whether the combination treatment of these drugs has a synergistic effect to prevent bone marrow failure in FA, we treated cohorts of Fancd2-/- mice and wildtype controls with either MET alone, OXM alone, MET+OXM, or placebo diet from age 3 weeks to 18 months. The OXM treated animals showed modest improvements in blood parameters including platelet count (p = .01) and hemoglobin levels (p < .05). In addition, the percentage of quiescent hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) (LSK [Lin-Sca+c-Kit+]) was significantly increased (p = .001) by long-term treatment with MET alone. The combination of metformin and oxymetholone did not result in a significant synergistic effect in any hematopoietic parameter. Gene expression analysis of liver tissue from these animals showed that some of the expression changes caused by Fancd2 deletion were partially normalized by metformin treatment. Importantly, no adverse effects of the individual or combination therapies were observed, despite the long-term administration. We conclude that androgen therapy is not a contraindication to concurrent metformin administration in clinical trials. HIGHLIGHTS: Long-term coadministration of metformin in combination with oxymetholone is well tolerated by Fancd2-/- mice. Hematopoietic stem cell quiescence in mutant mice was enhanced by treatment with metformin alone. Metformin treatment caused a partial normalization of gene expression in the livers of mutant mice.",

                    "abstract": "High-dose chemotherapy with melphalan followed by autologous transplantation is a first-line treatment for multiple myeloma. Here, we present preclinical evidence that this treatment may be significantly improved by the addition of exportin 1 inhibitors (XPO1i). The XPO1i selinexor, eltanexor, and KOS-2464 sensitized human multiple myeloma cells to melphalan. Human 8226 and U266 multiple myeloma cell lines and melphalan-resistant cell lines (8226-LR5 and U266-LR6) were highly sensitized to melphalan by XPO1i. Multiple myeloma cells from newly diagnosed and relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients were also sensitized by XPO1i to melphalan. In NOD/SCIDgamma mice challenged with either parental 8226 or U266 multiple myeloma and melphalan-resistant multiple myeloma tumors, XPO1i/melphalan combination treatments demonstrated stronger synergistic antitumor effects than single-agent melphalan with minimal toxicity. Synergistic cell death resulted from increased XPO1i/melphalan-induced DNA damage in a dose-dependent manner and decreased DNA repair. In addition, repair of melphalan-induced DNA damage was inhibited by selinexor, which decreased melphalan-induced monoubiquitination of FANCD2 in multiple myeloma cells. Knockdown of FANCD2 was found to replicate the effect of selinexor when used with melphalan, increasing DNA damage (gammaH2AX) by inhibiting DNA repair. Thus, combination therapies that include selinexor or eltanexor with melphalan may have the potential to improve treatment outcomes of multiple myeloma in melphalan-resistant and newly diagnosed patients. The combination of selinexor and melphalan is currently being investigated in the context of high-dose chemotherapy and autologous transplant (NCT02780609). SIGNIFICANCE: Inhibition of exportin 1 with selinexor synergistically sensitizes human multiple myeloma to melphalan by inhibiting Fanconi anemia pathway-mediated DNA repair.",

Nonetheless, approximately one-third of the CP-CML patient's progress to advanced phases of CML (accelerated and blast phase). Impaired DNA repair including mutations in Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway genes are responsible for progression of many cancers. Nevertheless, FA-pathways genes have never been reported in myeloid cancers. Hence, this study was aimed to discover DNA repair genes associated with CML progression. AP-CML patients were subjected to whole exome sequencing along with appropriate controls. A novel splice site FANCD2 mutation was detected. FANCD2 is a well-known FA-pathway gene with established role in DNA repair. This is first report of FA-pathway DNA repair genes in myeloid cancers that can serve as a novel marker of CML progression to clinically intervene CML progression. Further studies are needed to establish the functional role of FANCD2 in CML progression that can provide novel insights into CML pathogenesis. This study also indicates that a combination TKIs and Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors like Olaparib (FDA approved anti-cancer drug for FA-pathway gene mutations) could improve the clinical outcome CML patients in accelerated and blast-crisis phases of the disease.",

The aim of our study is to evaluate the impact and benefits of allogenic matched donor HSCT in a case of a 12 year-old girl with FA, who displayed good clinical evolution following 2 months post-transplantation. METHODS: In the pre-transplant phase, reference blood samples from the donor and recipient were collected on EDTA. The DNA from blood samples was extracted using an automated Maxwell  48 RSC instrument (Promega, USA) with the Maxwell  RSC Whole blood DNA kit (Promega, USA). For DNA quantification, the PowerQuant System kit (Promega, USA) was used with the ABI 7500 Real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, USA). The amplification of the short tandem repeat markers was performed using the 24plex Investigator QS kit (Qiagen, Germany) on a ProFlex PCR System. Furthermore, the PCR products were separated and detected on an ABI 3500 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosytems, USA). RESULTS: Thirty days post transplantation, a complete chimerism (CC) was achieved with a full replacement by do-nor derived hematopoietic cells. Sixty days post transplantation, the CC status was maintained with improvement of hematological findings. CONCLUSIONS: In FA, chimerism monitoring after HSCT provides useful information regarding engraftment or possibility of post-transplantation complications such as graft versus host disease.",

Classical IBMFSs primarily include Fanconi anemia with impaired DNA damage repair, dyskeratosis congenita with telomere maintenance dysfunction, and Diamond-Blackfan anemia with aberrant ribosomal protein biosynthesis. Recently, comprehensive genetic analyses have been implemented for the definitive diagnosis of classic IBMFSs, and advances in molecular genetics have led to the identification of novel disorders such as AMeD and MIRAGE syndromes. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), a promising option to overcome impaired hematopoiesis in patients with IBMFSs, does not correct nonhematological defects and may enhance the risk of secondary malignancies. Disease-specific management is necessary because IBMFSs differ in underlying defects and are associated with varying degrees of risk for clonal evolution and early or late complications after HCT. In addition, long-term follow-up is essential to detect complications related to the IBMFS or HCT. This review provides a summary of current clinical practices along with the latest data on HCT in IBMFSs.",

We report the case of a patient with advanced gastric cancer, Fanconi anemia (FA), and primary biliary cholangitis. A 26-year-old woman visited a local physician complaining of epigastralgia. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed edematous changes with poor distension and circumferential thickened folds with erosions in the gastric body. Biopsy results of the lesion specimens revealed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed gastric wall with irregular thickness, several nodules in the peritoneal cavity, and a mass lesion in the right ovary. We diagnosed the patient with T4N2M1 stage IV gastric cancer accompanied by peritoneal and ovarian metastases and initiated nivolumab with S-1 plus oxaliplatin as the first-line treatment regimen. Because of immune-related adverse events after one course of systemic treatment, the regimen was changed to ramucirumab combined with nab-paclitaxel chemotherapy as the second-line treatment. After three cycles of weekly nab-paclitaxel with ramucirumab, the decreased platelet count did not recover, and her general condition gradually deteriorated. Comprehensive genome profiling using next-generation sequencing was performed to determine the feasibility of genotype-matched therapies. Alterations in FA complementation group A (FANCA) F1263del (49.1%) and E484Q (12.3%), which encode a key component of the multiprotein FA complex, were identified. The patient died 10 months after treatment initiation. In conclusion, when treating malignancies in adolescent and young adult patients, the genomic background should be considered.",

While several nontransplant treatments are currently under evaluation, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains the only therapeutic option for bone marrow failure (BMF). Although HSCT outcomes in patients with FA have remarkably improved over the past 20 years, in addition to the mortality intrinsic to the procedure, HSCT increases the risk and accelerates the appearance of late malignancies. HSCT offers the best outcome when performed in optimal conditions (moderate cytopenia shifting to severe, prior to transfusion dependence and before clonal evolution or myelodysplasia/acute myeloid leukemia); hence, an accurate surveillance program is vital. Haploidentical HSCT offers very good outcomes, although long-term effects on malignancies have not been fully explored. A monitoring plan is also important to identify cancers, particularly head and neck carcinomas, in very early phases. Gene therapy is still experimental and offers the most encouraging results when performed in early phases of BMF by infusing high numbers of corrected cells without genotoxic effects. Patients with FA need comprehensive monitoring and care plans, coordinated by centers with expertise in FA management, that start at diagnosis and continue throughout life. Such long-term follow-up is essential to detect complications related to the disease or treatment in this setting.",

                    "abstract": "Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a curative treatment for patients with many different blood and immune diseases; however, current treatment regimens contain non-specific chemotherapy and/or irradiation conditioning, which carry both short-term and long-term toxicities. The use of such agents may be particularly harmful for patients with Fanconi anemia (FA), who have genetic mutations resulting in deficiencies in DNA repair, leading to increased sensitivity to genotoxic agents. mAb-based conditioning has been proposed as an alternative conditioning strategy for HSCT that minimizes these toxicities by eliminating collateral tissue damage. Given the high need for improved treatments for FA patients, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of different alphaCD117 mAb agents and immunosuppression on hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) depletion and explored their ability to safely establish therapeutic donor hematopoiesis post-HSCT in FA disease models. We evaluated the effects of different concentrations of alphaCD117 mAbs in vitro and in vivo on HSC growth and depletion. To further assess the efficacy of mAb-based conditioning, Fancd2-/- animals were treated with alphaCD117 mAb and combination agents with alphaCD47 mAb and antibody-drug-conjugates (ADCs) for syngeneic HSCT. Immunosuppression alphaCD4 mAb was added to all in vivo experiments due to a slightly mismatched background between the donor grafts and recipients. Immunosuppressant cocktails were also given to Fancd2-/- animals to evaluate the efficacy of mAb-based conditioning in the haploidentical setting. Statistical analyses were done using the unpaired t-test. We found that antagonistic alphaCD117 mAbs alone do not deplete host HSCs or enhance HSCT effectively in FA mouse models; however, the potency of alphaCD117 mAbs can be safely augmented through combination with alphaCD47 mAbs and with ADCs, both of which lead to profound HSC depletion and establishment of long-term donor engraftment post-syngeneic HSCT. This is the first time these approaches have been tested in parallel in any disease setting, with the greatest donor engraftment observed after CD117-ADC conditioning. Interestingly, our data also suggest that HSC-targeted conditioning is not necessary in HSCT for FA, as high donor HSC engraftment was observed with mAb-based immune suppression alone with immunologically matched and mismatched haploidentical grafts. These results demonstrate the safety and efficacy of several different non-genotoxic mAb-based conditioning strategies in the FA setting. In addition, they show that if sufficient immunosuppression is given to obtain initial donor HSC engraftment, turnover of a majority of the hematolymphoid system can result, likely owing to the survival advantage of wild-type HSCs over FA HSCs. Such non-toxic all-mAb-based conditioning strategies could be transformative for FA patients and those with other hematolymphoid diseases.",

For FA, we prefer haplo-SCT by T-cell receptor alphabetaT-cell and B-cell depletion (alphabetaT/B-depleted haplo-SCT), which can reduce the risks of PT-CY-related complications and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). An 11-year-old boy with diagnosed FA (FANCG mutation) and bone marrow failure was to receive alphabetaT/B-depleted haplo-SCT from his father (HLA 4/8 allele matched) due to absence of an HLA-matched donors. alphabetaT/B-depleted peripheral blood stem cells (CD34 + cell count, 1.17 x 107/kg; alphabeta + T-cell count, 1.3 x 105/kg) were infused following conditioning consisting of fludarabine (150 mg/m2), cyclophosphamide (40 mg/kg), anti-thymocyte globulin (5 mg/kg), rituximab (375 mg/m2), and thoraco-abdominal irradiation (3 Gy). Tacrolimus was used for GVHD prophylaxis until day + 30. Neutrophil engraftment was achieved on day + 9, and complete chimerism was confirmed on days + 28 and + 96. At 12-month post-SCT, the patient was well without GVHD or any other complications. alphabetaT/B-depleted haplo-SCT is a good choice not only for patients unsuitable for PT-CY, but also for all pediatric recipients to reduce SCT-related complications.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a critical condition characterized by a dysregulated immune response to infection, often resulting in organ dysfunction. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a key proinflammatory cytokine associated with sepsis and its complications. This case study explored the use of Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT) combined with Cytosorb in managing pediatric patients with leukemia, severe thrombocytopenia, and elevated IL-6 levels. CASE PRESENTATION: A 10-year-old boy with Fanconi anemia presented with pancytopenia, fever, and necrotic lesions, indicative of mucormycosis. Following the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the patient experienced severe complications, including septic shock. Despite appropriate treatment, inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), and IL-6, were significantly elevated. CRRT with Cytosorb was initiated to manage hypercytokinemia and improve the patient's clinical status. INTERVENTION: The CRRT procedure utilizes citrate as an anticoagulant because of severe thrombocytopenia. The treatment lasted for 20 h, during which the inflammatory biomarkers were monitored. The post-treatment results indicated a significant reduction in IL-6 levels within 24 h and a decrease in PCT levels at 8 h. CRP levels gradually declined over 40 h. OUTCOME: The patient exhibited marked clinical improvement, with significant healing of cutaneous lesions and stabilization of inflammatory markers, allowing transfer to the ward for continued chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: This case suggests that CRRT combined with cytosorb may be a valuable adjunctive therapy for managing complex cases of septic shock. The observed reduction in inflammatory markers, particularly IL-6, warrants further investigation. Concurrent antimicrobial, antifungal, and dexamethasone treatments for IRIS may have influenced the observed outcomes in this single case. Controlled studies are needed to evaluate the specific contribution of Cytosorb-CRRT and assess its long-term efficacy and safety in similar patient populations, particularly in resource-limited settings.

In 1988, Gluckman et al. reported the first successful matched sibling cord blood transplant (CBT) in a child with Fanconi Anemia. In 1991, Rubinstein et al. established an unrelated donor CB bank, and in 1993, the first unrelated CBT used a unit from this bank. Since that time, >40 000 CBTs have been performed worldwide. Early outcomes of CBT were mixed and demonstrated the importance of cell dose from the CB donor. We hypothesized that improvements in CB banking and transplantation favorably impacted outcomes of CBT today and performed a retrospective study combining data from Eurocord and Duke University in 4834 children transplanted with a single unrelated CB unit (CBU) from 1993 to 2019. Changes in standard transplant outcomes (overall survival [OS], disease free survival [DFS], acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease [GvHD], treatment related mortality [TRM], and relapse) over 3 time periods (1: <2005; 2: 2005 to <2010; and 3: >2010 to 2019) were studied. Increased cell dose and degree of HLA matching were observed over time. OS, times to engraftment, and DFS improved over time. The incidence of TRM and GvHD decreased while the incidence of relapse remained unchanged. Relative contributions of cell dose and HLA matching to transplant outcomes were also assessed and showed that HLA matching was more important than cell dose in this pediatric cohort.",

METHODS: According to the inclusion criteria, we selected 395 DNA samples from NSCLC patients for genotyping and combined with clinical data for Cox regression analysis and stratification analyses to assess relationships between overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) with SNPs genotypes. RESULTS: The results revealed that patients with FANCE rs6907678 TT genotype have a longer OS than TC and CC genotype (Additive model: P = 0.004, HR = 1.696, 95% CI = 1.186-2.425).

Its easy design and wide applicability open up a variety of therapeutic alternatives for the treatment of genetic diseases. Indeed, very promising approaches for the correction of hematological disorders have been developed in the recent years, based on the self-renewal and multipotent differentiation properties of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, which make this cell subset the ideal target for gene therapy purposes. This technology has been applied in different congenital blood disorders, such as primary immunodeficiencies, X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency, X-linked chronic granulomatous disease or Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, and inherited bone marrow failure syndromes, such as Fanconi anemia, congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia or severe congenital neutropenia. Furthermore, CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing has been implemented successfully as a novel therapy for cancer immunotherapy, by the development of promising strategies such as the use of oncolytic viruses or adoptive cellular therapy to the chimeric antigen receptor-T-cell therapy. Therefore, considering the variety of genes and mutations affected, we can take advantage of the different DNA repair mechanisms by CRISPR/Cas9 in different manners, from homology-directed repair to non-homologous-end-joining to the latest emerging technologies such as base and prime editing. Although the delivery systems into hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells are still the bottleneck of this technology, some of the advances in genome editing shown in this review have already reached a clinical stage and show very promising preliminary results.",

Among 287 AA patients who excluded Fanconi anemia (FA), Congenital dyskeratosis (DKC), Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), etc.112 underwent matched sibling donor (MSD)-HSCT, 91 matched unrelated donor-HSCT and 84 haploidentical-HSCT. Patients were divided into the following 4 groups: group 1: Donor chimerism (DC); group 2: MC without cytopenia; group 3: MC with cytopenia; group 4: secondary graft failure (SGF). Compared with the other three groups, SGF predicted a poor prognosis of SAA (P< 0.001). In addition, SGF was associated with the early (within 3 months after transplantation) presence of MC and the high levels of MC. Uni- and multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that donor/recipient sex-mismatching and CTX + ATG regimen were high-risk factors for MC. Of note, in MC patients with cytopenia (group 3), the effective response rate reached 55% (6/11) following enhanced immunosuppression combined with cellular therapy, while only one of the four was effective who received enhanced immunosuppression alone. SGF was associated with poor prognosis, early presence of MC and increased levels of recipient chimerism. The donor/recipient sex-mismatching and CTX + ATG regimen based MSD-HSCT were risk factors for MC. Cellular therapy could improve the effective response rate of patients with progressive MC.",

                    "abstract": "Fanconi anemia (FA) is an inherited disorder characterized by congenital malformations, bone marrow failure, and malignancies. Hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) is the only proven cure for the hematological complications. FA patients have increased chromosomal instability and aberrant deoxyribonucleic acid repair and thus can only tolerate low doses of chemotherapy or radiation as part of conditioning prior to HCT. Yet, they are still prone to severe regimen related toxicities including hemorrhagic cystitis (HC) from cyclophosphamide (CY). As CYP2B6 is a primary enzyme responsible for the catalyzation of the prodrug form of CY, understanding the association between CYP2B6 genetic variants and HC in FA patients may predict which patients will be more susceptible to developing HC. A descriptive genetic association study was performed to identify genetic variants associated with HC in patients with FA who underwent HCT between 1999 and 2017. All patients received a CY-based preparative regimen and had pretransplant recipient deoxyribonucleic acid available for genomic analysis. Forty FA pediatric patients were eligible for this analysis. They had received HCT from matched sibling donors (n = 6) or alternative donors (n = 34) for marrow failure (n = 38) or myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 2). The incidence of HC was 32.5% which occurred at a median of 32 days (range 20-180) after HCT. 9 patients had a concomitant viral infection (BK virus, n = 8 both adenovirus and BK virus, n = 1). No genetic variants were significantly associated with HC. The top variants were rs2279343 (g.23060A > G), and rs2279344 (g.23280G > A) in the CYP2B6 gene.

Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), the only potentially curative treatment for the hematological complications of FA, may precipitate acute kidney injury (AKI) and hypertension. We retrospectively investigated 107 FA patients who underwent HCT between 2009 and 2017. We investigated the incidence and risk factors of AKI within 100 days after HCT in a cohort of FA patients, and kidney function and hypertension over 2-year follow-up.The incidence of AKI (mainly stage I) was 18.7%. Patients aged >= 11 years at transplantation showed a higher risk of AKI (OR 3.53). The eGFR was 60-90 mL/min/1.73 m2 in 53 (49.5%), 55 (51.4%), 50 (50.5%), 50 (51%), and 46 (59.7%) patients before HCT, at 100 days, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years. Within the first 100 days after HCT, hypertension was observed in 72% of the patients and was associated with cyclosporine therapy. Most (62.3%) patients had stage 2 hypertension. CAKUT was observed in 33.7% of the patients and was associated with both hypertension (86%) and diminished kidney function but not with AKI.Conlusion: Although AKI, a commonly known HCT complication, was mild in this study, the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD), as well as the high incidence of hypertension, specially associated with CAKUT point out the importance of kidney care in short and long-term follow up of FA patients. What is Known:   Fanconi anemia (FA) is the most frequent inherited bone marrow failure in children, and 30% of cases have congenital anomalies of kidney (CAKUT).   Acute kidney injury and hypertension after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) may impact the outcomes.. What is New:   Despite the presence of CAKUT and stage 2 CKD in 33.7% and 50% of the patients, respectively, AKI was mild and transitory after HCT in FA patients.   CAKUT in FA patients was associated with lower kidney function and hypertension after HCT.",

We retrospectively evaluated outcomes of thirty patients with FA and MDS/AML who underwent first allogeneic HCT with a T-cell depleted (TCD) graft at our institution. Patients were transplanted on successive protocols with stepwise changes in cytoreduction and GVHD prophylaxis. All but two patients (93%) experienced durable hematopoietic engraftment. With median follow-up of 8.7 years, 5-year OS was 66.8% and DFS 53.8%. No significant differences in survival were found in patients with high-risk prognostic features (age >=20 years, AML diagnosis, alternative donor graft) or when stratified by conditioning regimen. The 5-year cumulative incidences of relapse and NRM were 24.3% and 21.9%, respectively. NRM was higher in patients >=20 years at HCT but did not otherwise differ. We herein demonstrate promising outcomes following allogeneic HCT for patients with FA and MDS/AML using TCD grafts, particularly in a cohort of high-risk patients with 50% >=20 years and a majority receiving mismatched grafts. Future prospective studies are needed to compare this approach with other HCT platforms.",

Over the last two decades, HSCT outcomes have improved dramatically following the development of regimens tailored for FA patients. In this study, we analyzed genetic, clinical, and transplant data of 41 patients with FA who underwent HSCT at Hadassah Medical Center between November 1996 and September 2020. Overall survival (OS) was 82.9% with a median follow-up time of 2.11-years (95% CI, .48-16.56). Thirteen patients (31.7%) developed acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), three of them with grades 3-4. Nine patients developed chronic GVHD, five had extensive disease. Twelve patients (29.3%) developed stable mixed-chimerism with complete resolution of bone marrow failure (BMF); none of them had acute nor chronic GVHD. Significantly higher GVHD rates were observed in transplants from peripheral blood stem cell grafts as compared to other stem cell sources (p = .002 for acute and p = .004 for chronic GVHD). Outcome parameters were comparable between HSCT from matched-sibling (n = 20) to other donors (n = 21), including survival rates (p = .1), time to engraftment (p = .69 and p = .14 for neutrophil and platelet engraftment time, respectively), chimerism status (p = .36 and p = .83 for full-donor and mixed chimerism, respectively), and GVHD prevalence (p = 1). Our results demonstrate the vast improvements in HSCT outcomes of patients with FA, narrowing the gap between matched-sibling versus alternative donor transplantations. Our data identifies factors that may significantly affect transplant outcomes such as graft source and chimerism status.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a critical condition characterized by a dysregulated immune response to infection, often resulting in organ dysfunction. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a key proinflammatory cytokine associated with sepsis and its complications. This case study explored the use of Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT) combined with Cytosorb in managing pediatric patients with leukemia, severe thrombocytopenia, and elevated IL-6 levels. CASE PRESENTATION: A 10-year-old boy with Fanconi anemia presented with pancytopenia, fever, and necrotic lesions, indicative of mucormycosis. Following the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the patient experienced severe complications, including septic shock. Despite appropriate treatment, inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), and IL-6, were significantly elevated. CRRT with Cytosorb was initiated to manage hypercytokinemia and improve the patient's clinical status. INTERVENTION: The CRRT procedure utilizes citrate as an anticoagulant because of severe thrombocytopenia. The treatment lasted for 20 h, during which the inflammatory biomarkers were monitored. The post-treatment results indicated a significant reduction in IL-6 levels within 24 h and a decrease in PCT levels at 8 h. CRP levels gradually declined over 40 h. OUTCOME: The patient exhibited marked clinical improvement, with significant healing of cutaneous lesions and stabilization of inflammatory markers, allowing transfer to the ward for continued chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: This case suggests that CRRT combined with cytosorb may be a valuable adjunctive therapy for managing complex cases of septic shock. The observed reduction in inflammatory markers, particularly IL-6, warrants further investigation. Concurrent antimicrobial, antifungal, and dexamethasone treatments for IRIS may have influenced the observed outcomes in this single case. Controlled studies are needed to evaluate the specific contribution of Cytosorb-CRRT and assess its long-term efficacy and safety in similar patient populations, particularly in resource-limited settings.

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) is a well-established curative treatment to correct the hematological manifestations but does not halt or reverse the nonhematological complications and may hasten them. With advances in HCT and in our ability to care for patients with IBMFS, an increasing number of survivors are making it imperative to not only diagnose but also treat late effects from the pre-, peri-, and post-HCT course and complications relating to the natural history of the syndrome. As the field of HCT evolves to allow for the incorporation of alternate graft sources, for expansion of donor options to include unrelated and mismatched donors, and for use of reduced-intensity conditioning or reduced toxicity myeloablative regimens, we have yet to determine if these advances modify the disease-specific course. While long-term outcomes of these patients are often included under one umbrella, this article seeks to address disease-specific post-HCT outcomes within IBMFS.",

Thus, management of this multisystem disorder has previously been unfamiliar to many hematologists specializing in the care of adolescents and young adults (AYA). The increased diagnosis of FA in AYA patients, facilitated by widely available germline genomic testing, improved long-term survival of children with FA following matched sibling and alternative donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) performed for BMF, and expanding need in the near future for long-term monitoring in patients achieving hematologic stabilization following ex vivo gene therapy are all reasons why management of FA in AYA populations deserves specific consideration. In this review, we address the unique challenges and evidence-based practice recommendations for the management of AYA patients with FA. Specific topics addressed include hematologic monitoring in AYA patients yet to undergo HSCT, management of myeloid malignancies occurring in FA, diagnosis and management of nonhematologic malignances and organ dysfunction in AYA patients with FA, and evolving considerations for the long-term monitoring of patients with FA undergoing gene therapy.",

                    "abstract": "Fanconi anemia (FA) is an inherited DNA repair disorder characterized by bone marrow (BM) failure, developmental abnormalities, myelodysplasia, and leukemia and solid tumor predisposition. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), a mainstay treatment, is limited by conditioning regimen-related toxicity and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Antibody-drug-conjugates (ADCs) targeting hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) can open marrow niches permitting donor stem cell alloengraftment. Here, we report that single dose anti-mouse CD45-targeted-ADC (CD45-ADC) facilitated stable, multilineage chimerism in 3 distinct FA mouse models representing 90% of FA complementation groups. CD45-ADC profoundly depleted host stem cell enriched Lineage Sca1+cKit+ cells within 48 hours. Fanca-/- recipients of minor-mismatched BM and single dose CD45-ADC had peripheral blood (PB) mean donor chimerism >90%; donor HSCs alloengraftment was verified in secondary recipients. In Fancc-/- and Fancg-/- recipients of fully allogeneic grafts, PB mean donor chimerism was 60-80% and 70-80%, respectively. The mean percent donor chimerism in BM and spleen mirrored PB results. CD45-ADC conditioned mice did not have clinical toxicity. A transient <2.5-fold increase in hepatocellular enzymes and mild-to-moderate histopathological changes were seen. Under GVHD allo-HSCT conditions, wildtype and Fanca-/- recipients of CD45-ADC had markedly reduced GVHD lethality compared to lethal irradiation. Moreover, single dose anti-human CD45-ADC given to rhesus macaque nonhuman primates on days -6 or -10 was at least as myeloablative as lethal irradiation. These data suggest that CD45-ADC can potently promote donor alloengraftment and hematopoiesis without significant toxicity or severe GVHD, as seen with lethal irradiation, providing strong support for clinical trial considerations in highly vulnerable FA patients.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Outcome of children with medulloblastoma (MB) and Fanconi Anemia (FA), an inherited DNA repair deficiency, has not been described systematically. Treatment is complicated by high vulnerability to treatment-associated side effects, yet structured data are lacking. This study aims at giving a comprehensive overview about clinical and molecular characteristics of pediatric FA MB patients. METHODS: Clinical data including detailed information on treatment and toxicities of six previously unreported FA MB patients were supplemented with data of 16 published cases. RESULTS: We identified 22 cases of children with FA and MB with clinical data available. All MBs with subgroup reporting were SHH-activated (n=9), confirmed by methylation profiling in five patients. FA MB patients exclusively belonged to complementation groups FA-D1 (n=16) or FA-N (n=3). Patients were treated with postoperative chemotherapy only (50%) or radiotherapy (RT)+-chemotherapy (27%). 23% did not receive adjuvant therapy. Excessive treatment-related toxicities were frequent. Severe hematological toxicity occurred in 91% of patients treated with alkylating chemotherapy, while non-alkylating agents and RT were less toxic. Median overall survival (OS) was 1 year (95%CI 0.3-1.8). 1-year-progression-free-survival (PFS) was 26.3+-10.1% and 1-year-OS was 42.1+-11.3%. Adjuvant therapy prolonged survival (1y-OS/1y-PFS 0%/0% without adjuvant therapy vs. 53.3+-12.9%/33.3+-12.2% with adjuvant therapy, p=0.006/p=0.086). CONCLUSIONS: MB in FA patients is strongly associated with SHH activation and FA-D1/FA-N. Despite the dismal prognosis, adjuvant therapy may prolong survival. Non-alkylating chemotherapy and RT are feasible in selected patients with careful monitoring of toxicities and dose adjustments. Curative therapy for FA MB-SHH remains an unmet medical need.",

This CPS is focused on the risk of secondary oral cancer following hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). METHODS: This CPS was developed based on critical evaluation of the literature followed by a structured discussion of a group of leading experts, members of the Oral Care Study Group of MASCC/ISOO. The information is presented in the form of succinct bullets to generate a short manual about the best standard of care. RESULTS: Studies described a 7-16-fold higher risk of secondary oral cancer (mainly squamous cell carcinoma) in allogeneic HCT (alloHCT) recipients, particularly in those who developed chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD). Risk increases over time and is influenced by several risk factors. In autologous HCT, oral cancer risk seemed only slightly elevated. CONCLUSION: Clinicians should be aware of the higher oral cancer risk in alloHCT survivors, and emphasize the importance of lifelong oral cancer surveillance (at least every 6-12 months) and avoiding cancer promoting lifestyle factors in an empathic way, particularly of those with (a history of) cGVHD. Post-HCT for Fanconi anemia or dyskeratosis congenita, education and rigorous follow-up is even more crucial. In case of suspected oral lesions in the presence of oral mucosal cGVHD, a GVHD intervention may facilitate diagnosis. Suspected lesions should be biopsied. More research is needed on the role of HPV in oral cancer post-HCT.",

PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors upregulate T-cell killing of cancer cells and is a class of promising treatment for FA-AML. Here, we developed a novel FA-AML murine model that allows the study of human AML with a humanized immune system in order to investigate immunotherapeutic treatments in vivo. FA-AML1 cells and non-FA-mutated Kasumi-1 cells were injected into 8-10 week old NSG mice. Once leukemic engraftment was confirmed by HLA-DR expression in the peripheral blood, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMCs) were injected into the mice. One week post-hPBMCs injection, Nivolumab (PD-1 inhibitor) or PBS vehicle control was administered to the mice bi-weekly. In our Nivolumab treated mice, FA-AML1, but not Kasumi-1-engrafted mice, had significantly prolonged overall survival. Both FA-AML1 and Kasumi-1 engrafted mice had decreased spleen weights. Higher leukemic infiltration into vital organs was observed in FA-AML1 engrafted mice compared to Kasumi-1 engrafted mice. In conclusion, our novel humanized murine model of FA-mutated AML is an attractive tool for supporting further studies and clinical trials using PD-1 inhibitors to treat FA-mutated AML.",

Thus, management of this multisystem disorder has previously been unfamiliar to many hematologists specializing in the care of adolescents and young adults (AYA). The increased diagnosis of FA in AYA patients, facilitated by widely available germline genomic testing, improved long-term survival of children with FA following matched sibling and alternative donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) performed for BMF, and expanding need in the near future for long-term monitoring in patients achieving hematologic stabilization following ex vivo gene therapy are all reasons why management of FA in AYA populations deserves specific consideration. In this review, we address the unique challenges and evidence-based practice recommendations for the management of AYA patients with FA. Specific topics addressed include hematologic monitoring in AYA patients yet to undergo HSCT, management of myeloid malignancies occurring in FA, diagnosis and management of nonhematologic malignances and organ dysfunction in AYA patients with FA, and evolving considerations for the long-term monitoring of patients with FA undergoing gene therapy.",

Calcineurin inhibitors are medications commonly used for long periods in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) and solid organ transplantation. Medication-related fibrovascular hyperplasia (MRFH) is an extra gingival hyperplastic nodular growth associated with medications use. This study reports five cases of pediatric patients (6 to 12-years-old) diagnosed with Fanconi anemia (FA) after HSCT who presented similar oral mucosal lesions associated with the use of cyclosporine, phenobarbital and amlodipine. After excision of the lesions, histopathological analysis described them as pyogenic granuloma (PG). As the aetiology of the lesions manifested by the patients was associated with the use of medications, the final diagnosis was MRFH. Despite the clinical and histopathological similarity between PG and MRFH, it is fundamental to know the aetiological agent for achieving definitive diagnosis and correct management. Considering the etiologic agent (medication) and histopathological findings, it is suggested that the most appropriate term for this manifestation should be \"medication-related fibrovascular hyperplasia\". The correct nomenclature related to extra gingival hyperplastic lesions identified in patients on medications with potential to induce hyperplastic reactions should be adopted to facilitate scientific communication and improve the treatment.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) remains the only available curative treatment for Fanconi Anemia (FA), with particularly favorable outcomes reported after matched sibling donor (MSD) transplant. OBJECTIVES: To describe outcomes, with a special focus on late complications, in FA patients who underwent umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT). STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of allogeneic UCBT for FA performed between 1988 and 2021 in European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) affiliated centers. RESULTS: A total of 205 FA patients underwent UCBT (55 related and 150 unrelated) across 77 transplant centers. Indications for UCBT were bone marrow failure in 190 patients and acute leukemia/myelodysplasia in 15 patients. Median age at transplant was 9 (1.2-43) years, with only 20 patients over the age of 18. Among the donor-recipient pairs, 56% (n=116) had 0-1/6 HLA mismatch. Limited field radiotherapy was administered to 28% (n=58) and 78% (n=160) received a Fludarabine (FLU)-based conditioning regimen. Serotherapy consisted of anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG, n=159; 78%) or alemtuzumab (n=12; 6%). Median follow-up was 10 years for related and 7 years for unrelated UCBT. Excellent outcomes were observed in the setting of related UCBT, including a 60-day cumulative incidence (CI) of neutrophil recovery at 98.1% (93.9-100), a 100-day CI of grades II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) at 17.3% (9.5-31.6), and a 5-year CI of chronic GVHD at 22.7% (13.3-38.7; 13% extensive). Five-year overall survival (OS) was 88%. In multivariate analysis, none of the factors included in the model predicted a better OS. In unrelated UCBT, the 60-day CI of neutrophil recovery was 78.7% (71.9-86.3), the 100-day CI of grade II-IV aGVHD was 31.4% (24.6-40.2) and the 5-year CI of cGVHD was 24.3% (17.8-32.2) (12% extensive). Five-year OS was 44%. In multivariate analysis, negative recipient CMV serology, FLU-based conditioning, age at UCBT less than 9 years and 0-1/6 HLA mismatch were associated with improved OS. A total of 106 patients, including 5 AL/MDS, survived for over 2 years after UCBT. Nine of these patients developed subsequent neoplasms (SN), including one donor-derived AML and 8 solid tumors, at a median of 9.7 (2.3-21.8) years post-UCBT (one related and 8 unrelated UCBT). In a subset of 49 patients with available data, late non-malignant complications affecting various organ systems were observed at a median of 8.7 (2.7-28.8) years post-UCBT. CONCLUSION: UCB is a valid source of stem cells for transplantation in patients with FA, with best results observed after related UCBT. After unrelated UCBT, improved survival was observed in patients transplanted at a younger age, with FLU-based conditioning and better HLA parity. The incidence of organ specific complications and subsequent neoplasms was relatively low. Subsequent neoplasm incidence, mostly squamous cell carcinoma, increases with time.

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: The DNA damage immune response (DDIR) assay was developed in breast cancer based on biology associated with deficiencies in homologous recombination and Fanconi anemia pathways. A positive DDIR call identifies patients likely to respond to platinum-based chemotherapies in breast and esophageal cancers. In colorectal cancer, there is currently no biomarker to predict response to oxaliplatin. We tested the ability of the DDIR assay to predict response to oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in colorectal cancer and characterized the biology in DDIR-positive colorectal cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Samples and clinical data were assessed according to DDIR status from patients who received either 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or 5FUFA (bolus and infusion 5-FU with folinic acid) plus oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) within the FOCUS trial (n = 361, stage IV), or neoadjuvant FOLFOX in the FOxTROT trial (n = 97, stage II/III). Whole transcriptome, mutation, and IHC data of these samples were used to interrogate the biology of DDIR in colorectal cancer. RESULTS: Contrary to our hypothesis, DDIR-negative patients displayed a trend toward improved outcome for oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy compared with DDIR-positive patients. DDIR positivity was associated with microsatellite instability (MSI) and colorectal molecular subtype 1. Refinement of the DDIR signature, based on overlapping IFN-related chemokine signaling associated with DDIR positivity across colorectal cancer and breast cancer cohorts, further confirmed that the DDIR assay did not have predictive value for oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in colorectal cancer. CONCLUSIONS: DDIR positivity does not predict improved response following oxaliplatin treatment in colorectal cancer. However, data presented here suggest the potential of the DDIR assay in identifying immune-rich tumors that may benefit from immune checkpoint blockade, beyond current use of MSI status.",

FA is caused by a defective repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks and to date, mutations in over 20 genes have been linked to the disease. Advances in science and molecular biology have provided new insight between FA gene mutations and the severity of clinical manifestations. Here, we will highlight the current and promising therapeutic options for this rare disease. The current standard treatment for FA patients is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, a treatment associated to exposure to radiation or chemotherapy, immunological complications, plus opportunistic infections from prolonged immune incompetence or increased risk of morbidity. New arising treatments include gene addition therapy, genome editing using CRISPR-Cas9 nuclease, and hematopoietic stem cell generation from induced pluripotent stem cells. Finally, we will also discuss the revolutionary developments in mRNA therapeutics as an opportunity for this disease.",

The available management strategies for these disorders are still unsatisfactory and do not eliminate the main causes. As genetic aberrations are the main causes of all forms of hereditary anemia, the optimal approach involves repairing the defective gene, possibly through the transplantation of normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from a normal matching donor or through gene therapy approaches (either in vivo or ex vivo) to correct the patient's HSCs. To clearly illustrate the importance of cell and gene therapy in hereditary anemia, this paper provides a review of the genetic aberration, epidemiology, clinical features, current management, and cell and gene therapy endeavors related to SCD, thalassemia, Fanconi anemia, and G6PDD. Moreover, we expound the future research direction of HSC derivation from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), strategies to edit HSCs, gene therapy risk mitigation, and their clinical perspectives. In conclusion, gene-corrected hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has promising outcomes for SCD, Fanconi anemia, and thalassemia, and it may overcome the limitation of the source of allogenic bone marrow transplantation.",

                    "abstract": "The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 system has revolutionized the gene editing field, making it possible to interrupt, insert or replace a sequence of interest with high precision in the human genome. Its easy design and wide applicability open up a variety of therapeutic alternatives for the treatment of genetic diseases. Indeed, very promising approaches for the correction of hematological disorders have been developed in the recent years, based on the self-renewal and multipotent differentiation properties of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, which make this cell subset the ideal target for gene therapy purposes. This technology has been applied in different congenital blood disorders, such as primary immunodeficiencies, X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency, X-linked chronic granulomatous disease or Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, and inherited bone marrow failure syndromes, such as Fanconi anemia, congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia or severe congenital neutropenia. Furthermore, CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing has been implemented successfully as a novel therapy for cancer immunotherapy, by the development of promising strategies such as the use of oncolytic viruses or adoptive cellular therapy to the chimeric antigen receptor-T-cell therapy. Therefore, considering the variety of genes and mutations affected, we can take advantage of the different DNA repair mechanisms by CRISPR/Cas9 in different manners, from homology-directed repair to non-homologous-end-joining to the latest emerging technologies such as base and prime editing. Although the delivery systems into hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells are still the bottleneck of this technology, some of the advances in genome editing shown in this review have already reached a clinical stage and show very promising preliminary results.",

                    "abstract": "Fanconi anemia (FA) is a disease caused by defective deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair that manifests as bone marrow failure, cancer predisposition, and developmental defects. We previously reported that monotherapy with either metformin (MET) or oxymetholone (OXM) improved peripheral blood (PB) counts and the number and functionality of bone marrow hematopoietic stem progenitor cells (HSPCs) number in Fancd2-/- mice. To evaluate whether the combination treatment of these drugs has a synergistic effect to prevent bone marrow failure in FA, we treated cohorts of Fancd2-/- mice and wildtype controls with either MET alone, OXM alone, MET+OXM, or placebo diet from age 3 weeks to 18 months. The OXM treated animals showed modest improvements in blood parameters including platelet count (p = .01) and hemoglobin levels (p < .05). In addition, the percentage of quiescent hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) (LSK [Lin-Sca+c-Kit+]) was significantly increased (p = .001) by long-term treatment with MET alone. The combination of metformin and oxymetholone did not result in a significant synergistic effect in any hematopoietic parameter. Gene expression analysis of liver tissue from these animals showed that some of the expression changes caused by Fancd2 deletion were partially normalized by metformin treatment. Importantly, no adverse effects of the individual or combination therapies were observed, despite the long-term administration. We conclude that androgen therapy is not a contraindication to concurrent metformin administration in clinical trials. HIGHLIGHTS: Long-term coadministration of metformin in combination with oxymetholone is well tolerated by Fancd2-/- mice. Hematopoietic stem cell quiescence in mutant mice was enhanced by treatment with metformin alone. Metformin treatment caused a partial normalization of gene expression in the livers of mutant mice.",

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to explore the mechanism by which HBO treats spinal cord injury (SCI) at the level of lncRNAs. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Immense amounts of research have established that HBO treatment promotes the recovery of neurological function after SCI. The mechanism of action remains to be clarified. METHODS: High-throughput RNA sequencing, Gene Ontology, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis were used to profile lncRNA expression and analyze biological function in the spinal cords of mice from sham-operated, SCI, and HBO-treated groups. The differential expression of lncRNA between the groups was assessed using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Differential expression across 577 lncRNAs was identified among the three groups. GO analysis showed that free ubiquitin chain polymerization, ubiquitin homeostasis, DNA replication, synthesis of RNA primer, single-stranded telomeric DNA binding, and alpha-amylase activity were significantly enriched. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis displayed that vitamin B6 metabolism, one carbon pool by folate, DNA replication, lysine degradation, beta-alanine metabolism, fanconi anemia pathway, and Notch signal pathway were the main pathways with enrichment significance. LncRNAs NONMMUT 092674.1, NONMMUT042986.2, and NONMMUT018850.2 showed significantly different expression between the SCI and the other two groups (P<0.05, <0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to determine the expression profiles of lncRNAs in the injured spinal cord after HBO treatment. We identified several important dysregulated lncRNAs in this setting. These results help us better understand the mechanism by which HBO treats SCI and provide new potential therapeutic targets for SCI.",

The clinical application of techniques that modify the expression of a gene is called gene therapy (GT). These techniques include platforms (viral and non-viral) that bring genetic modification systems or healthy genes to the target cells. ClinicalTrial.gov is a repository of clinical trials that incorporates protocols using TG. In this work, a systematic review of the works registered in ClinicalTrial.gov on the use of TG in hematological diseases was carried out. A total of 41 GT-related clinical trials were found most of which were registered in the United States of America (56.1%). On the other hand, 41.46% of the protocols obtained private funding. Of 50% of all pathologies, only diseases of hematological origin of monogenic origin (hemophilia A, hemophilia B, and Fanconi anemia) received TG. On the other hand, the number of clinical protocols registered by country was positively correlated with economic development, scientific development, investment in health per capita, and quality of life. Finally, there are still many bioethical, social, political, and economic controversies that must be solved.",

The available management strategies for these disorders are still unsatisfactory and do not eliminate the main causes. As genetic aberrations are the main causes of all forms of hereditary anemia, the optimal approach involves repairing the defective gene, possibly through the transplantation of normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from a normal matching donor or through gene therapy approaches (either in vivo or ex vivo) to correct the patient's HSCs. To clearly illustrate the importance of cell and gene therapy in hereditary anemia, this paper provides a review of the genetic aberration, epidemiology, clinical features, current management, and cell and gene therapy endeavors related to SCD, thalassemia, Fanconi anemia, and G6PDD. Moreover, we expound the future research direction of HSC derivation from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), strategies to edit HSCs, gene therapy risk mitigation, and their clinical perspectives. In conclusion, gene-corrected hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has promising outcomes for SCD, Fanconi anemia, and thalassemia, and it may overcome the limitation of the source of allogenic bone marrow transplantation.",

METHODS: According to the inclusion criteria, we selected 395 DNA samples from NSCLC patients for genotyping and combined with clinical data for Cox regression analysis and stratification analyses to assess relationships between overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) with SNPs genotypes. RESULTS: The results revealed that patients with FANCE rs6907678 TT genotype have a longer OS than TC and CC genotype (Additive model: P = 0.004, HR = 1.696, 95% CI = 1.186-2.425). In stratification analyses, Longer PFS is found in female, age <= 55 years old and non-smoking patients with FANCE rs6907678 TT genotype, and patients with TT genotypes were significantly had longer OS in male, age >55 years old, non-smoking, squamous cell carcinoma and stage IV stratification. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrates that patients with FANCE rs6907678 TT genotype are contributed to better prognosis. FANCE rs6907678 may be used as a clinical biomarker for predicting the prognosis of NSCLC patients with platinum-based chemotherapy.",

Thus, management of this multisystem disorder has previously been unfamiliar to many hematologists specializing in the care of adolescents and young adults (AYA). The increased diagnosis of FA in AYA patients, facilitated by widely available germline genomic testing, improved long-term survival of children with FA following matched sibling and alternative donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) performed for BMF, and expanding need in the near future for long-term monitoring in patients achieving hematologic stabilization following ex vivo gene therapy are all reasons why management of FA in AYA populations deserves specific consideration. In this review, we address the unique challenges and evidence-based practice recommendations for the management of AYA patients with FA. Specific topics addressed include hematologic monitoring in AYA patients yet to undergo HSCT, management of myeloid malignancies occurring in FA, diagnosis and management of nonhematologic malignances and organ dysfunction in AYA patients with FA, and evolving considerations for the long-term monitoring of patients with FA undergoing gene therapy.",

Of the 31 patients with SAA, 19 had acquired aplastic anemia, 2 had Diamond Blackfan anemia and 10 had Fanconi anemia. Donors were either matched sibling (n=29), related donors (n=2), or unrelated donors (n=3). Peripheral blood stem cells were the graft source in all the cases except 1. Fludarabine-based reduced intensity conditioning was used in all except for patients with a diagnosis of Diamond Blackfan anemia. All patients except 1 achieved hematologic recovery in the form of neutrophil engraftment at 13 days (range, 9 to 17), whereas platelet engraftment occurred at 14 days (range, 10 to 18). Graft versus host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine and methotrexate +-antithymocyte globulin (horse/rabbit). Acute GvHD developed in 12.9% patients, whereas no patients developed chronic GvHD till the time of last follow-up. The 2-year overall survival for the entire cohort was 93.21+-4.6%.

                    "abstract": "Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare and complex genetic disorder, clinically characterized by bone marrow failure, congenital defects, and cancer predisposition. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) represents the only therapeutic option to restore normal hematopoiesis after the occurrence of marrow failure or clonal hematopoietic abnormality. However, radiation exposure during transplant may increase the risk of later malignancies. In this retrospective study, we analyzed the results of HSCT with a radiation-free, busulfan-based conditioning regimen in FA patients. A total of 122 patients (median age: 8 years, range: 2-18 years) with FA who underwent HSCT between January 2008 and January 2020 were enrolled in this study and followed up to the end of 2020. The preparative regimen included busulfan (0.2 mg/kg/day, days -9 to -6), cyclophosphamide (15 mg/kg/day, days -5 to -2), and in vivo T-cell depletion with rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin. All patients received graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis with cyclosporine combined with methotrexate. We used the Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test, and Cox proportional hazards models to analyze patient survival. Peripheral blood, bone marrow and cord blood hematopoietic stem cells were used in 84 (68.9%), 31 (25.4%) and 7 (5.7%) patients, respectively. Donors were matched siblings in 48 (39.3%), matched other relatives in 56 (45.9%), and matched unrelated persons in 18 (14.8%) patients. With a median follow-up time of 24.25 months, graft rejection occurred in only one patient. The 1- and 5-year overall survival rates were 84.14% (95% confidence interval: 76.02-89.70) and 82.16% (95% confidence interval: 73.01-88.45), respectively. Of the patient characteristics documented before transplant, the presence of cardiopulmonary, genitourinary tract, central nervous system, and limb malformations significantly affected survival rates. Our results indicate excellent outcomes in patients with FA undergoing HSCT with a radiation-free, busulfan-based conditioning regimen. It would be desirable to aim at optimizing the outcome of HSCT in FA patients in future studies.",

This CPS is focused on the risk of secondary oral cancer following hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). METHODS: This CPS was developed based on critical evaluation of the literature followed by a structured discussion of a group of leading experts, members of the Oral Care Study Group of MASCC/ISOO. The information is presented in the form of succinct bullets to generate a short manual about the best standard of care. RESULTS: Studies described a 7-16-fold higher risk of secondary oral cancer (mainly squamous cell carcinoma) in allogeneic HCT (alloHCT) recipients, particularly in those who developed chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD). Risk increases over time and is influenced by several risk factors. In autologous HCT, oral cancer risk seemed only slightly elevated. CONCLUSION: Clinicians should be aware of the higher oral cancer risk in alloHCT survivors, and emphasize the importance of lifelong oral cancer surveillance (at least every 6-12 months) and avoiding cancer promoting lifestyle factors in an empathic way, particularly of those with (a history of) cGVHD. Post-HCT for Fanconi anemia or dyskeratosis congenita, education and rigorous follow-up is even more crucial. In case of suspected oral lesions in the presence of oral mucosal cGVHD, a GVHD intervention may facilitate diagnosis. Suspected lesions should be biopsied. More research is needed on the role of HPV in oral cancer post-HCT.",

Due to DNA instability in FA, RIC has been used to decrease immediate and late complications of HSCT. Most FA conditioning regimens in mismatched and unrelated donor transplants rely on TBI, which increases the risk of secondary malignancies. Most of the non-TBI conditioning regimens use an ex vivo T-cell depletion approach, but this is not feasible at all pediatric stem cell transplant programs. To evaluate the success of HSCT in patients with FA using non-TBI conditioning regimens with in vivo T-cell depletion approach. HSCT using non-TBI based conditioning was performed on two siblings with FA. The first sibling underwent matched unrelated donor transplant with a BM graft using fludarabine, alemtuzumab, busulfan, and cyclophosphamide conditioning and cyclosporine and mycophenolate as GVHD prophylaxis. The second sibling underwent MSD transplant with UCB and BM grafts using similar approach, but without busulfan and mycophenolate. Both siblings had engraftment without signs of acute or chronic GVHD. Acute post-transplant complications included brief viral reactivations. At last follow-up, both siblings continued to have full immune reconstitution with stable chimerism. Conditioning regimens without radiation and inclusion of alemtuzumab can lead to successful engraftment without development of GVHD and reduce risk of developing secondary neoplasms, even with unrelated donor transplants.",

We retrospectively evaluated outcomes of thirty patients with FA and MDS/AML who underwent first allogeneic HCT with a T-cell depleted (TCD) graft at our institution. Patients were transplanted on successive protocols with stepwise changes in cytoreduction and GVHD prophylaxis. All but two patients (93%) experienced durable hematopoietic engraftment. With median follow-up of 8.7 years, 5-year OS was 66.8% and DFS 53.8%.

The 5-year cumulative incidences of relapse and NRM were 24.3% and 21.9%, respectively. NRM was higher in patients >=20 years at HCT but did not otherwise differ. We herein demonstrate promising outcomes following allogeneic HCT for patients with FA and MDS/AML using TCD grafts, particularly in a cohort of high-risk patients with 50% >=20 years and a majority receiving mismatched grafts.

                    "abstract": "Fanconi anemia is the most common inherited bone marrow failure syndrome, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative option. Post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) is challenging in this group of children, given their increased sensitivity to chemotherapy. We performed a retrospective analysis of the data on children diagnosed with Fanconi anemia who underwent a haploidentical HSCT with PTCy from January 2014 to December 2019. Nineteen children (male/female, 0.75:1) underwent 21 haplo-HSCTs with PTCy. Fludarabine, low-dose cyclophosphamide, and 200 centi-gray total body irradiation were included in the conditioning regimen with 25 mg/kg PTCy on days +3 and +4. Haplo-graft was from a sibling in 38% and father in 57% of transplants. The source of stem cells was peripheral blood stem cells in 81% and bone marrow in 19% of transplants, with a median CD34 dose of 5.0 x 106/kg. We documented engraftment in 84% and primary graft failure in 10% of transplants. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) was infused concomitantly during cyclophosphamide in 13 children. Grade 2 and 3 mucositis was lower among those who received NAC as compared to those who did not (30% and 15% versus 33% and 50%), while transaminitis was higher among those who did not receive the infusion. The incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was 68%, and 81% of these were steroid responsive (grade I/II). We documented chronic GVHD in 25% children, predominantly involving the skin and mouth, which responded to low-dose steroids and ruxolitinib. Serum ferritin was monitored twice weekly as a surrogate marker for cytokine release syndrome due to nonavailability of IL-6 levels. A 1- or 2-log increase in the titers of ferritin associated with clinical features guided the early addition of steroids in the periengraftment period. The mean survival was found to be less among those with high serum ferritin (>10,000 ng/dL) in the periengraftment period as compared to those with ferritin <10,000 ng/dL (mean survival of 25 +- 10 months versus 50 +- 6 months, respectively). The overall survival in our cohort was 68.4%, with a mean survival time of 41.5 months (95% confidence interval, 29.3 to 53.8 months), with a statistically significant correlation between inferior outcome and having received over 15 transfusions before HSCT (P = .01). PTCy can be considered a viable option in children with Fanconi anemia, particularly in resource-limited settings given the high costs of HSCTs. Focused interventions in this subset of children help improve survival outcomes. Early identification of cytokine release syndrome and risk-adapted steroid therapy during engraftment helps prevent mortality. The concomitant use of NAC during cyclophosphamide infusion helps reduce oxygen free radical related tissue damage and regimen-related toxicity.",

This retrospective study, conducted on behalf of the EBMT SAAWP and PDWP, aims to report the current outcomes of haplo-SCT in I-BMFs, comparing the different in vivo and ex vivo T-cell depletion approaches. One hundred and sixty-two I-BMF patients who underwent haplo-SCT (median age 7.4 years) have been registered. Fanconi Anemia was the most represented diagnosis (70.1%). Based on different T-cell depletion (TCD) approaches, four categories were identified: (1) TCRalphabeta+ /CD19+ -depletion (43.8%); (2) T-repleted with post-transplant Cyclophosphamide (PTCy, 34.0%); (3) In-vivo T-depletion with ATG/alemtuzumab (14.8%); (4) CD34+ positive selection (7.4%). The cumulative incidences (CI) of neutrophil and platelet engraftment were 84% and 76% respectively, while that of primary and secondary graft failure was 10% and 8% respectively. The 100-day CI of acute GvHD grade III-IV(95% CI) was 13%, while the 24-month CI of extensive chronic GvHD was 4%. After a median follow-up of 43.4 months, the 2-year overall survival(OS) and GvHD/Rejection-free Survival (GRFS) probabilities are 67% and 53%, respectively. The TCR CD3+ alphabeta+ /CD19+ depletion group showed a significantly lower incidence of both acute and chronic GvHD and higher OS (79%; p0.013) and GRFS (71%; p < .001), while no significant differences in outcomes have been observed by different diagnosis and conditioning regimens. This large retrospective study supports the safety and feasibility of haplo-SCT in I-BMF patients. TCRalphabeta+ /CD19+ depletion offers higher chances of patients' survival, with a significantly lower risk of severe a- and c-GvHD in I-BMFs compared to other platforms.",

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to explore the mechanism by which HBO treats spinal cord injury (SCI) at the level of lncRNAs. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Immense amounts of research have established that HBO treatment promotes the recovery of neurological function after SCI. The mechanism of action remains to be clarified. METHODS: High-throughput RNA sequencing, Gene Ontology, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis were used to profile lncRNA expression and analyze biological function in the spinal cords of mice from sham-operated, SCI, and HBO-treated groups. The differential expression of lncRNA between the groups was assessed using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Differential expression across 577 lncRNAs was identified among the three groups. GO analysis showed that free ubiquitin chain polymerization, ubiquitin homeostasis, DNA replication, synthesis of RNA primer, single-stranded telomeric DNA binding, and alpha-amylase activity were significantly enriched. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis displayed that vitamin B6 metabolism, one carbon pool by folate, DNA replication, lysine degradation, beta-alanine metabolism, fanconi anemia pathway, and Notch signal pathway were the main pathways with enrichment significance. LncRNAs NONMMUT 092674.1, NONMMUT042986.2, and NONMMUT018850.2 showed significantly different expression between the SCI and the other two groups (P<0.05, <0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to determine the expression profiles of lncRNAs in the injured spinal cord after HBO treatment. We identified several important dysregulated lncRNAs in this setting. These results help us better understand the mechanism by which HBO treats SCI and provide new potential therapeutic targets for SCI.",

The increased diagnosis of FA in AYA patients, facilitated by widely available germline genomic testing, improved long-term survival of children with FA following matched sibling and alternative donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) performed for BMF, and expanding need in the near future for long-term monitoring in patients achieving hematologic stabilization following ex vivo gene therapy are all reasons why management of FA in AYA populations deserves specific consideration. In this review, we address the unique challenges and evidence-based practice recommendations for the management of AYA patients with FA. Specific topics addressed include hematologic monitoring in AYA patients yet to undergo HSCT, management of myeloid malignancies occurring in FA, diagnosis and management of nonhematologic malignances and organ dysfunction in AYA patients with FA, and evolving considerations for the long-term monitoring of patients with FA undergoing gene therapy.",

GR risk factors are well published, but there are no reliable biomarkers or therapies known. Fever is the most common symptom of GR, but no study has evaluated fever kinetics as a diagnostic marker of GR. The objectives of this study were to identify mechanisms, biomarkers, and potential therapies for GR after HCT. Chemokine ligand 9 (CXCL9), B-cell activating factor (BAFF), and complement markers (sC5b-9, C3a, and C5a) were measured in 7 patients with GR and compared with 15 HCT controls. All patients had a diagnosis of aplastic anemia, Fanconi anemia, or genetically undefined chromosomal fragility syndrome. All patients with GR were febrile during GR; therefore, control patients who underwent HCT were matched for diagnosis and early fevers after HCT. Patients withh GR had significantly higher CXCL9, BAFF, and sC5b-9 at the time of fever and GR compared with control patients who underwent HCT at the time of fever. The maximum fever was significantly higher and occurred significantly later in the transplant course in patients with GR compared with febrile HCT controls. These data support the use of CXCL9, BAFF, sC5b-9, and fever kinetics as GR markers. Two patients with GR underwent a second HCT that was complicated by high fevers. Both patients received interferon and complement blockers during their second HCT, and both preserved their graft. These laboratory and clinical findings support larger studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of interferon, complement, and BAFF inhibitors for the prevention and treatment of GR after HCT.",

                    "abstract": "Fanconi anemia (FA) is an inherited disorder characterized by congenital malformations, bone marrow failure, and malignancies. Hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) is the only proven cure for the hematological complications. FA patients have increased chromosomal instability and aberrant deoxyribonucleic acid repair and thus can only tolerate low doses of chemotherapy or radiation as part of conditioning prior to HCT. Yet, they are still prone to severe regimen related toxicities including hemorrhagic cystitis (HC) from cyclophosphamide (CY). As CYP2B6 is a primary enzyme responsible for the catalyzation of the prodrug form of CY, understanding the association between CYP2B6 genetic variants and HC in FA patients may predict which patients will be more susceptible to developing HC. A descriptive genetic association study was performed to identify genetic variants associated with HC in patients with FA who underwent HCT between 1999 and 2017. All patients received a CY-based preparative regimen and had pretransplant recipient deoxyribonucleic acid available for genomic analysis. Forty FA pediatric patients were eligible for this analysis. They had received HCT from matched sibling donors (n = 6) or alternative donors (n = 34) for marrow failure (n = 38) or myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 2). The incidence of HC was 32.5% which occurred at a median of 32 days (range 20-180) after HCT. 9 patients had a concomitant viral infection (BK virus, n = 8 both adenovirus and BK virus, n = 1). No genetic variants were significantly associated with HC. The top variants were rs2279343 (g.23060A > G), and rs2279344 (g.23280G > A) in the CYP2B6 gene. The incidence of HC among FA patients with the rs2279343 variant was 42% (CI 22%-62%) compared to 20% (CI 0%-40%) among those without the variant (P = .19). The incidence of HC among patients with the variant in rs2279344 was 40% (CI 22%-58%) compared to 10% (CI 0%-28%) among those without (P = .11). No variants in our analysis were statistically associated with HC. The data suggest that CYP2B6 variants may increase the risk for HC in FA patients who received a CY based preparative therapy but these risk variants must be further evaluated in a larger population.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) remains the only available curative treatment for Fanconi Anemia (FA), with particularly favorable outcomes reported after matched sibling donor (MSD) transplant. OBJECTIVES: To describe outcomes, with a special focus on late complications, in FA patients who underwent umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT). STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of allogeneic UCBT for FA performed between 1988 and 2021 in European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) affiliated centers. RESULTS: A total of 205 FA patients underwent UCBT (55 related and 150 unrelated) across 77 transplant centers. Indications for UCBT were bone marrow failure in 190 patients and acute leukemia/myelodysplasia in 15 patients. Median age at transplant was 9 (1.2-43) years, with only 20 patients over the age of 18. Among the donor-recipient pairs, 56% (n=116) had 0-1/6 HLA mismatch. Limited field radiotherapy was administered to 28% (n=58) and 78% (n=160) received a Fludarabine (FLU)-based conditioning regimen. Serotherapy consisted of anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG, n=159; 78%) or alemtuzumab (n=12; 6%). Median follow-up was 10 years for related and 7 years for unrelated UCBT. Excellent outcomes were observed in the setting of related UCBT, including a 60-day cumulative incidence (CI) of neutrophil recovery at 98.1% (93.9-100), a 100-day CI of grades II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) at 17.3% (9.5-31.6), and a 5-year CI of chronic GVHD at 22.7% (13.3-38.7; 13% extensive). Five-year overall survival (OS) was 88%. In multivariate analysis, none of the factors included in the model predicted a better OS. In unrelated UCBT, the 60-day CI of neutrophil recovery was 78.7% (71.9-86.3), the 100-day CI of grade II-IV aGVHD was 31.4% (24.6-40.2) and the 5-year CI of cGVHD was 24.3% (17.8-32.2) (12% extensive). Five-year OS was 44%. In multivariate analysis, negative recipient CMV serology, FLU-based conditioning, age at UCBT less than 9 years and 0-1/6 HLA mismatch were associated with improved OS. A total of 106 patients, including 5 AL/MDS, survived for over 2 years after UCBT. Nine of these patients developed subsequent neoplasms (SN), including one donor-derived AML and 8 solid tumors, at a median of 9.7 (2.3-21.8) years post-UCBT (one related and 8 unrelated UCBT). In a subset of 49 patients with available data, late non-malignant complications affecting various organ systems were observed at a median of 8.7 (2.7-28.8) years post-UCBT. CONCLUSION: UCB is a valid source of stem cells for transplantation in patients with FA, with best results observed after related UCBT. After unrelated UCBT, improved survival was observed in patients transplanted at a younger age, with FLU-based conditioning and better HLA parity. The incidence of organ specific complications and subsequent neoplasms was relatively low. Subsequent neoplasm incidence, mostly squamous cell carcinoma, increases with time. Rigorous follow-up and life-long screening is crucial in Fanconi anemia patients transplant survivors. The long-term complications observed emphasize the need for long-life screening of transplant survivors.",

The diseases are heterogeneous and characterized by developmental abnormalities, progressive marrow failure, and predisposition to cancer. A correct diagnosis allows for appropriate treatment, genetic counseling, and cancer surveillance. The common IBMFSs are Fanconi anemia, dyskeratosis congenita, and Diamond-Blackfan anemia. Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) offers curative treatment of the hematologic complications of IBMFS. Because of the systemic nature of these diseases, transplant strategies are modified to decrease immediate and late toxicities. HCT from HLA-matched related or unrelated donors offers excellent survival for young patients in aplasia. Challenges include the treatment of adults with marrow aplasia, presentation with myeloid malignancy regardless of age, and early detection or treatment of cancer. In this article, I will describe our approach and evaluation of patients transplanted with IBMFS and review most frequent complications before and after transplant.",

Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), the only potentially curative treatment for the hematological complications of FA, may precipitate acute kidney injury (AKI) and hypertension. We retrospectively investigated 107 FA patients who underwent HCT between 2009 and 2017. We investigated the incidence and risk factors of AKI within 100 days after HCT in a cohort of FA patients, and kidney function and hypertension over 2-year follow-up.The incidence of AKI (mainly stage I) was 18.7%. Patients aged >= 11 years at transplantation showed a higher risk of AKI (OR 3.53). The eGFR was 60-90 mL/min/1.73 m2 in 53 (49.5%), 55 (51.4%), 50 (50.5%), 50 (51%), and 46 (59.7%) patients before HCT, at 100 days, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years. Within the first 100 days after HCT, hypertension was observed in 72% of the patients and was associated with cyclosporine therapy. Most (62.3%) patients had stage 2 hypertension. CAKUT was observed in 33.7% of the patients and was associated with both hypertension (86%) and diminished kidney function but not with AKI.Conlusion: Although AKI, a commonly known HCT complication, was mild in this study, the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD), as well as the high incidence of hypertension, specially associated with CAKUT point out the importance of kidney care in short and long-term follow up of FA patients. What is Known:   Fanconi anemia (FA) is the most frequent inherited bone marrow failure in children, and 30% of cases have congenital anomalies of kidney (CAKUT).   Acute kidney injury and hypertension after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) may impact the outcomes.. What is New:   Despite the presence of CAKUT and stage 2 CKD in 33.7% and 50% of the patients, respectively, AKI was mild and transitory after HCT in FA patients.   CAKUT in FA patients was associated with lower kidney function and hypertension after HCT.",

This paper explores common genetic predisposition genes in MDS, including DDX41, CEBPA, and SAMD9/SAMD9L, which are linked to hereditary conditions presenting diagnostic and clinical challenges. It delves into hereditary conditions that affect platelet production and count, such as RUNX1, ETV6, and ANKRD26, detailing their clinical features and how they contribute to an increased risk of MDS. The discussion extends to additional genetic syndromes like GATA2 deficiency, telomere biology disorders, Fanconi anemia, and Li-Fraumeni syndrome, along with new findings on genes like ERG that offer new insights into disease etiology. The importance of genetic counseling in MDS is underscored, outlining its goals, methods for evaluating family history, risk assessment, and the ethical considerations involved. Furthermore, the role of hematopoietic cell transplantation in managing MDS, particularly in patients with germline syndromes, is reviewed, emphasizing the need for optimal donor selection and personalized treatment approaches. This comprehensive overview illustrates the critical role of genetic factors in MDS and highlights the need for continued research and tailored clinical practices to improve patient outcomes.",

Classical IBMFSs primarily include Fanconi anemia with impaired DNA damage repair, dyskeratosis congenita with telomere maintenance dysfunction, and Diamond-Blackfan anemia with aberrant ribosomal protein biosynthesis. Recently, comprehensive genetic analyses have been implemented for the definitive diagnosis of classic IBMFSs, and advances in molecular genetics have led to the identification of novel disorders such as AMeD and MIRAGE syndromes. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), a promising option to overcome impaired hematopoiesis in patients with IBMFSs, does not correct nonhematological defects and may enhance the risk of secondary malignancies. Disease-specific management is necessary because IBMFSs differ in underlying defects and are associated with varying degrees of risk for clonal evolution and early or late complications after HCT. In addition, long-term follow-up is essential to detect complications related to the IBMFS or HCT. This review provides a summary of current clinical practices along with the latest data on HCT in IBMFSs.",

METHODS: exploratory study using a retrospective analysis of 85 records from patients who underwent hematopoietic stem-cell transplants due to Fanconi anemia, developed in a specialize transplant center in the South of Brazil. The results were analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: 73 different diagnoses were found in 9 out of the 13 domains from the NANDA-I taxonomy. From these, 22 were in 50% or more of the patients investigated, and most of them are related to the domain Safety/Protection. CONCLUSIONS: it was possible to identify the nursing diagnosis in the patients who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplants due to Fanconi anemia, contributing to design a plan for the care of these patients. The same was true for those with other syndromes of chromosomal instability that need to undergo this transplant.",

Treatment options include immunosuppressive therapy (IST) and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). OBJECTIVE: To analyze the outcomes of pediatric patients diagnosed with BMF treated in a tertiary care center. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Retrospective study of pediatric patients diagnosed with BMF who consulted at Fundacion Valle de Lili, Cali. Descriptive statistical analysis was performed according to Acquired BMF (ABMF) and Inherited BMF (IBMF). The outcomes include treatment, complications, overall survival (OS) in transplant patients, calculated using the Kaplan Meier method. RESULTS: We included 24 patients with BMF, average age 6.5 +- 4 years, and 50% were women. 58% presented IBMF, 9 with Fanconi anemia (FA), 2 dyskeratosis congenita, 2 congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia, and 1 presented Diamond-Blackfan anemia. 12 patients treated with HSCT had a 5-year OS of 83%. ABMF represented 42%. 6 patients received IST-HSCT, 3 received IST, and 1 received HSCT. The OS of the IST-HSCT group was 86%. Six patients died, four of them related to infection. CONCLUSIONS: In this series, there was a higher number of cases with IBMF. The OS of patients treated with HSCT is similar to that reported in recent studies. The most frequent cause of death was of infectious origin which has also been previously reported. The treatment esta blished in the patients showed favorable results in a Latin American tertiary care center.",

Our study is to demonstrate that IBMFS with disease-specific characteristics requires a tailored conditioning regimens to enhance engraftment and reduce regimen related toxicities. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 42 patients diagnosed with IBMFS and transplanted with an alternative donor graft at our center from November 2012 to August 2018. Twenty-seven patients had Fanconi anemia (FA), 7 had dyskeratosis congenita (DC), and 8 had severe congenital neutropenia (SCN). Patients received ex-vivo unmanipulated alternative donor grafts from a matched unrelated donor (MUD) (n = 22), haploidentical donor (HID) (n = 17) and unrelated cord blood donor (UCBD) (n = 3). FA and DC patient subgroups received reduce intensified conditioning (RIC), while SCN patients received a myeloablative conditioning (MAC) regimen. Results: The median follow-up time for the surviving patients was 38 months (range: 9-63 months). The failure-free survival (FFS) for entire cohort was 76.1%, and was 72.4%, 100% and 56.2% for patients with FA, DC and SCN, respectively. There were no primary graft failures. The cumulative incidence of aGVHD at day 100 was 48.1%. The cumulative incidence of cGVHD at 1 and 3 years was 35.0% and 69.3%, respectively. Conclusion: HSCT using alternative donors with unmanipulated grafts and disease-specific conditioning regimens for IBMFS patients shows promising survival.",

An alternative donor was used in 119 (73%) patients, and 160 (98%) patients received a non-T-cell-depleted graft. With an 8.7-year median follow-up, 5-year overall survival (OS) was 81%. The 5-year OS was significantly higher in AA patients than in MDS and acute leukemia patients (89%, 71%, and 44%, respectively). In the MDS/leukemia group, factors associated with poor outcome in univariate analysis were older age at HSCT (>= 18 years), conditioning regimen without anti-thymocyte or lymphocyte globulin, and grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease. After 1 year, of 137 survivors, 15 developed subsequent malignancies, of whom 12 were diagnosed with head and neck (HN)/esophageal cancer. An irradiation regimen and older age were associated with the risk of HN/esophageal cancer. Five of seven deaths were attributed to subsequent malignancies more than 5 years after HSCT.

Despite restoration of long-term hematopoiesis, patients continue to remain at risk of late effects. Objectives: In our study, we aimed to reveal the problems that occur in the long-term follow-up of FA patients, and point out an ongoing need for the improvement of long-term follow-up guidelines for childhood transplant survivors with FA. Study Design: In this single centered, cross-sectional study, we analyzed the long-term outcome of 36 patients with FA according to current recommendations with a median age of 18.1 years (range: 6.1-36 years, male/female, 24/12) who underwent a HSCT at Pediatric Bone Marrow Transplantation (BMT) Unit between 1995 and 2019 and survived at least one year post-transplant. Results: The median long-term follow-up time was 8 years (range, 1-25 years). Gonadal dysfunction was detected in about 35% of our patients. 31% of the patients had hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, 4 % had hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. When the patients were evaluated for growth impairment, 7 of 12 patients who reached their final adult height and 12 of 21 patients who didn't complete their growth, had height standard deviation score below -2 SD. Three patients (9%) developed subclinical hypothyroidism, two (6%) had overt hypothyroidism and one (3%) had central hypothyroidism. Although, none of our patients fully met the criteria for metabolic syndrome, 23% of the patients had insulin resistance and 39% had dyslipidemia. Evaluation of organ dysfunctions revealed that almost 50% of the patients had obstructive and 21 % had restrictive changes in their pulmonary function tests. Hepatosteatosis was detected in 15% of the patients and mild valve dysfunction was detected in 50 % of evaluable patients. Three patients developed secondary malignancies. Squamous cell cancer developed in 2 patients and basal cell cancer in one patient. Conclusion: A risk-defined multidisciplinary approach for long-term follow up of children with FA undergoing HSCT is essential for early detection and management of late effects.",

                    "abstract": "The advent of new technologies has made it possible to identify genetic predispositions to myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute leukemias (AL) more frequently. The most frequent and best characterized at present are mutations in CEBPA, RUNX1, GATA2, ETV6 and DDX41 and, either in the presence of one of these mutations with a high allelic frequency, or in the case of a personal or family history suggestive of blood abnormalities such as non-immune thrombocytopenia, it is recommended to look for the possibility of a hereditary hematological malignancy (HHM). Indeed, early recognition of these HHMs allows better adaptation of the management of patients and their relatives, as allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is very often proposed for these pathologies. According to current data, with the exception of the GATA2 mutation, the constitutional or somatic nature of the mutations does not seem to influence the prognosis of hematological diseases. Therefore, the indication for an allograft will be determined according to the usual criteria. However, when searching for a family donor, it is important to ensure that there is no hereditary disease in the donor. In order to guarantee the possibility of performing the HSC allograft within a short period of time, it may be necessary to initiate a parallel procedure to find an unrelated donor. Given the limited information on the modalities of HSC transplantation in this setting, it is important to assess the benefit/risk of the disease and the procedure to decide on the type of conditioning (myeloablative or reduced intensity). In view of the limited experience with the risk of secondary cancers in the medium and long-term, it may be appropriate to recommend reduced intensity conditioning, as in the case of better characterized syndromic hematological diseases such as Fanconi anemia or telomere diseases. In summary, it seems important to evoke HHM more frequently, particularly in the presence of a family history, certain mutations or persistent blood abnormalities, in order to discuss the specific modalities of HSC allografting, particularly with regard to the search for a donor and the evaluation of certain modalities of the procedure, such as conditioning. It should be noted that the discovery of HHM, especially if the indication of an allogeneic HSC transplant is retained, will raise ethical and psychological considerations not only for the patient, but also for his family. A multidisciplinary approach involving molecular biologists, geneticists, hematologists and psychologists is essential.",

                    "abstract": "High-dose chemotherapy with melphalan followed by autologous transplantation is a first-line treatment for multiple myeloma. Here, we present preclinical evidence that this treatment may be significantly improved by the addition of exportin 1 inhibitors (XPO1i). The XPO1i selinexor, eltanexor, and KOS-2464 sensitized human multiple myeloma cells to melphalan. Human 8226 and U266 multiple myeloma cell lines and melphalan-resistant cell lines (8226-LR5 and U266-LR6) were highly sensitized to melphalan by XPO1i. Multiple myeloma cells from newly diagnosed and relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients were also sensitized by XPO1i to melphalan. In NOD/SCIDgamma mice challenged with either parental 8226 or U266 multiple myeloma and melphalan-resistant multiple myeloma tumors, XPO1i/melphalan combination treatments demonstrated stronger synergistic antitumor effects than single-agent melphalan with minimal toxicity. Synergistic cell death resulted from increased XPO1i/melphalan-induced DNA damage in a dose-dependent manner and decreased DNA repair. In addition, repair of melphalan-induced DNA damage was inhibited by selinexor, which decreased melphalan-induced monoubiquitination of FANCD2 in multiple myeloma cells. Knockdown of FANCD2 was found to replicate the effect of selinexor when used with melphalan, increasing DNA damage (gammaH2AX) by inhibiting DNA repair. Thus, combination therapies that include selinexor or eltanexor with melphalan may have the potential to improve treatment outcomes of multiple myeloma in melphalan-resistant and newly diagnosed patients. The combination of selinexor and melphalan is currently being investigated in the context of high-dose chemotherapy and autologous transplant (NCT02780609). SIGNIFICANCE: Inhibition of exportin 1 with selinexor synergistically sensitizes human multiple myeloma to melphalan by inhibiting Fanconi anemia pathway-mediated DNA repair.",

Oral leukoplakia (OL) is frequent in FA patients and lacks a defined treatment. High-power diode lasers (HPDL) offer precise, minimally invasive ablation with favorable healing. This paper reports HPDL use in OL management in FA patients. CASE REPORT: Four FA patients (1742 years) with clinically and histologically confirmed OL underwent HPDL ablation (808 nm, 1.52 W). Lesions were removed with a 0.5 mm safety margin. All cases showed good healing, no recurrences within 1218 months, and minimal discomfort. Two lesions had dysplasia; one patient had prior SCC. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: HPDL showed favorable short-term outcomes for OL in FA patients. Though limited by small sample and follow-up, the approach may delay malignant transformation. Further studies are needed to confirm long-term benefits.",

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to explore the mechanism by which HBO treats spinal cord injury (SCI) at the level of lncRNAs. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Immense amounts of research have established that HBO treatment promotes the recovery of neurological function after SCI. The mechanism of action remains to be clarified. METHODS: High-throughput RNA sequencing, Gene Ontology, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis were used to profile lncRNA expression and analyze biological function in the spinal cords of mice from sham-operated, SCI, and HBO-treated groups. The differential expression of lncRNA between the groups was assessed using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Differential expression across 577 lncRNAs was identified among the three groups. GO analysis showed that free ubiquitin chain polymerization, ubiquitin homeostasis, DNA replication, synthesis of RNA primer, single-stranded telomeric DNA binding, and alpha-amylase activity were significantly enriched. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis displayed that vitamin B6 metabolism, one carbon pool by folate, DNA replication, lysine degradation, beta-alanine metabolism, fanconi anemia pathway, and Notch signal pathway were the main pathways with enrichment significance. LncRNAs NONMMUT 092674.1, NONMMUT042986.2, and NONMMUT018850.2 showed significantly different expression between the SCI and the other two groups (P<0.05, <0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to determine the expression profiles of lncRNAs in the injured spinal cord after HBO treatment. We identified several important dysregulated lncRNAs in this setting. These results help us better understand the mechanism by which HBO treats SCI and provide new potential therapeutic targets for SCI.",

Calcineurin inhibitors are medications commonly used for long periods in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) and solid organ transplantation. Medication-related fibrovascular hyperplasia (MRFH) is an extra gingival hyperplastic nodular growth associated with medications use. This study reports five cases of pediatric patients (6 to 12-years-old) diagnosed with Fanconi anemia (FA) after HSCT who presented similar oral mucosal lesions associated with the use of cyclosporine, phenobarbital and amlodipine. After excision of the lesions, histopathological analysis described them as pyogenic granuloma (PG). As the aetiology of the lesions manifested by the patients was associated with the use of medications, the final diagnosis was MRFH. Despite the clinical and histopathological similarity between PG and MRFH, it is fundamental to know the aetiological agent for achieving definitive diagnosis and correct management. Considering the etiologic agent (medication) and histopathological findings, it is suggested that the most appropriate term for this manifestation should be \"medication-related fibrovascular hyperplasia\". The correct nomenclature related to extra gingival hyperplastic lesions identified in patients on medications with potential to induce hyperplastic reactions should be adopted to facilitate scientific communication and improve the treatment.",

In 1988, Gluckman et al. reported the first successful matched sibling cord blood transplant (CBT) in a child with Fanconi Anemia. In 1991, Rubinstein et al. established an unrelated donor CB bank, and in 1993, the first unrelated CBT used a unit from this bank. Since that time, >40 000 CBTs have been performed worldwide. Early outcomes of CBT were mixed and demonstrated the importance of cell dose from the CB donor. We hypothesized that improvements in CB banking and transplantation favorably impacted outcomes of CBT today and performed a retrospective study combining data from Eurocord and Duke University in 4834 children transplanted with a single unrelated CB unit (CBU) from 1993 to 2019. Changes in standard transplant outcomes (overall survival [OS], disease free survival [DFS], acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease [GvHD], treatment related mortality [TRM], and relapse) over 3 time periods (1: <2005; 2: 2005 to <2010; and 3: >2010 to 2019) were studied. Increased cell dose and degree of HLA matching were observed over time. OS, times to engraftment, and DFS improved over time. The incidence of TRM and GvHD decreased while the incidence of relapse remained unchanged. Relative contributions of cell dose and HLA matching to transplant outcomes were also assessed and showed that HLA matching was more important than cell dose in this pediatric cohort.",

The available management strategies for these disorders are still unsatisfactory and do not eliminate the main causes. As genetic aberrations are the main causes of all forms of hereditary anemia, the optimal approach involves repairing the defective gene, possibly through the transplantation of normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from a normal matching donor or through gene therapy approaches (either in vivo or ex vivo) to correct the patient's HSCs. To clearly illustrate the importance of cell and gene therapy in hereditary anemia, this paper provides a review of the genetic aberration, epidemiology, clinical features, current management, and cell and gene therapy endeavors related to SCD, thalassemia, Fanconi anemia, and G6PDD. Moreover, we expound the future research direction of HSC derivation from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), strategies to edit HSCs, gene therapy risk mitigation, and their clinical perspectives. In conclusion, gene-corrected hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has promising outcomes for SCD, Fanconi anemia, and thalassemia, and it may overcome the limitation of the source of allogenic bone marrow transplantation.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: The DNA damage immune response (DDIR) assay was developed in breast cancer based on biology associated with deficiencies in homologous recombination and Fanconi anemia pathways. A positive DDIR call identifies patients likely to respond to platinum-based chemotherapies in breast and esophageal cancers. In colorectal cancer, there is currently no biomarker to predict response to oxaliplatin. We tested the ability of the DDIR assay to predict response to oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in colorectal cancer and characterized the biology in DDIR-positive colorectal cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Samples and clinical data were assessed according to DDIR status from patients who received either 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or 5FUFA (bolus and infusion 5-FU with folinic acid) plus oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) within the FOCUS trial (n = 361, stage IV), or neoadjuvant FOLFOX in the FOxTROT trial (n = 97, stage II/III). Whole transcriptome, mutation, and IHC data of these samples were used to interrogate the biology of DDIR in colorectal cancer. RESULTS: Contrary to our hypothesis, DDIR-negative patients displayed a trend toward improved outcome for oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy compared with DDIR-positive patients. DDIR positivity was associated with microsatellite instability (MSI) and colorectal molecular subtype 1. Refinement of the DDIR signature, based on overlapping IFN-related chemokine signaling associated with DDIR positivity across colorectal cancer and breast cancer cohorts, further confirmed that the DDIR assay did not have predictive value for oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in colorectal cancer. CONCLUSIONS: DDIR positivity does not predict improved response following oxaliplatin treatment in colorectal cancer. However, data presented here suggest the potential of the DDIR assay in identifying immune-rich tumors that may benefit from immune checkpoint blockade, beyond current use of MSI status.",

                    "abstract": "Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a curative treatment for patients with many different blood and immune diseases; however, current treatment regimens contain non-specific chemotherapy and/or irradiation conditioning, which carry both short-term and long-term toxicities. The use of such agents may be particularly harmful for patients with Fanconi anemia (FA), who have genetic mutations resulting in deficiencies in DNA repair, leading to increased sensitivity to genotoxic agents. mAb-based conditioning has been proposed as an alternative conditioning strategy for HSCT that minimizes these toxicities by eliminating collateral tissue damage. Given the high need for improved treatments for FA patients, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of different alphaCD117 mAb agents and immunosuppression on hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) depletion and explored their ability to safely establish therapeutic donor hematopoiesis post-HSCT in FA disease models. We evaluated the effects of different concentrations of alphaCD117 mAbs in vitro and in vivo on HSC growth and depletion. To further assess the efficacy of mAb-based conditioning, Fancd2-/- animals were treated with alphaCD117 mAb and combination agents with alphaCD47 mAb and antibody-drug-conjugates (ADCs) for syngeneic HSCT. Immunosuppression alphaCD4 mAb was added to all in vivo experiments due to a slightly mismatched background between the donor grafts and recipients. Immunosuppressant cocktails were also given to Fancd2-/- animals to evaluate the efficacy of mAb-based conditioning in the haploidentical setting. Statistical analyses were done using the unpaired t-test. We found that antagonistic alphaCD117 mAbs alone do not deplete host HSCs or enhance HSCT effectively in FA mouse models; however, the potency of alphaCD117 mAbs can be safely augmented through combination with alphaCD47 mAbs and with ADCs, both of which lead to profound HSC depletion and establishment of long-term donor engraftment post-syngeneic HSCT. This is the first time these approaches have been tested in parallel in any disease setting, with the greatest donor engraftment observed after CD117-ADC conditioning. Interestingly, our data also suggest that HSC-targeted conditioning is not necessary in HSCT for FA, as high donor HSC engraftment was observed with mAb-based immune suppression alone with immunologically matched and mismatched haploidentical grafts. These results demonstrate the safety and efficacy of several different non-genotoxic mAb-based conditioning strategies in the FA setting. In addition, they show that if sufficient immunosuppression is given to obtain initial donor HSC engraftment, turnover of a majority of the hematolymphoid system can result, likely owing to the survival advantage of wild-type HSCs over FA HSCs. Such non-toxic all-mAb-based conditioning strategies could be transformative for FA patients and those with other hematolymphoid diseases.",

                    "abstract": "The study aimed to investigate the fanconi anemia (FA)-related and stemness-related genes in lung cancer (LC) patients. Firstly, we identified stemness-related genes through weighted gene co-expression network analysis combined with TCGA database. Further combined stemness-related genes with FA-related genes to screen for prognostic-related genes. Risk score was constructed from the screened genes and comprehensive bioinformatics analyses were performed. Finally, single-cell data and in vitro experiment were used to validate our results. We screened a total of eight genes to construct a risk score. The risk score was an independent prognostic factor for LC. The validation results of multiple GEO databases were consistent with our results. Functional and pathway enrichment analysis showed that risk score was associated with cell cycle, DNA replication, DNA damage repair, and immune-related pathways. The results showed to be related to the stem cell self-renewal and proliferation. Besides, we also found that patients with higher risk scores had lower immune activity and function, and the effectiveness of immunotherapy might be poorer, with a higher rate of immune escape. Finally, our results revealed that SLC2A1 had the highest correlation with B cells in single-cell data analysis, and we validated its correlation with B cells and its expression with FA-related genes, tumor invasiveness, stemness, and drug sensitivity. Our research constructed a risk score based on FA-related and tumor stemness-related specific genes. In addition to accurately predicting the prognosis of patients with LC, the risk score may also serve as an innovative and viable predictor of immunotherapy response.",

The aim of our study is to evaluate the impact and benefits of allogenic matched donor HSCT in a case of a 12 year-old girl with FA, who displayed good clinical evolution following 2 months post-transplantation. METHODS: In the pre-transplant phase, reference blood samples from the donor and recipient were collected on EDTA. The DNA from blood samples was extracted using an automated Maxwell  48 RSC instrument (Promega, USA) with the Maxwell  RSC Whole blood DNA kit (Promega, USA). For DNA quantification, the PowerQuant System kit (Promega, USA) was used with the ABI 7500 Real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, USA). The amplification of the short tandem repeat markers was performed using the 24plex Investigator QS kit (Qiagen, Germany) on a ProFlex PCR System. Furthermore, the PCR products were separated and detected on an ABI 3500 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosytems, USA). RESULTS: Thirty days post transplantation, a complete chimerism (CC) was achieved with a full replacement by do-nor derived hematopoietic cells. Sixty days post transplantation, the CC status was maintained with improvement of hematological findings. CONCLUSIONS: In FA, chimerism monitoring after HSCT provides useful information regarding engraftment or possibility of post-transplantation complications such as graft versus host disease.",

In 1988, Gluckman et al. reported the first successful matched sibling cord blood transplant (CBT) in a child with Fanconi Anemia. In 1991, Rubinstein et al. established an unrelated donor CB bank, and in 1993, the first unrelated CBT used a unit from this bank. Since that time, >40 000 CBTs have been performed worldwide. Early outcomes of CBT were mixed and demonstrated the importance of cell dose from the CB donor. We hypothesized that improvements in CB banking and transplantation favorably impacted outcomes of CBT today and performed a retrospective study combining data from Eurocord and Duke University in 4834 children transplanted with a single unrelated CB unit (CBU) from 1993 to 2019. Changes in standard transplant outcomes (overall survival [OS], disease free survival [DFS], acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease [GvHD], treatment related mortality [TRM], and relapse) over 3 time periods (1: <2005; 2: 2005 to <2010; and 3: >2010 to 2019) were studied. Increased cell dose and degree of HLA matching were observed over time. OS, times to engraftment, and DFS improved over time. The incidence of TRM and GvHD decreased while the incidence of relapse remained unchanged. Relative contributions of cell dose and HLA matching to transplant outcomes were also assessed and showed that HLA matching was more important than cell dose in this pediatric cohort.",

This retrospective study, conducted on behalf of the EBMT SAAWP and PDWP, aims to report the current outcomes of haplo-SCT in I-BMFs, comparing the different in vivo and ex vivo T-cell depletion approaches. One hundred and sixty-two I-BMF patients who underwent haplo-SCT (median age 7.4 years) have been registered. Fanconi Anemia was the most represented diagnosis (70.1%). Based on different T-cell depletion (TCD) approaches, four categories were identified: (1) TCRalphabeta+ /CD19+ -depletion (43.8%); (2) T-repleted with post-transplant Cyclophosphamide (PTCy, 34.0%); (3) In-vivo T-depletion with ATG/alemtuzumab (14.8%); (4) CD34+ positive selection (7.4%). The cumulative incidences (CI) of neutrophil and platelet engraftment were 84% and 76% respectively, while that of primary and secondary graft failure was 10% and 8% respectively. The 100-day CI of acute GvHD grade III-IV(95% CI) was 13%, while the 24-month CI of extensive chronic GvHD was 4%. After a median follow-up of 43.4 months, the 2-year overall survival(OS) and GvHD/Rejection-free Survival (GRFS) probabilities are 67% and 53%, respectively. The TCR CD3+ alphabeta+ /CD19+ depletion group showed a significantly lower incidence of both acute and chronic GvHD and higher OS (79%; p0.013) and GRFS (71%; p < .001), while no significant differences in outcomes have been observed by different diagnosis and conditioning regimens. This large retrospective study supports the safety and feasibility of haplo-SCT in I-BMF patients. TCRalphabeta+ /CD19+ depletion offers higher chances of patients' survival, with a significantly lower risk of severe a- and c-GvHD in I-BMFs compared to other platforms.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Fanconi anemia (FA) is an inherited disorder characterized clinically by congenital abnormalities, progressive bone marrow failure (BMF), and a predisposition to malignancy. Gene therapy (GT) of FA, via the infusion of gene-corrected peripheral blood (PB) autologous hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), may constitute a cure for BMF. GT bypasses the donor restrictions and adverse events associated with allogenic HSC transplantation. However, adequate harvesting of PB-HSCs is a crucial determinant of successful engraftment in gene therapy. Harvesting the low numbers of HSCs in patients with FA is particularly challenging. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This open-label phase I/II trial evaluates the feasibility and safety of co-administration of G-CSF and plerixafor in patients with FA for the mobilization and harvesting of peripheral HSCs, intending to use them in a gene therapy trial. Patients with mutations in the FANCA gene received two subcutaneous injections of G-CSF (6 mug/kg x 2/d from D1 to D8. Plerixafor (0.24 mg/kg/d) was administered 2 h before apheresis (from D5 onward). RESULTS: CD34+ cells were mobilized for four patients quickly but transiently after the plerixafor injection. One patient had a CD34+ cell count of over 100/mul; the mobilization peaked 2 h after the injection and lasted for more than 9 h. There were no short-term adverse events associated with the mobilization or harvesting procedures. CONCLUSION: Our data in patients with FA show that the mobilization of HSCs with G-CSF and plerixafor is safe and more efficient in younger individuals without BMF.",

                    "abstract": "High-dose chemotherapy with melphalan followed by autologous transplantation is a first-line treatment for multiple myeloma. Here, we present preclinical evidence that this treatment may be significantly improved by the addition of exportin 1 inhibitors (XPO1i). The XPO1i selinexor, eltanexor, and KOS-2464 sensitized human multiple myeloma cells to melphalan. Human 8226 and U266 multiple myeloma cell lines and melphalan-resistant cell lines (8226-LR5 and U266-LR6) were highly sensitized to melphalan by XPO1i. Multiple myeloma cells from newly diagnosed and relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients were also sensitized by XPO1i to melphalan. In NOD/SCIDgamma mice challenged with either parental 8226 or U266 multiple myeloma and melphalan-resistant multiple myeloma tumors, XPO1i/melphalan combination treatments demonstrated stronger synergistic antitumor effects than single-agent melphalan with minimal toxicity. Synergistic cell death resulted from increased XPO1i/melphalan-induced DNA damage in a dose-dependent manner and decreased DNA repair. In addition, repair of melphalan-induced DNA damage was inhibited by selinexor, which decreased melphalan-induced monoubiquitination of FANCD2 in multiple myeloma cells. Knockdown of FANCD2 was found to replicate the effect of selinexor when used with melphalan, increasing DNA damage (gammaH2AX) by inhibiting DNA repair. Thus, combination therapies that include selinexor or eltanexor with melphalan may have the potential to improve treatment outcomes of multiple myeloma in melphalan-resistant and newly diagnosed patients. The combination of selinexor and melphalan is currently being investigated in the context of high-dose chemotherapy and autologous transplant (NCT02780609). SIGNIFICANCE: Inhibition of exportin 1 with selinexor synergistically sensitizes human multiple myeloma to melphalan by inhibiting Fanconi anemia pathway-mediated DNA repair.",

                    "abstract": "The advent of new technologies has made it possible to identify genetic predispositions to myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute leukemias (AL) more frequently. The most frequent and best characterized at present are mutations in CEBPA, RUNX1, GATA2, ETV6 and DDX41 and, either in the presence of one of these mutations with a high allelic frequency, or in the case of a personal or family history suggestive of blood abnormalities such as non-immune thrombocytopenia, it is recommended to look for the possibility of a hereditary hematological malignancy (HHM). Indeed, early recognition of these HHMs allows better adaptation of the management of patients and their relatives, as allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is very often proposed for these pathologies. According to current data, with the exception of the GATA2 mutation, the constitutional or somatic nature of the mutations does not seem to influence the prognosis of hematological diseases. Therefore, the indication for an allograft will be determined according to the usual criteria. However, when searching for a family donor, it is important to ensure that there is no hereditary disease in the donor. In order to guarantee the possibility of performing the HSC allograft within a short period of time, it may be necessary to initiate a parallel procedure to find an unrelated donor. Given the limited information on the modalities of HSC transplantation in this setting, it is important to assess the benefit/risk of the disease and the procedure to decide on the type of conditioning (myeloablative or reduced intensity). In view of the limited experience with the risk of secondary cancers in the medium and long-term, it may be appropriate to recommend reduced intensity conditioning, as in the case of better characterized syndromic hematological diseases such as Fanconi anemia or telomere diseases. In summary, it seems important to evoke HHM more frequently, particularly in the presence of a family history, certain mutations or persistent blood abnormalities, in order to discuss the specific modalities of HSC allografting, particularly with regard to the search for a donor and the evaluation of certain modalities of the procedure, such as conditioning. It should be noted that the discovery of HHM, especially if the indication of an allogeneic HSC transplant is retained, will raise ethical and psychological considerations not only for the patient, but also for his family. A multidisciplinary approach involving molecular biologists, geneticists, hematologists and psychologists is essential.",

We report the case of a patient with advanced gastric cancer, Fanconi anemia (FA), and primary biliary cholangitis. A 26-year-old woman visited a local physician complaining of epigastralgia. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed edematous changes with poor distension and circumferential thickened folds with erosions in the gastric body. Biopsy results of the lesion specimens revealed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed gastric wall with irregular thickness, several nodules in the peritoneal cavity, and a mass lesion in the right ovary. We diagnosed the patient with T4N2M1 stage IV gastric cancer accompanied by peritoneal and ovarian metastases and initiated nivolumab with S-1 plus oxaliplatin as the first-line treatment regimen. Because of immune-related adverse events after one course of systemic treatment, the regimen was changed to ramucirumab combined with nab-paclitaxel chemotherapy as the second-line treatment. After three cycles of weekly nab-paclitaxel with ramucirumab, the decreased platelet count did not recover, and her general condition gradually deteriorated. Comprehensive genome profiling using next-generation sequencing was performed to determine the feasibility of genotype-matched therapies. Alterations in FA complementation group A (FANCA) F1263del (49.1%) and E484Q (12.3%), which encode a key component of the multiprotein FA complex, were identified. The patient died 10 months after treatment initiation. In conclusion, when treating malignancies in adolescent and young adult patients, the genomic background should be considered.",

PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors upregulate T-cell killing of cancer cells and is a class of promising treatment for FA-AML. Here, we developed a novel FA-AML murine model that allows the study of human AML with a humanized immune system in order to investigate immunotherapeutic treatments in vivo. FA-AML1 cells and non-FA-mutated Kasumi-1 cells were injected into 8-10 week old NSG mice. Once leukemic engraftment was confirmed by HLA-DR expression in the peripheral blood, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMCs) were injected into the mice. One week post-hPBMCs injection, Nivolumab (PD-1 inhibitor) or PBS vehicle control was administered to the mice bi-weekly. In our Nivolumab treated mice, FA-AML1, but not Kasumi-1-engrafted mice, had significantly prolonged overall survival. Both FA-AML1 and Kasumi-1 engrafted mice had decreased spleen weights. Higher leukemic infiltration into vital organs was observed in FA-AML1 engrafted mice compared to Kasumi-1 engrafted mice. In conclusion, our novel humanized murine model of FA-mutated AML is an attractive tool for supporting further studies and clinical trials using PD-1 inhibitors to treat FA-mutated AML.",

An alternative donor was used in 119 (73%) patients, and 160 (98%) patients received a non-T-cell-depleted graft. With an 8.7-year median follow-up, 5-year overall survival (OS) was 81%. The 5-year OS was significantly higher in AA patients than in MDS and acute leukemia patients (89%, 71%, and 44%, respectively). In the MDS/leukemia group, factors associated with poor outcome in univariate analysis were older age at HSCT (>= 18 years), conditioning regimen without anti-thymocyte or lymphocyte globulin, and grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease. After 1 year, of 137 survivors, 15 developed subsequent malignancies, of whom 12 were diagnosed with head and neck (HN)/esophageal cancer. An irradiation regimen and older age were associated with the risk of HN/esophageal cancer. Five of seven deaths were attributed to subsequent malignancies more than 5 years after HSCT. On the basis of the risk factors for HSCT in MDS/leukemia patients and subsequent malignancies, a more effective HSCT approach is required.",

Renal biopsy is the gold-standard examination for defining multiple etiologies of kidney impairment. Although kidney injury following HSCT has been studied, little is known about the effects of allo-HSCT on renal pathology in pediatric patients. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed renal biopsy specimens from children with kidney injury after allo-HSCT and correlated results with clinical data in the last 10 years. RESULTS: Among 25 children (18 males and 7 females), three patients had proteinuria indicating nephrotic syndrome (24-hour urinary total protein/weight > 50 mg/kg/d), nine patients had severely reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m2) and four patients received kidney replacement therapy (KRT).

                    "abstract": "STUDY DESIGN: A functional, transcriptome, and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) expression analysis in the spinal cord of mice after hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) treatment. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to explore the mechanism by which HBO treats spinal cord injury (SCI) at the level of lncRNAs. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Immense amounts of research have established that HBO treatment promotes the recovery of neurological function after SCI. The mechanism of action remains to be clarified. METHODS: High-throughput RNA sequencing, Gene Ontology, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis were used to profile lncRNA expression and analyze biological function in the spinal cords of mice from sham-operated, SCI, and HBO-treated groups. The differential expression of lncRNA between the groups was assessed using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Differential expression across 577 lncRNAs was identified among the three groups. GO analysis showed that free ubiquitin chain polymerization, ubiquitin homeostasis, DNA replication, synthesis of RNA primer, single-stranded telomeric DNA binding, and alpha-amylase activity were significantly enriched. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis displayed that vitamin B6 metabolism, one carbon pool by folate, DNA replication, lysine degradation, beta-alanine metabolism, fanconi anemia pathway, and Notch signal pathway were the main pathways with enrichment significance. LncRNAs NONMMUT 092674.1, NONMMUT042986.2, and NONMMUT018850.2 showed significantly different expression between the SCI and the other two groups (P<0.05, <0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to determine the expression profiles of lncRNAs in the injured spinal cord after HBO treatment. We identified several important dysregulated lncRNAs in this setting. These results help us better understand the mechanism by which HBO treats SCI and provide new potential therapeutic targets for SCI.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) remains the only available curative treatment for Fanconi Anemia (FA), with particularly favorable outcomes reported after matched sibling donor (MSD) transplant. OBJECTIVES: To describe outcomes, with a special focus on late complications, in FA patients who underwent umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT). STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of allogeneic UCBT for FA performed between 1988 and 2021 in European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) affiliated centers. RESULTS: A total of 205 FA patients underwent UCBT (55 related and 150 unrelated) across 77 transplant centers. Indications for UCBT were bone marrow failure in 190 patients and acute leukemia/myelodysplasia in 15 patients. Median age at transplant was 9 (1.2-43) years, with only 20 patients over the age of 18. Among the donor-recipient pairs, 56% (n=116) had 0-1/6 HLA mismatch. Limited field radiotherapy was administered to 28% (n=58) and 78% (n=160) received a Fludarabine (FLU)-based conditioning regimen. Serotherapy consisted of anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG, n=159; 78%) or alemtuzumab (n=12; 6%). Median follow-up was 10 years for related and 7 years for unrelated UCBT. Excellent outcomes were observed in the setting of related UCBT, including a 60-day cumulative incidence (CI) of neutrophil recovery at 98.1% (93.9-100), a 100-day CI of grades II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) at 17.3% (9.5-31.6), and a 5-year CI of chronic GVHD at 22.7% (13.3-38.7; 13% extensive). Five-year overall survival (OS) was 88%. In multivariate analysis, none of the factors included in the model predicted a better OS. In unrelated UCBT, the 60-day CI of neutrophil recovery was 78.7% (71.9-86.3), the 100-day CI of grade II-IV aGVHD was 31.4% (24.6-40.2) and the 5-year CI of cGVHD was 24.3% (17.8-32.2) (12% extensive). Five-year OS was 44%. In multivariate analysis, negative recipient CMV serology, FLU-based conditioning, age at UCBT less than 9 years and 0-1/6 HLA mismatch were associated with improved OS. A total of 106 patients, including 5 AL/MDS, survived for over 2 years after UCBT. Nine of these patients developed subsequent neoplasms (SN), including one donor-derived AML and 8 solid tumors, at a median of 9.7 (2.3-21.8) years post-UCBT (one related and 8 unrelated UCBT). In a subset of 49 patients with available data, late non-malignant complications affecting various organ systems were observed at a median of 8.7 (2.7-28.8) years post-UCBT. CONCLUSION: UCB is a valid source of stem cells for transplantation in patients with FA, with best results observed after related UCBT. After unrelated UCBT, improved survival was observed in patients transplanted at a younger age, with FLU-based conditioning and better HLA parity. The incidence of organ specific complications and subsequent neoplasms was relatively low. Subsequent neoplasm incidence, mostly squamous cell carcinoma, increases with time. Rigorous follow-up and life-long screening is crucial in Fanconi anemia patients transplant survivors. The long-term complications observed emphasize the need for long-life screening of transplant survivors.",

While several nontransplant treatments are currently under evaluation, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains the only therapeutic option for bone marrow failure (BMF). Although HSCT outcomes in patients with FA have remarkably improved over the past 20 years, in addition to the mortality intrinsic to the procedure, HSCT increases the risk and accelerates the appearance of late malignancies. HSCT offers the best outcome when performed in optimal conditions (moderate cytopenia shifting to severe, prior to transfusion dependence and before clonal evolution or myelodysplasia/acute myeloid leukemia); hence, an accurate surveillance program is vital. Haploidentical HSCT offers very good outcomes, although long-term effects on malignancies have not been fully explored. A monitoring plan is also important to identify cancers, particularly head and neck carcinomas, in very early phases. Gene therapy is still experimental and offers the most encouraging results when performed in early phases of BMF by infusing high numbers of corrected cells without genotoxic effects. Patients with FA need comprehensive monitoring and care plans, coordinated by centers with expertise in FA management, that start at diagnosis and continue throughout life. Such long-term follow-up is essential to detect complications related to the disease or treatment in this setting.",

                    "abstract": "Inherited bone marrow failure syndromes (IBMFSs) are a group of rare genetic disorders characterized by bone marrow failure with unique phenotypes and predisposition to cancer. Classical IBMFSs primarily include Fanconi anemia with impaired DNA damage repair, dyskeratosis congenita with telomere maintenance dysfunction, and Diamond-Blackfan anemia with aberrant ribosomal protein biosynthesis. Recently, comprehensive genetic analyses have been implemented for the definitive diagnosis of classic IBMFSs, and advances in molecular genetics have led to the identification of novel disorders such as AMeD and MIRAGE syndromes. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), a promising option to overcome impaired hematopoiesis in patients with IBMFSs, does not correct nonhematological defects and may enhance the risk of secondary malignancies. Disease-specific management is necessary because IBMFSs differ in underlying defects and are associated with varying degrees of risk for clonal evolution and early or late complications after HCT. In addition, long-term follow-up is essential to detect complications related to the IBMFS or HCT. This review provides a summary of current clinical practices along with the latest data on HCT in IBMFSs.",

Despite restoration of long-term hematopoiesis, patients continue to remain at risk of late effects. Objectives: In our study, we aimed to reveal the problems that occur in the long-term follow-up of FA patients, and point out an ongoing need for the improvement of long-term follow-up guidelines for childhood transplant survivors with FA. Study Design: In this single centered, cross-sectional study, we analyzed the long-term outcome of 36 patients with FA according to current recommendations with a median age of 18.1 years (range: 6.1-36 years, male/female, 24/12) who underwent a HSCT at Pediatric Bone Marrow Transplantation (BMT) Unit between 1995 and 2019 and survived at least one year post-transplant. Results: The median long-term follow-up time was 8 years (range, 1-25 years). Gonadal dysfunction was detected in about 35% of our patients. 31% of the patients had hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, 4 % had hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. When the patients were evaluated for growth impairment, 7 of 12 patients who reached their final adult height and 12 of 21 patients who didn't complete their growth, had height standard deviation score below -2 SD. Three patients (9%) developed subclinical hypothyroidism, two (6%) had overt hypothyroidism and one (3%) had central hypothyroidism. Although, none of our patients fully met the criteria for metabolic syndrome, 23% of the patients had insulin resistance and 39% had dyslipidemia. Evaluation of organ dysfunctions revealed that almost 50% of the patients had obstructive and 21 % had restrictive changes in their pulmonary function tests. Hepatosteatosis was detected in 15% of the patients and mild valve dysfunction was detected in 50 % of evaluable patients. Three patients developed secondary malignancies. Squamous cell cancer developed in 2 patients and basal cell cancer in one patient. Conclusion: A risk-defined multidisciplinary approach for long-term follow up of children with FA undergoing HSCT is essential for early detection and management of late effects.",

Thus, management of this multisystem disorder has previously been unfamiliar to many hematologists specializing in the care of adolescents and young adults (AYA). The increased diagnosis of FA in AYA patients, facilitated by widely available germline genomic testing, improved long-term survival of children with FA following matched sibling and alternative donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) performed for BMF, and expanding need in the near future for long-term monitoring in patients achieving hematologic stabilization following ex vivo gene therapy are all reasons why management of FA in AYA populations deserves specific consideration. In this review, we address the unique challenges and evidence-based practice recommendations for the management of AYA patients with FA. Specific topics addressed include hematologic monitoring in AYA patients yet to undergo HSCT, management of myeloid malignancies occurring in FA, diagnosis and management of nonhematologic malignances and organ dysfunction in AYA patients with FA, and evolving considerations for the long-term monitoring of patients with FA undergoing gene therapy.",

                    "abstract": "Fanconi anemia is the most common inherited bone marrow failure syndrome, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative option. Post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) is challenging in this group of children, given their increased sensitivity to chemotherapy. We performed a retrospective analysis of the data on children diagnosed with Fanconi anemia who underwent a haploidentical HSCT with PTCy from January 2014 to December 2019. Nineteen children (male/female, 0.75:1) underwent 21 haplo-HSCTs with PTCy. Fludarabine, low-dose cyclophosphamide, and 200 centi-gray total body irradiation were included in the conditioning regimen with 25 mg/kg PTCy on days +3 and +4. Haplo-graft was from a sibling in 38% and father in 57% of transplants. The source of stem cells was peripheral blood stem cells in 81% and bone marrow in 19% of transplants, with a median CD34 dose of 5.0 x 106/kg. We documented engraftment in 84% and primary graft failure in 10% of transplants. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) was infused concomitantly during cyclophosphamide in 13 children. Grade 2 and 3 mucositis was lower among those who received NAC as compared to those who did not (30% and 15% versus 33% and 50%), while transaminitis was higher among those who did not receive the infusion. The incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was 68%, and 81% of these were steroid responsive (grade I/II). We documented chronic GVHD in 25% children, predominantly involving the skin and mouth, which responded to low-dose steroids and ruxolitinib. Serum ferritin was monitored twice weekly as a surrogate marker for cytokine release syndrome due to nonavailability of IL-6 levels. A 1- or 2-log increase in the titers of ferritin associated with clinical features guided the early addition of steroids in the periengraftment period. The mean survival was found to be less among those with high serum ferritin (>10,000 ng/dL) in the periengraftment period as compared to those with ferritin <10,000 ng/dL (mean survival of 25 +- 10 months versus 50 +- 6 months, respectively). The overall survival in our cohort was 68.4%, with a mean survival time of 41.5 months (95% confidence interval, 29.3 to 53.8 months), with a statistically significant correlation between inferior outcome and having received over 15 transfusions before HSCT (P = .01). PTCy can be considered a viable option in children with Fanconi anemia, particularly in resource-limited settings given the high costs of HSCTs. Focused interventions in this subset of children help improve survival outcomes. Early identification of cytokine release syndrome and risk-adapted steroid therapy during engraftment helps prevent mortality. The concomitant use of NAC during cyclophosphamide infusion helps reduce oxygen free radical related tissue damage and regimen-related toxicity.",

                    "abstract": "Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is one of the most common neurologic complications following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). We aimed to evaluate the incidence, clinical, and imaging features of PRES in pediatric patients with Fanconi anemia (FA) following HSCT. This prospective study included all post-HSCT patients with underlying FA disease between 2014 and 2017. Brain computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed in all individuals who developed neurologic symptoms. PRES was diagnosed based on clinic-radiological evidence. Follow-up MRI was performed in all patients with PRES within two months. Forty-one patients with FA (28 males; mean age, 8.19 +- 3.25 years) were enrolled. Out of 15 patients with acute neurologic symptoms, PRES was diagnosed in 9 individuals (21.95% of the total cohort). The occurrence of PRES was significantly higher in patients who had a donor with a 1-locus mismatch (P= .02). Donor relation, stem cell source, and graft-versus-host disease grade did not have any significant association with the development of PRES. MRI showed asymmetric vasogenic edema in 5 patients, an overt infarct in 1 patient, and foci of microhemorrhages in 3 patients, 1 of whom developed a hemorrhagic infarct. This patient died shortly, and persistent microhemorrhages were noted in the other 2 patients. Our findings demonstrate a greater risk of developing PRES after HSCT in patients with FA compared with those with other diseases (21.95% versus 1% to 10%), and in contrast to its term, it might be irreversible and has adverse effects on HSCT outcomes. The increased vascular and endothelial fragility in FA may contribute to the higher frequency of PRES in these individuals.",

Despite restoration of long-term hematopoiesis, patients continue to remain at risk of late effects. Objectives: In our study, we aimed to reveal the problems that occur in the long-term follow-up of FA patients, and point out an ongoing need for the improvement of long-term follow-up guidelines for childhood transplant survivors with FA. Study Design: In this single centered, cross-sectional study, we analyzed the long-term outcome of 36 patients with FA according to current recommendations with a median age of 18.1 years (range: 6.1-36 years, male/female, 24/12) who underwent a HSCT at Pediatric Bone Marrow Transplantation (BMT) Unit between 1995 and 2019 and survived at least one year post-transplant. Results: The median long-term follow-up time was 8 years (range, 1-25 years). Gonadal dysfunction was detected in about 35% of our patients. 31% of the patients had hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, 4 % had hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. When the patients were evaluated for growth impairment, 7 of 12 patients who reached their final adult height and 12 of 21 patients who didn't complete their growth, had height standard deviation score below -2 SD. Three patients (9%) developed subclinical hypothyroidism, two (6%) had overt hypothyroidism and one (3%) had central hypothyroidism. Although, none of our patients fully met the criteria for metabolic syndrome, 23% of the patients had insulin resistance and 39% had dyslipidemia. Evaluation of organ dysfunctions revealed that almost 50% of the patients had obstructive and 21 % had restrictive changes in their pulmonary function tests. Hepatosteatosis was detected in 15% of the patients and mild valve dysfunction was detected in 50 % of evaluable patients. Three patients developed secondary malignancies. Squamous cell cancer developed in 2 patients and basal cell cancer in one patient. Conclusion: A risk-defined multidisciplinary approach for long-term follow up of children with FA undergoing HSCT is essential for early detection and management of late effects.",

Evaluation of organ dysfunctions revealed that almost 50% of the patients had obstructive and 21 % had restrictive changes in their pulmonary function tests. Hepatosteatosis was detected in 15% of the patients and mild valve dysfunction was detected in 50 % of evaluable patients. Three patients developed secondary malignancies. Squamous cell cancer developed in 2 patients and basal cell cancer in one patient. Conclusion: A risk-defined multidisciplinary approach for long-term follow up of children with FA undergoing HSCT is essential for early detection and management of late effects.",

Thus, management of this multisystem disorder has previously been unfamiliar to many hematologists specializing in the care of adolescents and young adults (AYA). The increased diagnosis of FA in AYA patients, facilitated by widely available germline genomic testing, improved long-term survival of children with FA following matched sibling and alternative donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) performed for BMF, and expanding need in the near future for long-term monitoring in patients achieving hematologic stabilization following ex vivo gene therapy are all reasons why management of FA in AYA populations deserves specific consideration. In this review, we address the unique challenges and evidence-based practice recommendations for the management of AYA patients with FA. Specific topics addressed include hematologic monitoring in AYA patients yet to undergo HSCT, management of myeloid malignancies occurring in FA, diagnosis and management of nonhematologic malignances and organ dysfunction in AYA patients with FA, and evolving considerations for the long-term monitoring of patients with FA undergoing gene therapy.",

A two-AAV system was employed: one virus carried a Staphylococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) expression cassette and the other harbored a U6 promoter-driven sgRNA and a fragment of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (Fah) genomic DNA as the homologous recombination donor. In neonatal mice, a gene correction frequency of ~10.8% of hepatocytes was achieved. The efficiency in adult mice was significantly lower at ~1.6%. To determine whether hepatocyte replication could enhance the targeting frequency, cell division was induced with thyroid hormone T3. This more than doubled the gene correction efficiency to 3.5% (p < 0.005). To determine whether SpCas9 delivery was rate limiting, the gene repair AAV was administered to SpCas9 transgenic mice. However, this did not significantly enhance gene repair. Finally, we tested whether the Fanconi anemia (FA) DNA repair pathway was important in hepatocyte gene repair. Gene correction frequencies were significantly lower in neonatal mice lacking the FA complementation group A (Fanca) gene. Taken together, we conclude that pharmacological induction of hepatocyte replication along with manipulation of DNA repair pathways could be a useful strategy for enhancing in vivo gene correction.",

GR risk factors are well published, but there are no reliable biomarkers or therapies known. Fever is the most common symptom of GR, but no study has evaluated fever kinetics as a diagnostic marker of GR. The objectives of this study were to identify mechanisms, biomarkers, and potential therapies for GR after HCT. Chemokine ligand 9 (CXCL9), B-cell activating factor (BAFF), and complement markers (sC5b-9, C3a, and C5a) were measured in 7 patients with GR and compared with 15 HCT controls. All patients had a diagnosis of aplastic anemia, Fanconi anemia, or genetically undefined chromosomal fragility syndrome. All patients with GR were febrile during GR; therefore, control patients who underwent HCT were matched for diagnosis and early fevers after HCT. Patients withh GR had significantly higher CXCL9, BAFF, and sC5b-9 at the time of fever and GR compared with control patients who underwent HCT at the time of fever. The maximum fever was significantly higher and occurred significantly later in the transplant course in patients with GR compared with febrile HCT controls. These data support the use of CXCL9, BAFF, sC5b-9, and fever kinetics as GR markers. Two patients with GR underwent a second HCT that was complicated by high fevers. Both patients received interferon and complement blockers during their second HCT, and both preserved their graft. These laboratory and clinical findings support larger studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of interferon, complement, and BAFF inhibitors for the prevention and treatment of GR after HCT.",

                    "abstract": "Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) can cure blood dyscrasias and reduce the risk of hematologic cancers in patients with inherited bone marrow failure syndromes (IBMFS). However, because of its high mortality rate, HCT is generally reserved until patients with IBMFS manifest life-threatening cytopenias or myeloid malignancy, at which point outcomes are poor. Screening tests that accurately predict transformation and enable timely intervention are lacking. These unknowns and risks limit the use of HCT in patients with IBMFS, sometimes until significant disease-related sequelae have occurred. A major goal for IBMFS is to reduce cellular therapy-related complications to the point that earlier intervention can be considered before significant transfusion exposure, occurrence of comorbidities, or malignant transformation. In recent decades, disease-specific allogeneic HCT trials have yielded significant improvements in outcomes in IBMFS conditions, including Fanconi anemia and dyskeratosis congenita. This is in large part due to marked reductions in conditioning intensity to address the increased sensitivity of these patients to cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation. The success of these approaches may also indicate an ability to leverage intrinsic fitness defects of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells across IBMFS disorders. Now with advances in tracking somatic genetic evolution in hematopoiesis and tailored minimal intensity conditioning regimens, this question arises: is it time for preventative HCT for IBMFS?",

The aim of our study is to evaluate the impact and benefits of allogenic matched donor HSCT in a case of a 12 year-old girl with FA, who displayed good clinical evolution following 2 months post-transplantation. METHODS: In the pre-transplant phase, reference blood samples from the donor and recipient were collected on EDTA. The DNA from blood samples was extracted using an automated Maxwell  48 RSC instrument (Promega, USA) with the Maxwell  RSC Whole blood DNA kit (Promega, USA). For DNA quantification, the PowerQuant System kit (Promega, USA) was used with the ABI 7500 Real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, USA). The amplification of the short tandem repeat markers was performed using the 24plex Investigator QS kit (Qiagen, Germany) on a ProFlex PCR System. Furthermore, the PCR products were separated and detected on an ABI 3500 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosytems, USA). RESULTS: Thirty days post transplantation, a complete chimerism (CC) was achieved with a full replacement by do-nor derived hematopoietic cells. Sixty days post transplantation, the CC status was maintained with improvement of hematological findings. CONCLUSIONS: In FA, chimerism monitoring after HSCT provides useful information regarding engraftment or possibility of post-transplantation complications such as graft versus host disease.",

Treatment is complicated by high vulnerability to treatment-associated side effects, yet structured data are lacking. This study aims at giving a comprehensive overview about clinical and molecular characteristics of pediatric FA MB patients. METHODS: Clinical data including detailed information on treatment and toxicities of six previously unreported FA MB patients were supplemented with data of 16 published cases. RESULTS: We identified 22 cases of children with FA and MB with clinical data available. All MBs with subgroup reporting were SHH-activated (n=9), confirmed by methylation profiling in five patients. FA MB patients exclusively belonged to complementation groups FA-D1 (n=16) or FA-N (n=3). Patients were treated with postoperative chemotherapy only (50%) or radiotherapy (RT)+-chemotherapy (27%). 23% did not receive adjuvant therapy. Excessive treatment-related toxicities were frequent. Severe hematological toxicity occurred in 91% of patients treated with alkylating chemotherapy, while non-alkylating agents and RT were less toxic. Median overall survival (OS) was 1 year (95%CI 0.3-1.8). 1-year-progression-free-survival (PFS) was 26.3+-10.1% and 1-year-OS was 42.1+-11.3%. Adjuvant therapy prolonged survival (1y-OS/1y-PFS 0%/0% without adjuvant therapy vs. 53.3+-12.9%/33.3+-12.2% with adjuvant therapy, p=0.006/p=0.086). CONCLUSIONS: MB in FA patients is strongly associated with SHH activation and FA-D1/FA-N. Despite the dismal prognosis, adjuvant therapy may prolong survival. Non-alkylating chemotherapy and RT are feasible in selected patients with careful monitoring of toxicities and dose adjustments. Curative therapy for FA MB-SHH remains an unmet medical need.",

While several nontransplant treatments are currently under evaluation, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains the only therapeutic option for bone marrow failure (BMF). Although HSCT outcomes in patients with FA have remarkably improved over the past 20 years, in addition to the mortality intrinsic to the procedure, HSCT increases the risk and accelerates the appearance of late malignancies. HSCT offers the best outcome when performed in optimal conditions (moderate cytopenia shifting to severe, prior to transfusion dependence and before clonal evolution or myelodysplasia/acute myeloid leukemia); hence, an accurate surveillance program is vital. Haploidentical HSCT offers very good outcomes, although long-term effects on malignancies have not been fully explored. A monitoring plan is also important to identify cancers, particularly head and neck carcinomas, in very early phases. Gene therapy is still experimental and offers the most encouraging results when performed in early phases of BMF by infusing high numbers of corrected cells without genotoxic effects. Patients with FA need comprehensive monitoring and care plans, coordinated by centers with expertise in FA management, that start at diagnosis and continue throughout life. Such long-term follow-up is essential to detect complications related to the disease or treatment in this setting.",

                    "abstract": "Fanconi anemia is the most common inherited bone marrow failure syndrome, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative option. Post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) is challenging in this group of children, given their increased sensitivity to chemotherapy. We performed a retrospective analysis of the data on children diagnosed with Fanconi anemia who underwent a haploidentical HSCT with PTCy from January 2014 to December 2019. Nineteen children (male/female, 0.75:1) underwent 21 haplo-HSCTs with PTCy. Fludarabine, low-dose cyclophosphamide, and 200 centi-gray total body irradiation were included in the conditioning regimen with 25 mg/kg PTCy on days +3 and +4. Haplo-graft was from a sibling in 38% and father in 57% of transplants. The source of stem cells was peripheral blood stem cells in 81% and bone marrow in 19% of transplants, with a median CD34 dose of 5.0 x 106/kg. We documented engraftment in 84% and primary graft failure in 10% of transplants. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) was infused concomitantly during cyclophosphamide in 13 children. Grade 2 and 3 mucositis was lower among those who received NAC as compared to those who did not (30% and 15% versus 33% and 50%), while transaminitis was higher among those who did not receive the infusion. The incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was 68%, and 81% of these were steroid responsive (grade I/II). We documented chronic GVHD in 25% children, predominantly involving the skin and mouth, which responded to low-dose steroids and ruxolitinib. Serum ferritin was monitored twice weekly as a surrogate marker for cytokine release syndrome due to nonavailability of IL-6 levels. A 1- or 2-log increase in the titers of ferritin associated with clinical features guided the early addition of steroids in the periengraftment period. The mean survival was found to be less among those with high serum ferritin (>10,000 ng/dL) in the periengraftment period as compared to those with ferritin <10,000 ng/dL (mean survival of 25 +- 10 months versus 50 +- 6 months, respectively). The overall survival in our cohort was 68.4%, with a mean survival time of 41.5 months (95% confidence interval, 29.3 to 53.8 months), with a statistically significant correlation between inferior outcome and having received over 15 transfusions before HSCT (P = .01). PTCy can be considered a viable option in children with Fanconi anemia, particularly in resource-limited settings given the high costs of HSCTs. Focused interventions in this subset of children help improve survival outcomes. Early identification of cytokine release syndrome and risk-adapted steroid therapy during engraftment helps prevent mortality. The concomitant use of NAC during cyclophosphamide infusion helps reduce oxygen free radical related tissue damage and regimen-related toxicity.",

We previously reported that monotherapy with either metformin (MET) or oxymetholone (OXM) improved peripheral blood (PB) counts and the number and functionality of bone marrow hematopoietic stem progenitor cells (HSPCs) number in Fancd2-/- mice. To evaluate whether the combination treatment of these drugs has a synergistic effect to prevent bone marrow failure in FA, we treated cohorts of Fancd2-/- mice and wildtype controls with either MET alone, OXM alone, MET+OXM, or placebo diet from age 3 weeks to 18 months. The OXM treated animals showed modest improvements in blood parameters including platelet count (p = .01) and hemoglobin levels (p < .05). In addition, the percentage of quiescent hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) (LSK [Lin-Sca+c-Kit+]) was significantly increased (p = .001) by long-term treatment with MET alone. The combination of metformin and oxymetholone did not result in a significant synergistic effect in any hematopoietic parameter. Gene expression analysis of liver tissue from these animals showed that some of the expression changes caused by Fancd2 deletion were partially normalized by metformin treatment. Importantly, no adverse effects of the individual or combination therapies were observed, despite the long-term administration. We conclude that androgen therapy is not a contraindication to concurrent metformin administration in clinical trials. HIGHLIGHTS: Long-term coadministration of metformin in combination with oxymetholone is well tolerated by Fancd2-/- mice. Hematopoietic stem cell quiescence in mutant mice was enhanced by treatment with metformin alone. Metformin treatment caused a partial normalization of gene expression in the livers of mutant mice.",

                    "abstract": "Fanconi anemia (FA) is a disease caused by defective deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair that manifests as bone marrow failure, cancer predisposition, and developmental defects. We previously reported that monotherapy with either metformin (MET) or oxymetholone (OXM) improved peripheral blood (PB) counts and the number and functionality of bone marrow hematopoietic stem progenitor cells (HSPCs) number in Fancd2-/- mice. To evaluate whether the combination treatment of these drugs has a synergistic effect to prevent bone marrow failure in FA, we treated cohorts of Fancd2-/- mice and wildtype controls with either MET alone, OXM alone, MET+OXM, or placebo diet from age 3 weeks to 18 months. The OXM treated animals showed modest improvements in blood parameters including platelet count (p = .01) and hemoglobin levels (p < .05). In addition, the percentage of quiescent hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) (LSK [Lin-Sca+c-Kit+]) was significantly increased (p = .001) by long-term treatment with MET alone. The combination of metformin and oxymetholone did not result in a significant synergistic effect in any hematopoietic parameter. Gene expression analysis of liver tissue from these animals showed that some of the expression changes caused by Fancd2 deletion were partially normalized by metformin treatment. Importantly, no adverse effects of the individual or combination therapies were observed, despite the long-term administration. We conclude that androgen therapy is not a contraindication to concurrent metformin administration in clinical trials. HIGHLIGHTS: Long-term coadministration of metformin in combination with oxymetholone is well tolerated by Fancd2-/- mice. Hematopoietic stem cell quiescence in mutant mice was enhanced by treatment with metformin alone. Metformin treatment caused a partial normalization of gene expression in the livers of mutant mice.",

FA is caused by a defective repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks and to date, mutations in over 20 genes have been linked to the disease. Advances in science and molecular biology have provided new insight between FA gene mutations and the severity of clinical manifestations. Here, we will highlight the current and promising therapeutic options for this rare disease. The current standard treatment for FA patients is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, a treatment associated to exposure to radiation or chemotherapy, immunological complications, plus opportunistic infections from prolonged immune incompetence or increased risk of morbidity. New arising treatments include gene addition therapy, genome editing using CRISPR-Cas9 nuclease, and hematopoietic stem cell generation from induced pluripotent stem cells. Finally, we will also discuss the revolutionary developments in mRNA therapeutics as an opportunity for this disease.",

Most of the non-TBI conditioning regimens use an ex vivo T-cell depletion approach, but this is not feasible at all pediatric stem cell transplant programs. To evaluate the success of HSCT in patients with FA using non-TBI conditioning regimens with in vivo T-cell depletion approach. HSCT using non-TBI based conditioning was performed on two siblings with FA. The first sibling underwent matched unrelated donor transplant with a BM graft using fludarabine, alemtuzumab, busulfan, and cyclophosphamide conditioning and cyclosporine and mycophenolate as GVHD prophylaxis. The second sibling underwent MSD transplant with UCB and BM grafts using similar approach, but without busulfan and mycophenolate. Both siblings had engraftment without signs of acute or chronic GVHD. Acute post-transplant complications included brief viral reactivations. At last follow-up, both siblings continued to have full immune reconstitution with stable chimerism. Conditioning regimens without radiation and inclusion of alemtuzumab can lead to successful engraftment without development of GVHD and reduce risk of developing secondary neoplasms, even with unrelated donor transplants.",

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), a mainstay treatment, is limited by conditioning regimen-related toxicity and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Antibody-drug-conjugates (ADCs) targeting hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) can open marrow niches permitting donor stem cell alloengraftment. Here, we report that single dose anti-mouse CD45-targeted-ADC (CD45-ADC) facilitated stable, multilineage chimerism in 3 distinct FA mouse models representing 90% of FA complementation groups. CD45-ADC profoundly depleted host stem cell enriched Lineage Sca1+cKit+ cells within 48 hours. Fanca-/- recipients of minor-mismatched BM and single dose CD45-ADC had peripheral blood (PB) mean donor chimerism >90%; donor HSCs alloengraftment was verified in secondary recipients. In Fancc-/- and Fancg-/- recipients of fully allogeneic grafts, PB mean donor chimerism was 60-80% and 70-80%, respectively. The mean percent donor chimerism in BM and spleen mirrored PB results. CD45-ADC conditioned mice did not have clinical toxicity. A transient <2.5-fold increase in hepatocellular enzymes and mild-to-moderate histopathological changes were seen. Under GVHD allo-HSCT conditions, wildtype and Fanca-/- recipients of CD45-ADC had markedly reduced GVHD lethality compared to lethal irradiation. Moreover, single dose anti-human CD45-ADC given to rhesus macaque nonhuman primates on days -6 or -10 was at least as myeloablative as lethal irradiation. These data suggest that CD45-ADC can potently promote donor alloengraftment and hematopoiesis without significant toxicity or severe GVHD, as seen with lethal irradiation, providing strong support for clinical trial considerations in highly vulnerable FA patients.",

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 42 patients diagnosed with IBMFS and transplanted with an alternative donor graft at our center from November 2012 to August 2018. Twenty-seven patients had Fanconi anemia (FA), 7 had dyskeratosis congenita (DC), and 8 had severe congenital neutropenia (SCN). Patients received ex-vivo unmanipulated alternative donor grafts from a matched unrelated donor (MUD) (n = 22), haploidentical donor (HID) (n = 17) and unrelated cord blood donor (UCBD) (n = 3). FA and DC patient subgroups received reduce intensified conditioning (RIC), while SCN patients received a myeloablative conditioning (MAC) regimen. Results: The median follow-up time for the surviving patients was 38 months (range: 9-63 months). The failure-free survival (FFS) for entire cohort was 76.1%, and was 72.4%, 100% and 56.2% for patients with FA, DC and SCN, respectively. There were no primary graft failures.

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: The DNA damage immune response (DDIR) assay was developed in breast cancer based on biology associated with deficiencies in homologous recombination and Fanconi anemia pathways. A positive DDIR call identifies patients likely to respond to platinum-based chemotherapies in breast and esophageal cancers. In colorectal cancer, there is currently no biomarker to predict response to oxaliplatin. We tested the ability of the DDIR assay to predict response to oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in colorectal cancer and characterized the biology in DDIR-positive colorectal cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Samples and clinical data were assessed according to DDIR status from patients who received either 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or 5FUFA (bolus and infusion 5-FU with folinic acid) plus oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) within the FOCUS trial (n = 361, stage IV), or neoadjuvant FOLFOX in the FOxTROT trial (n = 97, stage II/III). Whole transcriptome, mutation, and IHC data of these samples were used to interrogate the biology of DDIR in colorectal cancer. RESULTS: Contrary to our hypothesis, DDIR-negative patients displayed a trend toward improved outcome for oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy compared with DDIR-positive patients. DDIR positivity was associated with microsatellite instability (MSI) and colorectal molecular subtype 1. Refinement of the DDIR signature, based on overlapping IFN-related chemokine signaling associated with DDIR positivity across colorectal cancer and breast cancer cohorts, further confirmed that the DDIR assay did not have predictive value for oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in colorectal cancer. CONCLUSIONS: DDIR positivity does not predict improved response following oxaliplatin treatment in colorectal cancer. However, data presented here suggest the potential of the DDIR assay in identifying immune-rich tumors that may benefit from immune checkpoint blockade, beyond current use of MSI status.",

PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors upregulate T-cell killing of cancer cells and is a class of promising treatment for FA-AML. Here, we developed a novel FA-AML murine model that allows the study of human AML with a humanized immune system in order to investigate immunotherapeutic treatments in vivo. FA-AML1 cells and non-FA-mutated Kasumi-1 cells were injected into 8-10 week old NSG mice. Once leukemic engraftment was confirmed by HLA-DR expression in the peripheral blood, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMCs) were injected into the mice. One week post-hPBMCs injection, Nivolumab (PD-1 inhibitor) or PBS vehicle control was administered to the mice bi-weekly. In our Nivolumab treated mice, FA-AML1, but not Kasumi-1-engrafted mice, had significantly prolonged overall survival. Both FA-AML1 and Kasumi-1 engrafted mice had decreased spleen weights. Higher leukemic infiltration into vital organs was observed in FA-AML1 engrafted mice compared to Kasumi-1 engrafted mice. In conclusion, our novel humanized murine model of FA-mutated AML is an attractive tool for supporting further studies and clinical trials using PD-1 inhibitors to treat FA-mutated AML.",

STUDY DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional observational study of 106 consecutive patients with confirmed diagnosis of FA who were followed at the Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) Service at the Federal University of Parana, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil. Participants underwent a complete ophthalmologic evaluation and 84 patients underwent ocular ultrasound examination. This study was conducted between November 2014 and August 2017. RESULTS: The patients ranged in age from 6 months to 43 years of age. Microphthalmia was the most common congenital ocular abnormality (95.2%). A decrease in anthropometric measurements was observed, including palpebral fissure length (78/103 patients [76.5%]), microcornea (48/103 patients [46.6%]), and ptosis (31/103 patients [30.1%]). We identified a new ophthalmic condition in 15 patients with FA, that is, epiretinal tissue on the optic disc. The genetic subtype was identified in 78 patients (79.6%), the FA-A subtype was most prevalent (50%). The most common acquired ocular manifestation (non-graft-versus-host disease [GVHD] related) in patients who did not undergo HSCT (n = 44) was limbal neovascularization (13.6%), whereas in patients who underwent HSCT (n = 62), the GVHD-related manifestation was ocular GVHD (51.6%). The most frequent symptom of ocular GVHD was keratoconjunctivitis sicca (29%). CONCLUSIONS: Several ocular manifestations were identified in patients with FA.",

This CPS is focused on the risk of secondary oral cancer following hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). METHODS: This CPS was developed based on critical evaluation of the literature followed by a structured discussion of a group of leading experts, members of the Oral Care Study Group of MASCC/ISOO. The information is presented in the form of succinct bullets to generate a short manual about the best standard of care. RESULTS: Studies described a 7-16-fold higher risk of secondary oral cancer (mainly squamous cell carcinoma) in allogeneic HCT (alloHCT) recipients, particularly in those who developed chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD). Risk increases over time and is influenced by several risk factors. In autologous HCT, oral cancer risk seemed only slightly elevated. CONCLUSION: Clinicians should be aware of the higher oral cancer risk in alloHCT survivors, and emphasize the importance of lifelong oral cancer surveillance (at least every 6-12 months) and avoiding cancer promoting lifestyle factors in an empathic way, particularly of those with (a history of) cGVHD. Post-HCT for Fanconi anemia or dyskeratosis congenita, education and rigorous follow-up is even more crucial. In case of suspected oral lesions in the presence of oral mucosal cGVHD, a GVHD intervention may facilitate diagnosis. Suspected lesions should be biopsied. More research is needed on the role of HPV in oral cancer post-HCT.",

We performed a retrospective multicenter study on 813 FA children undergoing first HSCT between 2010 and 2018. Median duration of follow-up was 3.7 years (interquartile range, 3.4-4.0). Median age at transplant was 8.8 years (6.5-18.1). Overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS) and GvHD-free, relapse-free survival (GRFS) at 5 years were 83% (80-86%), 78% (75-81%) and 70% (67-74%) respectively. OS was comparable between matched family donor (MFD, n=441, 88%) and matched unrelated donor (MUD, n=162, 86%) and was superior to that of mismatched family or unrelated donor (MMFD/MMUD, n=144, 72%) and haploidentical donor (HID) (n=66, 70%, p<0.001). In multivariable analysis, a transplant indication of acute myeloid leukaemia/myelodysplastic syndrome compared to AA/BMF, use of MMFD/MMUD and HID compared to MFD, Fludarabine-Cyclophosphamide (FluCy) + other conditioning compared to FluCy independently predicted inferior OS, while alemtuzumab compared to ATG was associated with better OS. Age   10 years was associated with worse EFS and GRFS. Cumulative incidences (CIN) of primary and secondary graft failure were 2% (1-3%) and 3% (2-4%) respectively. CIN of grade II-IV acute GvHD, grade III-IV acute GvHD and chronic GvHD were 23% (20-26%), 12% (10-15%) and 8% (6-10%) respectively. The 5-year CIN of secondary malignancy was 2% (1-3%).

In the present study, we report eight patients with rare diseases who underwent OTC in China's first and largest ovarian tissue cryobank. Procedure: Data from girls with rare diseases who underwent OTC between September 2020 and November 2022 were retrospectively analyzed. We also compared the number of cryopreserved cortex pieces, follicle number, and AMH in those with rare diseases and age-matched children with non-rare diseases who also underwent OTC in our cryobank. Results: The median age of the children was 5.88 +- 3.52 (range 2-13) years old. Unilateral oophorectomy was undertaken via laparoscopy in all of the children. The diseases in the 8 patients were: 4 mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS I two cases, IVA two cases), 1 Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA), 1 Fanconi anemia (FA), 1 hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome (HIES), 1 Niemann-Pick disease. The number of cryopreserved cortex pieces was 17.13 +- 6.36, and the follicle count per 2 mm biopsy was 447.38 +- 524.35. No significant difference in age, the count of cryopreserved cortex pieces, follicle number per 2 mm biopsy, and AMH level was seen between the 20 children with non-rare diseases and those with rare diseases. Conclusions: The reports help practitioners counsel girls with rare diseases about fertility preservation. The demand for OTC in pediatrics will likely grow as a standard of care.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Fanconi anemia (FA) is a genetic disorder that impairs the function of the bone marrow and predisposes individuals to aplastic anemia. The condition is caused by mutations in genes responsible for DNA repair. People with FA have an increased risk of developing tumors due to DNA damage. Flat-cell carcinomas of the head, neck, esophagus, and genital organs are often observed in individuals with FA. CASE REPORT A 31-year-old man with Fanconi anemia and a history of bone marrow transplantation was admitted to the General Surgery Department due to elevated levels of the CEA marker. Before the transplantation, chromosomal anomalies, bone marrow hypoplasia, kidney agenesis, and bone defects were noted. After the transplantation, he developed a skin rash. He was also diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the lip and chronic conditions, including cholestatic liver damage, hypertension, and hypothyroidism. During the diagnostic process, computed tomography showed signs of Barrett's esophagus, numerous polyps in the stomach and intestines, and a nodular formation measuring 4.5x5x5.5 cm in the right iliac region. Laparoscopy revealed a neoplasm of the appendix with numerous metastases on the inner abdominal wall and omentum. Histological analysis confirmed mucinous appendiceal cancer. The patient was discharged for palliative treatment at the Oncology Center with a final diagnosis of appendiceal cancer, mucinous type, grade G3. This case underscores the importance of early and comprehensive cancer screening in individuals with FA, particularly those with a history of bone marrow transplantation. CONCLUSIONS This clinical case underscores the critical importance of thorough and timely cancer diagnosis in individuals with this genetic pathology.",

In this study, we explored interventions designed to further enhance in vivo hepatocyte gene repair in a model of hereditary tyrosinemia. A two-AAV system was employed: one virus carried a Staphylococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) expression cassette and the other harbored a U6 promoter-driven sgRNA and a fragment of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (Fah) genomic DNA as the homologous recombination donor. In neonatal mice, a gene correction frequency of ~10.8% of hepatocytes was achieved. The efficiency in adult mice was significantly lower at ~1.6%. To determine whether hepatocyte replication could enhance the targeting frequency, cell division was induced with thyroid hormone T3. This more than doubled the gene correction efficiency to 3.5% (p < 0.005). To determine whether SpCas9 delivery was rate limiting, the gene repair AAV was administered to SpCas9 transgenic mice. However, this did not significantly enhance gene repair. Finally, we tested whether the Fanconi anemia (FA) DNA repair pathway was important in hepatocyte gene repair. Gene correction frequencies were significantly lower in neonatal mice lacking the FA complementation group A (Fanca) gene. Taken together, we conclude that pharmacological induction of hepatocyte replication along with manipulation of DNA repair pathways could be a useful strategy for enhancing in vivo gene correction.",

However, PT-CY is difficult in patients with Fanconi anemia (FA) due to their high vulnerability to alkylating agents. For FA, we prefer haplo-SCT by T-cell receptor alphabetaT-cell and B-cell depletion (alphabetaT/B-depleted haplo-SCT), which can reduce the risks of PT-CY-related complications and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). An 11-year-old boy with diagnosed FA (FANCG mutation) and bone marrow failure was to receive alphabetaT/B-depleted haplo-SCT from his father (HLA 4/8 allele matched) due to absence of an HLA-matched donors. alphabetaT/B-depleted peripheral blood stem cells (CD34 + cell count, 1.17 x 107/kg; alphabeta + T-cell count, 1.3 x 105/kg) were infused following conditioning consisting of fludarabine (150 mg/m2), cyclophosphamide (40 mg/kg), anti-thymocyte globulin (5 mg/kg), rituximab (375 mg/m2), and thoraco-abdominal irradiation (3 Gy). Tacrolimus was used for GVHD prophylaxis until day + 30. Neutrophil engraftment was achieved on day + 9, and complete chimerism was confirmed on days + 28 and + 96. At 12-month post-SCT, the patient was well without GVHD or any other complications. alphabetaT/B-depleted haplo-SCT is a good choice not only for patients unsuitable for PT-CY, but also for all pediatric recipients to reduce SCT-related complications.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Outcome of children with medulloblastoma (MB) and Fanconi Anemia (FA), an inherited DNA repair deficiency, has not been described systematically. Treatment is complicated by high vulnerability to treatment-associated side effects, yet structured data are lacking. This study aims at giving a comprehensive overview about clinical and molecular characteristics of pediatric FA MB patients. METHODS: Clinical data including detailed information on treatment and toxicities of six previously unreported FA MB patients were supplemented with data of 16 published cases. RESULTS: We identified 22 cases of children with FA and MB with clinical data available. All MBs with subgroup reporting were SHH-activated (n=9), confirmed by methylation profiling in five patients. FA MB patients exclusively belonged to complementation groups FA-D1 (n=16) or FA-N (n=3). Patients were treated with postoperative chemotherapy only (50%) or radiotherapy (RT)+-chemotherapy (27%). 23% did not receive adjuvant therapy. Excessive treatment-related toxicities were frequent. Severe hematological toxicity occurred in 91% of patients treated with alkylating chemotherapy, while non-alkylating agents and RT were less toxic. Median overall survival (OS) was 1 year (95%CI 0.3-1.8). 1-year-progression-free-survival (PFS) was 26.3+-10.1% and 1-year-OS was 42.1+-11.3%. Adjuvant therapy prolonged survival (1y-OS/1y-PFS 0%/0% without adjuvant therapy vs. 53.3+-12.9%/33.3+-12.2% with adjuvant therapy, p=0.006/p=0.086). CONCLUSIONS: MB in FA patients is strongly associated with SHH activation and FA-D1/FA-N. Despite the dismal prognosis, adjuvant therapy may prolong survival. Non-alkylating chemotherapy and RT are feasible in selected patients with careful monitoring of toxicities and dose adjustments. Curative therapy for FA MB-SHH remains an unmet medical need.",

                    "abstract": "The advent of new technologies has made it possible to identify genetic predispositions to myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute leukemias (AL) more frequently. The most frequent and best characterized at present are mutations in CEBPA, RUNX1, GATA2, ETV6 and DDX41 and, either in the presence of one of these mutations with a high allelic frequency, or in the case of a personal or family history suggestive of blood abnormalities such as non-immune thrombocytopenia, it is recommended to look for the possibility of a hereditary hematological malignancy (HHM). Indeed, early recognition of these HHMs allows better adaptation of the management of patients and their relatives, as allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is very often proposed for these pathologies. According to current data, with the exception of the GATA2 mutation, the constitutional or somatic nature of the mutations does not seem to influence the prognosis of hematological diseases. Therefore, the indication for an allograft will be determined according to the usual criteria. However, when searching for a family donor, it is important to ensure that there is no hereditary disease in the donor. In order to guarantee the possibility of performing the HSC allograft within a short period of time, it may be necessary to initiate a parallel procedure to find an unrelated donor. Given the limited information on the modalities of HSC transplantation in this setting, it is important to assess the benefit/risk of the disease and the procedure to decide on the type of conditioning (myeloablative or reduced intensity). In view of the limited experience with the risk of secondary cancers in the medium and long-term, it may be appropriate to recommend reduced intensity conditioning, as in the case of better characterized syndromic hematological diseases such as Fanconi anemia or telomere diseases. In summary, it seems important to evoke HHM more frequently, particularly in the presence of a family history, certain mutations or persistent blood abnormalities, in order to discuss the specific modalities of HSC allografting, particularly with regard to the search for a donor and the evaluation of certain modalities of the procedure, such as conditioning. It should be noted that the discovery of HHM, especially if the indication of an allogeneic HSC transplant is retained, will raise ethical and psychological considerations not only for the patient, but also for his family. A multidisciplinary approach involving molecular biologists, geneticists, hematologists and psychologists is essential.",

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to explore the mechanism by which HBO treats spinal cord injury (SCI) at the level of lncRNAs. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Immense amounts of research have established that HBO treatment promotes the recovery of neurological function after SCI. The mechanism of action remains to be clarified. METHODS: High-throughput RNA sequencing, Gene Ontology, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis were used to profile lncRNA expression and analyze biological function in the spinal cords of mice from sham-operated, SCI, and HBO-treated groups. The differential expression of lncRNA between the groups was assessed using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Differential expression across 577 lncRNAs was identified among the three groups. GO analysis showed that free ubiquitin chain polymerization, ubiquitin homeostasis, DNA replication, synthesis of RNA primer, single-stranded telomeric DNA binding, and alpha-amylase activity were significantly enriched. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis displayed that vitamin B6 metabolism, one carbon pool by folate, DNA replication, lysine degradation, beta-alanine metabolism, fanconi anemia pathway, and Notch signal pathway were the main pathways with enrichment significance. LncRNAs NONMMUT 092674.1, NONMMUT042986.2, and NONMMUT018850.2 showed significantly different expression between the SCI and the other two groups (P<0.05, <0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to determine the expression profiles of lncRNAs in the injured spinal cord after HBO treatment. We identified several important dysregulated lncRNAs in this setting. These results help us better understand the mechanism by which HBO treats SCI and provide new potential therapeutic targets for SCI.",

Of the 31 patients with SAA, 19 had acquired aplastic anemia, 2 had Diamond Blackfan anemia and 10 had Fanconi anemia. Donors were either matched sibling (n=29), related donors (n=2), or unrelated donors (n=3). Peripheral blood stem cells were the graft source in all the cases except 1. Fludarabine-based reduced intensity conditioning was used in all except for patients with a diagnosis of Diamond Blackfan anemia. All patients except 1 achieved hematologic recovery in the form of neutrophil engraftment at 13 days (range, 9 to 17), whereas platelet engraftment occurred at 14 days (range, 10 to 18). Graft versus host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine and methotrexate +-antithymocyte globulin (horse/rabbit). Acute GvHD developed in 12.9% patients, whereas no patients developed chronic GvHD till the time of last follow-up. The 2-year overall survival for the entire cohort was 93.21+-4.6%. In patients with SAA, allogeneic stem cell transplant using fludarabine-based conditioning regimens are very well tolerated and have excellent outcomes in a full match setting.",

                    "abstract": "The advent of new technologies has made it possible to identify genetic predispositions to myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute leukemias (AL) more frequently. The most frequent and best characterized at present are mutations in CEBPA, RUNX1, GATA2, ETV6 and DDX41 and, either in the presence of one of these mutations with a high allelic frequency, or in the case of a personal or family history suggestive of blood abnormalities such as non-immune thrombocytopenia, it is recommended to look for the possibility of a hereditary hematological malignancy (HHM). Indeed, early recognition of these HHMs allows better adaptation of the management of patients and their relatives, as allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is very often proposed for these pathologies. According to current data, with the exception of the GATA2 mutation, the constitutional or somatic nature of the mutations does not seem to influence the prognosis of hematological diseases. Therefore, the indication for an allograft will be determined according to the usual criteria. However, when searching for a family donor, it is important to ensure that there is no hereditary disease in the donor. In order to guarantee the possibility of performing the HSC allograft within a short period of time, it may be necessary to initiate a parallel procedure to find an unrelated donor. Given the limited information on the modalities of HSC transplantation in this setting, it is important to assess the benefit/risk of the disease and the procedure to decide on the type of conditioning (myeloablative or reduced intensity). In view of the limited experience with the risk of secondary cancers in the medium and long-term, it may be appropriate to recommend reduced intensity conditioning, as in the case of better characterized syndromic hematological diseases such as Fanconi anemia or telomere diseases. In summary, it seems important to evoke HHM more frequently, particularly in the presence of a family history, certain mutations or persistent blood abnormalities, in order to discuss the specific modalities of HSC allografting, particularly with regard to the search for a donor and the evaluation of certain modalities of the procedure, such as conditioning. It should be noted that the discovery of HHM, especially if the indication of an allogeneic HSC transplant is retained, will raise ethical and psychological considerations not only for the patient, but also for his family. A multidisciplinary approach involving molecular biologists, geneticists, hematologists and psychologists is essential.",

Our study is to demonstrate that IBMFS with disease-specific characteristics requires a tailored conditioning regimens to enhance engraftment and reduce regimen related toxicities. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 42 patients diagnosed with IBMFS and transplanted with an alternative donor graft at our center from November 2012 to August 2018. Twenty-seven patients had Fanconi anemia (FA), 7 had dyskeratosis congenita (DC), and 8 had severe congenital neutropenia (SCN). Patients received ex-vivo unmanipulated alternative donor grafts from a matched unrelated donor (MUD) (n = 22), haploidentical donor (HID) (n = 17) and unrelated cord blood donor (UCBD) (n = 3). FA and DC patient subgroups received reduce intensified conditioning (RIC), while SCN patients received a myeloablative conditioning (MAC) regimen. Results: The median follow-up time for the surviving patients was 38 months (range: 9-63 months). The failure-free survival (FFS) for entire cohort was 76.1%, and was 72.4%, 100% and 56.2% for patients with FA, DC and SCN, respectively. There were no primary graft failures. The cumulative incidence of aGVHD at day 100 was 48.1%. The cumulative incidence of cGVHD at 1 and 3 years was 35.0% and 69.3%, respectively. Conclusion: HSCT using alternative donors with unmanipulated grafts and disease-specific conditioning regimens for IBMFS patients shows promising survival.",

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative treatment for bone marrow failure and the hematologic malignancies these patients develop. Given the sensitivity of FA patients to chemotherapy and radiation, as to the clinical symptoms of graft versus host disease (GvHD), HSCT in these patients is challenging. Since the mid-nineties, HSCT for FA patients is performed in our center by using the fludarabine based reduced-intensity protocol. AIMS: To summarize the results of HSCT for patients with FA using a fludarabine based reduced-intensity conditioning regimen at the Hadassah Medical Center. METHODS: This retrospective research is based on the collection and analysis of clinical and laboratory data from the medical records of patients. RESULTS: Since June 1996 up till February 2020, 39 patients with FA underwent 43 HSCTs with a fludarabine based protocol at the Hadassah Medical Center. Four patients required a second transplant due to primary engraftment failure. Nine patients (23%) suffered from acute GvHD, four of them severe. Eight patients (20%) developed chronic GvHD, two with an extensive and debilitating disease. Thirty-three (85%) of the patients survived and six died, five shortly after the transplant, and one twenty years later from malignancy. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show high survival rates with low rates of engraftment failure and reasonable rates of GvHD. DISCUSSION: As of today, there is an effective and safe treatment for patients with FA who require HSCT by using a fludarabine-based reduced-intensity conditioning regimen, with high survival rates and few complications.",

Post-transplantation kidney injury is a common complication and involves a wide spectrum of structural abnormalities, including glomerular (MSPGN, mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis; FSGS, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis; MPGN, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis; MCD, minimal change disease), vascular (TMA, thrombotic microangiopathy), and/or tubulointerstitial (TIN, tubulointerstitial nephritis; ATI, acute tubular injury). Renal biopsy is the gold-standard examination for defining multiple etiologies of kidney impairment. Although kidney injury following HSCT has been studied, little is known about the effects of allo-HSCT on renal pathology in pediatric patients. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed renal biopsy specimens from children with kidney injury after allo-HSCT and correlated results with clinical data in the last 10 years. RESULTS: Among 25 children (18 males and 7 females), three patients had proteinuria indicating nephrotic syndrome (24-hour urinary total protein/weight > 50 mg/kg/d), nine patients had severely reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m2) and four patients received kidney replacement therapy (KRT). The main pathologies identified from kidney biopsies were MSPGN (n = 12), FSGS (n = 12), MPGN (n = 5), TMA (n = 4), MCD (n = 3), diffuse glomerular fibrosis (DGF, n = 2), ATI and TIN, in isolation or combined with other pathologies. The median follow-up time was 16.5 (0.5 ~ 68.0) months. Three patients died of recurrent malignancy and/or severe infection, one child developed to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), six patients (24%) had elevated serum creatinine (SCr > 100micromol/l) and nine patients (36%) still had proteinuria.

The data show that, unlike patients with Fanconi anemia (FA), the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) reservoir of patients with DBA was not significantly reduced, suggesting that collection of these cells should not constitute a remarkable restriction for DBA gene therapy. Subsequently, 2 clinically applicable lentiviral vectors were developed. In the former lentiviral vector, PGK.CoRPS19 LV, a codon-optimized version of RPS19 was driven by the phosphoglycerate kinase promoter (PGK) already used in different gene therapy trials, including FA gene therapy. In the latter one, EF1alpha.CoRPS19 LV, RPS19 expression was driven by the elongation factor alpha short promoter, EF1alpha(s). Preclinical experiments showed that transduction of DBA patient CD34+ cells with the PGK.CoRPS19 LV restored erythroid differentiation, and demonstrated the long-term repopulating properties of corrected DBA CD34+ cells, providing evidence of improved erythroid maturation. Concomitantly, long-term restoration of ribosomal biogenesis was verified using a potentially novel method applicable to patients' blood cells, based on ribosomal RNA methylation analyses. Finally, in vivo safety studies and proviral insertion site analyses showed that lentivirus-mediated gene therapy was nontoxic.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: A MASCC/ISOO Clinical Practice Statement (CPS) is aimed at generating a concise tool for clinicians that concentrates practical information needed for the management of oral complications of cancer patients. This CPS is focused on the risk of secondary oral cancer following hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). METHODS: This CPS was developed based on critical evaluation of the literature followed by a structured discussion of a group of leading experts, members of the Oral Care Study Group of MASCC/ISOO. The information is presented in the form of succinct bullets to generate a short manual about the best standard of care. RESULTS: Studies described a 7-16-fold higher risk of secondary oral cancer (mainly squamous cell carcinoma) in allogeneic HCT (alloHCT) recipients, particularly in those who developed chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD). Risk increases over time and is influenced by several risk factors. In autologous HCT, oral cancer risk seemed only slightly elevated. CONCLUSION: Clinicians should be aware of the higher oral cancer risk in alloHCT survivors, and emphasize the importance of lifelong oral cancer surveillance (at least every 6-12 months) and avoiding cancer promoting lifestyle factors in an empathic way, particularly of those with (a history of) cGVHD. Post-HCT for Fanconi anemia or dyskeratosis congenita, education and rigorous follow-up is even more crucial. In case of suspected oral lesions in the presence of oral mucosal cGVHD, a GVHD intervention may facilitate diagnosis. Suspected lesions should be biopsied. More research is needed on the role of HPV in oral cancer post-HCT.",

                    "abstract": "Fanconi anemia is the most common inherited bone marrow failure syndrome, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative option. Post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) is challenging in this group of children, given their increased sensitivity to chemotherapy. We performed a retrospective analysis of the data on children diagnosed with Fanconi anemia who underwent a haploidentical HSCT with PTCy from January 2014 to December 2019. Nineteen children (male/female, 0.75:1) underwent 21 haplo-HSCTs with PTCy. Fludarabine, low-dose cyclophosphamide, and 200 centi-gray total body irradiation were included in the conditioning regimen with 25 mg/kg PTCy on days +3 and +4. Haplo-graft was from a sibling in 38% and father in 57% of transplants. The source of stem cells was peripheral blood stem cells in 81% and bone marrow in 19% of transplants, with a median CD34 dose of 5.0 x 106/kg. We documented engraftment in 84% and primary graft failure in 10% of transplants. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) was infused concomitantly during cyclophosphamide in 13 children. Grade 2 and 3 mucositis was lower among those who received NAC as compared to those who did not (30% and 15% versus 33% and 50%), while transaminitis was higher among those who did not receive the infusion. The incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was 68%, and 81% of these were steroid responsive (grade I/II). We documented chronic GVHD in 25% children, predominantly involving the skin and mouth, which responded to low-dose steroids and ruxolitinib. Serum ferritin was monitored twice weekly as a surrogate marker for cytokine release syndrome due to nonavailability of IL-6 levels. A 1- or 2-log increase in the titers of ferritin associated with clinical features guided the early addition of steroids in the periengraftment period. The mean survival was found to be less among those with high serum ferritin (>10,000 ng/dL) in the periengraftment period as compared to those with ferritin <10,000 ng/dL (mean survival of 25 +- 10 months versus 50 +- 6 months, respectively). The overall survival in our cohort was 68.4%, with a mean survival time of 41.5 months (95% confidence interval, 29.3 to 53.8 months), with a statistically significant correlation between inferior outcome and having received over 15 transfusions before HSCT (P = .01). PTCy can be considered a viable option in children with Fanconi anemia, particularly in resource-limited settings given the high costs of HSCTs. Focused interventions in this subset of children help improve survival outcomes. Early identification of cytokine release syndrome and risk-adapted steroid therapy during engraftment helps prevent mortality. The concomitant use of NAC during cyclophosphamide infusion helps reduce oxygen free radical related tissue damage and regimen-related toxicity.",

                    "abstract": "Background: Fanconi anemia is the most common inherited bone marrow failure syndrome. HSCT remains the only curative treatment for hematological manifestations of FA. Despite restoration of long-term hematopoiesis, patients continue to remain at risk of late effects. Objectives: In our study, we aimed to reveal the problems that occur in the long-term follow-up of FA patients, and point out an ongoing need for the improvement of long-term follow-up guidelines for childhood transplant survivors with FA. Study Design: In this single centered, cross-sectional study, we analyzed the long-term outcome of 36 patients with FA according to current recommendations with a median age of 18.1 years (range: 6.1-36 years, male/female, 24/12) who underwent a HSCT at Pediatric Bone Marrow Transplantation (BMT) Unit between 1995 and 2019 and survived at least one year post-transplant. Results: The median long-term follow-up time was 8 years (range, 1-25 years). Gonadal dysfunction was detected in about 35% of our patients. 31% of the patients had hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, 4 % had hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. When the patients were evaluated for growth impairment, 7 of 12 patients who reached their final adult height and 12 of 21 patients who didn't complete their growth, had height standard deviation score below -2 SD. Three patients (9%) developed subclinical hypothyroidism, two (6%) had overt hypothyroidism and one (3%) had central hypothyroidism. Although, none of our patients fully met the criteria for metabolic syndrome, 23% of the patients had insulin resistance and 39% had dyslipidemia. Evaluation of organ dysfunctions revealed that almost 50% of the patients had obstructive and 21 % had restrictive changes in their pulmonary function tests. Hepatosteatosis was detected in 15% of the patients and mild valve dysfunction was detected in 50 % of evaluable patients. Three patients developed secondary malignancies. Squamous cell cancer developed in 2 patients and basal cell cancer in one patient. Conclusion: A risk-defined multidisciplinary approach for long-term follow up of children with FA undergoing HSCT is essential for early detection and management of late effects.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The patient database from the Bone Marrow Transplant Center of Pescara was reviewed to enroll FA patients. Patients', donors', HCT's, and screening's data were collected as well to look for the incidence and the treatment of TC. RESULTS: Twelve patients affected by FA were identified. Three patients died for transplant-related causes. Five of nine surviving patients were diagnosed with TC at a median of 21.7 years since transplantation and at a median age of 32.10 years. Interestingly, no patient manifested graft-versus-host-disease (GvHD). The 28-year cumulative incidence function of TC was 46.9% (95% CI, 36.9-56.9%). Two patients were treated with chemotherapy alone, two patients were treated with surgery alone, and one with surgery followed by chemotherapy. Overall, 4 patients with TC showed a clinical course characterized by a marked aggressiveness of the tumor disease which led to death due to cancer progression between 2 and 13 months. One patient is surviving 8 months after diagnosis of TC. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms the high incidence of tumors and in particular tongue tumors in allotransplanted FA patients. A careful screening has to be life-long maintained. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Considering the rarity of FA and the frailty of FA patients, this study may add important information for the cancer management of these patients.",

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of patients with Fanconi Anemia from a quaternary referral center between 2007-2021 was completed for head and neck cancer risk. RESULTS: One hundred and five FA patients were reviewed. Average age at presentation was 11.3 years old and 90.5% of patients underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). A total of 8.6% of patients had leukoplakia or erythroplakia and 3.8% developed malignancy. The standardized incidence ratio of head and neck malignancy was 483.8. Patients presented with leukoplakia and malignancy at an average age of 14.6 and 25.1 years old, respectively. Malignancies were aggressive and marked by recurrence. There were no premalignant or malignant lesions found on flexible laryngoscopy. This series represents the largest longitudinal series of pediatric FA head and neck lesions.

                    "abstract": "Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) can cure blood dyscrasias and reduce the risk of hematologic cancers in patients with inherited bone marrow failure syndromes (IBMFS). However, because of its high mortality rate, HCT is generally reserved until patients with IBMFS manifest life-threatening cytopenias or myeloid malignancy, at which point outcomes are poor. Screening tests that accurately predict transformation and enable timely intervention are lacking. These unknowns and risks limit the use of HCT in patients with IBMFS, sometimes until significant disease-related sequelae have occurred. A major goal for IBMFS is to reduce cellular therapy-related complications to the point that earlier intervention can be considered before significant transfusion exposure, occurrence of comorbidities, or malignant transformation. In recent decades, disease-specific allogeneic HCT trials have yielded significant improvements in outcomes in IBMFS conditions, including Fanconi anemia and dyskeratosis congenita. This is in large part due to marked reductions in conditioning intensity to address the increased sensitivity of these patients to cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation. The success of these approaches may also indicate an ability to leverage intrinsic fitness defects of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells across IBMFS disorders. Now with advances in tracking somatic genetic evolution in hematopoiesis and tailored minimal intensity conditioning regimens, this question arises: is it time for preventative HCT for IBMFS?",

                    "abstract": "The advent of new technologies has made it possible to identify genetic predispositions to myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute leukemias (AL) more frequently. The most frequent and best characterized at present are mutations in CEBPA, RUNX1, GATA2, ETV6 and DDX41 and, either in the presence of one of these mutations with a high allelic frequency, or in the case of a personal or family history suggestive of blood abnormalities such as non-immune thrombocytopenia, it is recommended to look for the possibility of a hereditary hematological malignancy (HHM). Indeed, early recognition of these HHMs allows better adaptation of the management of patients and their relatives, as allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is very often proposed for these pathologies. According to current data, with the exception of the GATA2 mutation, the constitutional or somatic nature of the mutations does not seem to influence the prognosis of hematological diseases. Therefore, the indication for an allograft will be determined according to the usual criteria. However, when searching for a family donor, it is important to ensure that there is no hereditary disease in the donor. In order to guarantee the possibility of performing the HSC allograft within a short period of time, it may be necessary to initiate a parallel procedure to find an unrelated donor. Given the limited information on the modalities of HSC transplantation in this setting, it is important to assess the benefit/risk of the disease and the procedure to decide on the type of conditioning (myeloablative or reduced intensity). In view of the limited experience with the risk of secondary cancers in the medium and long-term, it may be appropriate to recommend reduced intensity conditioning, as in the case of better characterized syndromic hematological diseases such as Fanconi anemia or telomere diseases. In summary, it seems important to evoke HHM more frequently, particularly in the presence of a family history, certain mutations or persistent blood abnormalities, in order to discuss the specific modalities of HSC allografting, particularly with regard to the search for a donor and the evaluation of certain modalities of the procedure, such as conditioning. It should be noted that the discovery of HHM, especially if the indication of an allogeneic HSC transplant is retained, will raise ethical and psychological considerations not only for the patient, but also for his family. A multidisciplinary approach involving molecular biologists, geneticists, hematologists and psychologists is essential.",

GR risk factors are well published, but there are no reliable biomarkers or therapies known. Fever is the most common symptom of GR, but no study has evaluated fever kinetics as a diagnostic marker of GR. The objectives of this study were to identify mechanisms, biomarkers, and potential therapies for GR after HCT. Chemokine ligand 9 (CXCL9), B-cell activating factor (BAFF), and complement markers (sC5b-9, C3a, and C5a) were measured in 7 patients with GR and compared with 15 HCT controls. All patients had a diagnosis of aplastic anemia, Fanconi anemia, or genetically undefined chromosomal fragility syndrome. All patients with GR were febrile during GR; therefore, control patients who underwent HCT were matched for diagnosis and early fevers after HCT. Patients withh GR had significantly higher CXCL9, BAFF, and sC5b-9 at the time of fever and GR compared with control patients who underwent HCT at the time of fever. The maximum fever was significantly higher and occurred significantly later in the transplant course in patients with GR compared with febrile HCT controls. These data support the use of CXCL9, BAFF, sC5b-9, and fever kinetics as GR markers. Two patients with GR underwent a second HCT that was complicated by high fevers. Both patients received interferon and complement blockers during their second HCT, and both preserved their graft. These laboratory and clinical findings support larger studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of interferon, complement, and BAFF inhibitors for the prevention and treatment of GR after HCT.",

                    "abstract": "The study aimed to investigate the fanconi anemia (FA)-related and stemness-related genes in lung cancer (LC) patients. Firstly, we identified stemness-related genes through weighted gene co-expression network analysis combined with TCGA database. Further combined stemness-related genes with FA-related genes to screen for prognostic-related genes. Risk score was constructed from the screened genes and comprehensive bioinformatics analyses were performed. Finally, single-cell data and in vitro experiment were used to validate our results. We screened a total of eight genes to construct a risk score. The risk score was an independent prognostic factor for LC. The validation results of multiple GEO databases were consistent with our results. Functional and pathway enrichment analysis showed that risk score was associated with cell cycle, DNA replication, DNA damage repair, and immune-related pathways. The results showed to be related to the stem cell self-renewal and proliferation. Besides, we also found that patients with higher risk scores had lower immune activity and function, and the effectiveness of immunotherapy might be poorer, with a higher rate of immune escape. Finally, our results revealed that SLC2A1 had the highest correlation with B cells in single-cell data analysis, and we validated its correlation with B cells and its expression with FA-related genes, tumor invasiveness, stemness, and drug sensitivity. Our research constructed a risk score based on FA-related and tumor stemness-related specific genes. In addition to accurately predicting the prognosis of patients with LC, the risk score may also serve as an innovative and viable predictor of immunotherapy response.",

The condition is caused by mutations in genes responsible for DNA repair. People with FA have an increased risk of developing tumors due to DNA damage. Flat-cell carcinomas of the head, neck, esophagus, and genital organs are often observed in individuals with FA. CASE REPORT A 31-year-old man with Fanconi anemia and a history of bone marrow transplantation was admitted to the General Surgery Department due to elevated levels of the CEA marker. Before the transplantation, chromosomal anomalies, bone marrow hypoplasia, kidney agenesis, and bone defects were noted. After the transplantation, he developed a skin rash. He was also diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the lip and chronic conditions, including cholestatic liver damage, hypertension, and hypothyroidism. During the diagnostic process, computed tomography showed signs of Barrett's esophagus, numerous polyps in the stomach and intestines, and a nodular formation measuring 4.5x5x5.5 cm in the right iliac region. Laparoscopy revealed a neoplasm of the appendix with numerous metastases on the inner abdominal wall and omentum. Histological analysis confirmed mucinous appendiceal cancer. The patient was discharged for palliative treatment at the Oncology Center with a final diagnosis of appendiceal cancer, mucinous type, grade G3. This case underscores the importance of early and comprehensive cancer screening in individuals with FA, particularly those with a history of bone marrow transplantation.

The cumulative incidences (CI) of neutrophil and platelet engraftment were 84% and 76% respectively, while that of primary and secondary graft failure was 10% and 8% respectively. The 100-day CI of acute GvHD grade III-IV(95% CI) was 13%, while the 24-month CI of extensive chronic GvHD was 4%. After a median follow-up of 43.4 months, the 2-year overall survival(OS) and GvHD/Rejection-free Survival (GRFS) probabilities are 67% and 53%, respectively. The TCR CD3+ alphabeta+ /CD19+ depletion group showed a significantly lower incidence of both acute and chronic GvHD and higher OS (79%; p0.013) and GRFS (71%; p < .001), while no significant differences in outcomes have been observed by different diagnosis and conditioning regimens. This large retrospective study supports the safety and feasibility of haplo-SCT in I-BMF patients. TCRalphabeta+ /CD19+ depletion offers higher chances of patients' survival, with a significantly lower risk of severe a- and c-GvHD in I-BMFs compared to other platforms.",

                    "abstract": "Fanconi anemia is the most common inherited bone marrow failure syndrome, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative option. Post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) is challenging in this group of children, given their increased sensitivity to chemotherapy. We performed a retrospective analysis of the data on children diagnosed with Fanconi anemia who underwent a haploidentical HSCT with PTCy from January 2014 to December 2019. Nineteen children (male/female, 0.75:1) underwent 21 haplo-HSCTs with PTCy. Fludarabine, low-dose cyclophosphamide, and 200 centi-gray total body irradiation were included in the conditioning regimen with 25 mg/kg PTCy on days +3 and +4. Haplo-graft was from a sibling in 38% and father in 57% of transplants. The source of stem cells was peripheral blood stem cells in 81% and bone marrow in 19% of transplants, with a median CD34 dose of 5.0 x 106/kg. We documented engraftment in 84% and primary graft failure in 10% of transplants. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) was infused concomitantly during cyclophosphamide in 13 children. Grade 2 and 3 mucositis was lower among those who received NAC as compared to those who did not (30% and 15% versus 33% and 50%), while transaminitis was higher among those who did not receive the infusion. The incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was 68%, and 81% of these were steroid responsive (grade I/II). We documented chronic GVHD in 25% children, predominantly involving the skin and mouth, which responded to low-dose steroids and ruxolitinib. Serum ferritin was monitored twice weekly as a surrogate marker for cytokine release syndrome due to nonavailability of IL-6 levels. A 1- or 2-log increase in the titers of ferritin associated with clinical features guided the early addition of steroids in the periengraftment period. The mean survival was found to be less among those with high serum ferritin (>10,000 ng/dL) in the periengraftment period as compared to those with ferritin <10,000 ng/dL (mean survival of 25 +- 10 months versus 50 +- 6 months, respectively). The overall survival in our cohort was 68.4%, with a mean survival time of 41.5 months (95% confidence interval, 29.3 to 53.8 months), with a statistically significant correlation between inferior outcome and having received over 15 transfusions before HSCT (P = .01). PTCy can be considered a viable option in children with Fanconi anemia, particularly in resource-limited settings given the high costs of HSCTs. Focused interventions in this subset of children help improve survival outcomes. Early identification of cytokine release syndrome and risk-adapted steroid therapy during engraftment helps prevent mortality. The concomitant use of NAC during cyclophosphamide infusion helps reduce oxygen free radical related tissue damage and regimen-related toxicity.",

METHODS: According to the inclusion criteria, we selected 395 DNA samples from NSCLC patients for genotyping and combined with clinical data for Cox regression analysis and stratification analyses to assess relationships between overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) with SNPs genotypes. RESULTS: The results revealed that patients with FANCE rs6907678 TT genotype have a longer OS than TC and CC genotype (Additive model: P = 0.004, HR = 1.696, 95% CI = 1.186-2.425). In stratification analyses, Longer PFS is found in female, age <= 55 years old and non-smoking patients with FANCE rs6907678 TT genotype, and patients with TT genotypes were significantly had longer OS in male, age >55 years old, non-smoking, squamous cell carcinoma and stage IV stratification. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrates that patients with FANCE rs6907678 TT genotype are contributed to better prognosis. FANCE rs6907678 may be used as a clinical biomarker for predicting the prognosis of NSCLC patients with platinum-based chemotherapy.",

Patients diagnosed with FA are more predisposed to develop oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and this risk increases in transplant patients. The clinical characteristics of the oral manifestations of SCC in this group of patients do not differ from the lesions present in patients without the disease; however, they can be diagnosed in young patients and less common locations, such as, for example, in the buccal mucosa. OBJECTIVE: To report a case series of patients diagnosed with FA with oral SCC. METHOD: Included in this case series are six patients diagnosed with SCC in the buccal mucosa with similar clinical characteristics. FINAL CONSIDERATIONS: There are still difficulties in establishing the natural history of oral lesions in patients with FA. Thus, disclosing a series of cases with similar changes may be relevant to improving and refining the multidisciplinary team's clinical view of suspected SCC or oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMD), providing surveillance and timely management.",

The ex vivo approach for gene addition or editing of HSCs, however, is complex, invasive, technically challenging, costly and not free of toxicity. In vivo gene addition or editing promise to transform gene therapy from a highly sophisticated strategy to a \"user-friendly' approach to eventually become a broadly available, highly accessible and potentially affordable treatment modality.

Most of the non-TBI conditioning regimens use an ex vivo T-cell depletion approach, but this is not feasible at all pediatric stem cell transplant programs. To evaluate the success of HSCT in patients with FA using non-TBI conditioning regimens with in vivo T-cell depletion approach. HSCT using non-TBI based conditioning was performed on two siblings with FA.

The second sibling underwent MSD transplant with UCB and BM grafts using similar approach, but without busulfan and mycophenolate.

For FA, we prefer haplo-SCT by T-cell receptor alphabetaT-cell and B-cell depletion (alphabetaT/B-depleted haplo-SCT), which can reduce the risks of PT-CY-related complications and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). An 11-year-old boy with diagnosed FA (FANCG mutation) and bone marrow failure was to receive alphabetaT/B-depleted haplo-SCT from his father (HLA 4/8 allele matched) due to absence of an HLA-matched donors. alphabetaT/B-depleted peripheral blood stem cells (CD34 + cell count, 1.17 x 107/kg; alphabeta + T-cell count, 1.3 x 105/kg) were infused following conditioning consisting of fludarabine (150 mg/m2), cyclophosphamide (40 mg/kg), anti-thymocyte globulin (5 mg/kg), rituximab (375 mg/m2), and thoraco-abdominal irradiation (3 Gy). Tacrolimus was used for GVHD prophylaxis until day + 30. Neutrophil engraftment was achieved on day + 9, and complete chimerism was confirmed on days + 28 and + 96. At 12-month post-SCT, the patient was well without GVHD or any other complications. alphabetaT/B-depleted haplo-SCT is a good choice not only for patients unsuitable for PT-CY, but also for all pediatric recipients to reduce SCT-related complications.",

Eighty-nine patients, 70 with bone marrow failure +/- cytogenetic abnormalities, 19 with MDS/AML, were included. Five-year overall survival (OS) was 83.2% and event-free survival (EFS) was 74%. Age >=19, HLA mismatch and year of HCT were multivariable predictors (MVPs) for OS, EFS and treatment-related mortality (TRM). In the pediatric group, TCD was a borderline MVP (P = 0.059) with 5-year OS of 73.0% in TCD vs. 100% for T-replete HCT. The cumulative incidence of day 100 grade II-IV aGvHD and 5-year cGvHD were 5.6% and 4.6%, respectively. Relapse in the MDS/AML subgroup occurred in 4 patients (16%). Graft failure was seen in 9 patients (TCD 6/37 [16%]; T-replete 3/52 [5.7%]). Six patients developed malignancy after HCT. Survival chances after HCT for FA are excellent and associated with high engrafted survival and low toxicity. Age >=19, HLA mismatch, year of transplant and 'TCD in the <19 years group' (although borderline) were found to be negative predictors for survival.",

                    "abstract": "Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare and complex genetic disorder, clinically characterized by bone marrow failure, congenital defects, and cancer predisposition. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) represents the only therapeutic option to restore normal hematopoiesis after the occurrence of marrow failure or clonal hematopoietic abnormality. However, radiation exposure during transplant may increase the risk of later malignancies. In this retrospective study, we analyzed the results of HSCT with a radiation-free, busulfan-based conditioning regimen in FA patients. A total of 122 patients (median age: 8 years, range: 2-18 years) with FA who underwent HSCT between January 2008 and January 2020 were enrolled in this study and followed up to the end of 2020. The preparative regimen included busulfan (0.2 mg/kg/day, days -9 to -6), cyclophosphamide (15 mg/kg/day, days -5 to -2), and in vivo T-cell depletion with rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin. All patients received graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis with cyclosporine combined with methotrexate. We used the Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test, and Cox proportional hazards models to analyze patient survival. Peripheral blood, bone marrow and cord blood hematopoietic stem cells were used in 84 (68.9%), 31 (25.4%) and 7 (5.7%) patients, respectively. Donors were matched siblings in 48 (39.3%), matched other relatives in 56 (45.9%), and matched unrelated persons in 18 (14.8%) patients. With a median follow-up time of 24.25 months, graft rejection occurred in only one patient. The 1- and 5-year overall survival rates were 84.14% (95% confidence interval: 76.02-89.70) and 82.16% (95% confidence interval: 73.01-88.45), respectively. Of the patient characteristics documented before transplant, the presence of cardiopulmonary, genitourinary tract, central nervous system, and limb malformations significantly affected survival rates. Our results indicate excellent outcomes in patients with FA undergoing HSCT with a radiation-free, busulfan-based conditioning regimen. It would be desirable to aim at optimizing the outcome of HSCT in FA patients in future studies.",

Impaired DNA repair including mutations in Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway genes are responsible for progression of many cancers. Nevertheless, FA-pathways genes have never been reported in myeloid cancers. Hence, this study was aimed to discover DNA repair genes associated with CML progression. AP-CML patients were subjected to whole exome sequencing along with appropriate controls. A novel splice site FANCD2 mutation was detected. FANCD2 is a well-known FA-pathway gene with established role in DNA repair. This is first report of FA-pathway DNA repair genes in myeloid cancers that can serve as a novel marker of CML progression to clinically intervene CML progression. Further studies are needed to establish the functional role of FANCD2 in CML progression that can provide novel insights into CML pathogenesis. This study also indicates that a combination TKIs and Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors like Olaparib (FDA approved anti-cancer drug for FA-pathway gene mutations) could improve the clinical outcome CML patients in accelerated and blast-crisis phases of the disease.",

Patients diagnosed with FA are more predisposed to develop oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and this risk increases in transplant patients. The clinical characteristics of the oral manifestations of SCC in this group of patients do not differ from the lesions present in patients without the disease; however, they can be diagnosed in young patients and less common locations, such as, for example, in the buccal mucosa. OBJECTIVE: To report a case series of patients diagnosed with FA with oral SCC. METHOD: Included in this case series are six patients diagnosed with SCC in the buccal mucosa with similar clinical characteristics. FINAL CONSIDERATIONS: There are still difficulties in establishing the natural history of oral lesions in patients with FA. Thus, disclosing a series of cases with similar changes may be relevant to improving and refining the multidisciplinary team's clinical view of suspected SCC or oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMD), providing surveillance and timely management.",

We report the outcome of 34 patients with FA inside a collaborative multicenter national study based on recommendations of Spanish Working Group for Bone Marrow Transplantation in Children (GETMON) between 2009 and 2016. Fludarabine-based conditioning regimen was carried out in all patients, with low dose total body irradiation in unrelated transplants. Disease status before HSCT was bone marrow failure (BMF) in 30 patients and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in four. Donors were matched siblings donors (MSD) in 18, matched unrelated donors (MUD) in 15, and one haploidentical donor. All except one patient engrafted. Cumulative incidence of grades II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was 29% and 11% for chronic GVHD. Median follow-up after HSCT was 6.5 years. Seven patients (21%) died due to transplant-related causes, two (6%) because of MDS relapse, and one (3%) after a squamous cell carcinoma. Overall survival (OS) was 73% at 5 years post-transplant, with no differences between MSD and MUD transplants. OS for patients with BMF was 80% while for MDS was 25%. Our data suggest HSCT can cure hematologic manifestations of most FA patients with BMF.",

The data show that, unlike patients with Fanconi anemia (FA), the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) reservoir of patients with DBA was not significantly reduced, suggesting that collection of these cells should not constitute a remarkable restriction for DBA gene therapy. Subsequently, 2 clinically applicable lentiviral vectors were developed. In the former lentiviral vector, PGK.CoRPS19 LV, a codon-optimized version of RPS19 was driven by the phosphoglycerate kinase promoter (PGK) already used in different gene therapy trials, including FA gene therapy. In the latter one, EF1alpha.CoRPS19 LV, RPS19 expression was driven by the elongation factor alpha short promoter, EF1alpha(s). Preclinical experiments showed that transduction of DBA patient CD34+ cells with the PGK.CoRPS19 LV restored erythroid differentiation, and demonstrated the long-term repopulating properties of corrected DBA CD34+ cells, providing evidence of improved erythroid maturation. Concomitantly, long-term restoration of ribosomal biogenesis was verified using a potentially novel method applicable to patients' blood cells, based on ribosomal RNA methylation analyses. Finally, in vivo safety studies and proviral insertion site analyses showed that lentivirus-mediated gene therapy was nontoxic.",

                    "abstract": "Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) can cure blood dyscrasias and reduce the risk of hematologic cancers in patients with inherited bone marrow failure syndromes (IBMFS). However, because of its high mortality rate, HCT is generally reserved until patients with IBMFS manifest life-threatening cytopenias or myeloid malignancy, at which point outcomes are poor. Screening tests that accurately predict transformation and enable timely intervention are lacking. These unknowns and risks limit the use of HCT in patients with IBMFS, sometimes until significant disease-related sequelae have occurred. A major goal for IBMFS is to reduce cellular therapy-related complications to the point that earlier intervention can be considered before significant transfusion exposure, occurrence of comorbidities, or malignant transformation. In recent decades, disease-specific allogeneic HCT trials have yielded significant improvements in outcomes in IBMFS conditions, including Fanconi anemia and dyskeratosis congenita. This is in large part due to marked reductions in conditioning intensity to address the increased sensitivity of these patients to cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation. The success of these approaches may also indicate an ability to leverage intrinsic fitness defects of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells across IBMFS disorders. Now with advances in tracking somatic genetic evolution in hematopoiesis and tailored minimal intensity conditioning regimens, this question arises: is it time for preventative HCT for IBMFS?",

Because of the systemic nature of these diseases, transplant strategies are modified to decrease immediate and late toxicities. HCT from HLA-matched related or unrelated donors offers excellent survival for young patients in aplasia.

As genetic aberrations are the main causes of all forms of hereditary anemia, the optimal approach involves repairing the defective gene, possibly through the transplantation of normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from a normal matching donor or through gene therapy approaches (either in vivo or ex vivo) to correct the patient's HSCs. To clearly illustrate the importance of cell and gene therapy in hereditary anemia, this paper provides a review of the genetic aberration, epidemiology, clinical features, current management, and cell and gene therapy endeavors related to SCD, thalassemia, Fanconi anemia, and G6PDD. Moreover, we expound the future research direction of HSC derivation from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), strategies to edit HSCs, gene therapy risk mitigation, and their clinical perspectives. In conclusion, gene-corrected hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has promising outcomes for SCD, Fanconi anemia, and thalassemia, and it may overcome the limitation of the source of allogenic bone marrow transplantation.",

We tested the ability of the DDIR assay to predict response to oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in colorectal cancer and characterized the biology in DDIR-positive colorectal cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Samples and clinical data were assessed according to DDIR status from patients who received either 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or 5FUFA (bolus and infusion 5-FU with folinic acid) plus oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) within the FOCUS trial (n = 361, stage IV), or neoadjuvant FOLFOX in the FOxTROT trial (n = 97, stage II/III). Whole transcriptome, mutation, and IHC data of these samples were used to interrogate the biology of DDIR in colorectal cancer. RESULTS: Contrary to our hypothesis, DDIR-negative patients displayed a trend toward improved outcome for oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy compared with DDIR-positive patients. DDIR positivity was associated with microsatellite instability (MSI) and colorectal molecular subtype 1. Refinement of the DDIR signature, based on overlapping IFN-related chemokine signaling associated with DDIR positivity across colorectal cancer and breast cancer cohorts, further confirmed that the DDIR assay did not have predictive value for oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in colorectal cancer. CONCLUSIONS: DDIR positivity does not predict improved response following oxaliplatin treatment in colorectal cancer. However, data presented here suggest the potential of the DDIR assay in identifying immune-rich tumors that may benefit from immune checkpoint blockade, beyond current use of MSI status.",

                    "abstract": "Inherited bone marrow failure syndromes (IBMFS) encompass a group of rare genetic disorders characterized by bone marrow failure, non-hematologic multisystemic comorbidities, disease defining congenital anomalies, and a susceptibility to myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myeloid leukemia, and in some instances solid tumors. The most common IBMFS include Fanconi anemia, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, Diamond-Blackfan anemia, and telomere biology disorders/ dyskeratosis congenita. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) is a well-established curative treatment to correct the hematological manifestations but does not halt or reverse the nonhematological complications and may hasten them. With advances in HCT and in our ability to care for patients with IBMFS, an increasing number of survivors are making it imperative to not only diagnose but also treat late effects from the pre-, peri-, and post-HCT course and complications relating to the natural history of the syndrome. As the field of HCT evolves to allow for the incorporation of alternate graft sources, for expansion of donor options to include unrelated and mismatched donors, and for use of reduced-intensity conditioning or reduced toxicity myeloablative regimens, we have yet to determine if these advances modify the disease-specific course. While long-term outcomes of these patients are often included under one umbrella, this article seeks to address disease-specific post-HCT outcomes within IBMFS.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a critical condition characterized by a dysregulated immune response to infection, often resulting in organ dysfunction. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a key proinflammatory cytokine associated with sepsis and its complications. This case study explored the use of Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT) combined with Cytosorb in managing pediatric patients with leukemia, severe thrombocytopenia, and elevated IL-6 levels. CASE PRESENTATION: A 10-year-old boy with Fanconi anemia presented with pancytopenia, fever, and necrotic lesions, indicative of mucormycosis. Following the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the patient experienced severe complications, including septic shock. Despite appropriate treatment, inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), and IL-6, were significantly elevated. CRRT with Cytosorb was initiated to manage hypercytokinemia and improve the patient's clinical status. INTERVENTION: The CRRT procedure utilizes citrate as an anticoagulant because of severe thrombocytopenia. The treatment lasted for 20 h, during which the inflammatory biomarkers were monitored. The post-treatment results indicated a significant reduction in IL-6 levels within 24 h and a decrease in PCT levels at 8 h. CRP levels gradually declined over 40 h. OUTCOME: The patient exhibited marked clinical improvement, with significant healing of cutaneous lesions and stabilization of inflammatory markers, allowing transfer to the ward for continued chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: This case suggests that CRRT combined with cytosorb may be a valuable adjunctive therapy for managing complex cases of septic shock. The observed reduction in inflammatory markers, particularly IL-6, warrants further investigation. Concurrent antimicrobial, antifungal, and dexamethasone treatments for IRIS may have influenced the observed outcomes in this single case.

                    "abstract": "Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) can cure blood dyscrasias and reduce the risk of hematologic cancers in patients with inherited bone marrow failure syndromes (IBMFS). However, because of its high mortality rate, HCT is generally reserved until patients with IBMFS manifest life-threatening cytopenias or myeloid malignancy, at which point outcomes are poor. Screening tests that accurately predict transformation and enable timely intervention are lacking. These unknowns and risks limit the use of HCT in patients with IBMFS, sometimes until significant disease-related sequelae have occurred. A major goal for IBMFS is to reduce cellular therapy-related complications to the point that earlier intervention can be considered before significant transfusion exposure, occurrence of comorbidities, or malignant transformation. In recent decades, disease-specific allogeneic HCT trials have yielded significant improvements in outcomes in IBMFS conditions, including Fanconi anemia and dyskeratosis congenita. This is in large part due to marked reductions in conditioning intensity to address the increased sensitivity of these patients to cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation. The success of these approaches may also indicate an ability to leverage intrinsic fitness defects of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells across IBMFS disorders. Now with advances in tracking somatic genetic evolution in hematopoiesis and tailored minimal intensity conditioning regimens, this question arises: is it time for preventative HCT for IBMFS?",

The FANCA gene is the most commonly pathogenic gene, accounting for more than 60% of all causative genes. PATIENT CONCERNS: The clinical case is a 3-year-old boy showed mild anemia and scattered bleeding spots the size of a needle tip all over his body. DIAGNOSES: Compound heterozygous mutation was identified in the FANCA gene in the FA case: c.1A > T from the father in exon 1; the deletion of chr16: 89857810-89858476 (exon13-14 del) from the mother; finally, the patient was diagnosed as Fanconi anemia. INTERVENTION: After diagnosis, the child received chemotherapy (Ara-C + Flu + Cy + ATG). Then, the hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and unrelated umbilical cord blood transfusion were performed. OUTCOMES: The child is recovering well and is in regular follow-up. CONCLUSION AND LESSONS: The discovery of new mutations in the FANCA gene enriches the genetic profile of FA and helps clinicians to further understand this disease and guide genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) remains the only available curative treatment for Fanconi Anemia (FA), with particularly favorable outcomes reported after matched sibling donor (MSD) transplant. OBJECTIVES: To describe outcomes, with a special focus on late complications, in FA patients who underwent umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT). STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of allogeneic UCBT for FA performed between 1988 and 2021 in European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) affiliated centers. RESULTS: A total of 205 FA patients underwent UCBT (55 related and 150 unrelated) across 77 transplant centers. Indications for UCBT were bone marrow failure in 190 patients and acute leukemia/myelodysplasia in 15 patients. Median age at transplant was 9 (1.2-43) years, with only 20 patients over the age of 18. Among the donor-recipient pairs, 56% (n=116) had 0-1/6 HLA mismatch. Limited field radiotherapy was administered to 28% (n=58) and 78% (n=160) received a Fludarabine (FLU)-based conditioning regimen. Serotherapy consisted of anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG, n=159; 78%) or alemtuzumab (n=12; 6%). Median follow-up was 10 years for related and 7 years for unrelated UCBT. Excellent outcomes were observed in the setting of related UCBT, including a 60-day cumulative incidence (CI) of neutrophil recovery at 98.1% (93.9-100), a 100-day CI of grades II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) at 17.3% (9.5-31.6), and a 5-year CI of chronic GVHD at 22.7% (13.3-38.7; 13% extensive). Five-year overall survival (OS) was 88%. In multivariate analysis, none of the factors included in the model predicted a better OS. In unrelated UCBT, the 60-day CI of neutrophil recovery was 78.7% (71.9-86.3), the 100-day CI of grade II-IV aGVHD was 31.4% (24.6-40.2) and the 5-year CI of cGVHD was 24.3% (17.8-32.2) (12% extensive). Five-year OS was 44%. In multivariate analysis, negative recipient CMV serology, FLU-based conditioning, age at UCBT less than 9 years and 0-1/6 HLA mismatch were associated with improved OS. A total of 106 patients, including 5 AL/MDS, survived for over 2 years after UCBT. Nine of these patients developed subsequent neoplasms (SN), including one donor-derived AML and 8 solid tumors, at a median of 9.7 (2.3-21.8) years post-UCBT (one related and 8 unrelated UCBT). In a subset of 49 patients with available data, late non-malignant complications affecting various organ systems were observed at a median of 8.7 (2.7-28.8) years post-UCBT. CONCLUSION: UCB is a valid source of stem cells for transplantation in patients with FA, with best results observed after related UCBT. After unrelated UCBT, improved survival was observed in patients transplanted at a younger age, with FLU-based conditioning and better HLA parity. The incidence of organ specific complications and subsequent neoplasms was relatively low. Subsequent neoplasm incidence, mostly squamous cell carcinoma, increases with time. Rigorous follow-up and life-long screening is crucial in Fanconi anemia patients transplant survivors. The long-term complications observed emphasize the need for long-life screening of transplant survivors.",

In the present study, we report eight patients with rare diseases who underwent OTC in China's first and largest ovarian tissue cryobank. Procedure: Data from girls with rare diseases who underwent OTC between September 2020 and November 2022 were retrospectively analyzed. We also compared the number of cryopreserved cortex pieces, follicle number, and AMH in those with rare diseases and age-matched children with non-rare diseases who also underwent OTC in our cryobank. Results: The median age of the children was 5.88 +- 3.52 (range 2-13) years old. Unilateral oophorectomy was undertaken via laparoscopy in all of the children. The diseases in the 8 patients were: 4 mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS I two cases, IVA two cases), 1 Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA), 1 Fanconi anemia (FA), 1 hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome (HIES), 1 Niemann-Pick disease. The number of cryopreserved cortex pieces was 17.13 +- 6.36, and the follicle count per 2 mm biopsy was 447.38 +- 524.35. No significant difference in age, the count of cryopreserved cortex pieces, follicle number per 2 mm biopsy, and AMH level was seen between the 20 children with non-rare diseases and those with rare diseases. Conclusions: The reports help practitioners counsel girls with rare diseases about fertility preservation. The demand for OTC in pediatrics will likely grow as a standard of care.",

PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors upregulate T-cell killing of cancer cells and is a class of promising treatment for FA-AML. Here, we developed a novel FA-AML murine model that allows the study of human AML with a humanized immune system in order to investigate immunotherapeutic treatments in vivo. FA-AML1 cells and non-FA-mutated Kasumi-1 cells were injected into 8-10 week old NSG mice. Once leukemic engraftment was confirmed by HLA-DR expression in the peripheral blood, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMCs) were injected into the mice. One week post-hPBMCs injection, Nivolumab (PD-1 inhibitor) or PBS vehicle control was administered to the mice bi-weekly. In our Nivolumab treated mice, FA-AML1, but not Kasumi-1-engrafted mice, had significantly prolonged overall survival. Both FA-AML1 and Kasumi-1 engrafted mice had decreased spleen weights. Higher leukemic infiltration into vital organs was observed in FA-AML1 engrafted mice compared to Kasumi-1 engrafted mice. In conclusion, our novel humanized murine model of FA-mutated AML is an attractive tool for supporting further studies and clinical trials using PD-1 inhibitors to treat FA-mutated AML.",

                    "abstract": "Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare and complex genetic disorder, clinically characterized by bone marrow failure, congenital defects, and cancer predisposition. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) represents the only therapeutic option to restore normal hematopoiesis after the occurrence of marrow failure or clonal hematopoietic abnormality. However, radiation exposure during transplant may increase the risk of later malignancies. In this retrospective study, we analyzed the results of HSCT with a radiation-free, busulfan-based conditioning regimen in FA patients. A total of 122 patients (median age: 8 years, range: 2-18 years) with FA who underwent HSCT between January 2008 and January 2020 were enrolled in this study and followed up to the end of 2020. The preparative regimen included busulfan (0.2 mg/kg/day, days -9 to -6), cyclophosphamide (15 mg/kg/day, days -5 to -2), and in vivo T-cell depletion with rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin. All patients received graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis with cyclosporine combined with methotrexate. We used the Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test, and Cox proportional hazards models to analyze patient survival. Peripheral blood, bone marrow and cord blood hematopoietic stem cells were used in 84 (68.9%), 31 (25.4%) and 7 (5.7%) patients, respectively. Donors were matched siblings in 48 (39.3%), matched other relatives in 56 (45.9%), and matched unrelated persons in 18 (14.8%) patients. With a median follow-up time of 24.25 months, graft rejection occurred in only one patient. The 1- and 5-year overall survival rates were 84.14% (95% confidence interval: 76.02-89.70) and 82.16% (95% confidence interval: 73.01-88.45), respectively. Of the patient characteristics documented before transplant, the presence of cardiopulmonary, genitourinary tract, central nervous system, and limb malformations significantly affected survival rates. Our results indicate excellent outcomes in patients with FA undergoing HSCT with a radiation-free, busulfan-based conditioning regimen. It would be desirable to aim at optimizing the outcome of HSCT in FA patients in future studies.",

                    "abstract": "Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a curative treatment for patients with many different blood and immune diseases; however, current treatment regimens contain non-specific chemotherapy and/or irradiation conditioning, which carry both short-term and long-term toxicities. The use of such agents may be particularly harmful for patients with Fanconi anemia (FA), who have genetic mutations resulting in deficiencies in DNA repair, leading to increased sensitivity to genotoxic agents. mAb-based conditioning has been proposed as an alternative conditioning strategy for HSCT that minimizes these toxicities by eliminating collateral tissue damage. Given the high need for improved treatments for FA patients, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of different alphaCD117 mAb agents and immunosuppression on hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) depletion and explored their ability to safely establish therapeutic donor hematopoiesis post-HSCT in FA disease models. We evaluated the effects of different concentrations of alphaCD117 mAbs in vitro and in vivo on HSC growth and depletion. To further assess the efficacy of mAb-based conditioning, Fancd2-/- animals were treated with alphaCD117 mAb and combination agents with alphaCD47 mAb and antibody-drug-conjugates (ADCs) for syngeneic HSCT. Immunosuppression alphaCD4 mAb was added to all in vivo experiments due to a slightly mismatched background between the donor grafts and recipients. Immunosuppressant cocktails were also given to Fancd2-/- animals to evaluate the efficacy of mAb-based conditioning in the haploidentical setting. Statistical analyses were done using the unpaired t-test. We found that antagonistic alphaCD117 mAbs alone do not deplete host HSCs or enhance HSCT effectively in FA mouse models; however, the potency of alphaCD117 mAbs can be safely augmented through combination with alphaCD47 mAbs and with ADCs, both of which lead to profound HSC depletion and establishment of long-term donor engraftment post-syngeneic HSCT. This is the first time these approaches have been tested in parallel in any disease setting, with the greatest donor engraftment observed after CD117-ADC conditioning. Interestingly, our data also suggest that HSC-targeted conditioning is not necessary in HSCT for FA, as high donor HSC engraftment was observed with mAb-based immune suppression alone with immunologically matched and mismatched haploidentical grafts. These results demonstrate the safety and efficacy of several different non-genotoxic mAb-based conditioning strategies in the FA setting. In addition, they show that if sufficient immunosuppression is given to obtain initial donor HSC engraftment, turnover of a majority of the hematolymphoid system can result, likely owing to the survival advantage of wild-type HSCs over FA HSCs. Such non-toxic all-mAb-based conditioning strategies could be transformative for FA patients and those with other hematolymphoid diseases.",

However, the side effects of chemotherapy are severe because of the indiscriminate action of DNA-damaging agents on both healthy and cancerous cells. DNA repair pathway inhibition provides a less toxic and targeted alternative to chemotherapy. A compelling DNA repair target is the Fanconi anemia (FA) E3 ligase core complex due to its critical-and likely singular-role in the efficient removal of specific DNA lesions. FA pathway inactivation has been demonstrated to specifically kill some types of cancer cells without the addition of exogenous DNA damage, including cells that lack BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, or functionally related genes. In this perspective, we discuss the genetic and biochemical evidence in support of the FA core complex as a compelling drug target for cancer therapy. In particular, we discuss the genetic, biochemical, and structural data that could rapidly advance our capacity to identify and implement the use of FA core complex inhibitors in the clinic.",

                    "abstract": "Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a curative treatment for patients with many different blood and immune diseases; however, current treatment regimens contain non-specific chemotherapy and/or irradiation conditioning, which carry both short-term and long-term toxicities. The use of such agents may be particularly harmful for patients with Fanconi anemia (FA), who have genetic mutations resulting in deficiencies in DNA repair, leading to increased sensitivity to genotoxic agents. mAb-based conditioning has been proposed as an alternative conditioning strategy for HSCT that minimizes these toxicities by eliminating collateral tissue damage. Given the high need for improved treatments for FA patients, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of different alphaCD117 mAb agents and immunosuppression on hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) depletion and explored their ability to safely establish therapeutic donor hematopoiesis post-HSCT in FA disease models. We evaluated the effects of different concentrations of alphaCD117 mAbs in vitro and in vivo on HSC growth and depletion. To further assess the efficacy of mAb-based conditioning, Fancd2-/- animals were treated with alphaCD117 mAb and combination agents with alphaCD47 mAb and antibody-drug-conjugates (ADCs) for syngeneic HSCT. Immunosuppression alphaCD4 mAb was added to all in vivo experiments due to a slightly mismatched background between the donor grafts and recipients. Immunosuppressant cocktails were also given to Fancd2-/- animals to evaluate the efficacy of mAb-based conditioning in the haploidentical setting. Statistical analyses were done using the unpaired t-test. We found that antagonistic alphaCD117 mAbs alone do not deplete host HSCs or enhance HSCT effectively in FA mouse models; however, the potency of alphaCD117 mAbs can be safely augmented through combination with alphaCD47 mAbs and with ADCs, both of which lead to profound HSC depletion and establishment of long-term donor engraftment post-syngeneic HSCT. This is the first time these approaches have been tested in parallel in any disease setting, with the greatest donor engraftment observed after CD117-ADC conditioning. Interestingly, our data also suggest that HSC-targeted conditioning is not necessary in HSCT for FA, as high donor HSC engraftment was observed with mAb-based immune suppression alone with immunologically matched and mismatched haploidentical grafts. These results demonstrate the safety and efficacy of several different non-genotoxic mAb-based conditioning strategies in the FA setting. In addition, they show that if sufficient immunosuppression is given to obtain initial donor HSC engraftment, turnover of a majority of the hematolymphoid system can result, likely owing to the survival advantage of wild-type HSCs over FA HSCs. Such non-toxic all-mAb-based conditioning strategies could be transformative for FA patients and those with other hematolymphoid diseases.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a critical condition characterized by a dysregulated immune response to infection, often resulting in organ dysfunction. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a key proinflammatory cytokine associated with sepsis and its complications. This case study explored the use of Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT) combined with Cytosorb in managing pediatric patients with leukemia, severe thrombocytopenia, and elevated IL-6 levels. CASE PRESENTATION: A 10-year-old boy with Fanconi anemia presented with pancytopenia, fever, and necrotic lesions, indicative of mucormycosis. Following the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the patient experienced severe complications, including septic shock. Despite appropriate treatment, inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), and IL-6, were significantly elevated. CRRT with Cytosorb was initiated to manage hypercytokinemia and improve the patient's clinical status. INTERVENTION: The CRRT procedure utilizes citrate as an anticoagulant because of severe thrombocytopenia. The treatment lasted for 20 h, during which the inflammatory biomarkers were monitored. The post-treatment results indicated a significant reduction in IL-6 levels within 24 h and a decrease in PCT levels at 8 h. CRP levels gradually declined over 40 h. OUTCOME: The patient exhibited marked clinical improvement, with significant healing of cutaneous lesions and stabilization of inflammatory markers, allowing transfer to the ward for continued chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: This case suggests that CRRT combined with cytosorb may be a valuable adjunctive therapy for managing complex cases of septic shock. The observed reduction in inflammatory markers, particularly IL-6, warrants further investigation. Concurrent antimicrobial, antifungal, and dexamethasone treatments for IRIS may have influenced the observed outcomes in this single case. Controlled studies are needed to evaluate the specific contribution of Cytosorb-CRRT and assess its long-term efficacy and safety in similar patient populations, particularly in resource-limited settings.

Six patients developed head-and-neck SCC after transplantation. The cumulative incidence of SCC at 15 and 30 years from the HSCT was 14.2% and 71.2%, respectively. One patient was diagnosed in stage IV and the rest, who were being followed up in cancer screening programs, in stage I. Treatment of SCC consisted of surgery in all patients; radiotherapy and chemotherapy were used in two patients and were poorly tolerated. CONCLUSION: FA patients have high risk of head-and-neck SCC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The patient database from the Bone Marrow Transplant Center of Pescara was reviewed to enroll FA patients. Patients', donors', HCT's, and screening's data were collected as well to look for the incidence and the treatment of TC. RESULTS: Twelve patients affected by FA were identified. Three patients died for transplant-related causes. Five of nine surviving patients were diagnosed with TC at a median of 21.7 years since transplantation and at a median age of 32.10 years. Interestingly, no patient manifested graft-versus-host-disease (GvHD). The 28-year cumulative incidence function of TC was 46.9% (95% CI, 36.9-56.9%). Two patients were treated with chemotherapy alone, two patients were treated with surgery alone, and one with surgery followed by chemotherapy. Overall, 4 patients with TC showed a clinical course characterized by a marked aggressiveness of the tumor disease which led to death due to cancer progression between 2 and 13 months. One patient is surviving 8 months after diagnosis of TC. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms the high incidence of tumors and in particular tongue tumors in allotransplanted FA patients. A careful screening has to be life-long maintained.

METHODS: Retrospective study in 22 FA patients who had received HSCT and had been followed up beyond 2 years after HSCT. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 15 years. Six patients developed head-and-neck SCC after transplantation. The cumulative incidence of SCC at 15 and 30 years from the HSCT was 14.2% and 71.2%, respectively. One patient was diagnosed in stage IV and the rest, who were being followed up in cancer screening programs, in stage I. Treatment of SCC consisted of surgery in all patients; radiotherapy and chemotherapy were used in two patients and were poorly tolerated. CONCLUSION: FA patients have high risk of head-and-neck SCC. Multi-disciplinary programs for early cancer detection are of special relevance in these patients.",

Treatment is complicated by high vulnerability to treatment-associated side effects, yet structured data are lacking. This study aims at giving a comprehensive overview about clinical and molecular characteristics of pediatric FA MB patients. METHODS: Clinical data including detailed information on treatment and toxicities of six previously unreported FA MB patients were supplemented with data of 16 published cases. RESULTS: We identified 22 cases of children with FA and MB with clinical data available. All MBs with subgroup reporting were SHH-activated (n=9), confirmed by methylation profiling in five patients. FA MB patients exclusively belonged to complementation groups FA-D1 (n=16) or FA-N (n=3). Patients were treated with postoperative chemotherapy only (50%) or radiotherapy (RT)+-chemotherapy (27%). 23% did not receive adjuvant therapy. Excessive treatment-related toxicities were frequent. Severe hematological toxicity occurred in 91% of patients treated with alkylating chemotherapy, while non-alkylating agents and RT were less toxic. Median overall survival (OS) was 1 year (95%CI 0.3-1.8). 1-year-progression-free-survival (PFS) was 26.3+-10.1% and 1-year-OS was 42.1+-11.3%. Adjuvant therapy prolonged survival (1y-OS/1y-PFS 0%/0% without adjuvant therapy vs. 53.3+-12.9%/33.3+-12.2% with adjuvant therapy, p=0.006/p=0.086). CONCLUSIONS: MB in FA patients is strongly associated with SHH activation and FA-D1/FA-N. Despite the dismal prognosis, adjuvant therapy may prolong survival. Non-alkylating chemotherapy and RT are feasible in selected patients with careful monitoring of toxicities and dose adjustments. Curative therapy for FA MB-SHH remains an unmet medical need.",

                    "abstract": "Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) can cure blood dyscrasias and reduce the risk of hematologic cancers in patients with inherited bone marrow failure syndromes (IBMFS). However, because of its high mortality rate, HCT is generally reserved until patients with IBMFS manifest life-threatening cytopenias or myeloid malignancy, at which point outcomes are poor. Screening tests that accurately predict transformation and enable timely intervention are lacking. These unknowns and risks limit the use of HCT in patients with IBMFS, sometimes until significant disease-related sequelae have occurred. A major goal for IBMFS is to reduce cellular therapy-related complications to the point that earlier intervention can be considered before significant transfusion exposure, occurrence of comorbidities, or malignant transformation. In recent decades, disease-specific allogeneic HCT trials have yielded significant improvements in outcomes in IBMFS conditions, including Fanconi anemia and dyskeratosis congenita. This is in large part due to marked reductions in conditioning intensity to address the increased sensitivity of these patients to cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation. The success of these approaches may also indicate an ability to leverage intrinsic fitness defects of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells across IBMFS disorders. Now with advances in tracking somatic genetic evolution in hematopoiesis and tailored minimal intensity conditioning regimens, this question arises: is it time for preventative HCT for IBMFS?",

Among 287 AA patients who excluded Fanconi anemia (FA), Congenital dyskeratosis (DKC), Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), etc.112 underwent matched sibling donor (MSD)-HSCT, 91 matched unrelated donor-HSCT and 84 haploidentical-HSCT. Patients were divided into the following 4 groups: group 1: Donor chimerism (DC); group 2: MC without cytopenia; group 3: MC with cytopenia; group 4: secondary graft failure (SGF). Compared with the other three groups, SGF predicted a poor prognosis of SAA (P< 0.001). In addition, SGF was associated with the early (within 3 months after transplantation) presence of MC and the high levels of MC. Uni- and multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that donor/recipient sex-mismatching and CTX + ATG regimen were high-risk factors for MC. Of note, in MC patients with cytopenia (group 3), the effective response rate reached 55% (6/11) following enhanced immunosuppression combined with cellular therapy, while only one of the four was effective who received enhanced immunosuppression alone. SGF was associated with poor prognosis, early presence of MC and increased levels of recipient chimerism. The donor/recipient sex-mismatching and CTX + ATG regimen based MSD-HSCT were risk factors for MC. Cellular therapy could improve the effective response rate of patients with progressive MC.",

It delves into hereditary conditions that affect platelet production and count, such as RUNX1, ETV6, and ANKRD26, detailing their clinical features and how they contribute to an increased risk of MDS. The discussion extends to additional genetic syndromes like GATA2 deficiency, telomere biology disorders, Fanconi anemia, and Li-Fraumeni syndrome, along with new findings on genes like ERG that offer new insights into disease etiology. The importance of genetic counseling in MDS is underscored, outlining its goals, methods for evaluating family history, risk assessment, and the ethical considerations involved. Furthermore, the role of hematopoietic cell transplantation in managing MDS, particularly in patients with germline syndromes, is reviewed, emphasizing the need for optimal donor selection and personalized treatment approaches. This comprehensive overview illustrates the critical role of genetic factors in MDS and highlights the need for continued research and tailored clinical practices to improve patient outcomes.",

Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), the only potentially curative treatment for the hematological complications of FA, may precipitate acute kidney injury (AKI) and hypertension. We retrospectively investigated 107 FA patients who underwent HCT between 2009 and 2017. We investigated the incidence and risk factors of AKI within 100 days after HCT in a cohort of FA patients, and kidney function and hypertension over 2-year follow-up.The incidence of AKI (mainly stage I) was 18.7%. Patients aged >= 11 years at transplantation showed a higher risk of AKI (OR 3.53). The eGFR was 60-90 mL/min/1.73 m2 in 53 (49.5%), 55 (51.4%), 50 (50.5%), 50 (51%), and 46 (59.7%) patients before HCT, at 100 days, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years. Within the first 100 days after HCT, hypertension was observed in 72% of the patients and was associated with cyclosporine therapy. Most (62.3%) patients had stage 2 hypertension. CAKUT was observed in 33.7% of the patients and was associated with both hypertension (86%) and diminished kidney function but not with AKI.Conlusion: Although AKI, a commonly known HCT complication, was mild in this study, the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD), as well as the high incidence of hypertension, specially associated with CAKUT point out the importance of kidney care in short and long-term follow up of FA patients. What is Known:   Fanconi anemia (FA) is the most frequent inherited bone marrow failure in children, and 30% of cases have congenital anomalies of kidney (CAKUT).   Acute kidney injury and hypertension after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) may impact the outcomes.. What is New:   Despite the presence of CAKUT and stage 2 CKD in 33.7% and 50% of the patients, respectively, AKI was mild and transitory after HCT in FA patients.   CAKUT in FA patients was associated with lower kidney function and hypertension after HCT.",

The most common IBMFS include Fanconi anemia, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, Diamond-Blackfan anemia, and telomere biology disorders/ dyskeratosis congenita. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) is a well-established curative treatment to correct the hematological manifestations but does not halt or reverse the nonhematological complications and may hasten them. With advances in HCT and in our ability to care for patients with IBMFS, an increasing number of survivors are making it imperative to not only diagnose but also treat late effects from the pre-, peri-, and post-HCT course and complications relating to the natural history of the syndrome. As the field of HCT evolves to allow for the incorporation of alternate graft sources, for expansion of donor options to include unrelated and mismatched donors, and for use of reduced-intensity conditioning or reduced toxicity myeloablative regimens, we have yet to determine if these advances modify the disease-specific course. While long-term outcomes of these patients are often included under one umbrella, this article seeks to address disease-specific post-HCT outcomes within IBMFS.",

Eighty-nine patients, 70 with bone marrow failure +/- cytogenetic abnormalities, 19 with MDS/AML, were included. Five-year overall survival (OS) was 83.2% and event-free survival (EFS) was 74%.

                    "abstract": "Fanconi anemia (FA) cells are characterized by genomic instability, which places FA patients at risk for malignancies such as leukemia and oropharyngeal/urogenital cancers. The risk of development of leukemia is theoretically eliminated after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Mixed chimerism (MC) in FA patients might have a unique implication because the persistent existence of FA cells might give rise to a malignant clone. We have studied a large population of FA patients who underwent allogeneic HCT at our institution and report here the outcome according to chimerism status. Patients with FA who had evidence of progressive bone marrow failure and were blood products-transfusion dependent (packed red blood cells, platelets, or both) were included in the study. Those who had myelodysplasia (MDS) or an abnormal clone or evidence of leukemia were excluded. All but 3 patients had normal renal and cardiac function at the time of transplantation. In total, 160 patients with FA underwent allogeneic HCT at our center from January 1995 to December 2017; mean age at HCT was 8.4. Chimerism data at last follow-up visit were available on 97 patients who are the subjects of this analysis (no day +100 chimerism data on one of them). On day +100, 46 patients (47.9%) had full chimerism (FC) and 50 (52.1%) had MC, whereas at last follow-up 50 (51.5%) exhibited FC and the remaining 47 (48.5%) had MC. Cumulative incidence of all grades acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was 13.4% and that of grade III to IV GVHD was 4.1%. Chronic GVHD was seen in eight (8.0%) patients. Incidence of severe acute GVHD (grade >= III) and that of chronic GVHD were not significantly associated with FC or MC measured at day +100 (P values = .347 and .254, respectively), nor at the last follow-up. Graft failure occurred in 2 patients; both from the MC at day +100 group. No graft failures occurred in the FC at day +100 group (P value = 1.00). At a median follow-up of 83.8 months (95% confidence interval, 51.0-116.6; range, 19.3-181.1 months) the cumulative probability of overall survival (OS) at 5 years was 95.7% +- 2.1%. Mean follow-up time in our cohort was 90.7 months. Five-year overall survival was not significantly associated with FC or MC evaluated at day +100 (95.7% +- 3.0% versus 95.6% +- 3.1%, P value = .908) nor at the last follow-up (96.0% +- 2.8% versus 95.4% +- 3.2%, P value = .925). No patient in either group developed MDS/leukemia during the follow-up period. We conclude that mixed chimerism in patients with FA appears to have no adverse effect on outcome in our follow-up period. A longer follow-up period is needed, however, to confirm the validity of this statement.",

We compared HCT outcomes using HLA-mismatched unrelated donors (MMUD; n = 123) or haplo-identical donors (HDs), either using only in vivo T cell depletion (n = 33) or T cells depleted in vivo with some type of graft manipulation ex vivo (n = 59) performed for FA between 2000 and 2018. Overall survival (OS) by 24 months was 62% (53-71%) for MMUD, versus 80% (66-95%) for HDs with only in vivo T cell depletion and 60% (47-73%) for HDs with in vivo and ex vivo T cell depletion (p = .22). Event-free survival (EFS) was better for HD-transplanted FA patients with only in vivo T cell depletion 86% (73-99%) than for those transplanted from a MMUD 58% (48-68%) or those with graft manipulation 56% (42-69%) (p = .046). Grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was 41% (MMUD) versus 40% (HDs with no graft manipulation) versus 17% (HDs with T cell depleted graft), (p = .005). No differences were found for the other transplant related outcomes. These data suggest that HDs might be considered as an alternative option for FA patients with better EFS using unmanipulated grafts.",

Post-transplantation kidney injury is a common complication and involves a wide spectrum of structural abnormalities, including glomerular (MSPGN, mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis; FSGS, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis; MPGN, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis; MCD, minimal change disease), vascular (TMA, thrombotic microangiopathy), and/or tubulointerstitial (TIN, tubulointerstitial nephritis; ATI, acute tubular injury). Renal biopsy is the gold-standard examination for defining multiple etiologies of kidney impairment. Although kidney injury following HSCT has been studied, little is known about the effects of allo-HSCT on renal pathology in pediatric patients. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed renal biopsy specimens from children with kidney injury after allo-HSCT and correlated results with clinical data in the last 10 years. RESULTS: Among 25 children (18 males and 7 females), three patients had proteinuria indicating nephrotic syndrome (24-hour urinary total protein/weight > 50 mg/kg/d), nine patients had severely reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m2) and four patients received kidney replacement therapy (KRT). The main pathologies identified from kidney biopsies were MSPGN (n = 12), FSGS (n = 12), MPGN (n = 5), TMA (n = 4), MCD (n = 3), diffuse glomerular fibrosis (DGF, n = 2), ATI and TIN, in isolation or combined with other pathologies. The median follow-up time was 16.5 (0.5 ~ 68.0) months. Three patients died of recurrent malignancy and/or severe infection, one child developed to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), six patients (24%) had elevated serum creatinine (SCr > 100micromol/l) and nine patients (36%) still had proteinuria. CONCLUSIONS: This study evaluates histomorphologic findings from kidney biopsies of pediatric recipients following allo-HSCT. Detailed evaluation of renal biopsy samples is helpful to elucidate the nature of renal insult, and may potentially identify treatable disease processes.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: The DNA damage immune response (DDIR) assay was developed in breast cancer based on biology associated with deficiencies in homologous recombination and Fanconi anemia pathways. A positive DDIR call identifies patients likely to respond to platinum-based chemotherapies in breast and esophageal cancers. In colorectal cancer, there is currently no biomarker to predict response to oxaliplatin. We tested the ability of the DDIR assay to predict response to oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in colorectal cancer and characterized the biology in DDIR-positive colorectal cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Samples and clinical data were assessed according to DDIR status from patients who received either 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or 5FUFA (bolus and infusion 5-FU with folinic acid) plus oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) within the FOCUS trial (n = 361, stage IV), or neoadjuvant FOLFOX in the FOxTROT trial (n = 97, stage II/III). Whole transcriptome, mutation, and IHC data of these samples were used to interrogate the biology of DDIR in colorectal cancer. RESULTS: Contrary to our hypothesis, DDIR-negative patients displayed a trend toward improved outcome for oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy compared with DDIR-positive patients. DDIR positivity was associated with microsatellite instability (MSI) and colorectal molecular subtype 1. Refinement of the DDIR signature, based on overlapping IFN-related chemokine signaling associated with DDIR positivity across colorectal cancer and breast cancer cohorts, further confirmed that the DDIR assay did not have predictive value for oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in colorectal cancer. CONCLUSIONS: DDIR positivity does not predict improved response following oxaliplatin treatment in colorectal cancer. However, data presented here suggest the potential of the DDIR assay in identifying immune-rich tumors that may benefit from immune checkpoint blockade, beyond current use of MSI status.",

We report the case of a patient with advanced gastric cancer, Fanconi anemia (FA), and primary biliary cholangitis. A 26-year-old woman visited a local physician complaining of epigastralgia. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed edematous changes with poor distension and circumferential thickened folds with erosions in the gastric body. Biopsy results of the lesion specimens revealed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed gastric wall with irregular thickness, several nodules in the peritoneal cavity, and a mass lesion in the right ovary. We diagnosed the patient with T4N2M1 stage IV gastric cancer accompanied by peritoneal and ovarian metastases and initiated nivolumab with S-1 plus oxaliplatin as the first-line treatment regimen. Because of immune-related adverse events after one course of systemic treatment, the regimen was changed to ramucirumab combined with nab-paclitaxel chemotherapy as the second-line treatment. After three cycles of weekly nab-paclitaxel with ramucirumab, the decreased platelet count did not recover, and her general condition gradually deteriorated. Comprehensive genome profiling using next-generation sequencing was performed to determine the feasibility of genotype-matched therapies. Alterations in FA complementation group A (FANCA) F1263del (49.1%) and E484Q (12.3%), which encode a key component of the multiprotein FA complex, were identified. The patient died 10 months after treatment initiation. In conclusion, when treating malignancies in adolescent and young adult patients, the genomic background should be considered.",

METHODS: Retrospective study in 22 FA patients who had received HSCT and had been followed up beyond 2 years after HSCT. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 15 years. Six patients developed head-and-neck SCC after transplantation. The cumulative incidence of SCC at 15 and 30 years from the HSCT was 14.2% and 71.2%, respectively. One patient was diagnosed in stage IV and the rest, who were being followed up in cancer screening programs, in stage I. Treatment of SCC consisted of surgery in all patients; radiotherapy and chemotherapy were used in two patients and were poorly tolerated. CONCLUSION: FA patients have high risk of head-and-neck SCC. Multi-disciplinary programs for early cancer detection are of special relevance in these patients.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The patient database from the Bone Marrow Transplant Center of Pescara was reviewed to enroll FA patients. Patients', donors', HCT's, and screening's data were collected as well to look for the incidence and the treatment of TC. RESULTS: Twelve patients affected by FA were identified. Three patients died for transplant-related causes. Five of nine surviving patients were diagnosed with TC at a median of 21.7 years since transplantation and at a median age of 32.10 years. Interestingly, no patient manifested graft-versus-host-disease (GvHD). The 28-year cumulative incidence function of TC was 46.9% (95% CI, 36.9-56.9%). Two patients were treated with chemotherapy alone, two patients were treated with surgery alone, and one with surgery followed by chemotherapy. Overall, 4 patients with TC showed a clinical course characterized by a marked aggressiveness of the tumor disease which led to death due to cancer progression between 2 and 13 months. One patient is surviving 8 months after diagnosis of TC. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms the high incidence of tumors and in particular tongue tumors in allotransplanted FA patients. A careful screening has to be life-long maintained.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a critical condition characterized by a dysregulated immune response to infection, often resulting in organ dysfunction. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a key proinflammatory cytokine associated with sepsis and its complications. This case study explored the use of Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT) combined with Cytosorb in managing pediatric patients with leukemia, severe thrombocytopenia, and elevated IL-6 levels. CASE PRESENTATION: A 10-year-old boy with Fanconi anemia presented with pancytopenia, fever, and necrotic lesions, indicative of mucormycosis. Following the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the patient experienced severe complications, including septic shock. Despite appropriate treatment, inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), and IL-6, were significantly elevated. CRRT with Cytosorb was initiated to manage hypercytokinemia and improve the patient's clinical status. INTERVENTION: The CRRT procedure utilizes citrate as an anticoagulant because of severe thrombocytopenia. The treatment lasted for 20 h, during which the inflammatory biomarkers were monitored. The post-treatment results indicated a significant reduction in IL-6 levels within 24 h and a decrease in PCT levels at 8 h. CRP levels gradually declined over 40 h. OUTCOME: The patient exhibited marked clinical improvement, with significant healing of cutaneous lesions and stabilization of inflammatory markers, allowing transfer to the ward for continued chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: This case suggests that CRRT combined with cytosorb may be a valuable adjunctive therapy for managing complex cases of septic shock. The observed reduction in inflammatory markers, particularly IL-6, warrants further investigation. Concurrent antimicrobial, antifungal, and dexamethasone treatments for IRIS may have influenced the observed outcomes in this single case. Controlled studies are needed to evaluate the specific contribution of Cytosorb-CRRT and assess its long-term efficacy and safety in similar patient populations, particularly in resource-limited settings.

METHODS: According to the inclusion criteria, we selected 395 DNA samples from NSCLC patients for genotyping and combined with clinical data for Cox regression analysis and stratification analyses to assess relationships between overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) with SNPs genotypes. RESULTS: The results revealed that patients with FANCE rs6907678 TT genotype have a longer OS than TC and CC genotype (Additive model: P = 0.004, HR = 1.696, 95% CI = 1.186-2.425). In stratification analyses, Longer PFS is found in female, age <= 55 years old and non-smoking patients with FANCE rs6907678 TT genotype, and patients with TT genotypes were significantly had longer OS in male, age >55 years old, non-smoking, squamous cell carcinoma and stage IV stratification. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrates that patients with FANCE rs6907678 TT genotype are contributed to better prognosis. FANCE rs6907678 may be used as a clinical biomarker for predicting the prognosis of NSCLC patients with platinum-based chemotherapy.",

Six patients developed head-and-neck SCC after transplantation. The cumulative incidence of SCC at 15 and 30 years from the HSCT was 14.2% and 71.2%, respectively. One patient was diagnosed in stage IV and the rest, who were being followed up in cancer screening programs, in stage I. Treatment of SCC consisted of surgery in all patients; radiotherapy and chemotherapy were used in two patients and were poorly tolerated. CONCLUSION: FA patients have high risk of head-and-neck SCC. Multi-disciplinary programs for early cancer detection are of special relevance in these patients.",

Treatment options include immunosuppressive therapy (IST) and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). OBJECTIVE: To analyze the outcomes of pediatric patients diagnosed with BMF treated in a tertiary care center. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Retrospective study of pediatric patients diagnosed with BMF who consulted at Fundacion Valle de Lili, Cali. Descriptive statistical analysis was performed according to Acquired BMF (ABMF) and Inherited BMF (IBMF). The outcomes include treatment, complications, overall survival (OS) in transplant patients, calculated using the Kaplan Meier method. RESULTS: We included 24 patients with BMF, average age 6.5 +- 4 years, and 50% were women. 58% presented IBMF, 9 with Fanconi anemia (FA), 2 dyskeratosis congenita, 2 congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia, and 1 presented Diamond-Blackfan anemia. 12 patients treated with HSCT had a 5-year OS of 83%. ABMF represented 42%. 6 patients received IST-HSCT, 3 received IST, and 1 received HSCT. The OS of the IST-HSCT group was 86%. Six patients died, four of them related to infection. CONCLUSIONS: In this series, there was a higher number of cases with IBMF. The OS of patients treated with HSCT is similar to that reported in recent studies. The most frequent cause of death was of infectious origin which has also been previously reported. The treatment esta blished in the patients showed favorable results in a Latin American tertiary care center.",

We performed a retrospective multicenter study on 813 FA children undergoing first HSCT between 2010 and 2018. Median duration of follow-up was 3.7 years (interquartile range, 3.4-4.0). Median age at transplant was 8.8 years (6.5-18.1). Overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS) and GvHD-free, relapse-free survival (GRFS) at 5 years were 83% (80-86%), 78% (75-81%) and 70% (67-74%) respectively. OS was comparable between matched family donor (MFD, n=441, 88%) and matched unrelated donor (MUD, n=162, 86%) and was superior to that of mismatched family or unrelated donor (MMFD/MMUD, n=144, 72%) and haploidentical donor (HID) (n=66, 70%, p<0.001). In multivariable analysis, a transplant indication of acute myeloid leukaemia/myelodysplastic syndrome compared to AA/BMF, use of MMFD/MMUD and HID compared to MFD, Fludarabine-Cyclophosphamide (FluCy) + other conditioning compared to FluCy independently predicted inferior OS, while alemtuzumab compared to ATG was associated with better OS. Age   10 years was associated with worse EFS and GRFS. Cumulative incidences (CIN) of primary and secondary graft failure were 2% (1-3%) and 3% (2-4%) respectively. CIN of grade II-IV acute GvHD, grade III-IV acute GvHD and chronic GvHD were 23% (20-26%), 12% (10-15%) and 8% (6-10%) respectively. The 5-year CIN of secondary malignancy was 2% (1-3%).

FA is caused by a defective repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks and to date, mutations in over 20 genes have been linked to the disease. Advances in science and molecular biology have provided new insight between FA gene mutations and the severity of clinical manifestations. Here, we will highlight the current and promising therapeutic options for this rare disease. The current standard treatment for FA patients is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, a treatment associated to exposure to radiation or chemotherapy, immunological complications, plus opportunistic infections from prolonged immune incompetence or increased risk of morbidity. New arising treatments include gene addition therapy, genome editing using CRISPR-Cas9 nuclease, and hematopoietic stem cell generation from induced pluripotent stem cells. Finally, we will also discuss the revolutionary developments in mRNA therapeutics as an opportunity for this disease.",

                    "abstract": "Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a curative treatment for patients with many different blood and immune diseases; however, current treatment regimens contain non-specific chemotherapy and/or irradiation conditioning, which carry both short-term and long-term toxicities. The use of such agents may be particularly harmful for patients with Fanconi anemia (FA), who have genetic mutations resulting in deficiencies in DNA repair, leading to increased sensitivity to genotoxic agents. mAb-based conditioning has been proposed as an alternative conditioning strategy for HSCT that minimizes these toxicities by eliminating collateral tissue damage. Given the high need for improved treatments for FA patients, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of different alphaCD117 mAb agents and immunosuppression on hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) depletion and explored their ability to safely establish therapeutic donor hematopoiesis post-HSCT in FA disease models. We evaluated the effects of different concentrations of alphaCD117 mAbs in vitro and in vivo on HSC growth and depletion. To further assess the efficacy of mAb-based conditioning, Fancd2-/- animals were treated with alphaCD117 mAb and combination agents with alphaCD47 mAb and antibody-drug-conjugates (ADCs) for syngeneic HSCT. Immunosuppression alphaCD4 mAb was added to all in vivo experiments due to a slightly mismatched background between the donor grafts and recipients. Immunosuppressant cocktails were also given to Fancd2-/- animals to evaluate the efficacy of mAb-based conditioning in the haploidentical setting. Statistical analyses were done using the unpaired t-test. We found that antagonistic alphaCD117 mAbs alone do not deplete host HSCs or enhance HSCT effectively in FA mouse models; however, the potency of alphaCD117 mAbs can be safely augmented through combination with alphaCD47 mAbs and with ADCs, both of which lead to profound HSC depletion and establishment of long-term donor engraftment post-syngeneic HSCT. This is the first time these approaches have been tested in parallel in any disease setting, with the greatest donor engraftment observed after CD117-ADC conditioning. Interestingly, our data also suggest that HSC-targeted conditioning is not necessary in HSCT for FA, as high donor HSC engraftment was observed with mAb-based immune suppression alone with immunologically matched and mismatched haploidentical grafts. These results demonstrate the safety and efficacy of several different non-genotoxic mAb-based conditioning strategies in the FA setting. In addition, they show that if sufficient immunosuppression is given to obtain initial donor HSC engraftment, turnover of a majority of the hematolymphoid system can result, likely owing to the survival advantage of wild-type HSCs over FA HSCs. Such non-toxic all-mAb-based conditioning strategies could be transformative for FA patients and those with other hematolymphoid diseases.",

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of patients with Fanconi Anemia from a quaternary referral center between 2007-2021 was completed for head and neck cancer risk. RESULTS: One hundred and five FA patients were reviewed. Average age at presentation was 11.3 years old and 90.5% of patients underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). A total of 8.6% of patients had leukoplakia or erythroplakia and 3.8% developed malignancy. The standardized incidence ratio of head and neck malignancy was 483.8. Patients presented with leukoplakia and malignancy at an average age of 14.6 and 25.1 years old, respectively. Malignancies were aggressive and marked by recurrence. There were no premalignant or malignant lesions found on flexible laryngoscopy. This series represents the largest longitudinal series of pediatric FA head and neck lesions.

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the only curative treatment in these cases. Here, we aimed to report our clinical experience in pediatric patients with Fanconi anemia treated with haploidentical stem cell transplantation and post-transplant cyclophosphamide, an alternative strategy. METHODS: We performed a case report based on clinical records of two patients who signed the informed consent form and were treated at Fundacion Valle del Lili. RESULT: Two pediatric patients, both with reduced-intensity conditioning, prophylaxis for acute graft-versus-host disease with post-transplant cyclophosphamide. They achieved primary neutrophil/platelets engraftment, and 100% chimerism. Had grade I or II graft-versus-host disease resolved? Currently are alive and in complete remission. CONCLUSIONS: The use of mismatched related donors for haploidentical stem cell transplantation and post-transplant cyclophosphamide might be a promising option, and well-tolerated in pediatric patients. Serial chimerism can be useful during follow-up.",

It is difficult to differentiate gonadal dysfunction from the primary disease itself or from HSCT procedures. Therefore, it is important to manage expectations about gonadal failure and infertility for all patients with FA, regardless of HSCT status. We performed a retrospective analysis of 98 pediatric patients with FA who were transplanted between July 1990 to June 2020 to evaluate the incidence of gonadal dysfunction in female and male patients with FA. New onset premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) was diagnosed in a total of 30 (52.6%) patients. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels were increased in patients diagnosed with POI. Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) levels declined in POI patients after HSCT (r2 = 0.21, p = 0.001). Twenty (48.8%) male patients were diagnosed with testicular failure. FSH levels increased after HSCT even in patients without testicular failure (r2=0.17, p=0.005). Inhibin B levels decreased over time after HSCT in patients with testicular failure (r2 = 0.14, p = 0.001).

We aimed to evaluate the incidence, clinical, and imaging features of PRES in pediatric patients with Fanconi anemia (FA) following HSCT. This prospective study included all post-HSCT patients with underlying FA disease between 2014 and 2017. Brain computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed in all individuals who developed neurologic symptoms. PRES was diagnosed based on clinic-radiological evidence. Follow-up MRI was performed in all patients with PRES within two months. Forty-one patients with FA (28 males; mean age, 8.19 +- 3.25 years) were enrolled. Out of 15 patients with acute neurologic symptoms, PRES was diagnosed in 9 individuals (21.95% of the total cohort). The occurrence of PRES was significantly higher in patients who had a donor with a 1-locus mismatch (P= .02). Donor relation, stem cell source, and graft-versus-host disease grade did not have any significant association with the development of PRES. MRI showed asymmetric vasogenic edema in 5 patients, an overt infarct in 1 patient, and foci of microhemorrhages in 3 patients, 1 of whom developed a hemorrhagic infarct. This patient died shortly, and persistent microhemorrhages were noted in the other 2 patients. Our findings demonstrate a greater risk of developing PRES after HSCT in patients with FA compared with those with other diseases (21.95% versus 1% to 10%), and in contrast to its term, it might be irreversible and has adverse effects on HSCT outcomes. The increased vascular and endothelial fragility in FA may contribute to the higher frequency of PRES in these individuals.",

Over the last two decades, HSCT outcomes have improved dramatically following the development of regimens tailored for FA patients. In this study, we analyzed genetic, clinical, and transplant data of 41 patients with FA who underwent HSCT at Hadassah Medical Center between November 1996 and September 2020. Overall survival (OS) was 82.9% with a median follow-up time of 2.11-years (95% CI, .48-16.56). Thirteen patients (31.7%) developed acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), three of them with grades 3-4. Nine patients developed chronic GVHD, five had extensive disease. Twelve patients (29.3%) developed stable mixed-chimerism with complete resolution of bone marrow failure (BMF); none of them had acute nor chronic GVHD. Significantly higher GVHD rates were observed in transplants from peripheral blood stem cell grafts as compared to other stem cell sources (p = .002 for acute and p = .004 for chronic GVHD). Outcome parameters were comparable between HSCT from matched-sibling (n = 20) to other donors (n = 21), including survival rates (p = .1), time to engraftment (p = .69 and p = .14 for neutrophil and platelet engraftment time, respectively), chimerism status (p = .36 and p = .83 for full-donor and mixed chimerism, respectively), and GVHD prevalence (p = 1). Our results demonstrate the vast improvements in HSCT outcomes of patients with FA, narrowing the gap between matched-sibling versus alternative donor transplantations. Our data identifies factors that may significantly affect transplant outcomes such as graft source and chimerism status.",

Median age at transplant was 8.8 years (6.5-18.1). Overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS) and GvHD-free, relapse-free survival (GRFS) at 5 years were 83% (80-86%), 78% (75-81%) and 70% (67-74%) respectively. OS was comparable between matched family donor (MFD, n=441, 88%) and matched unrelated donor (MUD, n=162, 86%) and was superior to that of mismatched family or unrelated donor (MMFD/MMUD, n=144, 72%) and haploidentical donor (HID) (n=66, 70%, p<0.001). In multivariable analysis, a transplant indication of acute myeloid leukaemia/myelodysplastic syndrome compared to AA/BMF, use of MMFD/MMUD and HID compared to MFD, Fludarabine-Cyclophosphamide (FluCy) + other conditioning compared to FluCy independently predicted inferior OS, while alemtuzumab compared to ATG was associated with better OS. Age   10 years was associated with worse EFS and GRFS. Cumulative incidences (CIN) of primary and secondary graft failure were 2% (1-3%) and 3% (2-4%) respectively. CIN of grade II-IV acute GvHD, grade III-IV acute GvHD and chronic GvHD were 23% (20-26%), 12% (10-15%) and 8% (6-10%) respectively. The 5-year CIN of secondary malignancy was 2% (1-3%).

                    "abstract": "The advent of new technologies has made it possible to identify genetic predispositions to myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute leukemias (AL) more frequently. The most frequent and best characterized at present are mutations in CEBPA, RUNX1, GATA2, ETV6 and DDX41 and, either in the presence of one of these mutations with a high allelic frequency, or in the case of a personal or family history suggestive of blood abnormalities such as non-immune thrombocytopenia, it is recommended to look for the possibility of a hereditary hematological malignancy (HHM). Indeed, early recognition of these HHMs allows better adaptation of the management of patients and their relatives, as allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is very often proposed for these pathologies. According to current data, with the exception of the GATA2 mutation, the constitutional or somatic nature of the mutations does not seem to influence the prognosis of hematological diseases. Therefore, the indication for an allograft will be determined according to the usual criteria. However, when searching for a family donor, it is important to ensure that there is no hereditary disease in the donor. In order to guarantee the possibility of performing the HSC allograft within a short period of time, it may be necessary to initiate a parallel procedure to find an unrelated donor. Given the limited information on the modalities of HSC transplantation in this setting, it is important to assess the benefit/risk of the disease and the procedure to decide on the type of conditioning (myeloablative or reduced intensity). In view of the limited experience with the risk of secondary cancers in the medium and long-term, it may be appropriate to recommend reduced intensity conditioning, as in the case of better characterized syndromic hematological diseases such as Fanconi anemia or telomere diseases. In summary, it seems important to evoke HHM more frequently, particularly in the presence of a family history, certain mutations or persistent blood abnormalities, in order to discuss the specific modalities of HSC allografting, particularly with regard to the search for a donor and the evaluation of certain modalities of the procedure, such as conditioning. It should be noted that the discovery of HHM, especially if the indication of an allogeneic HSC transplant is retained, will raise ethical and psychological considerations not only for the patient, but also for his family. A multidisciplinary approach involving molecular biologists, geneticists, hematologists and psychologists is essential.",

Due to DNA instability in FA, RIC has been used to decrease immediate and late complications of HSCT. Most FA conditioning regimens in mismatched and unrelated donor transplants rely on TBI, which increases the risk of secondary malignancies. Most of the non-TBI conditioning regimens use an ex vivo T-cell depletion approach, but this is not feasible at all pediatric stem cell transplant programs. To evaluate the success of HSCT in patients with FA using non-TBI conditioning regimens with in vivo T-cell depletion approach. HSCT using non-TBI based conditioning was performed on two siblings with FA. The first sibling underwent matched unrelated donor transplant with a BM graft using fludarabine, alemtuzumab, busulfan, and cyclophosphamide conditioning and cyclosporine and mycophenolate as GVHD prophylaxis. The second sibling underwent MSD transplant with UCB and BM grafts using similar approach, but without busulfan and mycophenolate. Both siblings had engraftment without signs of acute or chronic GVHD. Acute post-transplant complications included brief viral reactivations. At last follow-up, both siblings continued to have full immune reconstitution with stable chimerism. Conditioning regimens without radiation and inclusion of alemtuzumab can lead to successful engraftment without development of GVHD and reduce risk of developing secondary neoplasms, even with unrelated donor transplants.",

STUDY DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional observational study of 106 consecutive patients with confirmed diagnosis of FA who were followed at the Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) Service at the Federal University of Parana, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil. Participants underwent a complete ophthalmologic evaluation and 84 patients underwent ocular ultrasound examination. This study was conducted between November 2014 and August 2017. RESULTS: The patients ranged in age from 6 months to 43 years of age. Microphthalmia was the most common congenital ocular abnormality (95.2%). A decrease in anthropometric measurements was observed, including palpebral fissure length (78/103 patients [76.5%]), microcornea (48/103 patients [46.6%]), and ptosis (31/103 patients [30.1%]). We identified a new ophthalmic condition in 15 patients with FA, that is, epiretinal tissue on the optic disc. The genetic subtype was identified in 78 patients (79.6%), the FA-A subtype was most prevalent (50%). The most common acquired ocular manifestation (non-graft-versus-host disease [GVHD] related) in patients who did not undergo HSCT (n = 44) was limbal neovascularization (13.6%), whereas in patients who underwent HSCT (n = 62), the GVHD-related manifestation was ocular GVHD (51.6%). The most frequent symptom of ocular GVHD was keratoconjunctivitis sicca (29%). CONCLUSIONS: Several ocular manifestations were identified in patients with FA.",

We report the outcome of 34 patients with FA inside a collaborative multicenter national study based on recommendations of Spanish Working Group for Bone Marrow Transplantation in Children (GETMON) between 2009 and 2016. Fludarabine-based conditioning regimen was carried out in all patients, with low dose total body irradiation in unrelated transplants. Disease status before HSCT was bone marrow failure (BMF) in 30 patients and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in four. Donors were matched siblings donors (MSD) in 18, matched unrelated donors (MUD) in 15, and one haploidentical donor. All except one patient engrafted. Cumulative incidence of grades II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was 29% and 11% for chronic GVHD. Median follow-up after HSCT was 6.5 years. Seven patients (21%) died due to transplant-related causes, two (6%) because of MDS relapse, and one (3%) after a squamous cell carcinoma. Overall survival (OS) was 73% at 5 years post-transplant, with no differences between MSD and MUD transplants. OS for patients with BMF was 80% while for MDS was 25%. Our data suggest HSCT can cure hematologic manifestations of most FA patients with BMF.",

As reverse genetic mosaicism has been described as \"natural gene therapy\" in patients with FA, we sought to evaluate the clinical course of a cohort of FA mosaic patients followed at referral centers in Spain over a 30-year period. This cohort includes patients with a majority of T cells without chromosomal aberrations in the DEB-chromosomal breakage test. Relative to non-mosaic FA patients, we observed a higher proportion of adult patients in the cohort of mosaics, with a later age of hematologic onset and a milder evolution of (BMF). Consequently, the requirement for hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) was also lower. Additional studies allowed us to identify a sub-cohort of mosaic FA patients in whom the reversion was present in bone marrow (BM) progenitor cells leading to multilineage mosaicism. These multilineage mosaic patients are older, have a lower percentage of aberrant cells, have more stable hematology and none of them developed leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome when compared to non-mosaics. In conclusion, our data indicate that reverse mosaicism is a good prognostic factor in FA and is associated with more favorable long-term clinical outcomes.",

                    "abstract": "Fanconi anemia (FA) is an inherited DNA repair disorder characterized by bone marrow (BM) failure, developmental abnormalities, myelodysplasia, and leukemia and solid tumor predisposition. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), a mainstay treatment, is limited by conditioning regimen-related toxicity and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Antibody-drug-conjugates (ADCs) targeting hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) can open marrow niches permitting donor stem cell alloengraftment. Here, we report that single dose anti-mouse CD45-targeted-ADC (CD45-ADC) facilitated stable, multilineage chimerism in 3 distinct FA mouse models representing 90% of FA complementation groups. CD45-ADC profoundly depleted host stem cell enriched Lineage Sca1+cKit+ cells within 48 hours. Fanca-/- recipients of minor-mismatched BM and single dose CD45-ADC had peripheral blood (PB) mean donor chimerism >90%; donor HSCs alloengraftment was verified in secondary recipients. In Fancc-/- and Fancg-/- recipients of fully allogeneic grafts, PB mean donor chimerism was 60-80% and 70-80%, respectively. The mean percent donor chimerism in BM and spleen mirrored PB results. CD45-ADC conditioned mice did not have clinical toxicity. A transient <2.5-fold increase in hepatocellular enzymes and mild-to-moderate histopathological changes were seen. Under GVHD allo-HSCT conditions, wildtype and Fanca-/- recipients of CD45-ADC had markedly reduced GVHD lethality compared to lethal irradiation. Moreover, single dose anti-human CD45-ADC given to rhesus macaque nonhuman primates on days -6 or -10 was at least as myeloablative as lethal irradiation. These data suggest that CD45-ADC can potently promote donor alloengraftment and hematopoiesis without significant toxicity or severe GVHD, as seen with lethal irradiation, providing strong support for clinical trial considerations in highly vulnerable FA patients.",

Sustained primary engraftment was achieved in 22 (91.6%) of 24 patients, with median time to neutrophil recovery of 12 days (range, 9-15 days) and platelet recovery of 10 days (range, 7-14 days). Cumulative incidences of grade 1 to 2 acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and chronic GVHD were 17.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.5%-35.5%) and 5.5% (95% CI, 0.8%-33.4%), respectively. The conditioning regimen, which included fludarabine, low-dose cyclophosphamide and, in most patients, single-dose irradiation was well tolerated; no fatal transplant-related toxicity was observed. With a median follow-up of 5.2 years (range, 0.3-8.7 years), the overall and event-free survival probabilities were 100% and 86.3% (95% CI, 62.8%-95.4%), respectively (2 graft failures and 1 case of poor graft function were considered as events). The 2 patients who experienced primary graft failure underwent a subsequent successful HSCT from the other parent. This is the first report of FA patients given TCRalphabeta+/CD19+-depleted haplo-HSCT in the context of a prospective trial, and the largest series of T-cell-depleted haplo-HSCT in FA reported to date. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT01810120.",

We report the outcome of 34 patients with FA inside a collaborative multicenter national study based on recommendations of Spanish Working Group for Bone Marrow Transplantation in Children (GETMON) between 2009 and 2016. Fludarabine-based conditioning regimen was carried out in all patients, with low dose total body irradiation in unrelated transplants. Disease status before HSCT was bone marrow failure (BMF) in 30 patients and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in four. Donors were matched siblings donors (MSD) in 18, matched unrelated donors (MUD) in 15, and one haploidentical donor. All except one patient engrafted. Cumulative incidence of grades II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was 29% and 11% for chronic GVHD. Median follow-up after HSCT was 6.5 years. Seven patients (21%) died due to transplant-related causes, two (6%) because of MDS relapse, and one (3%) after a squamous cell carcinoma. Overall survival (OS) was 73% at 5 years post-transplant, with no differences between MSD and MUD transplants. OS for patients with BMF was 80% while for MDS was 25%.

                    "abstract": "Fanconi anemia is the most common inherited bone marrow failure syndrome, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative option. Post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) is challenging in this group of children, given their increased sensitivity to chemotherapy. We performed a retrospective analysis of the data on children diagnosed with Fanconi anemia who underwent a haploidentical HSCT with PTCy from January 2014 to December 2019. Nineteen children (male/female, 0.75:1) underwent 21 haplo-HSCTs with PTCy. Fludarabine, low-dose cyclophosphamide, and 200 centi-gray total body irradiation were included in the conditioning regimen with 25 mg/kg PTCy on days +3 and +4. Haplo-graft was from a sibling in 38% and father in 57% of transplants. The source of stem cells was peripheral blood stem cells in 81% and bone marrow in 19% of transplants, with a median CD34 dose of 5.0 x 106/kg. We documented engraftment in 84% and primary graft failure in 10% of transplants. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) was infused concomitantly during cyclophosphamide in 13 children. Grade 2 and 3 mucositis was lower among those who received NAC as compared to those who did not (30% and 15% versus 33% and 50%), while transaminitis was higher among those who did not receive the infusion. The incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was 68%, and 81% of these were steroid responsive (grade I/II). We documented chronic GVHD in 25% children, predominantly involving the skin and mouth, which responded to low-dose steroids and ruxolitinib. Serum ferritin was monitored twice weekly as a surrogate marker for cytokine release syndrome due to nonavailability of IL-6 levels. A 1- or 2-log increase in the titers of ferritin associated with clinical features guided the early addition of steroids in the periengraftment period. The mean survival was found to be less among those with high serum ferritin (>10,000 ng/dL) in the periengraftment period as compared to those with ferritin <10,000 ng/dL (mean survival of 25 +- 10 months versus 50 +- 6 months, respectively). The overall survival in our cohort was 68.4%, with a mean survival time of 41.5 months (95% confidence interval, 29.3 to 53.8 months), with a statistically significant correlation between inferior outcome and having received over 15 transfusions before HSCT (P = .01). PTCy can be considered a viable option in children with Fanconi anemia, particularly in resource-limited settings given the high costs of HSCTs. Focused interventions in this subset of children help improve survival outcomes. Early identification of cytokine release syndrome and risk-adapted steroid therapy during engraftment helps prevent mortality. The concomitant use of NAC during cyclophosphamide infusion helps reduce oxygen free radical related tissue damage and regimen-related toxicity.",

Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed in chimeric populations of corrected and uncorrected HSPCs coexisting in the BM of gene therapy treated FA patients. Our study demonstrates that gene therapy reverts the transcriptional signature of FA HSPCs, which then resembles the transcriptional program of healthy donor HSPCs. This includes a downregulated expression of TGF-beta and p21, typically upregulated in FA HSPCs, and upregulation of DNA damage response and telomere maintenance pathways. Our results show for the first time the potential of gene therapy to rescue defects in the HSPC transcriptional program from patients with inherited diseases, in this case in FA characterized by BMF and cancer predisposition.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Fanconi anemia (FA) is an inherited disorder characterized clinically by congenital abnormalities, progressive bone marrow failure (BMF), and a predisposition to malignancy. Gene therapy (GT) of FA, via the infusion of gene-corrected peripheral blood (PB) autologous hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), may constitute a cure for BMF. GT bypasses the donor restrictions and adverse events associated with allogenic HSC transplantation. However, adequate harvesting of PB-HSCs is a crucial determinant of successful engraftment in gene therapy. Harvesting the low numbers of HSCs in patients with FA is particularly challenging. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This open-label phase I/II trial evaluates the feasibility and safety of co-administration of G-CSF and plerixafor in patients with FA for the mobilization and harvesting of peripheral HSCs, intending to use them in a gene therapy trial. Patients with mutations in the FANCA gene received two subcutaneous injections of G-CSF (6 mug/kg x 2/d from D1 to D8. Plerixafor (0.24 mg/kg/d) was administered 2 h before apheresis (from D5 onward). RESULTS: CD34+ cells were mobilized for four patients quickly but transiently after the plerixafor injection. One patient had a CD34+ cell count of over 100/mul; the mobilization peaked 2 h after the injection and lasted for more than 9 h. There were no short-term adverse events associated with the mobilization or harvesting procedures. CONCLUSION: Our data in patients with FA show that the mobilization of HSCs with G-CSF and plerixafor is safe and more efficient in younger individuals without BMF.",

We conducted this systematic review, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, to assess the long-term safety and clinical outcomes of GT in FA patients. Electronic searches from PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar were conducted and full texts of articles meeting our inclusion criteria were reviewed. Three clinical trials were included, with a total of nine patients and mean age of 10.7 +- 5.7 years. All patients had lentiviral-mediated GT. A 1-year follow-up showed stabilization in blood lineages, without any serious adverse effects from GT. A metaregression analysis could not be conducted, as very little long-term follow-up data of patients was observed, and the median survival rate could not be calculated. Thus, we can conclude that GT seems to be a safe procedure in FA; however, further research needs to be conducted on the longitudinal clinical effects of GT in FA, for a better insight into its potential to become a standard form of treatment.",

The available management strategies for these disorders are still unsatisfactory and do not eliminate the main causes. As genetic aberrations are the main causes of all forms of hereditary anemia, the optimal approach involves repairing the defective gene, possibly through the transplantation of normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from a normal matching donor or through gene therapy approaches (either in vivo or ex vivo) to correct the patient's HSCs. To clearly illustrate the importance of cell and gene therapy in hereditary anemia, this paper provides a review of the genetic aberration, epidemiology, clinical features, current management, and cell and gene therapy endeavors related to SCD, thalassemia, Fanconi anemia, and G6PDD. Moreover, we expound the future research direction of HSC derivation from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), strategies to edit HSCs, gene therapy risk mitigation, and their clinical perspectives. In conclusion, gene-corrected hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has promising outcomes for SCD, Fanconi anemia, and thalassemia, and it may overcome the limitation of the source of allogenic bone marrow transplantation.",

Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed in chimeric populations of corrected and uncorrected HSPCs coexisting in the BM of gene therapy treated FA patients. Our study demonstrates that gene therapy reverts the transcriptional signature of FA HSPCs, which then resembles the transcriptional program of healthy donor HSPCs. This includes a downregulated expression of TGF-beta and p21, typically upregulated in FA HSPCs, and upregulation of DNA damage response and telomere maintenance pathways. Our results show for the first time the potential of gene therapy to rescue defects in the HSPC transcriptional program from patients with inherited diseases, in this case in FA characterized by BMF and cancer predisposition.",

Corroborative human and murine studies point to a fetal origin of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) attrition under replicative stress. Along with intriguing recent insights into non-canonical roles and domain-specific functions of FA proteins, these studies have raised the possibility of a DNA repair-independent BMF etiology. However, deeper mechanistic insight is critical as current curative options of allogeneic stem cell transplantation and emerging gene therapy have limited eligibility, carry significant side effects, and involve complex procedures restricted to resource-rich environments. To develop rational and broadly accessible therapies for FA patients, the field will need more faithful disease models that overcome the scarcity of patient samples, leverage technological advances, and adopt investigational clinical trial designs tailored for rare diseases.",

We report the case of a patient with advanced gastric cancer, Fanconi anemia (FA), and primary biliary cholangitis. A 26-year-old woman visited a local physician complaining of epigastralgia. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed edematous changes with poor distension and circumferential thickened folds with erosions in the gastric body. Biopsy results of the lesion specimens revealed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed gastric wall with irregular thickness, several nodules in the peritoneal cavity, and a mass lesion in the right ovary. We diagnosed the patient with T4N2M1 stage IV gastric cancer accompanied by peritoneal and ovarian metastases and initiated nivolumab with S-1 plus oxaliplatin as the first-line treatment regimen. Because of immune-related adverse events after one course of systemic treatment, the regimen was changed to ramucirumab combined with nab-paclitaxel chemotherapy as the second-line treatment. After three cycles of weekly nab-paclitaxel with ramucirumab, the decreased platelet count did not recover, and her general condition gradually deteriorated. Comprehensive genome profiling using next-generation sequencing was performed to determine the feasibility of genotype-matched therapies. Alterations in FA complementation group A (FANCA) F1263del (49.1%) and E484Q (12.3%), which encode a key component of the multiprotein FA complex, were identified. The patient died 10 months after treatment initiation. In conclusion, when treating malignancies in adolescent and young adult patients, the genomic background should be considered.",

Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), the only potentially curative treatment for the hematological complications of FA, may precipitate acute kidney injury (AKI) and hypertension. We retrospectively investigated 107 FA patients who underwent HCT between 2009 and 2017. We investigated the incidence and risk factors of AKI within 100 days after HCT in a cohort of FA patients, and kidney function and hypertension over 2-year follow-up.The incidence of AKI (mainly stage I) was 18.7%. Patients aged >= 11 years at transplantation showed a higher risk of AKI (OR 3.53). The eGFR was 60-90 mL/min/1.73 m2 in 53 (49.5%), 55 (51.4%), 50 (50.5%), 50 (51%), and 46 (59.7%) patients before HCT, at 100 days, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years. Within the first 100 days after HCT, hypertension was observed in 72% of the patients and was associated with cyclosporine therapy. Most (62.3%) patients had stage 2 hypertension. CAKUT was observed in 33.7% of the patients and was associated with both hypertension (86%) and diminished kidney function but not with AKI.Conlusion: Although AKI, a commonly known HCT complication, was mild in this study, the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD), as well as the high incidence of hypertension, specially associated with CAKUT point out the importance of kidney care in short and long-term follow up of FA patients. What is Known:   Fanconi anemia (FA) is the most frequent inherited bone marrow failure in children, and 30% of cases have congenital anomalies of kidney (CAKUT).   Acute kidney injury and hypertension after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) may impact the outcomes.. What is New:   Despite the presence of CAKUT and stage 2 CKD in 33.7% and 50% of the patients, respectively, AKI was mild and transitory after HCT in FA patients.   CAKUT in FA patients was associated with lower kidney function and hypertension after HCT.",

Over the last two decades, HSCT outcomes have improved dramatically following the development of regimens tailored for FA patients. In this study, we analyzed genetic, clinical, and transplant data of 41 patients with FA who underwent HSCT at Hadassah Medical Center between November 1996 and September 2020. Overall survival (OS) was 82.9% with a median follow-up time of 2.11-years (95% CI, .48-16.56). Thirteen patients (31.7%) developed acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), three of them with grades 3-4. Nine patients developed chronic GVHD, five had extensive disease. Twelve patients (29.3%) developed stable mixed-chimerism with complete resolution of bone marrow failure (BMF); none of them had acute nor chronic GVHD. Significantly higher GVHD rates were observed in transplants from peripheral blood stem cell grafts as compared to other stem cell sources (p = .002 for acute and p = .004 for chronic GVHD). Outcome parameters were comparable between HSCT from matched-sibling (n = 20) to other donors (n = 21), including survival rates (p = .1), time to engraftment (p = .69 and p = .14 for neutrophil and platelet engraftment time, respectively), chimerism status (p = .36 and p = .83 for full-donor and mixed chimerism, respectively), and GVHD prevalence (p = 1). Our results demonstrate the vast improvements in HSCT outcomes of patients with FA, narrowing the gap between matched-sibling versus alternative donor transplantations. Our data identifies factors that may significantly affect transplant outcomes such as graft source and chimerism status.",

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative treatment for bone marrow failure and the hematologic malignancies these patients develop. Given the sensitivity of FA patients to chemotherapy and radiation, as to the clinical symptoms of graft versus host disease (GvHD), HSCT in these patients is challenging. Since the mid-nineties, HSCT for FA patients is performed in our center by using the fludarabine based reduced-intensity protocol. AIMS: To summarize the results of HSCT for patients with FA using a fludarabine based reduced-intensity conditioning regimen at the Hadassah Medical Center. METHODS: This retrospective research is based on the collection and analysis of clinical and laboratory data from the medical records of patients. RESULTS: Since June 1996 up till February 2020, 39 patients with FA underwent 43 HSCTs with a fludarabine based protocol at the Hadassah Medical Center. Four patients required a second transplant due to primary engraftment failure. Nine patients (23%) suffered from acute GvHD, four of them severe. Eight patients (20%) developed chronic GvHD, two with an extensive and debilitating disease. Thirty-three (85%) of the patients survived and six died, five shortly after the transplant, and one twenty years later from malignancy. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show high survival rates with low rates of engraftment failure and reasonable rates of GvHD. DISCUSSION: As of today, there is an effective and safe treatment for patients with FA who require HSCT by using a fludarabine-based reduced-intensity conditioning regimen, with high survival rates and few complications.",

The aim of our study is to evaluate the impact and benefits of allogenic matched donor HSCT in a case of a 12 year-old girl with FA, who displayed good clinical evolution following 2 months post-transplantation. METHODS: In the pre-transplant phase, reference blood samples from the donor and recipient were collected on EDTA. The DNA from blood samples was extracted using an automated Maxwell  48 RSC instrument (Promega, USA) with the Maxwell  RSC Whole blood DNA kit (Promega, USA). For DNA quantification, the PowerQuant System kit (Promega, USA) was used with the ABI 7500 Real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, USA). The amplification of the short tandem repeat markers was performed using the 24plex Investigator QS kit (Qiagen, Germany) on a ProFlex PCR System. Furthermore, the PCR products were separated and detected on an ABI 3500 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosytems, USA). RESULTS: Thirty days post transplantation, a complete chimerism (CC) was achieved with a full replacement by do-nor derived hematopoietic cells. Sixty days post transplantation, the CC status was maintained with improvement of hematological findings. CONCLUSIONS: In FA, chimerism monitoring after HSCT provides useful information regarding engraftment or possibility of post-transplantation complications such as graft versus host disease.",

Among 287 AA patients who excluded Fanconi anemia (FA), Congenital dyskeratosis (DKC), Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), etc.112 underwent matched sibling donor (MSD)-HSCT, 91 matched unrelated donor-HSCT and 84 haploidentical-HSCT. Patients were divided into the following 4 groups: group 1: Donor chimerism (DC); group 2: MC without cytopenia; group 3: MC with cytopenia; group 4: secondary graft failure (SGF). Compared with the other three groups, SGF predicted a poor prognosis of SAA (P< 0.001). In addition, SGF was associated with the early (within 3 months after transplantation) presence of MC and the high levels of MC. Uni- and multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that donor/recipient sex-mismatching and CTX + ATG regimen were high-risk factors for MC. Of note, in MC patients with cytopenia (group 3), the effective response rate reached 55% (6/11) following enhanced immunosuppression combined with cellular therapy, while only one of the four was effective who received enhanced immunosuppression alone. SGF was associated with poor prognosis, early presence of MC and increased levels of recipient chimerism. The donor/recipient sex-mismatching and CTX + ATG regimen based MSD-HSCT were risk factors for MC. Cellular therapy could improve the effective response rate of patients with progressive MC.",

                    "abstract": "Fanconi anemia (FA) is an inherited DNA repair disorder characterized by bone marrow (BM) failure, developmental abnormalities, myelodysplasia, and leukemia and solid tumor predisposition. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), a mainstay treatment, is limited by conditioning regimen-related toxicity and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Antibody-drug-conjugates (ADCs) targeting hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) can open marrow niches permitting donor stem cell alloengraftment. Here, we report that single dose anti-mouse CD45-targeted-ADC (CD45-ADC) facilitated stable, multilineage chimerism in 3 distinct FA mouse models representing 90% of FA complementation groups. CD45-ADC profoundly depleted host stem cell enriched Lineage Sca1+cKit+ cells within 48 hours. Fanca-/- recipients of minor-mismatched BM and single dose CD45-ADC had peripheral blood (PB) mean donor chimerism >90%; donor HSCs alloengraftment was verified in secondary recipients. In Fancc-/- and Fancg-/- recipients of fully allogeneic grafts, PB mean donor chimerism was 60-80% and 70-80%, respectively. The mean percent donor chimerism in BM and spleen mirrored PB results. CD45-ADC conditioned mice did not have clinical toxicity. A transient <2.5-fold increase in hepatocellular enzymes and mild-to-moderate histopathological changes were seen. Under GVHD allo-HSCT conditions, wildtype and Fanca-/- recipients of CD45-ADC had markedly reduced GVHD lethality compared to lethal irradiation. Moreover, single dose anti-human CD45-ADC given to rhesus macaque nonhuman primates on days -6 or -10 was at least as myeloablative as lethal irradiation. These data suggest that CD45-ADC can potently promote donor alloengraftment and hematopoiesis without significant toxicity or severe GVHD, as seen with lethal irradiation, providing strong support for clinical trial considerations in highly vulnerable FA patients.",

Impaired DNA repair including mutations in Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway genes are responsible for progression of many cancers. Nevertheless, FA-pathways genes have never been reported in myeloid cancers. Hence, this study was aimed to discover DNA repair genes associated with CML progression. AP-CML patients were subjected to whole exome sequencing along with appropriate controls. A novel splice site FANCD2 mutation was detected. FANCD2 is a well-known FA-pathway gene with established role in DNA repair. This is first report of FA-pathway DNA repair genes in myeloid cancers that can serve as a novel marker of CML progression to clinically intervene CML progression. Further studies are needed to establish the functional role of FANCD2 in CML progression that can provide novel insights into CML pathogenesis. This study also indicates that a combination TKIs and Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors like Olaparib (FDA approved anti-cancer drug for FA-pathway gene mutations) could improve the clinical outcome CML patients in accelerated and blast-crisis phases of the disease.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Fanconi anemia (FA) is a genetic disorder that impairs the function of the bone marrow and predisposes individuals to aplastic anemia. The condition is caused by mutations in genes responsible for DNA repair. People with FA have an increased risk of developing tumors due to DNA damage. Flat-cell carcinomas of the head, neck, esophagus, and genital organs are often observed in individuals with FA. CASE REPORT A 31-year-old man with Fanconi anemia and a history of bone marrow transplantation was admitted to the General Surgery Department due to elevated levels of the CEA marker. Before the transplantation, chromosomal anomalies, bone marrow hypoplasia, kidney agenesis, and bone defects were noted. After the transplantation, he developed a skin rash. He was also diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the lip and chronic conditions, including cholestatic liver damage, hypertension, and hypothyroidism. During the diagnostic process, computed tomography showed signs of Barrett's esophagus, numerous polyps in the stomach and intestines, and a nodular formation measuring 4.5x5x5.5 cm in the right iliac region. Laparoscopy revealed a neoplasm of the appendix with numerous metastases on the inner abdominal wall and omentum. Histological analysis confirmed mucinous appendiceal cancer. The patient was discharged for palliative treatment at the Oncology Center with a final diagnosis of appendiceal cancer, mucinous type, grade G3. This case underscores the importance of early and comprehensive cancer screening in individuals with FA, particularly those with a history of bone marrow transplantation. CONCLUSIONS This clinical case underscores the critical importance of thorough and timely cancer diagnosis in individuals with this genetic pathology.",

In 1988, Gluckman et al. reported the first successful matched sibling cord blood transplant (CBT) in a child with Fanconi Anemia. In 1991, Rubinstein et al. established an unrelated donor CB bank, and in 1993, the first unrelated CBT used a unit from this bank. Since that time, >40 000 CBTs have been performed worldwide. Early outcomes of CBT were mixed and demonstrated the importance of cell dose from the CB donor. We hypothesized that improvements in CB banking and transplantation favorably impacted outcomes of CBT today and performed a retrospective study combining data from Eurocord and Duke University in 4834 children transplanted with a single unrelated CB unit (CBU) from 1993 to 2019. Changes in standard transplant outcomes (overall survival [OS], disease free survival [DFS], acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease [GvHD], treatment related mortality [TRM], and relapse) over 3 time periods (1: <2005; 2: 2005 to <2010; and 3: >2010 to 2019) were studied. Increased cell dose and degree of HLA matching were observed over time. OS, times to engraftment, and DFS improved over time. The incidence of TRM and GvHD decreased while the incidence of relapse remained unchanged. Relative contributions of cell dose and HLA matching to transplant outcomes were also assessed and showed that HLA matching was more important than cell dose in this pediatric cohort.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) remains the only available curative treatment for Fanconi Anemia (FA), with particularly favorable outcomes reported after matched sibling donor (MSD) transplant. OBJECTIVES: To describe outcomes, with a special focus on late complications, in FA patients who underwent umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT). STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of allogeneic UCBT for FA performed between 1988 and 2021 in European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) affiliated centers. RESULTS: A total of 205 FA patients underwent UCBT (55 related and 150 unrelated) across 77 transplant centers. Indications for UCBT were bone marrow failure in 190 patients and acute leukemia/myelodysplasia in 15 patients. Median age at transplant was 9 (1.2-43) years, with only 20 patients over the age of 18. Among the donor-recipient pairs, 56% (n=116) had 0-1/6 HLA mismatch. Limited field radiotherapy was administered to 28% (n=58) and 78% (n=160) received a Fludarabine (FLU)-based conditioning regimen. Serotherapy consisted of anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG, n=159; 78%) or alemtuzumab (n=12; 6%). Median follow-up was 10 years for related and 7 years for unrelated UCBT. Excellent outcomes were observed in the setting of related UCBT, including a 60-day cumulative incidence (CI) of neutrophil recovery at 98.1% (93.9-100), a 100-day CI of grades II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) at 17.3% (9.5-31.6), and a 5-year CI of chronic GVHD at 22.7% (13.3-38.7; 13% extensive). Five-year overall survival (OS) was 88%. In multivariate analysis, none of the factors included in the model predicted a better OS. In unrelated UCBT, the 60-day CI of neutrophil recovery was 78.7% (71.9-86.3), the 100-day CI of grade II-IV aGVHD was 31.4% (24.6-40.2) and the 5-year CI of cGVHD was 24.3% (17.8-32.2) (12% extensive). Five-year OS was 44%. In multivariate analysis, negative recipient CMV serology, FLU-based conditioning, age at UCBT less than 9 years and 0-1/6 HLA mismatch were associated with improved OS. A total of 106 patients, including 5 AL/MDS, survived for over 2 years after UCBT. Nine of these patients developed subsequent neoplasms (SN), including one donor-derived AML and 8 solid tumors, at a median of 9.7 (2.3-21.8) years post-UCBT (one related and 8 unrelated UCBT). In a subset of 49 patients with available data, late non-malignant complications affecting various organ systems were observed at a median of 8.7 (2.7-28.8) years post-UCBT. CONCLUSION: UCB is a valid source of stem cells for transplantation in patients with FA, with best results observed after related UCBT. After unrelated UCBT, improved survival was observed in patients transplanted at a younger age, with FLU-based conditioning and better HLA parity. The incidence of organ specific complications and subsequent neoplasms was relatively low. Subsequent neoplasm incidence, mostly squamous cell carcinoma, increases with time. Rigorous follow-up and life-long screening is crucial in Fanconi anemia patients transplant survivors. The long-term complications observed emphasize the need for long-life screening of transplant survivors.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) remains the only available curative treatment for Fanconi Anemia (FA), with particularly favorable outcomes reported after matched sibling donor (MSD) transplant. OBJECTIVES: To describe outcomes, with a special focus on late complications, in FA patients who underwent umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT). STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of allogeneic UCBT for FA performed between 1988 and 2021 in European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) affiliated centers. RESULTS: A total of 205 FA patients underwent UCBT (55 related and 150 unrelated) across 77 transplant centers. Indications for UCBT were bone marrow failure in 190 patients and acute leukemia/myelodysplasia in 15 patients. Median age at transplant was 9 (1.2-43) years, with only 20 patients over the age of 18. Among the donor-recipient pairs, 56% (n=116) had 0-1/6 HLA mismatch. Limited field radiotherapy was administered to 28% (n=58) and 78% (n=160) received a Fludarabine (FLU)-based conditioning regimen. Serotherapy consisted of anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG, n=159; 78%) or alemtuzumab (n=12; 6%). Median follow-up was 10 years for related and 7 years for unrelated UCBT.
