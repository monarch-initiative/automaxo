31235532	TransCon CNP, a Sustained-Release C-Type Natriuretic Peptide Prodrug, a Potentially Safe and Efficacious New Therapeutic Modality for the Treatment of Comorbidities Associated with Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 3-Related Skeletal Dysplasias.	TransCon CNP is a C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP-38) conjugated via a cleavable linker to a polyethylene glycol carrier molecule, designed to provide sustained systemic CNP levels upon weekly subcutaneous administration. TransCon CNP is in clinical development for the treatment of comorbidities associated with achondroplasia. In both mice and cynomolgus monkeys, sustained exposure to CNP via TransCon CNP was more efficacious in stimulating bone growth than intermittent CNP exposure. TransCon CNP was well tolerated with no adverse cardiovascular effects observed at exposure levels exceeding the expected clinical therapeutic exposure. At equivalent dose levels, reductions in blood pressure and/or an increase in heart rate were seen following single subcutaneous injections of the unconjugated CNP-38 molecule or a daily CNP-39 molecule (same amino acid sequence as Vosoritide, USAN:INN). The half-life of the daily CNP-39 molecule in cynomolgus monkey was estimated to be 20 minutes, compared with 90 hours for CNP-38, released from TransCon CNP. C max for the CNP-39 molecule (20 microg/kg) was approximately 100-fold higher, compared with the peak CNP level associated with administration of 100 microg/kg CNP as TransCon CNP. Furthermore, CNP exposure for the daily CNP-39 molecule was only evident for up to 2 hours postdose (lower limit of quantification 37 pmol/l), whereas TransCon CNP gave rise to systemic exposure to CNP-38 for at least 7 days postdose. The prolonged CNP exposure and associated hemodynamically safe peak serum concentrations associated with TransCon CNP administration are suggested to improve efficacy, compared with short-lived CNP molecules, due to better therapeutic drug coverage and decreased risk of hypotension. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The hormone C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) is in clinical development for the treatment of comorbidities associated with achondroplasia, the most common form of human dwarfism. The TransCon Technology was used to design TransCon CNP, a prodrug that slowly releases active CNP in the body over several days. Preclinical data show great promise for TransCon CNP to be an effective and well-tolerated drug that provides sustained levels of CNP in a convenient once-weekly dose, while avoiding high systemic CNP bolus concentrations that can induce cardiovascular side effects.
38564174	Bariatric Surgery in Patients with Achondroplasia, a Feasibility Study of Two Case Studies.	BACKGROUND: Achondroplasia is a common skeletal dysplasia with a high prevalence of obesity in adulthood. Bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective in treating obesity and related comorbidities, but its feasibility and effectiveness in patients with achondroplasia have not been clearly established. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of bariatric surgery in patients with achondroplasia. SETTING: This study was performed in France, and bariatric surgeons from the Societe Francaise et Francophone de Chirurgie de l'Obesite et des Maladies Metaboliques (French Francophone Society of Surgery for Obesity or Metabolic Diseases) were asked to participate. METHODS: Two adult women with confirmed achondroplasia and a high BMI were selected for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. Preoperative data were collected, including demographic information, comorbidities, and follow-up at 1, 3, and 6 months and 1 year after surgery. Complications were monitored and recorded. RESULTS: Both patients had good excess weight loss outcomes, with an average excess weight loss of 60.5% 1 year after surgery. One patient had a follow-up of 3 years and an excess weight loss of 44%. The surgery was well-tolerated, and no major complications were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Bariatric surgery is feasible and effective in patients with achondroplasia, with good outcomes for excess weight loss and related comorbidities. These findings suggest that bariatric surgery should be considered a treatment option for patients with achondroplasia and obesity.
36280609	Plate fixation after lengthening with an external fixator in patients with achondroplasia : A comparative study between two centers.	BACKGROUND: This study compared internal fixation with a plate after lengthening (PAL) with an external fixator with the conventional method (CM) in terms of radiologic and clinical outcomes in the lower extremities of patients with achondroplasia. METHODS: In this study 20 patients (50 lower extremity long bones) who underwent PAL or CM were divided into 2 cohort groups. The amount of lengthening, percentage lengthening, external fixator index (EFI), external fixator time, Li regeneration index, complication rate, and knee range of motion (ROM) were compared between the groups. RESULTS: The median age was 9.4 years (range 6-16 years) in the PAL group and 12 years (range 9-16 years) in the CM group (p = 0.01). Males comprised 80% of the patients in the PAL group and 47% of the patients in the CM group (p = 0.02). The median amount of lengthening in the PAL and CM groups was 7.5 cm (range 5.5-9.5 cm) and 6.0 cm (range 5.5-9.0 cm), respectively (p < 0.01). The median percentage of lengthening in the PAL and CM groups was 44.6% (range 20.0-70.1%) and 43.0% (range 20.5-57.3%), respectively (p = 0.01). The median external fixator time in the PAL and CM groups was 127 days (range 94-185 days) and 180 days (range 105-355 days), respectively (p < 0.01). The median EFI in the PAL and CM groups was 21 days/cm (range 10-33 days/cm) and 27 days/cm (range 15-59 days/cm), respectively (p < 0.01). The Li regeneration index was 3 (interquartile range, IQR 2-4) in both groups (p = 0.2). The total complication rate was similar between the groups. CONCLUSION: In patients with achondroplasia, after lengthening with an external fixator, internal fixation with a plate can be a reliable alternative to the conventional method. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III therapeutic.
22472460	Atlanto-axial instability in achondroplastic dwarfs: a report of two cases and literature review.	BACKGROUND: Achondroplasia is the commonest form of human dwarfism. The authors report atlanto-axial instability, in consequence to os odontoideum in this subgroup of patients. METHODS: Two achondroplastic dwarfs harboring atlanto-axial dislocation are described along with radiological findings. RESULTS: Both children underwent successful internal rigid immobilization, using sublaminar atlanto-axial wiring. CONCLUSIONS: Craniovertebral junction instability should be evaluated among these children, whenever foramen magnum insufficiency is being considered.
32282831	Pharmacokinetics and safety after once and twice a day doses of meclizine hydrochloride administered to children with achondroplasia.	Achondroplasia (ACH) is the most common short-limbed skeletal dysplasia caused by activating mutations in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene. We identified that meclizine hydrochloride inhibited FGFR3 signaling in various chondrocytic cells and promoted longitudinal bone growth in mouse model of ACH. Meclizine has safely been used for more than 50 years, but it lacks the safety data for repeated administration and pharmacokinetics (PK) when administered to children. We performed a phase Ia study to evaluate the PK and safety of meclizine administered orally to ACH children. Twelve ACH children aged from 5 to younger than 11 years were recruited, and the first 6 subjects received once a day of meclizine in the fasted condition, subsequent 6 subjects received twice a day of meclizine in the fed condition. Meclizine was well tolerated in ACH children with no serious adverse events. The mean Cmax, Tmax, AUC0-24h, t1/2 during 24 hours in the fasted condition were 130 ng/mL, 1.7 hours, 761 ng h/mL, and 8.5 hours respectively. The simulation of repeated administration of meclizine for 14 days demonstrated that plasma concentration apparently reached steady state around 10 days after the first dose both at once a day and twice a day administration. The AUC0-10h of the fasting and fed condition were 504 ng h/mL and 813 ng h/mL, respectively, indicating exposure of meclizine increased with the diet. Although higher drug exposure was confirmed in ACH children compared to adults, a single administration of meclizine seemed to be well tolerated.
38084006	Prophylactic Intramedullary Rodding After Femoral Lengthening in Patients With Achondroplasia and Hypochondroplasia.	BACKGROUND: Femoral fracture after femoral lengthening in patients with achondroplasia and hypochondroplasia is a frequent complication, occurring in up to 30%. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the effectiveness of prophylactic intramedullary rodding in preventing this complication. METHODS: Multicenter retrospective study involving 86 femoral lengthening procedures in 43 patients with achondroplasia or hypochondroplasia. Forty-two femora (21 patients) were prophylactically managed with intramedullary Rush rodding after external fixation removal (11 females and 10 males, mean age 14.6 years) compared with 44 femora (22 patients) without prophylactic intramedullary rodding (13 females and 9 males, mean age 15.2 years). The mean amount of lengthening in the rodding group was 13.3 cm (52.6%) with an External Fixation Index of 25.8 days/cm; in patients without rodding was 14.3 cm (61.5%) and 24.5 days/cm, respectively. RESULTS: Seven cases (15.9%) without rodding developed fractures. Four of them required surgical correction due to displacement or shortening. Only 1 patient (2.4%) had fracture of the femur after prophylactic rodding, and surgery was not required. The incidence of femur fracture was significantly lower in the prophylactic rodding group compared with the nonrodding group (2.4% vs. 15.9%, respectively; P =0.034). There were no cases of infection or avascular necrosis. CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic intramedullary rodding is a safe and effective method for preventing femoral fractures after femoral lengthening in patients with achondroplasia or hypochondroplasia. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III-a retrospective comparative study.
28501952	Final adult height in long-term growth hormone-treated achondroplasia patients.	The objective of this study was to evaluate the gain in final height of achondroplasia (ACH) patients with long-term growth hormone (GH) treatment. We analyzed medical data of 22 adult patients (8 males and 14 females) treated with GH at a dose of 0.05 mg/kg/day. Optionally, tibial lengthening (TL) was performed with the Ilizalov method in 15 patients and TL as well as femoral lengthening (FL) in 6 patients. Concomitant gonadal suppression therapy with buserelin acetate was applied in 13 patients. The mean treatment periods with GH were 10.7 +- 4.0 and 9.3 +- 2.5 years for males and females, respectively. GH treatment augmented the final height +0.60 +- 0.52 SD (+3.5 cm) and +0.51 +- 1.29 SD (+2.8 cm) in males and females compared to non-treated ACH patients, respectively. Final height of ACH patients that underwent GH and TL increased +1.72 +- 0.72 SD (+10.0 cm) and +1.95 +- 1.34 SD (+9.8 cm) in males and females, respectively. GH, TL, and FL increased their final height +2.97 SD (+17.2 cm) and +3.41 +- 1.63 SD (+17.3 cm) in males and females, respectively. Gonadal suppression therapy had no impact on final height. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term GH treatment contributes to 2.6 and 2.1% of final adult height in male and female ACH patients, respectively.
29512530	[Homeostasis and Disorder of Musculoskeletal System.Diagnosis and Treatment of Congenital Musculoskeletal Diseases.]	Congenital skeletal dysplasias have been considered to be fundamentally untreatable diseases. However, molecular diagnosis by genetic testing has become more prevalent, and efforts are being made to develop novel therapies based on the pathogenesis. As treatments for osteogenesis imperfecta, in addition to anti-resorptive agents, neutralizing antibodies against sclerostin and transforming growth factor(TGF)-beta and chemical chaperones can be beneficial. Enzyme replacement therapy using bone-targeting recombinant alkaline phosphatase has been recently developed to treat hypophosphatasia and has much improved the prognosis of the patients affected with severe forms of the disease. To treat the severe short stature in achondroplasia, drugs targeting the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3(FGFR3)-mediated signal are in development for clinical use.
21225389	Hypochondroplasia due to FGFR3 gene mutation (N540K) and mosaic form of Down syndrome in the same patient.	The simultaneous presence of Down syndrome and achondroplasia has rarely been reported in the literature, and our search revealed only six patients with such an association. We are reporting the first case of a patient with Down syndrome and hypochondroplasia. In this patient, Down syndrome was clinically recognised and confirmed by the cytogenetic finding of mosaic karyotype (47,XX,+21/46,XX) shortly after birth. She was subsequently diagnosed with hypochondroplasia at the age of 6 years when disproportional short stature, stocky habitus and macrocephaly were observed. These phenotypic findings were later confirmed by the presence of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene mutation N540K. The overlapping common clinical features of Down syndrome and hypochondroplasia resulted in delayed diagnosis of hypochondroplasia in our patient and the associated deleterious effect on her linear growth. Her final height is 126.5 cm, which is -3.76 standard deviations (SD) lower than the median height in patients with Down syndrome, and is under the lower borderline of the adult height range for women with hypochondroplasia.
34454631	Targeted gene correction and functional recovery in achondroplasia patient-derived iPSCs.	BACKGROUND: Achondroplasia (ACH) is the most common genetic form of dwarfism and belongs to dominant monogenic disorder caused by a gain-of-function point mutation in the transmembrane region of FGFR3. There are no effective treatments for ACH. Stem cells and gene-editing technology provide us with effective methods and ideas for ACH research and treatment. METHODS: We generated non-integrated iPSCs from an ACH girl's skin and an ACH boy's urine by Sendai virus. The mutation of ACH iPSCs was precisely corrected by CRISPR-Cas9. RESULTS: Chondrogenic differentiation ability of ACH iPSCs was confined compared with that of healthy iPSCs. Chondrogenic differentiation ability of corrected ACH iPSCs could be restored. These corrected iPSCs displayed pluripotency, maintained normal karyotype, and demonstrated none of off-target indels. CONCLUSIONS: This study may provide an important theoretical and experimental basis for the ACH research and treatment.
20803866	Intraoperative airway obstruction related to tracheostomy tube malposition in a patient with achondroplasia and Jeune's syndrome.	A 14 year-old adolescent with achondroplasia and Jeune's syndrome (asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy) presented for cervical spine surgery in the prone position. Due to the need for home mechanical ventilation at night, the patient had a tracheostomy in place. With the first surgical procedure, the cuffed tracheostomy tube was left in place during prone positioning. Difficulties encountered with ventilation through the cuffed tracheostomy tube in the prone position necessitated aborting the case. During three subsequent surgeries, the tracheostomy tube was removed and an armored endotracheal tube was placed through the tracheostomy stoma prior to prone positioning. No further difficulties with ventilation were noted with the subsequent cases. There are currently no guidelines in the medical literature regarding perioperative management of patients with a tracheostomy requiring prone positioning for surgery. The management of such patients is reviewed and possible problems with tracheostomy positioning during prone positioning are explored. Given such issues, we would suggest removal of the tracheostomy tube and placement of an armored endotracheal tube through the stoma during surgical procedures in the prone position.
38604940	Exploring the family experience of children aged 2-4 years receiving daily vosoritide injections: A qualitative study.	PURPOSE: Vosoritide is administered as a daily subcutaneous injection in children with achondroplasia. In clinical trials, families of children aged 2-4 years reported difficulty with drug administration due to child fear, pain, and distress. Study aims were to gain a better understanding of the current vosoritide administration experience in this cohort and to investigate whether topical anaesthesia and ice application prior to injections improved the child and family experience. DESIGN AND METHODS: A qualitative descriptive study design ensured in-depth understanding of family experience. Parents were interviewed to explore experience of vosoritide administration for their child at two time points, before (Phase 1) and after (Phase 2) the introduction of topical anaesthesia and ice application prior to injections. Interviews were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Seven families participated. Children's ages ranged from 2 years 2 months to 3 years 11 months. Five themes emerged from data analysis: (1) The reality of the burden of care; (2) Child experience as the greatest obstacle; (3) Parents juggle multiple emotional considerations; (4) Many factors may impact experience; and (5) Short-term and long-term impacts. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of vosoritide in this cohort presents multiple challenges for families. Factors which influenced experience differed between families. Responses to topical anaesthesia and ice application also varied between children, improving administration experience for some children and worsening experience for others. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: This study highlights the need for individualised care for young children receiving daily injections. Support should be provided to families to identify factors that improve experience.

28906337	A Three-Dimensional Study of Midfacial Changes Following Le Fort II Distraction With Zygomatic Repositioning in Syndromic Patients.	Le Fort II distraction with zygomatic repositioning introduced the ability to restore central midfacial height and convexity independent of changes in orbital morphology. This study analyzes midfacial and orbital morphology before and after Le Fort II distraction with zygomatic repositioning.All patients who underwent Le Fort II Distraction with zygomatic repositioning between 2013 and 2015 were included. Two- and 3-dimensional measurements were made using 3dMD Vultus software to assess canthal tilt, nasolabial angle, ratio of midfacial to lower facial height, and absolute change in nasal length. Presence of an open bite and Angle classification were assessed before and after surgery.Four patients underwent segmental midface advancement using Le Fort II distraction with zygomatic repositioning. Associated diagnoses included Apert syndrome, Goldenhar syndrome, and achondroplasia. Changes in facial dimensions included: 3.19  improvement in canthal tilt (range -4.7  to 8.4 ), 9  change in nasolabial angle (range -1.0  to 19 ), and 0.69 cm increase in absolute nasal length (range 0.2-0.94 cm). Mean ratio of midfacial to lower facial height was 0.79 preoperatively and 0.89 postoperatively. Preoperatively, all patients demonstrated Angle class III with 3 of 4 patients demonstrating anterior open bite. All achieved closure of open bite and demonstrated class I or II occlusion. No complications were observed.Le Fort II distraction with zygomatic repositioning resulted in normalization of midfacial soft tissue landmarks. This form of advancement demonstrates the ability to selectively improve midfacial height and canthal tilt while restoring normal occlusion.
30825321	An audit on a routine antenatal nonstress testing program in pregnant women with preexisting diabetes.	INTRODUCTION: The objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of routine (planned) antenatal nonstress tests (NSTs) in pregnant women with preexisting diabetes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective single-center study of 642 consecutive pregnancies in women with preexisting diabetes who gave birth to a singleton >=22 weeks. Weekly planned NSTs were commenced at 33-35 weeks. In pregnancies with maternal-fetal complications, the initiation and frequency of the planned NST were individualized. Daily maternal assessment of fetal activity was recommended from 28 weeks, and decreased fetal activity indicated an unplanned NST. Data were collected from medical records, and local and regional databases. RESULTS: In total, 3016 planned NSTs were performed, with a median of five (range 0-12) tests per pregnancy. Ninety-five planned NSTs (3.1%) were abnormal, a finding confirmed by retesting the same day in eight cases (8.4%), thus leading to delivery. Complications were present in seven of these eight pregnancies, whereas no fetal movements for the last 3 days were reported when the planned NST was performed in the eighth pregnancy. When specifically asked, five of the eight women stated that they had observed decreased fetal activity preceding the planned NST. In 86 pregnancies (13.4%), maternal perception of decreased fetal activity indicated in total 127 unplanned NSTs. The combination of decreased fetal activity and further obstetrical assessment led to delivery in 10 of these pregnancies (11.6%). One stillbirth occurred at 37 weeks in a pregnancy complicated by fetal achondroplasia and polyhydramnios, where the weekly planned NSTs had been normal. The overall stillbirth rate was thus 1.6/1000. CONCLUSIONS: Routine use of planned antenatal NSTs does not appear to be indicated in pregnancies in women with preexisting diabetes in the absence of maternal-fetal complications.
35134778	[MATHEMATICAL MODELING OF OPTIONS FOR MOUNTING AN EXTERNAL FIXATION DEVICE ON THE TIBIA DURING ITS LENGTHENING].	The main problem in the treatment of axial deformities and limb shortening in pediatric orthopedics is the presence of incomplete growth of the patient, which gives an unfavorable basis for the achieved correction. The most advanced technology for the treatment of deformities and limb shortening is the use of external fixation devices (AVF). Target. To study the stress-strain state of the "tibia-AVF model with different variants of AVF mounting in conditions of tibia lengthening. Mathematical modeling of tibial osteosynthesis with external fixation devices in children with achondroplasia was carried out. The model of the distal end of the lower limb contained both lower leg bones and bony elements of the foot. Two variants of the AVF imposition were modeled: with the arrangement of all rods in the same plane, and according to the scheme with a V-shaped arrangement of the rods in the proximal tibia. The values of maximum stresses and values of relative deformations in the elements of the models were investigated. Sweat is a compressive load, the zone of maximum stress (66.8 MPa) in the bone tissue occurs around the upper rod. The smallest stresses (22.8 MPa) are observed around the fourth bar. On the second and third rods, the stresses are the same - 41.6 and 41.5 MPa, respectively. The V-shaped arrangement of the rods leads to a decrease in stresses around the first rod to 57.2 MPa. The stresses in the distal part of the proximal tibia fragment do not exceed 35.5 MPa. Under torsional loads in the model with parallel arrangement of rods, the zone of maximum stresses arises around the first rod (16.3 MPa). The stresses in the distal fragment of the tibia are determined in the range from 1.2 to 3.9 MPa on the lower and upper rods, respectively. The use of an AVF with a V-shaped arrangement of the rods causes stresses in the tibia at a level of 13.1 MPa on the first rod, a minimum 1.1 MPa on the fourth. When the model is compressed with a parallel arrangement of the AVF rods, the values of relative deformations in the bone regenerate are determined in the range from 62 to 85%. The use of the AVF according to the scheme with a V-shaped arrangement of the rods makes it possible to reduce the magnitude of the relative deformations to the level of 77%. In the model with a parallel arrangement of the AVF rods, the relative deformations in the bone regenerate under torsional loads are determined in the range from 3.0 to 6.0%. When using AVF with a V-shaped arrangement of rods, the level of relative deformations is determined in the range from 1.0 to 4.0%. The use of an AVF with a V-shaped arrangement of rods in the lower part of the proximal fragment of the tibia during its osteosynthesis allows reducing the level of stresses at all control points of the model for all types of loading, as compared to the model of an AVF with a parallel arrangement of rods. AVF with a V-shaped arrangement of the rods makes it possible to reduce the values of the relative deformations of the bone regenerate at all the studied control points of the models, both under compression and torsion loads.
37728398	Neurosurgical management of cervicomedullary compression, spinal stenosis, and hydrocephalus in pediatric achondroplasia: a systematic review.	OBJECTIVE: Pediatric achondroplasia is often associated with conditions requiring neurosurgical intervention, including CSF diversion and multilevel spinal decompression. However, there is a lack of clinical guidelines and reliable estimates of the benefits and risks of these interventions. This study aimed to summarize the literature on the neurosurgical management of pediatric achondroplasia patients in order to aid in determining optimal treatment and standardization of care. METHODS: A systematic review of peer-reviewed studies with an objective diagnosis of achondroplasia, patient demographic information, and available data on neurosurgical interventions performed before 18 years of age for cervicomedullary compression, spinal stenosis, and hydrocephalus was performed. Study quality and risks of bias were assessed using standardized scores. Independent patient data on surgical indications, outcomes, reoperations, and complication risks were aggregated using means and percentages. RESULTS: Of 204 records, 25 studies with 287 pediatric achondroplasia patients (mean age 25 +- 36 months) treated for cervicomedullary compression (n = 153), spinal stenosis (n = 100), and obstructive hydrocephalus (n = 34) were evaluated. Symptomatic cervicomedullary compression occurred early in life (mean age 31 +- 25 months), with apnea (48%), T2-weighted MRI cord signal (28%), myelopathy (27%), and delayed motor skills (15%) requiring foramen magnum decompression observed in 99% of patients, as well as cervical laminectomy in 65% of patients. Although 91% of treated patients had resolution of symptoms, 2% mortality, 9% reoperation, and 21% complication rates were reported. Spinal stenosis was treated in relatively older children (mean age 13 +- 3 years) with laminectomy (23%), as well as with instrumented fusion (73%) for neurogenic claudication (59%), back pain (15%), and sciatica (8%). Although 95% of patients had symptom resolution after surgery, 17% reported complications and 18% required reoperation. Of the hydrocephalus patients (mean age 56 +- 103 months), half were treated with endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) and half had a shunt placed for progressive ventriculomegaly (66%), headaches (32%), and delayed cognitive development (4%). The shunted patients had a 3% mortality rate and an average of 1.5 shunt revisions per patient. None of the patients who underwent ETV as the primary procedure required a revision. CONCLUSIONS: Neurosurgical intervention for pediatric achondroplasia conditions, including cervicomedullary compression, spinal stenosis, and hydrocephalus, is associated with high recovery rates and good outcomes. However, complications and reoperations are common. Further studies with follow-up into adulthood are needed to evaluate the long-term outcomes.
38730409	Management of complete intra-articular distal femur and patellar fractures in an achondroplastic young adult; small is challenging' revisited: a case-report.	BACKGROUND: People with achondroplasia exhibit distinct physical characteristics, but their cognitive abilities remain within the normal range. The challenges encountered during surgical procedures and perioperative care for achondroplastic individuals, are underrepresented in the existing literature. CASE PRESENTATION: In this report, the management of a 26-year-old North-African achondroplastic male is highlighted. The patient suffered a complete intra-articular distal femur fracture (AO/OTA 33-C1) and an ipsilateral patella fracture (AO/OTA 34-C1). The patient's unusual anatomical variations and the lack of suitable orthopedic implants posed significant surgical challenges, particularly in the context of a resource-limited developing country. Facial and spinal deformities, which are common in patients with achondroplasia, further complicated the anesthetic approach. CONCLUSIONS: The limited information on operative management of fractures in achondroplastic patients necessitated independent decision-making and diverging from the convenient approach where clear guidance is available in the literature.
39283673	Musculoskeletal Issues in Children and Adolescents: Genetic Musculoskeletal Disorders.	Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked recessive genetic disorder with progressive proximal weakness as the principal sign. Glucocorticoids and physical therapy are the mainstay of treatment. Exercise intolerance is the hallmark of metabolic myopathies, which require a combination of laboratory testing, electrodiagnostic testing, and muscle biopsy for diagnosis. Joint hypermobility may be an isolated finding or be associated with hypermobility Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), other variants of EDS, or marfanoid syndromes. The latter conditions are associated with aortic and cardiac valvular abnormalities. Osteogenesis imperfecta encompasses a group of disorders characterized by bone fragility presenting with a low-impact fracture as a result of minimal trauma. Management includes multidiscipline specialists. Down syndrome (DS), or trisomy 21, is the most common chromosome abnormality identified in live births. Routine evaluation of atlantoaxial instability with x-ray is no longer recommended for children with DS without symptoms of atlantoaxial instability; however, clinical evaluation of symptoms is required for sports preparticipation. Achondroplasia is the most common skeletal dysplasia. Clinical signs are macrocephaly, short limb, short stature with disproportionately shorter humerus and femur, along with characteristic findings in pelvis and lumbar spine x-rays. Caregivers should be educated on proper positioning and handling to avoid complications, including car seat-related deaths.
34333511	Multilevel thoracic and lumbar ligamentum flavum ossification in an achondroplasic-a rare presentation.	INTRODUCTION: Achondroplasia is a rare autosomal dominant condition characterized by stenosis in spinal canal. Multilevel Ossification of the ligamentum flavum in the spine is a rare occurrence which too can contribute to stenosed canal. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of an Indian achondroplasic dwarf with multilevel ossification of ligamentum flavum (OLF) at thoracic and lumbar segment. She presented in the outpatient department with bilateral weakness in legs with complete foot drop on the left side and was non-ambulatory. She was managed surgically by instrumentation with multiple interbody fusions with wide decompression and excision of OLF. The patient responded well to the surgery and became a walker after 2-year follow-up. DISCUSSION: Achondroplasic patients may present rarely with multiregional and multilevel OLF. It is important to identify them preoperatively so as to have good surgical outcome. Wide laminectomy, removal of the ossified ligament, and fusion with instrumentation resulted in the improvement of the patient's neurological symptoms and functions.

30277952	Achondroplasia: Orocraniofacial Features and Orthodontic-Surgical Management Guidelines Proposal.	In this study, the authors aimed to describe orocraniofacial features and to suggest orthodontic-surgical managements in achondroplasia, based on a literature review. The authors focused on skeletal and dentoalveolar malocclusion in order to highlight the place of orthognathic surgery, based on our experience of 3 patients. Maxillary hypoplasia in achondroplasia typically results in an Angle class III malocclusion with an anterior open bite. The other orocraniofacial features include enlarged calvarium, prominent forehead and frontal bossing, midface hypoplasia, elongated lower face and saddle-shaped nose due to lack of development of the nasomaxillary complex.All our patients had a typical facial appearance but each of them had their own particularities regarding medical history and severity of the dentoskeletal dysmorphosis. Two of them were successfully treated by orthognathic surgery; the other declined surgical treatment and underwent orthopedic treatment only (anchorage plates). The treatment failure of this 3rd patient raises the question of the efficiency of anchorage plates in achondroplasia. In the light of the literature and our results, the authors conclude the need for personalized management based on age, medical history, severity of the dentoskeletal dysmorphosis, functional and/or esthetic disorders, and the patient's needs and requests. In any patient, orthodontic management should be initiated at an early age, and orthognathic surgery modalities should be personalized and adapted to each situation.
33761804	Rationale, design, and methods of a randomized, controlled, open-label clinical trial with open-label extension to investigate the safety of vosoritide in infants, and young children with achondroplasia at risk of requiring cervicomedullary decompression surgery.	Achondroplasia causes narrowing of the foramen magnum and the spinal canal leading to increased mortality due to cervicomedullary compression in infants and significant morbidity due to spinal stenosis later in adulthood. Vosoritide is a C-natriuretic peptide analogue that has been shown to improve endochondral ossification in children with achondroplasia. The objective of this trial is to evaluate the safety of vosoritide and whether vosoritide can improve the growth of the foramen magnum and spinal canal in children that may require decompression surgery. An Achondroplasia Foramen Magnum Score will be used to identify infants at risk of requiring decompression surgery. This is a 2-year open label randomized controlled trial of vosoritide in infants with achondroplasia ages 0 to <=12 months. Approximately 20 infants will be randomized 1:1 to either open label once daily subcutaneous vosoritide combined with standard of care or standard of care alone. The primary and secondary aims of the study are to evaluate the safety and efficacy of vosoritide in children with cervicomedullary compression at risk of requiring decompression surgery. The trial will be carried out in specialized skeletal dysplasia treatment centers with well established multidisciplinary care pathways and standardized approaches to the neurosurgical management of cervicomedually compression. After 2 years, infants randomized to standard of care alone will be eligible to switch to vosoritide plus standard of care for an additional 3 years. This pioneering trial hopes to address the important question as to whether treatment with vosoritide at an early age in infants at risk of requiring cervicomedullary decompression surgery is safe, and can improve growth at the foramen magnum and spinal canal alleviating stenosis. This in turn may reduce compression of surrounding structures including the neuraxis and spinal cord, which could alleviate future morbidity and mortality.Trial registrations: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04554940; EudraCT number, 2020-001055-40.
33560708	Upper Limb Lengthening in Achondroplasia Using Unilateral External Fixation.	PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to analyze the long-term results of humeral lengthening in achondroplastic patients and make suggestions on the most appropriate surgical technique to improve patient outcomes. METHODS: Fifty-four humeral lengthening procedures performed in 27 achondroplastic patients were reviewed. Elongations were performed by means of callotasis with unilateral external fixation. Inclusion criteria were: achondroplastic patients under 17 years without prior arm operations and minimum follow-up of 36 months. RESULTS: Fifty humeri in 25 patients (13 men and 12 women), aged between 9 and 17 years, met the inclusion criteria. Mean humeral lengthening was 8.82 cm (range: 5 to 10.5 cm), which represented an elongation of 54.80% (range: 46% to 63%) of the original length. The healing index was 0.91 months (range: 0.72 to 1.4 mo) per centimeter gained. Shoulder and elbow range of motion and stability were preserved in 47 limbs. Noncomplicated cases consistently experienced a significant functional improvement in the performance of activities of daily living such as putting on footwear and personal hygiene. Short-term complications included 11 pin-tract infections, 1 radial nerve neuropraxia, and 1 failure of the regenerated bone formation. None of these complications prevented from completion of treatment. Long-term complications included 2 cases of nonunion, 3 elbow flexion contractures, and 2 cases of psychological dissatisfaction, all of them in 4 patients. Factors associated with long-term complications were intraoperative fragment displacement and distal humeral osteotomy. No fractures of the regenerated bone were identified in the long term. CONCLUSIONS: Callotasis with unilateral external fixation is a reliable and well-tolerated procedure for humeral lengthening in achondroplastic patients, with an acceptable complication rate. Guided fixator placement and a proximal humeral osteotomy are strongly recommended technical tips as they may help prevent complications and improve outcomes. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV-case series.
30444751	Mesenchymal stem cells as adjuvant therapy for limb lengthening in achondroplasia.	Staged leg lengthening allows achondroplastic dwarfs to reach nearly normal height, but it takes long periods of external fixation and it can be burdened by delayed unions. Between 2009 and 2013, eight achondroplastic dwarfs showed delayed unions in the callus formation during femoral lengthening stages in our institute. We performed in-situ injections of bone marrow-derived stem cell concentrates. Patients underwent monthly clinical and radiographic assessment for determination of the healing rate. All eight patients showed an improvement in the regenerated bone, with an average healing index of 23.1 days/cm (range: 18.7-23.8 days/cm). The complete recovery of the delayed consolidation took on an average of 5.2 months (range: 2-10 months). The use of cellular therapy in these patients could represent an innovative application.
23246008	Fracture following lower limb lengthening in children: a series of 58 patients.	INTRODUCTION: Fracture is one of the main complications following external fixator removal used in cases of progressive lower limb lengthening; rates as high as 50% are found in the literature. The aim of this study was to determine the factors influencing this complication. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and eleven cases of lower limb lengthening were performed in 58 patients (40 femurs and 71 tibias). The mean age at surgery was 10.1years old. Lengthening was performed in all cases with an external fixator alone, associated in 39.6% of cases with intramedullary nailing. The patients were divided into three groups according to disease etiology (congenital, achondroplasia and other). The fractures were classified according to the Simpson classification. RESULTS: Twenty fractures were recorded (18%). Sixteen fractures were found in patients with congenital disease, four with achondroplasia and none in the group of other etiologies. The fracture was more often in the femur (27.5%) than in the tibia (12.7%). DISCUSSION: The rate of fracture is influenced by different factors depending on the etiology of disease. In congenital diseases, the fracture rate is higher when there is lengthening of more than 15% of the initial length and a delay between surgery and the beginning of lengthening of less than 7days. In patients with achondroplasia, the influence of a relative percentage of lengthening is less important than in those with congenital disease. However, to avoid fractures, lengthening should not be started in children under the age of nine. Moreover, lengthening should begin at least 7days after the fixator has been placed. TYPE OF STUDY: Retrospective. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV.
27147792	Favorable Growth Hormone Treatment Response in a Young Boy with Achondroplasia.	BACKGROUND: Achondroplasia is a skeletal dysplasia, the most common cause of rhizomelic dwarfism. CASE PRESENTATION: This is a ten year old boy who was first diagnosed prenatally. He had a mutation c1138G>A in the gene FGFR3 in a heterozygotic constellation. His IGF1 and IGFBP3 levels were normal. Two stimulation tests for growth hormone were performed with values within the reference range. His psychomotor development was adequate for his age except for speech difficulty. He started with recombinant hGH (r-hGH) at the age of 3.4 years in a dose of 0.06 mg/kg. His mean Height SDS (HtSDS) was -2.2. RESULTS: The growth increased to 10 cm/year in the first year of therapy (HtSDS -1.1). It decreased during the second year to 4 cm (HtSDS -1.7) and again increased during the third year to 8 cm/year (HtSDS-1.3). In the next years the growth was constant (6.5, 2.3, 3.5 cm / year). He is still growing in the 3(rd) percentile of the growth curve (HtSDS - 1.2) under GH treatment. The body disproportion remained the same. CONCLUSION: The growth response on GH treatment was satisfactory in the first 4 years of treatment, and the boy still continued to grow. The young age at the start of treatment was also of importance. Our other patients with achondroplasia who started treatment older had a poor response to growth hormone.
35635539	Role of proximal tibiofibular fixation in leg lengthening with the Ilizarov method in the achondroplastic patient.	The role of proximal tibiofibular joint (TFJ) transfixion during Ilizarov tibial lengthening is still debated in the literature. The aim of this study was to show that TFJ transfixion can be avoided with no impact on patient outcome. All achondroplastic patients undergoing tibia lengthening from 1999 to 2018 were included. Patients were divided in two groups: group A (11 patients) submitted to proximal TFJ transfixion and group B (22 patients) not submitted to TFJ transfixion. The results showed a statistically significant difference in proximal fibular migration (PFM) between the two groups of patients, with a mean PFM of 9.2 mm (range, 1-20 mm) and of 21 mm (range, 2.7-76 mm) in group A and in group B, respectively. We can state that PFM up to 41 mm in our series did not affect joint function and stability. There are no statistically significant differences in the other radiological parameters. Analysis of functional scores (Knee Society, Tegner-Lhysolm, Association for the Study and Application of Methods of Ilizarov) did not reveal significant differences between the groups. The scores of the Achondroplasia Personal Life Experience Scale were also similar in the two groups, demonstrating a good quality of life. There are no differences between the two groups in terms of clinical-functional outcome of the knee, radiographic results, and quality of life. Transfixion of proximal TFJ may not be necessary, but it is important to avoid premature consolidation of the fibular osteotomy.
32457214	Health Supervision for People With Achondroplasia.	Achondroplasia is the most common short-stature skeletal dysplasia, additionally marked by rhizomelia, macrocephaly, midface hypoplasia, and normal cognition. Potential medical complications associated with achondroplasia include lower extremity long bone bowing, middle-ear dysfunction, obstructive sleep apnea, and, more rarely, cervicomedullary compression, hydrocephalus, thoracolumbar kyphosis, and central sleep apnea. This is the second revision to the original 1995 health supervision guidance from the American Academy of Pediatrics for caring for patients with achondroplasia. Although many of the previously published recommendations remain appropriate for contemporary medical care, this document highlights interval advancements in the clinical methods available to monitor for complications associated with achondroplasia. This document is intended to provide guidance for health care providers to help identify individual patients at high risk of developing serious sequelae and to enable intervention before complications develop.
24563967	Humeral lengthening by distraction osteogenesis: a safe procedure?	This study was conducted to assess the safety of humeral lengthening using an Ilizarov frame. We retrospectively reviewed 26 humeral segments in 17 patients that were lengthened at our department between 1993 and 2011. There were varying aetiologies including achondroplasia, epiphyseal dysplasia, Oilier disease, trauma or infection of the proximal humeral growth-plate, unicameral bone cyst and brachial plexus injury. Mean age at start of surgery was 17.05 years (range : 5-40). The mean lengthening achieved was 8.85 (3-13) cm. Mean lengthening percentage was 353% (range : 10-48). Average healing index was 30.56 days/cm (range : 17.46-4232). There was a significant difference in healing index between achondroplasia patients (28.79 days/cm) compared to others (33.41 days/cm). Minor problems included pin tract infection (14 segments). More important obstacles were temporary elbow flexion contracture (7 segments), premature consolidation (6 segments), radial nerve dysaesthesia (6 segments) and loosening of a Schanz screw (1 segment). Complications included one fracture and one progressive bowing after frame removal. One planned lengthening was not completely achieved. Despite a lot of obstacles, humeral lengthening using an Ilizarov frame provided a reliable method to treat the functional or cosmetic problems of upper limb shortening.
24292534	[Clinical condition and therapy of bone diseases].	Skeletal dysplasia is the term which represents disorders including growth and differentiation of bone, cartilage and ligament. A lot of diseases are included, and new disorders have been added. However, the therapy of most bone diseases is less well-established. Achondroplasia, hypochondroplasia, and osteogenesis imperfecta are most frequent bone diseases. There is no curative treatment for these diseases, however, supportive therapies are available ; for example, growth-hormone therapy for achondroplasia and hypochondroplasia, and bisphosphonate therapy for osteogenesis imperfecta. In addition, enzyme replacement therapy for hypophosphatasia is now on clinical trial. 
36039778	National burden of achondroplasia: an analysis of the National Inpatient and Nationwide Ambulatory Surgery Samples.	Background: To estimate the cost of US hospital admissions and outpatient surgeries associated with achondroplasia. Materials & methods: Using 2017 data from nationally representative databases, this study identifies hospital admissions and outpatient encounters with an achondroplasia diagnosis. Descriptive measures are reported. Results: There were 1985 achondroplasia admissions nationwide. The most frequent admissions were neonatal care (33.7%) in children and musculoskeletal (22.7%) in adults. Average hospital length of stay was 6.8 days, 2.2 days longer than the US mean. Total mean inpatient costs were US$19,959, $7789 greater than the US mean. In the outpatient setting, children 5-14 years accounted for 56.9% of procedures. Conclusion: Achondroplasia is a serious condition with a wide range of lifelong complications frequently requiring hospitalization and surgical intervention.
21088624	Achondroplasia in female twins: surgical indications.	Although in literature achondroplasia has been described profusely, reports on achondroplastic twins are limited. We present two cases of monozygotic female twins with achondroplasia, who underwent limb-lengthening surgical procedure with external fixation in the following five steps: tibia, femur, tibia; femur, homer. Both the cases presented a good limb length and an optimal correction of associated deformities after the treatment, fulfilling the indications. Surgical indications were mostly led by the axial deviations of the lower limbs, and the timing of the limb-lengthening procedures has been the same in both couples showing the importance of this aspect.
23735369	A rare case of percutaneous coronary intervention in achondroplasia.	Achondroplastic individuals are associated with increased cardiac risk when compared to the general population. Coronary interventions in patients with achondroplasia have not been studied previously. We report the case of a 32-year-old male smoker with achondroplasia who presented with acute chest pain of 3 hours duration. He was diagnosed with acute inferior and right ventricular myocardial infarction and thrombolyzed with streptokinase. Since the patient continued to have pain and hypotension, he was taken for rescue percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Because of short stature and kyphoscoliosis, difficulties were faced in cannulating the coronaries and performing intervention. He had total occlusion of proximal right coronary artery, for which angioplasty with stenting was done. To our knowledge, this is the first case of PCI conducted in an achondroplastic patient.
30536224	Surgical technique and outcomes for bilateral humeral lengthening for achondroplasia: 26-year experience.	BACKGROUND: Elongation in patients with achondroplasia provides better overall skeletal proportionality and significantly improves such individuals' access to their perineal region to self-manage personal hygiene. This paper describes our surgical technique and outcomes for bilateral humeral lengthening in achondroplasia patients over 26 years. METHODS: Ours was a retrospective study of 55 patients with achondroplasia-related short stature, in whom bilateral humeral lengthening was performed from 1990 to 2016. We describe the surgical technique and analyze mean gain in humeral length, days using an external fixator, mean percentage of lengthening, external fixation index, type of callus, and complications. Pre- and postoperative radiographic measurements were obtained. Patients also were contacted by telephone and asked about their ability to perform peri-anal self-hygiene and about their overall satisfaction. RESULTS: In total, 110 humeri were lengthened (28 males and 27 females) with medium elongation of 9.5 cm on the right and 9.6 cm on the left, while averaging 220 days in an external fixator. We observed 14 minor complications. There was no significant association between pin position and type of callus, and elongation most often external and in the presence of a straight callus. Before elongation, 77.1% of patients reported difficulties with perineal hygiene and 85.4% could not put their hands in their pockets. Upon completion of lengthening, 100% could perform both tasks and 94.5% were very satisfied. CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral humeral elongation yields significant improvements in patient autonomy, with a relatively low complication rate and very high patient satisfaction.
21304338	The Utrecht approach to exercise in chronic childhood conditions: the decade in review.	PURPOSE: To summarize and discuss current evidence and understanding of clinical pediatric exercise physiology focusing on the work the research group at Utrecht and others have performed in the last decade in a variety of chronic childhood conditions as a continuation of the legacy of Dr Bar-Or. KEY POINTS: The report discusses current research findings on the cardiopulmonary exercise performance of children (and adolescents) with juvenile idiopathic arthritis, osteogenesis imperfecta, achondroplasia, hemophilia, cerebral palsy, spina bifida, cystic fibrosis, and childhood cancer. Exercise recommendations and contraindications are provided for each condition. Implications for clinical practice and future research in this area are discussed for each of the chronic conditions presented. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The authors provide a basic framework for developing an individual and/or disease-specific training program, introduce the physical activity pyramid, and recommend a core set of clinical measures to be used in clinical research.
26443596	Advances in treatment of achondroplasia and osteoarthritis.	Achondroplasia (ACH) is the prototype and most common of the human chondrodysplasias. It results from gain-of-function mutations that exaggerate the signal output of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3), a receptor tyrosine kinase that negatively regulates growth plate activity and linear bone growth. Several approaches to reduce FGFR3 signaling by blocking receptor activation or inhibiting downstream signals have been proposed. Five show promise in preclinical mouse studies. Two candidate therapies target the extracellular domain of FGFR3. The first is a decoy receptor that competes for activating ligands. The second is a synthetic blocking peptide that prevents ligands from binding and activating FGFR3. Two established drugs, statins and meclozine, improve growth of ACH mice. The strongest candidate therapy employs an analog of C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), which antagonizes the mitogen-activated-protein (MAP) kinase pathway downstream of the FGFR3 receptor and may also act independently in the growth plate. Only the CNP analog has reached clinical trials. Preliminary results of Phase 2 studies show a substantial increase in growth rate of ACH children after six months of therapy with no serious adverse effects. A challenge for drug therapy in ACH is targeting agents to the avascular growth plate. The application of gene therapy in osteoarthritis offers insights because it faces similar technical obstacles. Major advances in gene therapy include the emergence of recombinant adeno-associated virus as the vector of choice, capsid engineering to target vectors to specific tissues, and development of methods to direct vectors to articular chondrocytes. 
33382213	Physical fitness and activity level in Norwegian adults with achondroplasia.	This cross-sectional Physical Fitness Study compared cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2 peak), six-minute walk test (6MWT), muscle strength (30sSTS), balance (BESS), and self-reported physical activity level (IPAQ) in Norwegian adults with achondroplasia (ACH) to reference values of average-statured individuals. The feasibility of the physical fitness tests and IPAQ was explored. Forty-three adults (22 women) participated. Mean age was 38 years (range 16-69 years). Mean differences (95% CI) for men and women with ACH compared to reference values were: VO2 peak. -7.0 m/min/kg (-13.6 to -0.5, p = .037), and - 7.9 ml/kg/min (-11.6 to -4.3, p < .001); 6MWT -270.8 m (-340.4 to -201.2, p < .001), and - 196.7 m (-244.3 to -149.0, p = .001); 30sSTS -4.6 repetitions (-7.8 to -1.5, p = .006), and - 1.1 repetitions (-3.4 to 1.1, p = .335). There were no differences within ACH participants, except for VO2 peak, where men performed better. Sufficient physical activity (> 600 metabolic equivalent of task weekly) was achieved by 79% of the participants. The feasibility of the 6MWT and 30sSTS was good. There was a strong correlation between the VO2 peak and 6MWT (men: r = 0.63, p = .007; women: r = 0.71, p < .001). The findings indicate that the 6MWT and 30sSTS test are useful in assessing functional exercise capacity and muscle strength in adults with ACH.
21785895	Is bilateral lower limb lengthening appropriate for achondroplasia?: midterm analysis of the complications and quality of life.	BACKGROUND: Use of the Ilizarov technique for limb lengthening in patients with achondroplasia is controversial, with a high risk of complications balancing cosmetic gains. Although several articles have described the complications of this procedure and satisfaction of patients after surgery, it remains unclear whether lengthening improves the quality of life (QOL) of these patients. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked whether bilateral lower limb lengthenings with deformity correction in patients with achondroplasia would improve QOL and investigated the correlation between complication rate and QOL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 22 patients (average age, 12.7 years) diagnosed with achondroplasia who underwent bilateral lower limb lengthenings between 2002 and 2005. These patients were compared with 22 patients with achondroplasia for whom limb lengthening was not performed. The two groups were assessed using the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) lower limb, SF-36, and Rosenberg self-esteem scores. Minimum followup was 4.5 years (range, 4.5-6.9 years). RESULTS: Among the lengthening group, the average gain in length was 10.21 +- 2.39 cm for the femur and 9.13 +- 2.12 cm for the tibia. A total of 123 complications occurred in these 88 segments. The surgical group had higher Rosenberg self-esteem scores than the nonsurgical group although there were no differences in the AAOS and the SF-36 scores. The self-esteem scores decreased with the increase in the number of complications. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that despite frequent complications, bilateral lower limb lengthening increases patients' QOL. We believe lengthening is a reasonable option in selected patients. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, therapeutic study. See the Guidelines for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.

37882884	Vosoritide Therapy in Children with Achondroplasia: Early Experience and Practical Considerations for Clinical Practice.	INTRODUCTION: Vosoritide is the first precision medical therapy approved to increase growth velocity in children with achondroplasia. Sharing early prescribing experiences across different regions could provide a framework for developing practical guidance for the real-world use of vosoritide. METHODS: Two meetings were held to gather insight and early experience from experts in Europe, the Middle East, and the USA. The group comprised geneticists, pediatric endocrinologists, pediatricians, and orthopedic surgeons. Current practices and considerations for vosoritide were discussed, including administration practicalities, assessments, and how to manage expectations. RESULTS: A crucial step in the management of achondroplasia is to determine if adequate multidisciplinary support is in place. Training for families is essential, including practical information on administration of vosoritide, and how to recognize and manage injection-site reactions. Advocated techniques include establishing a routine, empowering patients by allowing them to choose injection sites, and managing pain. Patients may discontinue vosoritide if they cannot tolerate daily injections or are invited to participate in a clinical trial. Clinicians in Europe and the Middle East emphasized the importance of assessing adherence to daily injections, as non-adherence may impact response and reimbursement. Protocols for monitoring patients receiving vosoritide may be influenced by regional differences in reimbursement and healthcare systems. Core assessments may include pubertal staging, anthropometry, radiography to confirm open physes, the review of adverse events, and discussion of concomitant or new medications-but timing of these assessments may also differ regionally and vary across institutions. Patients and families should be informed that response to vosoritide can vary in both magnitude and timing. Keeping families informed regarding vosoritide clinical trial data is encouraged. CONCLUSION: The early real-world experience with vosoritide is generally positive. Sharing these insights is important to increase understanding of the practicalities of treatment with vosoritide in the clinical setting.
27823711	Central sleep apnea in children: experience at a single center.	OBJECTIVE: Central sleep apnea (CSA) syndromes are rare in children and data in children over one year of age are scarce. The aim of the study was to describe the sleep characteristics, underlying disorders, management, and outcome of children with CSA. PATIENTS/METHODS: A retrospective chart review of all children >1 year of age, diagnosed with CSA on a laboratory sleep study during a 20-month period, was performed. CSA was defined by a central apnea index (CAI) >5 events/h. The clinical management and the patient's outcome were analyzed. RESULTS: Eighteen of 441 (4.1%) patients recorded during the study period had CSA. The median CAI, pulse oximetry, and oxygen desaturation index were 13/h (range 6-146), 96% (93-98%), and 18/h (6-98), respectively. Neurosurgical pathologies represented the most common underlying disorders with Arnold-Chiari malformation in four and ganglioglioma in three patients. Other underlying disorders were Prader-Willi syndrome (N = 3), achondroplasia (N = 2), and Down syndrome, with one patient having an achondroplasia and a Down syndrome. The remaining six patients had other genetic diseases. The most common investigation was brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Individualized management with neurosurgery and/or chemotherapy, continuous positive airway pressure (in two patients having associated obstructive events), or noninvasive ventilation resulted in an improvement in CSA and the clinical presentation in 11 patients. CONCLUSION: CSA is rare in children >1 year of age. Underlying disorders are dominated by neurosurgical disorders. Individualized management is able to improve CSA and the clinical condition in most patients.
22768967	Neurogenic claudication associated with posterior vertebral rim fractures in children.	OBJECT: Outside of the patient population with achondroplasia, neurogenic claudication is rare in the pediatric age group. Neurogenic claudication associated with posterior vertebral rim fracture is even more uncommon but nonetheless causes pain and disability in affected children and adolescents. The purpose of this study was to describe the surgical results of 3 adolescents presenting with neurogenic claudication and posterior vertebral rim fracture when treated with laminectomy alone. METHODS: The medical and operative records of the 3 pediatric patients were retrospectively reviewed. Presenting signs and symptoms and CT findings, such as the interpedicular distances between T-12 and L-5, were obtained. Perioperative results were assessed, including operative time, blood loss, length of hospital stay, and complications. Findings at latest follow-up were also recorded, including a patient satisfaction survey. RESULTS: The 3 patients (1 girl and 2 boys) had a mean age of 14.7 years (range 14-15 years) and underwent follow-up for a mean of 11.3 months (range 5-18 months). Notable preoperative signs and symptoms included back pain (all patients), leg pain (all patients), leg numbness (1 patient), and leg weakness (1 patient). No patient presented with bowel and/or bladder dysfunction. The mean blood loss during laminectomy was 123 ml (range 20-300 ml), and the mean length of hospital stay was 4.3 days (range 3-6 days). On average, decompression was performed at 2.2 levels (range 2-2.5 levels). All 3 patients reported at most recent follow-up that they were "satisfied" with the surgery. There was 1 complication of instability from an iatrogenic pars fracture, which required reoperation and posterior instrumented fusion. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this report represents the first surgical series of pediatric neurogenic claudication associated with posterior vertebral rim fractures. Pediatric neurosurgeons may infrequently encounter neurogenic claudication associated with a posterior vertebral rim fracture in children. To treat children with neurogenic claudication associated with posterior vertebral rim fractures, a simple laminectomy may be a safe and efficacious alternative to discectomy and removal of fracture fragments.
36796809	[Preliminary study of Ilizarov technique in treatment of lower limb deformity caused by achondroplasia].	Objective: To investigate the surgical method and preliminary effectiveness of Ilizarov technique in the treatment of lower limb deformity caused by achondroplasia. Methods: The clinical data of 38 patients with lower limb deformity caused by achondroplasia treated by Ilizarov technique between February 2014 and September 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. There were 18 males and 20 females, the age ranged from 7 to 34 years, with an average of 14.8 years. All patients presented with bilateral knee varus deformity. The preoperative varus angles was (15.2+-4.2) , and knee society score (KSS) was 61.8+-7.2. Nine of these patients underwent tibia and fibula osteotomy, 29 cases underwent tibia and fibula osteotomy and bone lengthening at the same time. Full-length bearing position X-ray films of bilateral lower limbs were taken to measure the bilateral varus angles, analyze the healing index, and record the occurrence of complications. KSS score was used to evaluate the improvement of knee joint function before and after operation. Results: All 38 cases were followed up 9-65 months, with an average of 26.3 months. Needle tract infection occurred in 4 cases and needle tract loosening occurred in 2 cases after operation, which were improved after symptomatic treatment such as dressing change, Kirschner wire change, and oral antibiotics, and no neurovascular injury occurred in all patients. The external fixator was worn for 3-11 months after operation, with an average of 7.6 months, and the healing index was 43-59 d/cm, with an average of 50.3 d/cm. At last follow-up, the leg was 3-10 cm longer, with an average of 5.5 cm. The varus angles was (1.5+-0.2)  and the KSS score was 93.7+-2.6, which significantly improved when compared with those before operation ( P<0.05). Conclusion: Ilizarov technique is a safe and effective method for the treatment of short limb with genu varus deformity caused by achondroplasia, which can improve the quality of life of patients.
28224446	Current Care and Investigational Therapies in Achondroplasia.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The goal of this review is to evaluate the management options for achondroplasia, the most common non-lethal skeletal dysplasia. This disease is characterized by short stature and a variety of complications, some of which can be quite severe. RECENT FINDINGS: Despite several attempts to standardize care, there is still no widely accepted consensus. This is in part due to absence of concrete data on the incidence of sudden unexplained death in infants with achondroplasia and the best investigation for ascertaining which individuals could benefit from foramen magnum decompression surgery. In this review, we identify the different options of care and management for the various orthopedic, neurologic, and respiratory complications. In parallel, several innovative or drug repositioning therapies are being investigated that would restore bone growth but may also prevent complications.

39258897	Discovery of TYRA-300: First Oral Selective FGFR3 Inhibitor for the Treatment of Urothelial Cancers and Achondroplasia.	Activating FGFR3 alterations have been identified in up to 15-20% of muscle-invasive bladder cancer and metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC), and as high as 80% in nonmuscle invasive bladder cancers. FGFR3 germline mutations have also been associated with a variety of skeletal dysplasias. Achondroplasia, the most common form of dwarfism in humans, results from a G380R mutation in FGFR3. The pan-FGFR inhibitor erdafitinib was approved for the treatment of mUC with FGFR3 alterations but is limited due to FGFR isoform off-target toxicities and the development of on-target gatekeeper resistance mutations. TYRA-300 (22) was conceived using a structure-based approach as a potent FGFR3-selective inhibitor to avoid the toxicities associated with inhibition of FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR4, and to be agnostic for the FGFR3 gatekeeper mutations. TYRA-300 is being evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical trial in urothelial cancers and solid tumors, with intention to initiate Phase 2 studies in urothelial cancers and achondroplasia.
29652901	Early postnatal soluble FGFR3 therapy prevents the atypical development of obesity in achondroplasia.	BACKGROUND: Achondroplasia is a rare genetic disease is characterized by abnormal bone development and early obesity. While the bone aspect of the disease has been thoroughly studied, early obesity affecting approximately 50% of them during childhood has been somewhat neglected. It nevertheless represents a major health problem in these patients, and is associated to life-threatening complications including increasing risk of cardiovascular pathologies. We have thus decided to study obesity in patients and to use the mouse model to evaluate if soluble FGFR3 therapy, an innovative treatment approach for achondroplasia, could also impact the development of this significant complication. METHODS AND FINDINGS: To achieve this, we have first fully characterized the metabolic deregulations in these patients by conducting a longitudinal retrospective study, in children with achondroplasia Anthropometric, densitometric measures as well as several blood parameters were recorded and compared between three age groups ranging from [0-3], [4-8] and [9-18] years old. Our results show unexpected results with the development of an atypical obesity with preferential fat deposition in the abdomen that is remarkably not associated with classical complications of obesity such as diabetes or hypercholosterolemia. Because it is not associated with diabetes, the atypical obesity has not been studied in the past even though it is recognized as a real problem in these patients. These results were validated in a murine model of achondroplasia (Fgfr3ach/+) where similar visceral adiposity was observed. Unexpected alterations in glucose metabolism were highlighted during high-fat diet. Glucose, insulin or lipid levels remained low, without the development of diabetes. Very interestingly, in achondroplasia mice treated with soluble FGFR3 during the growth period (from D3 to D22), the development of these metabolic deregulations was prevented in adult animals (between 4 and 14 weeks of age). The lean-over-fat tissues ratio was restored and glucose metabolism showed normal levels. Treating Fgfr3ach/+ mice with soluble FGFR3 during the growth period, prevented the development of these metabolic deregulations in adult animals and restored lean-over-fat tissues ratio as well as glucose metabolism in adult animals. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrate that achondroplasia patients develop an atypical obesity with preferential abdominal obesity not associated with classical complications. These results suggest that achondroplasia induces an uncommon metabolism of energy, directly linked to the FGFR3 mutation. These data strongly suggest that this common complication of achondroplasia should be included in the clinical management of patients. In this context, sFGFR3 proved to be a promising treatment for achondroplasia by normalizing the biology at different levels, not only restoring bone growth but also preventing the atypical visceral obesity and some metabolic deregulations.
38748332	European Achondroplasia Forum Practical Considerations for Following Adults with Achondroplasia.	Achondroplasia is a lifelong condition requiring lifelong management. There is consensus that infants and children with achondroplasia should be managed by a multidisciplinary team experienced in the condition. However, many people are lost to follow-up after the transition from paediatric to adult care, and there is no standardised approach for management in adults, despite the recent availability of international consensus guidelines. To address this, the European Achondroplasia Forum has developed a patient-held checklist to support adults with achondroplasia in managing their health. The checklist highlights key symptoms of spinal stenosis and obstructive sleep apnoea, both among the most frequent and potentially severe medical complications in adults with achondroplasia. The checklist acts as a framework to support individuals and their primary care provider in completing a routine review. General advice on issues such as blood pressure, pain, hearing, weight, adaptive aids, and psychosocial aspects are also included. The checklist provides key symptoms to be aware of, in addition to action points so that people can approach their primary care provider and be directed to the appropriate specialist, if needed. Additionally, the European Achondroplasia Forum offers some ideas on implementing the checklist during the transition from paediatric to adult care, thus ensuring the existing multidisciplinary team model in place during childhood can support in engaging individuals and empowering them to take responsibility for their own care as they move into adulthood.

31789832	Update on methods to enhance growth.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To discuss treatments used to enhance growth in pediatric patients with short stature. RECENT FINDINGS: New data confirm the known efficacy of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) in growth hormone deficiency (GHD) and idiopathic short stature. The latest data from the Safety and Appropriateness of Growth hormone Treatment in Europe cohort did not indicate a long-term risk of malignancy in those treated for isolated GHD, but possibly increased risk in those with other diagnoses. Recombinant human insulin-like growth factor 1 is effective in treating patients with pregnancy-associated plasma protein A2 deficiency. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists or aromatase inhibitor treatment to delay puberty remains controversial. They are more likely to augment adult height if combined with rhGH treatment in children already receiving rhGH. Preliminary data indicate that recombinant C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) is safe in children and increases growth velocity upon 42 months of treatment in achondroplasia. SUMMARY: Recent data confirms previous data on rhGH efficacy and safety. Therapies to delay growth plate closure have greatest efficacy to augment height if combined with GH in select diagnoses. Recombinant CNP holds promise as a medical treatment for short stature associated with achondroplasia.
24840655	Spinal decompression in achondroplastic patients using high-speed drill versus ultrasonic bone curette: technical note and outcomes in 30 cases.	BACKGROUND: This manuscript describes the clinical and operative characteristics of achondroplastic children who undergo multilevel thoracolumbar decompressions using either the high-speed drill or the ultrasonic bone curette (BoneScalpel). METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 30 thoracolumbar decompressions in achondroplastic patients at a single institution between 2008 and 2013. Patients were classified into either the high-speed drill cohort or the BoneScalpel cohort, depending on which instrument was utilized to perform the decompression. A technical note on the role of the ultrasonic bone curette in decompressing stenotic achondroplastic spines is also provided. RESULTS: In comparison with the high-speed drill cohort, the BoneScalpel cohort experienced less overall perioperative complications, including durotomy, cerebrospinal fluid leak, pseudomeningoceles, wound infection, and wound dehiscence. Although 45.0% of patients experienced a durotomy in the high-speed drill cohort, only 30.0% of patients experienced a durotomy in the BoneScalpel cohort (P = 0.694). In the high-speed drill cohort, the number of patients complaining of sensory disturbances, back pain, ataxia, incontinence, neurogenic claudication, radiculopathy, ataxia, and/or weakness decreased postoperatively. Similar results were observed in the BoneScalpel cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Although spinal decompression provides symptomatic resolution in patients with achondroplasia, intraoperative complications, in general, and durotomies, in particular, are common. Here, we report a decreased incidence in intraoperative durotomy and overall perioperative complication rates in the BoneScalpel cohort, although this did not reach the level of statistical significance. Nonetheless, the data demonstrate that the BoneScalpel is a safe and efficacious alternative to the high-speed drill in these challenging patients. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II-retrospective study.
30554178	Screening and surgery for foramen magnum stenosis in children with achondroplasia: a large, national database analysis.	OBJECTIVEThe goal of this study was to determine the rates of screening and surgery for foramen magnum stenosis in children with achondroplasia in a large, privately insured healthcare network.METHODSRates of screening and surgery for foramen magnum stenosis in children with achondroplasia were determined using de-identified insurance claims data from a large, privately insured healthcare network of over 58 million beneficiaries across the United States between 2001 and 2014. Cases of achondroplasia and screening and surgery claims were identified using a combination of International Classification of Diseases diagnosis codes and Current Procedural Terminology codes. American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) practice guidelines were used to determine screening trends.RESULTSThe search yielded 3577 children age 19 years or younger with achondroplasia. Of them, 236 met criteria for inclusion in the screening analysis. Among the screening cohort, 41.9% received some form of screening for foramen magnum stenosis, whereas 13.9% of patients were fully and appropriately screened according to the 2005 guidelines from the AAP. The screening rate significantly increased after the issuance of the AAP guidelines. Among all children in the cohort, 25 underwent cervicomedullary decompression for foramen magnum stenosis. The incidence rate of undergoing cervicomedullary decompression was highest in infancy (28 per 1000 patient-years) and decreased with age (5 per 1000 patient-years for all other ages combined).CONCLUSIONSChildren with achondroplasia continue to be underscreened for foramen magnum stenosis, although screening rates have improved since the release of the 2005 AAP surveillance guidelines. The incidence of surgery was highest in infants and decreased with age.
37280669	Achondroplasia natural history study (CLARITY): 60-year experience in orthopedic surgery from four skeletal dysplasia centers.	BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to describe the frequency and risk factors for orthopedic surgery in patients with achondroplasia. CLARITY (The Achondroplasia Natural History Study) includes clinical data from achondroplasia patients receiving treatment at four skeletal dysplasia centers in the United States from 1957 to 2018. Data were entered and stored in a Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) database. RESULTS: Information from one thousand three hundred and seventy-four patients with achondroplasia were included in this study. Four hundred and eight (29.7%) patients had at least one orthopedic surgery during their lifetime and 299 (21.8%) patients underwent multiple procedures. 12.7% (n = 175) of patients underwent spine surgery at a mean age at first surgery of 22.4 +- 15.3 years old. The median age was 16.7 years old (0.1-67.4). 21.2% (n = 291) of patients underwent lower extremity surgery at a mean age at first surgery of 9.9 +- 8.3 years old with a median age of 8.2 years (0.2-57.8). The most common spinal procedure was decompression (152 patients underwent 271 laminectomy procedures), while the most common lower extremity procedure was osteotomy (200 patients underwent 434 procedures). Fifty-eight (4.2%) patients had both a spine and lower extremity surgery. Specific risk factors increasing the likelihood of orthopedic surgery included: patients with hydrocephalus requiring shunt placement having higher odds of undergoing spine surgery (OR 1.97, 95% CI 1.14-3.26); patients having a cervicomedullary decompression also had higher odds of undergoing spine surgery (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.30-2.63); and having lower extremity surgery increased the odds of spine surgery (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.45-2.90). CONCLUSIONS: Orthopedic surgery was a common occurrence in achondroplasia with 29.7% of patients undergoing at least one orthopedic procedure. Spine surgery (12.7%) was less common and occurred at a later age than lower extremity surgery (21.2%). Cervicomedullary decompression and hydrocephalus with shunt placement were associated with an increased risk for spine surgery. The results from CLARITY, the largest natural history study of achondroplasia, should aid clinicians in counseling patients and families about orthopedic surgery.
24140778	Intraoperative computed tomography for cervicomedullary decompression of foramen magnum stenosis in achondroplasia: two case reports.	The authors report two cases of cervicomedullary decompression of foramen magnum (FM) stenosis in children with achondroplasia using intraoperative computed tomography (iCT). A 14-month-old girl with myelopathy and retarded motor development, and a 10-year-old girl who had already undergone incomplete FM decompression was presented with myelopathy. Both patients underwent decompressive sub-occipitalcraniectomy and C1 laminectomy without duraplasty using iCT. It clearly showed the extent of FM decompression during surgery, which finally enabled sufficient decompression. After the operation, their myelopathy improved. We think that iCT can provide useful information and guidance for sufficient decompression for FM stenosis in children with achondroplasia. 
31345829	Thoracic spine Langerhans cell histiocytosis in a child with achondroplasia.	Multifocal bone Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is usually treated with prednisolone and vinblastine. We present a case conservatively treated with indomethacin with good clinical and radiological response. A 7-year-old achondroplastic boy presented with worsening thoracic back pain and leg weakness. An admission MRI spine showed a pathological T1 vertebrae fracture with posterior soft tissue extension compressing and distorting the spinal cord. A CT guided biopsy revealed an LCH. Steroids were avoided to reduce osteopenia risk and further vertebral fragility. Considering the risk of a thoracic surgical approach in a child with this background, he was managed conservatively with indomethacin and a Sternal Occipital Mandibular Immobilizer (SOMI) Brace. Pain resolved completely within 6 months and the brace was discontinued. Serial follow-up scans showed progressive resolution of the pathological T1 fracture and complete resolution of the spinal cord compression.
32891212	Once-daily, subcutaneous vosoritide therapy in children with achondroplasia: a randomised, double-blind, phase 3, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial.	BACKGROUND: There are no effective therapies for achondroplasia. An open-label study suggested that vosoritide administration might increase growth velocity in children with achondroplasia. This phase 3 trial was designed to further assess these preliminary findings. METHODS: This randomised, double-blind, phase 3, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial compared once-daily subcutaneous administration of vosoritide with placebo in children with achondroplasia. The trial was done in hospitals at 24 sites in seven countries (Australia, Germany, Japan, Spain, Turkey, the USA, and the UK). Eligible patients had a clinical diagnosis of achondroplasia, were ambulatory, had participated for 6 months in a baseline growth study and were aged 5 to less than 18 years at enrolment. Randomisation was done by means of a voice or web-response system, stratified according to sex and Tanner stage. Participants, investigators, and trial sponsor were masked to group assignment. Participants received either vosoritide 15 0 mug/kg or placebo, as allocated, for the duration of the 52-week treatment period administered by daily subcutaneous injections in their homes by trained caregivers. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in mean annualised growth velocity at 52 weeks in treated patients as compared with controls. All randomly assigned patients were included in the efficacy analyses (n=121). All patients who received one dose of vosoritide or placebo (n=121) were included in the safety analyses. The trial is complete and is registered, with EudraCT, number, 2015-003836-11. FINDINGS: All participants were recruited from Dec 12, 2016, to Nov 7, 2018, with 60 assigned to receive vosoritide and 61 to receive placebo. Of 124 patients screened for eligibility, 121 patients were randomly assigned, and 119 patients completed the 52-week trial. The adjusted mean difference in annualised growth velocity between patients in the vosoritide group and placebo group was 1 57 cm/year in favour of vosoritide (95% CI [1 22-1 93]; two-sided p<0 0001). A total of 119 patients had at least one adverse event; vosoritide group, 59 (98%), and placebo group, 60 (98%). None of the serious adverse events were considered to be treatment related and no deaths occurred. INTERPRETATION: Vosoritide is an effective treatment to increase growth in children with achondroplasia. It is not known whether final adult height will be increased, or what the harms of long-term therapy might be. FUNDING: BioMarin Pharmaceutical.
21526683	Anesthetic management of achondroplastic dwarf undergoing cesarean section--a case report.	There are more than 100 different types of dwarfism. Achondroplasia is the most common of these conditions. The aim of this report is to describe the anesthetic management of these patient, discussing the anesthetic considerations and emphasizing the difficulties encountered. A 32-year-old achondroplastic parturient underwent cesarean section under general anesthesia. We did not encounter problems related with airway management. The operation went without any complication. There are risks for both regional and general anesthesia in achondroplastic patients. The most important point is the careful preoperative assessment. Anesthesia plan should be specified to individual basis.
35138050	Experiences of children and adolescents living with achondroplasia and their caregivers.	BACKGROUND: Achondroplasia, caused by a pathogenic variant in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 gene (FGFR3), leads to significant multisystem complications across the lifespan that may affect the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of individuals and families living with the condition. METHODS: The objective of this qualitative study was to describe the HRQoL of children and adolescents with achondroplasia and their caregivers. Thirty-four caregivers and 12 adolescents from the United States and Spain participated in one of eight focus groups or completed an individual interview, which was audio-recorded and transcribed. Thematic analysis of qualitative data was performed to identify commonly occurring themes pertaining to HRQoL. RESULTS: Caregivers and adolescents described challenges with physical functioning and medical complications due to achondroplasia. Key challenges included difficulties performing activities of daily living, issues of accessibility, bullying, or unwanted attention in public, and negative effects on self-esteem. Caregivers were concerned about accessing appropriate medical care for their child, and also reported experiencing financial, relational, and emotional challenges in their families. Achondroplasia also affected individuals and their families in positive ways, including increasing empathy, receiving positive attention, and feeling supported by the achondroplasia community. CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the importance of regular assessments of HRQoL and the provision of psychosocial support to affected children and families.
25686888	Surgical treatment for cervicomedullary compression among infants with achondroplasia.	PURPOSE: Achondroplasia is the most common form of dwarfism. Respiratory failure is responsible for most deaths among these children and is often related to cervicomedullary compression (CMC). We present our experience with early cervicomedullary decompression in infants with achondroplasia. METHODS: Data was retrospectively collected for infants with achondroplasia who underwent CMC decompression between 1998 and 2013. Data included presurgical and postsurgical neurological examinations, MRI scans, and sleep study results. RESULTS: Ten infants were included. Ages at surgery were 4 to 23 months (12.5 +- 6.88 months). All infants displayed neurological findings prior to surgery, although often subtle. All infants underwent a foramen magnum opening with a wide C1 laminectomy. Following surgery, seven patients (70 %) demonstrated improved neurological status, and one displayed neurological deterioration. Seven patients demonstrated improved sleep quality 1 year after surgery. These patients had a good or improved neurological status following surgery. Preoperative radiological findings included abnormal hyperintense T2 changes in all children (improved following surgery in six children), brainstem distortion in four children (improved in all), and diminished cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) spaces at the level of the foramen magnum in eight children (improved in seven). One child with extensive preoperative T2 changes accompanied by neurological and respiratory decline, deteriorated following surgery, and remains chronically ventilated. CONCLUSIONS: Infants with achondroplasia are prone to neurological and respiratory symptoms. We believe that early diagnosis and early surgery for decompression of the foramen magnum and C1 lamina can alleviate respiratory symptoms, improve neurological status, and perhaps prevent sudden infant death in this population.
35858423	A long-acting C-natriuretic peptide for achondroplasia.	The C-natriuretic peptide (CNP) analog vosoritide has recently been approved for treatment of achondroplasia in children. However, the regimen requires daily subcutaneous injections in pediatric patients over multiple years. The present work sought to develop a long-acting CNP that would provide efficacy equal to or greater than that of vosoritide but require less frequent injections. We used a technology for half-life extension, whereby a drug is attached to tetra-polyethylene glycol hydrogels (tetra-PEG) by beta-eliminative linkers that cleave at predetermined rates. These hydrogels-fabricated as uniform ~60-mum microspheres-are injected subcutaneously, where they serve as a stationary depot to slowly release the drug into the systemic circulation. We prepared a highly active, stable CNP analog-[Gln6,14]CNP-38-composed of the 38 C-terminal amino acids of human CNP-53 containing Asn to Gln substitutions to preclude degradative deamidation. Two microsphere [Gln6,14]CNP-38 conjugates were prepared, with release rates designed to allow once-weekly and once-monthly administration. After subcutaneous injection of the conjugates in mice, [Gln6,14]CNP-38 was slowly released into the systemic circulation and showed biphasic elimination pharmacokinetics with terminal half-lives of ~200 and ~600 h. Both preparations increased growth of mice comparable to or exceeding that produced by daily vosoritide. Simulations of the pharmacokinetics in humans indicated that plasma [Gln6,14]CNP-38 levels should be maintained within a therapeutic window over weekly, biweekly, and likely, monthly dosing intervals. Compared with vosoritide, which requires ~30 injections per month, microsphere [Gln6,14]CNP-38 conjugates-especially the biweekly and monthly dosing-could provide an alternative that would be well accepted by physicians, patients, and patient caregivers.
25827920	Acute upper airway obstruction and emergency front of neck access in an achondroplastic patient.	Dwarfism is defined as a failure to attain a height of 148 cm in adulthood. Achondroplasia is the most common form of short-limbed dwarfism. Although this condition is relatively rare, with an incidence of 0.5-1.5 per 10,000 live births, most medical professionals will come across the achondroplastic dwarf (AD) during their career. Faulty endochondral ossification produces the characteristic short stature phenotype, as well as severe craniofacial, central nervous system, spinal, respiratory and cardiac anomalies. These unusual characteristics may present airway management difficulties in elective as well as emergency situations. Within the literature there is very little information regarding the emergency insertion of a surgical airway in an adult AD. We present our experience of this situation in the form of a case report and a review of the relevant literature.
22559284	FGFR3 targeting strategies for achondroplasia.	Mutations that exaggerate signalling of the receptor tyrosine kinase fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) give rise to achondroplasia, the most common form of dwarfism in humans. Here we review the clinical features, genetic aspects and molecular pathogenesis of achondroplasia and examine several therapeutic strategies designed to target the mutant receptor or its signalling pathways, including the use of kinase inhibitors, blocking antibodies, physiologic antagonists, RNAi and chaperone inhibitors. We conclude by discussing the challenges of treating growth plate disorders in children.
30070059	Outpatient initiation of long-term continuous positive airway pressure in children.	INTRODUCTION: Current guidelines recommend initiating continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in children during an overnight in-hospital titration study. Due to a shortage of hospital beds and economic constraints, we started a program for outpatient initiation of CPAP in selected children with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). METHODS: Objective CPAP compliance and efficacy were evaluated in consecutive children enrolled in an outpatient CPAP program when they fulfilled the following criteria: persistent OSA, age >6 months, stable condition, family living in the Parisian area and agreeing with a regular follow-up. RESULTS: Thirty-one children, median (range) age 8.9 years (0.8-17.5), were included in the program. The most common diagnosis were Down syndrome (n = 7), achondroplasia (n = 3), and obesity (n = 3). Median baseline obstructive apnea-hypopnea index (OAHI) was 12.5 events/h (5-100). Median duration of follow-up was 12.3 months (2.2-25.2). Four subjects (three adolescents with Down syndrome) were not compliant at 2-month follow-up with a compliance <4 h/night. In the other 27 subjects, median compliance was 08:21 h:min/night (05:45-12:20), with a median number of night use per month of 25 (18-30). CPAP efficacy at the end of follow-up was excellent in the compliant subjects with a median AHI of two events/h (0-4) and normal gas exchange with CPAP therapy. Three subjects were successfully weaned from CPAP treatment during the study period. CONCLUSION: Initiating CPAP in an outpatient setting in children is feasible and effective in selected subjects. A high rate of compliance can be achieved as well as a correction of OSA.
28889181	Humeral lengthening in patients with achondroplasia and in patients with post-septic shortening: comparison of procedure efficiency and safety.	PURPOSE: Although humeral lengthening in patients with achondroplasia is an accepted procedure for improving functional status, there is still a paucity of information about the effectiveness of the method. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of humeral lengthening using monolateral fixators in patients with achondroplasia and unilateral shortening. METHODS: Twenty-one patients (31 humeri) were included in this study. The study group consisted of eight patients with achondroplasia (16 segments). The control group consisted of 13 patients with post-septic shortening of the humerus (15 segments). All subjects underwent distraction osteogenesis with the use of a monolateral fixator. RESULTS: The mean lengthening in the patients with achondroplasia was 8.29 cm, whereas in the control group it was 7.34 cm (p = 0.1677). The mean lengthening percentage in the patients with achondroplasia (50% of the initial length of the humerus) was significantly greater than in the control group (33% of the initial length of the humerus) (p = 0.0007). The mean healing index was 24.8 days/cm in the patients with achondroplasia and 28.56 days/cm in the control group (p = 0.1832). The overall complication rates for the achondroplastic and post-septic patients were, respectively, 175% and 160% (p = 0.1420). CONCLUSIONS: Humeral lengthening with use of monolateral fixators in patients with achondroplasia is an efficient method. Although the segment lengthening percentage is significantly greater in patients with achondroplasia than in patients with post-septic shortening of the humerus, the safety of this procedure is comparable.

28808977	Skeletal Dysplasias: What Every Bone Health Clinician Needs to Know.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review highlights how skeletal dysplasias are diagnosed and how our understanding of some of these conditions has now translated to treatment options. RECENT FINDINGS: The use of multigene panels, using next-generation sequence technology, has improved our ability to quickly identify the genetic etiology, which can impact management. There are successes with the use of growth hormone in individuals with SHOX deficiencies, asfotase alfa in hypophosphatasia, and some promising data for c-type natriuretic peptide for those with achondroplasia. One needs to consider that a patient with short stature has a skeletal dysplasia as options for management may be available.
31689252	Syndromic Scoliosis: National Trends in Surgical Management and Inpatient Hospital Outcomes: A 12-Year Analysis.	STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the trends in management and inpatient outcomes in patients with syndromic scoliosis undergoing spinal deformity correction. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Syndromic scoliosis (SS) refers to scoliosis that is most commonly associated with systemic disease including Ehler Danhlos syndrome (EDS), Marfan syndrome (MF), Down syndrome (DS), Achondroplasia (AP), and Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). Limited data exist evaluating hospital outcomes in patients with SS undergoing spinal deformity correction. METHODS: The Kids' Inpatient Database (KIDS) was queried from 2001 to 2012 to identify all pediatric patients with scoliosis undergoing spinal fusion. These patients were then sub-divided into two cohorts: (1) patients with idiopathic scoliosis (IS) and (2) patients with syndromic scoliosis. Trends in surgical management, and postoperative morbidity and mortality were assessed. Length of stay and total hospital charges were additionally analyzed. A sub-analysis to characterize outcomes in each syndrome was also performed. RESULTS: An estimated 1071 patients with SS were identified and compared with 24,989 pediatric patients with IS. MF (36.8%), Down syndrome (16.0%), and PWS (14.9%) were the most common diagnoses among patients with SS. Between 2001 and 2012, there was a significant decline in the number of anterior procedures performed in both cohorts. Conversely, the number of posterior based procedures increased. SS was associated with increased major complications (2.7% compared with 1.0% in IS; P < 0.001) and minor complication rates (41.0% compared with 28.5% in IS; P < 0.001). Patients with AP incurred the highest rate of major complications (10.7%), minor complications (60.8%), and intraoperative durotomies (6.1%). Total hospital charges increased significantly over the 12-year span. CONCLUSION: Trends in management of syndromic scoliosis have paralleled that of idiopathic scoliosis. Syndromic scoliosis is associated with increased risks with surgical deformity correction. Further prospective studies are warranted to evaluate the reasons for these differences. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3.
35481707	Phase 1 safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics results of a long-acting C-type natriuretic peptide prodrug, TransCon CNP.	AIM: TransCon CNP is a novel prodrug designed to provide sustained release of C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) for once-weekly therapy, addressing the pathology leading to aberrant skeletal development in achondroplasia. This phase 1 trial was initiated to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics (PD) and pharmacokinetics (PK) of TransCon CNP. METHODS: This randomized, placebo-controlled, single-ascending dose phase 1 trial was performed at two sites in Australia and enrolled 45 healthy adult males. Subjects received placebo or TransCon CNP (single-ascending dose cohorts [3, 10, 25, 75 or 150 mug CNP/kg]). The primary endpoint was frequency of adverse events and other safety outcomes. Other endpoints included PK and PD measured by cyclic guanosine-monophosphate (cGMP) and amino-terminal propeptide of CNP (NTproCNP). RESULTS: TransCon CNP provided continuous systemic exposure to CNP over at least 7 days post-dose. Plasma and urine levels of cGMP were significantly increased in subjects administered TransCon CNP at 75-150 mug CNP/kg, indicating target engagement of active CNP at the natriuretic peptide receptor-B (NPR-B) for at least 1 week post-dose. TransCon CNP was well-tolerated, with no serious treatment-emergent adverse events or discontinuations. Extensive cardiac safety assessments did not reveal any clinically relevant effects on electrocardiogram parameters, including heart rate, PR, QRS and QTcF intervals. CONCLUSIONS: Safety and PD data from this phase 1 trial support that TransCon CNP is well tolerated, with a PK profile compatible with a once-weekly dosing regimen. Further studies are ongoing to evaluate the potential of TransCon CNP to positively impact abnormal endochondral ossification in children with achondroplasia.
28481811	Trochanteric Entry for Femoral Lengthening Nails in Children: Is It Safe?	BACKGROUND: Antegrade intramedullary (IM) nailing for skeletally immature femur fractures can damage the capital femoral epiphysis blood supply, leading to avascular necrosis (AVN) of the femoral head. Reported AVN rates are 2% for piriformis entry and 1.4% for trochanteric entry. None of previous reports described IM lengthening nails for limb lengthening procedures. We have used self-lengthening telescopic nails with a proximal Herzog bend and standard trochanteric entry for femoral lengthening in children. The purpose of this study is to determine whether trochanteric entry IM lengthening nails can be used safely (no AVN or proximal femoral deformity) in the skeletally immature femur. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed between 2004 and 2014 to determine all skeletally immature patients younger than 18 years of age who had a reamed IM lengthening nail inserted through the greater trochanter, with at least 1-year follow-up. RESULTS: Thirty-one femurs were lengthened in 28 patients (17 males and 11 females). The etiology was congenital femoral deficiency (10), achondroplasia (6), post-traumatic (5), hemihypertrophy (3), Ollier disease (2), and miscellaneous (5). An attending surgeon was present for all procedures. Mean age at time of surgery was 12.9 years (range, 7 to 17 y). Mean follow-up was 3.5 years (range, 1.4 to 9 y). The average amount of lengthening was 5.4 cm (range, 3 to 6.7 cm). Twenty-four nails were 10.7 mm in diameter. Seven nails were 12.5 mm in diameter. Intramedullary skeletal kinetic distractor was used in 18 femurs and PRECICE in 13 femurs. Ten segments (7 intramedullary skeletal kinetic distractor; 3 PRECICE) experienced 13 complications. None of the patients developed AVN or proximal femoral deformity. CONCLUSIONS: IM lengthening nails inserted through the greater trochanter may be utilized in skeletally immature patients without increased risk of AVN of the femoral head or proximal femoral deformity. Larger trials would be helpful to confirm our hypothesis. We recommend careful surgical technique with liberal use of the image intensifier to avoid trauma to the femoral head blood supply. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV-therapeutic.
38287909	Evaluation of simultaneous bilateral femoral distraction osteogenesis with antegrade intramedullary lengthening nails in achondroplasia with rhizomelic short stature: a retrospective study of 15 patients with a minimum follow-up of 2 years.	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Bilateral femoral distraction osteogenesis in patients with achondroplasia is insufficiently reported. We aimed to perform the first study that exclusively analyzed simultaneous bilateral femoral distraction osteogenesis with motorized intramedullary lengthening nails via an antegrade approach in patients with achondroplasia focused on reliability, accuracy, precision, and the evolving complications. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this retrospective singlecenter study we analyzed patients with achondroplasia who underwent simultaneous bilateral femoral lengthening with antegrade intramedullary lengthening nails between October 2014 and April 2019. 15 patients (30 femoral segments) of median age 14 years (interquartile range [IQR] 12-15) were available for analysis. The median follow-up was 29 months (IQR 27-37) after nail implantation. RESULTS: The median distraction length per segment was 49 mm (IQR 47-51) with a median distraction index of 1.0 mm/day (IQR 0.9-1.0), and a median consolidation index of 20 days/cm (IQR 17-23). Reliability of the lengthening nails was 97% and their calculated accuracy and precision were 96% and 95%, respectively. The most common complication was temporary restriction of knee range of motion during distraction in 10 of 30 of the lengthened segments. 1 patient was treated with 2 unplanned additional surgeries due to premature consolidation. CONCLUSION: The method is reliable and accurate with few complications.
27636099	An ICF-CY-based approach to assessing self- and observer-reported functioning in young persons with achondroplasia - development of the pilot version of the Achondroplasia Personal Life Experience Scale (APLES).	PURPOSE: Achondroplasia is the most common disproportionate short stature which impacts patients' well-being. Little is known about the burden of disease in terms of functioning of patients and few disease-specific patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures exist. To understand the consequences of achondroplasia, the objective of the study was to develop an achondroplasia-specific PRO tool. METHOD: Focus group discussions including 34 German patients (age 8-18 years) and 21 parents were conducted and qualitatively analyzed. To identify relevant concepts, statements were coded according to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health: Children & Youth version (ICF-CY). Upon condensation, relevant statements were reformulated as items. RESULTS: 1950 statements related to 125 ICF-CY categories were identified. After condensation and prioritization, 59 items were retained. These were generated based on the ICF-CY domains environmental factors (27 items), activities and participation (18 items), body functions (9 items), and body structures (5 items). CONCLUSIONS: A new instrument, the Achondroplasia Personal Life Experience Scale (APLES) to assess burden of disease and functioning from the patients perspective of children and adolescents with achondroplasia has been developed in its pilot version based on the classification of the ICF-CY. Psychometric performance of the APLES is currently being examined. Implications for Rehabilitation Using the ICF-CY within the development of a disease-specific instrument to assess burden of disease and functioning provides guidance for clinicians and researchers in the selection of appropriate instruments complying with ICF categories. Qualitative research based on focus group interviews is an effective method to elicit experiences, beliefs, points of view, understandings, perceptions, impressions, needs and concerns as well as attitudes from the perspective of the individuals on a specific topic such as functioning. Direct assessment of the patient perspective is necessary to thoroughly understand a patient's experience of disease and treatment, the impact on their functioning and relevant health-care needs. Including the perspective of the patient and its family is an important component in the provision of health-care services. Patient-reported outcomes are not only important for the development of interventions and the use in clinical trials but can also be used in medical decision-making processes.
31743291	Acute Implant-related Complications in Pediatric Cervical Spine Fusion.	BACKGROUND: The use of modern rigid instrumentation in pediatric cervical fusions decreases the risk of implant-related complications, both acute and long term. However, previous studies have indicated that acute implant-related issues still occur in the adult population. Reports of pediatric acute implant complications, occurring within 3 months of surgery, are under-represented in the literature. The purpose of this study is to document the prevalence of acute implant-related complications in a pediatric cervical fusion population. METHODS: A retrospective review of instrumented cervical fusions from August 2002 to December 2018 was conducted. Acute implant-related complications were defined as malposition, fracture, or disengagement of cervical instrumentation, including screws, rods, and plates, within 90 days of surgery. RESULTS: A total of 166 cases were included (55% male individuals) with an average age at surgery of 12.5 years (SD, +-5.28). Acute implant-related complications occurred in 5 patients (3%). All 5 patients had a syndromic diagnosis: Loeys-Dietz (n=1), osteopetrosis (n=1), neurofibromatosis (n=1), trisomy 20 (n=1), and achondroplasia (n=1). One case involved asymptomatic screw protrusion, 1 case lateral mass screw pull-out, 2 more had screw-rod disengagement, and the last experienced dislodgement of the anterior plate. The median time until the presentation was 25 days (range, 1 to 79 d). All patients (n=5) required surgical revision. CONCLUSIONS: This case series suggests that the overall incidence of acute cervical implant failure is low. However, failure is more likely to occur in patients with underlying syndromes compared with patients with different etiologies. Intraoperative use of 3-dimensional computed tomography imaging is recommended to evaluate the screw position and potentially avoid later surgery.
26530664	Bilateral humeral lengthening in achondroplasia with unilateral external fixators: is it safe and does it improve daily life?	A retrospective study was performed in 18 patients with achondroplasia, who underwent bilateral humeral lengthening between 2001 and 2013, using monorail external fixators. The mean age was ten years (six to 15) and the mean follow-up was 40 months (12 to 104). The mean disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand (DASH) score fell from 32.3 (20 to 40) pre-operatively to 9.4 (6 to 14) post-operatively (p = 0.037). A mean lengthening of 60% (40% to 95%) was required to reach the goal of independent perineal hygiene. One patient developed early consolidation, and fractures occurred in the regenerate bone of four humeri in three patients. There were three transient radial nerve palsies. Humeral lengthening increases the independence of people with achondroplasia and is not just a cosmetic procedure.
29070618	Successful obstetric and anaesthetic management of a pregnant woman with achondroplasia.	Achondroplasia is the most prevalent form of dwarfism, and there is little evidence about the optimal management of pregnant women with achondroplasia. We presented a 25-year-old primigravid woman with achondroplasia who was followed up during the pregnancy period and performed elective caesarean section with combined spinal-epidural anaesthesia at the 38th week of gestation. Frequent obstetric follow-up visits and invasive prenatal diagnostic tests should be offered during the antenatal period due to the increased risk for obstetric complications, such as premature delivery and fetal anomalies. Prenatal detailed counselling, comprehensive evaluation of the potential risks, obstetric and perioperative management should be performed by a multidisciplinary care team, including an obstetrician, anaesthesiologist, pulmonologist, cardiologist and neonatologist.
37156065	Current and emerging therapies for Achondroplasia: The dawn of precision medicine.	Achondroplasia is a rare disease affecting bone growth and is caused by a missense mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene. In the past few years, there were multiple experimental drugs entering into clinical trials for treating achondroplasia including vosoritide, the first precision medicine approved for this indication. This perspective presents the mechanism of action, benefit, and potential mechanistic limitation of the drugs currently being evaluated in clinical trials for achondroplasia. This article also discusses the potential impact of those drugs not only in increasing the growth of individuals living with achondroplasia but also in improving their quality of life.
25650377	Neutral endopeptidase-resistant C-type natriuretic peptide variant represents a new therapeutic approach for treatment of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3-related dwarfism.	Achondroplasia (ACH), the most common form of human dwarfism, is caused by an activating autosomal dominant mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor-3 gene. Genetic overexpression of C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), a positive regulator of endochondral bone growth, prevents dwarfism in mouse models of ACH. However, administration of exogenous CNP is compromised by its rapid clearance in vivo through receptor-mediated and proteolytic pathways. Using in vitro approaches, we developed modified variants of human CNP, resistant to proteolytic degradation by neutral endopeptidase, that retain the ability to stimulate signaling downstream of the CNP receptor, natriuretic peptide receptor B. The variants tested in vivo demonstrated significantly longer serum half-lives than native CNP. Subcutaneous administration of one of these CNP variants (BMN 111) resulted in correction of the dwarfism phenotype in a mouse model of ACH and overgrowth of the axial and appendicular skeletons in wild-type mice without observable changes in trabecular and cortical bone architecture. Moreover, significant growth plate widening that translated into accelerated bone growth, at hemodynamically tolerable doses, was observed in juvenile cynomolgus monkeys that had received daily subcutaneous administrations of BMN 111. BMN 111 was well tolerated and represents a promising new approach for treatment of patients with ACH. 
31269546	C-Type Natriuretic Peptide Analogue Therapy in Children with Achondroplasia.	BACKGROUND: Achondroplasia is a genetic disorder that inhibits endochondral ossification, resulting in disproportionate short stature and clinically significant medical complications. Vosoritide is a biologic analogue of C-type natriuretic peptide, a potent stimulator of endochondral ossification. METHODS: In a multinational, phase 2, dose-finding study and extension study, we evaluated the safety and side-effect profile of vosoritide in children (5 to 14 years of age) with achondroplasia. A total of 35 children were enrolled in four sequential cohorts to receive vosoritide at a once-daily subcutaneous dose of 2.5 mug per kilogram of body weight (8 patients in cohort 1), 7.5 mug per kilogram (8 patients in cohort 2), 15.0 mug per kilogram (10 patients in cohort 3), or 30.0 mug per kilogram (9 patients in cohort 4). After 6 months, the dose in cohort 1 was increased to 7.5 mug per kilogram and then to 15.0 mug per kilogram, and in cohort 2, the dose was increased to 15.0 mug per kilogram; the patients in cohorts 3 and 4 continued to receive their initial doses. At the time of data cutoff, the 24-month dose-finding study had been completed, and 30 patients had been enrolled in an ongoing long-term extension study; the median duration of follow-up across both studies was 42 months. RESULTS: During the treatment periods in the dose-finding and extension studies, adverse events occurred in 35 of 35 patients (100%), and serious adverse events occurred in 4 of 35 patients (11%). Therapy was discontinued in 6 patients (in 1 because of an adverse event). During the first 6 months of treatment, a dose-dependent increase in the annualized growth velocity was observed with vosoritide up to a dose of 15.0 mug per kilogram, and a sustained increase in the annualized growth velocity was observed at doses of 15.0 and 30.0 mug per kilogram for up to 42 months. CONCLUSIONS: In children with achondroplasia, once-daily subcutaneous administration of vosoritide was associated with a side-effect profile that appeared generally mild. Treatment resulted in a sustained increase in the annualized growth velocity for up to 42 months.

21838822	Functional performance in young Australian children with achondroplasia.	AIM: The aim of this study was to determine population-specific developmental milestones for independence in self-care, mobility, and social cognitive skills in children with achondroplasia, the most common skeletal dysplasia. METHODS: Population-based recruitment from October 2008 to October 2010 identified 44 Australian children with achondroplasia aged 3 to 7 years. Consenting parents of 35 children (16 males, 19 females 14 aged 3y; 12 aged 5y; nine aged 7y) reported their child's self-care, mobility, and social cognition function using the Functional Independence Measure for Children (WeeFIM-II) at the ages of 3 (n=14), 5 (n=12), or 7 (n=9) years. Children were excluded from the study if they had an additional neurological or musculoskeletal condition. RESULTS: Functioning improved in children with achondroplasia between the ages of 3 and 5 years, but not subsequently. Milestones in the achondroplasia group were delayed across all ages and domains compared with normative reference data. Children with achondroplasia required greater caregiver assistance for self-care and mobility skills than typically developing children based on normative data. Social cognition appeared to be an area of relative strength. INTERPRETATION: Children up to 7 years of age with achondroplasia show delayed milestone acquisition and a greater need for caregiver assistance for all domains. As functional delays are likely to be related to common musculoskeletal impairments associated with achondroplasia, access to physiotherapists, occupational therapists, and speech and language pathologists skilled in achondroplasia management may assist children and families to become more independent, particularly around the time of starting school.
37701936	Predictors of NIV-related adverse events in children using long-term noninvasive ventilation.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: An increasing number of children with diverse medical conditions are using long-term noninvasive ventilation (NIV). This study examined the impact of demographic, clinical, and technology-related factors on long-term NIV adverse events in a large cohort of children using long-term NIV. METHODS: This was a multicenter retrospective review of all children who initiated long-term NIV in the province of Alberta, Canada, from January 2005 to September 2014, and followed until December 2015. Inclusion criteria were children who had used NIV for 3 months or more and had at least one follow-up visit with the NIV programs. RESULTS: We identified 507 children who initiated NIV at a median age of 7.5 (interquartile range: 8.6) years and 93% of them reported at least one NIV-related adverse event during the initial follow-up visit. Skin injury (20%) and unintentional air leaks (19%) were reported more frequently at the initial visit. Gastrointestinal symptoms, midface hypoplasia, increased drooling, aspiration and pneumothorax were rarely reported (<5%). Younger age and underlying conditions such as Down syndrome, achondroplasia, and Duchenne muscular dystrophy were early predictors of unintentional air leak. Younger age also predicted child sleep disruption in the short term and ongoing parental sleep disruption. Obesity was a risk factor for persistent nasal symptoms. Mask type was not a significant predictor for NIV-related short- or long-term complications. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that NIV-related complications are frequent. Appropriate mask-fitting and headgear adaptation, and a proactive approach to early detection may help to reduce adverse events.

35471200	What Are the Risks and Functional Outcomes Associated With Bilateral Humeral Lengthening Using a Monolateral External Fixator in Patients With Achondroplasia?	BACKGROUND: Many patients with achondroplasia experience functional impairments because of rhizomelic upper extremities (proximal limb shortening). Bilateral humeral lengthening may overcome these functional limitations, but it is associated with several risks, such as radial nerve palsy and insufficient bone regeneration. Only a few studies have reported on patient satisfaction and functional outcome after humeral lengthening in patients with achondroplasia. Furthermore, the reported numbers of adverse events associated with lengthening procedures using external fixators vary widely. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Does bilateral humeral lengthening with a monolateral external fixator in patients with achondroplasia reliably improve patient function and autonomy, and what proportion of patients achieved at least 8 cm of humeral lengthening? (2) What adverse events occur after bilateral humeral lengthening with monolateral external fixators? METHODS: Between 2011 and 2019, 44 patients underwent humeral lengthening at our institution. Humeral lengthening was performed in patients with severe shortening of the upper extremities and functional impairments. In humeri in which intramedullary devices were not applicable, lengthening was performed with monolateral external fixators in 40 patients. Eight patients were excluded because they underwent unilateral lengthening for etiologies other than achondroplasia, and another four patients did not fulfill the minimum study follow-up period of 2 years, leaving 28 patients with bilateral humeral lengthening to treat achondroplasia available for analysis in this retrospective study. The patients had a median (interquartile range) age of 8 years (8 to 10), and 50% (14 of 28) were girls. The median follow-up time was 6 years (4 to 8). The median humeral lengthening was 9 cm (9 to 10) with a median elongation of 73% (67% to 78%) from an initial median length of 12 cm (11 to 13). To determine whether this treatment reliably improved patient function and autonomy, surgeons retrospectively evaluated patient charts. An unvalidated retrospective patient-reported outcome measure questionnaire consisting of nine items (with answers of "yes" or "no" or a 5-point Likert scale) was administered to assess the patient's functional improvement in activities of daily living, physical appearance, and overall satisfaction, such that 45 points was the highest possible score. The radiographic outcome was assessed on calibrated radiographs of the humerus. To ascertain the proportion of adverse events, study surgeons performed a chart review and telephone interviews. Major complications were defined as events that resulted in unplanned revision surgery, nerve injury (either temporary or permanent), refracture of the bone regenerate, or permanent functional sequelae. Minor complications were characterized as events that resolved without further surgical interventions. RESULTS: On our unvalidated assessment of patient function and independence, all patients reported improvement at their most recent follow-up compared with scores obtained before treatment (median [IQR] 24 [16 to 28] before surgery versus 44 [42 to 45] at latest follow-up, difference of medians 20 points, p < 0.001). A total of 89% (25 of 28) of patients achieved the desired 8 cm of lengthening in both arms. A total of 50% (14 of 28) of our patients experienced a major complication. Specifically, 39% (11 of 28) had an unplanned reoperation, 39% (11 of 28) had a radial nerve palsy, 18% (5 of 28) had a refracture of the regenerate, and 4% (1 of 28) concluded treatment with a severe limb length discrepancy. In addition, 82% (23 of 28) of our patients experienced minor complications that resolved without further surgery and did not involve radial nerve symptoms. Radial nerve palsy was observed immediately postoperatively in eight of 13 segments, and 1 to 7 days postoperatively in five of 13 segments. The treatment goal was not achieved because of radial nerve palsy in 5% (3 of 56) of lengthened segments, which occurred in 7% (2 of 28) of patients. Full functional recovery of the radial nerve was observed in all patients after a median (IQR) of 3 months (2 to 5). Refractures of bone regenerates were observed in 11% (6 of 56) of humeri in 18% (5 of 28) of patients. Of those refractures, 1 of 6 patients was treated nonsurgically with a hanging cast, while 5 of 6 patients underwent revision surgery with intramedullary rodding. CONCLUSION: Most patients with achondroplasia who underwent humeral lengthening achieved the treatment goal without permanent sequelae; nonetheless, complications of treatment were common, and the road to recovery was long and often complicated, with many patients experiencing problems that were either painful (such as refracture) or bothersome (such as temporary radial nerve palsy). However, using a subjective scale, patients seemed improved after treatment; nevertheless, robust outcomes tools are not available for this condition, and so we must interpret that finding with caution. Considering our discoveries, bilateral humeral lengthening with a monolateral external fixator should only be considered in patients with severe functional impairments because of rhizomelic shortening of the upper extremities. If feasible, internal lengthening devices might be preferable, as these are generally associated with higher patient comfort and decreased complication rates compared with external fixators. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, therapeutic study.
24979866	[Anesthetic management for caesarean delivery in a parturient with achondroplasia].	A 27-year-old parturient (height, 130 cm; weight, 43 kg) with achondroplasia, which is characterized by rhizomeric short stature, large head and frontal bossing, was scheduled for elective caesarean section (C/S) because of her contracted pelvis. Her first delivery had been performed by C/S under general anesthesia at a regional hospital 6 years before. Preoperative airway assessment showed normal mouth opening and mobile cervical spine. Since she had anxiety about needle puncture and refused neuraxial blockade and since we considered the trachea could be intubated, we decided to perform C/S under general anesthesia at 37 weeks of gestation. The patient and baby had an uneventful perioperative course. Underdevelopment of bone formation results in characteristic craniofacial and vertebral abnormalities in patients with achondroplasia. Anesthetic management of achondroplastic parturients should be specified to individual basis based on careful preoperative assessment of craniofacial and vertebral deformities.
32650724	A case of successful coronary angioplasty in an achondroplasia patient with total occlusion of an anomalous right coronary artery (case report).	BACKGROUND: Coronary interventions in patients of achondroplasia have been reported rarely in the medical literature. Due to short stature and kyphoscoliosis, endovascular access (Cannulation) of the coronary arteries is usually extremely difficult in such patients. CASE PRESENTATION: A 33 years old patient, a known case of achondroplasia, presented with epigastric pain for 3 h duration to a university hospital, Sudan. Her height was 95 cm and her weight was 38 Kg. A trans-femoral approach for coronary angioplasty was preferred. After it has been extremely difficult to cannulate the left system at first, the cannulation has been performed successfully using 5F, JL3.5 catheter. The angiogram depicted total occlusion of the proximal right coronary artery which was found to be originating from the left coronary sinus of the aorta. Successful trans-femoral coronary angioplasty has been performed with stent placement, and no complications encountered. During her last follow up, 1 year after the procedure, she appeared to be free of symptoms and with no further ischemic attacks or procedure-related complications. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of successful coronary angioplasty in achondroplasia patient in whom the occluded artery is an anomalous coronary artery. Literature review, description of the achondroplasia, development of the coronary arteries and the hypothesized theory for the anomaly have been described in this case report. The PCI performed has also been clearly and comprehensively described.

31727132	Obesity in achondroplasia patients: from evidence to medical monitoring.	Achondroplasia is a rare genetic disease representing the most common form of short-limb dwarfism. It is characterized by bone growth abnormalities that are well characterized and by a strong predisposition to abdominal obesity for which causes are unknown. Despite having aroused interest at the end of the 20 h century, there are still only very little data available on this aspect of the pathology. Today, interest is rising again, and some studies are now proposing mechanistic hypotheses and guidance for patient management. These data confirm that obesity is a major health problem in achondroplasia necessitating an early yet complex clinical management. Anticipatory care should be directed at identifying children who are at high risk to develop obesity and intervening to prevent the metabolic complications in adults. In this review, we are regrouping available data characterizing obesity in achondroplasia and we are identifying the current tools used to monitor obesity in these patients.
38091071	Alteration of major venous drainage routes in a patient with achondroplasia after ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement.	Achondroplasia is the most common form of dwarfism, caused by a mutation in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 gene, leading to multiple pathological conditions. Herein, we present a case of an infant with achondroplasia associated with hydrocephalus and severe foramen magnum stenosis. Computed tomography (CT) venography showed prominent suboccipital emissary veins comprising major venous drainage routes and hypoplastic transverse sinuses, which increased the risk of foramen magnum decompression. The infant was initially treated with ventriculo-peritoneal (VP) shunt. After 8 months, CT venography showed regression of suboccipital emissary veins and more prominent transverse sinuses. Subsequently, foramen magnum decompression was safely performed without sacrificing major venous drainage routes.
36299173	A 66-Year-Old Woman with Achondroplasia and Quadriparesis with an Ovarian Cyst Erroneously Diagnosed as Urinary Retention by an Automated Bladder Scan.	BACKGROUND Automated bladder scanning has become a principal tool in the assessment and management of chronically debilitated patients residing in skilled nursing facilities, hospices, and acute inpatient settings. To a large extent, the bladder scan, generally performed by nursing staff, has replaced physical examination while addressing the differential diagnoses of anuria or voiding disturbances that require consideration of urinary catheterization. Health care providers can quickly master this easily performed technique, and currently, due to confidence in the bladder scan finding, physical examination with suprapubic palpation and percussion may be carelessly omitted. The case description presented here illustrates how not performing a physical examination can lead to misdiagnosis caused by misinterpretation of bladder scan findings. CASE REPORT A 66-year-old, quadriparetic, chronically ventilated female patient with achondroplasia underwent repeated hospital referrals and bladder catheterizations for presumed flaccid, neurogenic bladder with urinary retention. This postulated diagnosis was based on occasional reports of urinary catheter obstruction as well as on automated bladder scanning indicating a markedly distended bladder. However, the bladder could not be drained by insertion of urinary catheters. Eventually, a proper physical examination excluded the presence of suprapubic fullness compatible with distended bladder and contradicting bladder scan findings, prompting re-examining an overlooked evaluation of computed tomography that reported a huge ovarian cyst. The patient was found to have intact voiding capabilities and is now weaned from the catheter. CONCLUSIONS This case and the literature review underscore drawbacks in automated bladder scanning. This technique should be used as an adjunctive measure rather than a replacement for a physical examination in the evaluation of voiding disturbances, especially when there are discrepancies between bladder scan findings and the volume of urine drained by catheterization.
28364903	Long-term follow-up of a patient with achondroplasia treated with an orthodontic approach.	We successfully treated a patient with achondroplasia with conventional orthodontic techniques. It was followed by long-term retention. The patient, a 12-year-old boy, had chief complaints of occlusal disturbance and mandibular protrusion. He had been diagnosed with achondroplasia and had growth hormone treatment in his early teenage years. His facial profile was concave with a bulging forehead and a retrognathic maxilla. It was characterized by a skeletal Class III jaw-base relationship with a retropositioned maxilla. At the age of 12 years 9 months, maxillary protraction was initiated with a reverse headgear; for 2 years 6 months, the maxillomandibular growth was controlled. After the growth spurt, at the age of 15 years 6 months, leveling and alignment of both dental arches were started with preadjusted edgewise appliances. After 83 months of multibracket treatment, an acceptable occlusion with a Class I molar relationship and an adequate interincisal relationship was achieved, despite the simultaneous marked vertical growth of the mandible. The resultant occlusion was stable during a 6-year retention period, although considerable forward-downward mandibular growth was observed. Conclusively, our results indicated the necessity of long-term observation in this patient with achondroplasia, especially because of the persistent mandibular growth.
32450891	High prevalence of symptomatic spinal stenosis in Norwegian adults with achondroplasia: a population-based study.	BACKGROUND: Symptomatic spinal stenosis (SSS) is a well-known medical complication in achondroplasia. The reported prevalence of SSS is 10 to 30%, an estimate based on small studies or selected populations. No population-based studies exist currently. Furthermore, the relationship between SSS and physical functioning has not been investigated in detail. The aims of this study were to describe the prevalence of SSS in Norwegian adults with achondroplasia, and to explore the impact of SSS on physical functioning. METHODS: This was a population-based study on Norwegian community-dwelling adults with genetically confirmed achondroplasia. Prevalence of SSS was defined by clinical symptoms, and confirmed by imaging or surgical reports. Physical functioning was assessed by walking capacity (6-min walk test), hand strength (Grippit), and activities of daily living (the Health Assessment Questionnaire, HAQ). Pain was assessed by pain site locations and intensity (Numeric Rating Scale, NRS). RESULTS: In total, 50 participants were included (27 males, 23 females). Median age was 41 years (range 16 to 87 years), 34 (68%) had SSS. The estimated median age at first symptom onset was 33 years (95% confidence interval (CI) 29 to 43 years), range 10 to 67 years. The majority had multiple spinal levels affected. The walking distance was 110 m shorter in the SSS group (95% CI - 172 to - 40 m) as compared with the non-SSS group (p < 0.01). There was no considerable difference in hand strength between the two groups. Mean HAQ scores (0-3) for walking and hygiene were significantly higher in the SSS group, reflecting more activity limitations. Mean differences were 0.9 (95% CI 0.3 to 1.4, p < 0.01) and 0.6 (95% CI 0.2 to 1.0, p < 0.01). Pain intensity (NRS 0-10) was also significantly higher in the SSS group with a mean difference of 3.2 (95% CI 0.6 to 5.6, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: SSS was highly prevalent in Norwegian adults with achondroplasia, with symptom onset at young age, and multiple spinal levels affected. The presence of SSS was associated with reduced walking distance, activity limitations, and more pain. The findings underline the importance of thorough assessment and monitoring of SSS in achondroplasia, including a formal assessment of physical functioning.
34431071	Pharmacokinetics and Exposure-Response of Vosoritide in Children with Achondroplasia.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Vosoritide, an analog of C-type natriuretic peptide, has been developed for the treatment of children with achondroplasia. The pharmacokinetics of vosoritide and relationships between plasma exposure and efficacy, biomarkers, and safety endpoints were evaluated in a phase II, open-label, dose-escalation study (N = 35 patients aged 5-14 years who received daily subcutaneous injections for 24 months) and a phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (N = 60 patients aged 5-18 years randomized to receive daily subcutaneous injections for 52 weeks). METHODS: Pharmacokinetic parameters for both studies were obtained from non-compartmental analysis. Potential correlations between vosoritide exposure and changes in annualized growth velocity, collagen type X marker (CXM; a biomarker of endochondral ossification), cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP; a biomarker of pharmacological activity), heart rate, and systolic and diastolic blood pressures were then evaluated. RESULTS: The exposure-response relationships for changes in both annualized growth velocity and the CXM biomarker saturated at 15 mug/kg, while systemic pharmacological activity, as measured by urinary cGMP, was near maximal or saturated at exposures obtained at the highest dose studied (i.e. 30 mug/kg). This suggested that the additional bioactivity was likely in tissues not related to endochondral bone formation. In the phase III study, following subcutaneous administration at the recommended dose of 15 mug/kg to patients with achondroplasia aged 5-18 years, vosoritide was rapidly absorbed with a median time to maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) of 15 minutes, and cleared with a mean half-life of 27.9 minutes after 52 weeks of treatment. Vosoritide exposure (Cmax and area under the concentration-time curve [AUC]) was consistent across visits. No evidence of accumulation with once-daily dosing was observed. Total anti-vosoritide antibody (TAb) responses were detected in the serum of 25 of 60 (42%) treated patients in the phase III study, with no apparent impact of TAb development noted on annualized growth velocity or vosoritide exposure. Across the exposure range obtained with 15 microg/kg in the phase III study, no meaningful correlations between vosoritide plasma exposure and changes in annualized growth velocity or CXM, or changes from predose heart rate, and systolic or diastolic blood pressures were observed. CONCLUSIONS: The results support the recommended dose of vosoritide 15 microg/kg for once-daily subcutaneous administration in patients with achondroplasia aged >= 5 years whose epiphyses are not closed.

25303936	[Some features of the nose in craniofacial malformations].	In craniofacial malformations, the nose is variably affected: in its location, its shape or by lack of development. In this short chapter, some of the common problems encountered by the specialized teams are summarized. Craniofacial astronomies can modify the skeleton of the nose during growth, sometime at an early age. However, most rhinoplasties are performed at adulthood. The nasal pyramid may present deformations that produce functional and aesthetics impairment that should be treated when necessary. Respiratory problems should be recognized as early as possible and treated in priority. 
29055384	The central nervous system pressure histogram in hydrocephalus and hydromyelia.	This work makes proposals on the relationship between intracranial pressure (ICP) and hydrocephalus that changes over time with the evolution of the disease. This includes the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) filling mechanism that leads to an increase in mode pressure if excess fluid volume exacerbates the obstructive process. Elevation in mode occurs because pressure in the central nervous system (CNS) represents a state of reduced flow, rather than an abnormality of volume. Diseases that cause elevated mode pressure by means of a primary edema can lead to hydrocephalus if there is sufficient time and obstruction to flow for the filling mechanism to act. Hydrocephalus is driven primarily by labile pressure due to restricted compliance, it can expand skeletal compartments and deplete parenchyma volume as it advances. This hypothesis applies existing principles of water balance. It is part of a series of works that propose a spectrum of hydrocephalic disorders including developmental forms such as achondroplasia with other conditions such as functional trapped fourth ventricle, arachnoid cyst, syringomyelia and normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). Links between the conditions can be made by understanding the continuously variable pressure profile local to the cavity that is subject to filling. Fluid lesions of the brain or spine that arise from developmental malformations of the skull have a physiological component. Changes form part of the mechanisms that may compensate the disease process.

35654849	Spinal canal stenosis in children with achondroplasia: the role of augmentation laminoplasty-a 15-year single institution experience.	PURPOSE: Achondroplasia typically results in compressive spinal canal stenosis in one-third of children, but rare under the age of 15 years. Laminectomy is the mainstay of treatment but this leads to instability and progressive deformity requiring complex fixation. In order to reduce that risk, we developed a novel modified augmented laminoplasty that increases spinal canal diameter while preserving the posterior column stability. METHODS: All laminoplasty cases for spinal compressive achondroplasia from 2006 to 2020 were included. Ten augmentation laminoplasty procedures were performed in 7 children with regular clinical and radiological post-operative follow-up. Kyphotic deformity and clinical outcomes (neurological and urological) were evaluated. RESULTS: At presentation, clinical features included radiculopathy, neurogenic claudication or acute cauda equina compression with sphincter dysfunction. The average age at initial surgery was 11.2 (range 5-16) with a mean follow-up of 5 (range 2-8) years. All patients demonstrated improvement in neurogenic claudication symptoms after surgery; however, bladder dysfunction persisted in some children. In one child, cervical and lumbar augmentation laminoplasties were performed for concomitant disease. Augmentation laminoplasty effectively prevented deformity progression over time in all cases except one where a further revision laminoplasty with extension was required for screw loosening. Despite this, progressive symptomatic kyphotic deformity led to a 360  fixation. Minor complications included one dural breach (repaired intraoperatively) and one superficial wound infection. CONCLUSION: Augmentation laminoplasty is a viable surgical option following laminectomy in achondroplasia patients as an alternative to surgical fixation. Fixation can be reserved for cases where there is progressive deformity and kyphosis.
36640151	Impact of paternal age on assisted reproductive technology outcomes and offspring health: a systematic review.	BACKGROUND: The increase in paternal age and the percentage of births after assisted reproductive technologies (ART) may have consequences on offspring and society's position regarding access to ART must be questioned. Most countries recommend limiting ART to men under 60 years. What is the rationale for this threshold? OBJECTIVE: This systematic review assesses scientific arguments to establish links between paternal age, male fertility, and offspring health. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Using the PRISMA guidelines, this systematic review of the literature analyzed 111 articles selected after screening PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science for articles published between January 1, 1995 and December 31, 2021. RESULTS: A strong correlation was highlighted between advanced paternal age and a decrease of some sperm parameters (semen volume and sperm motility) and infant morbidity (exponentially increased incidence of achondroplasia and Apert syndrome, and more moderately increased incidence of autism and schizophrenia). The impact of paternal age on pregnancy and fetal aneuploidy rates is more controversial. No association was found with spontaneous abortion rates. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The scientific parameters should be explained to older parents undergoing ART. And for countries that discuss a limit on paternal age for access to ART, the debate requires consideration of social and ethical arguments.
26046691	Progressive postnatal pansynostosis: an insidious and pernicious form of craniosynostosis.	OBJECT Progressive postnatal pansynostosis (PPP) is a rare form of craniosynostosis that is characterized by a normal head shape, insidious decrease in percentile head circumference, and high rates of elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). This investigation describes the clinical, radiographic, and genetic features of this entity. METHODS The authors' craniofacial database for the period 1997-2013 was retrospectively culled to identify patients who had a normal or near-normal head shape and CT-confirmed multiple-suture synostosis. Patients with kleeblatt-schadel or previous craniofacial surgery were excluded. All demographic information was collected and analyzed. RESULTS Seventeen patients fit the inclusion criteria. Nine patients had a syndromic diagnosis: Crouzon syndrome (n = 4), Pfeiffer syndrome (n = 2), Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (n = 1), Apert syndrome (n = 1), and achondroplasia (n = 1). With the exception of 3 patients with mild turricephaly, all patients had a relatively normal head shape. Patients were diagnosed at an average age of 62.9 months. Nearly all patients had some combination of clinical, radiographic, or ophthalmological evidence of increased ICP. CONCLUSIONS PPP is insidious; diagnosis is typically delayed because the clinical signs are subtle and appear gradually. All normocephalic infants or children with a known or suspected craniosynostotic disorder should be carefully monitored; any decrease in percentile head circumference or signs/symptoms of increased ICP should prompt CT evaluation. 
34282216	Evaluating the results of long tubular bone distraction with an advanced rod monolateral external fixator for achondroplasia.	The work aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the developed distraction system based on the rod external monolateral fixation mechanisms by comparing it with the classical technique of long tubular bones distraction based on the circular multi-axial system. The study included patients with a genetically confirmed diagnosis of achondroplasia. The experimental group consisted of 14 patients who underwent surgical limb lengthening by the rod monolateral external fixator with a distraction system developed by the authors. The lengthening was performed on 28 segments of tubular bones. The majority of the experimental group patients achieved the lengthening value close to the planned one and the deformation correction. The fixation period was averagely 83.8 +- 3.7 days, the regenerate length was 8.5 +- 0.6 cm, and the mechanical strength of the distraction regenerate was 10.3  +- 2.18 . The rod external fixator with a control distraction system developed by the authors has small dimensions and low weight of the external supporting elements of high durability. It is reported to provide a good psychological tolerance of the treatment process and significantly outperforms the circular multi-axis system. Considering the aforementioned, the proposed apparatus can grant good orthopedic care to patients with achondroplasia.
36728393	Hydrotherapy for Patients With External Fixation: Effect on Infectious Events.	BACKGROUND: Surgery to achieve long bone lengthening and deformity correction in skeletally immature patients is traditionally performed through external fixators. The incidence of infection during treatment is high. Hydrotherapy is highly beneficial during external fixation management, but the infection rates may impact its utilization. The objective of this paper is to document the incidence and duration of infection in patients who participated in a full hydrotherapy program when performed under medical supervision and in accordance with strict follow-up protocols. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we documented the key characteristics of patients who participated in hydrotherapy after lower limb external fixation surgery including age, sex, diagnosis and surgery site, the incidence and duration of pin site infections, and the percentage of cases, which were able to comply with a full hydrotherapy protocol. RESULTS: The hydrotherapy pool met all daily water quality metrics. Thirty-four children (19 males and 15 females) had a mean+-SD age of 10.9+-4.6 years. Of the cases, 80% were unilateral and 20% were bilateral. Diagnoses included congenital hereditary (eg, achondroplasia), congenital nonhereditary conditions (eg, fibular hemimelia), and acquired conditions (eg, traumatic). The location of osteotomy site was quite evenly spread between the femur and the tibia/fibula. Three out of the 34 patients were unable to receive hydrotherapy due to continuous secretions; 2 patients did not miss any sessions. The mean number of treatments was 3 per week. During the entire period, a total of 1200 treatments were performed for these patients with only 32 cancellations (about 3%) due to secretions or other signs of infection. Spearman correlation coefficients showed significantly high correlations between the duration of external fixation and the duration of hydrotherapy. There are no significant correlations between infections and other factors (sex, age segment, whether the problem is unilateral or /bilateral, diagnosis, and duration of treatment). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report, to our knowledge, that documents the low prevalence of infectious events during hydrotherapy treatment and demonstrates its feasibility. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III; retrospective, comparative study.
