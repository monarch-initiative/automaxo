input_text: 'Final adult height in long-term growth hormone-treated achondroplasia
  patients. The objective of this study was to evaluate the gain in final height of
  achondroplasia (ACH) patients with long-term growth hormone (GH) treatment. We analyzed
  medical data of 22 adult patients (8 males and 14 females) treated with GH at a
  dose of 0.05 mg/kg/day. Optionally, tibial lengthening (TL) was performed with the
  Ilizalov method in 15 patients and TL as well as femoral lengthening (FL) in 6 patients.
  Concomitant gonadal suppression therapy with buserelin acetate was applied in 13
  patients. The mean treatment periods with GH were 10.7 +- 4.0 and 9.3 +- 2.5 years
  for males and females, respectively. GH treatment augmented the final height +0.60
  +- 0.52 SD (+3.5 cm) and +0.51 +- 1.29 SD (+2.8 cm) in males and females compared
  to non-treated ACH patients, respectively. Final height of ACH patients that underwent
  GH and TL increased +1.72 +- 0.72 SD (+10.0 cm) and +1.95 +- 1.34 SD (+9.8 cm) in
  males and females, respectively. GH, TL, and FL increased their final height +2.97
  SD (+17.2 cm) and +3.41 +- 1.63 SD (+17.3 cm) in males and females, respectively.
  Gonadal suppression therapy had no impact on final height. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term
  GH treatment contributes to 2.6 and 2.1% of final adult height in male and female
  ACH patients, respectively.'
