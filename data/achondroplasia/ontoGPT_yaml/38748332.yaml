input_text: European Achondroplasia Forum Practical Considerations for Following Adults
  with Achondroplasia. Achondroplasia is a lifelong condition requiring lifelong management.
  There is consensus that infants and children with achondroplasia should be managed
  by a multidisciplinary team experienced in the condition. However, many people are
  lost to follow-up after the transition from paediatric to adult care, and there
  is no standardised approach for management in adults, despite the recent availability
  of international consensus guidelines. To address this, the European Achondroplasia
  Forum has developed a patient-held checklist to support adults with achondroplasia
  in managing their health. The checklist highlights key symptoms of spinal stenosis
  and obstructive sleep apnoea, both among the most frequent and potentially severe
  medical complications in adults with achondroplasia. The checklist acts as a framework
  to support individuals and their primary care provider in completing a routine review.
  General advice on issues such as blood pressure, pain, hearing, weight, adaptive
  aids, and psychosocial aspects are also included. The checklist provides key symptoms
  to be aware of, in addition to action points so that people can approach their primary
  care provider and be directed to the appropriate specialist, if needed. Additionally,
  the European Achondroplasia Forum offers some ideas on implementing the checklist
  during the transition from paediatric to adult care, thus ensuring the existing
  multidisciplinary team model in place during childhood can support in engaging individuals
  and empowering them to take responsibility for their own care as they move into
  adulthood.
