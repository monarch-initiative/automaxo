input_text: 'Spinal canal stenosis in children with achondroplasia: the role of augmentation
  laminoplasty-a 15-year single institution experience. PURPOSE: Achondroplasia typically
  results in compressive spinal canal stenosis in one-third of children, but rare
  under the age of 15 years. Laminectomy is the mainstay of treatment but this leads
  to instability and progressive deformity requiring complex fixation. In order to
  reduce that risk, we developed a novel modified augmented laminoplasty that increases
  spinal canal diameter while preserving the posterior column stability. METHODS:
  All laminoplasty cases for spinal compressive achondroplasia from 2006 to 2020 were
  included. Ten augmentation laminoplasty procedures were performed in 7 children
  with regular clinical and radiological post-operative follow-up. Kyphotic deformity
  and clinical outcomes (neurological and urological) were evaluated. RESULTS: At
  presentation, clinical features included radiculopathy, neurogenic claudication
  or acute cauda equina compression with sphincter dysfunction. The average age at
  initial surgery was 11.2 (range 5-16) with a mean follow-up of 5 (range 2-8) years.
  All patients demonstrated improvement in neurogenic claudication symptoms after
  surgery; however, bladder dysfunction persisted in some children. In one child,
  cervical and lumbar augmentation laminoplasties were performed for concomitant disease.
  Augmentation laminoplasty effectively prevented deformity progression over time
  in all cases except one where a further revision laminoplasty with extension was
  required for screw loosening. Despite this, progressive symptomatic kyphotic deformity
  led to a 360  fixation. Minor complications included one dural breach (repaired
  intraoperatively) and one superficial wound infection. CONCLUSION: Augmentation
  laminoplasty is a viable surgical option following laminectomy in achondroplasia
  patients as an alternative to surgical fixation. Fixation can be reserved for cases
  where there is progressive deformity and kyphosis.'
