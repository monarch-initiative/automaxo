input_text: A rare case of percutaneous coronary intervention in achondroplasia. Achondroplastic
  individuals are associated with increased cardiac risk when compared to the general
  population. Coronary interventions in patients with achondroplasia have not been
  studied previously. We report the case of a 32-year-old male smoker with achondroplasia
  who presented with acute chest pain of 3 hours duration. He was diagnosed with acute
  inferior and right ventricular myocardial infarction and thrombolyzed with streptokinase.
  Since the patient continued to have pain and hypotension, he was taken for rescue
  percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Because of short stature and kyphoscoliosis,
  difficulties were faced in cannulating the coronaries and performing intervention.
  He had total occlusion of proximal right coronary artery, for which angioplasty
  with stenting was done. To our knowledge, this is the first case of PCI conducted
  in an achondroplastic patient.
