input_text: 'An audit on a routine antenatal nonstress testing program in pregnant
  women with preexisting diabetes. INTRODUCTION: The objective was to evaluate the
  effectiveness of routine (planned) antenatal nonstress tests (NSTs) in pregnant
  women with preexisting diabetes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective single-center
  study of 642 consecutive pregnancies in women with preexisting diabetes who gave
  birth to a singleton >=22 weeks. Weekly planned NSTs were commenced at 33-35 weeks.
  In pregnancies with maternal-fetal complications, the initiation and frequency of
  the planned NST were individualized. Daily maternal assessment of fetal activity
  was recommended from 28 weeks, and decreased fetal activity indicated an unplanned
  NST. Data were collected from medical records, and local and regional databases.
  RESULTS: In total, 3016 planned NSTs were performed, with a median of five (range
  0-12) tests per pregnancy. Ninety-five planned NSTs (3.1%) were abnormal, a finding
  confirmed by retesting the same day in eight cases (8.4%), thus leading to delivery.
  Complications were present in seven of these eight pregnancies, whereas no fetal
  movements for the last 3 days were reported when the planned NST was performed in
  the eighth pregnancy. When specifically asked, five of the eight women stated that
  they had observed decreased fetal activity preceding the planned NST. In 86 pregnancies
  (13.4%), maternal perception of decreased fetal activity indicated in total 127
  unplanned NSTs. The combination of decreased fetal activity and further obstetrical
  assessment led to delivery in 10 of these pregnancies (11.6%). One stillbirth occurred
  at 37 weeks in a pregnancy complicated by fetal achondroplasia and polyhydramnios,
  where the weekly planned NSTs had been normal. The overall stillbirth rate was thus
  1.6/1000. CONCLUSIONS: Routine use of planned antenatal NSTs does not appear to
  be indicated in pregnancies in women with preexisting diabetes in the absence of
  maternal-fetal complications.'
