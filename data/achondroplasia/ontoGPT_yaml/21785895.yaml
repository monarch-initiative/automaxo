input_text: "Is bilateral lower limb lengthening appropriate for achondroplasia?:
  midterm analysis of the complications and quality of life. BACKGROUND: Use of the
  Ilizarov technique for limb lengthening in patients with achondroplasia is controversial,
  with a high risk of complications balancing cosmetic gains. Although several articles
  have described the complications of this procedure and satisfaction of patients
  after surgery, it remains unclear whether lengthening improves the quality of life
  (QOL) of these patients. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked whether bilateral lower limb
  lengthenings with deformity correction in patients with achondroplasia would improve
  QOL and investigated the correlation between complication rate and QOL. PATIENTS
  AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 22 patients (average age, 12.7 years) diagnosed
  with achondroplasia who underwent bilateral lower limb lengthenings between 2002
  and 2005. These patients were compared with 22 patients with achondroplasia for
  whom limb lengthening was not performed. The two groups were assessed using the
  American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) lower limb, SF-36, and Rosenberg
  self-esteem scores. Minimum followup was 4.5 years (range, 4.5-6.9 years). RESULTS:
  Among the lengthening group, the average gain in length was 10.21 +- 2.39 cm for
  the femur and 9.13 +- 2.12 cm for the tibia. A total of 123 complications occurred
  in these 88 segments. The surgical group had higher Rosenberg self-esteem scores
  than the nonsurgical group although there were no differences in the AAOS and the
  SF-36 scores. The self-esteem scores decreased with the increase in the number of
  complications. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that despite frequent complications,
  bilateral lower limb lengthening increases patients' QOL. We believe lengthening
  is a reasonable option in selected patients. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, therapeutic
  study. See the Guidelines for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence."
