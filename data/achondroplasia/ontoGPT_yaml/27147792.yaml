input_text: 'Favorable Growth Hormone Treatment Response in a Young Boy with Achondroplasia.
  BACKGROUND: Achondroplasia is a skeletal dysplasia, the most common cause of rhizomelic
  dwarfism. CASE PRESENTATION: This is a ten year old boy who was first diagnosed
  prenatally. He had a mutation c1138G>A in the gene FGFR3 in a heterozygotic constellation.
  His IGF1 and IGFBP3 levels were normal. Two stimulation tests for growth hormone
  were performed with values within the reference range. His psychomotor development
  was adequate for his age except for speech difficulty. He started with recombinant
  hGH (r-hGH) at the age of 3.4 years in a dose of 0.06 mg/kg. His mean Height SDS
  (HtSDS) was -2.2. RESULTS: The growth increased to 10 cm/year in the first year
  of therapy (HtSDS -1.1). It decreased during the second year to 4 cm (HtSDS -1.7)
  and again increased during the third year to 8 cm/year (HtSDS-1.3). In the next
  years the growth was constant (6.5, 2.3, 3.5 cm / year). He is still growing in
  the 3(rd) percentile of the growth curve (HtSDS - 1.2) under GH treatment. The body
  disproportion remained the same. CONCLUSION: The growth response on GH treatment
  was satisfactory in the first 4 years of treatment, and the boy still continued
  to grow. The young age at the start of treatment was also of importance. Our other
  patients with achondroplasia who started treatment older had a poor response to
  growth hormone.'
