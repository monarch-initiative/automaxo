  and Practical Considerations for Clinical Practice. INTRODUCTION: Vosoritide is
  the first precision medical therapy approved to increase growth velocity in children
  with achondroplasia. Sharing early prescribing experiences across different regions
  could provide a framework for developing practical guidance for the real-world use
  of vosoritide. METHODS: Two meetings were held to gather insight and early experience
  from experts in Europe, the Middle East, and the USA. The group comprised geneticists,
  pediatric endocrinologists, pediatricians, and orthopedic surgeons. Current practices
  and considerations for vosoritide were discussed, including administration practicalities,
  assessments, and how to manage expectations. RESULTS: A crucial step in the management
  of achondroplasia is to determine if adequate multidisciplinary support is in place.
  Training for families is essential, including practical information on administration
  of vosoritide, and how to recognize and manage injection-site reactions. Advocated
  techniques include establishing a routine, empowering patients by allowing them
  to choose injection sites, and managing pain. Patients may discontinue vosoritide
  if they cannot tolerate daily injections or are invited to participate in a clinical
  trial. Clinicians in Europe and the Middle East emphasized the importance of assessing
  adherence to daily injections, as non-adherence may impact response and reimbursement.
  Protocols for monitoring patients receiving vosoritide may be influenced by regional
  differences in reimbursement and healthcare systems. Core assessments may include
  pubertal staging, anthropometry, radiography to confirm open physes, the review
  of adverse events, and discussion of concomitant or new medications-but timing of
  these assessments may also differ regionally and vary across institutions. Patients
  and families should be informed that response to vosoritide can vary in both magnitude
  and timing. Keeping families informed regarding vosoritide clinical trial data is
  encouraged. CONCLUSION: The early real-world experience with vosoritide is generally
  positive. Sharing these insights is important to increase understanding of the practicalities
  of treatment with vosoritide in the clinical setting.'
