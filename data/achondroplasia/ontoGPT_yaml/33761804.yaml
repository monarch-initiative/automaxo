input_text: 'Rationale, design, and methods of a randomized, controlled, open-label
  clinical trial with open-label extension to investigate the safety of vosoritide
  in infants, and young children with achondroplasia at risk of requiring cervicomedullary
  decompression surgery. Achondroplasia causes narrowing of the foramen magnum and
  the spinal canal leading to increased mortality due to cervicomedullary compression
  in infants and significant morbidity due to spinal stenosis later in adulthood.
  Vosoritide is a C-natriuretic peptide analogue that has been shown to improve endochondral
  ossification in children with achondroplasia. The objective of this trial is to
  evaluate the safety of vosoritide and whether vosoritide can improve the growth
  of the foramen magnum and spinal canal in children that may require decompression
  surgery. An Achondroplasia Foramen Magnum Score will be used to identify infants
  at risk of requiring decompression surgery. This is a 2-year open label randomized
  controlled trial of vosoritide in infants with achondroplasia ages 0 to <=12 months.
  Approximately 20 infants will be randomized 1:1 to either open label once daily
  subcutaneous vosoritide combined with standard of care or standard of care alone.
  The primary and secondary aims of the study are to evaluate the safety and efficacy
  of vosoritide in children with cervicomedullary compression at risk of requiring
  decompression surgery. The trial will be carried out in specialized skeletal dysplasia
  treatment centers with well established multidisciplinary care pathways and standardized
  approaches to the neurosurgical management of cervicomedually compression. After
  2 years, infants randomized to standard of care alone will be eligible to switch
  to vosoritide plus standard of care for an additional 3 years. This pioneering trial
  hopes to address the important question as to whether treatment with vosoritide
  at an early age in infants at risk of requiring cervicomedullary decompression surgery
  is safe, and can improve growth at the foramen magnum and spinal canal alleviating
  stenosis. This in turn may reduce compression of surrounding structures including
  the neuraxis and spinal cord, which could alleviate future morbidity and mortality.Trial
