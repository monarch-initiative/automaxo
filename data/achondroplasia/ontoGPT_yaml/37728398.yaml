input_text: 'Neurosurgical management of cervicomedullary compression, spinal stenosis,
  and hydrocephalus in pediatric achondroplasia: a systematic review. OBJECTIVE: Pediatric
  achondroplasia is often associated with conditions requiring neurosurgical intervention,
  including CSF diversion and multilevel spinal decompression. However, there is a
  lack of clinical guidelines and reliable estimates of the benefits and risks of
  these interventions. This study aimed to summarize the literature on the neurosurgical
  management of pediatric achondroplasia patients in order to aid in determining optimal
  treatment and standardization of care. METHODS: A systematic review of peer-reviewed
  studies with an objective diagnosis of achondroplasia, patient demographic information,
  and available data on neurosurgical interventions performed before 18 years of age
  for cervicomedullary compression, spinal stenosis, and hydrocephalus was performed.
  Study quality and risks of bias were assessed using standardized scores. Independent
  patient data on surgical indications, outcomes, reoperations, and complication risks
  were aggregated using means and percentages. RESULTS: Of 204 records, 25 studies
  with 287 pediatric achondroplasia patients (mean age 25 +- 36 months) treated for
  cervicomedullary compression (n = 153), spinal stenosis (n = 100), and obstructive
  hydrocephalus (n = 34) were evaluated. Symptomatic cervicomedullary compression
  occurred early in life (mean age 31 +- 25 months), with apnea (48%), T2-weighted
  MRI cord signal (28%), myelopathy (27%), and delayed motor skills (15%) requiring
  foramen magnum decompression observed in 99% of patients, as well as cervical laminectomy
  in 65% of patients. Although 91% of treated patients had resolution of symptoms,
  2% mortality, 9% reoperation, and 21% complication rates were reported. Spinal stenosis
  was treated in relatively older children (mean age 13 +- 3 years) with laminectomy
  (23%), as well as with instrumented fusion (73%) for neurogenic claudication (59%),
  back pain (15%), and sciatica (8%). Although 95% of patients had symptom resolution
  after surgery, 17% reported complications and 18% required reoperation. Of the hydrocephalus
  patients (mean age 56 +- 103 months), half were treated with endoscopic third ventriculostomy
  (ETV) and half had a shunt placed for progressive ventriculomegaly (66%), headaches
  (32%), and delayed cognitive development (4%). The shunted patients had a 3% mortality
  rate and an average of 1.5 shunt revisions per patient. None of the patients who
  underwent ETV as the primary procedure required a revision. CONCLUSIONS: Neurosurgical
  intervention for pediatric achondroplasia conditions, including cervicomedullary
  compression, spinal stenosis, and hydrocephalus, is associated with high recovery
  rates and good outcomes. However, complications and reoperations are common. Further
  studies with follow-up into adulthood are needed to evaluate the long-term outcomes.'
