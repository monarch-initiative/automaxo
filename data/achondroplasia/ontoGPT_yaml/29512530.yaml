input_text: '[Homeostasis and Disorder of Musculoskeletal System.Diagnosis and Treatment
  of Congenital Musculoskeletal Diseases.] Congenital skeletal dysplasias have been
  considered to be fundamentally untreatable diseases. However, molecular diagnosis
  by genetic testing has become more prevalent, and efforts are being made to develop
  novel therapies based on the pathogenesis. As treatments for osteogenesis imperfecta,
  in addition to anti-resorptive agents, neutralizing antibodies against sclerostin
  and transforming growth factor(TGF)-beta and chemical chaperones can be beneficial.
  Enzyme replacement therapy using bone-targeting recombinant alkaline phosphatase
  has been recently developed to treat hypophosphatasia and has much improved the
  prognosis of the patients affected with severe forms of the disease. To treat the
  severe short stature in achondroplasia, drugs targeting the fibroblast growth factor
  receptor 3(FGFR3)-mediated signal are in development for clinical use.'
