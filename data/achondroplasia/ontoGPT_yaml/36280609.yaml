input_text: 'Plate fixation after lengthening with an external fixator in patients
  with achondroplasia : A comparative study between two centers. BACKGROUND: This
  study compared internal fixation with a plate after lengthening (PAL) with an external
  fixator with the conventional method (CM) in terms of radiologic and clinical outcomes
  in the lower extremities of patients with achondroplasia. METHODS: In this study
  20 patients (50 lower extremity long bones) who underwent PAL or CM were divided
  into 2 cohort groups. The amount of lengthening, percentage lengthening, external
  fixator index (EFI), external fixator time, Li regeneration index, complication
  rate, and knee range of motion (ROM) were compared between the groups. RESULTS:
  The median age was 9.4 years (range 6-16 years) in the PAL group and 12 years (range
  9-16 years) in the CM group (p = 0.01). Males comprised 80% of the patients in the
  PAL group and 47% of the patients in the CM group (p = 0.02). The median amount
  of lengthening in the PAL and CM groups was 7.5 cm (range 5.5-9.5 cm) and 6.0 cm
  (range 5.5-9.0 cm), respectively (p < 0.01). The median percentage of lengthening
  in the PAL and CM groups was 44.6% (range 20.0-70.1%) and 43.0% (range 20.5-57.3%),
  respectively (p = 0.01). The median external fixator time in the PAL and CM groups
  was 127 days (range 94-185 days) and 180 days (range 105-355 days), respectively
  (p < 0.01). The median EFI in the PAL and CM groups was 21 days/cm (range 10-33
  days/cm) and 27 days/cm (range 15-59 days/cm), respectively (p < 0.01). The Li regeneration
  index was 3 (interquartile range, IQR 2-4) in both groups (p = 0.2). The total complication
  rate was similar between the groups. CONCLUSION: In patients with achondroplasia,
  after lengthening with an external fixator, internal fixation with a plate can be
  a reliable alternative to the conventional method. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III
