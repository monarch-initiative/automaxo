input_text: "Functional performance in young Australian children with achondroplasia.
  AIM: The aim of this study was to determine population-specific developmental milestones
  for independence in self-care, mobility, and social cognitive skills in children
  with achondroplasia, the most common skeletal dysplasia. METHODS: Population-based
  recruitment from October 2008 to October 2010 identified 44 Australian children
  with achondroplasia aged 3 to 7 years. Consenting parents of 35 children (16 males,
  19 females 14 aged 3y; 12 aged 5y; nine aged 7y) reported their child's self-care,
  mobility, and social cognition function using the Functional Independence Measure
  for Children (WeeFIM-II) at the ages of 3 (n=14), 5 (n=12), or 7 (n=9) years. Children
  were excluded from the study if they had an additional neurological or musculoskeletal
  condition. RESULTS: Functioning improved in children with achondroplasia between
  the ages of 3 and 5 years, but not subsequently. Milestones in the achondroplasia
  group were delayed across all ages and domains compared with normative reference
  data. Children with achondroplasia required greater caregiver assistance for self-care
  and mobility skills than typically developing children based on normative data.
  Social cognition appeared to be an area of relative strength. INTERPRETATION: Children
  up to 7 years of age with achondroplasia show delayed milestone acquisition and
  a greater need for caregiver assistance for all domains. As functional delays are
  likely to be related to common musculoskeletal impairments associated with achondroplasia,
  access to physiotherapists, occupational therapists, and speech and language pathologists
  skilled in achondroplasia management may assist children and families to become
  more independent, particularly around the time of starting school."
