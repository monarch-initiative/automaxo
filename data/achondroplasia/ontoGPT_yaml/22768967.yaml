input_text: "Neurogenic claudication associated with posterior vertebral rim fractures
  in children. OBJECT: Outside of the patient population with achondroplasia, neurogenic
  claudication is rare in the pediatric age group. Neurogenic claudication associated
  with posterior vertebral rim fracture is even more uncommon but nonetheless causes
  pain and disability in affected children and adolescents. The purpose of this study
  was to describe the surgical results of 3 adolescents presenting with neurogenic
  claudication and posterior vertebral rim fracture when treated with laminectomy
  alone. METHODS: The medical and operative records of the 3 pediatric patients were
  retrospectively reviewed. Presenting signs and symptoms and CT findings, such as
  the interpedicular distances between T-12 and L-5, were obtained. Perioperative
  results were assessed, including operative time, blood loss, length of hospital
  stay, and complications. Findings at latest follow-up were also recorded, including
  a patient satisfaction survey. RESULTS: The 3 patients (1 girl and 2 boys) had a
  mean age of 14.7 years (range 14-15 years) and underwent follow-up for a mean of
  11.3 months (range 5-18 months). Notable preoperative signs and symptoms included
  back pain (all patients), leg pain (all patients), leg numbness (1 patient), and
  leg weakness (1 patient). No patient presented with bowel and/or bladder dysfunction.
  The mean blood loss during laminectomy was 123 ml (range 20-300 ml), and the mean
  length of hospital stay was 4.3 days (range 3-6 days). On average, decompression
  was performed at 2.2 levels (range 2-2.5 levels). All 3 patients reported at most
  recent follow-up that they were \"satisfied\" with the surgery. There was 1 complication
  of instability from an iatrogenic pars fracture, which required reoperation and
  posterior instrumented fusion. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of the authors' knowledge,
  this report represents the first surgical series of pediatric neurogenic claudication
  associated with posterior vertebral rim fractures. Pediatric neurosurgeons may infrequently
  encounter neurogenic claudication associated with a posterior vertebral rim fracture
  in children. To treat children with neurogenic claudication associated with posterior
  vertebral rim fractures, a simple laminectomy may be a safe and efficacious alternative
  to discectomy and removal of fracture fragments."
