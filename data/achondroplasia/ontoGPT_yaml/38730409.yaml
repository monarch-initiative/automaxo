input_text: "Management of complete intra-articular distal femur and patellar fractures
  in an achondroplastic young adult; small is challenging' revisited: a case-report.
  BACKGROUND: People with achondroplasia exhibit distinct physical characteristics,
  but their cognitive abilities remain within the normal range. The challenges encountered
  during surgical procedures and perioperative care for achondroplastic individuals,
  are underrepresented in the existing literature. CASE PRESENTATION: In this report,
  the management of a 26-year-old North-African achondroplastic male is highlighted.
  The patient suffered a complete intra-articular distal femur fracture (AO/OTA 33-C1)
  and an ipsilateral patella fracture (AO/OTA 34-C1). The patient's unusual anatomical
  variations and the lack of suitable orthopedic implants posed significant surgical
  challenges, particularly in the context of a resource-limited developing country.
  Facial and spinal deformities, which are common in patients with achondroplasia,
  further complicated the anesthetic approach. CONCLUSIONS: The limited information
  on operative management of fractures in achondroplastic patients necessitated independent
  decision-making and diverging from the convenient approach where clear guidance
  is available in the literature."
