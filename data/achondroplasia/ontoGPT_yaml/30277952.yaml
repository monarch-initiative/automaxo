input_text: "Achondroplasia: Orocraniofacial Features and Orthodontic-Surgical Management
  Guidelines Proposal. In this study, the authors aimed to describe orocraniofacial
  features and to suggest orthodontic-surgical managements in achondroplasia, based
  on a literature review. The authors focused on skeletal and dentoalveolar malocclusion
  in order to highlight the place of orthognathic surgery, based on our experience
  of 3 patients. Maxillary hypoplasia in achondroplasia typically results in an Angle
  class III malocclusion with an anterior open bite. The other orocraniofacial features
  include enlarged calvarium, prominent forehead and frontal bossing, midface hypoplasia,
  elongated lower face and saddle-shaped nose due to lack of development of the nasomaxillary
  complex.All our patients had a typical facial appearance but each of them had their
  own particularities regarding medical history and severity of the dentoskeletal
  dysmorphosis. Two of them were successfully treated by orthognathic surgery; the
  other declined surgical treatment and underwent orthopedic treatment only (anchorage
  plates). The treatment failure of this 3rd patient raises the question of the efficiency
  of anchorage plates in achondroplasia. In the light of the literature and our results,
  the authors conclude the need for personalized management based on age, medical
  history, severity of the dentoskeletal dysmorphosis, functional and/or esthetic
  disorders, and the patient's needs and requests. In any patient, orthodontic management
  should be initiated at an early age, and orthognathic surgery modalities should
  be personalized and adapted to each situation."
