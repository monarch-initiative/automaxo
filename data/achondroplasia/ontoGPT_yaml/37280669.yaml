input_text: 'Achondroplasia natural history study (CLARITY): 60-year experience in
  orthopedic surgery from four skeletal dysplasia centers. BACKGROUND: The purpose
  of this study was to describe the frequency and risk factors for orthopedic surgery
  in patients with achondroplasia. CLARITY (The Achondroplasia Natural History Study)
  includes clinical data from achondroplasia patients receiving treatment at four
  skeletal dysplasia centers in the United States from 1957 to 2018. Data were entered
  and stored in a Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) database. RESULTS: Information
  from one thousand three hundred and seventy-four patients with achondroplasia were
  included in this study. Four hundred and eight (29.7%) patients had at least one
  orthopedic surgery during their lifetime and 299 (21.8%) patients underwent multiple
  procedures. 12.7% (n = 175) of patients underwent spine surgery at a mean age at
  first surgery of 22.4 +- 15.3 years old. The median age was 16.7 years old (0.1-67.4).
  21.2% (n = 291) of patients underwent lower extremity surgery at a mean age at first
  surgery of 9.9 +- 8.3 years old with a median age of 8.2 years (0.2-57.8). The most
  common spinal procedure was decompression (152 patients underwent 271 laminectomy
  procedures), while the most common lower extremity procedure was osteotomy (200
  patients underwent 434 procedures). Fifty-eight (4.2%) patients had both a spine
  and lower extremity surgery. Specific risk factors increasing the likelihood of
  orthopedic surgery included: patients with hydrocephalus requiring shunt placement
  having higher odds of undergoing spine surgery (OR 1.97, 95% CI 1.14-3.26); patients
  having a cervicomedullary decompression also had higher odds of undergoing spine
  surgery (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.30-2.63); and having lower extremity surgery increased
  the odds of spine surgery (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.45-2.90). CONCLUSIONS: Orthopedic surgery
  was a common occurrence in achondroplasia with 29.7% of patients undergoing at least
  one orthopedic procedure. Spine surgery (12.7%) was less common and occurred at
  a later age than lower extremity surgery (21.2%). Cervicomedullary decompression
  and hydrocephalus with shunt placement were associated with an increased risk for
  spine surgery. The results from CLARITY, the largest natural history study of achondroplasia,
  should aid clinicians in counseling patients and families about orthopedic surgery.'
