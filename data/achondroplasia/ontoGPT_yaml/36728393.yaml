input_text: 'Hydrotherapy for Patients With External Fixation: Effect on Infectious
  Events. BACKGROUND: Surgery to achieve long bone lengthening and deformity correction
  in skeletally immature patients is traditionally performed through external fixators.
  The incidence of infection during treatment is high. Hydrotherapy is highly beneficial
  during external fixation management, but the infection rates may impact its utilization.
  The objective of this paper is to document the incidence and duration of infection
  in patients who participated in a full hydrotherapy program when performed under
  medical supervision and in accordance with strict follow-up protocols. METHODS:
  In this retrospective study, we documented the key characteristics of patients who
  participated in hydrotherapy after lower limb external fixation surgery including
  age, sex, diagnosis and surgery site, the incidence and duration of pin site infections,
  and the percentage of cases, which were able to comply with a full hydrotherapy
  protocol. RESULTS: The hydrotherapy pool met all daily water quality metrics. Thirty-four
  children (19 males and 15 females) had a mean+-SD age of 10.9+-4.6 years. Of the
  cases, 80% were unilateral and 20% were bilateral. Diagnoses included congenital
  hereditary (eg, achondroplasia), congenital nonhereditary conditions (eg, fibular
  hemimelia), and acquired conditions (eg, traumatic). The location of osteotomy site
  was quite evenly spread between the femur and the tibia/fibula. Three out of the
  34 patients were unable to receive hydrotherapy due to continuous secretions; 2
  patients did not miss any sessions. The mean number of treatments was 3 per week.
  During the entire period, a total of 1200 treatments were performed for these patients
  with only 32 cancellations (about 3%) due to secretions or other signs of infection.
  Spearman correlation coefficients showed significantly high correlations between
  the duration of external fixation and the duration of hydrotherapy. There are no
  significant correlations between infections and other factors (sex, age segment,
  whether the problem is unilateral or /bilateral, diagnosis, and duration of treatment).
  CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report, to our knowledge, that documents the low
  prevalence of infectious events during hydrotherapy treatment and demonstrates its
  feasibility. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III; retrospective, comparative study.'
