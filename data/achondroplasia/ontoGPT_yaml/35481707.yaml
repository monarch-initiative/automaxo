input_text: 'Phase 1 safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics results
  of a long-acting C-type natriuretic peptide prodrug, TransCon CNP. AIM: TransCon
  CNP is a novel prodrug designed to provide sustained release of C-type natriuretic
  peptide (CNP) for once-weekly therapy, addressing the pathology leading to aberrant
  skeletal development in achondroplasia. This phase 1 trial was initiated to assess
  the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics (PD) and pharmacokinetics (PK) of TransCon
  CNP. METHODS: This randomized, placebo-controlled, single-ascending dose phase 1
  trial was performed at two sites in Australia and enrolled 45 healthy adult males.
  Subjects received placebo or TransCon CNP (single-ascending dose cohorts [3, 10,
  25, 75 or 150 mug CNP/kg]). The primary endpoint was frequency of adverse events
  and other safety outcomes. Other endpoints included PK and PD measured by cyclic
  guanosine-monophosphate (cGMP) and amino-terminal propeptide of CNP (NTproCNP).
  RESULTS: TransCon CNP provided continuous systemic exposure to CNP over at least
  7 days post-dose. Plasma and urine levels of cGMP were significantly increased in
  subjects administered TransCon CNP at 75-150 mug CNP/kg, indicating target engagement
  of active CNP at the natriuretic peptide receptor-B (NPR-B) for at least 1 week
  post-dose. TransCon CNP was well-tolerated, with no serious treatment-emergent adverse
  events or discontinuations. Extensive cardiac safety assessments did not reveal
  any clinically relevant effects on electrocardiogram parameters, including heart
  rate, PR, QRS and QTcF intervals. CONCLUSIONS: Safety and PD data from this phase
  1 trial support that TransCon CNP is well tolerated, with a PK profile compatible
  with a once-weekly dosing regimen. Further studies are ongoing to evaluate the potential
  of TransCon CNP to positively impact abnormal endochondral ossification in children
  with achondroplasia.'
