input_text: '[MATHEMATICAL MODELING OF OPTIONS FOR MOUNTING AN EXTERNAL FIXATION DEVICE
  ON THE TIBIA DURING ITS LENGTHENING]. The main problem in the treatment of axial
  deformities and limb shortening in pediatric orthopedics is the presence of incomplete
  growth of the patient, which gives an unfavorable basis for the achieved correction.
  The most advanced technology for the treatment of deformities and limb shortening
  is the use of external fixation devices (AVF). Target. To study the stress-strain
  state of the "tibia-AVF model with different variants of AVF mounting in conditions
  of tibia lengthening. Mathematical modeling of tibial osteosynthesis with external
  fixation devices in children with achondroplasia was carried out. The model of the
  distal end of the lower limb contained both lower leg bones and bony elements of
  the foot. Two variants of the AVF imposition were modeled: with the arrangement
  of all rods in the same plane, and according to the scheme with a V-shaped arrangement
  of the rods in the proximal tibia. The values of maximum stresses and values of
  relative deformations in the elements of the models were investigated. Sweat is
  a compressive load, the zone of maximum stress (66.8 MPa) in the bone tissue occurs
  around the upper rod. The smallest stresses (22.8 MPa) are observed around the fourth
  bar. On the second and third rods, the stresses are the same - 41.6 and 41.5 MPa,
  respectively. The V-shaped arrangement of the rods leads to a decrease in stresses
  around the first rod to 57.2 MPa. The stresses in the distal part of the proximal
  tibia fragment do not exceed 35.5 MPa. Under torsional loads in the model with parallel
  arrangement of rods, the zone of maximum stresses arises around the first rod (16.3
  MPa). The stresses in the distal fragment of the tibia are determined in the range
  from 1.2 to 3.9 MPa on the lower and upper rods, respectively. The use of an AVF
  with a V-shaped arrangement of the rods causes stresses in the tibia at a level
  of 13.1 MPa on the first rod, a minimum 1.1 MPa on the fourth. When the model is
  compressed with a parallel arrangement of the AVF rods, the values of relative deformations
  in the bone regenerate are determined in the range from 62 to 85%. The use of the
  AVF according to the scheme with a V-shaped arrangement of the rods makes it possible
  to reduce the magnitude of the relative deformations to the level of 77%. In the
  model with a parallel arrangement of the AVF rods, the relative deformations in
  the bone regenerate under torsional loads are determined in the range from 3.0 to
  6.0%. When using AVF with a V-shaped arrangement of rods, the level of relative
  deformations is determined in the range from 1.0 to 4.0%. The use of an AVF with
  a V-shaped arrangement of rods in the lower part of the proximal fragment of the
  tibia during its osteosynthesis allows reducing the level of stresses at all control
  points of the model for all types of loading, as compared to the model of an AVF
  with a parallel arrangement of rods. AVF with a V-shaped arrangement of the rods
  makes it possible to reduce the values of the relative deformations of the bone
  regenerate at all the studied control points of the models, both under compression
  and torsion loads.'
