input_text: "Bariatric Surgery in Patients with Achondroplasia, a Feasibility Study
  of Two Case Studies. BACKGROUND: Achondroplasia is a common skeletal dysplasia with
  a high prevalence of obesity in adulthood. Bariatric surgery has been shown to be
  effective in treating obesity and related comorbidities, but its feasibility and
  effectiveness in patients with achondroplasia have not been clearly established.
  OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness
  of bariatric surgery in patients with achondroplasia. SETTING: This study was performed
  in France, and bariatric surgeons from the Societe Francaise et Francophone de Chirurgie
  de l'Obesite et des Maladies Metaboliques (French Francophone Society of Surgery
  for Obesity or Metabolic Diseases) were asked to participate. METHODS: Two adult
  women with confirmed achondroplasia and a high BMI were selected for laparoscopic
  sleeve gastrectomy. Preoperative data were collected, including demographic information,
  comorbidities, and follow-up at 1, 3, and 6 months and 1 year after surgery. Complications
  were monitored and recorded. RESULTS: Both patients had good excess weight loss
  outcomes, with an average excess weight loss of 60.5% 1 year after surgery. One
  patient had a follow-up of 3 years and an excess weight loss of 44%. The surgery
  was well-tolerated, and no major complications were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Bariatric
  surgery is feasible and effective in patients with achondroplasia, with good outcomes
  for excess weight loss and related comorbidities. These findings suggest that bariatric
  surgery should be considered a treatment option for patients with achondroplasia
  and obesity."
