input_text: "Multilevel thoracic and lumbar ligamentum flavum ossification in an achondroplasic-a
  rare presentation. INTRODUCTION: Achondroplasia is a rare autosomal dominant condition
  characterized by stenosis in spinal canal. Multilevel Ossification of the ligamentum
  flavum in the spine is a rare occurrence which too can contribute to stenosed canal.
  CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of an Indian achondroplasic dwarf with multilevel
  ossification of ligamentum flavum (OLF) at thoracic and lumbar segment. She presented
  in the outpatient department with bilateral weakness in legs with complete foot
  drop on the left side and was non-ambulatory. She was managed surgically by instrumentation
  with multiple interbody fusions with wide decompression and excision of OLF. The
  patient responded well to the surgery and became a walker after 2-year follow-up.
  DISCUSSION: Achondroplasic patients may present rarely with multiregional and multilevel
  OLF. It is important to identify them preoperatively so as to have good surgical
  outcome. Wide laminectomy, removal of the ossified ligament, and fusion with instrumentation
  resulted in the improvement of the patient's neurological symptoms and functions."
