input_text: 'Once-daily, subcutaneous vosoritide therapy in children with achondroplasia:
  a randomised, double-blind, phase 3, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial. BACKGROUND:
  There are no effective therapies for achondroplasia. An open-label study suggested
  that vosoritide administration might increase growth velocity in children with achondroplasia.
  This phase 3 trial was designed to further assess these preliminary findings. METHODS:
  This randomised, double-blind, phase 3, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial compared
  once-daily subcutaneous administration of vosoritide with placebo in children with
  achondroplasia. The trial was done in hospitals at 24 sites in seven countries (Australia,
  Germany, Japan, Spain, Turkey, the USA, and the UK). Eligible patients had a clinical
  diagnosis of achondroplasia, were ambulatory, had participated for 6 months in a
  baseline growth study and were aged 5 to less than 18 years at enrolment. Randomisation
  was done by means of a voice or web-response system, stratified according to sex
  and Tanner stage. Participants, investigators, and trial sponsor were masked to
  group assignment. Participants received either vosoritide 15 0 mug/kg or placebo,
  as allocated, for the duration of the 52-week treatment period administered by daily
  subcutaneous injections in their homes by trained caregivers. The primary endpoint
  was change from baseline in mean annualised growth velocity at 52 weeks in treated
  patients as compared with controls. All randomly assigned patients were included
  in the efficacy analyses (n=121). All patients who received one dose of vosoritide
  or placebo (n=121) were included in the safety analyses. The trial is complete and
  is registered, with EudraCT, number, 2015-003836-11. FINDINGS: All participants
  were recruited from Dec 12, 2016, to Nov 7, 2018, with 60 assigned to receive vosoritide
  and 61 to receive placebo. Of 124 patients screened for eligibility, 121 patients
  were randomly assigned, and 119 patients completed the 52-week trial. The adjusted
  mean difference in annualised growth velocity between patients in the vosoritide
  group and placebo group was 1 57 cm/year in favour of vosoritide (95% CI [1 22-1
  93]; two-sided p<0 0001). A total of 119 patients had at least one adverse event;
  vosoritide group, 59 (98%), and placebo group, 60 (98%). None of the serious adverse
  events were considered to be treatment related and no deaths occurred. INTERPRETATION:
  Vosoritide is an effective treatment to increase growth in children with achondroplasia.
  It is not known whether final adult height will be increased, or what the harms
  of long-term therapy might be. FUNDING: BioMarin Pharmaceutical.'
