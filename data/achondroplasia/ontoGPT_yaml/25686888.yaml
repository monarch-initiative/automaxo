input_text: 'Surgical treatment for cervicomedullary compression among infants with
  achondroplasia. PURPOSE: Achondroplasia is the most common form of dwarfism. Respiratory
  failure is responsible for most deaths among these children and is often related
  to cervicomedullary compression (CMC). We present our experience with early cervicomedullary
  decompression in infants with achondroplasia. METHODS: Data was retrospectively
  collected for infants with achondroplasia who underwent CMC decompression between
  1998 and 2013. Data included presurgical and postsurgical neurological examinations,
  MRI scans, and sleep study results. RESULTS: Ten infants were included. Ages at
  surgery were 4 to 23 months (12.5 +- 6.88 months). All infants displayed neurological
  findings prior to surgery, although often subtle. All infants underwent a foramen
  magnum opening with a wide C1 laminectomy. Following surgery, seven patients (70
  %) demonstrated improved neurological status, and one displayed neurological deterioration.
  Seven patients demonstrated improved sleep quality 1 year after surgery. These patients
  had a good or improved neurological status following surgery. Preoperative radiological
  findings included abnormal hyperintense T2 changes in all children (improved following
  surgery in six children), brainstem distortion in four children (improved in all),
  and diminished cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) spaces at the level of the foramen magnum
  in eight children (improved in seven). One child with extensive preoperative T2
  changes accompanied by neurological and respiratory decline, deteriorated following
  surgery, and remains chronically ventilated. CONCLUSIONS: Infants with achondroplasia
  are prone to neurological and respiratory symptoms. We believe that early diagnosis
  and early surgery for decompression of the foramen magnum and C1 lamina can alleviate
  respiratory symptoms, improve neurological status, and perhaps prevent sudden infant
  death in this population.'
