input_text: 'Pharmacokinetics and Exposure-Response of Vosoritide in Children with
  Achondroplasia. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Vosoritide, an analog of C-type natriuretic
  peptide, has been developed for the treatment of children with achondroplasia. The
  pharmacokinetics of vosoritide and relationships between plasma exposure and efficacy,
  biomarkers, and safety endpoints were evaluated in a phase II, open-label, dose-escalation
  study (N = 35 patients aged 5-14 years who received daily subcutaneous injections
  for 24 months) and a phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (N = 60 patients
  aged 5-18 years randomized to receive daily subcutaneous injections for 52 weeks).
  METHODS: Pharmacokinetic parameters for both studies were obtained from non-compartmental
  analysis. Potential correlations between vosoritide exposure and changes in annualized
  growth velocity, collagen type X marker (CXM; a biomarker of endochondral ossification),
  cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP; a biomarker of pharmacological activity),
  heart rate, and systolic and diastolic blood pressures were then evaluated. RESULTS:
  The exposure-response relationships for changes in both annualized growth velocity
  and the CXM biomarker saturated at 15 mug/kg, while systemic pharmacological activity,
  as measured by urinary cGMP, was near maximal or saturated at exposures obtained
  at the highest dose studied (i.e. 30 mug/kg). This suggested that the additional
  bioactivity was likely in tissues not related to endochondral bone formation. In
  the phase III study, following subcutaneous administration at the recommended dose
  of 15 mug/kg to patients with achondroplasia aged 5-18 years, vosoritide was rapidly
  absorbed with a median time to maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) of 15 minutes,
  and cleared with a mean half-life of 27.9 minutes after 52 weeks of treatment. Vosoritide
  exposure (Cmax and area under the concentration-time curve [AUC]) was consistent
  across visits. No evidence of accumulation with once-daily dosing was observed.
  Total anti-vosoritide antibody (TAb) responses were detected in the serum of 25
  of 60 (42%) treated patients in the phase III study, with no apparent impact of
  TAb development noted on annualized growth velocity or vosoritide exposure. Across
  the exposure range obtained with 15 microg/kg in the phase III study, no meaningful
  correlations between vosoritide plasma exposure and changes in annualized growth
  velocity or CXM, or changes from predose heart rate, and systolic or diastolic blood
  pressures were observed. CONCLUSIONS: The results support the recommended dose of
  vosoritide 15 microg/kg for once-daily subcutaneous administration in patients with
  achondroplasia aged >= 5 years whose epiphyses are not closed. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION:
