input_text: 'Predictors of NIV-related adverse events in children using long-term
  noninvasive ventilation. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: An increasing number of children
  with diverse medical conditions are using long-term noninvasive ventilation (NIV).
  This study examined the impact of demographic, clinical, and technology-related
  factors on long-term NIV adverse events in a large cohort of children using long-term
  NIV. METHODS: This was a multicenter retrospective review of all children who initiated
  long-term NIV in the province of Alberta, Canada, from January 2005 to September
  2014, and followed until December 2015. Inclusion criteria were children who had
  used NIV for 3 months or more and had at least one follow-up visit with the NIV
  programs. RESULTS: We identified 507 children who initiated NIV at a median age
  of 7.5 (interquartile range: 8.6) years and 93% of them reported at least one NIV-related
  adverse event during the initial follow-up visit. Skin injury (20%) and unintentional
  air leaks (19%) were reported more frequently at the initial visit. Gastrointestinal
  symptoms, midface hypoplasia, increased drooling, aspiration and pneumothorax were
  rarely reported (<5%). Younger age and underlying conditions such as Down syndrome,
  achondroplasia, and Duchenne muscular dystrophy were early predictors of unintentional
  air leak. Younger age also predicted child sleep disruption in the short term and
  ongoing parental sleep disruption. Obesity was a risk factor for persistent nasal
  symptoms. Mask type was not a significant predictor for NIV-related short- or long-term
  complications. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that NIV-related complications
  are frequent. Appropriate mask-fitting and headgear adaptation, and a proactive
  approach to early detection may help to reduce adverse events.'
