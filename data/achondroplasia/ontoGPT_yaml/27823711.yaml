input_text: "Central sleep apnea in children: experience at a single center. OBJECTIVE:
  Central sleep apnea (CSA) syndromes are rare in children and data in children over
  one year of age are scarce. The aim of the study was to describe the sleep characteristics,
  underlying disorders, management, and outcome of children with CSA. PATIENTS/METHODS:
  A retrospective chart review of all children >1 year of age, diagnosed with CSA
  on a laboratory sleep study during a 20-month period, was performed. CSA was defined
  by a central apnea index (CAI) >5 events/h. The clinical management and the patient's
  outcome were analyzed. RESULTS: Eighteen of 441 (4.1%) patients recorded during
  the study period had CSA. The median CAI, pulse oximetry, and oxygen desaturation
  index were 13/h (range 6-146), 96% (93-98%), and 18/h (6-98), respectively. Neurosurgical
  pathologies represented the most common underlying disorders with Arnold-Chiari
  malformation in four and ganglioglioma in three patients. Other underlying disorders
  were Prader-Willi syndrome (N = 3), achondroplasia (N = 2), and Down syndrome, with
  one patient having an achondroplasia and a Down syndrome. The remaining six patients
  had other genetic diseases. The most common investigation was brain magnetic resonance
  imaging (MRI). Individualized management with neurosurgery and/or chemotherapy,
  continuous positive airway pressure (in two patients having associated obstructive
  events), or noninvasive ventilation resulted in an improvement in CSA and the clinical
  presentation in 11 patients. CONCLUSION: CSA is rare in children >1 year of age.
  Underlying disorders are dominated by neurosurgical disorders. Individualized management
  is able to improve CSA and the clinical condition in most patients."
