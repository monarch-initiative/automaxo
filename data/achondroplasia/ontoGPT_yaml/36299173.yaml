input_text: A 66-Year-Old Woman with Achondroplasia and Quadriparesis with an Ovarian
  Cyst Erroneously Diagnosed as Urinary Retention by an Automated Bladder Scan. BACKGROUND
  Automated bladder scanning has become a principal tool in the assessment and management
  of chronically debilitated patients residing in skilled nursing facilities, hospices,
  and acute inpatient settings. To a large extent, the bladder scan, generally performed
  by nursing staff, has replaced physical examination while addressing the differential
  diagnoses of anuria or voiding disturbances that require consideration of urinary
  catheterization. Health care providers can quickly master this easily performed
  technique, and currently, due to confidence in the bladder scan finding, physical
  examination with suprapubic palpation and percussion may be carelessly omitted.
  The case description presented here illustrates how not performing a physical examination
  can lead to misdiagnosis caused by misinterpretation of bladder scan findings. CASE
  REPORT A 66-year-old, quadriparetic, chronically ventilated female patient with
  achondroplasia underwent repeated hospital referrals and bladder catheterizations
  for presumed flaccid, neurogenic bladder with urinary retention. This postulated
  diagnosis was based on occasional reports of urinary catheter obstruction as well
  as on automated bladder scanning indicating a markedly distended bladder. However,
  the bladder could not be drained by insertion of urinary catheters. Eventually,
  a proper physical examination excluded the presence of suprapubic fullness compatible
  with distended bladder and contradicting bladder scan findings, prompting re-examining
  an overlooked evaluation of computed tomography that reported a huge ovarian cyst.
  The patient was found to have intact voiding capabilities and is now weaned from
  the catheter. CONCLUSIONS This case and the literature review underscore drawbacks
  in automated bladder scanning. This technique should be used as an adjunctive measure
  rather than a replacement for a physical examination in the evaluation of voiding
  disturbances, especially when there are discrepancies between bladder scan findings
  and the volume of urine drained by catheterization.
