input_text: Intraoperative airway obstruction related to tracheostomy tube malposition
  in a patient with achondroplasia and Jeune's syndrome. A 14 year-old adolescent
  with achondroplasia and Jeune's syndrome (asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy) presented
  for cervical spine surgery in the prone position. Due to the need for home mechanical
  ventilation at night, the patient had a tracheostomy in place. With the first surgical
  procedure, the cuffed tracheostomy tube was left in place during prone positioning.
  Difficulties encountered with ventilation through the cuffed tracheostomy tube in
  the prone position necessitated aborting the case. During three subsequent surgeries,
  the tracheostomy tube was removed and an armored endotracheal tube was placed through
  the tracheostomy stoma prior to prone positioning. No further difficulties with
  ventilation were noted with the subsequent cases. There are currently no guidelines
  in the medical literature regarding perioperative management of patients with a
  tracheostomy requiring prone positioning for surgery. The management of such patients
  is reviewed and possible problems with tracheostomy positioning during prone positioning
  are explored. Given such issues, we would suggest removal of the tracheostomy tube
  and placement of an armored endotracheal tube through the stoma during surgical
  procedures in the prone position.
