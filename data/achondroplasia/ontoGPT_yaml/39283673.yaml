input_text: 'Musculoskeletal Issues in Children and Adolescents: Genetic Musculoskeletal
  Disorders. Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked recessive genetic disorder
  with progressive proximal weakness as the principal sign. Glucocorticoids and physical
  therapy are the mainstay of treatment. Exercise intolerance is the hallmark of metabolic
  myopathies, which require a combination of laboratory testing, electrodiagnostic
  testing, and muscle biopsy for diagnosis. Joint hypermobility may be an isolated
  finding or be associated with hypermobility Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), other
  variants of EDS, or marfanoid syndromes. The latter conditions are associated with
  aortic and cardiac valvular abnormalities. Osteogenesis imperfecta encompasses a
  group of disorders characterized by bone fragility presenting with a low-impact
  fracture as a result of minimal trauma. Management includes multidiscipline specialists.
  Down syndrome (DS), or trisomy 21, is the most common chromosome abnormality identified
  in live births. Routine evaluation of atlantoaxial instability with x-ray is no
  longer recommended for children with DS without symptoms of atlantoaxial instability;
  however, clinical evaluation of symptoms is required for sports preparticipation.
  Achondroplasia is the most common skeletal dysplasia. Clinical signs are macrocephaly,
  short limb, short stature with disproportionately shorter humerus and femur, along
  with characteristic findings in pelvis and lumbar spine x-rays. Caregivers should
  be educated on proper positioning and handling to avoid complications, including
  car seat-related deaths.'
