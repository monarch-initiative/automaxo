input_text: 'Acute Implant-related Complications in Pediatric Cervical Spine Fusion.
  BACKGROUND: The use of modern rigid instrumentation in pediatric cervical fusions
  decreases the risk of implant-related complications, both acute and long term. However,
  previous studies have indicated that acute implant-related issues still occur in
  the adult population. Reports of pediatric acute implant complications, occurring
  within 3 months of surgery, are under-represented in the literature. The purpose
  of this study is to document the prevalence of acute implant-related complications
  in a pediatric cervical fusion population. METHODS: A retrospective review of instrumented
  cervical fusions from August 2002 to December 2018 was conducted. Acute implant-related
  complications were defined as malposition, fracture, or disengagement of cervical
  instrumentation, including screws, rods, and plates, within 90 days of surgery.
  RESULTS: A total of 166 cases were included (55% male individuals) with an average
  age at surgery of 12.5 years (SD, +-5.28). Acute implant-related complications occurred
  in 5 patients (3%). All 5 patients had a syndromic diagnosis: Loeys-Dietz (n=1),
  osteopetrosis (n=1), neurofibromatosis (n=1), trisomy 20 (n=1), and achondroplasia
  (n=1). One case involved asymptomatic screw protrusion, 1 case lateral mass screw
  pull-out, 2 more had screw-rod disengagement, and the last experienced dislodgement
  of the anterior plate. The median time until the presentation was 25 days (range,
  1 to 79 d). All patients (n=5) required surgical revision. CONCLUSIONS: This case
  series suggests that the overall incidence of acute cervical implant failure is
  low. However, failure is more likely to occur in patients with underlying syndromes
  compared with patients with different etiologies. Intraoperative use of 3-dimensional
  computed tomography imaging is recommended to evaluate the screw position and potentially
  avoid later surgery.'
