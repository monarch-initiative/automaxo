input_text: Health Supervision for People With Achondroplasia. Achondroplasia is the
  most common short-stature skeletal dysplasia, additionally marked by rhizomelia,
  macrocephaly, midface hypoplasia, and normal cognition. Potential medical complications
  associated with achondroplasia include lower extremity long bone bowing, middle-ear
  dysfunction, obstructive sleep apnea, and, more rarely, cervicomedullary compression,
  hydrocephalus, thoracolumbar kyphosis, and central sleep apnea. This is the second
  revision to the original 1995 health supervision guidance from the American Academy
  of Pediatrics for caring for patients with achondroplasia. Although many of the
  previously published recommendations remain appropriate for contemporary medical
  care, this document highlights interval advancements in the clinical methods available
  to monitor for complications associated with achondroplasia. This document is intended
  to provide guidance for health care providers to help identify individual patients
  at high risk of developing serious sequelae and to enable intervention before complications
  develop.
