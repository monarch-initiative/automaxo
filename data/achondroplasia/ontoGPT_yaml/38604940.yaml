input_text: "Exploring the family experience of children aged 2-4 years receiving
  daily vosoritide injections: A qualitative study. PURPOSE: Vosoritide is administered
  as a daily subcutaneous injection in children with achondroplasia. In clinical trials,
  families of children aged 2-4 years reported difficulty with drug administration
  due to child fear, pain, and distress. Study aims were to gain a better understanding
  of the current vosoritide administration experience in this cohort and to investigate
  whether topical anaesthesia and ice application prior to injections improved the
  child and family experience. DESIGN AND METHODS: A qualitative descriptive study
  design ensured in-depth understanding of family experience. Parents were interviewed
  to explore experience of vosoritide administration for their child at two time points,
  before (Phase 1) and after (Phase 2) the introduction of topical anaesthesia and
  ice application prior to injections. Interviews were analysed using thematic analysis.
  RESULTS: Seven families participated. Children's ages ranged from 2 years 2 months
  to 3 years 11 months. Five themes emerged from data analysis: (1) The reality of
  the burden of care; (2) Child experience as the greatest obstacle; (3) Parents juggle
  multiple emotional considerations; (4) Many factors may impact experience; and (5)
  Short-term and long-term impacts. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of vosoritide in this
  cohort presents multiple challenges for families. Factors which influenced experience
  differed between families. Responses to topical anaesthesia and ice application
  also varied between children, improving administration experience for some children
  and worsening experience for others. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: This study highlights
  the need for individualised care for young children receiving daily injections.
  Support should be provided to families to identify factors that improve experience."
