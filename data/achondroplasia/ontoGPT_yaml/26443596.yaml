input_text: 'Advances in treatment of achondroplasia and osteoarthritis. Achondroplasia
  (ACH) is the prototype and most common of the human chondrodysplasias. It results
  from gain-of-function mutations that exaggerate the signal output of the fibroblast
  growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3), a receptor tyrosine kinase that negatively regulates
  growth plate activity and linear bone growth. Several approaches to reduce FGFR3
  signaling by blocking receptor activation or inhibiting downstream signals have
  been proposed. Five show promise in preclinical mouse studies. Two candidate therapies
  target the extracellular domain of FGFR3. The first is a decoy receptor that competes
  for activating ligands. The second is a synthetic blocking peptide that prevents
  ligands from binding and activating FGFR3. Two established drugs, statins and meclozine,
  improve growth of ACH mice. The strongest candidate therapy employs an analog of
  C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), which antagonizes the mitogen-activated-protein
  (MAP) kinase pathway downstream of the FGFR3 receptor and may also act independently
  in the growth plate. Only the CNP analog has reached clinical trials. Preliminary
  results of Phase 2 studies show a substantial increase in growth rate of ACH children
  after six months of therapy with no serious adverse effects. A challenge for drug
  therapy in ACH is targeting agents to the avascular growth plate. The application
  of gene therapy in osteoarthritis offers insights because it faces similar technical
  obstacles. Major advances in gene therapy include the emergence of recombinant adeno-associated
  virus as the vector of choice, capsid engineering to target vectors to specific
  tissues, and development of methods to direct vectors to articular chondrocytes. '
