input_text: 'Upper Limb Lengthening in Achondroplasia Using Unilateral External Fixation.
  PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to analyze the long-term results of humeral
  lengthening in achondroplastic patients and make suggestions on the most appropriate
  surgical technique to improve patient outcomes. METHODS: Fifty-four humeral lengthening
  procedures performed in 27 achondroplastic patients were reviewed. Elongations were
  performed by means of callotasis with unilateral external fixation. Inclusion criteria
  were: achondroplastic patients under 17 years without prior arm operations and minimum
  follow-up of 36 months. RESULTS: Fifty humeri in 25 patients (13 men and 12 women),
  aged between 9 and 17 years, met the inclusion criteria. Mean humeral lengthening
  was 8.82 cm (range: 5 to 10.5 cm), which represented an elongation of 54.80% (range:
  46% to 63%) of the original length. The healing index was 0.91 months (range: 0.72
  to 1.4 mo) per centimeter gained. Shoulder and elbow range of motion and stability
  were preserved in 47 limbs. Noncomplicated cases consistently experienced a significant
  functional improvement in the performance of activities of daily living such as
  putting on footwear and personal hygiene. Short-term complications included 11 pin-tract
  infections, 1 radial nerve neuropraxia, and 1 failure of the regenerated bone formation.
  None of these complications prevented from completion of treatment. Long-term complications
  included 2 cases of nonunion, 3 elbow flexion contractures, and 2 cases of psychological
  dissatisfaction, all of them in 4 patients. Factors associated with long-term complications
  were intraoperative fragment displacement and distal humeral osteotomy. No fractures
  of the regenerated bone were identified in the long term. CONCLUSIONS: Callotasis
  with unilateral external fixation is a reliable and well-tolerated procedure for
  humeral lengthening in achondroplastic patients, with an acceptable complication
  rate. Guided fixator placement and a proximal humeral osteotomy are strongly recommended
  technical tips as they may help prevent complications and improve outcomes. LEVEL
  OF EVIDENCE: Level IV-case series.'
