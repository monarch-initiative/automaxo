input_text: Long-term follow-up of a patient with achondroplasia treated with an orthodontic
  approach. We successfully treated a patient with achondroplasia with conventional
  orthodontic techniques. It was followed by long-term retention. The patient, a 12-year-old
  boy, had chief complaints of occlusal disturbance and mandibular protrusion. He
  had been diagnosed with achondroplasia and had growth hormone treatment in his early
  teenage years. His facial profile was concave with a bulging forehead and a retrognathic
  maxilla. It was characterized by a skeletal Class III jaw-base relationship with
  a retropositioned maxilla. At the age of 12 years 9 months, maxillary protraction
  was initiated with a reverse headgear; for 2 years 6 months, the maxillomandibular
  growth was controlled. After the growth spurt, at the age of 15 years 6 months,
  leveling and alignment of both dental arches were started with preadjusted edgewise
  appliances. After 83 months of multibracket treatment, an acceptable occlusion with
  a Class I molar relationship and an adequate interincisal relationship was achieved,
  despite the simultaneous marked vertical growth of the mandible. The resultant occlusion
  was stable during a 6-year retention period, although considerable forward-downward
  mandibular growth was observed. Conclusively, our results indicated the necessity
  of long-term observation in this patient with achondroplasia, especially because
  of the persistent mandibular growth.
