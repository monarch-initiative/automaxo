input_text: 'Role of proximal tibiofibular fixation in leg lengthening with the Ilizarov
  method in the achondroplastic patient. The role of proximal tibiofibular joint (TFJ)
  transfixion during Ilizarov tibial lengthening is still debated in the literature.
  The aim of this study was to show that TFJ transfixion can be avoided with no impact
  on patient outcome. All achondroplastic patients undergoing tibia lengthening from
  1999 to 2018 were included. Patients were divided in two groups: group A (11 patients)
  submitted to proximal TFJ transfixion and group B (22 patients) not submitted to
  TFJ transfixion. The results showed a statistically significant difference in proximal
  fibular migration (PFM) between the two groups of patients, with a mean PFM of 9.2
  mm (range, 1-20 mm) and of 21 mm (range, 2.7-76 mm) in group A and in group B, respectively.
  We can state that PFM up to 41 mm in our series did not affect joint function and
  stability. There are no statistically significant differences in the other radiological
  parameters. Analysis of functional scores (Knee Society, Tegner-Lhysolm, Association
  for the Study and Application of Methods of Ilizarov) did not reveal significant
  differences between the groups. The scores of the Achondroplasia Personal Life Experience
  Scale were also similar in the two groups, demonstrating a good quality of life.
  There are no differences between the two groups in terms of clinical-functional
  outcome of the knee, radiographic results, and quality of life. Transfixion of proximal
  TFJ may not be necessary, but it is important to avoid premature consolidation of
  the fibular osteotomy.'
