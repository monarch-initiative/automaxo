input_text: 'A case of successful coronary angioplasty in an achondroplasia patient
  with total occlusion of an anomalous right coronary artery (case report). BACKGROUND:
  Coronary interventions in patients of achondroplasia have been reported rarely in
  the medical literature. Due to short stature and kyphoscoliosis, endovascular access
  (Cannulation) of the coronary arteries is usually extremely difficult in such patients.
  CASE PRESENTATION: A 33 years old patient, a known case of achondroplasia, presented
  with epigastric pain for 3 h duration to a university hospital, Sudan. Her height
  was 95 cm and her weight was 38 Kg. A trans-femoral approach for coronary angioplasty
  was preferred. After it has been extremely difficult to cannulate the left system
  at first, the cannulation has been performed successfully using 5F, JL3.5 catheter.
  The angiogram depicted total occlusion of the proximal right coronary artery which
  was found to be originating from the left coronary sinus of the aorta. Successful
  trans-femoral coronary angioplasty has been performed with stent placement, and
  no complications encountered. During her last follow up, 1 year after the procedure,
  she appeared to be free of symptoms and with no further ischemic attacks or procedure-related
  complications. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported
  case of successful coronary angioplasty in achondroplasia patient in whom the occluded
  artery is an anomalous coronary artery. Literature review, description of the achondroplasia,
  development of the coronary arteries and the hypothesized theory for the anomaly
  have been described in this case report. The PCI performed has also been clearly
  and comprehensively described.'
