input_text: 'Evaluation of simultaneous bilateral femoral distraction osteogenesis
  with antegrade intramedullary lengthening nails in achondroplasia with rhizomelic
  short stature: a retrospective study of 15 patients with a minimum follow-up of
  2 years. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Bilateral femoral distraction osteogenesis in patients
  with achondroplasia is insufficiently reported. We aimed to perform the first study
  that exclusively analyzed simultaneous bilateral femoral distraction osteogenesis
  with motorized intramedullary lengthening nails via an antegrade approach in patients
  with achondroplasia focused on reliability, accuracy, precision, and the evolving
  complications. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this retrospective singlecenter study we
  analyzed patients with achondroplasia who underwent simultaneous bilateral femoral
  lengthening with antegrade intramedullary lengthening nails between October 2014
  and April 2019. 15 patients (30 femoral segments) of median age 14 years (interquartile
  range [IQR] 12-15) were available for analysis. The median follow-up was 29 months
  (IQR 27-37) after nail implantation. RESULTS: The median distraction length per
  segment was 49 mm (IQR 47-51) with a median distraction index of 1.0 mm/day (IQR
  0.9-1.0), and a median consolidation index of 20 days/cm (IQR 17-23). Reliability
  of the lengthening nails was 97% and their calculated accuracy and precision were
  96% and 95%, respectively. The most common complication was temporary restriction
  of knee range of motion during distraction in 10 of 30 of the lengthened segments.
  1 patient was treated with 2 unplanned additional surgeries due to premature consolidation.
  CONCLUSION: The method is reliable and accurate with few complications.'
