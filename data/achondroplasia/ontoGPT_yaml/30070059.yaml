input_text: 'Outpatient initiation of long-term continuous positive airway pressure
  in children. INTRODUCTION: Current guidelines recommend initiating continuous positive
  airway pressure (CPAP) in children during an overnight in-hospital titration study.
  Due to a shortage of hospital beds and economic constraints, we started a program
  for outpatient initiation of CPAP in selected children with obstructive sleep apnea
  (OSA). METHODS: Objective CPAP compliance and efficacy were evaluated in consecutive
  children enrolled in an outpatient CPAP program when they fulfilled the following
  criteria: persistent OSA, age >6 months, stable condition, family living in the
  Parisian area and agreeing with a regular follow-up. RESULTS: Thirty-one children,
  median (range) age 8.9 years (0.8-17.5), were included in the program. The most
  common diagnosis were Down syndrome (n = 7), achondroplasia (n = 3), and obesity
  (n = 3). Median baseline obstructive apnea-hypopnea index (OAHI) was 12.5 events/h
  (5-100). Median duration of follow-up was 12.3 months (2.2-25.2). Four subjects
  (three adolescents with Down syndrome) were not compliant at 2-month follow-up with
  a compliance <4 h/night. In the other 27 subjects, median compliance was 08:21 h:min/night
  (05:45-12:20), with a median number of night use per month of 25 (18-30). CPAP efficacy
  at the end of follow-up was excellent in the compliant subjects with a median AHI
  of two events/h (0-4) and normal gas exchange with CPAP therapy. Three subjects
  were successfully weaned from CPAP treatment during the study period. CONCLUSION:
  Initiating CPAP in an outpatient setting in children is feasible and effective in
  selected subjects. A high rate of compliance can be achieved as well as a correction
  of OSA.'
