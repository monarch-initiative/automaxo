input_text: 'C-Type Natriuretic Peptide Analogue Therapy in Children with Achondroplasia.
  BACKGROUND: Achondroplasia is a genetic disorder that inhibits endochondral ossification,
  resulting in disproportionate short stature and clinically significant medical complications.
  Vosoritide is a biologic analogue of C-type natriuretic peptide, a potent stimulator
  of endochondral ossification. METHODS: In a multinational, phase 2, dose-finding
  study and extension study, we evaluated the safety and side-effect profile of vosoritide
  in children (5 to 14 years of age) with achondroplasia. A total of 35 children were
  enrolled in four sequential cohorts to receive vosoritide at a once-daily subcutaneous
  dose of 2.5 mug per kilogram of body weight (8 patients in cohort 1), 7.5 mug per
  kilogram (8 patients in cohort 2), 15.0 mug per kilogram (10 patients in cohort
  3), or 30.0 mug per kilogram (9 patients in cohort 4). After 6 months, the dose
  in cohort 1 was increased to 7.5 mug per kilogram and then to 15.0 mug per kilogram,
  and in cohort 2, the dose was increased to 15.0 mug per kilogram; the patients in
  cohorts 3 and 4 continued to receive their initial doses. At the time of data cutoff,
  the 24-month dose-finding study had been completed, and 30 patients had been enrolled
  in an ongoing long-term extension study; the median duration of follow-up across
  both studies was 42 months. RESULTS: During the treatment periods in the dose-finding
  and extension studies, adverse events occurred in 35 of 35 patients (100%), and
  serious adverse events occurred in 4 of 35 patients (11%). Therapy was discontinued
  in 6 patients (in 1 because of an adverse event). During the first 6 months of treatment,
  a dose-dependent increase in the annualized growth velocity was observed with vosoritide
  up to a dose of 15.0 mug per kilogram, and a sustained increase in the annualized
  growth velocity was observed at doses of 15.0 and 30.0 mug per kilogram for up to
  42 months. CONCLUSIONS: In children with achondroplasia, once-daily subcutaneous
  administration of vosoritide was associated with a side-effect profile that appeared
  generally mild. Treatment resulted in a sustained increase in the annualized growth
  velocity for up to 42 months. (Funded by BioMarin Pharmaceutical; ClinicalTrials.gov
