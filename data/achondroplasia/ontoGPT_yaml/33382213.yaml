input_text: 'Physical fitness and activity level in Norwegian adults with achondroplasia.
  This cross-sectional Physical Fitness Study compared cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2
  peak), six-minute walk test (6MWT), muscle strength (30sSTS), balance (BESS), and
  self-reported physical activity level (IPAQ) in Norwegian adults with achondroplasia
  (ACH) to reference values of average-statured individuals. The feasibility of the
  physical fitness tests and IPAQ was explored. Forty-three adults (22 women) participated.
  Mean age was 38 years (range 16-69 years). Mean differences (95% CI) for men and
  women with ACH compared to reference values were: VO2 peak. -7.0 m/min/kg (-13.6
  to -0.5, p = .037), and - 7.9 ml/kg/min (-11.6 to -4.3, p < .001); 6MWT -270.8 m
  (-340.4 to -201.2, p < .001), and - 196.7 m (-244.3 to -149.0, p = .001); 30sSTS
  -4.6 repetitions (-7.8 to -1.5, p = .006), and - 1.1 repetitions (-3.4 to 1.1, p
  = .335). There were no differences within ACH participants, except for VO2 peak,
  where men performed better. Sufficient physical activity (> 600 metabolic equivalent
  of task weekly) was achieved by 79% of the participants. The feasibility of the
  6MWT and 30sSTS was good. There was a strong correlation between the VO2 peak and
  6MWT (men: r = 0.63, p = .007; women: r = 0.71, p < .001). The findings indicate
  that the 6MWT and 30sSTS test are useful in assessing functional exercise capacity
  and muscle strength in adults with ACH.'
