input_text: 'The Utrecht approach to exercise in chronic childhood conditions: the
  decade in review. PURPOSE: To summarize and discuss current evidence and understanding
  of clinical pediatric exercise physiology focusing on the work the research group
  at Utrecht and others have performed in the last decade in a variety of chronic
  childhood conditions as a continuation of the legacy of Dr Bar-Or. KEY POINTS: The
  report discusses current research findings on the cardiopulmonary exercise performance
  of children (and adolescents) with juvenile idiopathic arthritis, osteogenesis imperfecta,
  achondroplasia, hemophilia, cerebral palsy, spina bifida, cystic fibrosis, and childhood
  cancer. Exercise recommendations and contraindications are provided for each condition.
  Implications for clinical practice and future research in this area are discussed
  for each of the chronic conditions presented. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The authors
  provide a basic framework for developing an individual and/or disease-specific training
  program, introduce the physical activity pyramid, and recommend a core set of clinical
  measures to be used in clinical research.'
