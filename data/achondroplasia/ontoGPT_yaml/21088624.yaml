input_text: 'Achondroplasia in female twins: surgical indications. Although in literature
  achondroplasia has been described profusely, reports on achondroplastic twins are
  limited. We present two cases of monozygotic female twins with achondroplasia, who
  underwent limb-lengthening surgical procedure with external fixation in the following
  five steps: tibia, femur, tibia; femur, homer. Both the cases presented a good limb
  length and an optimal correction of associated deformities after the treatment,
  fulfilling the indications. Surgical indications were mostly led by the axial deviations
  of the lower limbs, and the timing of the limb-lengthening procedures has been the
  same in both couples showing the importance of this aspect.'
