input_text: 'Humeral lengthening by distraction osteogenesis: a safe procedure? This
  study was conducted to assess the safety of humeral lengthening using an Ilizarov
  frame. We retrospectively reviewed 26 humeral segments in 17 patients that were
  lengthened at our department between 1993 and 2011. There were varying aetiologies
  including achondroplasia, epiphyseal dysplasia, Oilier disease, trauma or infection
  of the proximal humeral growth-plate, unicameral bone cyst and brachial plexus injury.
  Mean age at start of surgery was 17.05 years (range : 5-40). The mean lengthening
  achieved was 8.85 (3-13) cm. Mean lengthening percentage was 353% (range : 10-48).
  Average healing index was 30.56 days/cm (range : 17.46-4232). There was a significant
  difference in healing index between achondroplasia patients (28.79 days/cm) compared
  to others (33.41 days/cm). Minor problems included pin tract infection (14 segments).
  More important obstacles were temporary elbow flexion contracture (7 segments),
  premature consolidation (6 segments), radial nerve dysaesthesia (6 segments) and
  loosening of a Schanz screw (1 segment). Complications included one fracture and
  one progressive bowing after frame removal. One planned lengthening was not completely
  achieved. Despite a lot of obstacles, humeral lengthening using an Ilizarov frame
  provided a reliable method to treat the functional or cosmetic problems of upper
  limb shortening.'
