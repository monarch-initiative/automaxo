                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Achondroplasia typically results in compressive spinal canal stenosis in one-third of children, but rare under the age of 15 years. Laminectomy is the mainstay of treatment but this leads to instability and progressive deformity requiring complex fixation. In order to reduce that risk, we developed a novel modified augmented laminoplasty that increases spinal canal diameter while preserving the posterior column stability. METHODS: All laminoplasty cases for spinal compressive achondroplasia from 2006 to 2020 were included. Ten augmentation laminoplasty procedures were performed in 7 children with regular clinical and radiological post-operative follow-up. Kyphotic deformity and clinical outcomes (neurological and urological) were evaluated. RESULTS: At presentation, clinical features included radiculopathy, neurogenic claudication or acute cauda equina compression with sphincter dysfunction. The average age at initial surgery was 11.2 (range 5-16) with a mean follow-up of 5 (range 2-8) years. All patients demonstrated improvement in neurogenic claudication symptoms after surgery; however, bladder dysfunction persisted in some children. In one child, cervical and lumbar augmentation laminoplasties were performed for concomitant disease. Augmentation laminoplasty effectively prevented deformity progression over time in all cases except one where a further revision laminoplasty with extension was required for screw loosening. Despite this, progressive symptomatic kyphotic deformity led to a 360  fixation. Minor complications included one dural breach (repaired intraoperatively) and one superficial wound infection. CONCLUSION: Augmentation laminoplasty is a viable surgical option following laminectomy in achondroplasia patients as an alternative to surgical fixation. Fixation can be reserved for cases where there is progressive deformity and kyphosis.",

                    "abstract": "Achondroplasia is a lifelong condition requiring lifelong management. There is consensus that infants and children with achondroplasia should be managed by a multidisciplinary team experienced in the condition. However, many people are lost to follow-up after the transition from paediatric to adult care, and there is no standardised approach for management in adults, despite the recent availability of international consensus guidelines. To address this, the European Achondroplasia Forum has developed a patient-held checklist to support adults with achondroplasia in managing their health. The checklist highlights key symptoms of spinal stenosis and obstructive sleep apnoea, both among the most frequent and potentially severe medical complications in adults with achondroplasia. The checklist acts as a framework to support individuals and their primary care provider in completing a routine review. General advice on issues such as blood pressure, pain, hearing, weight, adaptive aids, and psychosocial aspects are also included. The checklist provides key symptoms to be aware of, in addition to action points so that people can approach their primary care provider and be directed to the appropriate specialist, if needed. Additionally, the European Achondroplasia Forum offers some ideas on implementing the checklist during the transition from paediatric to adult care, thus ensuring the existing multidisciplinary team model in place during childhood can support in engaging individuals and empowering them to take responsibility for their own care as they move into adulthood.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Vosoritide is administered as a daily subcutaneous injection in children with achondroplasia. In clinical trials, families of children aged 2-4 years reported difficulty with drug administration due to child fear, pain, and distress. Study aims were to gain a better understanding of the current vosoritide administration experience in this cohort and to investigate whether topical anaesthesia and ice application prior to injections improved the child and family experience. DESIGN AND METHODS: A qualitative descriptive study design ensured in-depth understanding of family experience. Parents were interviewed to explore experience of vosoritide administration for their child at two time points, before (Phase 1) and after (Phase 2) the introduction of topical anaesthesia and ice application prior to injections. Interviews were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Seven families participated. Children's ages ranged from 2 years 2 months to 3 years 11 months. Five themes emerged from data analysis: (1) The reality of the burden of care; (2) Child experience as the greatest obstacle; (3) Parents juggle multiple emotional considerations; (4) Many factors may impact experience; and (5) Short-term and long-term impacts. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of vosoritide in this cohort presents multiple challenges for families. Factors which influenced experience differed between families. Responses to topical anaesthesia and ice application also varied between children, improving administration experience for some children and worsening experience for others. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: This study highlights the need for individualised care for young children receiving daily injections. Support should be provided to families to identify factors that improve experience.",

                    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Vosoritide is the first precision medical therapy approved to increase growth velocity in children with achondroplasia. Sharing early prescribing experiences across different regions could provide a framework for developing practical guidance for the real-world use of vosoritide. METHODS: Two meetings were held to gather insight and early experience from experts in Europe, the Middle East, and the USA. The group comprised geneticists, pediatric endocrinologists, pediatricians, and orthopedic surgeons. Current practices and considerations for vosoritide were discussed, including administration practicalities, assessments, and how to manage expectations. RESULTS: A crucial step in the management of achondroplasia is to determine if adequate multidisciplinary support is in place. Training for families is essential, including practical information on administration of vosoritide, and how to recognize and manage injection-site reactions. Advocated techniques include establishing a routine, empowering patients by allowing them to choose injection sites, and managing pain. Patients may discontinue vosoritide if they cannot tolerate daily injections or are invited to participate in a clinical trial. Clinicians in Europe and the Middle East emphasized the importance of assessing adherence to daily injections, as non-adherence may impact response and reimbursement. Protocols for monitoring patients receiving vosoritide may be influenced by regional differences in reimbursement and healthcare systems. Core assessments may include pubertal staging, anthropometry, radiography to confirm open physes, the review of adverse events, and discussion of concomitant or new medications-but timing of these assessments may also differ regionally and vary across institutions. Patients and families should be informed that response to vosoritide can vary in both magnitude and timing. Keeping families informed regarding vosoritide clinical trial data is encouraged. CONCLUSION: The early real-world experience with vosoritide is generally positive. Sharing these insights is important to increase understanding of the practicalities of treatment with vosoritide in the clinical setting.",

An open-label study suggested that vosoritide administration might increase growth velocity in children with achondroplasia. This phase 3 trial was designed to further assess these preliminary findings. METHODS: This randomised, double-blind, phase 3, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial compared once-daily subcutaneous administration of vosoritide with placebo in children with achondroplasia. The trial was done in hospitals at 24 sites in seven countries (Australia, Germany, Japan, Spain, Turkey, the USA, and the UK). Eligible patients had a clinical diagnosis of achondroplasia, were ambulatory, had participated for 6 months in a baseline growth study and were aged 5 to less than 18 years at enrolment. Randomisation was done by means of a voice or web-response system, stratified according to sex and Tanner stage. Participants, investigators, and trial sponsor were masked to group assignment. Participants received either vosoritide 15 0 mug/kg or placebo, as allocated, for the duration of the 52-week treatment period administered by daily subcutaneous injections in their homes by trained caregivers. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in mean annualised growth velocity at 52 weeks in treated patients as compared with controls. All randomly assigned patients were included in the efficacy analyses (n=121). All patients who received one dose of vosoritide or placebo (n=121) were included in the safety analyses. The trial is complete and is registered, with EudraCT, number, 2015-003836-11. FINDINGS: All participants were recruited from Dec 12, 2016, to Nov 7, 2018, with 60 assigned to receive vosoritide and 61 to receive placebo. Of 124 patients screened for eligibility, 121 patients were randomly assigned, and 119 patients completed the 52-week trial. The adjusted mean difference in annualised growth velocity between patients in the vosoritide group and placebo group was 1 57 cm/year in favour of vosoritide (95% CI [1 22-1 93]; two-sided p<0 0001). A total of 119 patients had at least one adverse event; vosoritide group, 59 (98%), and placebo group, 60 (98%). None of the serious adverse events were considered to be treatment related and no deaths occurred. INTERPRETATION: Vosoritide is an effective treatment to increase growth in children with achondroplasia. It is not known whether final adult height will be increased, or what the harms of long-term therapy might be. FUNDING: BioMarin Pharmaceutical.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Antegrade intramedullary (IM) nailing for skeletally immature femur fractures can damage the capital femoral epiphysis blood supply, leading to avascular necrosis (AVN) of the femoral head. Reported AVN rates are 2% for piriformis entry and 1.4% for trochanteric entry. None of previous reports described IM lengthening nails for limb lengthening procedures. We have used self-lengthening telescopic nails with a proximal Herzog bend and standard trochanteric entry for femoral lengthening in children. The purpose of this study is to determine whether trochanteric entry IM lengthening nails can be used safely (no AVN or proximal femoral deformity) in the skeletally immature femur. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed between 2004 and 2014 to determine all skeletally immature patients younger than 18 years of age who had a reamed IM lengthening nail inserted through the greater trochanter, with at least 1-year follow-up. RESULTS: Thirty-one femurs were lengthened in 28 patients (17 males and 11 females). The etiology was congenital femoral deficiency (10), achondroplasia (6), post-traumatic (5), hemihypertrophy (3), Ollier disease (2), and miscellaneous (5). An attending surgeon was present for all procedures. Mean age at time of surgery was 12.9 years (range, 7 to 17 y). Mean follow-up was 3.5 years (range, 1.4 to 9 y). The average amount of lengthening was 5.4 cm (range, 3 to 6.7 cm). Twenty-four nails were 10.7 mm in diameter. Seven nails were 12.5 mm in diameter. Intramedullary skeletal kinetic distractor was used in 18 femurs and PRECICE in 13 femurs. Ten segments (7 intramedullary skeletal kinetic distractor; 3 PRECICE) experienced 13 complications. None of the patients developed AVN or proximal femoral deformity. CONCLUSIONS: IM lengthening nails inserted through the greater trochanter may be utilized in skeletally immature patients without increased risk of AVN of the femoral head or proximal femoral deformity. Larger trials would be helpful to confirm our hypothesis. We recommend careful surgical technique with liberal use of the image intensifier to avoid trauma to the femoral head blood supply.

                    "abstract": "STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the trends in management and inpatient outcomes in patients with syndromic scoliosis undergoing spinal deformity correction. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Syndromic scoliosis (SS) refers to scoliosis that is most commonly associated with systemic disease including Ehler Danhlos syndrome (EDS), Marfan syndrome (MF), Down syndrome (DS), Achondroplasia (AP), and Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). Limited data exist evaluating hospital outcomes in patients with SS undergoing spinal deformity correction. METHODS: The Kids' Inpatient Database (KIDS) was queried from 2001 to 2012 to identify all pediatric patients with scoliosis undergoing spinal fusion. These patients were then sub-divided into two cohorts: (1) patients with idiopathic scoliosis (IS) and (2) patients with syndromic scoliosis. Trends in surgical management, and postoperative morbidity and mortality were assessed. Length of stay and total hospital charges were additionally analyzed. A sub-analysis to characterize outcomes in each syndrome was also performed. RESULTS: An estimated 1071 patients with SS were identified and compared with 24,989 pediatric patients with IS. MF (36.8%), Down syndrome (16.0%), and PWS (14.9%) were the most common diagnoses among patients with SS. Between 2001 and 2012, there was a significant decline in the number of anterior procedures performed in both cohorts. Conversely, the number of posterior based procedures increased. SS was associated with increased major complications (2.7% compared with 1.0% in IS; P < 0.001) and minor complication rates (41.0% compared with 28.5% in IS; P < 0.001). Patients with AP incurred the highest rate of major complications (10.7%), minor complications (60.8%), and intraoperative durotomies (6.1%). Total hospital charges increased significantly over the 12-year span. CONCLUSION: Trends in management of syndromic scoliosis have paralleled that of idiopathic scoliosis. Syndromic scoliosis is associated with increased risks with surgical deformity correction. Further prospective studies are warranted to evaluate the reasons for these differences.

It is characterized by bone growth abnormalities that are well characterized and by a strong predisposition to abdominal obesity for which causes are unknown. Despite having aroused interest at the end of the 20 h century, there are still only very little data available on this aspect of the pathology. Today, interest is rising again, and some studies are now proposing mechanistic hypotheses and guidance for patient management. These data confirm that obesity is a major health problem in achondroplasia necessitating an early yet complex clinical management. Anticipatory care should be directed at identifying children who are at high risk to develop obesity and intervening to prevent the metabolic complications in adults. In this review, we are regrouping available data characterizing obesity in achondroplasia and we are identifying the current tools used to monitor obesity in these patients.",

The pan-FGFR inhibitor erdafitinib was approved for the treatment of mUC with FGFR3 alterations but is limited due to FGFR isoform off-target toxicities and the development of on-target gatekeeper resistance mutations. TYRA-300 (22) was conceived using a structure-based approach as a potent FGFR3-selective inhibitor to avoid the toxicities associated with inhibition of FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR4, and to be agnostic for the FGFR3 gatekeeper mutations.

This perspective presents the mechanism of action, benefit, and potential mechanistic limitation of the drugs currently being evaluated in clinical trials for achondroplasia. This article also discusses the potential impact of those drugs not only in increasing the growth of individuals living with achondroplasia but also in improving their quality of life.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Many patients with achondroplasia experience functional impairments because of rhizomelic upper extremities (proximal limb shortening). Bilateral humeral lengthening may overcome these functional limitations, but it is associated with several risks, such as radial nerve palsy and insufficient bone regeneration. Only a few studies have reported on patient satisfaction and functional outcome after humeral lengthening in patients with achondroplasia. Furthermore, the reported numbers of adverse events associated with lengthening procedures using external fixators vary widely. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Does bilateral humeral lengthening with a monolateral external fixator in patients with achondroplasia reliably improve patient function and autonomy, and what proportion of patients achieved at least 8 cm of humeral lengthening? (2) What adverse events occur after bilateral humeral lengthening with monolateral external fixators? METHODS: Between 2011 and 2019, 44 patients underwent humeral lengthening at our institution. Humeral lengthening was performed in patients with severe shortening of the upper extremities and functional impairments. In humeri in which intramedullary devices were not applicable, lengthening was performed with monolateral external fixators in 40 patients. Eight patients were excluded because they underwent unilateral lengthening for etiologies other than achondroplasia, and another four patients did not fulfill the minimum study follow-up period of 2 years, leaving 28 patients with bilateral humeral lengthening to treat achondroplasia available for analysis in this retrospective study. The patients had a median (interquartile range) age of 8 years (8 to 10), and 50% (14 of 28) were girls. The median follow-up time was 6 years (4 to 8). The median humeral lengthening was 9 cm (9 to 10) with a median elongation of 73% (67% to 78%) from an initial median length of 12 cm (11 to 13). To determine whether this treatment reliably improved patient function and autonomy, surgeons retrospectively evaluated patient charts. An unvalidated retrospective patient-reported outcome measure questionnaire consisting of nine items (with answers of \"yes\" or \"no\" or a 5-point Likert scale) was administered to assess the patient's functional improvement in activities of daily living, physical appearance, and overall satisfaction, such that 45 points was the highest possible score. The radiographic outcome was assessed on calibrated radiographs of the humerus. To ascertain the proportion of adverse events, study surgeons performed a chart review and telephone interviews. Major complications were defined as events that resulted in unplanned revision surgery, nerve injury (either temporary or permanent), refracture of the bone regenerate, or permanent functional sequelae. Minor complications were characterized as events that resolved without further surgical interventions. RESULTS: On our unvalidated assessment of patient function and independence, all patients reported improvement at their most recent follow-up compared with scores obtained before treatment (median [IQR] 24 [16 to 28] before surgery versus 44 [42 to 45] at latest follow-up, difference of medians 20 points, p < 0.001). A total of 89% (25 of 28) of patients achieved the desired 8 cm of lengthening in both arms. A total of 50% (14 of 28) of our patients experienced a major complication. Specifically, 39% (11 of 28) had an unplanned reoperation, 39% (11 of 28) had a radial nerve palsy, 18% (5 of 28) had a refracture of the regenerate, and 4% (1 of 28) concluded treatment with a severe limb length discrepancy. In addition, 82% (23 of 28) of our patients experienced minor complications that resolved without further surgery and did not involve radial nerve symptoms. Radial nerve palsy was observed immediately postoperatively in eight of 13 segments, and 1 to 7 days postoperatively in five of 13 segments. The treatment goal was not achieved because of radial nerve palsy in 5% (3 of 56) of lengthened segments, which occurred in 7% (2 of 28) of patients. Full functional recovery of the radial nerve was observed in all patients after a median (IQR) of 3 months (2 to 5). Refractures of bone regenerates were observed in 11% (6 of 56) of humeri in 18% (5 of 28) of patients. Of those refractures, 1 of 6 patients was treated nonsurgically with a hanging cast, while 5 of 6 patients underwent revision surgery with intramedullary rodding. CONCLUSION: Most patients with achondroplasia who underwent humeral lengthening achieved the treatment goal without permanent sequelae; nonetheless, complications of treatment were common, and the road to recovery was long and often complicated, with many patients experiencing problems that were either painful (such as refracture) or bothersome (such as temporary radial nerve palsy). However, using a subjective scale, patients seemed improved after treatment; nevertheless, robust outcomes tools are not available for this condition, and so we must interpret that finding with caution. Considering our discoveries, bilateral humeral lengthening with a monolateral external fixator should only be considered in patients with severe functional impairments because of rhizomelic shortening of the upper extremities. If feasible, internal lengthening devices might be preferable, as these are generally associated with higher patient comfort and decreased complication rates compared with external fixators.

Laminectomy is the mainstay of treatment but this leads to instability and progressive deformity requiring complex fixation. In order to reduce that risk, we developed a novel modified augmented laminoplasty that increases spinal canal diameter while preserving the posterior column stability. METHODS: All laminoplasty cases for spinal compressive achondroplasia from 2006 to 2020 were included. Ten augmentation laminoplasty procedures were performed in 7 children with regular clinical and radiological post-operative follow-up. Kyphotic deformity and clinical outcomes (neurological and urological) were evaluated. RESULTS: At presentation, clinical features included radiculopathy, neurogenic claudication or acute cauda equina compression with sphincter dysfunction. The average age at initial surgery was 11.2 (range 5-16) with a mean follow-up of 5 (range 2-8) years. All patients demonstrated improvement in neurogenic claudication symptoms after surgery; however, bladder dysfunction persisted in some children. In one child, cervical and lumbar augmentation laminoplasties were performed for concomitant disease. Augmentation laminoplasty effectively prevented deformity progression over time in all cases except one where a further revision laminoplasty with extension was required for screw loosening. Despite this, progressive symptomatic kyphotic deformity led to a 360  fixation. Minor complications included one dural breach (repaired intraoperatively) and one superficial wound infection. CONCLUSION: Augmentation laminoplasty is a viable surgical option following laminectomy in achondroplasia patients as an alternative to surgical fixation.

Laminectomy is the mainstay of treatment but this leads to instability and progressive deformity requiring complex fixation. In order to reduce that risk, we developed a novel modified augmented laminoplasty that increases spinal canal diameter while preserving the posterior column stability. METHODS: All laminoplasty cases for spinal compressive achondroplasia from 2006 to 2020 were included. Ten augmentation laminoplasty procedures were performed in 7 children with regular clinical and radiological post-operative follow-up. Kyphotic deformity and clinical outcomes (neurological and urological) were evaluated. RESULTS: At presentation, clinical features included radiculopathy, neurogenic claudication or acute cauda equina compression with sphincter dysfunction. The average age at initial surgery was 11.2 (range 5-16) with a mean follow-up of 5 (range 2-8) years. All patients demonstrated improvement in neurogenic claudication symptoms after surgery; however, bladder dysfunction persisted in some children. In one child, cervical and lumbar augmentation laminoplasties were performed for concomitant disease. Augmentation laminoplasty effectively prevented deformity progression over time in all cases except one where a further revision laminoplasty with extension was required for screw loosening.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Automated bladder scanning has become a principal tool in the assessment and management of chronically debilitated patients residing in skilled nursing facilities, hospices, and acute inpatient settings. To a large extent, the bladder scan, generally performed by nursing staff, has replaced physical examination while addressing the differential diagnoses of anuria or voiding disturbances that require consideration of urinary catheterization. Health care providers can quickly master this easily performed technique, and currently, due to confidence in the bladder scan finding, physical examination with suprapubic palpation and percussion may be carelessly omitted. The case description presented here illustrates how not performing a physical examination can lead to misdiagnosis caused by misinterpretation of bladder scan findings. CASE REPORT A 66-year-old, quadriparetic, chronically ventilated female patient with achondroplasia underwent repeated hospital referrals and bladder catheterizations for presumed flaccid, neurogenic bladder with urinary retention. This postulated diagnosis was based on occasional reports of urinary catheter obstruction as well as on automated bladder scanning indicating a markedly distended bladder. However, the bladder could not be drained by insertion of urinary catheters. Eventually, a proper physical examination excluded the presence of suprapubic fullness compatible with distended bladder and contradicting bladder scan findings, prompting re-examining an overlooked evaluation of computed tomography that reported a huge ovarian cyst. The patient was found to have intact voiding capabilities and is now weaned from the catheter. CONCLUSIONS This case and the literature review underscore drawbacks in automated bladder scanning. This technique should be used as an adjunctive measure rather than a replacement for a physical examination in the evaluation of voiding disturbances, especially when there are discrepancies between bladder scan findings and the volume of urine drained by catheterization.",

An admission MRI spine showed a pathological T1 vertebrae fracture with posterior soft tissue extension compressing and distorting the spinal cord. A CT guided biopsy revealed an LCH. Steroids were avoided to reduce osteopenia risk and further vertebral fragility.

The feasibility of the physical fitness tests and IPAQ was explored. Forty-three adults (22 women) participated. Mean age was 38 years (range 16-69 years). Mean differences (95% CI) for men and women with ACH compared to reference values were: VO2 peak. -7.0 m/min/kg (-13.6 to -0.5, p = .037), and - 7.9 ml/kg/min (-11.6 to -4.3, p < .001); 6MWT -270.8 m (-340.4 to -201.2, p < .001), and - 196.7 m (-244.3 to -149.0, p = .001); 30sSTS -4.6 repetitions (-7.8 to -1.5, p = .006), and - 1.1 repetitions (-3.4 to 1.1, p = .335). There were no differences within ACH participants, except for VO2 peak, where men performed better. Sufficient physical activity (> 600 metabolic equivalent of task weekly) was achieved by 79% of the participants. The feasibility of the 6MWT and 30sSTS was good. There was a strong correlation between the VO2 peak and 6MWT (men: r = 0.63, p = .007; women: r = 0.71, p < .001).

Bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective in treating obesity and related comorbidities, but its feasibility and effectiveness in patients with achondroplasia have not been clearly established. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of bariatric surgery in patients with achondroplasia. SETTING: This study was performed in France, and bariatric surgeons from the Societe Francaise et Francophone de Chirurgie de l'Obesite et des Maladies Metaboliques (French Francophone Society of Surgery for Obesity or Metabolic Diseases) were asked to participate. METHODS: Two adult women with confirmed achondroplasia and a high BMI were selected for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. Preoperative data were collected, including demographic information, comorbidities, and follow-up at 1, 3, and 6 months and 1 year after surgery. Complications were monitored and recorded. RESULTS: Both patients had good excess weight loss outcomes, with an average excess weight loss of 60.5% 1 year after surgery. One patient had a follow-up of 3 years and an excess weight loss of 44%. The surgery was well-tolerated, and no major complications were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Bariatric surgery is feasible and effective in patients with achondroplasia, with good outcomes for excess weight loss and related comorbidities. These findings suggest that bariatric surgery should be considered a treatment option for patients with achondroplasia and obesity.",

We aimed to perform the first study that exclusively analyzed simultaneous bilateral femoral distraction osteogenesis with motorized intramedullary lengthening nails via an antegrade approach in patients with achondroplasia focused on reliability, accuracy, precision, and the evolving complications. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this retrospective singlecenter study we analyzed patients with achondroplasia who underwent simultaneous bilateral femoral lengthening with antegrade intramedullary lengthening nails between October 2014 and April 2019. 15 patients (30 femoral segments) of median age 14 years (interquartile range [IQR] 12-15) were available for analysis. The median follow-up was 29 months (IQR 27-37) after nail implantation. RESULTS: The median distraction length per segment was 49 mm (IQR 47-51) with a median distraction index of 1.0 mm/day (IQR 0.9-1.0), and a median consolidation index of 20 days/cm (IQR 17-23). Reliability of the lengthening nails was 97% and their calculated accuracy and precision were 96% and 95%, respectively. The most common complication was temporary restriction of knee range of motion during distraction in 10 of 30 of the lengthened segments. 1 patient was treated with 2 unplanned additional surgeries due to premature consolidation. CONCLUSION: The method is reliable and accurate with few complications.",

This paper describes our surgical technique and outcomes for bilateral humeral lengthening in achondroplasia patients over 26 years. METHODS: Ours was a retrospective study of 55 patients with achondroplasia-related short stature, in whom bilateral humeral lengthening was performed from 1990 to 2016. We describe the surgical technique and analyze mean gain in humeral length, days using an external fixator, mean percentage of lengthening, external fixation index, type of callus, and complications. Pre- and postoperative radiographic measurements were obtained. Patients also were contacted by telephone and asked about their ability to perform peri-anal self-hygiene and about their overall satisfaction. RESULTS: In total, 110 humeri were lengthened (28 males and 27 females) with medium elongation of 9.5 cm on the right and 9.6 cm on the left, while averaging 220 days in an external fixator. We observed 14 minor complications. There was no significant association between pin position and type of callus, and elongation most often external and in the presence of a straight callus. Before elongation, 77.1% of patients reported difficulties with perineal hygiene and 85.4% could not put their hands in their pockets. Upon completion of lengthening, 100% could perform both tasks and 94.5% were very satisfied. CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral humeral elongation yields significant improvements in patient autonomy, with a relatively low complication rate and very high patient satisfaction.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Many patients with achondroplasia experience functional impairments because of rhizomelic upper extremities (proximal limb shortening). Bilateral humeral lengthening may overcome these functional limitations, but it is associated with several risks, such as radial nerve palsy and insufficient bone regeneration. Only a few studies have reported on patient satisfaction and functional outcome after humeral lengthening in patients with achondroplasia. Furthermore, the reported numbers of adverse events associated with lengthening procedures using external fixators vary widely. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Does bilateral humeral lengthening with a monolateral external fixator in patients with achondroplasia reliably improve patient function and autonomy, and what proportion of patients achieved at least 8 cm of humeral lengthening? (2) What adverse events occur after bilateral humeral lengthening with monolateral external fixators? METHODS: Between 2011 and 2019, 44 patients underwent humeral lengthening at our institution. Humeral lengthening was performed in patients with severe shortening of the upper extremities and functional impairments. In humeri in which intramedullary devices were not applicable, lengthening was performed with monolateral external fixators in 40 patients. Eight patients were excluded because they underwent unilateral lengthening for etiologies other than achondroplasia, and another four patients did not fulfill the minimum study follow-up period of 2 years, leaving 28 patients with bilateral humeral lengthening to treat achondroplasia available for analysis in this retrospective study. The patients had a median (interquartile range) age of 8 years (8 to 10), and 50% (14 of 28) were girls. The median follow-up time was 6 years (4 to 8). The median humeral lengthening was 9 cm (9 to 10) with a median elongation of 73% (67% to 78%) from an initial median length of 12 cm (11 to 13). To determine whether this treatment reliably improved patient function and autonomy, surgeons retrospectively evaluated patient charts. An unvalidated retrospective patient-reported outcome measure questionnaire consisting of nine items (with answers of \"yes\" or \"no\" or a 5-point Likert scale) was administered to assess the patient's functional improvement in activities of daily living, physical appearance, and overall satisfaction, such that 45 points was the highest possible score. The radiographic outcome was assessed on calibrated radiographs of the humerus. To ascertain the proportion of adverse events, study surgeons performed a chart review and telephone interviews. Major complications were defined as events that resulted in unplanned revision surgery, nerve injury (either temporary or permanent), refracture of the bone regenerate, or permanent functional sequelae. Minor complications were characterized as events that resolved without further surgical interventions. RESULTS: On our unvalidated assessment of patient function and independence, all patients reported improvement at their most recent follow-up compared with scores obtained before treatment (median [IQR] 24 [16 to 28] before surgery versus 44 [42 to 45] at latest follow-up, difference of medians 20 points, p < 0.001). A total of 89% (25 of 28) of patients achieved the desired 8 cm of lengthening in both arms. A total of 50% (14 of 28) of our patients experienced a major complication. Specifically, 39% (11 of 28) had an unplanned reoperation, 39% (11 of 28) had a radial nerve palsy, 18% (5 of 28) had a refracture of the regenerate, and 4% (1 of 28) concluded treatment with a severe limb length discrepancy. In addition, 82% (23 of 28) of our patients experienced minor complications that resolved without further surgery and did not involve radial nerve symptoms. Radial nerve palsy was observed immediately postoperatively in eight of 13 segments, and 1 to 7 days postoperatively in five of 13 segments. The treatment goal was not achieved because of radial nerve palsy in 5% (3 of 56) of lengthened segments, which occurred in 7% (2 of 28) of patients. Full functional recovery of the radial nerve was observed in all patients after a median (IQR) of 3 months (2 to 5). Refractures of bone regenerates were observed in 11% (6 of 56) of humeri in 18% (5 of 28) of patients. Of those refractures, 1 of 6 patients was treated nonsurgically with a hanging cast, while 5 of 6 patients underwent revision surgery with intramedullary rodding. CONCLUSION: Most patients with achondroplasia who underwent humeral lengthening achieved the treatment goal without permanent sequelae; nonetheless, complications of treatment were common, and the road to recovery was long and often complicated, with many patients experiencing problems that were either painful (such as refracture) or bothersome (such as temporary radial nerve palsy). However, using a subjective scale, patients seemed improved after treatment; nevertheless, robust outcomes tools are not available for this condition, and so we must interpret that finding with caution. Considering our discoveries, bilateral humeral lengthening with a monolateral external fixator should only be considered in patients with severe functional impairments because of rhizomelic shortening of the upper extremities. If feasible, internal lengthening devices might be preferable, as these are generally associated with higher patient comfort and decreased complication rates compared with external fixators.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Use of the Ilizarov technique for limb lengthening in patients with achondroplasia is controversial, with a high risk of complications balancing cosmetic gains. Although several articles have described the complications of this procedure and satisfaction of patients after surgery, it remains unclear whether lengthening improves the quality of life (QOL) of these patients. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked whether bilateral lower limb lengthenings with deformity correction in patients with achondroplasia would improve QOL and investigated the correlation between complication rate and QOL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 22 patients (average age, 12.7 years) diagnosed with achondroplasia who underwent bilateral lower limb lengthenings between 2002 and 2005. These patients were compared with 22 patients with achondroplasia for whom limb lengthening was not performed. The two groups were assessed using the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) lower limb, SF-36, and Rosenberg self-esteem scores. Minimum followup was 4.5 years (range, 4.5-6.9 years). RESULTS: Among the lengthening group, the average gain in length was 10.21 +- 2.39 cm for the femur and 9.13 +- 2.12 cm for the tibia. A total of 123 complications occurred in these 88 segments. The surgical group had higher Rosenberg self-esteem scores than the nonsurgical group although there were no differences in the AAOS and the SF-36 scores. The self-esteem scores decreased with the increase in the number of complications. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that despite frequent complications, bilateral lower limb lengthening increases patients' QOL. We believe lengthening is a reasonable option in selected patients.

                    "abstract": "Achondroplasia (ACH) is the prototype and most common of the human chondrodysplasias. It results from gain-of-function mutations that exaggerate the signal output of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3), a receptor tyrosine kinase that negatively regulates growth plate activity and linear bone growth. Several approaches to reduce FGFR3 signaling by blocking receptor activation or inhibiting downstream signals have been proposed. Five show promise in preclinical mouse studies. Two candidate therapies target the extracellular domain of FGFR3. The first is a decoy receptor that competes for activating ligands. The second is a synthetic blocking peptide that prevents ligands from binding and activating FGFR3. Two established drugs, statins and meclozine, improve growth of ACH mice. The strongest candidate therapy employs an analog of C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), which antagonizes the mitogen-activated-protein (MAP) kinase pathway downstream of the FGFR3 receptor and may also act independently in the growth plate. Only the CNP analog has reached clinical trials. Preliminary results of Phase 2 studies show a substantial increase in growth rate of ACH children after six months of therapy with no serious adverse effects. A challenge for drug therapy in ACH is targeting agents to the avascular growth plate. The application of gene therapy in osteoarthritis offers insights because it faces similar technical obstacles. Major advances in gene therapy include the emergence of recombinant adeno-associated virus as the vector of choice, capsid engineering to target vectors to specific tissues, and development of methods to direct vectors to articular chondrocytes.

There is consensus that infants and children with achondroplasia should be managed by a multidisciplinary team experienced in the condition. However, many people are lost to follow-up after the transition from paediatric to adult care, and there is no standardised approach for management in adults, despite the recent availability of international consensus guidelines. To address this, the European Achondroplasia Forum has developed a patient-held checklist to support adults with achondroplasia in managing their health. The checklist highlights key symptoms of spinal stenosis and obstructive sleep apnoea, both among the most frequent and potentially severe medical complications in adults with achondroplasia. The checklist acts as a framework to support individuals and their primary care provider in completing a routine review. General advice on issues such as blood pressure, pain, hearing, weight, adaptive aids, and psychosocial aspects are also included. The checklist provides key symptoms to be aware of, in addition to action points so that people can approach their primary care provider and be directed to the appropriate specialist, if needed. Additionally, the European Achondroplasia Forum offers some ideas on implementing the checklist during the transition from paediatric to adult care, thus ensuring the existing multidisciplinary team model in place during childhood can support in engaging individuals and empowering them to take responsibility for their own care as they move into adulthood.",

Methods: The clinical data of 38 patients with lower limb deformity caused by achondroplasia treated by Ilizarov technique between February 2014 and September 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. There were 18 males and 20 females, the age ranged from 7 to 34 years, with an average of 14.8 years. All patients presented with bilateral knee varus deformity. The preoperative varus angles was (15.2+-4.2) , and knee society score (KSS) was 61.8+-7.2. Nine of these patients underwent tibia and fibula osteotomy, 29 cases underwent tibia and fibula osteotomy and bone lengthening at the same time. Full-length bearing position X-ray films of bilateral lower limbs were taken to measure the bilateral varus angles, analyze the healing index, and record the occurrence of complications. KSS score was used to evaluate the improvement of knee joint function before and after operation. Results: All 38 cases were followed up 9-65 months, with an average of 26.3 months. Needle tract infection occurred in 4 cases and needle tract loosening occurred in 2 cases after operation, which were improved after symptomatic treatment such as dressing change, Kirschner wire change, and oral antibiotics, and no neurovascular injury occurred in all patients. The external fixator was worn for 3-11 months after operation, with an average of 7.6 months, and the healing index was 43-59 d/cm, with an average of 50.3 d/cm. At last follow-up, the leg was 3-10 cm longer, with an average of 5.5 cm. The varus angles was (1.5+-0.2)  and the KSS score was 93.7+-2.6, which significantly improved when compared with those before operation ( P<0.05). Conclusion: Ilizarov technique is a safe and effective method for the treatment of short limb with genu varus deformity caused by achondroplasia, which can improve the quality of life of patients.",

Vosoritide is a C-natriuretic peptide analogue that has been shown to improve endochondral ossification in children with achondroplasia. The objective of this trial is to evaluate the safety of vosoritide and whether vosoritide can improve the growth of the foramen magnum and spinal canal in children that may require decompression surgery. An Achondroplasia Foramen Magnum Score will be used to identify infants at risk of requiring decompression surgery. This is a 2-year open label randomized controlled trial of vosoritide in infants with achondroplasia ages 0 to <=12 months. Approximately 20 infants will be randomized 1:1 to either open label once daily subcutaneous vosoritide combined with standard of care or standard of care alone. The primary and secondary aims of the study are to evaluate the safety and efficacy of vosoritide in children with cervicomedullary compression at risk of requiring decompression surgery. The trial will be carried out in specialized skeletal dysplasia treatment centers with well established multidisciplinary care pathways and standardized approaches to the neurosurgical management of cervicomedually compression. After 2 years, infants randomized to standard of care alone will be eligible to switch to vosoritide plus standard of care for an additional 3 years. This pioneering trial hopes to address the important question as to whether treatment with vosoritide at an early age in infants at risk of requiring cervicomedullary decompression surgery is safe, and can improve growth at the foramen magnum and spinal canal alleviating stenosis. This in turn may reduce compression of surrounding structures including the neuraxis and spinal cord, which could alleviate future morbidity and mortality.Trial registrations: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04554940; EudraCT number, 2020-001055-40.",

Both patients underwent decompressive sub-occipitalcraniectomy and C1 laminectomy without duraplasty using iCT.

Due to short stature and kyphoscoliosis, endovascular access (Cannulation) of the coronary arteries is usually extremely difficult in such patients. CASE PRESENTATION: A 33 years old patient, a known case of achondroplasia, presented with epigastric pain for 3 h duration to a university hospital, Sudan. Her height was 95 cm and her weight was 38 Kg. A trans-femoral approach for coronary angioplasty was preferred. After it has been extremely difficult to cannulate the left system at first, the cannulation has been performed successfully using 5F, JL3.5 catheter. The angiogram depicted total occlusion of the proximal right coronary artery which was found to be originating from the left coronary sinus of the aorta. Successful trans-femoral coronary angioplasty has been performed with stent placement, and no complications encountered. During her last follow up, 1 year after the procedure, she appeared to be free of symptoms and with no further ischemic attacks or procedure-related complications. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of successful coronary angioplasty in achondroplasia patient in whom the occluded artery is an anomalous coronary artery. Literature review, description of the achondroplasia, development of the coronary arteries and the hypothesized theory for the anomaly have been described in this case report. The PCI performed has also been clearly and comprehensively described.",

This phase 1 trial was initiated to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics (PD) and pharmacokinetics (PK) of TransCon CNP. METHODS: This randomized, placebo-controlled, single-ascending dose phase 1 trial was performed at two sites in Australia and enrolled 45 healthy adult males. Subjects received placebo or TransCon CNP (single-ascending dose cohorts [3, 10, 25, 75 or 150 mug CNP/kg]). The primary endpoint was frequency of adverse events and other safety outcomes. Other endpoints included PK and PD measured by cyclic guanosine-monophosphate (cGMP) and amino-terminal propeptide of CNP (NTproCNP). RESULTS: TransCon CNP provided continuous systemic exposure to CNP over at least 7 days post-dose. Plasma and urine levels of cGMP were significantly increased in subjects administered TransCon CNP at 75-150 mug CNP/kg, indicating target engagement of active CNP at the natriuretic peptide receptor-B (NPR-B) for at least 1 week post-dose. TransCon CNP was well-tolerated, with no serious treatment-emergent adverse events or discontinuations. Extensive cardiac safety assessments did not reveal any clinically relevant effects on electrocardiogram parameters, including heart rate, PR, QRS and QTcF intervals. CONCLUSIONS: Safety and PD data from this phase 1 trial support that TransCon CNP is well tolerated, with a PK profile compatible with a once-weekly dosing regimen. Further studies are ongoing to evaluate the potential of TransCon CNP to positively impact abnormal endochondral ossification in children with achondroplasia.",

The feasibility of the physical fitness tests and IPAQ was explored. Forty-three adults (22 women) participated. Mean age was 38 years (range 16-69 years). Mean differences (95% CI) for men and women with ACH compared to reference values were: VO2 peak. -7.0 m/min/kg (-13.6 to -0.5, p = .037), and - 7.9 ml/kg/min (-11.6 to -4.3, p < .001); 6MWT -270.8 m (-340.4 to -201.2, p < .001), and - 196.7 m (-244.3 to -149.0, p = .001); 30sSTS -4.6 repetitions (-7.8 to -1.5, p = .006), and - 1.1 repetitions (-3.4 to 1.1, p = .335). There were no differences within ACH participants, except for VO2 peak, where men performed better. Sufficient physical activity (> 600 metabolic equivalent of task weekly) was achieved by 79% of the participants. The feasibility of the 6MWT and 30sSTS was good. There was a strong correlation between the VO2 peak and 6MWT (men: r = 0.63, p = .007; women: r = 0.71, p < .001). The findings indicate that the 6MWT and 30sSTS test are useful in assessing functional exercise capacity and muscle strength in adults with ACH.",

This investigation describes the clinical, radiographic, and genetic features of this entity. METHODS The authors' craniofacial database for the period 1997-2013 was retrospectively culled to identify patients who had a normal or near-normal head shape and CT-confirmed multiple-suture synostosis. Patients with kleeblatt-schadel or previous craniofacial surgery were excluded. All demographic information was collected and analyzed. RESULTS Seventeen patients fit the inclusion criteria. Nine patients had a syndromic diagnosis: Crouzon syndrome (n = 4), Pfeiffer syndrome (n = 2), Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (n = 1), Apert syndrome (n = 1), and achondroplasia (n = 1). With the exception of 3 patients with mild turricephaly, all patients had a relatively normal head shape. Patients were diagnosed at an average age of 62.9 months. Nearly all patients had some combination of clinical, radiographic, or ophthalmological evidence of increased ICP. CONCLUSIONS PPP is insidious; diagnosis is typically delayed because the clinical signs are subtle and appear gradually. All normocephalic infants or children with a known or suspected craniosynostotic disorder should be carefully monitored; any decrease in percentile head circumference or signs/symptoms of increased ICP should prompt CT evaluation.

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Pediatric achondroplasia is often associated with conditions requiring neurosurgical intervention, including CSF diversion and multilevel spinal decompression. However, there is a lack of clinical guidelines and reliable estimates of the benefits and risks of these interventions. This study aimed to summarize the literature on the neurosurgical management of pediatric achondroplasia patients in order to aid in determining optimal treatment and standardization of care. METHODS: A systematic review of peer-reviewed studies with an objective diagnosis of achondroplasia, patient demographic information, and available data on neurosurgical interventions performed before 18 years of age for cervicomedullary compression, spinal stenosis, and hydrocephalus was performed. Study quality and risks of bias were assessed using standardized scores. Independent patient data on surgical indications, outcomes, reoperations, and complication risks were aggregated using means and percentages. RESULTS: Of 204 records, 25 studies with 287 pediatric achondroplasia patients (mean age 25 +- 36 months) treated for cervicomedullary compression (n = 153), spinal stenosis (n = 100), and obstructive hydrocephalus (n = 34) were evaluated. Symptomatic cervicomedullary compression occurred early in life (mean age 31 +- 25 months), with apnea (48%), T2-weighted MRI cord signal (28%), myelopathy (27%), and delayed motor skills (15%) requiring foramen magnum decompression observed in 99% of patients, as well as cervical laminectomy in 65% of patients. Although 91% of treated patients had resolution of symptoms, 2% mortality, 9% reoperation, and 21% complication rates were reported. Spinal stenosis was treated in relatively older children (mean age 13 +- 3 years) with laminectomy (23%), as well as with instrumented fusion (73%) for neurogenic claudication (59%), back pain (15%), and sciatica (8%). Although 95% of patients had symptom resolution after surgery, 17% reported complications and 18% required reoperation. Of the hydrocephalus patients (mean age 56 +- 103 months), half were treated with endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) and half had a shunt placed for progressive ventriculomegaly (66%), headaches (32%), and delayed cognitive development (4%). The shunted patients had a 3% mortality rate and an average of 1.5 shunt revisions per patient. None of the patients who underwent ETV as the primary procedure required a revision. CONCLUSIONS: Neurosurgical intervention for pediatric achondroplasia conditions, including cervicomedullary compression, spinal stenosis, and hydrocephalus, is associated with high recovery rates and good outcomes. However, complications and reoperations are common. Further studies with follow-up into adulthood are needed to evaluate the long-term outcomes.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Achondroplasia is the most common form of dwarfism. Respiratory failure is responsible for most deaths among these children and is often related to cervicomedullary compression (CMC). We present our experience with early cervicomedullary decompression in infants with achondroplasia. METHODS: Data was retrospectively collected for infants with achondroplasia who underwent CMC decompression between 1998 and 2013. Data included presurgical and postsurgical neurological examinations, MRI scans, and sleep study results. RESULTS: Ten infants were included. Ages at surgery were 4 to 23 months (12.5 +- 6.88 months). All infants displayed neurological findings prior to surgery, although often subtle. All infants underwent a foramen magnum opening with a wide C1 laminectomy. Following surgery, seven patients (70 %) demonstrated improved neurological status, and one displayed neurological deterioration. Seven patients demonstrated improved sleep quality 1 year after surgery. These patients had a good or improved neurological status following surgery. Preoperative radiological findings included abnormal hyperintense T2 changes in all children (improved following surgery in six children), brainstem distortion in four children (improved in all), and diminished cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) spaces at the level of the foramen magnum in eight children (improved in seven). One child with extensive preoperative T2 changes accompanied by neurological and respiratory decline, deteriorated following surgery, and remains chronically ventilated. CONCLUSIONS: Infants with achondroplasia are prone to neurological and respiratory symptoms. We believe that early diagnosis and early surgery for decompression of the foramen magnum and C1 lamina can alleviate respiratory symptoms, improve neurological status, and perhaps prevent sudden infant death in this population.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to describe the frequency and risk factors for orthopedic surgery in patients with achondroplasia. CLARITY (The Achondroplasia Natural History Study) includes clinical data from achondroplasia patients receiving treatment at four skeletal dysplasia centers in the United States from 1957 to 2018. Data were entered and stored in a Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) database. RESULTS: Information from one thousand three hundred and seventy-four patients with achondroplasia were included in this study. Four hundred and eight (29.7%) patients had at least one orthopedic surgery during their lifetime and 299 (21.8%) patients underwent multiple procedures. 12.7% (n = 175) of patients underwent spine surgery at a mean age at first surgery of 22.4 +- 15.3 years old. The median age was 16.7 years old (0.1-67.4). 21.2% (n = 291) of patients underwent lower extremity surgery at a mean age at first surgery of 9.9 +- 8.3 years old with a median age of 8.2 years (0.2-57.8). The most common spinal procedure was decompression (152 patients underwent 271 laminectomy procedures), while the most common lower extremity procedure was osteotomy (200 patients underwent 434 procedures). Fifty-eight (4.2%) patients had both a spine and lower extremity surgery. Specific risk factors increasing the likelihood of orthopedic surgery included: patients with hydrocephalus requiring shunt placement having higher odds of undergoing spine surgery (OR 1.97, 95% CI 1.14-3.26); patients having a cervicomedullary decompression also had higher odds of undergoing spine surgery (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.30-2.63); and having lower extremity surgery increased the odds of spine surgery (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.45-2.90). CONCLUSIONS: Orthopedic surgery was a common occurrence in achondroplasia with 29.7% of patients undergoing at least one orthopedic procedure. Spine surgery (12.7%) was less common and occurred at a later age than lower extremity surgery (21.2%). Cervicomedullary decompression and hydrocephalus with shunt placement were associated with an increased risk for spine surgery. The results from CLARITY, the largest natural history study of achondroplasia, should aid clinicians in counseling patients and families about orthopedic surgery.",

                    "abstract": "Achondroplasia (ACH) is the prototype and most common of the human chondrodysplasias. It results from gain-of-function mutations that exaggerate the signal output of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3), a receptor tyrosine kinase that negatively regulates growth plate activity and linear bone growth. Several approaches to reduce FGFR3 signaling by blocking receptor activation or inhibiting downstream signals have been proposed. Five show promise in preclinical mouse studies. Two candidate therapies target the extracellular domain of FGFR3. The first is a decoy receptor that competes for activating ligands. The second is a synthetic blocking peptide that prevents ligands from binding and activating FGFR3. Two established drugs, statins and meclozine, improve growth of ACH mice. The strongest candidate therapy employs an analog of C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), which antagonizes the mitogen-activated-protein (MAP) kinase pathway downstream of the FGFR3 receptor and may also act independently in the growth plate. Only the CNP analog has reached clinical trials. Preliminary results of Phase 2 studies show a substantial increase in growth rate of ACH children after six months of therapy with no serious adverse effects. A challenge for drug therapy in ACH is targeting agents to the avascular growth plate. The application of gene therapy in osteoarthritis offers insights because it faces similar technical obstacles. Major advances in gene therapy include the emergence of recombinant adeno-associated virus as the vector of choice, capsid engineering to target vectors to specific tissues, and development of methods to direct vectors to articular chondrocytes.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Automated bladder scanning has become a principal tool in the assessment and management of chronically debilitated patients residing in skilled nursing facilities, hospices, and acute inpatient settings. To a large extent, the bladder scan, generally performed by nursing staff, has replaced physical examination while addressing the differential diagnoses of anuria or voiding disturbances that require consideration of urinary catheterization. Health care providers can quickly master this easily performed technique, and currently, due to confidence in the bladder scan finding, physical examination with suprapubic palpation and percussion may be carelessly omitted. The case description presented here illustrates how not performing a physical examination can lead to misdiagnosis caused by misinterpretation of bladder scan findings. CASE REPORT A 66-year-old, quadriparetic, chronically ventilated female patient with achondroplasia underwent repeated hospital referrals and bladder catheterizations for presumed flaccid, neurogenic bladder with urinary retention. This postulated diagnosis was based on occasional reports of urinary catheter obstruction as well as on automated bladder scanning indicating a markedly distended bladder. However, the bladder could not be drained by insertion of urinary catheters. Eventually, a proper physical examination excluded the presence of suprapubic fullness compatible with distended bladder and contradicting bladder scan findings, prompting re-examining an overlooked evaluation of computed tomography that reported a huge ovarian cyst. The patient was found to have intact voiding capabilities and is now weaned from the catheter. CONCLUSIONS This case and the literature review underscore drawbacks in automated bladder scanning. This technique should be used as an adjunctive measure rather than a replacement for a physical examination in the evaluation of voiding disturbances, especially when there are discrepancies between bladder scan findings and the volume of urine drained by catheterization.",

The aim of the study was to describe the sleep characteristics, underlying disorders, management, and outcome of children with CSA. PATIENTS/METHODS: A retrospective chart review of all children >1 year of age, diagnosed with CSA on a laboratory sleep study during a 20-month period, was performed. CSA was defined by a central apnea index (CAI) >5 events/h. The clinical management and the patient's outcome were analyzed. RESULTS: Eighteen of 441 (4.1%) patients recorded during the study period had CSA. The median CAI, pulse oximetry, and oxygen desaturation index were 13/h (range 6-146), 96% (93-98%), and 18/h (6-98), respectively. Neurosurgical pathologies represented the most common underlying disorders with Arnold-Chiari malformation in four and ganglioglioma in three patients. Other underlying disorders were Prader-Willi syndrome (N = 3), achondroplasia (N = 2), and Down syndrome, with one patient having an achondroplasia and a Down syndrome. The remaining six patients had other genetic diseases. The most common investigation was brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Individualized management with neurosurgery and/or chemotherapy, continuous positive airway pressure (in two patients having associated obstructive events), or noninvasive ventilation resulted in an improvement in CSA and the clinical presentation in 11 patients. CONCLUSION: CSA is rare in children >1 year of age. Underlying disorders are dominated by neurosurgical disorders. Individualized management is able to improve CSA and the clinical condition in most patients.",

This phase 1 trial was initiated to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics (PD) and pharmacokinetics (PK) of TransCon CNP. METHODS: This randomized, placebo-controlled, single-ascending dose phase 1 trial was performed at two sites in Australia and enrolled 45 healthy adult males. Subjects received placebo or TransCon CNP (single-ascending dose cohorts [3, 10, 25, 75 or 150 mug CNP/kg]). The primary endpoint was frequency of adverse events and other safety outcomes. Other endpoints included PK and PD measured by cyclic guanosine-monophosphate (cGMP) and amino-terminal propeptide of CNP (NTproCNP). RESULTS: TransCon CNP provided continuous systemic exposure to CNP over at least 7 days post-dose. Plasma and urine levels of cGMP were significantly increased in subjects administered TransCon CNP at 75-150 mug CNP/kg, indicating target engagement of active CNP at the natriuretic peptide receptor-B (NPR-B) for at least 1 week post-dose. TransCon CNP was well-tolerated, with no serious treatment-emergent adverse events or discontinuations. Extensive cardiac safety assessments did not reveal any clinically relevant effects on electrocardiogram parameters, including heart rate, PR, QRS and QTcF intervals. CONCLUSIONS: Safety and PD data from this phase 1 trial support that TransCon CNP is well tolerated, with a PK profile compatible with a once-weekly dosing regimen. Further studies are ongoing to evaluate the potential of TransCon CNP to positively impact abnormal endochondral ossification in children with achondroplasia.",

Due to short stature and kyphoscoliosis, endovascular access (Cannulation) of the coronary arteries is usually extremely difficult in such patients. CASE PRESENTATION: A 33 years old patient, a known case of achondroplasia, presented with epigastric pain for 3 h duration to a university hospital, Sudan. Her height was 95 cm and her weight was 38 Kg. A trans-femoral approach for coronary angioplasty was preferred. After it has been extremely difficult to cannulate the left system at first, the cannulation has been performed successfully using 5F, JL3.5 catheter. The angiogram depicted total occlusion of the proximal right coronary artery which was found to be originating from the left coronary sinus of the aorta. Successful trans-femoral coronary angioplasty has been performed with stent placement, and no complications encountered. During her last follow up, 1 year after the procedure, she appeared to be free of symptoms and with no further ischemic attacks or procedure-related complications. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of successful coronary angioplasty in achondroplasia patient in whom the occluded artery is an anomalous coronary artery. Literature review, description of the achondroplasia, development of the coronary arteries and the hypothesized theory for the anomaly have been described in this case report. The PCI performed has also been clearly and comprehensively described.",

Average healing index was 30.56 days/cm (range : 17.46-4232). There was a significant difference in healing index between achondroplasia patients (28.79 days/cm) compared to others (33.41 days/cm). Minor problems included pin tract infection (14 segments). More important obstacles were temporary elbow flexion contracture (7 segments), premature consolidation (6 segments), radial nerve dysaesthesia (6 segments) and loosening of a Schanz screw (1 segment). Complications included one fracture and one progressive bowing after frame removal. One planned lengthening was not completely achieved. Despite a lot of obstacles, humeral lengthening using an Ilizarov frame provided a reliable method to treat the functional or cosmetic problems of upper limb shortening.",

An admission MRI spine showed a pathological T1 vertebrae fracture with posterior soft tissue extension compressing and distorting the spinal cord. A CT guided biopsy revealed an LCH. Steroids were avoided to reduce osteopenia risk and further vertebral fragility. Considering the risk of a thoracic surgical approach in a child with this background, he was managed conservatively with indomethacin and a Sternal Occipital Mandibular Immobilizer (SOMI) Brace.

                    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of routine (planned) antenatal nonstress tests (NSTs) in pregnant women with preexisting diabetes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective single-center study of 642 consecutive pregnancies in women with preexisting diabetes who gave birth to a singleton >=22 weeks. Weekly planned NSTs were commenced at 33-35 weeks. In pregnancies with maternal-fetal complications, the initiation and frequency of the planned NST were individualized. Daily maternal assessment of fetal activity was recommended from 28 weeks, and decreased fetal activity indicated an unplanned NST. Data were collected from medical records, and local and regional databases. RESULTS: In total, 3016 planned NSTs were performed, with a median of five (range 0-12) tests per pregnancy. Ninety-five planned NSTs (3.1%) were abnormal, a finding confirmed by retesting the same day in eight cases (8.4%), thus leading to delivery. Complications were present in seven of these eight pregnancies, whereas no fetal movements for the last 3 days were reported when the planned NST was performed in the eighth pregnancy. When specifically asked, five of the eight women stated that they had observed decreased fetal activity preceding the planned NST. In 86 pregnancies (13.4%), maternal perception of decreased fetal activity indicated in total 127 unplanned NSTs. The combination of decreased fetal activity and further obstetrical assessment led to delivery in 10 of these pregnancies (11.6%). One stillbirth occurred at 37 weeks in a pregnancy complicated by fetal achondroplasia and polyhydramnios, where the weekly planned NSTs had been normal. The overall stillbirth rate was thus 1.6/1000. CONCLUSIONS: Routine use of planned antenatal NSTs does not appear to be indicated in pregnancies in women with preexisting diabetes in the absence of maternal-fetal complications.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to describe the frequency and risk factors for orthopedic surgery in patients with achondroplasia. CLARITY (The Achondroplasia Natural History Study) includes clinical data from achondroplasia patients receiving treatment at four skeletal dysplasia centers in the United States from 1957 to 2018. Data were entered and stored in a Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) database. RESULTS: Information from one thousand three hundred and seventy-four patients with achondroplasia were included in this study. Four hundred and eight (29.7%) patients had at least one orthopedic surgery during their lifetime and 299 (21.8%) patients underwent multiple procedures. 12.7% (n = 175) of patients underwent spine surgery at a mean age at first surgery of 22.4 +- 15.3 years old. The median age was 16.7 years old (0.1-67.4). 21.2% (n = 291) of patients underwent lower extremity surgery at a mean age at first surgery of 9.9 +- 8.3 years old with a median age of 8.2 years (0.2-57.8). The most common spinal procedure was decompression (152 patients underwent 271 laminectomy procedures), while the most common lower extremity procedure was osteotomy (200 patients underwent 434 procedures). Fifty-eight (4.2%) patients had both a spine and lower extremity surgery. Specific risk factors increasing the likelihood of orthopedic surgery included: patients with hydrocephalus requiring shunt placement having higher odds of undergoing spine surgery (OR 1.97, 95% CI 1.14-3.26); patients having a cervicomedullary decompression also had higher odds of undergoing spine surgery (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.30-2.63); and having lower extremity surgery increased the odds of spine surgery (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.45-2.90). CONCLUSIONS: Orthopedic surgery was a common occurrence in achondroplasia with 29.7% of patients undergoing at least one orthopedic procedure. Spine surgery (12.7%) was less common and occurred at a later age than lower extremity surgery (21.2%). Cervicomedullary decompression and hydrocephalus with shunt placement were associated with an increased risk for spine surgery. The results from CLARITY, the largest natural history study of achondroplasia, should aid clinicians in counseling patients and families about orthopedic surgery.",

Both patients underwent decompressive sub-occipitalcraniectomy and C1 laminectomy without duraplasty using iCT. It clearly showed the extent of FM decompression during surgery, which finally enabled sufficient decompression. After the operation, their myelopathy improved. We think that iCT can provide useful information and guidance for sufficient decompression for FM stenosis in children with achondroplasia. ",

                    "abstract": "Achondroplasia (ACH) is the prototype and most common of the human chondrodysplasias. It results from gain-of-function mutations that exaggerate the signal output of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3), a receptor tyrosine kinase that negatively regulates growth plate activity and linear bone growth. Several approaches to reduce FGFR3 signaling by blocking receptor activation or inhibiting downstream signals have been proposed. Five show promise in preclinical mouse studies. Two candidate therapies target the extracellular domain of FGFR3. The first is a decoy receptor that competes for activating ligands. The second is a synthetic blocking peptide that prevents ligands from binding and activating FGFR3. Two established drugs, statins and meclozine, improve growth of ACH mice. The strongest candidate therapy employs an analog of C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), which antagonizes the mitogen-activated-protein (MAP) kinase pathway downstream of the FGFR3 receptor and may also act independently in the growth plate. Only the CNP analog has reached clinical trials. Preliminary results of Phase 2 studies show a substantial increase in growth rate of ACH children after six months of therapy with no serious adverse effects. A challenge for drug therapy in ACH is targeting agents to the avascular growth plate. The application of gene therapy in osteoarthritis offers insights because it faces similar technical obstacles. Major advances in gene therapy include the emergence of recombinant adeno-associated virus as the vector of choice, capsid engineering to target vectors to specific tissues, and development of methods to direct vectors to articular chondrocytes.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Use of the Ilizarov technique for limb lengthening in patients with achondroplasia is controversial, with a high risk of complications balancing cosmetic gains. Although several articles have described the complications of this procedure and satisfaction of patients after surgery, it remains unclear whether lengthening improves the quality of life (QOL) of these patients. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked whether bilateral lower limb lengthenings with deformity correction in patients with achondroplasia would improve QOL and investigated the correlation between complication rate and QOL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 22 patients (average age, 12.7 years) diagnosed with achondroplasia who underwent bilateral lower limb lengthenings between 2002 and 2005. These patients were compared with 22 patients with achondroplasia for whom limb lengthening was not performed. The two groups were assessed using the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) lower limb, SF-36, and Rosenberg self-esteem scores. Minimum followup was 4.5 years (range, 4.5-6.9 years). RESULTS: Among the lengthening group, the average gain in length was 10.21 +- 2.39 cm for the femur and 9.13 +- 2.12 cm for the tibia. A total of 123 complications occurred in these 88 segments. The surgical group had higher Rosenberg self-esteem scores than the nonsurgical group although there were no differences in the AAOS and the SF-36 scores. The self-esteem scores decreased with the increase in the number of complications. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that despite frequent complications, bilateral lower limb lengthening increases patients' QOL. We believe lengthening is a reasonable option in selected patients. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, therapeutic study. See the Guidelines for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.",

This includes the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) filling mechanism that leads to an increase in mode pressure if excess fluid volume exacerbates the obstructive process. Elevation in mode occurs because pressure in the central nervous system (CNS) represents a state of reduced flow, rather than an abnormality of volume. Diseases that cause elevated mode pressure by means of a primary edema can lead to hydrocephalus if there is sufficient time and obstruction to flow for the filling mechanism to act. Hydrocephalus is driven primarily by labile pressure due to restricted compliance, it can expand skeletal compartments and deplete parenchyma volume as it advances. This hypothesis applies existing principles of water balance. It is part of a series of works that propose a spectrum of hydrocephalic disorders including developmental forms such as achondroplasia with other conditions such as functional trapped fourth ventricle, arachnoid cyst, syringomyelia and normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). Links between the conditions can be made by understanding the continuously variable pressure profile local to the cavity that is subject to filling. Fluid lesions of the brain or spine that arise from developmental malformations of the skull have a physiological component. Changes form part of the mechanisms that may compensate the disease process.",

The pan-FGFR inhibitor erdafitinib was approved for the treatment of mUC with FGFR3 alterations but is limited due to FGFR isoform off-target toxicities and the development of on-target gatekeeper resistance mutations. TYRA-300 (22) was conceived using a structure-based approach as a potent FGFR3-selective inhibitor to avoid the toxicities associated with inhibition of FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR4, and to be agnostic for the FGFR3 gatekeeper mutations.

Vosoritide is a biologic analogue of C-type natriuretic peptide, a potent stimulator of endochondral ossification. METHODS: In a multinational, phase 2, dose-finding study and extension study, we evaluated the safety and side-effect profile of vosoritide in children (5 to 14 years of age) with achondroplasia. A total of 35 children were enrolled in four sequential cohorts to receive vosoritide at a once-daily subcutaneous dose of 2.5 mug per kilogram of body weight (8 patients in cohort 1), 7.5 mug per kilogram (8 patients in cohort 2), 15.0 mug per kilogram (10 patients in cohort 3), or 30.0 mug per kilogram (9 patients in cohort 4). After 6 months, the dose in cohort 1 was increased to 7.5 mug per kilogram and then to 15.0 mug per kilogram, and in cohort 2, the dose was increased to 15.0 mug per kilogram; the patients in cohorts 3 and 4 continued to receive their initial doses. At the time of data cutoff, the 24-month dose-finding study had been completed, and 30 patients had been enrolled in an ongoing long-term extension study; the median duration of follow-up across both studies was 42 months. RESULTS: During the treatment periods in the dose-finding and extension studies, adverse events occurred in 35 of 35 patients (100%), and serious adverse events occurred in 4 of 35 patients (11%). Therapy was discontinued in 6 patients (in 1 because of an adverse event). During the first 6 months of treatment, a dose-dependent increase in the annualized growth velocity was observed with vosoritide up to a dose of 15.0 mug per kilogram, and a sustained increase in the annualized growth velocity was observed at doses of 15.0 and 30.0 mug per kilogram for up to 42 months. CONCLUSIONS: In children with achondroplasia, once-daily subcutaneous administration of vosoritide was associated with a side-effect profile that appeared generally mild. Treatment resulted in a sustained increase in the annualized growth velocity for up to 42 months.

Methods: The clinical data of 38 patients with lower limb deformity caused by achondroplasia treated by Ilizarov technique between February 2014 and September 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. There were 18 males and 20 females, the age ranged from 7 to 34 years, with an average of 14.8 years. All patients presented with bilateral knee varus deformity. The preoperative varus angles was (15.2+-4.2) , and knee society score (KSS) was 61.8+-7.2. Nine of these patients underwent tibia and fibula osteotomy, 29 cases underwent tibia and fibula osteotomy and bone lengthening at the same time. Full-length bearing position X-ray films of bilateral lower limbs were taken to measure the bilateral varus angles, analyze the healing index, and record the occurrence of complications. KSS score was used to evaluate the improvement of knee joint function before and after operation. Results: All 38 cases were followed up 9-65 months, with an average of 26.3 months. Needle tract infection occurred in 4 cases and needle tract loosening occurred in 2 cases after operation, which were improved after symptomatic treatment such as dressing change, Kirschner wire change, and oral antibiotics, and no neurovascular injury occurred in all patients. The external fixator was worn for 3-11 months after operation, with an average of 7.6 months, and the healing index was 43-59 d/cm, with an average of 50.3 d/cm. At last follow-up, the leg was 3-10 cm longer, with an average of 5.5 cm. The varus angles was (1.5+-0.2)  and the KSS score was 93.7+-2.6, which significantly improved when compared with those before operation ( P<0.05). Conclusion: Ilizarov technique is a safe and effective method for the treatment of short limb with genu varus deformity caused by achondroplasia, which can improve the quality of life of patients.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Achondroplasia is the most common form of dwarfism. Respiratory failure is responsible for most deaths among these children and is often related to cervicomedullary compression (CMC). We present our experience with early cervicomedullary decompression in infants with achondroplasia. METHODS: Data was retrospectively collected for infants with achondroplasia who underwent CMC decompression between 1998 and 2013. Data included presurgical and postsurgical neurological examinations, MRI scans, and sleep study results. RESULTS: Ten infants were included. Ages at surgery were 4 to 23 months (12.5 +- 6.88 months). All infants displayed neurological findings prior to surgery, although often subtle. All infants underwent a foramen magnum opening with a wide C1 laminectomy. Following surgery, seven patients (70 %) demonstrated improved neurological status, and one displayed neurological deterioration. Seven patients demonstrated improved sleep quality 1 year after surgery. These patients had a good or improved neurological status following surgery. Preoperative radiological findings included abnormal hyperintense T2 changes in all children (improved following surgery in six children), brainstem distortion in four children (improved in all), and diminished cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) spaces at the level of the foramen magnum in eight children (improved in seven). One child with extensive preoperative T2 changes accompanied by neurological and respiratory decline, deteriorated following surgery, and remains chronically ventilated. CONCLUSIONS: Infants with achondroplasia are prone to neurological and respiratory symptoms. We believe that early diagnosis and early surgery for decompression of the foramen magnum and C1 lamina can alleviate respiratory symptoms, improve neurological status, and perhaps prevent sudden infant death in this population.",

Her first delivery had been performed by C/S under general anesthesia at a regional hospital 6 years before. Preoperative airway assessment showed normal mouth opening and mobile cervical spine. Since she had anxiety about needle puncture and refused neuraxial blockade and since we considered the trachea could be intubated, we decided to perform C/S under general anesthesia at 37 weeks of gestation. The patient and baby had an uneventful perioperative course. Underdevelopment of bone formation results in characteristic craniofacial and vertebral abnormalities in patients with achondroplasia. Anesthetic management of achondroplastic parturients should be specified to individual basis based on careful preoperative assessment of craniofacial and vertebral deformities.",

This includes the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) filling mechanism that leads to an increase in mode pressure if excess fluid volume exacerbates the obstructive process. Elevation in mode occurs because pressure in the central nervous system (CNS) represents a state of reduced flow, rather than an abnormality of volume. Diseases that cause elevated mode pressure by means of a primary edema can lead to hydrocephalus if there is sufficient time and obstruction to flow for the filling mechanism to act. Hydrocephalus is driven primarily by labile pressure due to restricted compliance, it can expand skeletal compartments and deplete parenchyma volume as it advances. This hypothesis applies existing principles of water balance. It is part of a series of works that propose a spectrum of hydrocephalic disorders including developmental forms such as achondroplasia with other conditions such as functional trapped fourth ventricle, arachnoid cyst, syringomyelia and normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). Links between the conditions can be made by understanding the continuously variable pressure profile local to the cavity that is subject to filling. Fluid lesions of the brain or spine that arise from developmental malformations of the skull have a physiological component. Changes form part of the mechanisms that may compensate the disease process.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Pediatric achondroplasia is often associated with conditions requiring neurosurgical intervention, including CSF diversion and multilevel spinal decompression. However, there is a lack of clinical guidelines and reliable estimates of the benefits and risks of these interventions. This study aimed to summarize the literature on the neurosurgical management of pediatric achondroplasia patients in order to aid in determining optimal treatment and standardization of care. METHODS: A systematic review of peer-reviewed studies with an objective diagnosis of achondroplasia, patient demographic information, and available data on neurosurgical interventions performed before 18 years of age for cervicomedullary compression, spinal stenosis, and hydrocephalus was performed. Study quality and risks of bias were assessed using standardized scores. Independent patient data on surgical indications, outcomes, reoperations, and complication risks were aggregated using means and percentages. RESULTS: Of 204 records, 25 studies with 287 pediatric achondroplasia patients (mean age 25 +- 36 months) treated for cervicomedullary compression (n = 153), spinal stenosis (n = 100), and obstructive hydrocephalus (n = 34) were evaluated. Symptomatic cervicomedullary compression occurred early in life (mean age 31 +- 25 months), with apnea (48%), T2-weighted MRI cord signal (28%), myelopathy (27%), and delayed motor skills (15%) requiring foramen magnum decompression observed in 99% of patients, as well as cervical laminectomy in 65% of patients. Although 91% of treated patients had resolution of symptoms, 2% mortality, 9% reoperation, and 21% complication rates were reported. Spinal stenosis was treated in relatively older children (mean age 13 +- 3 years) with laminectomy (23%), as well as with instrumented fusion (73%) for neurogenic claudication (59%), back pain (15%), and sciatica (8%). Although 95% of patients had symptom resolution after surgery, 17% reported complications and 18% required reoperation. Of the hydrocephalus patients (mean age 56 +- 103 months), half were treated with endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) and half had a shunt placed for progressive ventriculomegaly (66%), headaches (32%), and delayed cognitive development (4%). The shunted patients had a 3% mortality rate and an average of 1.5 shunt revisions per patient. None of the patients who underwent ETV as the primary procedure required a revision. CONCLUSIONS: Neurosurgical intervention for pediatric achondroplasia conditions, including cervicomedullary compression, spinal stenosis, and hydrocephalus, is associated with high recovery rates and good outcomes. However, complications and reoperations are common. Further studies with follow-up into adulthood are needed to evaluate the long-term outcomes.",

Vosoritide is a C-natriuretic peptide analogue that has been shown to improve endochondral ossification in children with achondroplasia. The objective of this trial is to evaluate the safety of vosoritide and whether vosoritide can improve the growth of the foramen magnum and spinal canal in children that may require decompression surgery. An Achondroplasia Foramen Magnum Score will be used to identify infants at risk of requiring decompression surgery. This is a 2-year open label randomized controlled trial of vosoritide in infants with achondroplasia ages 0 to <=12 months. Approximately 20 infants will be randomized 1:1 to either open label once daily subcutaneous vosoritide combined with standard of care or standard of care alone. The primary and secondary aims of the study are to evaluate the safety and efficacy of vosoritide in children with cervicomedullary compression at risk of requiring decompression surgery. The trial will be carried out in specialized skeletal dysplasia treatment centers with well established multidisciplinary care pathways and standardized approaches to the neurosurgical management of cervicomedually compression. After 2 years, infants randomized to standard of care alone will be eligible to switch to vosoritide plus standard of care for an additional 3 years. This pioneering trial hopes to address the important question as to whether treatment with vosoritide at an early age in infants at risk of requiring cervicomedullary decompression surgery is safe, and can improve growth at the foramen magnum and spinal canal alleviating stenosis. This in turn may reduce compression of surrounding structures including the neuraxis and spinal cord, which could alleviate future morbidity and mortality.Trial registrations: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04554940; EudraCT number, 2020-001055-40.",

The pharmacokinetics of vosoritide and relationships between plasma exposure and efficacy, biomarkers, and safety endpoints were evaluated in a phase II, open-label, dose-escalation study (N = 35 patients aged 5-14 years who received daily subcutaneous injections for 24 months) and a phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (N = 60 patients aged 5-18 years randomized to receive daily subcutaneous injections for 52 weeks). METHODS: Pharmacokinetic parameters for both studies were obtained from non-compartmental analysis. Potential correlations between vosoritide exposure and changes in annualized growth velocity, collagen type X marker (CXM; a biomarker of endochondral ossification), cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP; a biomarker of pharmacological activity), heart rate, and systolic and diastolic blood pressures were then evaluated. RESULTS: The exposure-response relationships for changes in both annualized growth velocity and the CXM biomarker saturated at 15 mug/kg, while systemic pharmacological activity, as measured by urinary cGMP, was near maximal or saturated at exposures obtained at the highest dose studied (i.e. 30 mug/kg). This suggested that the additional bioactivity was likely in tissues not related to endochondral bone formation. In the phase III study, following subcutaneous administration at the recommended dose of 15 mug/kg to patients with achondroplasia aged 5-18 years, vosoritide was rapidly absorbed with a median time to maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) of 15 minutes, and cleared with a mean half-life of 27.9 minutes after 52 weeks of treatment. Vosoritide exposure (Cmax and area under the concentration-time curve [AUC]) was consistent across visits. No evidence of accumulation with once-daily dosing was observed. Total anti-vosoritide antibody (TAb) responses were detected in the serum of 25 of 60 (42%) treated patients in the phase III study, with no apparent impact of TAb development noted on annualized growth velocity or vosoritide exposure. Across the exposure range obtained with 15 microg/kg in the phase III study, no meaningful correlations between vosoritide plasma exposure and changes in annualized growth velocity or CXM, or changes from predose heart rate, and systolic or diastolic blood pressures were observed. CONCLUSIONS: The results support the recommended dose of vosoritide 15 microg/kg for once-daily subcutaneous administration in patients with achondroplasia aged >= 5 years whose epiphyses are not closed.

Multilevel Ossification of the ligamentum flavum in the spine is a rare occurrence which too can contribute to stenosed canal.

She presented in the outpatient department with bilateral weakness in legs with complete foot drop on the left side and was non-ambulatory. She was managed surgically by instrumentation with multiple interbody fusions with wide decompression and excision of OLF. The patient responded well to the surgery and became a walker after 2-year follow-up. DISCUSSION: Achondroplasic patients may present rarely with multiregional and multilevel OLF. It is important to identify them preoperatively so as to have good surgical outcome. Wide laminectomy, removal of the ossified ligament, and fusion with instrumentation resulted in the improvement of the patient's neurological symptoms and functions.",

This includes the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) filling mechanism that leads to an increase in mode pressure if excess fluid volume exacerbates the obstructive process. Elevation in mode occurs because pressure in the central nervous system (CNS) represents a state of reduced flow, rather than an abnormality of volume. Diseases that cause elevated mode pressure by means of a primary edema can lead to hydrocephalus if there is sufficient time and obstruction to flow for the filling mechanism to act. Hydrocephalus is driven primarily by labile pressure due to restricted compliance, it can expand skeletal compartments and deplete parenchyma volume as it advances. This hypothesis applies existing principles of water balance. It is part of a series of works that propose a spectrum of hydrocephalic disorders including developmental forms such as achondroplasia with other conditions such as functional trapped fourth ventricle, arachnoid cyst, syringomyelia and normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). Links between the conditions can be made by understanding the continuously variable pressure profile local to the cavity that is subject to filling. Fluid lesions of the brain or spine that arise from developmental malformations of the skull have a physiological component. Changes form part of the mechanisms that may compensate the disease process.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Achondroplasia is a genetic disorder that inhibits endochondral ossification, resulting in disproportionate short stature and clinically significant medical complications. Vosoritide is a biologic analogue of C-type natriuretic peptide, a potent stimulator of endochondral ossification. METHODS: In a multinational, phase 2, dose-finding study and extension study, we evaluated the safety and side-effect profile of vosoritide in children (5 to 14 years of age) with achondroplasia. A total of 35 children were enrolled in four sequential cohorts to receive vosoritide at a once-daily subcutaneous dose of 2.5 mug per kilogram of body weight (8 patients in cohort 1), 7.5 mug per kilogram (8 patients in cohort 2), 15.0 mug per kilogram (10 patients in cohort 3), or 30.0 mug per kilogram (9 patients in cohort 4). After 6 months, the dose in cohort 1 was increased to 7.5 mug per kilogram and then to 15.0 mug per kilogram, and in cohort 2, the dose was increased to 15.0 mug per kilogram; the patients in cohorts 3 and 4 continued to receive their initial doses. At the time of data cutoff, the 24-month dose-finding study had been completed, and 30 patients had been enrolled in an ongoing long-term extension study; the median duration of follow-up across both studies was 42 months. RESULTS: During the treatment periods in the dose-finding and extension studies, adverse events occurred in 35 of 35 patients (100%), and serious adverse events occurred in 4 of 35 patients (11%). Therapy was discontinued in 6 patients (in 1 because of an adverse event). During the first 6 months of treatment, a dose-dependent increase in the annualized growth velocity was observed with vosoritide up to a dose of 15.0 mug per kilogram, and a sustained increase in the annualized growth velocity was observed at doses of 15.0 and 30.0 mug per kilogram for up to 42 months. CONCLUSIONS: In children with achondroplasia, once-daily subcutaneous administration of vosoritide was associated with a side-effect profile that appeared generally mild. Treatment resulted in a sustained increase in the annualized growth velocity for up to 42 months.

METHODS: In this study 20 patients (50 lower extremity long bones) who underwent PAL or CM were divided into 2 cohort groups. The amount of lengthening, percentage lengthening, external fixator index (EFI), external fixator time, Li regeneration index, complication rate, and knee range of motion (ROM) were compared between the groups. RESULTS: The median age was 9.4 years (range 6-16 years) in the PAL group and 12 years (range 9-16 years) in the CM group (p = 0.01). Males comprised 80% of the patients in the PAL group and 47% of the patients in the CM group (p = 0.02). The median amount of lengthening in the PAL and CM groups was 7.5 cm (range 5.5-9.5 cm) and 6.0 cm (range 5.5-9.0 cm), respectively (p < 0.01). The median percentage of lengthening in the PAL and CM groups was 44.6% (range 20.0-70.1%) and 43.0% (range 20.5-57.3%), respectively (p = 0.01). The median external fixator time in the PAL and CM groups was 127 days (range 94-185 days) and 180 days (range 105-355 days), respectively (p < 0.01). The median EFI in the PAL and CM groups was 21 days/cm (range 10-33 days/cm) and 27 days/cm (range 15-59 days/cm), respectively (p < 0.01). The Li regeneration index was 3 (interquartile range, IQR 2-4) in both groups (p = 0.2). The total complication rate was similar between the groups. CONCLUSION: In patients with achondroplasia, after lengthening with an external fixator, internal fixation with a plate can be a reliable alternative to the conventional method.

The aim of this study was to determine the factors influencing this complication. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and eleven cases of lower limb lengthening were performed in 58 patients (40 femurs and 71 tibias). The mean age at surgery was 10.1years old. Lengthening was performed in all cases with an external fixator alone, associated in 39.6% of cases with intramedullary nailing. The patients were divided into three groups according to disease etiology (congenital, achondroplasia and other). The fractures were classified according to the Simpson classification. RESULTS: Twenty fractures were recorded (18%). Sixteen fractures were found in patients with congenital disease, four with achondroplasia and none in the group of other etiologies. The fracture was more often in the femur (27.5%) than in the tibia (12.7%). DISCUSSION: The rate of fracture is influenced by different factors depending on the etiology of disease. In congenital diseases, the fracture rate is higher when there is lengthening of more than 15% of the initial length and a delay between surgery and the beginning of lengthening of less than 7days. In patients with achondroplasia, the influence of a relative percentage of lengthening is less important than in those with congenital disease. However, to avoid fractures, lengthening should not be started in children under the age of nine. Moreover, lengthening should begin at least 7days after the fixator has been placed.

We analyzed medical data of 22 adult patients (8 males and 14 females) treated with GH at a dose of 0.05 mg/kg/day. Optionally, tibial lengthening (TL) was performed with the Ilizalov method in 15 patients and TL as well as femoral lengthening (FL) in 6 patients. Concomitant gonadal suppression therapy with buserelin acetate was applied in 13 patients. The mean treatment periods with GH were 10.7 +- 4.0 and 9.3 +- 2.5 years for males and females, respectively. GH treatment augmented the final height +0.60 +- 0.52 SD (+3.5 cm) and +0.51 +- 1.29 SD (+2.8 cm) in males and females compared to non-treated ACH patients, respectively. Final height of ACH patients that underwent GH and TL increased +1.72 +- 0.72 SD (+10.0 cm) and +1.95 +- 1.34 SD (+9.8 cm) in males and females, respectively. GH, TL, and FL increased their final height +2.97 SD (+17.2 cm) and +3.41 +- 1.63 SD (+17.3 cm) in males and females, respectively. Gonadal suppression therapy had no impact on final height. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term GH treatment contributes to 2.6 and 2.1% of final adult height in male and female ACH patients, respectively.",

The study included patients with a genetically confirmed diagnosis of achondroplasia. The experimental group consisted of 14 patients who underwent surgical limb lengthening by the rod monolateral external fixator with a distraction system developed by the authors. The lengthening was performed on 28 segments of tubular bones. The majority of the experimental group patients achieved the lengthening value close to the planned one and the deformation correction. The fixation period was averagely 83.8 +- 3.7 days, the regenerate length was 8.5 +- 0.6 cm, and the mechanical strength of the distraction regenerate was 10.3  +- 2.18 . The rod external fixator with a control distraction system developed by the authors has small dimensions and low weight of the external supporting elements of high durability. It is reported to provide a good psychological tolerance of the treatment process and significantly outperforms the circular multi-axis system. Considering the aforementioned, the proposed apparatus can grant good orthopedic care to patients with achondroplasia.",

Mean age at start of surgery was 17.05 years (range : 5-40). The mean lengthening achieved was 8.85 (3-13) cm. Mean lengthening percentage was 353% (range : 10-48). Average healing index was 30.56 days/cm (range : 17.46-4232). There was a significant difference in healing index between achondroplasia patients (28.79 days/cm) compared to others (33.41 days/cm). Minor problems included pin tract infection (14 segments). More important obstacles were temporary elbow flexion contracture (7 segments), premature consolidation (6 segments), radial nerve dysaesthesia (6 segments) and loosening of a Schanz screw (1 segment). Complications included one fracture and one progressive bowing after frame removal. One planned lengthening was not completely achieved.

However, there is a lack of clinical guidelines and reliable estimates of the benefits and risks of these interventions. This study aimed to summarize the literature on the neurosurgical management of pediatric achondroplasia patients in order to aid in determining optimal treatment and standardization of care. METHODS: A systematic review of peer-reviewed studies with an objective diagnosis of achondroplasia, patient demographic information, and available data on neurosurgical interventions performed before 18 years of age for cervicomedullary compression, spinal stenosis, and hydrocephalus was performed. Study quality and risks of bias were assessed using standardized scores. Independent patient data on surgical indications, outcomes, reoperations, and complication risks were aggregated using means and percentages. RESULTS: Of 204 records, 25 studies with 287 pediatric achondroplasia patients (mean age 25 +- 36 months) treated for cervicomedullary compression (n = 153), spinal stenosis (n = 100), and obstructive hydrocephalus (n = 34) were evaluated. Symptomatic cervicomedullary compression occurred early in life (mean age 31 +- 25 months), with apnea (48%), T2-weighted MRI cord signal (28%), myelopathy (27%), and delayed motor skills (15%) requiring foramen magnum decompression observed in 99% of patients, as well as cervical laminectomy in 65% of patients. Although 91% of treated patients had resolution of symptoms, 2% mortality, 9% reoperation, and 21% complication rates were reported. Spinal stenosis was treated in relatively older children (mean age 13 +- 3 years) with laminectomy (23%), as well as with instrumented fusion (73%) for neurogenic claudication (59%), back pain (15%), and sciatica (8%). Although 95% of patients had symptom resolution after surgery, 17% reported complications and 18% required reoperation. Of the hydrocephalus patients (mean age 56 +- 103 months), half were treated with endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) and half had a shunt placed for progressive ventriculomegaly (66%), headaches (32%), and delayed cognitive development (4%). The shunted patients had a 3% mortality rate and an average of 1.5 shunt revisions per patient. None of the patients who underwent ETV as the primary procedure required a revision. CONCLUSIONS: Neurosurgical intervention for pediatric achondroplasia conditions, including cervicomedullary compression, spinal stenosis, and hydrocephalus, is associated with high recovery rates and good outcomes. However, complications and reoperations are common. Further studies with follow-up into adulthood are needed to evaluate the long-term outcomes.",

This disease is characterized by short stature and a variety of complications, some of which can be quite severe. RECENT FINDINGS: Despite several attempts to standardize care, there is still no widely accepted consensus. This is in part due to absence of concrete data on the incidence of sudden unexplained death in infants with achondroplasia and the best investigation for ascertaining which individuals could benefit from foramen magnum decompression surgery. In this review, we identify the different options of care and management for the various orthopedic, neurologic, and respiratory complications. In parallel, several innovative or drug repositioning therapies are being investigated that would restore bone growth but may also prevent complications.

Multilevel Ossification of the ligamentum flavum in the spine is a rare occurrence which too can contribute to stenosed canal. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of an Indian achondroplasic dwarf with multilevel ossification of ligamentum flavum (OLF) at thoracic and lumbar segment. She presented in the outpatient department with bilateral weakness in legs with complete foot drop on the left side and was non-ambulatory. She was managed surgically by instrumentation with multiple interbody fusions with wide decompression and excision of OLF. The patient responded well to the surgery and became a walker after 2-year follow-up. DISCUSSION: Achondroplasic patients may present rarely with multiregional and multilevel OLF. It is important to identify them preoperatively so as to have good surgical outcome. Wide laminectomy, removal of the ossified ligament, and fusion with instrumentation resulted in the improvement of the patient's neurological symptoms and functions.",

Her first delivery had been performed by C/S under general anesthesia at a regional hospital 6 years before. Preoperative airway assessment showed normal mouth opening and mobile cervical spine. Since she had anxiety about needle puncture and refused neuraxial blockade and since we considered the trachea could be intubated, we decided to perform C/S under general anesthesia at 37 weeks of gestation. The patient and baby had an uneventful perioperative course. Underdevelopment of bone formation results in characteristic craniofacial and vertebral abnormalities in patients with achondroplasia.

In this patient, Down syndrome was clinically recognised and confirmed by the cytogenetic finding of mosaic karyotype (47,XX,+21/46,XX) shortly after birth. She was subsequently diagnosed with hypochondroplasia at the age of 6 years when disproportional short stature, stocky habitus and macrocephaly were observed. These phenotypic findings were later confirmed by the presence of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene mutation N540K. The overlapping common clinical features of Down syndrome and hypochondroplasia resulted in delayed diagnosis of hypochondroplasia in our patient and the associated deleterious effect on her linear growth.

We analyzed medical data of 22 adult patients (8 males and 14 females) treated with GH at a dose of 0.05 mg/kg/day. Optionally, tibial lengthening (TL) was performed with the Ilizalov method in 15 patients and TL as well as femoral lengthening (FL) in 6 patients. Concomitant gonadal suppression therapy with buserelin acetate was applied in 13 patients. The mean treatment periods with GH were 10.7 +- 4.0 and 9.3 +- 2.5 years for males and females, respectively. GH treatment augmented the final height +0.60 +- 0.52 SD (+3.5 cm) and +0.51 +- 1.29 SD (+2.8 cm) in males and females compared to non-treated ACH patients, respectively. Final height of ACH patients that underwent GH and TL increased +1.72 +- 0.72 SD (+10.0 cm) and +1.95 +- 1.34 SD (+9.8 cm) in males and females, respectively. GH, TL, and FL increased their final height +2.97 SD (+17.2 cm) and +3.41 +- 1.63 SD (+17.3 cm) in males and females, respectively. Gonadal suppression therapy had no impact on final height.

We analyzed medical data of 22 adult patients (8 males and 14 females) treated with GH at a dose of 0.05 mg/kg/day. Optionally, tibial lengthening (TL) was performed with the Ilizalov method in 15 patients and TL as well as femoral lengthening (FL) in 6 patients. Concomitant gonadal suppression therapy with buserelin acetate was applied in 13 patients. The mean treatment periods with GH were 10.7 +- 4.0 and 9.3 +- 2.5 years for males and females, respectively. GH treatment augmented the final height +0.60 +- 0.52 SD (+3.5 cm) and +0.51 +- 1.29 SD (+2.8 cm) in males and females compared to non-treated ACH patients, respectively. Final height of ACH patients that underwent GH and TL increased +1.72 +- 0.72 SD (+10.0 cm) and +1.95 +- 1.34 SD (+9.8 cm) in males and females, respectively. GH, TL, and FL increased their final height +2.97 SD (+17.2 cm) and +3.41 +- 1.63 SD (+17.3 cm) in males and females, respectively. Gonadal suppression therapy had no impact on final height.

An open-label study suggested that vosoritide administration might increase growth velocity in children with achondroplasia. This phase 3 trial was designed to further assess these preliminary findings. METHODS: This randomised, double-blind, phase 3, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial compared once-daily subcutaneous administration of vosoritide with placebo in children with achondroplasia. The trial was done in hospitals at 24 sites in seven countries (Australia, Germany, Japan, Spain, Turkey, the USA, and the UK). Eligible patients had a clinical diagnosis of achondroplasia, were ambulatory, had participated for 6 months in a baseline growth study and were aged 5 to less than 18 years at enrolment. Randomisation was done by means of a voice or web-response system, stratified according to sex and Tanner stage. Participants, investigators, and trial sponsor were masked to group assignment. Participants received either vosoritide 15 0 mug/kg or placebo, as allocated, for the duration of the 52-week treatment period administered by daily subcutaneous injections in their homes by trained caregivers. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in mean annualised growth velocity at 52 weeks in treated patients as compared with controls. All randomly assigned patients were included in the efficacy analyses (n=121). All patients who received one dose of vosoritide or placebo (n=121) were included in the safety analyses. The trial is complete and is registered, with EudraCT, number, 2015-003836-11. FINDINGS: All participants were recruited from Dec 12, 2016, to Nov 7, 2018, with 60 assigned to receive vosoritide and 61 to receive placebo. Of 124 patients screened for eligibility, 121 patients were randomly assigned, and 119 patients completed the 52-week trial. The adjusted mean difference in annualised growth velocity between patients in the vosoritide group and placebo group was 1 57 cm/year in favour of vosoritide (95% CI [1 22-1 93]; two-sided p<0 0001). A total of 119 patients had at least one adverse event; vosoritide group, 59 (98%), and placebo group, 60 (98%). None of the serious adverse events were considered to be treatment related and no deaths occurred. INTERPRETATION: Vosoritide is an effective treatment to increase growth in children with achondroplasia. It is not known whether final adult height will be increased, or what the harms of long-term therapy might be. FUNDING: BioMarin Pharmaceutical.",

This study examined the impact of demographic, clinical, and technology-related factors on long-term NIV adverse events in a large cohort of children using long-term NIV. METHODS: This was a multicenter retrospective review of all children who initiated long-term NIV in the province of Alberta, Canada, from January 2005 to September 2014, and followed until December 2015. Inclusion criteria were children who had used NIV for 3 months or more and had at least one follow-up visit with the NIV programs. RESULTS: We identified 507 children who initiated NIV at a median age of 7.5 (interquartile range: 8.6) years and 93% of them reported at least one NIV-related adverse event during the initial follow-up visit. Skin injury (20%) and unintentional air leaks (19%) were reported more frequently at the initial visit. Gastrointestinal symptoms, midface hypoplasia, increased drooling, aspiration and pneumothorax were rarely reported (<5%). Younger age and underlying conditions such as Down syndrome, achondroplasia, and Duchenne muscular dystrophy were early predictors of unintentional air leak. Younger age also predicted child sleep disruption in the short term and ongoing parental sleep disruption. Obesity was a risk factor for persistent nasal symptoms. Mask type was not a significant predictor for NIV-related short- or long-term complications. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that NIV-related complications are frequent. Appropriate mask-fitting and headgear adaptation, and a proactive approach to early detection may help to reduce adverse events.",

There is consensus that infants and children with achondroplasia should be managed by a multidisciplinary team experienced in the condition. However, many people are lost to follow-up after the transition from paediatric to adult care, and there is no standardised approach for management in adults, despite the recent availability of international consensus guidelines. To address this, the European Achondroplasia Forum has developed a patient-held checklist to support adults with achondroplasia in managing their health. The checklist highlights key symptoms of spinal stenosis and obstructive sleep apnoea, both among the most frequent and potentially severe medical complications in adults with achondroplasia. The checklist acts as a framework to support individuals and their primary care provider in completing a routine review. General advice on issues such as blood pressure, pain, hearing, weight, adaptive aids, and psychosocial aspects are also included. The checklist provides key symptoms to be aware of, in addition to action points so that people can approach their primary care provider and be directed to the appropriate specialist, if needed. Additionally, the European Achondroplasia Forum offers some ideas on implementing the checklist during the transition from paediatric to adult care, thus ensuring the existing multidisciplinary team model in place during childhood can support in engaging individuals and empowering them to take responsibility for their own care as they move into adulthood.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Although humeral lengthening in patients with achondroplasia is an accepted procedure for improving functional status, there is still a paucity of information about the effectiveness of the method. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of humeral lengthening using monolateral fixators in patients with achondroplasia and unilateral shortening. METHODS: Twenty-one patients (31 humeri) were included in this study. The study group consisted of eight patients with achondroplasia (16 segments). The control group consisted of 13 patients with post-septic shortening of the humerus (15 segments). All subjects underwent distraction osteogenesis with the use of a monolateral fixator. RESULTS: The mean lengthening in the patients with achondroplasia was 8.29 cm, whereas in the control group it was 7.34 cm (p = 0.1677). The mean lengthening percentage in the patients with achondroplasia (50% of the initial length of the humerus) was significantly greater than in the control group (33% of the initial length of the humerus) (p = 0.0007). The mean healing index was 24.8 days/cm in the patients with achondroplasia and 28.56 days/cm in the control group (p = 0.1832). The overall complication rates for the achondroplastic and post-septic patients were, respectively, 175% and 160% (p = 0.1420). CONCLUSIONS: Humeral lengthening with use of monolateral fixators in patients with achondroplasia is an efficient method. Although the segment lengthening percentage is significantly greater in patients with achondroplasia than in patients with post-septic shortening of the humerus, the safety of this procedure is comparable.",

We retrospectively reviewed 26 humeral segments in 17 patients that were lengthened at our department between 1993 and 2011. There were varying aetiologies including achondroplasia, epiphyseal dysplasia, Oilier disease, trauma or infection of the proximal humeral growth-plate, unicameral bone cyst and brachial plexus injury. Mean age at start of surgery was 17.05 years (range : 5-40). The mean lengthening achieved was 8.85 (3-13) cm. Mean lengthening percentage was 353% (range : 10-48). Average healing index was 30.56 days/cm (range : 17.46-4232). There was a significant difference in healing index between achondroplasia patients (28.79 days/cm) compared to others (33.41 days/cm). Minor problems included pin tract infection (14 segments). More important obstacles were temporary elbow flexion contracture (7 segments), premature consolidation (6 segments), radial nerve dysaesthesia (6 segments) and loosening of a Schanz screw (1 segment). Complications included one fracture and one progressive bowing after frame removal. One planned lengthening was not completely achieved. Despite a lot of obstacles, humeral lengthening using an Ilizarov frame provided a reliable method to treat the functional or cosmetic problems of upper limb shortening.",

METHODS: Fifty-four humeral lengthening procedures performed in 27 achondroplastic patients were reviewed. Elongations were performed by means of callotasis with unilateral external fixation. Inclusion criteria were: achondroplastic patients under 17 years without prior arm operations and minimum follow-up of 36 months. RESULTS: Fifty humeri in 25 patients (13 men and 12 women), aged between 9 and 17 years, met the inclusion criteria. Mean humeral lengthening was 8.82 cm (range: 5 to 10.5 cm), which represented an elongation of 54.80% (range: 46% to 63%) of the original length. The healing index was 0.91 months (range: 0.72 to 1.4 mo) per centimeter gained. Shoulder and elbow range of motion and stability were preserved in 47 limbs. Noncomplicated cases consistently experienced a significant functional improvement in the performance of activities of daily living such as putting on footwear and personal hygiene. Short-term complications included 11 pin-tract infections, 1 radial nerve neuropraxia, and 1 failure of the regenerated bone formation. None of these complications prevented from completion of treatment. Long-term complications included 2 cases of nonunion, 3 elbow flexion contractures, and 2 cases of psychological dissatisfaction, all of them in 4 patients. Factors associated with long-term complications were intraoperative fragment displacement and distal humeral osteotomy. No fractures of the regenerated bone were identified in the long term. CONCLUSIONS: Callotasis with unilateral external fixation is a reliable and well-tolerated procedure for humeral lengthening in achondroplastic patients, with an acceptable complication rate. Guided fixator placement and a proximal humeral osteotomy are strongly recommended technical tips as they may help prevent complications and improve outcomes.

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Vosoritide is administered as a daily subcutaneous injection in children with achondroplasia. In clinical trials, families of children aged 2-4 years reported difficulty with drug administration due to child fear, pain, and distress. Study aims were to gain a better understanding of the current vosoritide administration experience in this cohort and to investigate whether topical anaesthesia and ice application prior to injections improved the child and family experience. DESIGN AND METHODS: A qualitative descriptive study design ensured in-depth understanding of family experience. Parents were interviewed to explore experience of vosoritide administration for their child at two time points, before (Phase 1) and after (Phase 2) the introduction of topical anaesthesia and ice application prior to injections. Interviews were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Seven families participated. Children's ages ranged from 2 years 2 months to 3 years 11 months. Five themes emerged from data analysis: (1) The reality of the burden of care; (2) Child experience as the greatest obstacle; (3) Parents juggle multiple emotional considerations; (4) Many factors may impact experience; and (5) Short-term and long-term impacts. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of vosoritide in this cohort presents multiple challenges for families. Factors which influenced experience differed between families. Responses to topical anaesthesia and ice application also varied between children, improving administration experience for some children and worsening experience for others. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: This study highlights the need for individualised care for young children receiving daily injections. Support should be provided to families to identify factors that improve experience.",

Despite having aroused interest at the end of the 20 h century, there are still only very little data available on this aspect of the pathology. Today, interest is rising again, and some studies are now proposing mechanistic hypotheses and guidance for patient management. These data confirm that obesity is a major health problem in achondroplasia necessitating an early yet complex clinical management. Anticipatory care should be directed at identifying children who are at high risk to develop obesity and intervening to prevent the metabolic complications in adults. In this review, we are regrouping available data characterizing obesity in achondroplasia and we are identifying the current tools used to monitor obesity in these patients.",

Vosoritide is a C-natriuretic peptide analogue that has been shown to improve endochondral ossification in children with achondroplasia. The objective of this trial is to evaluate the safety of vosoritide and whether vosoritide can improve the growth of the foramen magnum and spinal canal in children that may require decompression surgery. An Achondroplasia Foramen Magnum Score will be used to identify infants at risk of requiring decompression surgery. This is a 2-year open label randomized controlled trial of vosoritide in infants with achondroplasia ages 0 to <=12 months. Approximately 20 infants will be randomized 1:1 to either open label once daily subcutaneous vosoritide combined with standard of care or standard of care alone. The primary and secondary aims of the study are to evaluate the safety and efficacy of vosoritide in children with cervicomedullary compression at risk of requiring decompression surgery. The trial will be carried out in specialized skeletal dysplasia treatment centers with well established multidisciplinary care pathways and standardized approaches to the neurosurgical management of cervicomedually compression. After 2 years, infants randomized to standard of care alone will be eligible to switch to vosoritide plus standard of care for an additional 3 years. This pioneering trial hopes to address the important question as to whether treatment with vosoritide at an early age in infants at risk of requiring cervicomedullary decompression surgery is safe, and can improve growth at the foramen magnum and spinal canal alleviating stenosis. This in turn may reduce compression of surrounding structures including the neuraxis and spinal cord, which could alleviate future morbidity and mortality.Trial registrations: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04554940; EudraCT number, 2020-001055-40.",

This includes the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) filling mechanism that leads to an increase in mode pressure if excess fluid volume exacerbates the obstructive process. Elevation in mode occurs because pressure in the central nervous system (CNS) represents a state of reduced flow, rather than an abnormality of volume. Diseases that cause elevated mode pressure by means of a primary edema can lead to hydrocephalus if there is sufficient time and obstruction to flow for the filling mechanism to act. Hydrocephalus is driven primarily by labile pressure due to restricted compliance, it can expand skeletal compartments and deplete parenchyma volume as it advances. This hypothesis applies existing principles of water balance. It is part of a series of works that propose a spectrum of hydrocephalic disorders including developmental forms such as achondroplasia with other conditions such as functional trapped fourth ventricle, arachnoid cyst, syringomyelia and normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). Links between the conditions can be made by understanding the continuously variable pressure profile local to the cavity that is subject to filling. Fluid lesions of the brain or spine that arise from developmental malformations of the skull have a physiological component. Changes form part of the mechanisms that may compensate the disease process.",

                    "abstract": "Achondroplasia (ACH) is the prototype and most common of the human chondrodysplasias. It results from gain-of-function mutations that exaggerate the signal output of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3), a receptor tyrosine kinase that negatively regulates growth plate activity and linear bone growth. Several approaches to reduce FGFR3 signaling by blocking receptor activation or inhibiting downstream signals have been proposed. Five show promise in preclinical mouse studies. Two candidate therapies target the extracellular domain of FGFR3. The first is a decoy receptor that competes for activating ligands. The second is a synthetic blocking peptide that prevents ligands from binding and activating FGFR3. Two established drugs, statins and meclozine, improve growth of ACH mice. The strongest candidate therapy employs an analog of C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), which antagonizes the mitogen-activated-protein (MAP) kinase pathway downstream of the FGFR3 receptor and may also act independently in the growth plate. Only the CNP analog has reached clinical trials. Preliminary results of Phase 2 studies show a substantial increase in growth rate of ACH children after six months of therapy with no serious adverse effects. A challenge for drug therapy in ACH is targeting agents to the avascular growth plate. The application of gene therapy in osteoarthritis offers insights because it faces similar technical obstacles. Major advances in gene therapy include the emergence of recombinant adeno-associated virus as the vector of choice, capsid engineering to target vectors to specific tissues, and development of methods to direct vectors to articular chondrocytes.

Due to a shortage of hospital beds and economic constraints, we started a program for outpatient initiation of CPAP in selected children with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). METHODS: Objective CPAP compliance and efficacy were evaluated in consecutive children enrolled in an outpatient CPAP program when they fulfilled the following criteria: persistent OSA, age >6 months, stable condition, family living in the Parisian area and agreeing with a regular follow-up. RESULTS: Thirty-one children, median (range) age 8.9 years (0.8-17.5), were included in the program. The most common diagnosis were Down syndrome (n = 7), achondroplasia (n = 3), and obesity (n = 3). Median baseline obstructive apnea-hypopnea index (OAHI) was 12.5 events/h (5-100). Median duration of follow-up was 12.3 months (2.2-25.2). Four subjects (three adolescents with Down syndrome) were not compliant at 2-month follow-up with a compliance <4 h/night. In the other 27 subjects, median compliance was 08:21 h:min/night (05:45-12:20), with a median number of night use per month of 25 (18-30). CPAP efficacy at the end of follow-up was excellent in the compliant subjects with a median AHI of two events/h (0-4) and normal gas exchange with CPAP therapy. Three subjects were successfully weaned from CPAP treatment during the study period. CONCLUSION: Initiating CPAP in an outpatient setting in children is feasible and effective in selected subjects. A high rate of compliance can be achieved as well as a correction of OSA.",

We aimed to perform the first study that exclusively analyzed simultaneous bilateral femoral distraction osteogenesis with motorized intramedullary lengthening nails via an antegrade approach in patients with achondroplasia focused on reliability, accuracy, precision, and the evolving complications. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this retrospective singlecenter study we analyzed patients with achondroplasia who underwent simultaneous bilateral femoral lengthening with antegrade intramedullary lengthening nails between October 2014 and April 2019. 15 patients (30 femoral segments) of median age 14 years (interquartile range [IQR] 12-15) were available for analysis. The median follow-up was 29 months (IQR 27-37) after nail implantation. RESULTS: The median distraction length per segment was 49 mm (IQR 47-51) with a median distraction index of 1.0 mm/day (IQR 0.9-1.0), and a median consolidation index of 20 days/cm (IQR 17-23). Reliability of the lengthening nails was 97% and their calculated accuracy and precision were 96% and 95%, respectively. The most common complication was temporary restriction of knee range of motion during distraction in 10 of 30 of the lengthened segments. 1 patient was treated with 2 unplanned additional surgeries due to premature consolidation. CONCLUSION: The method is reliable and accurate with few complications.",

She presented in the outpatient department with bilateral weakness in legs with complete foot drop on the left side and was non-ambulatory. She was managed surgically by instrumentation with multiple interbody fusions with wide decompression and excision of OLF. The patient responded well to the surgery and became a walker after 2-year follow-up. DISCUSSION: Achondroplasic patients may present rarely with multiregional and multilevel OLF.

However, there is a lack of clinical guidelines and reliable estimates of the benefits and risks of these interventions. This study aimed to summarize the literature on the neurosurgical management of pediatric achondroplasia patients in order to aid in determining optimal treatment and standardization of care. METHODS: A systematic review of peer-reviewed studies with an objective diagnosis of achondroplasia, patient demographic information, and available data on neurosurgical interventions performed before 18 years of age for cervicomedullary compression, spinal stenosis, and hydrocephalus was performed. Study quality and risks of bias were assessed using standardized scores. Independent patient data on surgical indications, outcomes, reoperations, and complication risks were aggregated using means and percentages. RESULTS: Of 204 records, 25 studies with 287 pediatric achondroplasia patients (mean age 25 +- 36 months) treated for cervicomedullary compression (n = 153), spinal stenosis (n = 100), and obstructive hydrocephalus (n = 34) were evaluated. Symptomatic cervicomedullary compression occurred early in life (mean age 31 +- 25 months), with apnea (48%), T2-weighted MRI cord signal (28%), myelopathy (27%), and delayed motor skills (15%) requiring foramen magnum decompression observed in 99% of patients, as well as cervical laminectomy in 65% of patients. Although 91% of treated patients had resolution of symptoms, 2% mortality, 9% reoperation, and 21% complication rates were reported. Spinal stenosis was treated in relatively older children (mean age 13 +- 3 years) with laminectomy (23%), as well as with instrumented fusion (73%) for neurogenic claudication (59%), back pain (15%), and sciatica (8%). Although 95% of patients had symptom resolution after surgery, 17% reported complications and 18% required reoperation. Of the hydrocephalus patients (mean age 56 +- 103 months), half were treated with endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) and half had a shunt placed for progressive ventriculomegaly (66%), headaches (32%), and delayed cognitive development (4%). The shunted patients had a 3% mortality rate and an average of 1.5 shunt revisions per patient. None of the patients who underwent ETV as the primary procedure required a revision. CONCLUSIONS: Neurosurgical intervention for pediatric achondroplasia conditions, including cervicomedullary compression, spinal stenosis, and hydrocephalus, is associated with high recovery rates and good outcomes. However, complications and reoperations are common. Further studies with follow-up into adulthood are needed to evaluate the long-term outcomes.",

It is characterized by bone growth abnormalities that are well characterized and by a strong predisposition to abdominal obesity for which causes are unknown. Despite having aroused interest at the end of the 20 h century, there are still only very little data available on this aspect of the pathology. Today, interest is rising again, and some studies are now proposing mechanistic hypotheses and guidance for patient management. These data confirm that obesity is a major health problem in achondroplasia necessitating an early yet complex clinical management. Anticipatory care should be directed at identifying children who are at high risk to develop obesity and intervening to prevent the metabolic complications in adults. In this review, we are regrouping available data characterizing obesity in achondroplasia and we are identifying the current tools used to monitor obesity in these patients.",

Potential medical complications associated with achondroplasia include lower extremity long bone bowing, middle-ear dysfunction, obstructive sleep apnea, and, more rarely, cervicomedullary compression, hydrocephalus, thoracolumbar kyphosis, and central sleep apnea. This is the second revision to the original 1995 health supervision guidance from the American Academy of Pediatrics for caring for patients with achondroplasia. Although many of the previously published recommendations remain appropriate for contemporary medical care, this document highlights interval advancements in the clinical methods available to monitor for complications associated with achondroplasia. This document is intended to provide guidance for health care providers to help identify individual patients at high risk of developing serious sequelae and to enable intervention before complications develop.",

The aim of this study was to determine the factors influencing this complication. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and eleven cases of lower limb lengthening were performed in 58 patients (40 femurs and 71 tibias). The mean age at surgery was 10.1years old. Lengthening was performed in all cases with an external fixator alone, associated in 39.6% of cases with intramedullary nailing. The patients were divided into three groups according to disease etiology (congenital, achondroplasia and other). The fractures were classified according to the Simpson classification. RESULTS: Twenty fractures were recorded (18%). Sixteen fractures were found in patients with congenital disease, four with achondroplasia and none in the group of other etiologies. The fracture was more often in the femur (27.5%) than in the tibia (12.7%). DISCUSSION: The rate of fracture is influenced by different factors depending on the etiology of disease. In congenital diseases, the fracture rate is higher when there is lengthening of more than 15% of the initial length and a delay between surgery and the beginning of lengthening of less than 7days. In patients with achondroplasia, the influence of a relative percentage of lengthening is less important than in those with congenital disease. However, to avoid fractures, lengthening should not be started in children under the age of nine. Moreover, lengthening should begin at least 7days after the fixator has been placed.

However, previous studies have indicated that acute implant-related issues still occur in the adult population. Reports of pediatric acute implant complications, occurring within 3 months of surgery, are under-represented in the literature. The purpose of this study is to document the prevalence of acute implant-related complications in a pediatric cervical fusion population. METHODS: A retrospective review of instrumented cervical fusions from August 2002 to December 2018 was conducted. Acute implant-related complications were defined as malposition, fracture, or disengagement of cervical instrumentation, including screws, rods, and plates, within 90 days of surgery. RESULTS: A total of 166 cases were included (55% male individuals) with an average age at surgery of 12.5 years (SD, +-5.28). Acute implant-related complications occurred in 5 patients (3%). All 5 patients had a syndromic diagnosis: Loeys-Dietz (n=1), osteopetrosis (n=1), neurofibromatosis (n=1), trisomy 20 (n=1), and achondroplasia (n=1). One case involved asymptomatic screw protrusion, 1 case lateral mass screw pull-out, 2 more had screw-rod disengagement, and the last experienced dislodgement of the anterior plate. The median time until the presentation was 25 days (range, 1 to 79 d). All patients (n=5) required surgical revision. CONCLUSIONS: This case series suggests that the overall incidence of acute cervical implant failure is low. However, failure is more likely to occur in patients with underlying syndromes compared with patients with different etiologies. Intraoperative use of 3-dimensional computed tomography imaging is recommended to evaluate the screw position and potentially avoid later surgery.",

KEY POINTS: The report discusses current research findings on the cardiopulmonary exercise performance of children (and adolescents) with juvenile idiopathic arthritis, osteogenesis imperfecta, achondroplasia, hemophilia, cerebral palsy, spina bifida, cystic fibrosis, and childhood cancer. Exercise recommendations and contraindications are provided for each condition. Implications for clinical practice and future research in this area are discussed for each of the chronic conditions presented. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The authors provide a basic framework for developing an individual and/or disease-specific training program, introduce the physical activity pyramid, and recommend a core set of clinical measures to be used in clinical research.",

Glucocorticoids and physical therapy are the mainstay of treatment. Exercise intolerance is the hallmark of metabolic myopathies, which require a combination of laboratory testing, electrodiagnostic testing, and muscle biopsy for diagnosis. Joint hypermobility may be an isolated finding or be associated with hypermobility Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), other variants of EDS, or marfanoid syndromes. The latter conditions are associated with aortic and cardiac valvular abnormalities. Osteogenesis imperfecta encompasses a group of disorders characterized by bone fragility presenting with a low-impact fracture as a result of minimal trauma. Management includes multidiscipline specialists. Down syndrome (DS), or trisomy 21, is the most common chromosome abnormality identified in live births. Routine evaluation of atlantoaxial instability with x-ray is no longer recommended for children with DS without symptoms of atlantoaxial instability; however, clinical evaluation of symptoms is required for sports preparticipation. Achondroplasia is the most common skeletal dysplasia. Clinical signs are macrocephaly, short limb, short stature with disproportionately shorter humerus and femur, along with characteristic findings in pelvis and lumbar spine x-rays. Caregivers should be educated on proper positioning and handling to avoid complications, including car seat-related deaths.",

Bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective in treating obesity and related comorbidities, but its feasibility and effectiveness in patients with achondroplasia have not been clearly established. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of bariatric surgery in patients with achondroplasia. SETTING: This study was performed in France, and bariatric surgeons from the Societe Francaise et Francophone de Chirurgie de l'Obesite et des Maladies Metaboliques (French Francophone Society of Surgery for Obesity or Metabolic Diseases) were asked to participate. METHODS: Two adult women with confirmed achondroplasia and a high BMI were selected for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. Preoperative data were collected, including demographic information, comorbidities, and follow-up at 1, 3, and 6 months and 1 year after surgery. Complications were monitored and recorded. RESULTS: Both patients had good excess weight loss outcomes, with an average excess weight loss of 60.5% 1 year after surgery. One patient had a follow-up of 3 years and an excess weight loss of 44%. The surgery was well-tolerated, and no major complications were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Bariatric surgery is feasible and effective in patients with achondroplasia, with good outcomes for excess weight loss and related comorbidities. These findings suggest that bariatric surgery should be considered a treatment option for patients with achondroplasia and obesity.",

The patient, a 12-year-old boy, had chief complaints of occlusal disturbance and mandibular protrusion. He had been diagnosed with achondroplasia and had growth hormone treatment in his early teenage years. His facial profile was concave with a bulging forehead and a retrognathic maxilla. It was characterized by a skeletal Class III jaw-base relationship with a retropositioned maxilla. At the age of 12 years 9 months, maxillary protraction was initiated with a reverse headgear; for 2 years 6 months, the maxillomandibular growth was controlled. After the growth spurt, at the age of 15 years 6 months, leveling and alignment of both dental arches were started with preadjusted edgewise appliances. After 83 months of multibracket treatment, an acceptable occlusion with a Class I molar relationship and an adequate interincisal relationship was achieved, despite the simultaneous marked vertical growth of the mandible. The resultant occlusion was stable during a 6-year retention period, although considerable forward-downward mandibular growth was observed. Conclusively, our results indicated the necessity of long-term observation in this patient with achondroplasia, especially because of the persistent mandibular growth.",

CLARITY (The Achondroplasia Natural History Study) includes clinical data from achondroplasia patients receiving treatment at four skeletal dysplasia centers in the United States from 1957 to 2018. Data were entered and stored in a Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) database. RESULTS: Information from one thousand three hundred and seventy-four patients with achondroplasia were included in this study. Four hundred and eight (29.7%) patients had at least one orthopedic surgery during their lifetime and 299 (21.8%) patients underwent multiple procedures. 12.7% (n = 175) of patients underwent spine surgery at a mean age at first surgery of 22.4 +- 15.3 years old. The median age was 16.7 years old (0.1-67.4). 21.2% (n = 291) of patients underwent lower extremity surgery at a mean age at first surgery of 9.9 +- 8.3 years old with a median age of 8.2 years (0.2-57.8). The most common spinal procedure was decompression (152 patients underwent 271 laminectomy procedures), while the most common lower extremity procedure was osteotomy (200 patients underwent 434 procedures). Fifty-eight (4.2%) patients had both a spine and lower extremity surgery. Specific risk factors increasing the likelihood of orthopedic surgery included: patients with hydrocephalus requiring shunt placement having higher odds of undergoing spine surgery (OR 1.97, 95% CI 1.14-3.26); patients having a cervicomedullary decompression also had higher odds of undergoing spine surgery (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.30-2.63); and having lower extremity surgery increased the odds of spine surgery (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.45-2.90). CONCLUSIONS: Orthopedic surgery was a common occurrence in achondroplasia with 29.7% of patients undergoing at least one orthopedic procedure. Spine surgery (12.7%) was less common and occurred at a later age than lower extremity surgery (21.2%). Cervicomedullary decompression and hydrocephalus with shunt placement were associated with an increased risk for spine surgery. The results from CLARITY, the largest natural history study of achondroplasia, should aid clinicians in counseling patients and families about orthopedic surgery.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to analyze the long-term results of humeral lengthening in achondroplastic patients and make suggestions on the most appropriate surgical technique to improve patient outcomes. METHODS: Fifty-four humeral lengthening procedures performed in 27 achondroplastic patients were reviewed. Elongations were performed by means of callotasis with unilateral external fixation. Inclusion criteria were: achondroplastic patients under 17 years without prior arm operations and minimum follow-up of 36 months. RESULTS: Fifty humeri in 25 patients (13 men and 12 women), aged between 9 and 17 years, met the inclusion criteria. Mean humeral lengthening was 8.82 cm (range: 5 to 10.5 cm), which represented an elongation of 54.80% (range: 46% to 63%) of the original length. The healing index was 0.91 months (range: 0.72 to 1.4 mo) per centimeter gained. Shoulder and elbow range of motion and stability were preserved in 47 limbs. Noncomplicated cases consistently experienced a significant functional improvement in the performance of activities of daily living such as putting on footwear and personal hygiene. Short-term complications included 11 pin-tract infections, 1 radial nerve neuropraxia, and 1 failure of the regenerated bone formation. None of these complications prevented from completion of treatment. Long-term complications included 2 cases of nonunion, 3 elbow flexion contractures, and 2 cases of psychological dissatisfaction, all of them in 4 patients. Factors associated with long-term complications were intraoperative fragment displacement and distal humeral osteotomy. No fractures of the regenerated bone were identified in the long term. CONCLUSIONS: Callotasis with unilateral external fixation is a reliable and well-tolerated procedure for humeral lengthening in achondroplastic patients, with an acceptable complication rate. Guided fixator placement and a proximal humeral osteotomy are strongly recommended technical tips as they may help prevent complications and improve outcomes.

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to analyze the long-term results of humeral lengthening in achondroplastic patients and make suggestions on the most appropriate surgical technique to improve patient outcomes. METHODS: Fifty-four humeral lengthening procedures performed in 27 achondroplastic patients were reviewed. Elongations were performed by means of callotasis with unilateral external fixation. Inclusion criteria were: achondroplastic patients under 17 years without prior arm operations and minimum follow-up of 36 months. RESULTS: Fifty humeri in 25 patients (13 men and 12 women), aged between 9 and 17 years, met the inclusion criteria. Mean humeral lengthening was 8.82 cm (range: 5 to 10.5 cm), which represented an elongation of 54.80% (range: 46% to 63%) of the original length. The healing index was 0.91 months (range: 0.72 to 1.4 mo) per centimeter gained. Shoulder and elbow range of motion and stability were preserved in 47 limbs. Noncomplicated cases consistently experienced a significant functional improvement in the performance of activities of daily living such as putting on footwear and personal hygiene. Short-term complications included 11 pin-tract infections, 1 radial nerve neuropraxia, and 1 failure of the regenerated bone formation. None of these complications prevented from completion of treatment. Long-term complications included 2 cases of nonunion, 3 elbow flexion contractures, and 2 cases of psychological dissatisfaction, all of them in 4 patients. Factors associated with long-term complications were intraoperative fragment displacement and distal humeral osteotomy. No fractures of the regenerated bone were identified in the long term. CONCLUSIONS: Callotasis with unilateral external fixation is a reliable and well-tolerated procedure for humeral lengthening in achondroplastic patients, with an acceptable complication rate. Guided fixator placement and a proximal humeral osteotomy are strongly recommended technical tips as they may help prevent complications and improve outcomes.

We retrospectively reviewed 26 humeral segments in 17 patients that were lengthened at our department between 1993 and 2011. There were varying aetiologies including achondroplasia, epiphyseal dysplasia, Oilier disease, trauma or infection of the proximal humeral growth-plate, unicameral bone cyst and brachial plexus injury. Mean age at start of surgery was 17.05 years (range : 5-40). The mean lengthening achieved was 8.85 (3-13) cm. Mean lengthening percentage was 353% (range : 10-48). Average healing index was 30.56 days/cm (range : 17.46-4232). There was a significant difference in healing index between achondroplasia patients (28.79 days/cm) compared to others (33.41 days/cm). Minor problems included pin tract infection (14 segments). More important obstacles were temporary elbow flexion contracture (7 segments), premature consolidation (6 segments), radial nerve dysaesthesia (6 segments) and loosening of a Schanz screw (1 segment). Complications included one fracture and one progressive bowing after frame removal. One planned lengthening was not completely achieved. Despite a lot of obstacles, humeral lengthening using an Ilizarov frame provided a reliable method to treat the functional or cosmetic problems of upper limb shortening.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: An increasing number of children with diverse medical conditions are using long-term noninvasive ventilation (NIV). This study examined the impact of demographic, clinical, and technology-related factors on long-term NIV adverse events in a large cohort of children using long-term NIV. METHODS: This was a multicenter retrospective review of all children who initiated long-term NIV in the province of Alberta, Canada, from January 2005 to September 2014, and followed until December 2015. Inclusion criteria were children who had used NIV for 3 months or more and had at least one follow-up visit with the NIV programs. RESULTS: We identified 507 children who initiated NIV at a median age of 7.5 (interquartile range: 8.6) years and 93% of them reported at least one NIV-related adverse event during the initial follow-up visit. Skin injury (20%) and unintentional air leaks (19%) were reported more frequently at the initial visit. Gastrointestinal symptoms, midface hypoplasia, increased drooling, aspiration and pneumothorax were rarely reported (<5%). Younger age and underlying conditions such as Down syndrome, achondroplasia, and Duchenne muscular dystrophy were early predictors of unintentional air leak. Younger age also predicted child sleep disruption in the short term and ongoing parental sleep disruption. Obesity was a risk factor for persistent nasal symptoms. Mask type was not a significant predictor for NIV-related short- or long-term complications. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that NIV-related complications are frequent. Appropriate mask-fitting and headgear adaptation, and a proactive approach to early detection may help to reduce adverse events.",

The most advanced technology for the treatment of deformities and limb shortening is the use of external fixation devices (AVF). Target. To study the stress-strain state of the \"tibia-AVF model with different variants of AVF mounting in conditions of tibia lengthening. Mathematical modeling of tibial osteosynthesis with external fixation devices in children with achondroplasia was carried out. The model of the distal end of the lower limb contained both lower leg bones and bony elements of the foot. Two variants of the AVF imposition were modeled: with the arrangement of all rods in the same plane, and according to the scheme with a V-shaped arrangement of the rods in the proximal tibia. The values of maximum stresses and values of relative deformations in the elements of the models were investigated. Sweat is a compressive load, the zone of maximum stress (66.8 MPa) in the bone tissue occurs around the upper rod. The smallest stresses (22.8 MPa) are observed around the fourth bar. On the second and third rods, the stresses are the same - 41.6 and 41.5 MPa, respectively. The V-shaped arrangement of the rods leads to a decrease in stresses around the first rod to 57.2 MPa. The stresses in the distal part of the proximal tibia fragment do not exceed 35.5 MPa. Under torsional loads in the model with parallel arrangement of rods, the zone of maximum stresses arises around the first rod (16.3 MPa). The stresses in the distal fragment of the tibia are determined in the range from 1.2 to 3.9 MPa on the lower and upper rods, respectively. The use of an AVF with a V-shaped arrangement of the rods causes stresses in the tibia at a level of 13.1 MPa on the first rod, a minimum 1.1 MPa on the fourth. When the model is compressed with a parallel arrangement of the AVF rods, the values of relative deformations in the bone regenerate are determined in the range from 62 to 85%. The use of the AVF according to the scheme with a V-shaped arrangement of the rods makes it possible to reduce the magnitude of the relative deformations to the level of 77%. In the model with a parallel arrangement of the AVF rods, the relative deformations in the bone regenerate under torsional loads are determined in the range from 3.0 to 6.0%. When using AVF with a V-shaped arrangement of rods, the level of relative deformations is determined in the range from 1.0 to 4.0%. The use of an AVF with a V-shaped arrangement of rods in the lower part of the proximal fragment of the tibia during its osteosynthesis allows reducing the level of stresses at all control points of the model for all types of loading, as compared to the model of an AVF with a parallel arrangement of rods. AVF with a V-shaped arrangement of the rods makes it possible to reduce the values of the relative deformations of the bone regenerate at all the studied control points of the models, both under compression and torsion loads.",

To study the stress-strain state of the \"tibia-AVF model with different variants of AVF mounting in conditions of tibia lengthening. Mathematical modeling of tibial osteosynthesis with external fixation devices in children with achondroplasia was carried out. The model of the distal end of the lower limb contained both lower leg bones and bony elements of the foot. Two variants of the AVF imposition were modeled: with the arrangement of all rods in the same plane, and according to the scheme with a V-shaped arrangement of the rods in the proximal tibia. The values of maximum stresses and values of relative deformations in the elements of the models were investigated. Sweat is a compressive load, the zone of maximum stress (66.8 MPa) in the bone tissue occurs around the upper rod. The smallest stresses (22.8 MPa) are observed around the fourth bar. On the second and third rods, the stresses are the same - 41.6 and 41.5 MPa, respectively. The V-shaped arrangement of the rods leads to a decrease in stresses around the first rod to 57.2 MPa. The stresses in the distal part of the proximal tibia fragment do not exceed 35.5 MPa. Under torsional loads in the model with parallel arrangement of rods, the zone of maximum stresses arises around the first rod (16.3 MPa). The stresses in the distal fragment of the tibia are determined in the range from 1.2 to 3.9 MPa on the lower and upper rods, respectively. The use of an AVF with a V-shaped arrangement of the rods causes stresses in the tibia at a level of 13.1 MPa on the first rod, a minimum 1.1 MPa on the fourth. When the model is compressed with a parallel arrangement of the AVF rods, the values of relative deformations in the bone regenerate are determined in the range from 62 to 85%. The use of the AVF according to the scheme with a V-shaped arrangement of the rods makes it possible to reduce the magnitude of the relative deformations to the level of 77%. In the model with a parallel arrangement of the AVF rods, the relative deformations in the bone regenerate under torsional loads are determined in the range from 3.0 to 6.0%. When using AVF with a V-shaped arrangement of rods, the level of relative deformations is determined in the range from 1.0 to 4.0%. The use of an AVF with a V-shaped arrangement of rods in the lower part of the proximal fragment of the tibia during its osteosynthesis allows reducing the level of stresses at all control points of the model for all types of loading, as compared to the model of an AVF with a parallel arrangement of rods. AVF with a V-shaped arrangement of the rods makes it possible to reduce the values of the relative deformations of the bone regenerate at all the studied control points of the models, both under compression and torsion loads.",

The patient, a 12-year-old boy, had chief complaints of occlusal disturbance and mandibular protrusion. He had been diagnosed with achondroplasia and had growth hormone treatment in his early teenage years. His facial profile was concave with a bulging forehead and a retrognathic maxilla. It was characterized by a skeletal Class III jaw-base relationship with a retropositioned maxilla. At the age of 12 years 9 months, maxillary protraction was initiated with a reverse headgear; for 2 years 6 months, the maxillomandibular growth was controlled. After the growth spurt, at the age of 15 years 6 months, leveling and alignment of both dental arches were started with preadjusted edgewise appliances. After 83 months of multibracket treatment, an acceptable occlusion with a Class I molar relationship and an adequate interincisal relationship was achieved, despite the simultaneous marked vertical growth of the mandible. The resultant occlusion was stable during a 6-year retention period, although considerable forward-downward mandibular growth was observed. Conclusively, our results indicated the necessity of long-term observation in this patient with achondroplasia, especially because of the persistent mandibular growth.",

It is characterized by bone growth abnormalities that are well characterized and by a strong predisposition to abdominal obesity for which causes are unknown. Despite having aroused interest at the end of the 20 h century, there are still only very little data available on this aspect of the pathology. Today, interest is rising again, and some studies are now proposing mechanistic hypotheses and guidance for patient management. These data confirm that obesity is a major health problem in achondroplasia necessitating an early yet complex clinical management. Anticipatory care should be directed at identifying children who are at high risk to develop obesity and intervening to prevent the metabolic complications in adults.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Surgery to achieve long bone lengthening and deformity correction in skeletally immature patients is traditionally performed through external fixators. The incidence of infection during treatment is high. Hydrotherapy is highly beneficial during external fixation management, but the infection rates may impact its utilization. The objective of this paper is to document the incidence and duration of infection in patients who participated in a full hydrotherapy program when performed under medical supervision and in accordance with strict follow-up protocols. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we documented the key characteristics of patients who participated in hydrotherapy after lower limb external fixation surgery including age, sex, diagnosis and surgery site, the incidence and duration of pin site infections, and the percentage of cases, which were able to comply with a full hydrotherapy protocol. RESULTS: The hydrotherapy pool met all daily water quality metrics. Thirty-four children (19 males and 15 females) had a mean+-SD age of 10.9+-4.6 years. Of the cases, 80% were unilateral and 20% were bilateral. Diagnoses included congenital hereditary (eg, achondroplasia), congenital nonhereditary conditions (eg, fibular hemimelia), and acquired conditions (eg, traumatic). The location of osteotomy site was quite evenly spread between the femur and the tibia/fibula. Three out of the 34 patients were unable to receive hydrotherapy due to continuous secretions; 2 patients did not miss any sessions. The mean number of treatments was 3 per week. During the entire period, a total of 1200 treatments were performed for these patients with only 32 cancellations (about 3%) due to secretions or other signs of infection. Spearman correlation coefficients showed significantly high correlations between the duration of external fixation and the duration of hydrotherapy. There are no significant correlations between infections and other factors (sex, age segment, whether the problem is unilateral or /bilateral, diagnosis, and duration of treatment). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report, to our knowledge, that documents the low prevalence of infectious events during hydrotherapy treatment and demonstrates its feasibility. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III; retrospective, comparative study.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Achondroplasia is a genetic disorder that inhibits endochondral ossification, resulting in disproportionate short stature and clinically significant medical complications. Vosoritide is a biologic analogue of C-type natriuretic peptide, a potent stimulator of endochondral ossification. METHODS: In a multinational, phase 2, dose-finding study and extension study, we evaluated the safety and side-effect profile of vosoritide in children (5 to 14 years of age) with achondroplasia. A total of 35 children were enrolled in four sequential cohorts to receive vosoritide at a once-daily subcutaneous dose of 2.5 mug per kilogram of body weight (8 patients in cohort 1), 7.5 mug per kilogram (8 patients in cohort 2), 15.0 mug per kilogram (10 patients in cohort 3), or 30.0 mug per kilogram (9 patients in cohort 4). After 6 months, the dose in cohort 1 was increased to 7.5 mug per kilogram and then to 15.0 mug per kilogram, and in cohort 2, the dose was increased to 15.0 mug per kilogram; the patients in cohorts 3 and 4 continued to receive their initial doses. At the time of data cutoff, the 24-month dose-finding study had been completed, and 30 patients had been enrolled in an ongoing long-term extension study; the median duration of follow-up across both studies was 42 months. RESULTS: During the treatment periods in the dose-finding and extension studies, adverse events occurred in 35 of 35 patients (100%), and serious adverse events occurred in 4 of 35 patients (11%). Therapy was discontinued in 6 patients (in 1 because of an adverse event). During the first 6 months of treatment, a dose-dependent increase in the annualized growth velocity was observed with vosoritide up to a dose of 15.0 mug per kilogram, and a sustained increase in the annualized growth velocity was observed at doses of 15.0 and 30.0 mug per kilogram for up to 42 months. CONCLUSIONS: In children with achondroplasia, once-daily subcutaneous administration of vosoritide was associated with a side-effect profile that appeared generally mild. Treatment resulted in a sustained increase in the annualized growth velocity for up to 42 months.

We performed in-situ injections of bone marrow-derived stem cell concentrates. Patients underwent monthly clinical and radiographic assessment for determination of the healing rate. All eight patients showed an improvement in the regenerated bone, with an average healing index of 23.1 days/cm (range: 18.7-23.8 days/cm). The complete recovery of the delayed consolidation took on an average of 5.2 months (range: 2-10 months). The use of cellular therapy in these patients could represent an innovative application.",

The patient, a 12-year-old boy, had chief complaints of occlusal disturbance and mandibular protrusion. He had been diagnosed with achondroplasia and had growth hormone treatment in his early teenage years. His facial profile was concave with a bulging forehead and a retrognathic maxilla. It was characterized by a skeletal Class III jaw-base relationship with a retropositioned maxilla. At the age of 12 years 9 months, maxillary protraction was initiated with a reverse headgear; for 2 years 6 months, the maxillomandibular growth was controlled. After the growth spurt, at the age of 15 years 6 months, leveling and alignment of both dental arches were started with preadjusted edgewise appliances. After 83 months of multibracket treatment, an acceptable occlusion with a Class I molar relationship and an adequate interincisal relationship was achieved, despite the simultaneous marked vertical growth of the mandible. The resultant occlusion was stable during a 6-year retention period, although considerable forward-downward mandibular growth was observed. Conclusively, our results indicated the necessity of long-term observation in this patient with achondroplasia, especially because of the persistent mandibular growth.",

                    "abstract": "Achondroplasia is a lifelong condition requiring lifelong management. There is consensus that infants and children with achondroplasia should be managed by a multidisciplinary team experienced in the condition. However, many people are lost to follow-up after the transition from paediatric to adult care, and there is no standardised approach for management in adults, despite the recent availability of international consensus guidelines. To address this, the European Achondroplasia Forum has developed a patient-held checklist to support adults with achondroplasia in managing their health. The checklist highlights key symptoms of spinal stenosis and obstructive sleep apnoea, both among the most frequent and potentially severe medical complications in adults with achondroplasia. The checklist acts as a framework to support individuals and their primary care provider in completing a routine review. General advice on issues such as blood pressure, pain, hearing, weight, adaptive aids, and psychosocial aspects are also included. The checklist provides key symptoms to be aware of, in addition to action points so that people can approach their primary care provider and be directed to the appropriate specialist, if needed. Additionally, the European Achondroplasia Forum offers some ideas on implementing the checklist during the transition from paediatric to adult care, thus ensuring the existing multidisciplinary team model in place during childhood can support in engaging individuals and empowering them to take responsibility for their own care as they move into adulthood.",

                    "abstract": "Achondroplasia is a lifelong condition requiring lifelong management. There is consensus that infants and children with achondroplasia should be managed by a multidisciplinary team experienced in the condition. However, many people are lost to follow-up after the transition from paediatric to adult care, and there is no standardised approach for management in adults, despite the recent availability of international consensus guidelines. To address this, the European Achondroplasia Forum has developed a patient-held checklist to support adults with achondroplasia in managing their health. The checklist highlights key symptoms of spinal stenosis and obstructive sleep apnoea, both among the most frequent and potentially severe medical complications in adults with achondroplasia. The checklist acts as a framework to support individuals and their primary care provider in completing a routine review. General advice on issues such as blood pressure, pain, hearing, weight, adaptive aids, and psychosocial aspects are also included. The checklist provides key symptoms to be aware of, in addition to action points so that people can approach their primary care provider and be directed to the appropriate specialist, if needed. Additionally, the European Achondroplasia Forum offers some ideas on implementing the checklist during the transition from paediatric to adult care, thus ensuring the existing multidisciplinary team model in place during childhood can support in engaging individuals and empowering them to take responsibility for their own care as they move into adulthood.",

Glucocorticoids and physical therapy are the mainstay of treatment. Exercise intolerance is the hallmark of metabolic myopathies, which require a combination of laboratory testing, electrodiagnostic testing, and muscle biopsy for diagnosis. Joint hypermobility may be an isolated finding or be associated with hypermobility Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), other variants of EDS, or marfanoid syndromes. The latter conditions are associated with aortic and cardiac valvular abnormalities. Osteogenesis imperfecta encompasses a group of disorders characterized by bone fragility presenting with a low-impact fracture as a result of minimal trauma. Management includes multidiscipline specialists. Down syndrome (DS), or trisomy 21, is the most common chromosome abnormality identified in live births. Routine evaluation of atlantoaxial instability with x-ray is no longer recommended for children with DS without symptoms of atlantoaxial instability; however, clinical evaluation of symptoms is required for sports preparticipation. Achondroplasia is the most common skeletal dysplasia. Clinical signs are macrocephaly, short limb, short stature with disproportionately shorter humerus and femur, along with characteristic findings in pelvis and lumbar spine x-rays. Caregivers should be educated on proper positioning and handling to avoid complications, including car seat-related deaths.",

The feasibility of the physical fitness tests and IPAQ was explored. Forty-three adults (22 women) participated. Mean age was 38 years (range 16-69 years). Mean differences (95% CI) for men and women with ACH compared to reference values were: VO2 peak. -7.0 m/min/kg (-13.6 to -0.5, p = .037), and - 7.9 ml/kg/min (-11.6 to -4.3, p < .001); 6MWT -270.8 m (-340.4 to -201.2, p < .001), and - 196.7 m (-244.3 to -149.0, p = .001); 30sSTS -4.6 repetitions (-7.8 to -1.5, p = .006), and - 1.1 repetitions (-3.4 to 1.1, p = .335). There were no differences within ACH participants, except for VO2 peak, where men performed better. Sufficient physical activity (> 600 metabolic equivalent of task weekly) was achieved by 79% of the participants. The feasibility of the 6MWT and 30sSTS was good. There was a strong correlation between the VO2 peak and 6MWT (men: r = 0.63, p = .007; women: r = 0.71, p < .001). The findings indicate that the 6MWT and 30sSTS test are useful in assessing functional exercise capacity and muscle strength in adults with ACH.",

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective single-center study of 642 consecutive pregnancies in women with preexisting diabetes who gave birth to a singleton >=22 weeks. Weekly planned NSTs were commenced at 33-35 weeks. In pregnancies with maternal-fetal complications, the initiation and frequency of the planned NST were individualized. Daily maternal assessment of fetal activity was recommended from 28 weeks, and decreased fetal activity indicated an unplanned NST. Data were collected from medical records, and local and regional databases. RESULTS: In total, 3016 planned NSTs were performed, with a median of five (range 0-12) tests per pregnancy. Ninety-five planned NSTs (3.1%) were abnormal, a finding confirmed by retesting the same day in eight cases (8.4%), thus leading to delivery. Complications were present in seven of these eight pregnancies, whereas no fetal movements for the last 3 days were reported when the planned NST was performed in the eighth pregnancy. When specifically asked, five of the eight women stated that they had observed decreased fetal activity preceding the planned NST. In 86 pregnancies (13.4%), maternal perception of decreased fetal activity indicated in total 127 unplanned NSTs. The combination of decreased fetal activity and further obstetrical assessment led to delivery in 10 of these pregnancies (11.6%). One stillbirth occurred at 37 weeks in a pregnancy complicated by fetal achondroplasia and polyhydramnios, where the weekly planned NSTs had been normal. The overall stillbirth rate was thus 1.6/1000. CONCLUSIONS: Routine use of planned antenatal NSTs does not appear to be indicated in pregnancies in women with preexisting diabetes in the absence of maternal-fetal complications.",

                    "abstract": "Achondroplasia causes narrowing of the foramen magnum and the spinal canal leading to increased mortality due to cervicomedullary compression in infants and significant morbidity due to spinal stenosis later in adulthood. Vosoritide is a C-natriuretic peptide analogue that has been shown to improve endochondral ossification in children with achondroplasia. The objective of this trial is to evaluate the safety of vosoritide and whether vosoritide can improve the growth of the foramen magnum and spinal canal in children that may require decompression surgery. An Achondroplasia Foramen Magnum Score will be used to identify infants at risk of requiring decompression surgery. This is a 2-year open label randomized controlled trial of vosoritide in infants with achondroplasia ages 0 to <=12 months. Approximately 20 infants will be randomized 1:1 to either open label once daily subcutaneous vosoritide combined with standard of care or standard of care alone. The primary and secondary aims of the study are to evaluate the safety and efficacy of vosoritide in children with cervicomedullary compression at risk of requiring decompression surgery. The trial will be carried out in specialized skeletal dysplasia treatment centers with well established multidisciplinary care pathways and standardized approaches to the neurosurgical management of cervicomedually compression. After 2 years, infants randomized to standard of care alone will be eligible to switch to vosoritide plus standard of care for an additional 3 years. This pioneering trial hopes to address the important question as to whether treatment with vosoritide at an early age in infants at risk of requiring cervicomedullary decompression surgery is safe, and can improve growth at the foramen magnum and spinal canal alleviating stenosis. This in turn may reduce compression of surrounding structures including the neuraxis and spinal cord, which could alleviate future morbidity and mortality.Trial registrations: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04554940; EudraCT number, 2020-001055-40.",

Methods: The clinical data of 38 patients with lower limb deformity caused by achondroplasia treated by Ilizarov technique between February 2014 and September 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. There were 18 males and 20 females, the age ranged from 7 to 34 years, with an average of 14.8 years. All patients presented with bilateral knee varus deformity. The preoperative varus angles was (15.2+-4.2) , and knee society score (KSS) was 61.8+-7.2. Nine of these patients underwent tibia and fibula osteotomy, 29 cases underwent tibia and fibula osteotomy and bone lengthening at the same time. Full-length bearing position X-ray films of bilateral lower limbs were taken to measure the bilateral varus angles, analyze the healing index, and record the occurrence of complications. KSS score was used to evaluate the improvement of knee joint function before and after operation. Results: All 38 cases were followed up 9-65 months, with an average of 26.3 months. Needle tract infection occurred in 4 cases and needle tract loosening occurred in 2 cases after operation, which were improved after symptomatic treatment such as dressing change, Kirschner wire change, and oral antibiotics, and no neurovascular injury occurred in all patients. The external fixator was worn for 3-11 months after operation, with an average of 7.6 months, and the healing index was 43-59 d/cm, with an average of 50.3 d/cm. At last follow-up, the leg was 3-10 cm longer, with an average of 5.5 cm. The varus angles was (1.5+-0.2)  and the KSS score was 93.7+-2.6, which significantly improved when compared with those before operation ( P<0.05). Conclusion: Ilizarov technique is a safe and effective method for the treatment of short limb with genu varus deformity caused by achondroplasia, which can improve the quality of life of patients.",

CLARITY (The Achondroplasia Natural History Study) includes clinical data from achondroplasia patients receiving treatment at four skeletal dysplasia centers in the United States from 1957 to 2018. Data were entered and stored in a Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) database. RESULTS: Information from one thousand three hundred and seventy-four patients with achondroplasia were included in this study. Four hundred and eight (29.7%) patients had at least one orthopedic surgery during their lifetime and 299 (21.8%) patients underwent multiple procedures. 12.7% (n = 175) of patients underwent spine surgery at a mean age at first surgery of 22.4 +- 15.3 years old. The median age was 16.7 years old (0.1-67.4). 21.2% (n = 291) of patients underwent lower extremity surgery at a mean age at first surgery of 9.9 +- 8.3 years old with a median age of 8.2 years (0.2-57.8). The most common spinal procedure was decompression (152 patients underwent 271 laminectomy procedures), while the most common lower extremity procedure was osteotomy (200 patients underwent 434 procedures). Fifty-eight (4.2%) patients had both a spine and lower extremity surgery. Specific risk factors increasing the likelihood of orthopedic surgery included: patients with hydrocephalus requiring shunt placement having higher odds of undergoing spine surgery (OR 1.97, 95% CI 1.14-3.26); patients having a cervicomedullary decompression also had higher odds of undergoing spine surgery (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.30-2.63); and having lower extremity surgery increased the odds of spine surgery (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.45-2.90). CONCLUSIONS: Orthopedic surgery was a common occurrence in achondroplasia with 29.7% of patients undergoing at least one orthopedic procedure. Spine surgery (12.7%) was less common and occurred at a later age than lower extremity surgery (21.2%). Cervicomedullary decompression and hydrocephalus with shunt placement were associated with an increased risk for spine surgery. The results from CLARITY, the largest natural history study of achondroplasia, should aid clinicians in counseling patients and families about orthopedic surgery.",

Due to a shortage of hospital beds and economic constraints, we started a program for outpatient initiation of CPAP in selected children with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). METHODS: Objective CPAP compliance and efficacy were evaluated in consecutive children enrolled in an outpatient CPAP program when they fulfilled the following criteria: persistent OSA, age >6 months, stable condition, family living in the Parisian area and agreeing with a regular follow-up. RESULTS: Thirty-one children, median (range) age 8.9 years (0.8-17.5), were included in the program. The most common diagnosis were Down syndrome (n = 7), achondroplasia (n = 3), and obesity (n = 3). Median baseline obstructive apnea-hypopnea index (OAHI) was 12.5 events/h (5-100). Median duration of follow-up was 12.3 months (2.2-25.2). Four subjects (three adolescents with Down syndrome) were not compliant at 2-month follow-up with a compliance <4 h/night. In the other 27 subjects, median compliance was 08:21 h:min/night (05:45-12:20), with a median number of night use per month of 25 (18-30). CPAP efficacy at the end of follow-up was excellent in the compliant subjects with a median AHI of two events/h (0-4) and normal gas exchange with CPAP therapy. Three subjects were successfully weaned from CPAP treatment during the study period. CONCLUSION: Initiating CPAP in an outpatient setting in children is feasible and effective in selected subjects. A high rate of compliance can be achieved as well as a correction of OSA.",

                    "abstract": "The main problem in the treatment of axial deformities and limb shortening in pediatric orthopedics is the presence of incomplete growth of the patient, which gives an unfavorable basis for the achieved correction. The most advanced technology for the treatment of deformities and limb shortening is the use of external fixation devices (AVF). Target. To study the stress-strain state of the \"tibia-AVF model with different variants of AVF mounting in conditions of tibia lengthening. Mathematical modeling of tibial osteosynthesis with external fixation devices in children with achondroplasia was carried out. The model of the distal end of the lower limb contained both lower leg bones and bony elements of the foot. Two variants of the AVF imposition were modeled: with the arrangement of all rods in the same plane, and according to the scheme with a V-shaped arrangement of the rods in the proximal tibia. The values of maximum stresses and values of relative deformations in the elements of the models were investigated. Sweat is a compressive load, the zone of maximum stress (66.8 MPa) in the bone tissue occurs around the upper rod. The smallest stresses (22.8 MPa) are observed around the fourth bar. On the second and third rods, the stresses are the same - 41.6 and 41.5 MPa, respectively. The V-shaped arrangement of the rods leads to a decrease in stresses around the first rod to 57.2 MPa. The stresses in the distal part of the proximal tibia fragment do not exceed 35.5 MPa. Under torsional loads in the model with parallel arrangement of rods, the zone of maximum stresses arises around the first rod (16.3 MPa). The stresses in the distal fragment of the tibia are determined in the range from 1.2 to 3.9 MPa on the lower and upper rods, respectively. The use of an AVF with a V-shaped arrangement of the rods causes stresses in the tibia at a level of 13.1 MPa on the first rod, a minimum 1.1 MPa on the fourth. When the model is compressed with a parallel arrangement of the AVF rods, the values of relative deformations in the bone regenerate are determined in the range from 62 to 85%. The use of the AVF according to the scheme with a V-shaped arrangement of the rods makes it possible to reduce the magnitude of the relative deformations to the level of 77%. In the model with a parallel arrangement of the AVF rods, the relative deformations in the bone regenerate under torsional loads are determined in the range from 3.0 to 6.0%. When using AVF with a V-shaped arrangement of rods, the level of relative deformations is determined in the range from 1.0 to 4.0%. The use of an AVF with a V-shaped arrangement of rods in the lower part of the proximal fragment of the tibia during its osteosynthesis allows reducing the level of stresses at all control points of the model for all types of loading, as compared to the model of an AVF with a parallel arrangement of rods. AVF with a V-shaped arrangement of the rods makes it possible to reduce the values of the relative deformations of the bone regenerate at all the studied control points of the models, both under compression and torsion loads.",

The challenges encountered during surgical procedures and perioperative care for achondroplastic individuals, are underrepresented in the existing literature. CASE PRESENTATION: In this report, the management of a 26-year-old North-African achondroplastic male is highlighted. The patient suffered a complete intra-articular distal femur fracture (AO/OTA 33-C1) and an ipsilateral patella fracture (AO/OTA 34-C1). The patient's unusual anatomical variations and the lack of suitable orthopedic implants posed significant surgical challenges, particularly in the context of a resource-limited developing country. Facial and spinal deformities, which are common in patients with achondroplasia, further complicated the anesthetic approach. CONCLUSIONS: The limited information on operative management of fractures in achondroplastic patients necessitated independent decision-making and diverging from the convenient approach where clear guidance is available in the literature.",

This phase 1 trial was initiated to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics (PD) and pharmacokinetics (PK) of TransCon CNP. METHODS: This randomized, placebo-controlled, single-ascending dose phase 1 trial was performed at two sites in Australia and enrolled 45 healthy adult males. Subjects received placebo or TransCon CNP (single-ascending dose cohorts [3, 10, 25, 75 or 150 mug CNP/kg]). The primary endpoint was frequency of adverse events and other safety outcomes. Other endpoints included PK and PD measured by cyclic guanosine-monophosphate (cGMP) and amino-terminal propeptide of CNP (NTproCNP). RESULTS: TransCon CNP provided continuous systemic exposure to CNP over at least 7 days post-dose. Plasma and urine levels of cGMP were significantly increased in subjects administered TransCon CNP at 75-150 mug CNP/kg, indicating target engagement of active CNP at the natriuretic peptide receptor-B (NPR-B) for at least 1 week post-dose. TransCon CNP was well-tolerated, with no serious treatment-emergent adverse events or discontinuations. Extensive cardiac safety assessments did not reveal any clinically relevant effects on electrocardiogram parameters, including heart rate, PR, QRS and QTcF intervals. CONCLUSIONS: Safety and PD data from this phase 1 trial support that TransCon CNP is well tolerated, with a PK profile compatible with a once-weekly dosing regimen. Further studies are ongoing to evaluate the potential of TransCon CNP to positively impact abnormal endochondral ossification in children with achondroplasia.",

We identified that meclizine hydrochloride inhibited FGFR3 signaling in various chondrocytic cells and promoted longitudinal bone growth in mouse model of ACH. Meclizine has safely been used for more than 50 years, but it lacks the safety data for repeated administration and pharmacokinetics (PK) when administered to children. We performed a phase Ia study to evaluate the PK and safety of meclizine administered orally to ACH children. Twelve ACH children aged from 5 to younger than 11 years were recruited, and the first 6 subjects received once a day of meclizine in the fasted condition, subsequent 6 subjects received twice a day of meclizine in the fed condition. Meclizine was well tolerated in ACH children with no serious adverse events. The mean Cmax, Tmax, AUC0-24h, t1/2 during 24 hours in the fasted condition were 130 ng/mL, 1.7 hours, 761 ng h/mL, and 8.5 hours respectively. The simulation of repeated administration of meclizine for 14 days demonstrated that plasma concentration apparently reached steady state around 10 days after the first dose both at once a day and twice a day administration. The AUC0-10h of the fasting and fed condition were 504 ng h/mL and 813 ng h/mL, respectively, indicating exposure of meclizine increased with the diet. Although higher drug exposure was confirmed in ACH children compared to adults, a single administration of meclizine seemed to be well tolerated.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Automated bladder scanning has become a principal tool in the assessment and management of chronically debilitated patients residing in skilled nursing facilities, hospices, and acute inpatient settings. To a large extent, the bladder scan, generally performed by nursing staff, has replaced physical examination while addressing the differential diagnoses of anuria or voiding disturbances that require consideration of urinary catheterization. Health care providers can quickly master this easily performed technique, and currently, due to confidence in the bladder scan finding, physical examination with suprapubic palpation and percussion may be carelessly omitted. The case description presented here illustrates how not performing a physical examination can lead to misdiagnosis caused by misinterpretation of bladder scan findings. CASE REPORT A 66-year-old, quadriparetic, chronically ventilated female patient with achondroplasia underwent repeated hospital referrals and bladder catheterizations for presumed flaccid, neurogenic bladder with urinary retention. This postulated diagnosis was based on occasional reports of urinary catheter obstruction as well as on automated bladder scanning indicating a markedly distended bladder. However, the bladder could not be drained by insertion of urinary catheters. Eventually, a proper physical examination excluded the presence of suprapubic fullness compatible with distended bladder and contradicting bladder scan findings, prompting re-examining an overlooked evaluation of computed tomography that reported a huge ovarian cyst. The patient was found to have intact voiding capabilities and is now weaned from the catheter. CONCLUSIONS This case and the literature review underscore drawbacks in automated bladder scanning. This technique should be used as an adjunctive measure rather than a replacement for a physical examination in the evaluation of voiding disturbances, especially when there are discrepancies between bladder scan findings and the volume of urine drained by catheterization.",

Exercise intolerance is the hallmark of metabolic myopathies, which require a combination of laboratory testing, electrodiagnostic testing, and muscle biopsy for diagnosis. Joint hypermobility may be an isolated finding or be associated with hypermobility Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), other variants of EDS, or marfanoid syndromes. The latter conditions are associated with aortic and cardiac valvular abnormalities. Osteogenesis imperfecta encompasses a group of disorders characterized by bone fragility presenting with a low-impact fracture as a result of minimal trauma. Management includes multidiscipline specialists. Down syndrome (DS), or trisomy 21, is the most common chromosome abnormality identified in live births. Routine evaluation of atlantoaxial instability with x-ray is no longer recommended for children with DS without symptoms of atlantoaxial instability; however, clinical evaluation of symptoms is required for sports preparticipation. Achondroplasia is the most common skeletal dysplasia. Clinical signs are macrocephaly, short limb, short stature with disproportionately shorter humerus and femur, along with characteristic findings in pelvis and lumbar spine x-rays.

Difficulties encountered with ventilation through the cuffed tracheostomy tube in the prone position necessitated aborting the case. During three subsequent surgeries, the tracheostomy tube was removed and an armored endotracheal tube was placed through the tracheostomy stoma prior to prone positioning. No further difficulties with ventilation were noted with the subsequent cases. There are currently no guidelines in the medical literature regarding perioperative management of patients with a tracheostomy requiring prone positioning for surgery.

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to analyze the long-term results of humeral lengthening in achondroplastic patients and make suggestions on the most appropriate surgical technique to improve patient outcomes. METHODS: Fifty-four humeral lengthening procedures performed in 27 achondroplastic patients were reviewed. Elongations were performed by means of callotasis with unilateral external fixation. Inclusion criteria were: achondroplastic patients under 17 years without prior arm operations and minimum follow-up of 36 months. RESULTS: Fifty humeri in 25 patients (13 men and 12 women), aged between 9 and 17 years, met the inclusion criteria. Mean humeral lengthening was 8.82 cm (range: 5 to 10.5 cm), which represented an elongation of 54.80% (range: 46% to 63%) of the original length. The healing index was 0.91 months (range: 0.72 to 1.4 mo) per centimeter gained. Shoulder and elbow range of motion and stability were preserved in 47 limbs. Noncomplicated cases consistently experienced a significant functional improvement in the performance of activities of daily living such as putting on footwear and personal hygiene. Short-term complications included 11 pin-tract infections, 1 radial nerve neuropraxia, and 1 failure of the regenerated bone formation. None of these complications prevented from completion of treatment. Long-term complications included 2 cases of nonunion, 3 elbow flexion contractures, and 2 cases of psychological dissatisfaction, all of them in 4 patients. Factors associated with long-term complications were intraoperative fragment displacement and distal humeral osteotomy. No fractures of the regenerated bone were identified in the long term. CONCLUSIONS: Callotasis with unilateral external fixation is a reliable and well-tolerated procedure for humeral lengthening in achondroplastic patients, with an acceptable complication rate. Guided fixator placement and a proximal humeral osteotomy are strongly recommended technical tips as they may help prevent complications and improve outcomes.

METHODS: In this study 20 patients (50 lower extremity long bones) who underwent PAL or CM were divided into 2 cohort groups. The amount of lengthening, percentage lengthening, external fixator index (EFI), external fixator time, Li regeneration index, complication rate, and knee range of motion (ROM) were compared between the groups. RESULTS: The median age was 9.4 years (range 6-16 years) in the PAL group and 12 years (range 9-16 years) in the CM group (p = 0.01). Males comprised 80% of the patients in the PAL group and 47% of the patients in the CM group (p = 0.02). The median amount of lengthening in the PAL and CM groups was 7.5 cm (range 5.5-9.5 cm) and 6.0 cm (range 5.5-9.0 cm), respectively (p < 0.01). The median percentage of lengthening in the PAL and CM groups was 44.6% (range 20.0-70.1%) and 43.0% (range 20.5-57.3%), respectively (p = 0.01). The median external fixator time in the PAL and CM groups was 127 days (range 94-185 days) and 180 days (range 105-355 days), respectively (p < 0.01). The median EFI in the PAL and CM groups was 21 days/cm (range 10-33 days/cm) and 27 days/cm (range 15-59 days/cm), respectively (p < 0.01). The Li regeneration index was 3 (interquartile range, IQR 2-4) in both groups (p = 0.2). The total complication rate was similar between the groups. CONCLUSION: In patients with achondroplasia, after lengthening with an external fixator, internal fixation with a plate can be a reliable alternative to the conventional method.

OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the trends in management and inpatient outcomes in patients with syndromic scoliosis undergoing spinal deformity correction. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Syndromic scoliosis (SS) refers to scoliosis that is most commonly associated with systemic disease including Ehler Danhlos syndrome (EDS), Marfan syndrome (MF), Down syndrome (DS), Achondroplasia (AP), and Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). Limited data exist evaluating hospital outcomes in patients with SS undergoing spinal deformity correction. METHODS: The Kids' Inpatient Database (KIDS) was queried from 2001 to 2012 to identify all pediatric patients with scoliosis undergoing spinal fusion. These patients were then sub-divided into two cohorts: (1) patients with idiopathic scoliosis (IS) and (2) patients with syndromic scoliosis. Trends in surgical management, and postoperative morbidity and mortality were assessed. Length of stay and total hospital charges were additionally analyzed. A sub-analysis to characterize outcomes in each syndrome was also performed. RESULTS: An estimated 1071 patients with SS were identified and compared with 24,989 pediatric patients with IS. MF (36.8%), Down syndrome (16.0%), and PWS (14.9%) were the most common diagnoses among patients with SS. Between 2001 and 2012, there was a significant decline in the number of anterior procedures performed in both cohorts. Conversely, the number of posterior based procedures increased. SS was associated with increased major complications (2.7% compared with 1.0% in IS; P < 0.001) and minor complication rates (41.0% compared with 28.5% in IS; P < 0.001). Patients with AP incurred the highest rate of major complications (10.7%), minor complications (60.8%), and intraoperative durotomies (6.1%). Total hospital charges increased significantly over the 12-year span. CONCLUSION: Trends in management of syndromic scoliosis have paralleled that of idiopathic scoliosis. Syndromic scoliosis is associated with increased risks with surgical deformity correction. Further prospective studies are warranted to evaluate the reasons for these differences.

The purpose of this study was to describe the surgical results of 3 adolescents presenting with neurogenic claudication and posterior vertebral rim fracture when treated with laminectomy alone. METHODS: The medical and operative records of the 3 pediatric patients were retrospectively reviewed. Presenting signs and symptoms and CT findings, such as the interpedicular distances between T-12 and L-5, were obtained. Perioperative results were assessed, including operative time, blood loss, length of hospital stay, and complications. Findings at latest follow-up were also recorded, including a patient satisfaction survey. RESULTS: The 3 patients (1 girl and 2 boys) had a mean age of 14.7 years (range 14-15 years) and underwent follow-up for a mean of 11.3 months (range 5-18 months). Notable preoperative signs and symptoms included back pain (all patients), leg pain (all patients), leg numbness (1 patient), and leg weakness (1 patient). No patient presented with bowel and/or bladder dysfunction. The mean blood loss during laminectomy was 123 ml (range 20-300 ml), and the mean length of hospital stay was 4.3 days (range 3-6 days). On average, decompression was performed at 2.2 levels (range 2-2.5 levels). All 3 patients reported at most recent follow-up that they were \"satisfied\" with the surgery. There was 1 complication of instability from an iatrogenic pars fracture, which required reoperation and posterior instrumented fusion. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this report represents the first surgical series of pediatric neurogenic claudication associated with posterior vertebral rim fractures. Pediatric neurosurgeons may infrequently encounter neurogenic claudication associated with a posterior vertebral rim fracture in children. To treat children with neurogenic claudication associated with posterior vertebral rim fractures, a simple laminectomy may be a safe and efficacious alternative to discectomy and removal of fracture fragments.",

Her first delivery had been performed by C/S under general anesthesia at a regional hospital 6 years before. Preoperative airway assessment showed normal mouth opening and mobile cervical spine. Since she had anxiety about needle puncture and refused neuraxial blockade and since we considered the trachea could be intubated, we decided to perform C/S under general anesthesia at 37 weeks of gestation. The patient and baby had an uneventful perioperative course. Underdevelopment of bone formation results in characteristic craniofacial and vertebral abnormalities in patients with achondroplasia. Anesthetic management of achondroplastic parturients should be specified to individual basis based on careful preoperative assessment of craniofacial and vertebral deformities.",

Skin injury (20%) and unintentional air leaks (19%) were reported more frequently at the initial visit. Gastrointestinal symptoms, midface hypoplasia, increased drooling, aspiration and pneumothorax were rarely reported (<5%). Younger age and underlying conditions such as Down syndrome, achondroplasia, and Duchenne muscular dystrophy were early predictors of unintentional air leak. Younger age also predicted child sleep disruption in the short term and ongoing parental sleep disruption. Obesity was a risk factor for persistent nasal symptoms.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Femoral fracture after femoral lengthening in patients with achondroplasia and hypochondroplasia is a frequent complication, occurring in up to 30%. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the effectiveness of prophylactic intramedullary rodding in preventing this complication. METHODS: Multicenter retrospective study involving 86 femoral lengthening procedures in 43 patients with achondroplasia or hypochondroplasia. Forty-two femora (21 patients) were prophylactically managed with intramedullary Rush rodding after external fixation removal (11 females and 10 males, mean age 14.6 years) compared with 44 femora (22 patients) without prophylactic intramedullary rodding (13 females and 9 males, mean age 15.2 years). The mean amount of lengthening in the rodding group was 13.3 cm (52.6%) with an External Fixation Index of 25.8 days/cm; in patients without rodding was 14.3 cm (61.5%) and 24.5 days/cm, respectively. RESULTS: Seven cases (15.9%) without rodding developed fractures. Four of them required surgical correction due to displacement or shortening. Only 1 patient (2.4%) had fracture of the femur after prophylactic rodding, and surgery was not required. The incidence of femur fracture was significantly lower in the prophylactic rodding group compared with the nonrodding group (2.4% vs. 15.9%, respectively; P =0.034). There were no cases of infection or avascular necrosis. CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic intramedullary rodding is a safe and effective method for preventing femoral fractures after femoral lengthening in patients with achondroplasia or hypochondroplasia.

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to analyze the long-term results of humeral lengthening in achondroplastic patients and make suggestions on the most appropriate surgical technique to improve patient outcomes. METHODS: Fifty-four humeral lengthening procedures performed in 27 achondroplastic patients were reviewed. Elongations were performed by means of callotasis with unilateral external fixation. Inclusion criteria were: achondroplastic patients under 17 years without prior arm operations and minimum follow-up of 36 months. RESULTS: Fifty humeri in 25 patients (13 men and 12 women), aged between 9 and 17 years, met the inclusion criteria. Mean humeral lengthening was 8.82 cm (range: 5 to 10.5 cm), which represented an elongation of 54.80% (range: 46% to 63%) of the original length. The healing index was 0.91 months (range: 0.72 to 1.4 mo) per centimeter gained. Shoulder and elbow range of motion and stability were preserved in 47 limbs. Noncomplicated cases consistently experienced a significant functional improvement in the performance of activities of daily living such as putting on footwear and personal hygiene. Short-term complications included 11 pin-tract infections, 1 radial nerve neuropraxia, and 1 failure of the regenerated bone formation. None of these complications prevented from completion of treatment. Long-term complications included 2 cases of nonunion, 3 elbow flexion contractures, and 2 cases of psychological dissatisfaction, all of them in 4 patients. Factors associated with long-term complications were intraoperative fragment displacement and distal humeral osteotomy. No fractures of the regenerated bone were identified in the long term. CONCLUSIONS: Callotasis with unilateral external fixation is a reliable and well-tolerated procedure for humeral lengthening in achondroplastic patients, with an acceptable complication rate. Guided fixator placement and a proximal humeral osteotomy are strongly recommended technical tips as they may help prevent complications and improve outcomes.

The aim of this study was to show that TFJ transfixion can be avoided with no impact on patient outcome. All achondroplastic patients undergoing tibia lengthening from 1999 to 2018 were included. Patients were divided in two groups: group A (11 patients) submitted to proximal TFJ transfixion and group B (22 patients) not submitted to TFJ transfixion. The results showed a statistically significant difference in proximal fibular migration (PFM) between the two groups of patients, with a mean PFM of 9.2 mm (range, 1-20 mm) and of 21 mm (range, 2.7-76 mm) in group A and in group B, respectively. We can state that PFM up to 41 mm in our series did not affect joint function and stability. There are no statistically significant differences in the other radiological parameters. Analysis of functional scores (Knee Society, Tegner-Lhysolm, Association for the Study and Application of Methods of Ilizarov) did not reveal significant differences between the groups. The scores of the Achondroplasia Personal Life Experience Scale were also similar in the two groups, demonstrating a good quality of life. There are no differences between the two groups in terms of clinical-functional outcome of the knee, radiographic results, and quality of life. Transfixion of proximal TFJ may not be necessary, but it is important to avoid premature consolidation of the fibular osteotomy.",

                    "title": "What Are the Risks and Functional Outcomes Associated With Bilateral Humeral Lengthening Using a Monolateral External Fixator in Patients With Achondroplasia?",
                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Many patients with achondroplasia experience functional impairments because of rhizomelic upper extremities (proximal limb shortening). Bilateral humeral lengthening may overcome these functional limitations, but it is associated with several risks, such as radial nerve palsy and insufficient bone regeneration. Only a few studies have reported on patient satisfaction and functional outcome after humeral lengthening in patients with achondroplasia. Furthermore, the reported numbers of adverse events associated with lengthening procedures using external fixators vary widely. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Does bilateral humeral lengthening with a monolateral external fixator in patients with achondroplasia reliably improve patient function and autonomy, and what proportion of patients achieved at least 8 cm of humeral lengthening? (2) What adverse events occur after bilateral humeral lengthening with monolateral external fixators? METHODS: Between 2011 and 2019, 44 patients underwent humeral lengthening at our institution. Humeral lengthening was performed in patients with severe shortening of the upper extremities and functional impairments. In humeri in which intramedullary devices were not applicable, lengthening was performed with monolateral external fixators in 40 patients. Eight patients were excluded because they underwent unilateral lengthening for etiologies other than achondroplasia, and another four patients did not fulfill the minimum study follow-up period of 2 years, leaving 28 patients with bilateral humeral lengthening to treat achondroplasia available for analysis in this retrospective study. The patients had a median (interquartile range) age of 8 years (8 to 10), and 50% (14 of 28) were girls. The median follow-up time was 6 years (4 to 8). The median humeral lengthening was 9 cm (9 to 10) with a median elongation of 73% (67% to 78%) from an initial median length of 12 cm (11 to 13). To determine whether this treatment reliably improved patient function and autonomy, surgeons retrospectively evaluated patient charts. An unvalidated retrospective patient-reported outcome measure questionnaire consisting of nine items (with answers of \"yes\" or \"no\" or a 5-point Likert scale) was administered to assess the patient's functional improvement in activities of daily living, physical appearance, and overall satisfaction, such that 45 points was the highest possible score. The radiographic outcome was assessed on calibrated radiographs of the humerus. To ascertain the proportion of adverse events, study surgeons performed a chart review and telephone interviews. Major complications were defined as events that resulted in unplanned revision surgery, nerve injury (either temporary or permanent), refracture of the bone regenerate, or permanent functional sequelae. Minor complications were characterized as events that resolved without further surgical interventions. RESULTS: On our unvalidated assessment of patient function and independence, all patients reported improvement at their most recent follow-up compared with scores obtained before treatment (median [IQR] 24 [16 to 28] before surgery versus 44 [42 to 45] at latest follow-up, difference of medians 20 points, p < 0.001). A total of 89% (25 of 28) of patients achieved the desired 8 cm of lengthening in both arms. A total of 50% (14 of 28) of our patients experienced a major complication. Specifically, 39% (11 of 28) had an unplanned reoperation, 39% (11 of 28) had a radial nerve palsy, 18% (5 of 28) had a refracture of the regenerate, and 4% (1 of 28) concluded treatment with a severe limb length discrepancy. In addition, 82% (23 of 28) of our patients experienced minor complications that resolved without further surgery and did not involve radial nerve symptoms. Radial nerve palsy was observed immediately postoperatively in eight of 13 segments, and 1 to 7 days postoperatively in five of 13 segments. The treatment goal was not achieved because of radial nerve palsy in 5% (3 of 56) of lengthened segments, which occurred in 7% (2 of 28) of patients. Full functional recovery of the radial nerve was observed in all patients after a median (IQR) of 3 months (2 to 5). Refractures of bone regenerates were observed in 11% (6 of 56) of humeri in 18% (5 of 28) of patients. Of those refractures, 1 of 6 patients was treated nonsurgically with a hanging cast, while 5 of 6 patients underwent revision surgery with intramedullary rodding. CONCLUSION: Most patients with achondroplasia who underwent humeral lengthening achieved the treatment goal without permanent sequelae; nonetheless, complications of treatment were common, and the road to recovery was long and often complicated, with many patients experiencing problems that were either painful (such as refracture) or bothersome (such as temporary radial nerve palsy). However, using a subjective scale, patients seemed improved after treatment; nevertheless, robust outcomes tools are not available for this condition, and so we must interpret that finding with caution. Considering our discoveries, bilateral humeral lengthening with a monolateral external fixator should only be considered in patients with severe functional impairments because of rhizomelic shortening of the upper extremities. If feasible, internal lengthening devices might be preferable, as these are generally associated with higher patient comfort and decreased complication rates compared with external fixators.

Vosoritide is a C-natriuretic peptide analogue that has been shown to improve endochondral ossification in children with achondroplasia. The objective of this trial is to evaluate the safety of vosoritide and whether vosoritide can improve the growth of the foramen magnum and spinal canal in children that may require decompression surgery. An Achondroplasia Foramen Magnum Score will be used to identify infants at risk of requiring decompression surgery. This is a 2-year open label randomized controlled trial of vosoritide in infants with achondroplasia ages 0 to <=12 months. Approximately 20 infants will be randomized 1:1 to either open label once daily subcutaneous vosoritide combined with standard of care or standard of care alone. The primary and secondary aims of the study are to evaluate the safety and efficacy of vosoritide in children with cervicomedullary compression at risk of requiring decompression surgery. The trial will be carried out in specialized skeletal dysplasia treatment centers with well established multidisciplinary care pathways and standardized approaches to the neurosurgical management of cervicomedually compression. After 2 years, infants randomized to standard of care alone will be eligible to switch to vosoritide plus standard of care for an additional 3 years. This pioneering trial hopes to address the important question as to whether treatment with vosoritide at an early age in infants at risk of requiring cervicomedullary decompression surgery is safe, and can improve growth at the foramen magnum and spinal canal alleviating stenosis. This in turn may reduce compression of surrounding structures including the neuraxis and spinal cord, which could alleviate future morbidity and mortality.Trial registrations: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04554940; EudraCT number, 2020-001055-40.",

Due to a shortage of hospital beds and economic constraints, we started a program for outpatient initiation of CPAP in selected children with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). METHODS: Objective CPAP compliance and efficacy were evaluated in consecutive children enrolled in an outpatient CPAP program when they fulfilled the following criteria: persistent OSA, age >6 months, stable condition, family living in the Parisian area and agreeing with a regular follow-up. RESULTS: Thirty-one children, median (range) age 8.9 years (0.8-17.5), were included in the program. The most common diagnosis were Down syndrome (n = 7), achondroplasia (n = 3), and obesity (n = 3). Median baseline obstructive apnea-hypopnea index (OAHI) was 12.5 events/h (5-100). Median duration of follow-up was 12.3 months (2.2-25.2). Four subjects (three adolescents with Down syndrome) were not compliant at 2-month follow-up with a compliance <4 h/night. In the other 27 subjects, median compliance was 08:21 h:min/night (05:45-12:20), with a median number of night use per month of 25 (18-30). CPAP efficacy at the end of follow-up was excellent in the compliant subjects with a median AHI of two events/h (0-4) and normal gas exchange with CPAP therapy. Three subjects were successfully weaned from CPAP treatment during the study period. CONCLUSION: Initiating CPAP in an outpatient setting in children is feasible and effective in selected subjects. A high rate of compliance can be achieved as well as a correction of OSA.",

Multilevel Ossification of the ligamentum flavum in the spine is a rare occurrence which too can contribute to stenosed canal. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of an Indian achondroplasic dwarf with multilevel ossification of ligamentum flavum (OLF) at thoracic and lumbar segment. She presented in the outpatient department with bilateral weakness in legs with complete foot drop on the left side and was non-ambulatory. She was managed surgically by instrumentation with multiple interbody fusions with wide decompression and excision of OLF. The patient responded well to the surgery and became a walker after 2-year follow-up. DISCUSSION: Achondroplasic patients may present rarely with multiregional and multilevel OLF. It is important to identify them preoperatively so as to have good surgical outcome. Wide laminectomy, removal of the ossified ligament, and fusion with instrumentation resulted in the improvement of the patient's neurological symptoms and functions.",

Due to the need for home mechanical ventilation at night, the patient had a tracheostomy in place. With the first surgical procedure, the cuffed tracheostomy tube was left in place during prone positioning. Difficulties encountered with ventilation through the cuffed tracheostomy tube in the prone position necessitated aborting the case. During three subsequent surgeries, the tracheostomy tube was removed and an armored endotracheal tube was placed through the tracheostomy stoma prior to prone positioning. No further difficulties with ventilation were noted with the subsequent cases. There are currently no guidelines in the medical literature regarding perioperative management of patients with a tracheostomy requiring prone positioning for surgery. The management of such patients is reviewed and possible problems with tracheostomy positioning during prone positioning are explored. Given such issues, we would suggest removal of the tracheostomy tube and placement of an armored endotracheal tube through the stoma during surgical procedures in the prone position.",

This includes the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) filling mechanism that leads to an increase in mode pressure if excess fluid volume exacerbates the obstructive process. Elevation in mode occurs because pressure in the central nervous system (CNS) represents a state of reduced flow, rather than an abnormality of volume. Diseases that cause elevated mode pressure by means of a primary edema can lead to hydrocephalus if there is sufficient time and obstruction to flow for the filling mechanism to act. Hydrocephalus is driven primarily by labile pressure due to restricted compliance, it can expand skeletal compartments and deplete parenchyma volume as it advances. This hypothesis applies existing principles of water balance. It is part of a series of works that propose a spectrum of hydrocephalic disorders including developmental forms such as achondroplasia with other conditions such as functional trapped fourth ventricle, arachnoid cyst, syringomyelia and normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). Links between the conditions can be made by understanding the continuously variable pressure profile local to the cavity that is subject to filling. Fluid lesions of the brain or spine that arise from developmental malformations of the skull have a physiological component. Changes form part of the mechanisms that may compensate the disease process.",

                    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of routine (planned) antenatal nonstress tests (NSTs) in pregnant women with preexisting diabetes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective single-center study of 642 consecutive pregnancies in women with preexisting diabetes who gave birth to a singleton >=22 weeks. Weekly planned NSTs were commenced at 33-35 weeks. In pregnancies with maternal-fetal complications, the initiation and frequency of the planned NST were individualized. Daily maternal assessment of fetal activity was recommended from 28 weeks, and decreased fetal activity indicated an unplanned NST. Data were collected from medical records, and local and regional databases. RESULTS: In total, 3016 planned NSTs were performed, with a median of five (range 0-12) tests per pregnancy. Ninety-five planned NSTs (3.1%) were abnormal, a finding confirmed by retesting the same day in eight cases (8.4%), thus leading to delivery. Complications were present in seven of these eight pregnancies, whereas no fetal movements for the last 3 days were reported when the planned NST was performed in the eighth pregnancy. When specifically asked, five of the eight women stated that they had observed decreased fetal activity preceding the planned NST. In 86 pregnancies (13.4%), maternal perception of decreased fetal activity indicated in total 127 unplanned NSTs. The combination of decreased fetal activity and further obstetrical assessment led to delivery in 10 of these pregnancies (11.6%). One stillbirth occurred at 37 weeks in a pregnancy complicated by fetal achondroplasia and polyhydramnios, where the weekly planned NSTs had been normal. The overall stillbirth rate was thus 1.6/1000. CONCLUSIONS: Routine use of planned antenatal NSTs does not appear to be indicated in pregnancies in women with preexisting diabetes in the absence of maternal-fetal complications.",

There is consensus that infants and children with achondroplasia should be managed by a multidisciplinary team experienced in the condition. However, many people are lost to follow-up after the transition from paediatric to adult care, and there is no standardised approach for management in adults, despite the recent availability of international consensus guidelines. To address this, the European Achondroplasia Forum has developed a patient-held checklist to support adults with achondroplasia in managing their health. The checklist highlights key symptoms of spinal stenosis and obstructive sleep apnoea, both among the most frequent and potentially severe medical complications in adults with achondroplasia. The checklist acts as a framework to support individuals and their primary care provider in completing a routine review. General advice on issues such as blood pressure, pain, hearing, weight, adaptive aids, and psychosocial aspects are also included. The checklist provides key symptoms to be aware of, in addition to action points so that people can approach their primary care provider and be directed to the appropriate specialist, if needed. Additionally, the European Achondroplasia Forum offers some ideas on implementing the checklist during the transition from paediatric to adult care, thus ensuring the existing multidisciplinary team model in place during childhood can support in engaging individuals and empowering them to take responsibility for their own care as they move into adulthood.",

                    "abstract": "AIM: TransCon CNP is a novel prodrug designed to provide sustained release of C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) for once-weekly therapy, addressing the pathology leading to aberrant skeletal development in achondroplasia. This phase 1 trial was initiated to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics (PD) and pharmacokinetics (PK) of TransCon CNP. METHODS: This randomized, placebo-controlled, single-ascending dose phase 1 trial was performed at two sites in Australia and enrolled 45 healthy adult males. Subjects received placebo or TransCon CNP (single-ascending dose cohorts [3, 10, 25, 75 or 150 mug CNP/kg]). The primary endpoint was frequency of adverse events and other safety outcomes. Other endpoints included PK and PD measured by cyclic guanosine-monophosphate (cGMP) and amino-terminal propeptide of CNP (NTproCNP). RESULTS: TransCon CNP provided continuous systemic exposure to CNP over at least 7 days post-dose. Plasma and urine levels of cGMP were significantly increased in subjects administered TransCon CNP at 75-150 mug CNP/kg, indicating target engagement of active CNP at the natriuretic peptide receptor-B (NPR-B) for at least 1 week post-dose. TransCon CNP was well-tolerated, with no serious treatment-emergent adverse events or discontinuations. Extensive cardiac safety assessments did not reveal any clinically relevant effects on electrocardiogram parameters, including heart rate, PR, QRS and QTcF intervals. CONCLUSIONS: Safety and PD data from this phase 1 trial support that TransCon CNP is well tolerated, with a PK profile compatible with a once-weekly dosing regimen. Further studies are ongoing to evaluate the potential of TransCon CNP to positively impact abnormal endochondral ossification in children with achondroplasia.",

Vosoritide is a biologic analogue of C-type natriuretic peptide, a potent stimulator of endochondral ossification. METHODS: In a multinational, phase 2, dose-finding study and extension study, we evaluated the safety and side-effect profile of vosoritide in children (5 to 14 years of age) with achondroplasia. A total of 35 children were enrolled in four sequential cohorts to receive vosoritide at a once-daily subcutaneous dose of 2.5 mug per kilogram of body weight (8 patients in cohort 1), 7.5 mug per kilogram (8 patients in cohort 2), 15.0 mug per kilogram (10 patients in cohort 3), or 30.0 mug per kilogram (9 patients in cohort 4). After 6 months, the dose in cohort 1 was increased to 7.5 mug per kilogram and then to 15.0 mug per kilogram, and in cohort 2, the dose was increased to 15.0 mug per kilogram; the patients in cohorts 3 and 4 continued to receive their initial doses. At the time of data cutoff, the 24-month dose-finding study had been completed, and 30 patients had been enrolled in an ongoing long-term extension study; the median duration of follow-up across both studies was 42 months. RESULTS: During the treatment periods in the dose-finding and extension studies, adverse events occurred in 35 of 35 patients (100%), and serious adverse events occurred in 4 of 35 patients (11%). Therapy was discontinued in 6 patients (in 1 because of an adverse event). During the first 6 months of treatment, a dose-dependent increase in the annualized growth velocity was observed with vosoritide up to a dose of 15.0 mug per kilogram, and a sustained increase in the annualized growth velocity was observed at doses of 15.0 and 30.0 mug per kilogram for up to 42 months. CONCLUSIONS: In children with achondroplasia, once-daily subcutaneous administration of vosoritide was associated with a side-effect profile that appeared generally mild. Treatment resulted in a sustained increase in the annualized growth velocity for up to 42 months.

We identified that meclizine hydrochloride inhibited FGFR3 signaling in various chondrocytic cells and promoted longitudinal bone growth in mouse model of ACH. Meclizine has safely been used for more than 50 years, but it lacks the safety data for repeated administration and pharmacokinetics (PK) when administered to children. We performed a phase Ia study to evaluate the PK and safety of meclizine administered orally to ACH children. Twelve ACH children aged from 5 to younger than 11 years were recruited, and the first 6 subjects received once a day of meclizine in the fasted condition, subsequent 6 subjects received twice a day of meclizine in the fed condition. Meclizine was well tolerated in ACH children with no serious adverse events. The mean Cmax, Tmax, AUC0-24h, t1/2 during 24 hours in the fasted condition were 130 ng/mL, 1.7 hours, 761 ng h/mL, and 8.5 hours respectively. The simulation of repeated administration of meclizine for 14 days demonstrated that plasma concentration apparently reached steady state around 10 days after the first dose both at once a day and twice a day administration. The AUC0-10h of the fasting and fed condition were 504 ng h/mL and 813 ng h/mL, respectively, indicating exposure of meclizine increased with the diet. Although higher drug exposure was confirmed in ACH children compared to adults, a single administration of meclizine seemed to be well tolerated.",

Cases of achondroplasia and screening and surgery claims were identified using a combination of International Classification of Diseases diagnosis codes and Current Procedural Terminology codes. American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) practice guidelines were used to determine screening trends.RESULTSThe search yielded 3577 children age 19 years or younger with achondroplasia. Of them, 236 met criteria for inclusion in the screening analysis. Among the screening cohort, 41.9% received some form of screening for foramen magnum stenosis, whereas 13.9% of patients were fully and appropriately screened according to the 2005 guidelines from the AAP. The screening rate significantly increased after the issuance of the AAP guidelines. Among all children in the cohort, 25 underwent cervicomedullary decompression for foramen magnum stenosis. The incidence rate of undergoing cervicomedullary decompression was highest in infancy (28 per 1000 patient-years) and decreased with age (5 per 1000 patient-years for all other ages combined).CONCLUSIONSChildren with achondroplasia continue to be underscreened for foramen magnum stenosis, although screening rates have improved since the release of the 2005 AAP surveillance guidelines. The incidence of surgery was highest in infants and decreased with age.",

The feasibility of the physical fitness tests and IPAQ was explored. Forty-three adults (22 women) participated. Mean age was 38 years (range 16-69 years). Mean differences (95% CI) for men and women with ACH compared to reference values were: VO2 peak. -7.0 m/min/kg (-13.6 to -0.5, p = .037), and - 7.9 ml/kg/min (-11.6 to -4.3, p < .001); 6MWT -270.8 m (-340.4 to -201.2, p < .001), and - 196.7 m (-244.3 to -149.0, p = .001); 30sSTS -4.6 repetitions (-7.8 to -1.5, p = .006), and - 1.1 repetitions (-3.4 to 1.1, p = .335). There were no differences within ACH participants, except for VO2 peak, where men performed better. Sufficient physical activity (> 600 metabolic equivalent of task weekly) was achieved by 79% of the participants. The feasibility of the 6MWT and 30sSTS was good. There was a strong correlation between the VO2 peak and 6MWT (men: r = 0.63, p = .007; women: r = 0.71, p < .001).

However, there is a lack of clinical guidelines and reliable estimates of the benefits and risks of these interventions. This study aimed to summarize the literature on the neurosurgical management of pediatric achondroplasia patients in order to aid in determining optimal treatment and standardization of care. METHODS: A systematic review of peer-reviewed studies with an objective diagnosis of achondroplasia, patient demographic information, and available data on neurosurgical interventions performed before 18 years of age for cervicomedullary compression, spinal stenosis, and hydrocephalus was performed. Study quality and risks of bias were assessed using standardized scores. Independent patient data on surgical indications, outcomes, reoperations, and complication risks were aggregated using means and percentages. RESULTS: Of 204 records, 25 studies with 287 pediatric achondroplasia patients (mean age 25 +- 36 months) treated for cervicomedullary compression (n = 153), spinal stenosis (n = 100), and obstructive hydrocephalus (n = 34) were evaluated. Symptomatic cervicomedullary compression occurred early in life (mean age 31 +- 25 months), with apnea (48%), T2-weighted MRI cord signal (28%), myelopathy (27%), and delayed motor skills (15%) requiring foramen magnum decompression observed in 99% of patients, as well as cervical laminectomy in 65% of patients. Although 91% of treated patients had resolution of symptoms, 2% mortality, 9% reoperation, and 21% complication rates were reported. Spinal stenosis was treated in relatively older children (mean age 13 +- 3 years) with laminectomy (23%), as well as with instrumented fusion (73%) for neurogenic claudication (59%), back pain (15%), and sciatica (8%). Although 95% of patients had symptom resolution after surgery, 17% reported complications and 18% required reoperation. Of the hydrocephalus patients (mean age 56 +- 103 months), half were treated with endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) and half had a shunt placed for progressive ventriculomegaly (66%), headaches (32%), and delayed cognitive development (4%). The shunted patients had a 3% mortality rate and an average of 1.5 shunt revisions per patient. None of the patients who underwent ETV as the primary procedure required a revision. CONCLUSIONS: Neurosurgical intervention for pediatric achondroplasia conditions, including cervicomedullary compression, spinal stenosis, and hydrocephalus, is associated with high recovery rates and good outcomes. However, complications and reoperations are common. Further studies with follow-up into adulthood are needed to evaluate the long-term outcomes.",

Data were entered and stored in a Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) database. RESULTS: Information from one thousand three hundred and seventy-four patients with achondroplasia were included in this study. Four hundred and eight (29.7%) patients had at least one orthopedic surgery during their lifetime and 299 (21.8%) patients underwent multiple procedures. 12.7% (n = 175) of patients underwent spine surgery at a mean age at first surgery of 22.4 +- 15.3 years old. The median age was 16.7 years old (0.1-67.4). 21.2% (n = 291) of patients underwent lower extremity surgery at a mean age at first surgery of 9.9 +- 8.3 years old with a median age of 8.2 years (0.2-57.8). The most common spinal procedure was decompression (152 patients underwent 271 laminectomy procedures), while the most common lower extremity procedure was osteotomy (200 patients underwent 434 procedures). Fifty-eight (4.2%) patients had both a spine and lower extremity surgery. Specific risk factors increasing the likelihood of orthopedic surgery included: patients with hydrocephalus requiring shunt placement having higher odds of undergoing spine surgery (OR 1.97, 95% CI 1.14-3.26); patients having a cervicomedullary decompression also had higher odds of undergoing spine surgery (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.30-2.63); and having lower extremity surgery increased the odds of spine surgery (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.45-2.90). CONCLUSIONS: Orthopedic surgery was a common occurrence in achondroplasia with 29.7% of patients undergoing at least one orthopedic procedure. Spine surgery (12.7%) was less common and occurred at a later age than lower extremity surgery (21.2%). Cervicomedullary decompression and hydrocephalus with shunt placement were associated with an increased risk for spine surgery. The results from CLARITY, the largest natural history study of achondroplasia, should aid clinicians in counseling patients and families about orthopedic surgery.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Pediatric achondroplasia is often associated with conditions requiring neurosurgical intervention, including CSF diversion and multilevel spinal decompression. However, there is a lack of clinical guidelines and reliable estimates of the benefits and risks of these interventions. This study aimed to summarize the literature on the neurosurgical management of pediatric achondroplasia patients in order to aid in determining optimal treatment and standardization of care. METHODS: A systematic review of peer-reviewed studies with an objective diagnosis of achondroplasia, patient demographic information, and available data on neurosurgical interventions performed before 18 years of age for cervicomedullary compression, spinal stenosis, and hydrocephalus was performed. Study quality and risks of bias were assessed using standardized scores. Independent patient data on surgical indications, outcomes, reoperations, and complication risks were aggregated using means and percentages. RESULTS: Of 204 records, 25 studies with 287 pediatric achondroplasia patients (mean age 25 +- 36 months) treated for cervicomedullary compression (n = 153), spinal stenosis (n = 100), and obstructive hydrocephalus (n = 34) were evaluated. Symptomatic cervicomedullary compression occurred early in life (mean age 31 +- 25 months), with apnea (48%), T2-weighted MRI cord signal (28%), myelopathy (27%), and delayed motor skills (15%) requiring foramen magnum decompression observed in 99% of patients, as well as cervical laminectomy in 65% of patients. Although 91% of treated patients had resolution of symptoms, 2% mortality, 9% reoperation, and 21% complication rates were reported. Spinal stenosis was treated in relatively older children (mean age 13 +- 3 years) with laminectomy (23%), as well as with instrumented fusion (73%) for neurogenic claudication (59%), back pain (15%), and sciatica (8%). Although 95% of patients had symptom resolution after surgery, 17% reported complications and 18% required reoperation. Of the hydrocephalus patients (mean age 56 +- 103 months), half were treated with endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) and half had a shunt placed for progressive ventriculomegaly (66%), headaches (32%), and delayed cognitive development (4%). The shunted patients had a 3% mortality rate and an average of 1.5 shunt revisions per patient. None of the patients who underwent ETV as the primary procedure required a revision. CONCLUSIONS: Neurosurgical intervention for pediatric achondroplasia conditions, including cervicomedullary compression, spinal stenosis, and hydrocephalus, is associated with high recovery rates and good outcomes. However, complications and reoperations are common. Further studies with follow-up into adulthood are needed to evaluate the long-term outcomes.",

Vosoritide is a biologic analogue of C-type natriuretic peptide, a potent stimulator of endochondral ossification. METHODS: In a multinational, phase 2, dose-finding study and extension study, we evaluated the safety and side-effect profile of vosoritide in children (5 to 14 years of age) with achondroplasia. A total of 35 children were enrolled in four sequential cohorts to receive vosoritide at a once-daily subcutaneous dose of 2.5 mug per kilogram of body weight (8 patients in cohort 1), 7.5 mug per kilogram (8 patients in cohort 2), 15.0 mug per kilogram (10 patients in cohort 3), or 30.0 mug per kilogram (9 patients in cohort 4). After 6 months, the dose in cohort 1 was increased to 7.5 mug per kilogram and then to 15.0 mug per kilogram, and in cohort 2, the dose was increased to 15.0 mug per kilogram; the patients in cohorts 3 and 4 continued to receive their initial doses. At the time of data cutoff, the 24-month dose-finding study had been completed, and 30 patients had been enrolled in an ongoing long-term extension study; the median duration of follow-up across both studies was 42 months. RESULTS: During the treatment periods in the dose-finding and extension studies, adverse events occurred in 35 of 35 patients (100%), and serious adverse events occurred in 4 of 35 patients (11%). Therapy was discontinued in 6 patients (in 1 because of an adverse event). During the first 6 months of treatment, a dose-dependent increase in the annualized growth velocity was observed with vosoritide up to a dose of 15.0 mug per kilogram, and a sustained increase in the annualized growth velocity was observed at doses of 15.0 and 30.0 mug per kilogram for up to 42 months. CONCLUSIONS: In children with achondroplasia, once-daily subcutaneous administration of vosoritide was associated with a side-effect profile that appeared generally mild. Treatment resulted in a sustained increase in the annualized growth velocity for up to 42 months.

The feasibility of the physical fitness tests and IPAQ was explored. Forty-three adults (22 women) participated. Mean age was 38 years (range 16-69 years). Mean differences (95% CI) for men and women with ACH compared to reference values were: VO2 peak. -7.0 m/min/kg (-13.6 to -0.5, p = .037), and - 7.9 ml/kg/min (-11.6 to -4.3, p < .001); 6MWT -270.8 m (-340.4 to -201.2, p < .001), and - 196.7 m (-244.3 to -149.0, p = .001); 30sSTS -4.6 repetitions (-7.8 to -1.5, p = .006), and - 1.1 repetitions (-3.4 to 1.1, p = .335). There were no differences within ACH participants, except for VO2 peak, where men performed better. Sufficient physical activity (> 600 metabolic equivalent of task weekly) was achieved by 79% of the participants. The feasibility of the 6MWT and 30sSTS was good. There was a strong correlation between the VO2 peak and 6MWT (men: r = 0.63, p = .007; women: r = 0.71, p < .001). The findings indicate that the 6MWT and 30sSTS test are useful in assessing functional exercise capacity and muscle strength in adults with ACH.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This manuscript describes the clinical and operative characteristics of achondroplastic children who undergo multilevel thoracolumbar decompressions using either the high-speed drill or the ultrasonic bone curette (BoneScalpel). METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 30 thoracolumbar decompressions in achondroplastic patients at a single institution between 2008 and 2013. Patients were classified into either the high-speed drill cohort or the BoneScalpel cohort, depending on which instrument was utilized to perform the decompression. A technical note on the role of the ultrasonic bone curette in decompressing stenotic achondroplastic spines is also provided. RESULTS: In comparison with the high-speed drill cohort, the BoneScalpel cohort experienced less overall perioperative complications, including durotomy, cerebrospinal fluid leak, pseudomeningoceles, wound infection, and wound dehiscence. Although 45.0% of patients experienced a durotomy in the high-speed drill cohort, only 30.0% of patients experienced a durotomy in the BoneScalpel cohort (P = 0.694). In the high-speed drill cohort, the number of patients complaining of sensory disturbances, back pain, ataxia, incontinence, neurogenic claudication, radiculopathy, ataxia, and/or weakness decreased postoperatively. Similar results were observed in the BoneScalpel cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Although spinal decompression provides symptomatic resolution in patients with achondroplasia, intraoperative complications, in general, and durotomies, in particular, are common. Here, we report a decreased incidence in intraoperative durotomy and overall perioperative complication rates in the BoneScalpel cohort, although this did not reach the level of statistical significance. Nonetheless, the data demonstrate that the BoneScalpel is a safe and efficacious alternative to the high-speed drill in these challenging patients. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II-retrospective study.",

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 30 thoracolumbar decompressions in achondroplastic patients at a single institution between 2008 and 2013. Patients were classified into either the high-speed drill cohort or the BoneScalpel cohort, depending on which instrument was utilized to perform the decompression. A technical note on the role of the ultrasonic bone curette in decompressing stenotic achondroplastic spines is also provided. RESULTS: In comparison with the high-speed drill cohort, the BoneScalpel cohort experienced less overall perioperative complications, including durotomy, cerebrospinal fluid leak, pseudomeningoceles, wound infection, and wound dehiscence. Although 45.0% of patients experienced a durotomy in the high-speed drill cohort, only 30.0% of patients experienced a durotomy in the BoneScalpel cohort (P = 0.694). In the high-speed drill cohort, the number of patients complaining of sensory disturbances, back pain, ataxia, incontinence, neurogenic claudication, radiculopathy, ataxia, and/or weakness decreased postoperatively. Similar results were observed in the BoneScalpel cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Although spinal decompression provides symptomatic resolution in patients with achondroplasia, intraoperative complications, in general, and durotomies, in particular, are common. Here, we report a decreased incidence in intraoperative durotomy and overall perioperative complication rates in the BoneScalpel cohort, although this did not reach the level of statistical significance. Nonetheless, the data demonstrate that the BoneScalpel is a safe and efficacious alternative to the high-speed drill in these challenging patients. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II-retrospective study.",

                    "abstract": "STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the trends in management and inpatient outcomes in patients with syndromic scoliosis undergoing spinal deformity correction. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Syndromic scoliosis (SS) refers to scoliosis that is most commonly associated with systemic disease including Ehler Danhlos syndrome (EDS), Marfan syndrome (MF), Down syndrome (DS), Achondroplasia (AP), and Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). Limited data exist evaluating hospital outcomes in patients with SS undergoing spinal deformity correction. METHODS: The Kids' Inpatient Database (KIDS) was queried from 2001 to 2012 to identify all pediatric patients with scoliosis undergoing spinal fusion. These patients were then sub-divided into two cohorts: (1) patients with idiopathic scoliosis (IS) and (2) patients with syndromic scoliosis. Trends in surgical management, and postoperative morbidity and mortality were assessed. Length of stay and total hospital charges were additionally analyzed. A sub-analysis to characterize outcomes in each syndrome was also performed. RESULTS: An estimated 1071 patients with SS were identified and compared with 24,989 pediatric patients with IS. MF (36.8%), Down syndrome (16.0%), and PWS (14.9%) were the most common diagnoses among patients with SS. Between 2001 and 2012, there was a significant decline in the number of anterior procedures performed in both cohorts. Conversely, the number of posterior based procedures increased. SS was associated with increased major complications (2.7% compared with 1.0% in IS; P < 0.001) and minor complication rates (41.0% compared with 28.5% in IS; P < 0.001). Patients with AP incurred the highest rate of major complications (10.7%), minor complications (60.8%), and intraoperative durotomies (6.1%). Total hospital charges increased significantly over the 12-year span. CONCLUSION: Trends in management of syndromic scoliosis have paralleled that of idiopathic scoliosis. Syndromic scoliosis is associated with increased risks with surgical deformity correction. Further prospective studies are warranted to evaluate the reasons for these differences.

                    "abstract": "STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the trends in management and inpatient outcomes in patients with syndromic scoliosis undergoing spinal deformity correction. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Syndromic scoliosis (SS) refers to scoliosis that is most commonly associated with systemic disease including Ehler Danhlos syndrome (EDS), Marfan syndrome (MF), Down syndrome (DS), Achondroplasia (AP), and Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). Limited data exist evaluating hospital outcomes in patients with SS undergoing spinal deformity correction. METHODS: The Kids' Inpatient Database (KIDS) was queried from 2001 to 2012 to identify all pediatric patients with scoliosis undergoing spinal fusion. These patients were then sub-divided into two cohorts: (1) patients with idiopathic scoliosis (IS) and (2) patients with syndromic scoliosis. Trends in surgical management, and postoperative morbidity and mortality were assessed. Length of stay and total hospital charges were additionally analyzed. A sub-analysis to characterize outcomes in each syndrome was also performed. RESULTS: An estimated 1071 patients with SS were identified and compared with 24,989 pediatric patients with IS. MF (36.8%), Down syndrome (16.0%), and PWS (14.9%) were the most common diagnoses among patients with SS. Between 2001 and 2012, there was a significant decline in the number of anterior procedures performed in both cohorts. Conversely, the number of posterior based procedures increased. SS was associated with increased major complications (2.7% compared with 1.0% in IS; P < 0.001) and minor complication rates (41.0% compared with 28.5% in IS; P < 0.001). Patients with AP incurred the highest rate of major complications (10.7%), minor complications (60.8%), and intraoperative durotomies (6.1%). Total hospital charges increased significantly over the 12-year span. CONCLUSION: Trends in management of syndromic scoliosis have paralleled that of idiopathic scoliosis. Syndromic scoliosis is associated with increased risks with surgical deformity correction. Further prospective studies are warranted to evaluate the reasons for these differences.

CLARITY (The Achondroplasia Natural History Study) includes clinical data from achondroplasia patients receiving treatment at four skeletal dysplasia centers in the United States from 1957 to 2018. Data were entered and stored in a Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) database. RESULTS: Information from one thousand three hundred and seventy-four patients with achondroplasia were included in this study. Four hundred and eight (29.7%) patients had at least one orthopedic surgery during their lifetime and 299 (21.8%) patients underwent multiple procedures. 12.7% (n = 175) of patients underwent spine surgery at a mean age at first surgery of 22.4 +- 15.3 years old. The median age was 16.7 years old (0.1-67.4). 21.2% (n = 291) of patients underwent lower extremity surgery at a mean age at first surgery of 9.9 +- 8.3 years old with a median age of 8.2 years (0.2-57.8). The most common spinal procedure was decompression (152 patients underwent 271 laminectomy procedures), while the most common lower extremity procedure was osteotomy (200 patients underwent 434 procedures). Fifty-eight (4.2%) patients had both a spine and lower extremity surgery. Specific risk factors increasing the likelihood of orthopedic surgery included: patients with hydrocephalus requiring shunt placement having higher odds of undergoing spine surgery (OR 1.97, 95% CI 1.14-3.26); patients having a cervicomedullary decompression also had higher odds of undergoing spine surgery (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.30-2.63); and having lower extremity surgery increased the odds of spine surgery (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.45-2.90). CONCLUSIONS: Orthopedic surgery was a common occurrence in achondroplasia with 29.7% of patients undergoing at least one orthopedic procedure. Spine surgery (12.7%) was less common and occurred at a later age than lower extremity surgery (21.2%). Cervicomedullary decompression and hydrocephalus with shunt placement were associated with an increased risk for spine surgery. The results from CLARITY, the largest natural history study of achondroplasia, should aid clinicians in counseling patients and families about orthopedic surgery.",

Vosoritide is a C-natriuretic peptide analogue that has been shown to improve endochondral ossification in children with achondroplasia. The objective of this trial is to evaluate the safety of vosoritide and whether vosoritide can improve the growth of the foramen magnum and spinal canal in children that may require decompression surgery. An Achondroplasia Foramen Magnum Score will be used to identify infants at risk of requiring decompression surgery. This is a 2-year open label randomized controlled trial of vosoritide in infants with achondroplasia ages 0 to <=12 months. Approximately 20 infants will be randomized 1:1 to either open label once daily subcutaneous vosoritide combined with standard of care or standard of care alone. The primary and secondary aims of the study are to evaluate the safety and efficacy of vosoritide in children with cervicomedullary compression at risk of requiring decompression surgery. The trial will be carried out in specialized skeletal dysplasia treatment centers with well established multidisciplinary care pathways and standardized approaches to the neurosurgical management of cervicomedually compression. After 2 years, infants randomized to standard of care alone will be eligible to switch to vosoritide plus standard of care for an additional 3 years. This pioneering trial hopes to address the important question as to whether treatment with vosoritide at an early age in infants at risk of requiring cervicomedullary decompression surgery is safe, and can improve growth at the foramen magnum and spinal canal alleviating stenosis. This in turn may reduce compression of surrounding structures including the neuraxis and spinal cord, which could alleviate future morbidity and mortality.Trial registrations: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04554940; EudraCT number, 2020-001055-40.",

                    "abstract": "Achondroplasia (ACH) is the prototype and most common of the human chondrodysplasias. It results from gain-of-function mutations that exaggerate the signal output of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3), a receptor tyrosine kinase that negatively regulates growth plate activity and linear bone growth. Several approaches to reduce FGFR3 signaling by blocking receptor activation or inhibiting downstream signals have been proposed. Five show promise in preclinical mouse studies. Two candidate therapies target the extracellular domain of FGFR3. The first is a decoy receptor that competes for activating ligands. The second is a synthetic blocking peptide that prevents ligands from binding and activating FGFR3. Two established drugs, statins and meclozine, improve growth of ACH mice. The strongest candidate therapy employs an analog of C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), which antagonizes the mitogen-activated-protein (MAP) kinase pathway downstream of the FGFR3 receptor and may also act independently in the growth plate. Only the CNP analog has reached clinical trials. Preliminary results of Phase 2 studies show a substantial increase in growth rate of ACH children after six months of therapy with no serious adverse effects. A challenge for drug therapy in ACH is targeting agents to the avascular growth plate. The application of gene therapy in osteoarthritis offers insights because it faces similar technical obstacles. Major advances in gene therapy include the emergence of recombinant adeno-associated virus as the vector of choice, capsid engineering to target vectors to specific tissues, and development of methods to direct vectors to articular chondrocytes.

Due to short stature and kyphoscoliosis, endovascular access (Cannulation) of the coronary arteries is usually extremely difficult in such patients. CASE PRESENTATION: A 33 years old patient, a known case of achondroplasia, presented with epigastric pain for 3 h duration to a university hospital, Sudan. Her height was 95 cm and her weight was 38 Kg. A trans-femoral approach for coronary angioplasty was preferred. After it has been extremely difficult to cannulate the left system at first, the cannulation has been performed successfully using 5F, JL3.5 catheter. The angiogram depicted total occlusion of the proximal right coronary artery which was found to be originating from the left coronary sinus of the aorta. Successful trans-femoral coronary angioplasty has been performed with stent placement, and no complications encountered. During her last follow up, 1 year after the procedure, she appeared to be free of symptoms and with no further ischemic attacks or procedure-related complications. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of successful coronary angioplasty in achondroplasia patient in whom the occluded artery is an anomalous coronary artery. Literature review, description of the achondroplasia, development of the coronary arteries and the hypothesized theory for the anomaly have been described in this case report.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Surgery to achieve long bone lengthening and deformity correction in skeletally immature patients is traditionally performed through external fixators. The incidence of infection during treatment is high. Hydrotherapy is highly beneficial during external fixation management, but the infection rates may impact its utilization. The objective of this paper is to document the incidence and duration of infection in patients who participated in a full hydrotherapy program when performed under medical supervision and in accordance with strict follow-up protocols. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we documented the key characteristics of patients who participated in hydrotherapy after lower limb external fixation surgery including age, sex, diagnosis and surgery site, the incidence and duration of pin site infections, and the percentage of cases, which were able to comply with a full hydrotherapy protocol. RESULTS: The hydrotherapy pool met all daily water quality metrics. Thirty-four children (19 males and 15 females) had a mean+-SD age of 10.9+-4.6 years. Of the cases, 80% were unilateral and 20% were bilateral. Diagnoses included congenital hereditary (eg, achondroplasia), congenital nonhereditary conditions (eg, fibular hemimelia), and acquired conditions (eg, traumatic). The location of osteotomy site was quite evenly spread between the femur and the tibia/fibula. Three out of the 34 patients were unable to receive hydrotherapy due to continuous secretions; 2 patients did not miss any sessions. The mean number of treatments was 3 per week. During the entire period, a total of 1200 treatments were performed for these patients with only 32 cancellations (about 3%) due to secretions or other signs of infection. Spearman correlation coefficients showed significantly high correlations between the duration of external fixation and the duration of hydrotherapy. There are no significant correlations between infections and other factors (sex, age segment, whether the problem is unilateral or /bilateral, diagnosis, and duration of treatment). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report, to our knowledge, that documents the low prevalence of infectious events during hydrotherapy treatment and demonstrates its feasibility.

Vosoritide is a biologic analogue of C-type natriuretic peptide, a potent stimulator of endochondral ossification. METHODS: In a multinational, phase 2, dose-finding study and extension study, we evaluated the safety and side-effect profile of vosoritide in children (5 to 14 years of age) with achondroplasia. A total of 35 children were enrolled in four sequential cohorts to receive vosoritide at a once-daily subcutaneous dose of 2.5 mug per kilogram of body weight (8 patients in cohort 1), 7.5 mug per kilogram (8 patients in cohort 2), 15.0 mug per kilogram (10 patients in cohort 3), or 30.0 mug per kilogram (9 patients in cohort 4). After 6 months, the dose in cohort 1 was increased to 7.5 mug per kilogram and then to 15.0 mug per kilogram, and in cohort 2, the dose was increased to 15.0 mug per kilogram; the patients in cohorts 3 and 4 continued to receive their initial doses. At the time of data cutoff, the 24-month dose-finding study had been completed, and 30 patients had been enrolled in an ongoing long-term extension study; the median duration of follow-up across both studies was 42 months. RESULTS: During the treatment periods in the dose-finding and extension studies, adverse events occurred in 35 of 35 patients (100%), and serious adverse events occurred in 4 of 35 patients (11%). Therapy was discontinued in 6 patients (in 1 because of an adverse event). During the first 6 months of treatment, a dose-dependent increase in the annualized growth velocity was observed with vosoritide up to a dose of 15.0 mug per kilogram, and a sustained increase in the annualized growth velocity was observed at doses of 15.0 and 30.0 mug per kilogram for up to 42 months. CONCLUSIONS: In children with achondroplasia, once-daily subcutaneous administration of vosoritide was associated with a side-effect profile that appeared generally mild. Treatment resulted in a sustained increase in the annualized growth velocity for up to 42 months.

The pharmacokinetics of vosoritide and relationships between plasma exposure and efficacy, biomarkers, and safety endpoints were evaluated in a phase II, open-label, dose-escalation study (N = 35 patients aged 5-14 years who received daily subcutaneous injections for 24 months) and a phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (N = 60 patients aged 5-18 years randomized to receive daily subcutaneous injections for 52 weeks). METHODS: Pharmacokinetic parameters for both studies were obtained from non-compartmental analysis. Potential correlations between vosoritide exposure and changes in annualized growth velocity, collagen type X marker (CXM; a biomarker of endochondral ossification), cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP; a biomarker of pharmacological activity), heart rate, and systolic and diastolic blood pressures were then evaluated. RESULTS: The exposure-response relationships for changes in both annualized growth velocity and the CXM biomarker saturated at 15 mug/kg, while systemic pharmacological activity, as measured by urinary cGMP, was near maximal or saturated at exposures obtained at the highest dose studied (i.e. 30 mug/kg). This suggested that the additional bioactivity was likely in tissues not related to endochondral bone formation. In the phase III study, following subcutaneous administration at the recommended dose of 15 mug/kg to patients with achondroplasia aged 5-18 years, vosoritide was rapidly absorbed with a median time to maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) of 15 minutes, and cleared with a mean half-life of 27.9 minutes after 52 weeks of treatment. Vosoritide exposure (Cmax and area under the concentration-time curve [AUC]) was consistent across visits. No evidence of accumulation with once-daily dosing was observed. Total anti-vosoritide antibody (TAb) responses were detected in the serum of 25 of 60 (42%) treated patients in the phase III study, with no apparent impact of TAb development noted on annualized growth velocity or vosoritide exposure. Across the exposure range obtained with 15 microg/kg in the phase III study, no meaningful correlations between vosoritide plasma exposure and changes in annualized growth velocity or CXM, or changes from predose heart rate, and systolic or diastolic blood pressures were observed. CONCLUSIONS: The results support the recommended dose of vosoritide 15 microg/kg for once-daily subcutaneous administration in patients with achondroplasia aged >= 5 years whose epiphyses are not closed.

An open-label study suggested that vosoritide administration might increase growth velocity in children with achondroplasia. This phase 3 trial was designed to further assess these preliminary findings. METHODS: This randomised, double-blind, phase 3, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial compared once-daily subcutaneous administration of vosoritide with placebo in children with achondroplasia. The trial was done in hospitals at 24 sites in seven countries (Australia, Germany, Japan, Spain, Turkey, the USA, and the UK). Eligible patients had a clinical diagnosis of achondroplasia, were ambulatory, had participated for 6 months in a baseline growth study and were aged 5 to less than 18 years at enrolment. Randomisation was done by means of a voice or web-response system, stratified according to sex and Tanner stage. Participants, investigators, and trial sponsor were masked to group assignment. Participants received either vosoritide 15 0 mug/kg or placebo, as allocated, for the duration of the 52-week treatment period administered by daily subcutaneous injections in their homes by trained caregivers. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in mean annualised growth velocity at 52 weeks in treated patients as compared with controls. All randomly assigned patients were included in the efficacy analyses (n=121). All patients who received one dose of vosoritide or placebo (n=121) were included in the safety analyses. The trial is complete and is registered, with EudraCT, number, 2015-003836-11. FINDINGS: All participants were recruited from Dec 12, 2016, to Nov 7, 2018, with 60 assigned to receive vosoritide and 61 to receive placebo. Of 124 patients screened for eligibility, 121 patients were randomly assigned, and 119 patients completed the 52-week trial. The adjusted mean difference in annualised growth velocity between patients in the vosoritide group and placebo group was 1 57 cm/year in favour of vosoritide (95% CI [1 22-1 93]; two-sided p<0 0001). A total of 119 patients had at least one adverse event; vosoritide group, 59 (98%), and placebo group, 60 (98%). None of the serious adverse events were considered to be treatment related and no deaths occurred. INTERPRETATION: Vosoritide is an effective treatment to increase growth in children with achondroplasia. It is not known whether final adult height will be increased, or what the harms of long-term therapy might be. FUNDING: BioMarin Pharmaceutical.",

Vosoritide is a C-natriuretic peptide analogue that has been shown to improve endochondral ossification in children with achondroplasia. The objective of this trial is to evaluate the safety of vosoritide and whether vosoritide can improve the growth of the foramen magnum and spinal canal in children that may require decompression surgery. An Achondroplasia Foramen Magnum Score will be used to identify infants at risk of requiring decompression surgery. This is a 2-year open label randomized controlled trial of vosoritide in infants with achondroplasia ages 0 to <=12 months. Approximately 20 infants will be randomized 1:1 to either open label once daily subcutaneous vosoritide combined with standard of care or standard of care alone. The primary and secondary aims of the study are to evaluate the safety and efficacy of vosoritide in children with cervicomedullary compression at risk of requiring decompression surgery. The trial will be carried out in specialized skeletal dysplasia treatment centers with well established multidisciplinary care pathways and standardized approaches to the neurosurgical management of cervicomedually compression. After 2 years, infants randomized to standard of care alone will be eligible to switch to vosoritide plus standard of care for an additional 3 years. This pioneering trial hopes to address the important question as to whether treatment with vosoritide at an early age in infants at risk of requiring cervicomedullary decompression surgery is safe, and can improve growth at the foramen magnum and spinal canal alleviating stenosis. This in turn may reduce compression of surrounding structures including the neuraxis and spinal cord, which could alleviate future morbidity and mortality.Trial registrations: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04554940; EudraCT number, 2020-001055-40.",

Respiratory failure is responsible for most deaths among these children and is often related to cervicomedullary compression (CMC). We present our experience with early cervicomedullary decompression in infants with achondroplasia. METHODS: Data was retrospectively collected for infants with achondroplasia who underwent CMC decompression between 1998 and 2013. Data included presurgical and postsurgical neurological examinations, MRI scans, and sleep study results. RESULTS: Ten infants were included. Ages at surgery were 4 to 23 months (12.5 +- 6.88 months). All infants displayed neurological findings prior to surgery, although often subtle. All infants underwent a foramen magnum opening with a wide C1 laminectomy. Following surgery, seven patients (70 %) demonstrated improved neurological status, and one displayed neurological deterioration. Seven patients demonstrated improved sleep quality 1 year after surgery. These patients had a good or improved neurological status following surgery. Preoperative radiological findings included abnormal hyperintense T2 changes in all children (improved following surgery in six children), brainstem distortion in four children (improved in all), and diminished cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) spaces at the level of the foramen magnum in eight children (improved in seven). One child with extensive preoperative T2 changes accompanied by neurological and respiratory decline, deteriorated following surgery, and remains chronically ventilated. CONCLUSIONS: Infants with achondroplasia are prone to neurological and respiratory symptoms. We believe that early diagnosis and early surgery for decompression of the foramen magnum and C1 lamina can alleviate respiratory symptoms, improve neurological status, and perhaps prevent sudden infant death in this population.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Achondroplasia is the most common form of dwarfism. Respiratory failure is responsible for most deaths among these children and is often related to cervicomedullary compression (CMC). We present our experience with early cervicomedullary decompression in infants with achondroplasia. METHODS: Data was retrospectively collected for infants with achondroplasia who underwent CMC decompression between 1998 and 2013. Data included presurgical and postsurgical neurological examinations, MRI scans, and sleep study results. RESULTS: Ten infants were included. Ages at surgery were 4 to 23 months (12.5 +- 6.88 months). All infants displayed neurological findings prior to surgery, although often subtle. All infants underwent a foramen magnum opening with a wide C1 laminectomy. Following surgery, seven patients (70 %) demonstrated improved neurological status, and one displayed neurological deterioration. Seven patients demonstrated improved sleep quality 1 year after surgery. These patients had a good or improved neurological status following surgery. Preoperative radiological findings included abnormal hyperintense T2 changes in all children (improved following surgery in six children), brainstem distortion in four children (improved in all), and diminished cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) spaces at the level of the foramen magnum in eight children (improved in seven). One child with extensive preoperative T2 changes accompanied by neurological and respiratory decline, deteriorated following surgery, and remains chronically ventilated. CONCLUSIONS: Infants with achondroplasia are prone to neurological and respiratory symptoms. We believe that early diagnosis and early surgery for decompression of the foramen magnum and C1 lamina can alleviate respiratory symptoms, improve neurological status, and perhaps prevent sudden infant death in this population.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Achondroplasia typically results in compressive spinal canal stenosis in one-third of children, but rare under the age of 15 years. Laminectomy is the mainstay of treatment but this leads to instability and progressive deformity requiring complex fixation. In order to reduce that risk, we developed a novel modified augmented laminoplasty that increases spinal canal diameter while preserving the posterior column stability. METHODS: All laminoplasty cases for spinal compressive achondroplasia from 2006 to 2020 were included. Ten augmentation laminoplasty procedures were performed in 7 children with regular clinical and radiological post-operative follow-up. Kyphotic deformity and clinical outcomes (neurological and urological) were evaluated. RESULTS: At presentation, clinical features included radiculopathy, neurogenic claudication or acute cauda equina compression with sphincter dysfunction. The average age at initial surgery was 11.2 (range 5-16) with a mean follow-up of 5 (range 2-8) years. All patients demonstrated improvement in neurogenic claudication symptoms after surgery; however, bladder dysfunction persisted in some children. In one child, cervical and lumbar augmentation laminoplasties were performed for concomitant disease. Augmentation laminoplasty effectively prevented deformity progression over time in all cases except one where a further revision laminoplasty with extension was required for screw loosening. Despite this, progressive symptomatic kyphotic deformity led to a 360  fixation. Minor complications included one dural breach (repaired intraoperatively) and one superficial wound infection. CONCLUSION: Augmentation laminoplasty is a viable surgical option following laminectomy in achondroplasia patients as an alternative to surgical fixation. Fixation can be reserved for cases where there is progressive deformity and kyphosis.",

The study included patients with a genetically confirmed diagnosis of achondroplasia. The experimental group consisted of 14 patients who underwent surgical limb lengthening by the rod monolateral external fixator with a distraction system developed by the authors. The lengthening was performed on 28 segments of tubular bones. The majority of the experimental group patients achieved the lengthening value close to the planned one and the deformation correction. The fixation period was averagely 83.8 +- 3.7 days, the regenerate length was 8.5 +- 0.6 cm, and the mechanical strength of the distraction regenerate was 10.3  +- 2.18 . The rod external fixator with a control distraction system developed by the authors has small dimensions and low weight of the external supporting elements of high durability. It is reported to provide a good psychological tolerance of the treatment process and significantly outperforms the circular multi-axis system. Considering the aforementioned, the proposed apparatus can grant good orthopedic care to patients with achondroplasia.",

                    "abstract": "STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the trends in management and inpatient outcomes in patients with syndromic scoliosis undergoing spinal deformity correction. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Syndromic scoliosis (SS) refers to scoliosis that is most commonly associated with systemic disease including Ehler Danhlos syndrome (EDS), Marfan syndrome (MF), Down syndrome (DS), Achondroplasia (AP), and Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). Limited data exist evaluating hospital outcomes in patients with SS undergoing spinal deformity correction. METHODS: The Kids' Inpatient Database (KIDS) was queried from 2001 to 2012 to identify all pediatric patients with scoliosis undergoing spinal fusion. These patients were then sub-divided into two cohorts: (1) patients with idiopathic scoliosis (IS) and (2) patients with syndromic scoliosis. Trends in surgical management, and postoperative morbidity and mortality were assessed. Length of stay and total hospital charges were additionally analyzed. A sub-analysis to characterize outcomes in each syndrome was also performed. RESULTS: An estimated 1071 patients with SS were identified and compared with 24,989 pediatric patients with IS. MF (36.8%), Down syndrome (16.0%), and PWS (14.9%) were the most common diagnoses among patients with SS. Between 2001 and 2012, there was a significant decline in the number of anterior procedures performed in both cohorts. Conversely, the number of posterior based procedures increased. SS was associated with increased major complications (2.7% compared with 1.0% in IS; P < 0.001) and minor complication rates (41.0% compared with 28.5% in IS; P < 0.001). Patients with AP incurred the highest rate of major complications (10.7%), minor complications (60.8%), and intraoperative durotomies (6.1%). Total hospital charges increased significantly over the 12-year span. CONCLUSION: Trends in management of syndromic scoliosis have paralleled that of idiopathic scoliosis. Syndromic scoliosis is associated with increased risks with surgical deformity correction. Further prospective studies are warranted to evaluate the reasons for these differences.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The use of modern rigid instrumentation in pediatric cervical fusions decreases the risk of implant-related complications, both acute and long term. However, previous studies have indicated that acute implant-related issues still occur in the adult population. Reports of pediatric acute implant complications, occurring within 3 months of surgery, are under-represented in the literature. The purpose of this study is to document the prevalence of acute implant-related complications in a pediatric cervical fusion population. METHODS: A retrospective review of instrumented cervical fusions from August 2002 to December 2018 was conducted. Acute implant-related complications were defined as malposition, fracture, or disengagement of cervical instrumentation, including screws, rods, and plates, within 90 days of surgery. RESULTS: A total of 166 cases were included (55% male individuals) with an average age at surgery of 12.5 years (SD, +-5.28). Acute implant-related complications occurred in 5 patients (3%). All 5 patients had a syndromic diagnosis: Loeys-Dietz (n=1), osteopetrosis (n=1), neurofibromatosis (n=1), trisomy 20 (n=1), and achondroplasia (n=1). One case involved asymptomatic screw protrusion, 1 case lateral mass screw pull-out, 2 more had screw-rod disengagement, and the last experienced dislodgement of the anterior plate. The median time until the presentation was 25 days (range, 1 to 79 d). All patients (n=5) required surgical revision. CONCLUSIONS: This case series suggests that the overall incidence of acute cervical implant failure is low. However, failure is more likely to occur in patients with underlying syndromes compared with patients with different etiologies. Intraoperative use of 3-dimensional computed tomography imaging is recommended to evaluate the screw position and potentially avoid later surgery.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The use of modern rigid instrumentation in pediatric cervical fusions decreases the risk of implant-related complications, both acute and long term. However, previous studies have indicated that acute implant-related issues still occur in the adult population. Reports of pediatric acute implant complications, occurring within 3 months of surgery, are under-represented in the literature. The purpose of this study is to document the prevalence of acute implant-related complications in a pediatric cervical fusion population. METHODS: A retrospective review of instrumented cervical fusions from August 2002 to December 2018 was conducted. Acute implant-related complications were defined as malposition, fracture, or disengagement of cervical instrumentation, including screws, rods, and plates, within 90 days of surgery. RESULTS: A total of 166 cases were included (55% male individuals) with an average age at surgery of 12.5 years (SD, +-5.28). Acute implant-related complications occurred in 5 patients (3%). All 5 patients had a syndromic diagnosis: Loeys-Dietz (n=1), osteopetrosis (n=1), neurofibromatosis (n=1), trisomy 20 (n=1), and achondroplasia (n=1). One case involved asymptomatic screw protrusion, 1 case lateral mass screw pull-out, 2 more had screw-rod disengagement, and the last experienced dislodgement of the anterior plate. The median time until the presentation was 25 days (range, 1 to 79 d). All patients (n=5) required surgical revision. CONCLUSIONS: This case series suggests that the overall incidence of acute cervical implant failure is low. However, failure is more likely to occur in patients with underlying syndromes compared with patients with different etiologies. Intraoperative use of 3-dimensional computed tomography imaging is recommended to evaluate the screw position and potentially avoid later surgery.",

Methods: The clinical data of 38 patients with lower limb deformity caused by achondroplasia treated by Ilizarov technique between February 2014 and September 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. There were 18 males and 20 females, the age ranged from 7 to 34 years, with an average of 14.8 years. All patients presented with bilateral knee varus deformity. The preoperative varus angles was (15.2+-4.2) , and knee society score (KSS) was 61.8+-7.2. Nine of these patients underwent tibia and fibula osteotomy, 29 cases underwent tibia and fibula osteotomy and bone lengthening at the same time. Full-length bearing position X-ray films of bilateral lower limbs were taken to measure the bilateral varus angles, analyze the healing index, and record the occurrence of complications. KSS score was used to evaluate the improvement of knee joint function before and after operation. Results: All 38 cases were followed up 9-65 months, with an average of 26.3 months. Needle tract infection occurred in 4 cases and needle tract loosening occurred in 2 cases after operation, which were improved after symptomatic treatment such as dressing change, Kirschner wire change, and oral antibiotics, and no neurovascular injury occurred in all patients. The external fixator was worn for 3-11 months after operation, with an average of 7.6 months, and the healing index was 43-59 d/cm, with an average of 50.3 d/cm. At last follow-up, the leg was 3-10 cm longer, with an average of 5.5 cm. The varus angles was (1.5+-0.2)  and the KSS score was 93.7+-2.6, which significantly improved when compared with those before operation ( P<0.05). Conclusion: Ilizarov technique is a safe and effective method for the treatment of short limb with genu varus deformity caused by achondroplasia, which can improve the quality of life of patients.",

It results from gain-of-function mutations that exaggerate the signal output of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3), a receptor tyrosine kinase that negatively regulates growth plate activity and linear bone growth. Several approaches to reduce FGFR3 signaling by blocking receptor activation or inhibiting downstream signals have been proposed. Five show promise in preclinical mouse studies. Two candidate therapies target the extracellular domain of FGFR3. The first is a decoy receptor that competes for activating ligands. The second is a synthetic blocking peptide that prevents ligands from binding and activating FGFR3. Two established drugs, statins and meclozine, improve growth of ACH mice. The strongest candidate therapy employs an analog of C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), which antagonizes the mitogen-activated-protein (MAP) kinase pathway downstream of the FGFR3 receptor and may also act independently in the growth plate. Only the CNP analog has reached clinical trials. Preliminary results of Phase 2 studies show a substantial increase in growth rate of ACH children after six months of therapy with no serious adverse effects. A challenge for drug therapy in ACH is targeting agents to the avascular growth plate. The application of gene therapy in osteoarthritis offers insights because it faces similar technical obstacles. Major advances in gene therapy include the emergence of recombinant adeno-associated virus as the vector of choice, capsid engineering to target vectors to specific tissues, and development of methods to direct vectors to articular chondrocytes.

We aimed to perform the first study that exclusively analyzed simultaneous bilateral femoral distraction osteogenesis with motorized intramedullary lengthening nails via an antegrade approach in patients with achondroplasia focused on reliability, accuracy, precision, and the evolving complications. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this retrospective singlecenter study we analyzed patients with achondroplasia who underwent simultaneous bilateral femoral lengthening with antegrade intramedullary lengthening nails between October 2014 and April 2019. 15 patients (30 femoral segments) of median age 14 years (interquartile range [IQR] 12-15) were available for analysis. The median follow-up was 29 months (IQR 27-37) after nail implantation. RESULTS: The median distraction length per segment was 49 mm (IQR 47-51) with a median distraction index of 1.0 mm/day (IQR 0.9-1.0), and a median consolidation index of 20 days/cm (IQR 17-23). Reliability of the lengthening nails was 97% and their calculated accuracy and precision were 96% and 95%, respectively. The most common complication was temporary restriction of knee range of motion during distraction in 10 of 30 of the lengthened segments. 1 patient was treated with 2 unplanned additional surgeries due to premature consolidation. CONCLUSION: The method is reliable and accurate with few complications.",

Methods: The clinical data of 38 patients with lower limb deformity caused by achondroplasia treated by Ilizarov technique between February 2014 and September 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. There were 18 males and 20 females, the age ranged from 7 to 34 years, with an average of 14.8 years. All patients presented with bilateral knee varus deformity. The preoperative varus angles was (15.2+-4.2) , and knee society score (KSS) was 61.8+-7.2. Nine of these patients underwent tibia and fibula osteotomy, 29 cases underwent tibia and fibula osteotomy and bone lengthening at the same time. Full-length bearing position X-ray films of bilateral lower limbs were taken to measure the bilateral varus angles, analyze the healing index, and record the occurrence of complications. KSS score was used to evaluate the improvement of knee joint function before and after operation. Results: All 38 cases were followed up 9-65 months, with an average of 26.3 months. Needle tract infection occurred in 4 cases and needle tract loosening occurred in 2 cases after operation, which were improved after symptomatic treatment such as dressing change, Kirschner wire change, and oral antibiotics, and no neurovascular injury occurred in all patients. The external fixator was worn for 3-11 months after operation, with an average of 7.6 months, and the healing index was 43-59 d/cm, with an average of 50.3 d/cm. At last follow-up, the leg was 3-10 cm longer, with an average of 5.5 cm. The varus angles was (1.5+-0.2)  and the KSS score was 93.7+-2.6, which significantly improved when compared with those before operation ( P<0.05). Conclusion: Ilizarov technique is a safe and effective method for the treatment of short limb with genu varus deformity caused by achondroplasia, which can improve the quality of life of patients.",

The aim of this study was to show that TFJ transfixion can be avoided with no impact on patient outcome. All achondroplastic patients undergoing tibia lengthening from 1999 to 2018 were included. Patients were divided in two groups: group A (11 patients) submitted to proximal TFJ transfixion and group B (22 patients) not submitted to TFJ transfixion. The results showed a statistically significant difference in proximal fibular migration (PFM) between the two groups of patients, with a mean PFM of 9.2 mm (range, 1-20 mm) and of 21 mm (range, 2.7-76 mm) in group A and in group B, respectively. We can state that PFM up to 41 mm in our series did not affect joint function and stability. There are no statistically significant differences in the other radiological parameters. Analysis of functional scores (Knee Society, Tegner-Lhysolm, Association for the Study and Application of Methods of Ilizarov) did not reveal significant differences between the groups. The scores of the Achondroplasia Personal Life Experience Scale were also similar in the two groups, demonstrating a good quality of life. There are no differences between the two groups in terms of clinical-functional outcome of the knee, radiographic results, and quality of life. Transfixion of proximal TFJ may not be necessary, but it is important to avoid premature consolidation of the fibular osteotomy.",

We analyzed medical data of 22 adult patients (8 males and 14 females) treated with GH at a dose of 0.05 mg/kg/day. Optionally, tibial lengthening (TL) was performed with the Ilizalov method in 15 patients and TL as well as femoral lengthening (FL) in 6 patients. Concomitant gonadal suppression therapy with buserelin acetate was applied in 13 patients. The mean treatment periods with GH were 10.7 +- 4.0 and 9.3 +- 2.5 years for males and females, respectively. GH treatment augmented the final height +0.60 +- 0.52 SD (+3.5 cm) and +0.51 +- 1.29 SD (+2.8 cm) in males and females compared to non-treated ACH patients, respectively. Final height of ACH patients that underwent GH and TL increased +1.72 +- 0.72 SD (+10.0 cm) and +1.95 +- 1.34 SD (+9.8 cm) in males and females, respectively. GH, TL, and FL increased their final height +2.97 SD (+17.2 cm) and +3.41 +- 1.63 SD (+17.3 cm) in males and females, respectively. Gonadal suppression therapy had no impact on final height.

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Vosoritide is administered as a daily subcutaneous injection in children with achondroplasia. In clinical trials, families of children aged 2-4 years reported difficulty with drug administration due to child fear, pain, and distress. Study aims were to gain a better understanding of the current vosoritide administration experience in this cohort and to investigate whether topical anaesthesia and ice application prior to injections improved the child and family experience. DESIGN AND METHODS: A qualitative descriptive study design ensured in-depth understanding of family experience. Parents were interviewed to explore experience of vosoritide administration for their child at two time points, before (Phase 1) and after (Phase 2) the introduction of topical anaesthesia and ice application prior to injections. Interviews were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Seven families participated. Children's ages ranged from 2 years 2 months to 3 years 11 months. Five themes emerged from data analysis: (1) The reality of the burden of care; (2) Child experience as the greatest obstacle; (3) Parents juggle multiple emotional considerations; (4) Many factors may impact experience; and (5) Short-term and long-term impacts. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of vosoritide in this cohort presents multiple challenges for families. Factors which influenced experience differed between families. Responses to topical anaesthesia and ice application also varied between children, improving administration experience for some children and worsening experience for others. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: This study highlights the need for individualised care for young children receiving daily injections. Support should be provided to families to identify factors that improve experience.",

                    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Vosoritide is the first precision medical therapy approved to increase growth velocity in children with achondroplasia. Sharing early prescribing experiences across different regions could provide a framework for developing practical guidance for the real-world use of vosoritide. METHODS: Two meetings were held to gather insight and early experience from experts in Europe, the Middle East, and the USA. The group comprised geneticists, pediatric endocrinologists, pediatricians, and orthopedic surgeons. Current practices and considerations for vosoritide were discussed, including administration practicalities, assessments, and how to manage expectations. RESULTS: A crucial step in the management of achondroplasia is to determine if adequate multidisciplinary support is in place. Training for families is essential, including practical information on administration of vosoritide, and how to recognize and manage injection-site reactions. Advocated techniques include establishing a routine, empowering patients by allowing them to choose injection sites, and managing pain. Patients may discontinue vosoritide if they cannot tolerate daily injections or are invited to participate in a clinical trial. Clinicians in Europe and the Middle East emphasized the importance of assessing adherence to daily injections, as non-adherence may impact response and reimbursement. Protocols for monitoring patients receiving vosoritide may be influenced by regional differences in reimbursement and healthcare systems. Core assessments may include pubertal staging, anthropometry, radiography to confirm open physes, the review of adverse events, and discussion of concomitant or new medications-but timing of these assessments may also differ regionally and vary across institutions. Patients and families should be informed that response to vosoritide can vary in both magnitude and timing. Keeping families informed regarding vosoritide clinical trial data is encouraged. CONCLUSION: The early real-world experience with vosoritide is generally positive. Sharing these insights is important to increase understanding of the practicalities of treatment with vosoritide in the clinical setting.",

The patient, a 12-year-old boy, had chief complaints of occlusal disturbance and mandibular protrusion. He had been diagnosed with achondroplasia and had growth hormone treatment in his early teenage years. His facial profile was concave with a bulging forehead and a retrognathic maxilla. It was characterized by a skeletal Class III jaw-base relationship with a retropositioned maxilla. At the age of 12 years 9 months, maxillary protraction was initiated with a reverse headgear; for 2 years 6 months, the maxillomandibular growth was controlled. After the growth spurt, at the age of 15 years 6 months, leveling and alignment of both dental arches were started with preadjusted edgewise appliances. After 83 months of multibracket treatment, an acceptable occlusion with a Class I molar relationship and an adequate interincisal relationship was achieved, despite the simultaneous marked vertical growth of the mandible. The resultant occlusion was stable during a 6-year retention period, although considerable forward-downward mandibular growth was observed. Conclusively, our results indicated the necessity of long-term observation in this patient with achondroplasia, especially because of the persistent mandibular growth.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to analyze the long-term results of humeral lengthening in achondroplastic patients and make suggestions on the most appropriate surgical technique to improve patient outcomes. METHODS: Fifty-four humeral lengthening procedures performed in 27 achondroplastic patients were reviewed. Elongations were performed by means of callotasis with unilateral external fixation. Inclusion criteria were: achondroplastic patients under 17 years without prior arm operations and minimum follow-up of 36 months. RESULTS: Fifty humeri in 25 patients (13 men and 12 women), aged between 9 and 17 years, met the inclusion criteria. Mean humeral lengthening was 8.82 cm (range: 5 to 10.5 cm), which represented an elongation of 54.80% (range: 46% to 63%) of the original length. The healing index was 0.91 months (range: 0.72 to 1.4 mo) per centimeter gained. Shoulder and elbow range of motion and stability were preserved in 47 limbs. Noncomplicated cases consistently experienced a significant functional improvement in the performance of activities of daily living such as putting on footwear and personal hygiene. Short-term complications included 11 pin-tract infections, 1 radial nerve neuropraxia, and 1 failure of the regenerated bone formation. None of these complications prevented from completion of treatment. Long-term complications included 2 cases of nonunion, 3 elbow flexion contractures, and 2 cases of psychological dissatisfaction, all of them in 4 patients. Factors associated with long-term complications were intraoperative fragment displacement and distal humeral osteotomy. No fractures of the regenerated bone were identified in the long term. CONCLUSIONS: Callotasis with unilateral external fixation is a reliable and well-tolerated procedure for humeral lengthening in achondroplastic patients, with an acceptable complication rate. Guided fixator placement and a proximal humeral osteotomy are strongly recommended technical tips as they may help prevent complications and improve outcomes.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Many patients with achondroplasia experience functional impairments because of rhizomelic upper extremities (proximal limb shortening). Bilateral humeral lengthening may overcome these functional limitations, but it is associated with several risks, such as radial nerve palsy and insufficient bone regeneration. Only a few studies have reported on patient satisfaction and functional outcome after humeral lengthening in patients with achondroplasia. Furthermore, the reported numbers of adverse events associated with lengthening procedures using external fixators vary widely. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Does bilateral humeral lengthening with a monolateral external fixator in patients with achondroplasia reliably improve patient function and autonomy, and what proportion of patients achieved at least 8 cm of humeral lengthening? (2) What adverse events occur after bilateral humeral lengthening with monolateral external fixators? METHODS: Between 2011 and 2019, 44 patients underwent humeral lengthening at our institution. Humeral lengthening was performed in patients with severe shortening of the upper extremities and functional impairments. In humeri in which intramedullary devices were not applicable, lengthening was performed with monolateral external fixators in 40 patients. Eight patients were excluded because they underwent unilateral lengthening for etiologies other than achondroplasia, and another four patients did not fulfill the minimum study follow-up period of 2 years, leaving 28 patients with bilateral humeral lengthening to treat achondroplasia available for analysis in this retrospective study. The patients had a median (interquartile range) age of 8 years (8 to 10), and 50% (14 of 28) were girls. The median follow-up time was 6 years (4 to 8). The median humeral lengthening was 9 cm (9 to 10) with a median elongation of 73% (67% to 78%) from an initial median length of 12 cm (11 to 13). To determine whether this treatment reliably improved patient function and autonomy, surgeons retrospectively evaluated patient charts. An unvalidated retrospective patient-reported outcome measure questionnaire consisting of nine items (with answers of \"yes\" or \"no\" or a 5-point Likert scale) was administered to assess the patient's functional improvement in activities of daily living, physical appearance, and overall satisfaction, such that 45 points was the highest possible score. The radiographic outcome was assessed on calibrated radiographs of the humerus. To ascertain the proportion of adverse events, study surgeons performed a chart review and telephone interviews. Major complications were defined as events that resulted in unplanned revision surgery, nerve injury (either temporary or permanent), refracture of the bone regenerate, or permanent functional sequelae. Minor complications were characterized as events that resolved without further surgical interventions. RESULTS: On our unvalidated assessment of patient function and independence, all patients reported improvement at their most recent follow-up compared with scores obtained before treatment (median [IQR] 24 [16 to 28] before surgery versus 44 [42 to 45] at latest follow-up, difference of medians 20 points, p < 0.001). A total of 89% (25 of 28) of patients achieved the desired 8 cm of lengthening in both arms. A total of 50% (14 of 28) of our patients experienced a major complication. Specifically, 39% (11 of 28) had an unplanned reoperation, 39% (11 of 28) had a radial nerve palsy, 18% (5 of 28) had a refracture of the regenerate, and 4% (1 of 28) concluded treatment with a severe limb length discrepancy. In addition, 82% (23 of 28) of our patients experienced minor complications that resolved without further surgery and did not involve radial nerve symptoms. Radial nerve palsy was observed immediately postoperatively in eight of 13 segments, and 1 to 7 days postoperatively in five of 13 segments. The treatment goal was not achieved because of radial nerve palsy in 5% (3 of 56) of lengthened segments, which occurred in 7% (2 of 28) of patients. Full functional recovery of the radial nerve was observed in all patients after a median (IQR) of 3 months (2 to 5). Refractures of bone regenerates were observed in 11% (6 of 56) of humeri in 18% (5 of 28) of patients. Of those refractures, 1 of 6 patients was treated nonsurgically with a hanging cast, while 5 of 6 patients underwent revision surgery with intramedullary rodding. CONCLUSION: Most patients with achondroplasia who underwent humeral lengthening achieved the treatment goal without permanent sequelae; nonetheless, complications of treatment were common, and the road to recovery was long and often complicated, with many patients experiencing problems that were either painful (such as refracture) or bothersome (such as temporary radial nerve palsy). However, using a subjective scale, patients seemed improved after treatment; nevertheless, robust outcomes tools are not available for this condition, and so we must interpret that finding with caution. Considering our discoveries, bilateral humeral lengthening with a monolateral external fixator should only be considered in patients with severe functional impairments because of rhizomelic shortening of the upper extremities. If feasible, internal lengthening devices might be preferable, as these are generally associated with higher patient comfort and decreased complication rates compared with external fixators.

A total of 89% (25 of 28) of patients achieved the desired 8 cm of lengthening in both arms. A total of 50% (14 of 28) of our patients experienced a major complication. Specifically, 39% (11 of 28) had an unplanned reoperation, 39% (11 of 28) had a radial nerve palsy, 18% (5 of 28) had a refracture of the regenerate, and 4% (1 of 28) concluded treatment with a severe limb length discrepancy. In addition, 82% (23 of 28) of our patients experienced minor complications that resolved without further surgery and did not involve radial nerve symptoms. Radial nerve palsy was observed immediately postoperatively in eight of 13 segments, and 1 to 7 days postoperatively in five of 13 segments. The treatment goal was not achieved because of radial nerve palsy in 5% (3 of 56) of lengthened segments, which occurred in 7% (2 of 28) of patients. Full functional recovery of the radial nerve was observed in all patients after a median (IQR) of 3 months (2 to 5). Refractures of bone regenerates were observed in 11% (6 of 56) of humeri in 18% (5 of 28) of patients. Of those refractures, 1 of 6 patients was treated nonsurgically with a hanging cast, while 5 of 6 patients underwent revision surgery with intramedullary rodding. CONCLUSION: Most patients with achondroplasia who underwent humeral lengthening achieved the treatment goal without permanent sequelae; nonetheless, complications of treatment were common, and the road to recovery was long and often complicated, with many patients experiencing problems that were either painful (such as refracture) or bothersome (such as temporary radial nerve palsy). However, using a subjective scale, patients seemed improved after treatment; nevertheless, robust outcomes tools are not available for this condition, and so we must interpret that finding with caution. Considering our discoveries, bilateral humeral lengthening with a monolateral external fixator should only be considered in patients with severe functional impairments because of rhizomelic shortening of the upper extremities. If feasible, internal lengthening devices might be preferable, as these are generally associated with higher patient comfort and decreased complication rates compared with external fixators.

Glucocorticoids and physical therapy are the mainstay of treatment. Exercise intolerance is the hallmark of metabolic myopathies, which require a combination of laboratory testing, electrodiagnostic testing, and muscle biopsy for diagnosis. Joint hypermobility may be an isolated finding or be associated with hypermobility Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), other variants of EDS, or marfanoid syndromes. The latter conditions are associated with aortic and cardiac valvular abnormalities. Osteogenesis imperfecta encompasses a group of disorders characterized by bone fragility presenting with a low-impact fracture as a result of minimal trauma. Management includes multidiscipline specialists. Down syndrome (DS), or trisomy 21, is the most common chromosome abnormality identified in live births. Routine evaluation of atlantoaxial instability with x-ray is no longer recommended for children with DS without symptoms of atlantoaxial instability; however, clinical evaluation of symptoms is required for sports preparticipation. Achondroplasia is the most common skeletal dysplasia. Clinical signs are macrocephaly, short limb, short stature with disproportionately shorter humerus and femur, along with characteristic findings in pelvis and lumbar spine x-rays. Caregivers should be educated on proper positioning and handling to avoid complications, including car seat-related deaths.",

We aimed to perform the first study that exclusively analyzed simultaneous bilateral femoral distraction osteogenesis with motorized intramedullary lengthening nails via an antegrade approach in patients with achondroplasia focused on reliability, accuracy, precision, and the evolving complications. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this retrospective singlecenter study we analyzed patients with achondroplasia who underwent simultaneous bilateral femoral lengthening with antegrade intramedullary lengthening nails between October 2014 and April 2019. 15 patients (30 femoral segments) of median age 14 years (interquartile range [IQR] 12-15) were available for analysis. The median follow-up was 29 months (IQR 27-37) after nail implantation. RESULTS: The median distraction length per segment was 49 mm (IQR 47-51) with a median distraction index of 1.0 mm/day (IQR 0.9-1.0), and a median consolidation index of 20 days/cm (IQR 17-23). Reliability of the lengthening nails was 97% and their calculated accuracy and precision were 96% and 95%, respectively. The most common complication was temporary restriction of knee range of motion during distraction in 10 of 30 of the lengthened segments. 1 patient was treated with 2 unplanned additional surgeries due to premature consolidation. CONCLUSION: The method is reliable and accurate with few complications.",

                    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of routine (planned) antenatal nonstress tests (NSTs) in pregnant women with preexisting diabetes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective single-center study of 642 consecutive pregnancies in women with preexisting diabetes who gave birth to a singleton >=22 weeks. Weekly planned NSTs were commenced at 33-35 weeks. In pregnancies with maternal-fetal complications, the initiation and frequency of the planned NST were individualized. Daily maternal assessment of fetal activity was recommended from 28 weeks, and decreased fetal activity indicated an unplanned NST. Data were collected from medical records, and local and regional databases. RESULTS: In total, 3016 planned NSTs were performed, with a median of five (range 0-12) tests per pregnancy. Ninety-five planned NSTs (3.1%) were abnormal, a finding confirmed by retesting the same day in eight cases (8.4%), thus leading to delivery. Complications were present in seven of these eight pregnancies, whereas no fetal movements for the last 3 days were reported when the planned NST was performed in the eighth pregnancy. When specifically asked, five of the eight women stated that they had observed decreased fetal activity preceding the planned NST. In 86 pregnancies (13.4%), maternal perception of decreased fetal activity indicated in total 127 unplanned NSTs. The combination of decreased fetal activity and further obstetrical assessment led to delivery in 10 of these pregnancies (11.6%). One stillbirth occurred at 37 weeks in a pregnancy complicated by fetal achondroplasia and polyhydramnios, where the weekly planned NSTs had been normal. The overall stillbirth rate was thus 1.6/1000. CONCLUSIONS: Routine use of planned antenatal NSTs does not appear to be indicated in pregnancies in women with preexisting diabetes in the absence of maternal-fetal complications.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Many patients with achondroplasia experience functional impairments because of rhizomelic upper extremities (proximal limb shortening). Bilateral humeral lengthening may overcome these functional limitations, but it is associated with several risks, such as radial nerve palsy and insufficient bone regeneration. Only a few studies have reported on patient satisfaction and functional outcome after humeral lengthening in patients with achondroplasia. Furthermore, the reported numbers of adverse events associated with lengthening procedures using external fixators vary widely. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Does bilateral humeral lengthening with a monolateral external fixator in patients with achondroplasia reliably improve patient function and autonomy, and what proportion of patients achieved at least 8 cm of humeral lengthening? (2) What adverse events occur after bilateral humeral lengthening with monolateral external fixators? METHODS: Between 2011 and 2019, 44 patients underwent humeral lengthening at our institution. Humeral lengthening was performed in patients with severe shortening of the upper extremities and functional impairments. In humeri in which intramedullary devices were not applicable, lengthening was performed with monolateral external fixators in 40 patients. Eight patients were excluded because they underwent unilateral lengthening for etiologies other than achondroplasia, and another four patients did not fulfill the minimum study follow-up period of 2 years, leaving 28 patients with bilateral humeral lengthening to treat achondroplasia available for analysis in this retrospective study. The patients had a median (interquartile range) age of 8 years (8 to 10), and 50% (14 of 28) were girls. The median follow-up time was 6 years (4 to 8). The median humeral lengthening was 9 cm (9 to 10) with a median elongation of 73% (67% to 78%) from an initial median length of 12 cm (11 to 13). To determine whether this treatment reliably improved patient function and autonomy, surgeons retrospectively evaluated patient charts. An unvalidated retrospective patient-reported outcome measure questionnaire consisting of nine items (with answers of \"yes\" or \"no\" or a 5-point Likert scale) was administered to assess the patient's functional improvement in activities of daily living, physical appearance, and overall satisfaction, such that 45 points was the highest possible score. The radiographic outcome was assessed on calibrated radiographs of the humerus. To ascertain the proportion of adverse events, study surgeons performed a chart review and telephone interviews. Major complications were defined as events that resulted in unplanned revision surgery, nerve injury (either temporary or permanent), refracture of the bone regenerate, or permanent functional sequelae. Minor complications were characterized as events that resolved without further surgical interventions. RESULTS: On our unvalidated assessment of patient function and independence, all patients reported improvement at their most recent follow-up compared with scores obtained before treatment (median [IQR] 24 [16 to 28] before surgery versus 44 [42 to 45] at latest follow-up, difference of medians 20 points, p < 0.001).

The mean age was ten years (six to 15) and the mean follow-up was 40 months (12 to 104). The mean disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand (DASH) score fell from 32.3 (20 to 40) pre-operatively to 9.4 (6 to 14) post-operatively (p = 0.037). A mean lengthening of 60% (40% to 95%) was required to reach the goal of independent perineal hygiene. One patient developed early consolidation, and fractures occurred in the regenerate bone of four humeri in three patients. There were three transient radial nerve palsies. Humeral lengthening increases the independence of people with achondroplasia and is not just a cosmetic procedure.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Although humeral lengthening in patients with achondroplasia is an accepted procedure for improving functional status, there is still a paucity of information about the effectiveness of the method. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of humeral lengthening using monolateral fixators in patients with achondroplasia and unilateral shortening. METHODS: Twenty-one patients (31 humeri) were included in this study. The study group consisted of eight patients with achondroplasia (16 segments). The control group consisted of 13 patients with post-septic shortening of the humerus (15 segments). All subjects underwent distraction osteogenesis with the use of a monolateral fixator. RESULTS: The mean lengthening in the patients with achondroplasia was 8.29 cm, whereas in the control group it was 7.34 cm (p = 0.1677). The mean lengthening percentage in the patients with achondroplasia (50% of the initial length of the humerus) was significantly greater than in the control group (33% of the initial length of the humerus) (p = 0.0007). The mean healing index was 24.8 days/cm in the patients with achondroplasia and 28.56 days/cm in the control group (p = 0.1832). The overall complication rates for the achondroplastic and post-septic patients were, respectively, 175% and 160% (p = 0.1420). CONCLUSIONS: Humeral lengthening with use of monolateral fixators in patients with achondroplasia is an efficient method. Although the segment lengthening percentage is significantly greater in patients with achondroplasia than in patients with post-septic shortening of the humerus, the safety of this procedure is comparable.",

An admission MRI spine showed a pathological T1 vertebrae fracture with posterior soft tissue extension compressing and distorting the spinal cord. A CT guided biopsy revealed an LCH. Steroids were avoided to reduce osteopenia risk and further vertebral fragility. Considering the risk of a thoracic surgical approach in a child with this background, he was managed conservatively with indomethacin and a Sternal Occipital Mandibular Immobilizer (SOMI) Brace.

There is consensus that infants and children with achondroplasia should be managed by a multidisciplinary team experienced in the condition. However, many people are lost to follow-up after the transition from paediatric to adult care, and there is no standardised approach for management in adults, despite the recent availability of international consensus guidelines. To address this, the European Achondroplasia Forum has developed a patient-held checklist to support adults with achondroplasia in managing their health. The checklist highlights key symptoms of spinal stenosis and obstructive sleep apnoea, both among the most frequent and potentially severe medical complications in adults with achondroplasia. The checklist acts as a framework to support individuals and their primary care provider in completing a routine review. General advice on issues such as blood pressure, pain, hearing, weight, adaptive aids, and psychosocial aspects are also included. The checklist provides key symptoms to be aware of, in addition to action points so that people can approach their primary care provider and be directed to the appropriate specialist, if needed. Additionally, the European Achondroplasia Forum offers some ideas on implementing the checklist during the transition from paediatric to adult care, thus ensuring the existing multidisciplinary team model in place during childhood can support in engaging individuals and empowering them to take responsibility for their own care as they move into adulthood.",

Two variants of the AVF imposition were modeled: with the arrangement of all rods in the same plane, and according to the scheme with a V-shaped arrangement of the rods in the proximal tibia. The values of maximum stresses and values of relative deformations in the elements of the models were investigated. Sweat is a compressive load, the zone of maximum stress (66.8 MPa) in the bone tissue occurs around the upper rod. The smallest stresses (22.8 MPa) are observed around the fourth bar. On the second and third rods, the stresses are the same - 41.6 and 41.5 MPa, respectively. The V-shaped arrangement of the rods leads to a decrease in stresses around the first rod to 57.2 MPa. The stresses in the distal part of the proximal tibia fragment do not exceed 35.5 MPa. Under torsional loads in the model with parallel arrangement of rods, the zone of maximum stresses arises around the first rod (16.3 MPa). The stresses in the distal fragment of the tibia are determined in the range from 1.2 to 3.9 MPa on the lower and upper rods, respectively. The use of an AVF with a V-shaped arrangement of the rods causes stresses in the tibia at a level of 13.1 MPa on the first rod, a minimum 1.1 MPa on the fourth. When the model is compressed with a parallel arrangement of the AVF rods, the values of relative deformations in the bone regenerate are determined in the range from 62 to 85%. The use of the AVF according to the scheme with a V-shaped arrangement of the rods makes it possible to reduce the magnitude of the relative deformations to the level of 77%. In the model with a parallel arrangement of the AVF rods, the relative deformations in the bone regenerate under torsional loads are determined in the range from 3.0 to 6.0%. When using AVF with a V-shaped arrangement of rods, the level of relative deformations is determined in the range from 1.0 to 4.0%. The use of an AVF with a V-shaped arrangement of rods in the lower part of the proximal fragment of the tibia during its osteosynthesis allows reducing the level of stresses at all control points of the model for all types of loading, as compared to the model of an AVF with a parallel arrangement of rods. AVF with a V-shaped arrangement of the rods makes it possible to reduce the values of the relative deformations of the bone regenerate at all the studied control points of the models, both under compression and torsion loads.",

The aim of this study was to show that TFJ transfixion can be avoided with no impact on patient outcome. All achondroplastic patients undergoing tibia lengthening from 1999 to 2018 were included. Patients were divided in two groups: group A (11 patients) submitted to proximal TFJ transfixion and group B (22 patients) not submitted to TFJ transfixion. The results showed a statistically significant difference in proximal fibular migration (PFM) between the two groups of patients, with a mean PFM of 9.2 mm (range, 1-20 mm) and of 21 mm (range, 2.7-76 mm) in group A and in group B, respectively. We can state that PFM up to 41 mm in our series did not affect joint function and stability. There are no statistically significant differences in the other radiological parameters. Analysis of functional scores (Knee Society, Tegner-Lhysolm, Association for the Study and Application of Methods of Ilizarov) did not reveal significant differences between the groups. The scores of the Achondroplasia Personal Life Experience Scale were also similar in the two groups, demonstrating a good quality of life. There are no differences between the two groups in terms of clinical-functional outcome of the knee, radiographic results, and quality of life. Transfixion of proximal TFJ may not be necessary, but it is important to avoid premature consolidation of the fibular osteotomy.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Antegrade intramedullary (IM) nailing for skeletally immature femur fractures can damage the capital femoral epiphysis blood supply, leading to avascular necrosis (AVN) of the femoral head. Reported AVN rates are 2% for piriformis entry and 1.4% for trochanteric entry. None of previous reports described IM lengthening nails for limb lengthening procedures. We have used self-lengthening telescopic nails with a proximal Herzog bend and standard trochanteric entry for femoral lengthening in children. The purpose of this study is to determine whether trochanteric entry IM lengthening nails can be used safely (no AVN or proximal femoral deformity) in the skeletally immature femur. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed between 2004 and 2014 to determine all skeletally immature patients younger than 18 years of age who had a reamed IM lengthening nail inserted through the greater trochanter, with at least 1-year follow-up. RESULTS: Thirty-one femurs were lengthened in 28 patients (17 males and 11 females). The etiology was congenital femoral deficiency (10), achondroplasia (6), post-traumatic (5), hemihypertrophy (3), Ollier disease (2), and miscellaneous (5). An attending surgeon was present for all procedures. Mean age at time of surgery was 12.9 years (range, 7 to 17 y). Mean follow-up was 3.5 years (range, 1.4 to 9 y). The average amount of lengthening was 5.4 cm (range, 3 to 6.7 cm). Twenty-four nails were 10.7 mm in diameter. Seven nails were 12.5 mm in diameter. Intramedullary skeletal kinetic distractor was used in 18 femurs and PRECICE in 13 femurs. Ten segments (7 intramedullary skeletal kinetic distractor; 3 PRECICE) experienced 13 complications. None of the patients developed AVN or proximal femoral deformity. CONCLUSIONS: IM lengthening nails inserted through the greater trochanter may be utilized in skeletally immature patients without increased risk of AVN of the femoral head or proximal femoral deformity. Larger trials would be helpful to confirm our hypothesis. We recommend careful surgical technique with liberal use of the image intensifier to avoid trauma to the femoral head blood supply.

RECENT FINDINGS: The use of multigene panels, using next-generation sequence technology, has improved our ability to quickly identify the genetic etiology, which can impact management. There are successes with the use of growth hormone in individuals with SHOX deficiencies, asfotase alfa in hypophosphatasia, and some promising data for c-type natriuretic peptide for those with achondroplasia. One needs to consider that a patient with short stature has a skeletal dysplasia as options for management may be available.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Antegrade intramedullary (IM) nailing for skeletally immature femur fractures can damage the capital femoral epiphysis blood supply, leading to avascular necrosis (AVN) of the femoral head. Reported AVN rates are 2% for piriformis entry and 1.4% for trochanteric entry. None of previous reports described IM lengthening nails for limb lengthening procedures. We have used self-lengthening telescopic nails with a proximal Herzog bend and standard trochanteric entry for femoral lengthening in children. The purpose of this study is to determine whether trochanteric entry IM lengthening nails can be used safely (no AVN or proximal femoral deformity) in the skeletally immature femur. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed between 2004 and 2014 to determine all skeletally immature patients younger than 18 years of age who had a reamed IM lengthening nail inserted through the greater trochanter, with at least 1-year follow-up. RESULTS: Thirty-one femurs were lengthened in 28 patients (17 males and 11 females). The etiology was congenital femoral deficiency (10), achondroplasia (6), post-traumatic (5), hemihypertrophy (3), Ollier disease (2), and miscellaneous (5). An attending surgeon was present for all procedures. Mean age at time of surgery was 12.9 years (range, 7 to 17 y). Mean follow-up was 3.5 years (range, 1.4 to 9 y). The average amount of lengthening was 5.4 cm (range, 3 to 6.7 cm). Twenty-four nails were 10.7 mm in diameter. Seven nails were 12.5 mm in diameter. Intramedullary skeletal kinetic distractor was used in 18 femurs and PRECICE in 13 femurs. Ten segments (7 intramedullary skeletal kinetic distractor; 3 PRECICE) experienced 13 complications. None of the patients developed AVN or proximal femoral deformity. CONCLUSIONS: IM lengthening nails inserted through the greater trochanter may be utilized in skeletally immature patients without increased risk of AVN of the femoral head or proximal femoral deformity. Larger trials would be helpful to confirm our hypothesis. We recommend careful surgical technique with liberal use of the image intensifier to avoid trauma to the femoral head blood supply.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Use of the Ilizarov technique for limb lengthening in patients with achondroplasia is controversial, with a high risk of complications balancing cosmetic gains. Although several articles have described the complications of this procedure and satisfaction of patients after surgery, it remains unclear whether lengthening improves the quality of life (QOL) of these patients. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked whether bilateral lower limb lengthenings with deformity correction in patients with achondroplasia would improve QOL and investigated the correlation between complication rate and QOL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 22 patients (average age, 12.7 years) diagnosed with achondroplasia who underwent bilateral lower limb lengthenings between 2002 and 2005. These patients were compared with 22 patients with achondroplasia for whom limb lengthening was not performed. The two groups were assessed using the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) lower limb, SF-36, and Rosenberg self-esteem scores. Minimum followup was 4.5 years (range, 4.5-6.9 years). RESULTS: Among the lengthening group, the average gain in length was 10.21 +- 2.39 cm for the femur and 9.13 +- 2.12 cm for the tibia. A total of 123 complications occurred in these 88 segments. The surgical group had higher Rosenberg self-esteem scores than the nonsurgical group although there were no differences in the AAOS and the SF-36 scores. The self-esteem scores decreased with the increase in the number of complications. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that despite frequent complications, bilateral lower limb lengthening increases patients' QOL. We believe lengthening is a reasonable option in selected patients.

                    "abstract": "The main problem in the treatment of axial deformities and limb shortening in pediatric orthopedics is the presence of incomplete growth of the patient, which gives an unfavorable basis for the achieved correction. The most advanced technology for the treatment of deformities and limb shortening is the use of external fixation devices (AVF). Target. To study the stress-strain state of the \"tibia-AVF model with different variants of AVF mounting in conditions of tibia lengthening. Mathematical modeling of tibial osteosynthesis with external fixation devices in children with achondroplasia was carried out. The model of the distal end of the lower limb contained both lower leg bones and bony elements of the foot. Two variants of the AVF imposition were modeled: with the arrangement of all rods in the same plane, and according to the scheme with a V-shaped arrangement of the rods in the proximal tibia. The values of maximum stresses and values of relative deformations in the elements of the models were investigated. Sweat is a compressive load, the zone of maximum stress (66.8 MPa) in the bone tissue occurs around the upper rod. The smallest stresses (22.8 MPa) are observed around the fourth bar. On the second and third rods, the stresses are the same - 41.6 and 41.5 MPa, respectively. The V-shaped arrangement of the rods leads to a decrease in stresses around the first rod to 57.2 MPa. The stresses in the distal part of the proximal tibia fragment do not exceed 35.5 MPa. Under torsional loads in the model with parallel arrangement of rods, the zone of maximum stresses arises around the first rod (16.3 MPa). The stresses in the distal fragment of the tibia are determined in the range from 1.2 to 3.9 MPa on the lower and upper rods, respectively. The use of an AVF with a V-shaped arrangement of the rods causes stresses in the tibia at a level of 13.1 MPa on the first rod, a minimum 1.1 MPa on the fourth. When the model is compressed with a parallel arrangement of the AVF rods, the values of relative deformations in the bone regenerate are determined in the range from 62 to 85%. The use of the AVF according to the scheme with a V-shaped arrangement of the rods makes it possible to reduce the magnitude of the relative deformations to the level of 77%. In the model with a parallel arrangement of the AVF rods, the relative deformations in the bone regenerate under torsional loads are determined in the range from 3.0 to 6.0%. When using AVF with a V-shaped arrangement of rods, the level of relative deformations is determined in the range from 1.0 to 4.0%. The use of an AVF with a V-shaped arrangement of rods in the lower part of the proximal fragment of the tibia during its osteosynthesis allows reducing the level of stresses at all control points of the model for all types of loading, as compared to the model of an AVF with a parallel arrangement of rods. AVF with a V-shaped arrangement of the rods makes it possible to reduce the values of the relative deformations of the bone regenerate at all the studied control points of the models, both under compression and torsion loads.",

Vosoritide is a C-natriuretic peptide analogue that has been shown to improve endochondral ossification in children with achondroplasia. The objective of this trial is to evaluate the safety of vosoritide and whether vosoritide can improve the growth of the foramen magnum and spinal canal in children that may require decompression surgery. An Achondroplasia Foramen Magnum Score will be used to identify infants at risk of requiring decompression surgery. This is a 2-year open label randomized controlled trial of vosoritide in infants with achondroplasia ages 0 to <=12 months. Approximately 20 infants will be randomized 1:1 to either open label once daily subcutaneous vosoritide combined with standard of care or standard of care alone. The primary and secondary aims of the study are to evaluate the safety and efficacy of vosoritide in children with cervicomedullary compression at risk of requiring decompression surgery. The trial will be carried out in specialized skeletal dysplasia treatment centers with well established multidisciplinary care pathways and standardized approaches to the neurosurgical management of cervicomedually compression. After 2 years, infants randomized to standard of care alone will be eligible to switch to vosoritide plus standard of care for an additional 3 years. This pioneering trial hopes to address the important question as to whether treatment with vosoritide at an early age in infants at risk of requiring cervicomedullary decompression surgery is safe, and can improve growth at the foramen magnum and spinal canal alleviating stenosis. This in turn may reduce compression of surrounding structures including the neuraxis and spinal cord, which could alleviate future morbidity and mortality.Trial registrations: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04554940; EudraCT number, 2020-001055-40.",

Due to a shortage of hospital beds and economic constraints, we started a program for outpatient initiation of CPAP in selected children with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). METHODS: Objective CPAP compliance and efficacy were evaluated in consecutive children enrolled in an outpatient CPAP program when they fulfilled the following criteria: persistent OSA, age >6 months, stable condition, family living in the Parisian area and agreeing with a regular follow-up. RESULTS: Thirty-one children, median (range) age 8.9 years (0.8-17.5), were included in the program. The most common diagnosis were Down syndrome (n = 7), achondroplasia (n = 3), and obesity (n = 3). Median baseline obstructive apnea-hypopnea index (OAHI) was 12.5 events/h (5-100). Median duration of follow-up was 12.3 months (2.2-25.2). Four subjects (three adolescents with Down syndrome) were not compliant at 2-month follow-up with a compliance <4 h/night. In the other 27 subjects, median compliance was 08:21 h:min/night (05:45-12:20), with a median number of night use per month of 25 (18-30). CPAP efficacy at the end of follow-up was excellent in the compliant subjects with a median AHI of two events/h (0-4) and normal gas exchange with CPAP therapy. Three subjects were successfully weaned from CPAP treatment during the study period. CONCLUSION: Initiating CPAP in an outpatient setting in children is feasible and effective in selected subjects. A high rate of compliance can be achieved as well as a correction of OSA.",

However, many people are lost to follow-up after the transition from paediatric to adult care, and there is no standardised approach for management in adults, despite the recent availability of international consensus guidelines. To address this, the European Achondroplasia Forum has developed a patient-held checklist to support adults with achondroplasia in managing their health. The checklist highlights key symptoms of spinal stenosis and obstructive sleep apnoea, both among the most frequent and potentially severe medical complications in adults with achondroplasia. The checklist acts as a framework to support individuals and their primary care provider in completing a routine review. General advice on issues such as blood pressure, pain, hearing, weight, adaptive aids, and psychosocial aspects are also included. The checklist provides key symptoms to be aware of, in addition to action points so that people can approach their primary care provider and be directed to the appropriate specialist, if needed. Additionally, the European Achondroplasia Forum offers some ideas on implementing the checklist during the transition from paediatric to adult care, thus ensuring the existing multidisciplinary team model in place during childhood can support in engaging individuals and empowering them to take responsibility for their own care as they move into adulthood.",

Methods: The clinical data of 38 patients with lower limb deformity caused by achondroplasia treated by Ilizarov technique between February 2014 and September 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. There were 18 males and 20 females, the age ranged from 7 to 34 years, with an average of 14.8 years. All patients presented with bilateral knee varus deformity. The preoperative varus angles was (15.2+-4.2) , and knee society score (KSS) was 61.8+-7.2. Nine of these patients underwent tibia and fibula osteotomy, 29 cases underwent tibia and fibula osteotomy and bone lengthening at the same time. Full-length bearing position X-ray films of bilateral lower limbs were taken to measure the bilateral varus angles, analyze the healing index, and record the occurrence of complications. KSS score was used to evaluate the improvement of knee joint function before and after operation. Results: All 38 cases were followed up 9-65 months, with an average of 26.3 months. Needle tract infection occurred in 4 cases and needle tract loosening occurred in 2 cases after operation, which were improved after symptomatic treatment such as dressing change, Kirschner wire change, and oral antibiotics, and no neurovascular injury occurred in all patients. The external fixator was worn for 3-11 months after operation, with an average of 7.6 months, and the healing index was 43-59 d/cm, with an average of 50.3 d/cm. At last follow-up, the leg was 3-10 cm longer, with an average of 5.5 cm. The varus angles was (1.5+-0.2)  and the KSS score was 93.7+-2.6, which significantly improved when compared with those before operation ( P<0.05). Conclusion: Ilizarov technique is a safe and effective method for the treatment of short limb with genu varus deformity caused by achondroplasia, which can improve the quality of life of patients.",

Respiratory failure is responsible for most deaths among these children and is often related to cervicomedullary compression (CMC). We present our experience with early cervicomedullary decompression in infants with achondroplasia. METHODS: Data was retrospectively collected for infants with achondroplasia who underwent CMC decompression between 1998 and 2013. Data included presurgical and postsurgical neurological examinations, MRI scans, and sleep study results. RESULTS: Ten infants were included. Ages at surgery were 4 to 23 months (12.5 +- 6.88 months). All infants displayed neurological findings prior to surgery, although often subtle. All infants underwent a foramen magnum opening with a wide C1 laminectomy. Following surgery, seven patients (70 %) demonstrated improved neurological status, and one displayed neurological deterioration. Seven patients demonstrated improved sleep quality 1 year after surgery. These patients had a good or improved neurological status following surgery. Preoperative radiological findings included abnormal hyperintense T2 changes in all children (improved following surgery in six children), brainstem distortion in four children (improved in all), and diminished cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) spaces at the level of the foramen magnum in eight children (improved in seven). One child with extensive preoperative T2 changes accompanied by neurological and respiratory decline, deteriorated following surgery, and remains chronically ventilated.

The challenges encountered during surgical procedures and perioperative care for achondroplastic individuals, are underrepresented in the existing literature. CASE PRESENTATION: In this report, the management of a 26-year-old North-African achondroplastic male is highlighted. The patient suffered a complete intra-articular distal femur fracture (AO/OTA 33-C1) and an ipsilateral patella fracture (AO/OTA 34-C1). The patient's unusual anatomical variations and the lack of suitable orthopedic implants posed significant surgical challenges, particularly in the context of a resource-limited developing country. Facial and spinal deformities, which are common in patients with achondroplasia, further complicated the anesthetic approach. CONCLUSIONS: The limited information on operative management of fractures in achondroplastic patients necessitated independent decision-making and diverging from the convenient approach where clear guidance is available in the literature.",

The challenges encountered during surgical procedures and perioperative care for achondroplastic individuals, are underrepresented in the existing literature. CASE PRESENTATION: In this report, the management of a 26-year-old North-African achondroplastic male is highlighted. The patient suffered a complete intra-articular distal femur fracture (AO/OTA 33-C1) and an ipsilateral patella fracture (AO/OTA 34-C1). The patient's unusual anatomical variations and the lack of suitable orthopedic implants posed significant surgical challenges, particularly in the context of a resource-limited developing country. Facial and spinal deformities, which are common in patients with achondroplasia, further complicated the anesthetic approach. CONCLUSIONS: The limited information on operative management of fractures in achondroplastic patients necessitated independent decision-making and diverging from the convenient approach where clear guidance is available in the literature.",

Cases of achondroplasia and screening and surgery claims were identified using a combination of International Classification of Diseases diagnosis codes and Current Procedural Terminology codes. American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) practice guidelines were used to determine screening trends.RESULTSThe search yielded 3577 children age 19 years or younger with achondroplasia. Of them, 236 met criteria for inclusion in the screening analysis. Among the screening cohort, 41.9% received some form of screening for foramen magnum stenosis, whereas 13.9% of patients were fully and appropriately screened according to the 2005 guidelines from the AAP. The screening rate significantly increased after the issuance of the AAP guidelines. Among all children in the cohort, 25 underwent cervicomedullary decompression for foramen magnum stenosis. The incidence rate of undergoing cervicomedullary decompression was highest in infancy (28 per 1000 patient-years) and decreased with age (5 per 1000 patient-years for all other ages combined).CONCLUSIONSChildren with achondroplasia continue to be underscreened for foramen magnum stenosis, although screening rates have improved since the release of the 2005 AAP surveillance guidelines. The incidence of surgery was highest in infants and decreased with age.",

We are reporting the first case of a patient with Down syndrome and hypochondroplasia. In this patient, Down syndrome was clinically recognised and confirmed by the cytogenetic finding of mosaic karyotype (47,XX,+21/46,XX) shortly after birth. She was subsequently diagnosed with hypochondroplasia at the age of 6 years when disproportional short stature, stocky habitus and macrocephaly were observed. These phenotypic findings were later confirmed by the presence of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene mutation N540K. The overlapping common clinical features of Down syndrome and hypochondroplasia resulted in delayed diagnosis of hypochondroplasia in our patient and the associated deleterious effect on her linear growth. Her final height is 126.5 cm, which is -3.76 standard deviations (SD) lower than the median height in patients with Down syndrome, and is under the lower borderline of the adult height range for women with hypochondroplasia.",

Joint hypermobility may be an isolated finding or be associated with hypermobility Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), other variants of EDS, or marfanoid syndromes. The latter conditions are associated with aortic and cardiac valvular abnormalities. Osteogenesis imperfecta encompasses a group of disorders characterized by bone fragility presenting with a low-impact fracture as a result of minimal trauma. Management includes multidiscipline specialists. Down syndrome (DS), or trisomy 21, is the most common chromosome abnormality identified in live births. Routine evaluation of atlantoaxial instability with x-ray is no longer recommended for children with DS without symptoms of atlantoaxial instability; however, clinical evaluation of symptoms is required for sports preparticipation. Achondroplasia is the most common skeletal dysplasia. Clinical signs are macrocephaly, short limb, short stature with disproportionately shorter humerus and femur, along with characteristic findings in pelvis and lumbar spine x-rays.

There is consensus that infants and children with achondroplasia should be managed by a multidisciplinary team experienced in the condition. However, many people are lost to follow-up after the transition from paediatric to adult care, and there is no standardised approach for management in adults, despite the recent availability of international consensus guidelines. To address this, the European Achondroplasia Forum has developed a patient-held checklist to support adults with achondroplasia in managing their health. The checklist highlights key symptoms of spinal stenosis and obstructive sleep apnoea, both among the most frequent and potentially severe medical complications in adults with achondroplasia. The checklist acts as a framework to support individuals and their primary care provider in completing a routine review. General advice on issues such as blood pressure, pain, hearing, weight, adaptive aids, and psychosocial aspects are also included. The checklist provides key symptoms to be aware of, in addition to action points so that people can approach their primary care provider and be directed to the appropriate specialist, if needed. Additionally, the European Achondroplasia Forum offers some ideas on implementing the checklist during the transition from paediatric to adult care, thus ensuring the existing multidisciplinary team model in place during childhood can support in engaging individuals and empowering them to take responsibility for their own care as they move into adulthood.",

The incidence of infection during treatment is high. Hydrotherapy is highly beneficial during external fixation management, but the infection rates may impact its utilization. The objective of this paper is to document the incidence and duration of infection in patients who participated in a full hydrotherapy program when performed under medical supervision and in accordance with strict follow-up protocols. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we documented the key characteristics of patients who participated in hydrotherapy after lower limb external fixation surgery including age, sex, diagnosis and surgery site, the incidence and duration of pin site infections, and the percentage of cases, which were able to comply with a full hydrotherapy protocol. RESULTS: The hydrotherapy pool met all daily water quality metrics. Thirty-four children (19 males and 15 females) had a mean+-SD age of 10.9+-4.6 years. Of the cases, 80% were unilateral and 20% were bilateral.

RESULTS: Information from one thousand three hundred and seventy-four patients with achondroplasia were included in this study. Four hundred and eight (29.7%) patients had at least one orthopedic surgery during their lifetime and 299 (21.8%) patients underwent multiple procedures. 12.7% (n = 175) of patients underwent spine surgery at a mean age at first surgery of 22.4 +- 15.3 years old. The median age was 16.7 years old (0.1-67.4). 21.2% (n = 291) of patients underwent lower extremity surgery at a mean age at first surgery of 9.9 +- 8.3 years old with a median age of 8.2 years (0.2-57.8). The most common spinal procedure was decompression (152 patients underwent 271 laminectomy procedures), while the most common lower extremity procedure was osteotomy (200 patients underwent 434 procedures). Fifty-eight (4.2%) patients had both a spine and lower extremity surgery. Specific risk factors increasing the likelihood of orthopedic surgery included: patients with hydrocephalus requiring shunt placement having higher odds of undergoing spine surgery (OR 1.97, 95% CI 1.14-3.26); patients having a cervicomedullary decompression also had higher odds of undergoing spine surgery (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.30-2.63); and having lower extremity surgery increased the odds of spine surgery (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.45-2.90). CONCLUSIONS: Orthopedic surgery was a common occurrence in achondroplasia with 29.7% of patients undergoing at least one orthopedic procedure. Spine surgery (12.7%) was less common and occurred at a later age than lower extremity surgery (21.2%). Cervicomedullary decompression and hydrocephalus with shunt placement were associated with an increased risk for spine surgery. The results from CLARITY, the largest natural history study of achondroplasia, should aid clinicians in counseling patients and families about orthopedic surgery.",

Methods: The clinical data of 38 patients with lower limb deformity caused by achondroplasia treated by Ilizarov technique between February 2014 and September 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. There were 18 males and 20 females, the age ranged from 7 to 34 years, with an average of 14.8 years. All patients presented with bilateral knee varus deformity. The preoperative varus angles was (15.2+-4.2) , and knee society score (KSS) was 61.8+-7.2. Nine of these patients underwent tibia and fibula osteotomy, 29 cases underwent tibia and fibula osteotomy and bone lengthening at the same time. Full-length bearing position X-ray films of bilateral lower limbs were taken to measure the bilateral varus angles, analyze the healing index, and record the occurrence of complications. KSS score was used to evaluate the improvement of knee joint function before and after operation. Results: All 38 cases were followed up 9-65 months, with an average of 26.3 months. Needle tract infection occurred in 4 cases and needle tract loosening occurred in 2 cases after operation, which were improved after symptomatic treatment such as dressing change, Kirschner wire change, and oral antibiotics, and no neurovascular injury occurred in all patients. The external fixator was worn for 3-11 months after operation, with an average of 7.6 months, and the healing index was 43-59 d/cm, with an average of 50.3 d/cm. At last follow-up, the leg was 3-10 cm longer, with an average of 5.5 cm. The varus angles was (1.5+-0.2)  and the KSS score was 93.7+-2.6, which significantly improved when compared with those before operation ( P<0.05). Conclusion: Ilizarov technique is a safe and effective method for the treatment of short limb with genu varus deformity caused by achondroplasia, which can improve the quality of life of patients.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Although humeral lengthening in patients with achondroplasia is an accepted procedure for improving functional status, there is still a paucity of information about the effectiveness of the method. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of humeral lengthening using monolateral fixators in patients with achondroplasia and unilateral shortening. METHODS: Twenty-one patients (31 humeri) were included in this study. The study group consisted of eight patients with achondroplasia (16 segments). The control group consisted of 13 patients with post-septic shortening of the humerus (15 segments). All subjects underwent distraction osteogenesis with the use of a monolateral fixator. RESULTS: The mean lengthening in the patients with achondroplasia was 8.29 cm, whereas in the control group it was 7.34 cm (p = 0.1677). The mean lengthening percentage in the patients with achondroplasia (50% of the initial length of the humerus) was significantly greater than in the control group (33% of the initial length of the humerus) (p = 0.0007). The mean healing index was 24.8 days/cm in the patients with achondroplasia and 28.56 days/cm in the control group (p = 0.1832). The overall complication rates for the achondroplastic and post-septic patients were, respectively, 175% and 160% (p = 0.1420). CONCLUSIONS: Humeral lengthening with use of monolateral fixators in patients with achondroplasia is an efficient method. Although the segment lengthening percentage is significantly greater in patients with achondroplasia than in patients with post-septic shortening of the humerus, the safety of this procedure is comparable.",

                    "abstract": "Achondroplasia (ACH) is the prototype and most common of the human chondrodysplasias. It results from gain-of-function mutations that exaggerate the signal output of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3), a receptor tyrosine kinase that negatively regulates growth plate activity and linear bone growth. Several approaches to reduce FGFR3 signaling by blocking receptor activation or inhibiting downstream signals have been proposed. Five show promise in preclinical mouse studies. Two candidate therapies target the extracellular domain of FGFR3. The first is a decoy receptor that competes for activating ligands. The second is a synthetic blocking peptide that prevents ligands from binding and activating FGFR3. Two established drugs, statins and meclozine, improve growth of ACH mice. The strongest candidate therapy employs an analog of C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), which antagonizes the mitogen-activated-protein (MAP) kinase pathway downstream of the FGFR3 receptor and may also act independently in the growth plate. Only the CNP analog has reached clinical trials. Preliminary results of Phase 2 studies show a substantial increase in growth rate of ACH children after six months of therapy with no serious adverse effects. A challenge for drug therapy in ACH is targeting agents to the avascular growth plate. The application of gene therapy in osteoarthritis offers insights because it faces similar technical obstacles. Major advances in gene therapy include the emergence of recombinant adeno-associated virus as the vector of choice, capsid engineering to target vectors to specific tissues, and development of methods to direct vectors to articular chondrocytes.

CLARITY (The Achondroplasia Natural History Study) includes clinical data from achondroplasia patients receiving treatment at four skeletal dysplasia centers in the United States from 1957 to 2018. Data were entered and stored in a Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) database. RESULTS: Information from one thousand three hundred and seventy-four patients with achondroplasia were included in this study. Four hundred and eight (29.7%) patients had at least one orthopedic surgery during their lifetime and 299 (21.8%) patients underwent multiple procedures. 12.7% (n = 175) of patients underwent spine surgery at a mean age at first surgery of 22.4 +- 15.3 years old. The median age was 16.7 years old (0.1-67.4). 21.2% (n = 291) of patients underwent lower extremity surgery at a mean age at first surgery of 9.9 +- 8.3 years old with a median age of 8.2 years (0.2-57.8). The most common spinal procedure was decompression (152 patients underwent 271 laminectomy procedures), while the most common lower extremity procedure was osteotomy (200 patients underwent 434 procedures). Fifty-eight (4.2%) patients had both a spine and lower extremity surgery. Specific risk factors increasing the likelihood of orthopedic surgery included: patients with hydrocephalus requiring shunt placement having higher odds of undergoing spine surgery (OR 1.97, 95% CI 1.14-3.26); patients having a cervicomedullary decompression also had higher odds of undergoing spine surgery (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.30-2.63); and having lower extremity surgery increased the odds of spine surgery (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.45-2.90). CONCLUSIONS: Orthopedic surgery was a common occurrence in achondroplasia with 29.7% of patients undergoing at least one orthopedic procedure. Spine surgery (12.7%) was less common and occurred at a later age than lower extremity surgery (21.2%). Cervicomedullary decompression and hydrocephalus with shunt placement were associated with an increased risk for spine surgery. The results from CLARITY, the largest natural history study of achondroplasia, should aid clinicians in counseling patients and families about orthopedic surgery.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Achondroplasia typically results in compressive spinal canal stenosis in one-third of children, but rare under the age of 15 years. Laminectomy is the mainstay of treatment but this leads to instability and progressive deformity requiring complex fixation. In order to reduce that risk, we developed a novel modified augmented laminoplasty that increases spinal canal diameter while preserving the posterior column stability. METHODS: All laminoplasty cases for spinal compressive achondroplasia from 2006 to 2020 were included. Ten augmentation laminoplasty procedures were performed in 7 children with regular clinical and radiological post-operative follow-up. Kyphotic deformity and clinical outcomes (neurological and urological) were evaluated. RESULTS: At presentation, clinical features included radiculopathy, neurogenic claudication or acute cauda equina compression with sphincter dysfunction. The average age at initial surgery was 11.2 (range 5-16) with a mean follow-up of 5 (range 2-8) years. All patients demonstrated improvement in neurogenic claudication symptoms after surgery; however, bladder dysfunction persisted in some children. In one child, cervical and lumbar augmentation laminoplasties were performed for concomitant disease. Augmentation laminoplasty effectively prevented deformity progression over time in all cases except one where a further revision laminoplasty with extension was required for screw loosening. Despite this, progressive symptomatic kyphotic deformity led to a 360  fixation. Minor complications included one dural breach (repaired intraoperatively) and one superficial wound infection. CONCLUSION: Augmentation laminoplasty is a viable surgical option following laminectomy in achondroplasia patients as an alternative to surgical fixation. Fixation can be reserved for cases where there is progressive deformity and kyphosis.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Pediatric achondroplasia is often associated with conditions requiring neurosurgical intervention, including CSF diversion and multilevel spinal decompression. However, there is a lack of clinical guidelines and reliable estimates of the benefits and risks of these interventions. This study aimed to summarize the literature on the neurosurgical management of pediatric achondroplasia patients in order to aid in determining optimal treatment and standardization of care. METHODS: A systematic review of peer-reviewed studies with an objective diagnosis of achondroplasia, patient demographic information, and available data on neurosurgical interventions performed before 18 years of age for cervicomedullary compression, spinal stenosis, and hydrocephalus was performed. Study quality and risks of bias were assessed using standardized scores. Independent patient data on surgical indications, outcomes, reoperations, and complication risks were aggregated using means and percentages. RESULTS: Of 204 records, 25 studies with 287 pediatric achondroplasia patients (mean age 25 +- 36 months) treated for cervicomedullary compression (n = 153), spinal stenosis (n = 100), and obstructive hydrocephalus (n = 34) were evaluated. Symptomatic cervicomedullary compression occurred early in life (mean age 31 +- 25 months), with apnea (48%), T2-weighted MRI cord signal (28%), myelopathy (27%), and delayed motor skills (15%) requiring foramen magnum decompression observed in 99% of patients, as well as cervical laminectomy in 65% of patients. Although 91% of treated patients had resolution of symptoms, 2% mortality, 9% reoperation, and 21% complication rates were reported. Spinal stenosis was treated in relatively older children (mean age 13 +- 3 years) with laminectomy (23%), as well as with instrumented fusion (73%) for neurogenic claudication (59%), back pain (15%), and sciatica (8%). Although 95% of patients had symptom resolution after surgery, 17% reported complications and 18% required reoperation. Of the hydrocephalus patients (mean age 56 +- 103 months), half were treated with endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) and half had a shunt placed for progressive ventriculomegaly (66%), headaches (32%), and delayed cognitive development (4%). The shunted patients had a 3% mortality rate and an average of 1.5 shunt revisions per patient. None of the patients who underwent ETV as the primary procedure required a revision. CONCLUSIONS: Neurosurgical intervention for pediatric achondroplasia conditions, including cervicomedullary compression, spinal stenosis, and hydrocephalus, is associated with high recovery rates and good outcomes. However, complications and reoperations are common. Further studies with follow-up into adulthood are needed to evaluate the long-term outcomes.",

There was 1 complication of instability from an iatrogenic pars fracture, which required reoperation and posterior instrumented fusion. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this report represents the first surgical series of pediatric neurogenic claudication associated with posterior vertebral rim fractures. Pediatric neurosurgeons may infrequently encounter neurogenic claudication associated with a posterior vertebral rim fracture in children. To treat children with neurogenic claudication associated with posterior vertebral rim fractures, a simple laminectomy may be a safe and efficacious alternative to discectomy and removal of fracture fragments.",

Neurogenic claudication associated with posterior vertebral rim fracture is even more uncommon but nonetheless causes pain and disability in affected children and adolescents. The purpose of this study was to describe the surgical results of 3 adolescents presenting with neurogenic claudication and posterior vertebral rim fracture when treated with laminectomy alone. METHODS: The medical and operative records of the 3 pediatric patients were retrospectively reviewed. Presenting signs and symptoms and CT findings, such as the interpedicular distances between T-12 and L-5, were obtained. Perioperative results were assessed, including operative time, blood loss, length of hospital stay, and complications. Findings at latest follow-up were also recorded, including a patient satisfaction survey. RESULTS: The 3 patients (1 girl and 2 boys) had a mean age of 14.7 years (range 14-15 years) and underwent follow-up for a mean of 11.3 months (range 5-18 months). Notable preoperative signs and symptoms included back pain (all patients), leg pain (all patients), leg numbness (1 patient), and leg weakness (1 patient). No patient presented with bowel and/or bladder dysfunction. The mean blood loss during laminectomy was 123 ml (range 20-300 ml), and the mean length of hospital stay was 4.3 days (range 3-6 days).

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Pediatric achondroplasia is often associated with conditions requiring neurosurgical intervention, including CSF diversion and multilevel spinal decompression. However, there is a lack of clinical guidelines and reliable estimates of the benefits and risks of these interventions. This study aimed to summarize the literature on the neurosurgical management of pediatric achondroplasia patients in order to aid in determining optimal treatment and standardization of care. METHODS: A systematic review of peer-reviewed studies with an objective diagnosis of achondroplasia, patient demographic information, and available data on neurosurgical interventions performed before 18 years of age for cervicomedullary compression, spinal stenosis, and hydrocephalus was performed. Study quality and risks of bias were assessed using standardized scores. Independent patient data on surgical indications, outcomes, reoperations, and complication risks were aggregated using means and percentages. RESULTS: Of 204 records, 25 studies with 287 pediatric achondroplasia patients (mean age 25 +- 36 months) treated for cervicomedullary compression (n = 153), spinal stenosis (n = 100), and obstructive hydrocephalus (n = 34) were evaluated. Symptomatic cervicomedullary compression occurred early in life (mean age 31 +- 25 months), with apnea (48%), T2-weighted MRI cord signal (28%), myelopathy (27%), and delayed motor skills (15%) requiring foramen magnum decompression observed in 99% of patients, as well as cervical laminectomy in 65% of patients. Although 91% of treated patients had resolution of symptoms, 2% mortality, 9% reoperation, and 21% complication rates were reported. Spinal stenosis was treated in relatively older children (mean age 13 +- 3 years) with laminectomy (23%), as well as with instrumented fusion (73%) for neurogenic claudication (59%), back pain (15%), and sciatica (8%). Although 95% of patients had symptom resolution after surgery, 17% reported complications and 18% required reoperation. Of the hydrocephalus patients (mean age 56 +- 103 months), half were treated with endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) and half had a shunt placed for progressive ventriculomegaly (66%), headaches (32%), and delayed cognitive development (4%). The shunted patients had a 3% mortality rate and an average of 1.5 shunt revisions per patient. None of the patients who underwent ETV as the primary procedure required a revision. CONCLUSIONS: Neurosurgical intervention for pediatric achondroplasia conditions, including cervicomedullary compression, spinal stenosis, and hydrocephalus, is associated with high recovery rates and good outcomes. However, complications and reoperations are common. Further studies with follow-up into adulthood are needed to evaluate the long-term outcomes.",

                    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Vosoritide is the first precision medical therapy approved to increase growth velocity in children with achondroplasia. Sharing early prescribing experiences across different regions could provide a framework for developing practical guidance for the real-world use of vosoritide. METHODS: Two meetings were held to gather insight and early experience from experts in Europe, the Middle East, and the USA. The group comprised geneticists, pediatric endocrinologists, pediatricians, and orthopedic surgeons. Current practices and considerations for vosoritide were discussed, including administration practicalities, assessments, and how to manage expectations. RESULTS: A crucial step in the management of achondroplasia is to determine if adequate multidisciplinary support is in place. Training for families is essential, including practical information on administration of vosoritide, and how to recognize and manage injection-site reactions. Advocated techniques include establishing a routine, empowering patients by allowing them to choose injection sites, and managing pain. Patients may discontinue vosoritide if they cannot tolerate daily injections or are invited to participate in a clinical trial. Clinicians in Europe and the Middle East emphasized the importance of assessing adherence to daily injections, as non-adherence may impact response and reimbursement. Protocols for monitoring patients receiving vosoritide may be influenced by regional differences in reimbursement and healthcare systems. Core assessments may include pubertal staging, anthropometry, radiography to confirm open physes, the review of adverse events, and discussion of concomitant or new medications-but timing of these assessments may also differ regionally and vary across institutions. Patients and families should be informed that response to vosoritide can vary in both magnitude and timing. Keeping families informed regarding vosoritide clinical trial data is encouraged. CONCLUSION: The early real-world experience with vosoritide is generally positive. Sharing these insights is important to increase understanding of the practicalities of treatment with vosoritide in the clinical setting.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Automated bladder scanning has become a principal tool in the assessment and management of chronically debilitated patients residing in skilled nursing facilities, hospices, and acute inpatient settings. To a large extent, the bladder scan, generally performed by nursing staff, has replaced physical examination while addressing the differential diagnoses of anuria or voiding disturbances that require consideration of urinary catheterization. Health care providers can quickly master this easily performed technique, and currently, due to confidence in the bladder scan finding, physical examination with suprapubic palpation and percussion may be carelessly omitted. The case description presented here illustrates how not performing a physical examination can lead to misdiagnosis caused by misinterpretation of bladder scan findings. CASE REPORT A 66-year-old, quadriparetic, chronically ventilated female patient with achondroplasia underwent repeated hospital referrals and bladder catheterizations for presumed flaccid, neurogenic bladder with urinary retention. This postulated diagnosis was based on occasional reports of urinary catheter obstruction as well as on automated bladder scanning indicating a markedly distended bladder. However, the bladder could not be drained by insertion of urinary catheters. Eventually, a proper physical examination excluded the presence of suprapubic fullness compatible with distended bladder and contradicting bladder scan findings, prompting re-examining an overlooked evaluation of computed tomography that reported a huge ovarian cyst. The patient was found to have intact voiding capabilities and is now weaned from the catheter. CONCLUSIONS This case and the literature review underscore drawbacks in automated bladder scanning. This technique should be used as an adjunctive measure rather than a replacement for a physical examination in the evaluation of voiding disturbances, especially when there are discrepancies between bladder scan findings and the volume of urine drained by catheterization.",

                    "abstract": "Achondroplasia (ACH) is the most common short-limbed skeletal dysplasia caused by activating mutations in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene. We identified that meclizine hydrochloride inhibited FGFR3 signaling in various chondrocytic cells and promoted longitudinal bone growth in mouse model of ACH. Meclizine has safely been used for more than 50 years, but it lacks the safety data for repeated administration and pharmacokinetics (PK) when administered to children. We performed a phase Ia study to evaluate the PK and safety of meclizine administered orally to ACH children. Twelve ACH children aged from 5 to younger than 11 years were recruited, and the first 6 subjects received once a day of meclizine in the fasted condition, subsequent 6 subjects received twice a day of meclizine in the fed condition. Meclizine was well tolerated in ACH children with no serious adverse events. The mean Cmax, Tmax, AUC0-24h, t1/2 during 24 hours in the fasted condition were 130 ng/mL, 1.7 hours, 761 ng h/mL, and 8.5 hours respectively. The simulation of repeated administration of meclizine for 14 days demonstrated that plasma concentration apparently reached steady state around 10 days after the first dose both at once a day and twice a day administration. The AUC0-10h of the fasting and fed condition were 504 ng h/mL and 813 ng h/mL, respectively, indicating exposure of meclizine increased with the diet. Although higher drug exposure was confirmed in ACH children compared to adults, a single administration of meclizine seemed to be well tolerated.",
