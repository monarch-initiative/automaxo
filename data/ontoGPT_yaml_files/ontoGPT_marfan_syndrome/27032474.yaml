input_text: 'Personalized external aortic root support: a review of the current status.Personalized
  external aortic root support (PEARS) is an emerging technology. It is a pre-emptive
  operation to halt aortic root expansion and maintain aortic valve function in Marfan
  syndrome and is also applicable to aortic root aneurysms of other aetiologies. To
  fully evaluate PEARS, awareness of all those who advise these patients is necessary
  to ensure that patients are fully informed of the alternative operations, to carefully
  build experience, to ensure safety and quality and to monitor outcomes. Herein,
  we present a summary of published methods and outcomes and the arrangements in place
  for fuller evaluation. '
