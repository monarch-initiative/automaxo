input_text: 'The mgDeltalpn mouse model for Marfan syndrome recapitulates the ocular
  phenotypes of the disease.PURPOSE: Fibrillin-1 and -2 are major components of tissue
  microfibrils that compose the ciliary zonule and cornea. While mutations in human
  fibrillin-1 lead to ectopia lentis, a major manifestation of Marfan syndrome (MFS),
  in mice fibrillin-2 can compensate for reduced/lack of fibrillin-1 and maintain
  the integrity of ocular structures. Here we examine the consequences of a heterozygous
  dominant-negative mutation in the Fbn1 gene in the ocular system of the mgDeltalpn
  mouse model for MFS. METHODS: Eyes from mgDeltalpn and wild-type mice at 3 and 6
  months of age were analyzed by histology. The ciliary zonule was analyzed by scanning
  electron microscopy (SEM) and immunofluorescence. RESULTS: Mutant mice presented
  a significantly larger distance of the ciliary body to the lens at 3 and 6 months
  of age when compared to wild-type, and ectopia lentis. Immunofluorescence and SEM
  corroborated those findings in MFS mice, revealing a disorganized mesh of microfibrils
  on the floor of the ciliary body. Moreover, mutant mice also had a larger volume
  of the anterior chamber, possibly due to excess aqueous humor. Finally, losartan
  treatment had limited efficacy in improving ocular phenotypes. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast
  with null or hypomorphic mutations, expression of a dominant-negative form of fibrillin-1
  leads to disruption of microfibrils in the zonule of mice. This in turn causes lens
  dislocation and enlargement of the anterior chamber. Therefore, heterozygous mgDeltalpn
  mice recapitulate the major ocular phenotypes of MFS and can be instrumental in
  understanding the development of the disease.'
