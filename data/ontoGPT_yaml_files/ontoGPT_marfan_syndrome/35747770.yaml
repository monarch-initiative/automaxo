input_text: Personalised external aortic root support (PEARS) to stabilise an aortic
  root aneurysm.Patients with congenitally determined aortic root aneurysms are at
  risk of aortic valve regurgitation, aortic dissection, rupture and death. Personalised
  external aortic root support (PEARS) may provide an alternative to aortic root replacement.
  This was a multi-centre, prospective cohort of all consecutive patients who received
  ExoVasc mesh implants for a dilated aortic root between 2004 and 2017. Baseline
  and peri-operative characteristics, as well as early postoperative outcomes are
  described, and time-related survival and re-operation free survival are estimated
  using the Kaplan-Meier method. From 2004 through 2017, 117 consecutive patients
  have received ExoVasc mesh implants for aortic root aneurysm. The inclusion criteria
  were an aortic root/sinus of Valsalva and ascending aorta with asymptomatic dilatation
  of between 40 and 50 mm in diameter in patients aged 16 years or more. Patients
  with more than mild aortic regurgitation were excluded. There was one early death.
  The length of stay was within seven days in 75% of patients. In conclusion, the
  operation achieves the objectives of valve-sparing root replacement. PEARS may be
  seen as a low-risk conservative operation, which can be applied earlier on in the
  disease process, and which is complementary to more invasive procedures, such as
  valve-sparing root replacement or total root replacement.
