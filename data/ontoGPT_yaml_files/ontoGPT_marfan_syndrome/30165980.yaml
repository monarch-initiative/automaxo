input_text: "External Aortic Root Support to Prevent Aortic Dilatation in Patients
  With Marfan Syndrome.BACKGROUND: Personalized external aortic root support (PEARS)
  was introduced in 2004 for prevention of aortic root dilatation in Marfan patients.
  The individual's aortic root is replicated by 3-dimensional printing. A polymer
  mesh sleeve is manufactured, which is implanted with the aim to support and stabilize
  the aortic wall. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess effectiveness of
  PEARS for prevention of aortic root dilatation in Marfan patients. METHODS: A total
  of 24 consecutive Marfan patients operated 2004 to 2012 were prospectively monitored
  with magnetic resonance imaging. Following a pre-defined protocol, baseline and
  follow-up aorta measurements were made in a blinded random sequence. RESULTS: The
  mean age of the patients was 33 +- 13.3 years (range: 16 to 58 years), and the mean
  aortic root diameter was 45 +- 2.8 mm (range: 41 to 52 mm). Follow-up was 6.3 +-
  2.6 years. There was no increase in the aortic root and ascending aorta diameters,
  but there was a tendency toward reduction: annulus diameter 28.9 +- 2.3 mm to 28.5
  +- 2.4 mm (change -0.39 mm, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -1.05 to 0.27 mm), sinus
  of Valsalva diameter 44.9 +- 2.9 mm to 44.5 +- 3.0 mm (change -0.37 mm, 95% CI:
  -1.23 to 0.51 mm), and ascending aorta diameter 32.4 +- 3.6 mm to 32.3 +- 3.7 mm
  (change -0.10 mm, 95% CI: -0.92 to 0.74 mm). In the same period, the descending
  aorta diameter increased from 22.9 +- 2.4 mm to 24.2 +- 3.0 mm (change 1.32 mm,
  95% CI: 0.70 to 1.94 mm; p < 0.001) with a tendency toward increase in aortic arch
  diameter 24.1 +- 2.0 mm to 24.5 +- 2.8 mm (change 0.41 mm, 95% CI: -0.56 to 1.37
  mm). CONCLUSIONS: PEARS is effective in stabilizing the aortic root and preventing
  its dilatation. It is a viable alternative for prevention of aortic root dissection
  in Marfan patients."
