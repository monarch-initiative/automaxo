input_text: "[Maternal and fetal outcomes with aortic dissection in pregnant patients
  with Marfan syndrome].OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical characteristics of aortic
  dissection in pregnant patients with Marfan syndrome and the maternal and fetal
  outcomes in cardiovascular surgery. METHODS: Seven pregnant women with Marfan syndrome
  with aortic dissection were identified, who were treated in Beijing Anzhen Hospital
  Affiliated to Capital Medical University between January 2012 and September 2014.
  Patient charts were reviewed for cardiovascular surgery, occurrence of complications,
  clinical features and the maternal and fetal outcomes. RESULTS: (1) Among 7 patients,
  4 cases were diagnosed as type A aortic dissection and 3 were cases diagnosed as
  type B aortic dissection. The diagnosis mainly depends on CT angiography. New York
  Heart Association (NYHA) classify into 5 of level II, 1 of level III, 1 of leveI
  IV. Except for 1 patient with cardiac tamponade lead to heart failure, the remaining
  6 cases had no complications. (2) Three patients underwent heart surgery with cardiopulmonary
  bypass in second trimester and two patients underwent heart surgery in third trimester.
  Two patients terminated pregnancy before heart surgery (one of whom underwent artificial
  abortion, one of whom underwent cesarean section in second trimester). (3) The methods
  of cardiovascular surgeries were as follow: 3 of Bentall+Sun', 1 of Bentall+Sun'+
  right coronary artery bypass grafting, 1 of Bentall, 1 of the whole chest aorta
  replacement surgery, and 1 of femoral artery catheter chest aorta with membrane
  mesh stent implantation. The diameter of aortic roots measured during operation
  were 5 cm in 2 cases, 7 cm in 2 cases and 10 cm in 2 cases respectively. Among the
  7 cases, 3 were conducted cesarean sections during cardiovascular surgery, 1 was
  terminated pregnancy due to intrauterine fetal death after cardiovascular surgery,
  and 1 was conducted cesarean section due to severe early-onset preeclampsia at 30
  weeks of pregnancy after cardiovascular surgery. (4) Among the 7 cases, 3 were conducted
  cesarean sections during cardiovascular surgery, the order of which was implemented
  cesarean section under general anesthesia firstly and then operated cardiovascular
  surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass and heparinization. Two were conducted cardiovascular
  surgery after termination of pregnancy by early artificial abortion operation or
  hysterotomy. 1 was conducted Bentall surgery at 18 weeks of pregnancy, after that
  the patient was receiving warfarin until the fetal brain hemorrhage was examined
  by ultrasound at 31 weeks of pregnancy; the patient was conducted cesarean section
  due to intrauterine fetal death. 1 was conducted heart surgery at 24 weeks of pregnancy
  and continue the pregnancy to 30 weeks, was conducted cesarean section due to severe
  early-onset preeclampsia at 30 weeks of pregnancy. (5) Among 7 patients, three patients
  underwent heart surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass combined with cesarean section.
  Two patients terminated pregnancy after heart surgery. Two patients terminated pregnancy
  before heart surgery. Six patients were alive and one patient died of multiple organ
  failure. (6) 3 cases of newborn with birth body mass between 1 080 to 1 490 g.1
  case of birth died after 14 d. 2 cases for newborns were alive without exception.
  CONCLUSION: Aortic dissection poses serious risk for pregnant women with Marfan
  syndrome and the fetus, and the mortality rates for both the mother and the fetus
  are high. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment should be based on maternal
  and fetal conditions (such as aortic dissection, gestational age). When fetus is
  mature, cardiovascular surgery should be carried out with cesarean section. A multi-disciplinary
  team between obstetric and cardiovascular surgery is crucial to the outcome of these
  critical patients."
