input_text: 'A contemporary approach to a young female patient with Loeys-Dietz syndrome
  and an uncomplicated type B aortic dissection: a case report.BACKGROUND: Aortic
  dissection is a relatively uncommon, but often catastrophic disease that requires
  early and accurate diagnosis. It often presents in patients with congenital connective
  tissue disorders. The current aortic surgical techniques are related with serious
  early and late complications. This case report emphasizes the importance of early
  diagnosis of aortic root dilatation and the risk of dissection, especially in patients
  with congenital connective tissue disorders. We present an alternative, contemporary
  and multidisciplinary approach based on the present state of knowledge. CASE PRESENTATION:
  We present a rare case of a young female patient with Loeys-Dietz syndrome who was
  admitted with an uncomplicated aortic dissection (Stanford type B / DeBakey type
  III) and a dilated aortic root. After a period of close surveillance and extensive
  vascular imaging, thoracic endovascular aortic repair was deemed to be technically
  not possible. Medical treatment was optimized and our patient successfully underwent
  a personalised external aortic root support procedure (PEARS) as a contemporary
  alternative to existing aortic root surgical techniques. CONCLUSIONS: This case
  highlights the importance of interdisciplinary approach, close follow-up and multimodality
  imaging. The decision to intervene in a chronic type B aortic dissection is still
  challenging and should be made in experienced centers by an interdisciplinary team.
  However, if an acute complication occurs, thoracic endovascular aortic repair TEVAR
  is the method of choice. In all cases optimal medical treatment is important. There
  is increasing evidence that personalized external aortic root support procedure
  PEARS is effective in stabilizing the aortic root and preventing its dilatation
  and dissection not only in patients with Marfan syndrome, but also in other cases
  of aortic root dilation of other etiologies. Moreover, many publications have reported
  the additional benefit of reduction or even eradication of aortic regurgitation
  by improving coaptation of the aortic valve leaflets in dilated aortas.'
