input_text: 'Republished review: Surgical management of aortic root disease in Marfan
  syndrome and other congenital disorders associated with aortic root aneurysms.Elective
  root replacement in Marfan syndrome has improved life expectancy in affected patients.
  Three forms of surgery are now available: total root replacement (TRR) with a valved
  conduit, valve sparing root replacement (VSRR) and personalised external aortic
  root support (PEARS) with a macroporous mesh sleeve. TRR can be performed irrespective
  of aortic dimensions and a mechanical replacement valve is a secure and near certain
  means of correcting aortic valve regurgitation but has thromboembolic and bleeding
  risks. VSRR offers freedom from anticoagulation and attendant risks of bleeding
  but reoperation for aortic regurgitation runs at 1.3% per annum. A prospective multi-institutional
  study has found this to be an underestimate of the true rate of valve-related adverse
  events. PEARS conserves the aortic root anatomy and optimises the chance of maintaining
  valve function but average follow-up is under 5 years and so the long-term results
  are yet to be determined. Patients are on average in their 30s and so the cumulative
  lifetime need for reoperation, and of any valve-related complications, are consequently
  substantial. With lowering surgical risk of prophylactic root replacement, the threshold
  for intervention has reduced progressively over 30 years to 4.5 cm and so an increasing
  number of patients who are not destined to have a dissection are now having root
  replacement. In evaluation of these three forms of surgery, the number needed to
  treat to prevent dissection and the balance of net benefit and harm in future patients
  must be considered. '
