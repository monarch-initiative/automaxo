input_text: 'Obstetric and cardiac outcomes in women with Marfan syndrome and an aortic
  root diameter <= 45mm.OBJECTIVE: To assess obstetric and aortic outcomes in women
  with Marfan Syndrome according to aortic root diameter, in view of recommendations
  for caesarean delivery when the aortic root diameter is >=40 mm in the 2010 American
  guidelines versus >45 mm in the 2011 European guidelines. STUDY DESIGN: In this
  retrospective cohort study conducted at Sainte-Justine Mother and Child Tertiary
  Hospital, 27 pregnancies in 20 women with Marfan Syndrome as defined by the international
  criteria, were followed prospectively between 1994 and 2017, after excluding women
  with prior aortic surgery. Obstetric and aortic outcomes were compared in 2 groups
  according to aortic root diameter: < 40 mm (21 pregnancies) and 40-45 mm (6 pregnancies).
  RESULTS: 21/27 women had a vaginal delivery. The caesarean section rate was 23.8%
  and 16.7% in women with diameter <40 mm and 40-45 mm respectively (p-value = 1),
  and perinatal outcome was similar across groups. Two women with a prepregnancy aortic
  root diameter <40 mm developed an acute type B dissection during the third trimester.
  Both had a family history of aortic dissection. CONCLUSIONS: Vaginal delivery with
  rigorous pain control and avoidance of Valsalva maneuver may be safely considered
  in women with Marfan Syndrome and an aortic root diameter <=45 mm. The risk of type
  B aortic dissection during pregnancy is hard to predict. Other factors such as family
  history of dissection and descending aorta size may play an important role, and
  this may modify our counselling.'
