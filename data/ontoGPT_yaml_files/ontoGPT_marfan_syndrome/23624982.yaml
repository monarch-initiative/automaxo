input_text: 'External aortic root support: a histological and mechanical study in
  sheep.OBJECTIVES: Personalized external aortic root support has completed initial
  evaluation and has technology appraisal in the UK for patients with Marfan syndrome
  for use as an alternative to root replacement. Its long-term success in preventing
  aortic dissection remains uncertain. Here, we report a study in sheep to establish
  whether the externally supporting mesh, as used clinically, is biologically incorporated.
  The strength of the resulting mesh/artery composite has been tested. METHODS: The
  carotid artery of growing sheep (n=6) was enclosed in a mesh sleeve made of a polymer,
  polyethylene terephthalate. After a predefined interval of 4-6 months, a length
  of the artery was excised, including the sleeved and unsleeved portions, and was
  stress tested and examined histologically. RESULTS: One animal died of pneumonia
  7 days after implantation. Comparing sleeved with normal segments, the overall thickness
  was increased and there was a fibrotic sheet in the periarterial space. The overall
  vessel wall architecture was preserved in all specimens. Although media thickness
  of ensleeved arteries was smaller and in one animal mild oedema was found in one
  quadrant of the outer part of the media. There was a significant increase in stiffness
  and maximum tensile strength of the supported segments compared with normal arterial
  tissue. CONCLUSIONS: Polyethylene terephthalate mesh, as used for the external support
  of the dilated aortic root in Marfan syndrome, becomes incorporated in the periadventitial
  tissue of the carotid artery of sheep. Limited thinning of the media, without any
  signs of inflammation or medial necrosis, was visible. There was a significantly
  greater tensile strength in the carotid artery/mesh composite compared with the
  unsleeved carotid artery.'
