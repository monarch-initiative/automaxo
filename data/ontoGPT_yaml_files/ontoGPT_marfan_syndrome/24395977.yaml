input_text: "Personalised external aortic root support (PEARS) in Marfan syndrome:
  analysis of 1-9 year outcomes by intention-to-treat in a cohort of the first 30
  consecutive patients to receive a novel tissue and valve-conserving procedure, compared
  with the published results of aortic root replacement.OBJECTIVE: Among people with
  Marfan syndrome who have a typical aortic root aneurysm, dissection is a characteristic
  cause of premature death. To pre-empt Type A dissection, composite root replacement
  with a mechanical valve became the standard of care in the 1980s and 1990s. This
  is being superseded by valve-sparing aortic root replacement to avoid lifelong anticoagulation.
  In 2004, a total root and valve-sparing procedure, personalised external aortic
  support, was introduced. We report here results among the first 30 recipients. METHODS:
  From cross-sectional digital images, the patient's own aorta is modelled by computer
  aided design and a replica is made in thermoplastic by rapid prototyping. On this,
  a personalised support of a macroporous polymer mesh is manufactured. The mesh is
  positioned around the aorta, closely applied from the aortoventricular junction
  to beyond the brachiocephalic artery. The operation is performed with a beating
  heart and usually without cardiopulmonary bypass. RESULTS: Between 2004 and 2011,
  30 patients, median age 28 years (IQR 20-44) had this operation and have been prospectively
  followed for 1.4-8.8 years by February 2013. During a total of 133 patient-years
  there were no deaths or cerebrovascular, aortic or valve-related events. These early
  outcomes are better than published results for the more radical extirpative root
  replacement operations. CONCLUSIONS: The aortic valve, the root architecture, and
  the blood/endothelia interface are conserved. The perioperative burden is less and
  there has been freedom from aortic and valvular events. A prospective comparative
  study is planned."
