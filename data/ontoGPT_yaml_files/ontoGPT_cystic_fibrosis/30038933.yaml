input_text: An Adeno-Associated Viral Vector Capable of Penetrating the Mucus Barrier
  to Inhaled Gene Therapy.Diffusion of the viral vectors evaluated in inhaled gene
  therapy clinical trials to date are largely hindered within airway mucus, which
  limits their access to, and transduction of, the underlying airway epithelium prior
  to clearance from the lung. Here, we discovered that adeno-associated virus (AAV)
  serotype 6 was able to rapidly diffuse through mucus collected from cystic fibrosis
  (CF) patients, unlike previously tested AAV serotypes. A point mutation of the AAV6
  capsid suggests a potential mechanism by which AAV6 avoids adhesion to the mucus
  mesh. Significantly greater transgene expression was achieved with AAV6 compared
  to a mucoadhesive serotype, AAV1, in air-liquid interface cultures of human CF bronchial
  epithelium with naturally secreted mucus or induced mucus hypersecretion. In addition,
  AAV6 achieved superior distribution and overall level of transgene expression compared
  to AAV1 in the airways and whole lungs, respectively, of transgenic mice with airway
  mucus obstruction. Our findings motivate further evaluation and clinical development
  of AAV6 for inhaled gene therapy.
