input_text: "Nebuliser systems for drug delivery in cystic fibrosis.BACKGROUND: Nebuliser
  systems are used to deliver medications to the lungs, to control the symptoms and
  the progression of lung disease in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). There are many
  different nebulised-medications prescribed for people with CF and there are many
  different types of nebuliser systems. Some of these nebulised medications are licenced
  for, and can be taken via only one type of nebuliser system; some are licensed for,
  and can be taken via more than one type of nebuliser system. This is an update to
  a previous systematic review. OBJECTIVES: To assess the time efficiency, effectiveness,
  safety, cost and impact of use (e.g. burden of care, adherence, quality of life
  (QoL)) of different nebuliser systems, when used with different inhaled medications
  for people with CF. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and
  Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive
  electronic database searches, handsearching of relevant journals and abstract books
  containing conference proceedings. We searched the reference lists of each study
  for additional publications and approached the manufacturers of both nebuliser systems
  and nebulised medications for published and unpublished data. We also searched online
  trial registries. Date of the most recent search: 9 August 2023. SELECTION CRITERIA:
  Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs comparing nebuliser systems, including
  conventional nebulisers, vibrating mesh technology (VMT) systems, adaptive aerosol
  delivery (AAD) systems and ultrasonic nebuliser systems. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS:
  Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion. They also independently
  extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. A third review author assessed studies
  where agreement could not be reached. They assessed the certainty of the evidence
  using GRADE. MAIN RESULTS: The search identified 216 studies with 33 of these (2270
  participants) included in the review. These studies compared the delivery of tobramycin,
  colistin, dornase alfa, hypertonic saline and other solutions through the different
  nebuliser systems in children and adults with CF. This review demonstrates variability
  in the delivery of medication depending on the nebuliser system used. The certainty
  of the evidence ranged from low to very low. Some conventional nebuliser systems
  providing higher flows, higher respirable fractions, and smaller particles decrease
  treatment time, increase deposition (the amount of drug reaching the lung), and
  may be preferred by people with CF, as compared to other conventional nebuliser
  systems providing lower flows, lower respirable fractions and larger particles.
  Newer nebuliser systems using AAD, or VMT (or both) reduce treatment time compared
  to conventional systems. Deposition (as a percentage of priming dose) with AAD is
  greater than with conventional systems. VMT systems may give greater deposition
  than conventional systems when measuring sputum levels. The available data indicate
  that these newer systems are safe when used with an appropriate priming dose, which
  may be different to the priming dose used for conventional systems. There is an
  indication that adherence is maintained or improved and that individuals prefer
  AAD or VMT systems, but also that some nebuliser systems using VMT may be subject
  to increased system failures. There is limited, unclear evidence on the impact of
  different nebuliser systems on lung function and a lack of data on the impact of
  different nebuliser systems on our outcomes of quality of life (QoL), adverse effects,
  respiratory exacerbations and related implications, adherence, satisfaction, cost
  and device reliability. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Newer technologies e.g. AAD and VMT
  have advantages over conventional systems in terms of treatment time, deposition
  as a percentage of priming dose, preference and adherence. Data are lacking for
  all varieties of medications which are used in CF care, including different inhaled
  antibiotics or hypertonic saline, with all delivery (nebuliser system) possibilities.
  Long-term RCTs are needed to evaluate different nebuliser systems to determine patient-focused
  outcomes (such as QoL and burden of care), safe and effective dosing levels of a
  wide variety of medications, clinical outcomes (such as hospitalisations and need
  for antibiotics), and an economic evaluation of their use. There are insufficient
  data to establish whether one nebuliser system is better than another overall. Clinicians
  should be aware of the variability in the performance of different nebuliser systems,
  compatibility with specific nebulised medication, and they must work with their
  patients to choose the best nebuliser system for each individual. This is likely
  to be an ongoing process as the needs and circumstances of each individual change
  over time."
