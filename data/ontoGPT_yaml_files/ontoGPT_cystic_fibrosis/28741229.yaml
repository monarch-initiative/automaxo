input_text: 'Inhaled Antimicrobials for Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia: Practical
  Aspects.Positive experience with inhaled antibiotics in pulmonary infections of
  patients with cystic fibrosis has paved the way for their utilization in mechanically
  ventilated, critically ill patients with lower respiratory tract infections. A successful
  antibiotic delivery depends upon the size of the generated particle and the elimination
  of drug impaction in the large airways and the ventilator circuit. Generated droplet
  size is mainly affected by the type of the nebulizer employed. Currently, jet, ultrasonic,
  and vibrating mesh nebulizers are marketed; the latter can deliver optimal antibiotic
  particle size. Promising novel drug-device combinations are able to release drug
  concentrations of 25- to 300-fold the minimum inhibitory concentration of the targeted
  pathogens into the pulmonary alveoli. The most important practical steps of nebulization
  include pre-assessment and preparation of the patient (suctioning, sedation, possible
  bronchodilation, adjustment of necessary ventilator settings); adherence to the
  procedure (drug preparation, avoidance of unnecessary tubing connections, interruption
  of heated humidification, removal of heat-moisture exchanger); inspection of the
  procedure (check for residual in drug chamber, change of expiratory filter, return
  sedation, and ventilator settings to previous status); and surveillance of the patient
  for adverse events (close monitoring of the patient and particularly of peak airway
  pressure and bronchoconstriction). Practical aspects of nebulization are very important
  to ensure optimal drug delivery and safe procedure for the patient. Therefore, the
  development of an operational checklist is a priority for every department adopting
  this modality.'
