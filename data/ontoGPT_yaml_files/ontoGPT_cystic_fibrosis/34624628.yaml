input_text: "Combined use of rheology and portable low-field NMR in cystic fibrosis
  patients.BACKGROUND: As most cystic fibrosis (CF) patients progress to respiratory
  failure, lung functionality assessment is pivotal. We previously developed a test
  that indirectly monitors airways (inflammation/functional test) by measuring the
  spin-spin relaxation time (T2m) of the water hydrogens present in CF sputum. Here
  the T2m significance in the monitoring of CF lung disease was further investigated
  by studying the correlation of T2m with: 1) sputum viscoelasticity, 2) mucociliary
  clearability index (MCI)/cough clearability index (CCI) and 3) sputum average mesh-size.
  METHODS: Sputum samples from 25 consenting CF subjects were analyzed by rheology
  tests (elastic modulus G and zero shear viscosity eta0) and Low Field Nuclear Magnetic
  (LF-NMR) resonance (T2m). MCI/CCI were calculated from the rheological parameters.
  The average mesh-size (xi) of the sputum structure was then evaluated by rheology/LF-NMR,
  together with FEV1 for each patient. RESULTS: There was an inverse correlation between
  G and eta0 versus T2m, indicating that a worsening of the lung condition (T2m-FEV1
  drop) is paralleled by an increase in sputum viscoelasticity (G and eta0) favoring
  mucus stasis/inflammation. A direct correlation was also observed between T2m and
  MCI/CCI, showing that T2m provides information as to airway mucus clearing. Moreover,
  there was a direct correlation between T2m and the average sputum mesh size (xi).
  CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated a correlation between T2m (measured in CF patient's
  sputum) and the sputum viscoelasticity/average mesh-size and with MCI/CCI, parameters
  related to airway mucus clearing. Thus, the present data strengthen the potential
  of our test to provide indirect monitoring of airway disease course in CF patients
  as T2m depends on mucus solid concentration and nanostructure."
