input_text: New nebulizer technology to monitor adherence and nebulizer performance
  in cystic fibrosis.Topical delivery of aerosolized therapies is an established treatment
  for chronic airway infection and inflammation in cystic fibrosis (CF). Recent developments
  in nebuliser technology have enabled Adaptive Aerosol Delivery (AAD) of mesh generated
  aerosol particles resulting in more efficient airway deposition than existing jet
  nebulizers. An additional feature of these new devices is the ability to record
  and examine the performance of the device by downloading stored data (electronic
  data capture). In a series of studies we have used this downloading facility to
  monitor treatment times and examine adherence to nebulizer therapy in our pediatric
  patients. We found routine adherence monitoring is possible in busy CF clinic. We
  have shown that good adherence to treatment can be maintained in both patients chronically
  infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa on long-term therapy, and in patients with
  first/new growths of Pseudomonas on short-term eradication therapy. When adherence
  was examined from an individual perspective, we demonstrated a wide variation both
  between and within individual patients. A further modification of AAD technology,
  Target Inhalation Mode (TIM) optimises patient inhalations through a direct feedback
  mechanism. This new breathing mode has also been evaluated in our pediatric CF clinic
  in a recent randomized controlled trial (RCT) and we have shown that children maintain
  adherence to treatment through the TIM mouthpiece and average treatment times reduced
  from 6.9 to 3.7 min when using TIM. This is a new era of aerosol delivery and novel
  advances in medical devices need to be monitored and assessed rigorously, particularly
  as new and potentially expensive therapies emerge from translational studies. Electronic
  data capture enables CF teams to work in an open partnership with patients to achieve
  the common goals of improving drug delivery and reducing patient burden.
