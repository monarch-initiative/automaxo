input_text: Ex vivo characterization of particle transport in mucus secretions coating
  freshly excised mucosal tissues.Sustained drug delivery to mucosal surfaces has
  the potential to improve the effectiveness of prophylactic and therapeutic treatments
  for numerous diseases and conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease, sexually
  transmitted diseases, cystic fibrosis, glaucoma, dry eye, and various cancers. Sustained
  delivery systems such as nanoparticles can be useful for mucosal delivery, but recent
  work suggests they must penetrate the rapidly cleared mucus barrier that overlies
  all mucosal epithelia to achieve uniform distribution on epithelial surfaces and
  enhanced residence time. Thus, it is important to evaluate the mucus-penetrating
  ability of nanosized delivery systems in preclinical animal studies, and for administration
  to humans. We describe a simple ex vivo method to visualize and quantify nanoparticle
  transport in mucus on fresh mucosal tissues. Using this method in murine models,
  we observed variations in the mucus mesh at different anatomical locations, as well
  as cyclical variations that may have implications for mucosal delivery.
