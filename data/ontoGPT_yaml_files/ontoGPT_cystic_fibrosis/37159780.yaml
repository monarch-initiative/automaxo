input_text: "A Systematic Review of Cystic Fibrosis in Children: Can Non-Medical Therapy
  Options Lead to a Better Mental Health Outcome?Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a chronic
  disorder that begins at an early age, so it is crucial to be aware of the physical
  and emotional burden placed on individuals suffering from it and their families.
  It significantly impacts an individual's life; therefore, it is essential to acknowledge
  the effects of the disease on physical and mental health. Our systematic review
  aims to highlight the areas of life affected by cystic fibrosis and evaluate various
  non-medical treatment options that may support the mental health of CF patients.
  We selected PubMed, Google Scholar, and MEDLINE (Medical Literature Analysis and
  Retrieval System Online) as our databases. We initially found 146,095 articles and
  narrowed the number of articles down using filters, exclusion and inclusion criteria,
  and various combinations of Medical Subheadings (MeSH) and key terms. We decided
  to use a final count of nine articles for our systematic review. The studies we
  included highlighted the negative impact of cystic fibrosis on mental health, like
  depression and anxiety, as well as on sleep, physical health, and overall quality
  of life. Several non-medical interventions, such as logotherapy, psychological interventions,
  complementary and alternative medicine, and many more, have been shown to enhance
  the mental health of many participants. Studies suggested that such therapy options
  may greatly benefit individuals with cystic fibrosis and their current treatment
  plan. This review indicates that non-medical therapy options can enhance the mental
  health of individuals suffering from cystic fibrosis and that it is crucial to bring
  more attention to preventing and treating mental health issues in cystic fibrosis
  patients. However, as current data is limited, more research with a larger number
  of participants over an extended period of time is necessary to better evaluate
  the efficacy of non-medical interventions on mental health."
