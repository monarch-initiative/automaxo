input_text: '[Inhaled therapies for cystic fibrosis].Inhaled therapies play a significant
  role in the management of cystic fibrosis patients. Mucolytic and airway-rehydrating
  agents improve mucociliary clearance and respiratory functional status. Nebulized
  antibiotherapy achieve high local concentration, while reducing systemic toxicity.
  Tolerance to inhaled treatments is good excepting frequent bronchoconstriction which
  can usually be prevented by prior administration of beta2-mimetics. The majority
  of treatments are only available in liquid formulations. Thus, nebulization is the
  most frequently used inhalation mode. Vibrating-mesh nebulizers have significantly
  reduced inhalation time.'
