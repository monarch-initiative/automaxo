  systems are used to deliver medications to control the symptoms and the progression
  of lung disease in people with cystic fibrosis. Many types of nebuliser systems
  are available for use with various medications; however, there has been no previous
  systematic review which has evaluated these systems. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate effectiveness,
  safety, burden of treatment and adherence to nebulised therapy using different nebuliser
  systems for people with cystic fibrosis. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane
  Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references
  identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearching of relevant
  journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We searched the reference
  lists of each study for additional publications and approached the manufacturers
  of both nebuliser systems and nebulised medications for published and unpublished
  data. Date of the most recent search: 15 Oct 2012. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised
  controlled trials or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing nebuliser systems
  including conventional nebulisers, vibrating mesh technology systems, adaptive aerosol
  delivery systems and ultrasonic nebuliser systems. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS:
  Two authors independently assessed studies for inclusion. They also independently
  extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. A third author assessed studies where
  agreement could not be reached. MAIN RESULTS: The search identified 40 studies with
  20 of these (1936 participants) included in the review. These studies compared the
  delivery of tobramycin, colistin, dornase alfa, hypertonic sodium chloride and other
  solutions through the different nebuliser systems. This review demonstrates variability
  in the delivery of medication depending on the nebuliser system used. Conventional
  nebuliser systems providing higher flows, higher respirable fractions and smaller
  particles decrease treatment time, increase deposition and may be preferred by people
  with CF, as compared to conventional nebuliser systems providing lower flows, lower
  respirable fractions and larger particles. Nebulisers using adaptive aerosol delivery
  or vibrating mesh technology reduce treatment time to a far greater extent. Deposition
  (as a percentage of priming dose) is greater than conventional with adaptive aerosol
  delivery. Vibrating mesh technology systems may give greater deposition than conventional
  when measuring sputum levels, but lower deposition when measuring serum levels or
  using gamma scintigraphy. The available data indicate that these newer systems are
  safe when used with an appropriate priming dose, which may be different to the priming
  dose used for conventional systems. There is an indication that adherence is maintained
  or improved with systems which use these newer technologies, but also that some
  nebuliser systems using vibrating mesh technology may be subject to increased failures.
  AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should be aware of the variability in the performance
  of different nebuliser systems. Technologies such as adaptive aerosol delivery and
  vibrating mesh technology have advantages over conventional systems in terms of
  treatment time, deposition as a percentage of priming dose, patient preference and
  adherence. There is a need for long-term randomised controlled trials of these technologies
  to determine patient-focused outcomes (such as quality of life and burden of care),
  safe and effective dosing levels of medications and clinical outcomes (such as hospitalisations
  and need for antibiotics) and an economic evaluation of their use."
