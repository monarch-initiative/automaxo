input_text: 'Vibrating Mesh Nebulisation of Pro-Antimicrobial Peptides for Use in
  Cystic Fibrosis.BACKGROUND: There has been considerable interest in the use of antimicrobial
  peptides (AMPs) as antimicrobial therapeutics in many conditions including cystic
  fibrosis (CF). The aim of this study is to determine if the prodrugs of AMPs (pro-AMPs)
  can be delivered to the lung by a vibrating mesh nebuliser (VMN) and whether the
  pro-AMP modification has any effect on delivery. METHODS: Physical characteristics
  of the peptides (AMP and pro-AMP) and antimicrobial activity were compared before
  and after nebulisation. Droplet size distribution was determined by laser diffraction
  and cascade impaction. Delivery to a model lung was determined in models of spontaneously-breathing
  and mechanically-ventilated patients. RESULTS: The physical characteristics and
  antimicrobial activities were unchanged after nebulisation. Mean droplet size diameters
  were below 5 mum in both determinations, with the fine particle fraction approximately
  67% for both peptides. Approximately 25% of the nominal dose was delivered in the
  spontaneously-breathing model for both peptides, with higher deliveries observed
  in the mechanically-ventilated model. Delivery times were approximately 170 s per
  mL for both peptides and the residual volume in the nebuliser was below 10% in nearly
  all cases. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that the delivery of (pro-)AMPs
  to the lung using a VMN is feasible and that the prodrug modification is not detrimental.
  They support the further development of pro-AMPs as therapeutics in CF.'
