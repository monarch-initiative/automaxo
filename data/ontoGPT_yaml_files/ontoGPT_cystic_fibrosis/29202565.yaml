input_text: 'The efficacy of topical hyaluronan in rhinosinusitis: a systematic review.Rhinosinusitis
  is one of the most common inflammatory conditions of the nasal cavity and paranasal
  sinuses and is one of the most common causes of absence from work and for visits
  to the family doctor. The treatment strategy in both acute rhinosinusitis (ARS)
  and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is to reduce the severity of the symptoms, minimize
  the duration of the disease and prevent complications. Topical therapy has become
  an important tool in otolaryngologists armamentarium for rhinosinusitis treatment.
  Recently, topical hyaluronic acid (HA), the major component of many extracellular
  matrices that promotes tissue healing, including activation and moderation of the
  inflammatory responses, cell proliferation, migration and angiogenesis, has been
  proposed for ARS and CRS adjuvant tool. The aim of the study is to systematically
  review the published literature regarding all the therapeutic effects of HA on the
  ARS and CRS. Relevant published studies were found in PubMed, Google Scholar and
  Ovid, using a combined keyword search or medical subject headings. At the end of
  our study selection process, 5 relevant publications were included: 2 of them investigated
  the potential role of HA in reducing symptoms and preventing exacerbations of CRS
  in adult population, two of them in paediatric patients affected by upper respiratory
  tract infections and one of them in cystic fibrosis patients with bacterial rhinopharyngitis.
  Data deriving from the present review of 5 clinical studies showed that the use
  of topical HA represents a relevant therapeutic advance in rhinosinusitis to minimize
  symptoms and prevent reacutization with a significant improvement of their quality
  of life, as it avoids systemic side effects and increases local drug activity. Further
  studies on larger populations and with new specific nebulization devices for upper
  airway are needed to confirm these encouraging results.'
