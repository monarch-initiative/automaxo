input_text: 'The penetration of fresh undiluted sputum expectorated by cystic fibrosis
  patients by non-adhesive polymer nanoparticles.Highly viscoelastic and adhesive
  sputum has precluded efficient nanoparticle-based drug and gene delivery to the
  lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). We sought to determine whether nanoparticles
  coated with non-mucoadhesive polymers could penetrate CF sputum, and to use these
  "muco-inert particles" (MIPs) as non-destructive nanoprobes to characterize the
  sputum microstructure. Particles as large as 200 nm in diameter that were densely
  coated with low MW polyethylene glycol (PEG) moved through undiluted CF sputum with
  average speeds up to 90-fold faster than similarly-sized uncoated particles. On
  the other hand, the transport of both coated and uncoated 500 nm particles was strongly
  hindered. The local viscosity of sputum, encountered by the fastest 10% of 200 nm
  MIPs, was only 5-fold higher than that of water, whereas the bulk viscosity was
  10,000-fold higher at low shear rates. Using measured transport rates of various
  sized MIPs combined with an obstruction-scaling model, we determined that the average
  3D mesh spacing of CF sputum is approximately 140+/-50 nm (range: 60-300 nm). Taken
  together, these results demonstrate that nanoparticles up to 200 nm in diameter
  that do not adhere to CF sputum can move rapidly through this critical barrier by
  accessing pores that are filled with a low viscosity fluid. The results also offer
  hope that desperately needed sputum-penetrating drug- and gene-carrier nanoparticles
  can be developed for CF.'
