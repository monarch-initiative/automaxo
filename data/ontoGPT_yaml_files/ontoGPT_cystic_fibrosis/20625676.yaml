input_text: 'Cell profile of BAL fluid in children and adolescents with and without
  lung disease.The objective of this study was to review the literature on bronchoalveolar
  lavage fluid cell profiles in healthy children and adolescents, as well as on the
  use of BAL as a diagnostic and follow-up tool for lung disease patients in this
  age bracket. To that end, we used the Medline database, compiling studies published
  between 1989 and 2009 employing the following MeSH descriptors (with Boolean operators)
  as search terms: bronchoalveolar lavage AND cytology OR cell AND child. In healthy
  children, the cell profile includes alveolar macrophages (> 80%), lymphocytes (approximately
  10%), neutrophils (approximately 2%) and eosinophils (< 1%). The profile varies
  depending on the disease under study. The number of neutrophils is greater in wheezing
  children, especially in non-atopic children, as well as in those with pulmonary
  infectious and inflammatory profiles, including cystic fibrosis and interstitial
  lung disease. Eosinophil counts are elevated in children/adolescents with asthma
  and can reach high levels in those with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis
  or eosinophilic syndromes. In a heterogeneous group of diseases, the number of lymphocytes
  can increase. Evaluation of the BAL fluid cell profile, when used in conjunction
  with clinical and imaging findings, has proven to be an essential tool in the investigation
  of various lung diseases. Less invasive than transbronchial and open lung biopsies,
  BAL has great clinical value. Further studies adopting standard international protocols
  should be carried out. Such studies should involve various age groups and settings
  in order to obtain reference values for BAL fluid cell profiles, which are necessary
  for a more accurate interpretation of findings in children and adolescents with
  lung diseases.'
