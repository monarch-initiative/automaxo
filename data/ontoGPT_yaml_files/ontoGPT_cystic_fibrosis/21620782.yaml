input_text: 'A randomised controlled trial of breathing modes for adaptive aerosol
  delivery in children with cystic fibrosis.BACKGROUND: Aerosol delivery is a cornerstone
  of CF airways disease management. New nebulisers have reduced treatment times by
  utilising mesh technology for aerosol production. We have evaluated a further modification
  (target inhalation mode (TIM)) that may reduce treatment delivery times further.
  METHODS: Following a baseline period on tidal breathing mode (TBM), children with
  CF on long-term aerosol therapy were randomly allocated to either TIM, which optimises
  patient inhalations through a direct feedback mechanism, or to continue TBM. The
  primary outcome was nebuliser treatment times with secondary outcomes being adherence
  and patient preference. RESULTS: The ten children allocated TIM reduced their mean
  (SD) treatment times from 6.9(2.9) to 3.7(2.3) minutes (p<0.001). In contrast, treatment
  times were unchanged in the ten children allocated TBM. Mean adherence was maintained
  in the TIM group but declined in patients allocated TBM by >5%. All children preferred
  TIM to TBM. CONCLUSION: TIM reduces nebuliser treatment times and may positively
  impact on adherence, although longer duration studies are required to examine this.
