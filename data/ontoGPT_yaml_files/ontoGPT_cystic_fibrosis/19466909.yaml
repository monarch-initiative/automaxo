input_text: 'Inhalation equipment hygiene: a belgian national survey.BACKGROUND: Nebulizers
  are a potential source of contamination of the respiratory tract. Nevertheless,
  only a few clear guidelines regarding cleaning and disinfection of nebulizers are
  available. This survey aims to analyze the common household methods used by cystic
  fibrosis (CF) patients in Belgium. METHODS: A questionnaire about type of nebulizer,
  methods, and frequency of cleaning, disinfection, and drying was established by
  physiotherapists at the Belgian CF centers. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The Belgian
  CF Association sent this questionnaire to all Belgian CF patients. Of the 903 questionnaires
  distributed, 379 (42%) were returned. Fifty-two, 40 and 8% of patients used a vibrating-mesh
  nebulizer, jet nebulizer, or ultrasonic device, respectively. Ninety-eight percent
  of patients cleaned their material and soap was used by 35% of patients. Disinfection
  was performed by 91% of the patients and was daily performed by 57% of patients.
  Thermal disinfection (boiling water or sterilizer), a hypochlorite-based solution,
  or acetic acid solution was used by 44, 29, and 25% of patients, respectively, to
  disinfect their nebulizers. Thermal disinfection was used by 37 and 53% of patients
  using a classical or vibrating-mesh nebulizer, respectively. After cleaning or disinfection,
  91% of the material was dried. The high percentage of Belgian CF patients disinfecting
  their nebulizer proves that they seem aware of the hygiene problem. The lack of
  unanimous guidelines in Belgium at the time of the study perhaps explains the variety
  of methods used. The arrival of vibrating-mesh nebulizers has led to a change in
  disinfection methods.'
