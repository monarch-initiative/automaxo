input_text: 'Does probiotic supplementation affect pulmonary exacerbation and intestinal
  inflammation in cystic fibrosis: a systematic review of randomized clinical trials.BACKGROUND:
  Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) usually have abnormal intestinal microbiota due
  to massive exposure to antibiotics. Probiotics could modify the gut microbiota and
  hence may affect CF management. So the aim of present systematic review was evaluation
  of the efficacy and safety of probiotic supplementation for the management of cystic
  fibrosis. DATA SOURCES: We searched PubMed, Science Direct, Google Scholar, Springer
  Cochrane Library Databases until January 2016 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
  performed in pediatric or adult populations related to the study aim. Key words
  were selected based on Mesh terms. Based on the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme
  checklist, eligibility of included articles was evaluated. RESULTS: Five studies
  included in this review represent 188 participants with a follow up period ranging
  from 1 month to 6 months. The results of the included studies supporting the use
  of probiotics in management of pulmonary exacerbation and intestinal calprotectin
  in patients with cystic fibrosis. However the level of evidence was limited. CONCLUSIONS:
  The lack of high quality RCTs makes it impossible to support a general recommendation
  about the use of probiotics in the treatment of CF pulmonary exacerbation and intestinal
  inflammation.'
