input_text: Probing the size limit for nanomedicine penetration into Burkholderia
  multivorans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms.Encapsulation of antibiotics into
  nanoparticles is a potential strategy to eradicate biofilms. To allow further optimization
  of nanomedicines for biofilm eradication, the influence of the nanoparticle size
  on the penetration into dense biofilm clusters needs to be investigated. In the
  present study, the penetration of nanoparticles with diameters ranging from 40 to
  550 nm into two biofilms, Burkholderia multivorans LMG 18825 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa
  LMG 27622, was evaluated using confocal microscopy. Through image analysis, the
  percentage of particles able to penetrate into dense biofilm clusters was calculated.
  The size cut off for optimal penetration into biofilm clusters was located around
  100-130 nm for both biofilms. The mesh size of the biofilm matrix and the size of
  the channels in between the bacteria of the clusters are two factors which likely
  play a role in the exclusion of the larger particles. For B. multivorans, a sharp
  drop in the penetration into the clusters is seen for particles larger than 130
  nm while for P. aeruginosa, a more gradual decrease in penetration could be observed.
  The overall penetration of the nanoparticles was slightly lower for P. aeruginosa
  than for B. multivorans. Based on these results, it could be concluded that nanocarriers
  of about 100 nm and smaller are good candidates to improve the treatment of chronic
  pulmonary biofilms in CF patients. Furthermore, the confocal microscopy method demonstrated
  here is a useful tool to assess the penetration of nanomedicines in biofilm clusters.
  Such information is important to optimize nanomedicine formulations for the treatment
  of biofilm infections.
