input_text: 'Neutrophil bactericidal activity and host defenses in cystic fibrosis:
  a narrative review.Background and Objective: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a disorder
  that affects the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Without
  properly functioning CFTR channels, chloride does not exit respiratory epithelial
  cells, and consequently the mucus lining the surface of the cells becomes thick.
  This viscous mucus accumulates and causes abnormal function of the mucociliary apparatus,
  which can lead to bacterial colonization, infections with Staphylococcus aureus
  (S. aureus) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), and eventually lung damage.
  Recent studies have shown that the increased susceptibility to respiratory infections
  in CF patients may also be due to defects in neutrophil function, but the exact
  mechanism is uncertain. Methods: The PubMed database was searched on February 10,
  2023 and again on July 23, 2023 to compile a comprehensive list of clinical and
  experimental studies to evaluate neutrophil function in CF. The first search included
  a combination of MeSH terms: "cystic fibrosis" and "neutrophils/physiology". A separate
  second search included a combination of the MeSH terms: "neutrophils" and "cystic
  fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator". Key Content and Findings: Neutrophils
  from patients with CF have decreased transfer of chloride into phagolysosomes after
  bacterial ingestion and have dysregulated degranulation. This reduces the production
  of toxic oxidative radicals, especially hypochlorous acid (HOCl), and reduces bactericidal
  activity. CFTR potentiators correct the dysregulated degranulation in patients with
  CF and increased neutrophil killing activity. A reduced concentration of chloride
  in in vitro assays also reduces neutrophil killing activity; these observations
  are relevant to the reduced chloride concentrations in respiratory secretions in
  patients with CF. Conclusions: This literature review summarizes studies that demonstrate
  that an important defect in CF neutrophils lies in the oxygen-dependent pathway
  in phagolysosomes and studies with ivacaftor demonstrate that this drug corrects
  CF neutrophil function. These studies demonstrate the potential utility of using
  easily available neutrophils to study drug effects in CF patients.'
