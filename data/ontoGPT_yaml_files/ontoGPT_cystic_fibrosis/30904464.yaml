input_text: 'Cystic fibrosis in the modern therapeutic era: Give the shower a thought!Fifty-two
  meshes of e-flow rapid  were characterized for tobramycin delivery with a laser
  diffractometer after 6 months of home use by cystic fibrosis patients treated with
  various nebulized drugs. Three meshes were out of order and 30 considered to be
  defective for tobramycin delivery. The use of the specific mesh cleaning shower
  system permitted 14 defective meshes to be in the expected range of nebulized volume.'
