input_text: 'Aerosol delivery of recombinant human DNase I: in vitro comparison of
  a vibrating-mesh nebulizer with a jet nebulizer.BACKGROUND: Inhaled recombinant
  human DNase I (rhDNase) improves clearance of visco-elastic secretions in patients
  with cystic fibrosis. Because of their portability, newer-generation vibrating-mesh
  nebulizers offer greater convenience for the patient, but their efficiency in delivering
  rhDNase has not been determined. METHODS: We compared a newer-generation vibrating-mesh
  nebulizer (Omron MicroAir) to a Pari LC+ with the Pari ProNeb Ultra compressor (a
  commonly employed rhDNase administration system). With the Next Generation Pharmaceutical
  Impactor, we determined aerosol particle distribution. We also measured mass output
  efficiency, nebulization time, and mass of rhDNase that deposited on a filter during
  simulated breathing. RESULTS: The mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) and geometric
  standard deviation (GSD) of aerosol from the MicroAir (MMAD 4.3 microm, GSD 2.8
  microm) was equivalent to that from the Pari LC+ (MMAD 4.2 microm, GSD 2.7 microm).
  During simulated breathing the MicroAir had a higher total mass output efficiency
  (88%) than the Pari LC+ (68%) (P < .001), and total nebulization time was shorter
  with the MicroAir (6.1 min vs 7.2 min, P = .03). When nebulized to dryness, the
  mass of rhDNase delivered to the filter was comparable with the MicroAir (1.30 +/-
  0.4 mg) and Pari LC+ (1.21 +/- 0.05 mg). CONCLUSION: The MicroAir could be employed
  as a portable nebulizer for rhDNase therapy in patients with cystic fibrosis.'
