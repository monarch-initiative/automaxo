input_text: Direct monitoring of pulmonary disease treatment biomarkers using plasmonic
  gold nanorods with diffusion-sensitive OCT.The solid concentration of pulmonary
  mucus (wt%) is critical to respiratory health. In patients with respiratory disease,
  such as Cystic Fibrosis (CF) and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disorder (COPD),
  mucus hydration is impaired, resulting in high wt%. Mucus with high wt% is a hallmark
  of pulmonary disease that leads to obstructed airways, inflammation, and infection.
  Methods to measure mucus hydration in situ and in real-time are needed for drug
  development and personalized therapy. We employed plasmonic gold nanorod (GNR) biosensors
  that intermittently collide with macromolecules comprising the mucus mesh as they
  self-diffuse, such that GNR translational diffusion (DT) is sensitive to wt%. GNRs
  are attractive candidates for bioprobes due to their anisotropic optical scattering
  that makes them easily distinguishable from native tissue using polarization-sensitive
  OCT. Using principles of heterodyne dynamic light scattering, we developed diffusion-sensitive
  optical coherence tomography (DS-OCT) to spatially-resolve changing DT in real-time.
  DS-OCT enables, for the first time, direct monitoring of changes in nanoparticle
  diffusion rates that are sensitive to nanoporosity with spatial and temporal resolutions
  of 4.7 mum and 0.2 s. DS-OCT therefore enables us to measure spatially-resolved
  changes in mucus wt% over time. In this study, we demonstrate the applicability
  of DS-OCT on well-differentiated primary human bronchial epithelial cells during
  a clinical mucus-hydrating therapy, hypertonic saline treatment (HST), to reveal,
  for the first time, mucus mixing, cellular secretions, and mucus hydration on the
  micrometer scale that translate to long-term therapeutic effects.
