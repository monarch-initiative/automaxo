input_text: 'An Overview on the Upper and Lower Airway Microbiome in Cystic Fibrosis
  Patients.BACKGROUND: In cystic fibrosis patients, the mucus is an excellent place
  for opportunistic bacteria and pathogens to cover. Chronic infections of upper and
  lower airways play a critical role in the mortality of cystic fibrosis. This study
  aimed to introduce the microbiota profiles in patients with cystic fibrosis. MATERIALS
  AND METHODS: In this study, a comprehensive literature search was done for studies
  on upper and lower airway microbiota in cystic fibrosis patients. International
  and national databases were searched for the following MeSH words: microbiota, microbiome,
  upper airway, lower airway, cystic fibrosis, cystic fibrosis, upper airway microbiome,
  lower airway microbiome, microbiome pattern in cystic fibrosis, microbiome pattern
  in cystic fibrosis, upper airway microbiota, lower airway microbiota, and microbiota
  pattern. RESULTS: Streptococcus spp. are in significantly higher relative abundance
  in infants and children with cystic fibrosis; however, Pseudomonas spp. are in higher
  relative abundance in adults with cystic fibrosis. Molecular diagnostic techniques
  can be remarkably accurate in detecting microbial strains. CONCLUSION: For the detection
  and isolation of most bacterial species, independent-culture methods in addition
  to the standard culture method are recommended, and sampling should include both
  upper and lower airways.'
