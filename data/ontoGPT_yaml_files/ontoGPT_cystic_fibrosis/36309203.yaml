input_text: 'Quantifying the effectiveness of ultraviolet-C light at inactivating
  airborne Mycobacterium abscessus.BACKGROUND: Mycobacterium abscessus (MABS) group
  are environmental organisms that can cause infection in people with cystic fibrosis
  (CF) and other suppurative lung diseases. There is potential for person-to-person
  airborne transmission of MABS among people with CF attending the same care centre.
  Ultraviolet light (band C, UV-C) is used for Mycobacterium tuberculosis control
  indoors; however, no studies have assessed UV-C for airborne MABS. AIM: To determine
  whether a range of UV-C doses increased the inactivation of airborne MABS, compared
  with no-UVC conditions. METHODS: MABS was generated by a vibrating mesh nebulizer
  located within a 400 L rotating drum sampler, and then exposed to an array of 265
  nm UV-C light-emitting diodes (LED). A six-stage Andersen Cascade Impactor was used
  to collect aerosols. Standard microbiological protocols were used for enumerating
  MABS, and these quantified the effectiveness of UV-C doses (in triplicate). UV-C
  effectiveness was estimated using the difference between inactivation with and without
  UV-C. FINDINGS: Sixteen tests were performed, with UV-C doses ranging from 276 to
  1104 muW s/cm2. Mean (+-SD) UV-C effectiveness ranged from 47.1% (+-13.4) to 83.6%
  (+-3.3). UV-C led to significantly greater inactivation of MABS (all P-values <=0.045)
  than natural decay at all doses assessed. Using an indoor model of the hospital
  environment, it was estimated that UV-C doses in the range studied here could be
  safely delivered in clinical settings where patients and staff are present. CONCLUSION:
  This study provides empirical in-vitro evidence that nebulized MABS are susceptible
  to UV-C inactivation.'
