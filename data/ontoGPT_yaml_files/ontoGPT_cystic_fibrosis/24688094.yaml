input_text: 'A Burkholderia cenocepacia MurJ (MviN) homolog is essential for cell
  wall peptidoglycan synthesis and bacterial viability.The cell wall peptidoglycan
  (PG) of Burkholderia cenocepacia, an opportunistic pathogen, has not yet been characterized.
  However, the B. cenocepacia genome contains homologs of genes encoding PG biosynthetic
  functions in other bacteria. PG biosynthesis involves the formation of the undecaprenyl-pyrophosphate-linked
  N-acetyl glucosamine-N-acetyl muramic acid-pentapeptide, known as lipid II, which
  is built on the cytosolic face of the cell membrane. Lipid II is then translocated
  across the membrane and its glycopeptide moiety becomes incorporated into the growing
  cell wall mesh; this translocation step is critical to PG synthesis. We have investigated
  candidate flippase homologs of the MurJ family in B. cenocepacia. Our results show
  that BCAL2764, herein referred to as murJBc, is indispensable for viability. Viable
  B. cenocepacia could only be obtained through a conditional mutagenesis strategy
  by placing murJBc under the control of a rhamnose-inducible promoter. Under rhamnose
  depletion, the conditional strain stopped growing and individual cells displayed
  morphological abnormalities consistent with a defect in PG synthesis. Bacterial
  cells unable to express MurJBc underwent cell lysis, while partial MurJBc depletion
  sensitized the mutant to the action of beta-lactam antibiotics. Depletion of MurJBc
  caused accumulation of PG precursors consistent with the notion that this protein
  plays a role in lipid II flipping to the periplasmic compartment. Reciprocal complementation
  experiments of conditional murJ mutants in B. cenocepacia and Escherichia coli with
  plasmids expressing MurJ from each strain indicated that MurJBc and MurJEc are functional
  homologs. Together, our results are consistent with the notion that MurJBc is a
  PG lipid II flippase in B. cenocepacia. '
