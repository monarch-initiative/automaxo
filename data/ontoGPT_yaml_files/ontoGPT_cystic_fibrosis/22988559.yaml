input_text: "Mucus penetrating nanoparticles: biophysical tool and method of drug
  and gene delivery.A method that could provide more uniform and longer-lasting drug
  and gene delivery to mucosal surfaces holds the potential to greatly improve the
  effectiveness of prophylactic and therapeutic approaches for numerous diseases and
  conditions, including sexually transmitted infections, cystic fibrosis, chronic
  rhinosinusitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and glaucoma to name a few. However,
  the body's natural defenses, including adhesive, rapidly cleared mucus linings coating
  nearly all entry points to the body not covered by skin, has limited the effectiveness
  of drug and gene delivery by nanoscale delivery systems. This article discusses
  the recent development of the \"mucuspenetrating particle\" or \"MPP\" nanotechnology,
  and how it has been used to both enhance understanding of the nanoscale barrier
  properties of human mucus secretions, and to achieve more uniform and longer-lasting
  drug delivery to mucosal tissues following topical administration. Drug loaded MPPs
  possess non-adhesive coatings that allow them to rapidly penetrate mucus layers
  through openings in the mucus mesh at rates nearly as fast as they would penetrate
  pure water. Critically, MPPs allow enhanced drug and gene delivery to mucosal tissues
  without diminishing the protective function of mucus. Recent progress in the development
  of MPPs as a biophysical tool to probe the length-scale dependent rheological properties
  of mucosal secretions and as a method for drug and gene delivery is highlighted."
