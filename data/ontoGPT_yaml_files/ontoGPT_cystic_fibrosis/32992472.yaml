input_text: Nebulizer Care and Inhalation Technique in Children with Cystic Fibrosis.Nebulizers
  are used by the great majority of cystic fibrosis patients for delivery of cornerstone
  treatments. Inhalation technique and adequate disinfection and maintenance are important
  for optimizing medication delivery. In this study, inhalation technique and nebulizer
  disinfection/maintenance were assessed in cystic fibrosis patients by direct observation
  in clinic and completion of a scoring sheet. A total of 108 patients were recruited.
  The maximum inhalation technique score was attained by 30.5% and adequate inhalation
  technique score by 74.08% of patients. The inhalation technique score was best with
  the vibrating mesh nebulizer (p = 0.038), while patient age and number of nebulized
  medications did not affect ITS significantly (p > 0.05). Nebulizer disinfection/maintenance
  score was excellent in only 31.48%. Most families kept the nebulizer clean and used
  appropriate disinfection method, but only half of them replaced the nebulizer and
  nebulizer cup at the recommended time intervals. Nebulizer disinfection/maintenance
  score was positively affected by a number of nebulized medications and negatively
  by years of equipment use (p = 0.009 and p = 0.001, respectively). Even though inhalation
  technique and disinfection/maintenance practices were found to be adequate in a
  large proportion of cases, there is still a need for regular review and education.
  The type of nebulizer was associated with improved inhalation technique, but more
  data are required before making specific recommendations.
