input_text: 'Nebulization of PEGylated recombinant human deoxyribonuclease I using
  vibrating membrane nebulizers: A technical feasibility study.Recombinant human deoxyribonuclease
  I (rhDNase, Pulmozyme ) is the most frequently used mucolytic agent for the symptomatic
  treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease. Conjugation of rhDNase to polyethylene
  glycol (PEG) has been shown to greatly prolong its residence time in the lungs and
  improve its therapeutic efficacy in mice. To present an added value over current
  rhDNase treatment, PEGylated rhDNase needs to be efficiently and less frequently
  administrated by aerosolization and possibly at higher concentrations than existing
  rhDNase. In this study, the effects of PEGylation on the thermodynamic stability
  of rhDNase was investigated, using linear 20 kDa, linear 30 kDa and 2-armed 40 kDa
  PEGs. The suitability of PEG30-rhDNase to electrohydrodynamic atomization (electrospraying)
  as well as the feasibility of using two vibrating mesh nebulizers, the optimized
  eFlow  Technology nebulizer (eFlow) and Innospire Go, at varying protein concentrations
  were investigated. PEGylation was shown to destabilize rhDNase upon chemical-induced
  denaturation and ethanol exposure. Yet, PEG30-rhDNase was stable enough to withstand
  aerosolization stresses using the eFlow and Innospire Go nebulizers even at higher
  concentrations (5 mg of protein per ml) than conventional rhDNase formulation (1
  mg/ml). High aerosol output (up to 1.5 ml per min) and excellent aerosol characteristics
  (up to 83% fine particle fraction) were achieved while preserving protein integrity
  and enzymatic activity. This work demonstrates the technical feasibility of PEG-rhDNase
  nebulization with advanced vibrating membrane nebulizers, encouraging further pharmaceutical
  and clinical developments of a long-acting PEGylated alternative to rhDNase for
  treating patients with CF.'
