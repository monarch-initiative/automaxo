input_text: Ciprofloxacin-loaded PLGA nanoparticles against cystic fibrosis P. aeruginosa
  lung infections.Current pulmonary treatments against Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections
  in cystic fibrosis (CF) lung suffer from deactivation of the drug and immobilization
  in thick and viscous biofilm/mucus blend, along with the general antibiotic resistance.
  Administration of nanoparticles (NPs) with high antibiotic load capable of penetrating
  the tight mesh of biofilm/mucus can be an advent to overcome the treatment bottlenecks.
  Biodegradable and biocompatible polymer nanoparticles efficiently loaded with ciprofloxacin
  complex offer a solution for emerging treatment strategies. NPs were prepared under
  controlled conditions by utilizing MicroJet Reactor (MJR) to yield a particle size
  of 190.4+-28.6nm with 0.089 PDI. Encapsulation efficiency of the drug was 79% resulting
  in a loading of 14%. Release was determined to be controlled and medium-independent
  in PBS, PBS+0.2% Tween 80 and simulated lung fluid. Cytotoxicity assays with Calu-3
  cells and CF bronchial epithelial cells (CFBE41o-) indicated that complex-loaded
  PLGA NPs were non-toxic at concentrations >> MICcipro against lab strains of the
  bacteria. Antibacterial activity tests revealed enhanced activity when applied as
  nanoparticles. NPs' colloidal stability in mucus was proven. Notably, a decrease
  in mucus turbidity was observed upon incubation with NPs. Herewith, ciprofloxacin
  complex-loaded PLGA NPs are introduced as promising pulmonary nano drug delivery
  systems against P.aeruginosa infections in CF lung.
