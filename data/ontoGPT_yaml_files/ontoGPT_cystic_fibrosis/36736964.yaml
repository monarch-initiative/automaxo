input_text: 'Airway mucus in pulmonary diseases: Muco-adhesive and muco-penetrating
  particles to overcome the airway mucus barriers.Airway mucus is a complex viscoelastic
  gel that provides a defensive physical barrier and shields the airway epithelium
  by trapping inhaled foreign pathogens and facilitating their removal via mucociliary
  clearance (MCC). In patients with respiratory diseases, such as chronic obstructive
  pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis (CF), non-CF bronchiectasis, and asthma,
  an increase in crosslinking and physical entanglement of mucin polymers as well
  as mucus dehydration often alters and typically reduces mucus mesh network pore
  size, which reduces neutrophil migration, decreases pathogen capture, sustains bacterial
  infection, and accelerates lung function decline. Conventional aerosol particles
  containing hydrophobic drugs are rapidly captured and removed by MCC. Therefore,
  it is critical to design aerosol delivery systems with the appropriate size and
  surface chemistry that can improve drug retention and absorption with the goal of
  increased efficacy. Biodegradable muco-adhesive particles (MAPs) and muco-penetrating
  particles (MPPs) have been engineered to achieve effective pulmonary delivery and
  extend drug residence time in the lungs. MAPs can be used to target mucus as they
  get trapped in airway mucus by steric obstruction and/or adhesion. MPPs avoid muco-adhesion
  and are designed to have a particle size smaller than the mucus network, enhancing
  lung retention of particles as well as transport to the respiratory epithelial layer
  and drug absorption. In this review, we aim to provide insight into the composition
  of airway mucus, rheological characteristics of airway mucus in healthy and diseased
  subjects, the most recent techniques to study the flow dynamics and particle diffusion
  in airway mucus (in particular, multiple particle tracking, MPT), and the advancements
  in engineering MPPs that have contributed to improved airway mucus penetration,
  lung distribution, and retention.'
