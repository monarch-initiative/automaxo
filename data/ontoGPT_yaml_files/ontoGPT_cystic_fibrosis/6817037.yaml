input_text: Comparative ultrastructure of a mucoid strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa
  isolated from cystic fibrosis patient and its spontaneous non-mucoid mutant.The
  ultrastructure of a mucoid strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa of cystic fibrosis origin
  and its spontaneous non-mucoid variant was compared by transmission electron microscopy.
  Negatively-stained preparations of the mucoid strain obtained from plate cultures
  demonstrated dense, fibrous material projecting from the cell. No such material
  was observed in thin-sections or in negatively-strained preparations from liquid
  cultures. Thin-sections of ethanol-precipitated extracellular material from liquid
  cultures of the mucoid-strain revealed a cottony mesh of thin electron dense fibres.
  The non-mucoid strain did not produce such material. When prefixed with glutaraldehyde/malachite
  green mixture, cells of both strains demonstrated electron dense intracellular and
  extracellular malachite green-stainable structures. The internal complexes were
  frequently associated with the nucleoid or cell membrane and were replaced by electron
  transparent areas in cells prefixed with glutaraldehyde alone. Aeruginocins of the
  R-type were observed in mitomycin C induced cultures of both strains. Bacteriophages
  with 'claw-shaped' tail-tips were observed in the mucoid strain. Crystalline material
  was produced by the mucoid strain but only when plated on certain media.
