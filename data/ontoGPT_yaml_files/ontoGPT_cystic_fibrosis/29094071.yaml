input_text: 'Clinical chronic rhinosinusitis outcomes in pediatric patients with cystic
  fibrosis.Objectives: Chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyposis are common conditions
  in cystic fibrosis (CF). Approximately 2-3% of pediatric CF patients per year have
  sinus disease requiring surgery. It has been well established that there is a significant
  negative impact on quality of life associated with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS)
  in the non-CF patient population. However, the impact of CRS on the pediatric CF
  population remains uncertain. The purpose of this article is to review the current
  state of outcome measures for CRS in pediatric CF patients. Data Sources: PubMed
  and EMBASE literature review. Methods: PubMed and EMBASE electronic databases were
  searched using Boolean searches that incorporated mesh headings and plain language
  for quality of life, symptom evaluation, pediatric patients, and sinusitis/rhinosinusitis.
  Studies were included if the study primarily evaluated a pediatric Cystic Fibrosis-Chronic
  Rhinosinusitis (CF-CRS) population and the primary outcome measure was quality of
  life evaluation. Results: The search yielded 34 unique articles. A total of 7 articles
  met inclusion criteria. Conclusions: Despite the high frequency of chronic rhinosinusitis
  in the pediatric CF patient population, its impact on quality of life is not well
  understood. Currently there is a lack of a validated disease specific quality of
  life instruments available to assess the impact of CRS on the pediatric CF patient
  population. Level of Evidence: 5.'
