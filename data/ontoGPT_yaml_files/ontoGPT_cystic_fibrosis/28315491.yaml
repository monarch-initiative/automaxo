input_text: 'Vibrating-mesh nebulizer maintenance by CF patients: Results from a French
  survey.PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: Vibrating-mesh nebulizers are widely used at home for
  cystic fibrosis (CF) treatment, with a therapeutic efficiency closely linked to
  the mesh performance. This national study looks at the maintenance at home by CF
  patients and their families of the mesh of the eFlow rapid nebulizer. Ninety-two
  patients from 34 French CF centers, treated at home with inhaled drugs delivered
  with a vibrating-mesh nebulizer, answered to a phone standardized questionnaire
  specifying the different techniques of maintenance of the nebulizer. PRINCIPAL RESULTS:
  Patients were aged from 2 to 68 years (58.7% of children). They inhaled a mean of
  1.8 nebulizations per day. Maintenance was assumed by patients in 36% of the cases.
  All steps of the theoretical maintenance of a nebulizer were respected in 66% of
  the cases. The mesh was not cleaned in 45.6%, not disinfected or not thermically
  disinfected in 32.5%, and not rinsed after chemical disinfection in 45.5% of the
  case. Only 49% of the patients knew the role of the MeshCare  system in the mesh
  maintenance, and only 39% had already used it when the nebulization duration reached
  10 min. CONCLUSIONS: Efforts about education, particularly for the maintenance of
  the mesh, are needed for CF patients using a vibrating-mesh nebulizer at home.'
