input_text: 'Pharmacokinetics and safety of tobramycin nebulization with the I-neb
  and PARI-LC Plus in children with cystic fibrosis: A randomized, crossover study.AIMS:
  We aimed to compare the pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety profile of tobramycin inhalation
  solution (TIS) using the I-neb device to the standard PARI-LC Plus nebulizer in
  children with cystic fibrosis. METHODS: A randomized, open-label, crossover study
  was performed. In 2 separate study visits, blood samples from 22 children were collected
  following TIS nebulization with I-neb (75 mg) and PARI-LC Plus (300 mg). Study visits
  were separated by 1 month, in which 1 of the study nebulizers was used twice daily.
  Tobramycin PK for both nebulizers was established using measured tobramycin concentrations
  and Bayesian PK modelling software. Hearing and renal function tests were performed
  to test for aminoglycoside associated toxicity. In addition to standard estimated
  glomerular filtration rate values, biomarkers for tubular injury (KIM-1 and NAG)
  were measured. Patient and nebulizer satisfaction were assessed. RESULTS: Inhalations
  were well tolerated and serum trough concentrations below the predefined toxic limit
  were reached with no significant differences in PK parameters between nebulizers.
  Results of audiometry and estimated glomerular filtration rate revealed no abnormalities.
  However, increased urinary NAG/creatinine ratios at visit 2 for both nebulizers
  suggest TIS-induced subclinical tubular kidney injury. Nebulization time was 50%
  shorter and patient satisfaction was significantly higher with the I-neb. CONCLUSIONS:
  Nebulization of 75 mg TIS with the I-neb in children with cystic fibrosis resulted
  in comparable systemic exposure to 300 mg TIS with the PARI-LC Plus and was well
  tolerated and preferred over the PARI-LC Plus. Long-term safety of TIS nebulization
  should be monitored clinically, especially regarding the effects on tubular kidney
  injury.'
