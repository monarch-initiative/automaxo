input_text: "Nonsense mutations accelerate lung disease and decrease survival of cystic
  fibrosis children.RATIONALE: Limited information is available on the clinical status
  of people with Cystic Fibrosis (pwCF) carrying 2 nonsense mutations (PTC/PTC). The
  main objective of this study was to compare disease severity between pwCF PTC/PTC,
  compound heterozygous for F508del and PTC (F508del/PTC) and homozygous for F508del
  (F508del+/+). METHODS: Based on the European CF Society Patient Registry clinical
  data of pwCF living in high and middle income European and neighboring countries,
  PTC/PTC (n = 657) were compared with F508del+/+ (n = 21,317) and F508del/PTC(n =
  4254).CFTR mRNA and protein activity levels were assessed in primary human nasal
  epithelial (HNE) cells sampled from 22 PTC/PTC pwCF. MAIN RESULTS: As compared to
  F508del+/+ pwCF; both PTC/PTC and F508del/PTC pwCF exhibited a significantly faster
  rate of decline in Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 s (FEV1) from 7 years (-1.33 for
  F508del +/+, -1.59 for F508del/PTC; -1.65 for PTC/PTC, p < 0.001) until respectively
  30 years (-1.05 for F508del +/+, -1.23 for PTC/PTC, p = 0.048) and 27 years (-1.12
  for F508del +/+, -1.26 for F508del/PTC, p = 0.034). This resulted in lower FEV1
  values in adulthood. Mortality of pediatric pwCF with one or two PTC alleles was
  significantly higher than their F508del homozygous pairs. Infection with Pseudomonas
  aeruginosa was more frequent in PTC/PTC versus F508del+/+ and F508del/PTC pwCF.
  CFTR activity in PTC/PTC pwCF's HNE cells ranged between 0% to 3% of the wild-type
  level. CONCLUSIONS: Nonsense mutations decrease the survival and accelerate the
  course of respiratory disease in children and adolescents with Cystic Fibrosis."
