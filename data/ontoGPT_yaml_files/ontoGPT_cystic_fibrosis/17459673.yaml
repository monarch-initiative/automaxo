input_text: '[Nebulized drugs: the evolution?].The revival of nebulization as a drug
  delivery route is real. The current delivery systems respond to the new European
  norms, the new mesh-vibrating nebulizers allow delivering drugs more quickly, other
  nebulizers, more performant because of less drug losses and of a better lung deposition
  of the drug, are in progress. Only 12 drugs are commercialized for nebulization.
  All are available in dispensaries, some requiring a first prescription by a physician
  working in a hospital (cystic fibrosis drugs), others requiring a prescription from
  only some specialists as paediatricians or pulmonologists (bronchodilators). Works
  are in progress concerning the diameter and shape of the drug particles (nanotechnology)
  and also concerning the use of nebulized drugs for a systemic effect (vaccines,
  insulin, cyclosporine, anticancerous agents, etc.).'
