input_text: Activity monitors in pulmonary disease.Physical activity is reduced in
  patients with chronic pulmonary diseases. Activity monitors can measure physical
  activity objectively and accurately over prolonged periods of time. Research grade
  and commercially available devices, using accelerometer technology, are being increasingly
  used in clinical studies. Physical activity levels have been found to have a moderate
  to strong correlation with important measures such as pulmonary function, exercise
  capacity, quality of life, and mortality and hospitalizations in patients with COPD,
  interstitial lung disease, pulmonary arterial hypertension and cystic fibrosis.
  Their use as a clinical trial end-point and as a tool to augment rehabilitation
  efforts has also been explored in patients with COPD with variable results. Due
  to the ease of use, economic viability, widespread availability and good patient
  compliance, their use in adult and pediatric medicine is expanding. This narrative
  review summarizes the current evidence of use of activity monitors in COPD, interstitial
  lung disease, asthma, pulmonary arterial hypertension, cystic fibrosis and lung
  transplant patients for the purposes of prognostication, monitoring, outcome measures
  and intervention.
