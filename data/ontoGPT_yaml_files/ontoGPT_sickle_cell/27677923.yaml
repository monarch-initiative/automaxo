input_text: 'Epidemiology and treatment of relative anemia in children with sickle
  cell disease in sub-Saharan Africa.INTRODUCTION: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the
  most common inherited hemoglobinopathy in the world, with the majority of cases
  in sub-Saharan Africa. Concomitant nutritional deficiencies, infections or exposure
  to environmental toxins exacerbate chronic anemia in children with SCD. The resulting
  relative anemia is associated with increased risk of strokes, poor cognitive function
  and impaired growth. It may also attenuate optimal response to hydroxyurea therapy,
  the only effective and practical treatment option for SCD in sub-Saharan Africa.
  This review will focus on the epidemiology, clinical sequelae, and treatment of
  relative anemia in children with SCD living in low and middle-income countries in
  sub-Saharan Africa. Areas covered: The causes and treatment of relative anemia in
  children with SCD in sub-Saharan Africa. The MEDLINE database was searched using
  medical subject headings (MeSH) and keywords for articles regarding relative anemia
  in children with SCD in sub-Saharan Africa. Expert commentary: Anemia due to nutritional
  deficiencies and infectious diseases such as helminthiasis and malaria are prevalent
  in sub-Saharan Africa. Their co-existence in children with SCD increases morbidity
  and mortality. Therefore, preventing, diagnosing and treating the underlying cause
  of this relative anemia will improve SCD-related outcomes in children in sub-Saharan
  Africa.'
