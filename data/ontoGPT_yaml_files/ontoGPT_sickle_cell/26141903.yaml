input_text: '[Vitamin D in children and adolescents with sickle cell disease: an integrative
  review].OBJECTIVE: To review the literature about the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency
  and its consequences in children and adolescents with sickle-cell disease. DATA
  SOURCES: The literature survey was performed through the bibliographic databases
  Medline; U.S. National Library of Medicine and National Institutes of Health (PubMed);
  Literatura Latino-Americana e do Caribe em Ciencias da Saude (Lilacs), and the Cochrane
  Library. The keywords were selected using Medical Heading Terms (MeSH): "Vitamin
  D" OR "Vitamin D deficiency" AND "Anemia, Sickle Cell" AND "Child" AND "Adolescent".
  The search was limited to articles in English, Spanish and Portuguese, published
  until April 2014. DATA SYNTHESIS: Eleven articles were selected among the 18 found.
  In 6 of the 11 studies, serum levels of vitamin D in children and/or adolescents
  with sickle-cell anemia were low. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in patients
  with sickle-cell anemia exceeded that of the comparison group. The low intake of
  vitamin D, seasonality, exposure to sun, increased metabolism associated with the
  hemoglobinopathy, and age increase were factors associated with the deficiency.
  There was an association between a significant vitamin D deficiency and bone weakness
  and painful crises. There was a positive correlation between increased levels of
  vitamin D by supplementation and functional, physical capacity. CONCLUSIONS: The
  vitamin D deficiency in children and adolescents with sickle-cell disease is prevalent
  and requires further studies to demonstrate its association with comorbidities and
  possible benefits of vitamin D supplementation.'
