input_text: 'Feature preserving mesh network for semantic segmentation of retinal
  vasculature to support ophthalmic disease analysis.Introduction: Ophthalmic diseases
  are approaching an alarming count across the globe. Typically, ophthalmologists
  depend on manual methods for the analysis of different ophthalmic diseases such
  as glaucoma, Sickle cell retinopathy (SCR), diabetic retinopathy, and hypertensive
  retinopathy. All these manual assessments are not reliable, time-consuming, tedious,
  and prone to error. Therefore, automatic methods are desirable to replace conventional
  approaches. The accuracy of this segmentation of these vessels using automated approaches
  directly depends on the quality of fundus images. Retinal vessels are assumed as
  a potential biomarker for the diagnosis of many ophthalmic diseases. Mostly newly
  developed ophthalmic diseases contain minor changes in vasculature which is a critical
  job for the early detection and analysis of disease. Method: Several artificial
  intelligence-based methods suggested intelligent solutions for automated retinal
  vessel detection. However, existing methods exhibited significant limitations in
  segmentation performance, complexity, and computational efficiency. Specifically,
  most of the existing methods failed in detecting small vessels owing to vanishing
  gradient problems. To overcome the stated problems, an intelligence-based automated
  shallow network with high performance and low cost is designed named Feature Preserving
  Mesh Network (FPM-Net) for the accurate segmentation of retinal vessels. FPM-Net
  employs a feature-preserving block that preserves the spatial features and helps
  in maintaining a better segmentation performance. Similarly, FPM-Net architecture
  uses a series of feature concatenation that also boosts the overall segmentation
  performance. Finally, preserved features, low-level input image information, and
  up-sampled spatial features are aggregated at the final concatenation stage for
  improved pixel prediction accuracy. The technique is reliable since it performs
  better on the DRIVE database, CHASE-DB1 database, and STARE dataset. Results and
  discussion: Experimental outcomes confirm that FPM-Net outperforms state-of-the-art
  techniques with superior computational efficiency. In addition, presented results
  are achieved without using any preprocessing or postprocessing scheme. Our proposed
  method FPM-Net gives improvement results which can be observed with DRIVE datasets,
  it gives Se, Sp, and Acc as 0.8285, 0.98270, 0.92920, for CHASE-DB1 dataset 0.8219,
  0.9840, 0.9728 and STARE datasets it produces 0.8618, 0.9819 and 0.9727 respectively.
  Which is a remarkable difference and enhancement as compared to the conventional
  methods using only 2.45 million trainable parameters.'
