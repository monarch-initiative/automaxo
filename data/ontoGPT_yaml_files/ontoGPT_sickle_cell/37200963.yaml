input_text: 'Impact of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in individuals with sickle cell disease:
  an integrative review.Sickle cell disease is the most common hemoglobinopathy among
  humans. As the condition promotes susceptibility to infections, chronic inflammation,
  and hypercoagulability disorders, several international agencies have included individuals
  with this disease in the COVID-19 risk group for severe outcomes. However, available
  information about the subject is not properly systematized yet. This review aimed
  to understand and summarize the scientific knowledge about the impact of SARS-CoV-2
  infection in patients with sickle cell disease. Searches were performed in the Medline,
  PubMed, and Virtual Health Library databases based on descriptors chosen according
  to the Medical Subject Headings. We analyzed studies published between 2020 and
  October 2022, developed with qualitative, quantitative, or mixed methodology, and
  written in English, Spanish, or Portuguese. The search resulted in 90 articles organized
  into six categories. There is disagreement in the literature about how different
  aspects related to sickle cell disease, such as chronic inflammation status, hypercoagulability,
  hemolytic anemia, use of hydroxyurea, and access to medical care interference with
  the clinical course of COVID-19. These topics deserve further investigation. It
  is evident, however, that the infection may manifest in an atypical way and act
  as a trigger for the development of sickle cell-specific complications, such as
  acute chest syndrome and vaso-occlusive crises, conditions that are associated with
  great morbidity and mortality. Therefore, healthcare professionals must be aware
  of the different forms of presentation of COVID-19 among these individuals. Specific
  guidelines and therapeutic protocols, as well as public policies for sickle cell
  individuals, must be considered. Systematic review registration: This review (https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/NH4AS)
  and the review protocol (https://osf.io/3y649/) are registered in the Open Science
  Framework platform.'
