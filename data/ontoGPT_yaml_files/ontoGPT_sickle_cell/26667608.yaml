  income countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis.BACKGROUND: Pregnancy in
  women with sickle-cell disease (SCD) is associated with increased adverse outcomes.
  Findings on the association between SCD and adverse pregnancy outcomes are conflicting,
  and the results do not address whether these associations are similar in both low-
  and high-income countries. OBJECTIVES: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis
  to evaluate pregnancy outcomes associated with SCD. SEARCH STRATEGY: The MEDLINE
  database was searched using medical subject headings (MeSH) and keywords for articles
  on pregnancy outcomes in women with SCD. SELECTION CRITERIA: We used full research
  articles published in English that compared women with SCD with women who did not
  have SCD, as controls. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were abstracted and analysed
  using comprehensive Meta-analysis 2.2. The primary outcomes were intrauterine growth
  restriction and perinatal mortality. Secondary outcomes were rates of caesarean
  sections, pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, postpartum haemorrhage, maternal mortality,
  prematurity, and low birthweight. Random-effects models were used to calculate pooled
  odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). MAIN RESULTS: Sixteen
  studies met all of the selection criteria and were included in the analysis. SCD
  was associated with intrauterine growth restriction (pooled OR 2.79, 95% CI 1.85-4.21),
  perinatal mortality (pooled OR 3.76, 95% CI 2.34-6.06), and low birthweight (pooled
  OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.42-2.83). SCD was also associated with an increased risk of pre-eclampsia
  (pooled OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.47-2.85), maternal mortality (pooled OR 10.91, 95% CI
  1.83-65.11, P = 0.009), and eclampsia (pooled OR 3.02, 95% CI 1.20-7.58). CONCLUSION:
  Pregnancy in women with SCD is associated with increased risks of adverse perinatal
  and maternal outcomes in both low- and high-income countries. TWEETABLE ABSTRACT:
  This meta-analysis showed worse pregnancy outcomes in women with sickle-cell disease
  compared with controls.'
