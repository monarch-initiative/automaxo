input_text: 'Impact of Red Blood Cell Antigen Matching on Alloimmunization and Transfusion
  Complications in Patients with Sickle Cell Disease: A Systematic Review.Red blood
  cells (RBC) transfusion is critical in managing acute and chronic complications
  in sickle cell disease (SCD); however, it is complicated by RBC alloimmunization,
  iron overload, transfusion reactions and infection. Several reports documented an
  increased incidence of alloantibodies in transfused individuals with SCD, especially
  for Rh and Kell antigens. As a result, the National Institutes of Health Expert
  Panel and British Society for Haematology guidelines recommend primary matching
  for C/c, E/e and K antigens in addition to ABO/RhD for RBC transfusions. However,
  the evidence supporting these recommendations was cited as limited and understanding
  of alloimmunization in SCD is evolving. To examine the limitations of the evidence,
  we undertook a systematic review of evidence behind recommendations for limited
  and extended serologic and genotypic RBC antigen matching to reduce alloimmunization,
  autoimmunization and transfusion reactions. Searches of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane,
  and Web of Science databases using MeSH index and free text terms between 1976 through
  October 2015 and papers and captured through July 2016 through review references
  in papers, word of mouth, and ongoing Google Scholar and Medline Alerts identified
  303 unique articles. Nineteen articles met inclusion criteria and were classified
  by the Oxford Centre Evidence Based levels of evidence. Strengthening the Reporting
  of Observational Studies in Epidemiology checklists were completed for 18 of the
  19 studies. There were no prospective randomized controlled trials. Sixteen of the
  articles were cohort studies, two were cross-sectional studies, and one decision
  tree model examining costs. Low-quality evidence from observational cohort studies
  supports that alloimmunization prevalence can be decreased by extending serological
  RBC antigen matching. Transfusion reactions are generally poorly and inconsistently
  reported. There was no evidence reporting the effect prophylactic genotypic matching
  has on alloimmunization, autoimmunization or transfusion reactions. There were no
  studies comparing prophylactic genotypic matching to serologic matching. High-quality
  evidence was lacking to support clinical decision making regarding best transfusion
  practices. Multicenter prospective randomized clinical trials are needed to determine
  best strategies for reducing the rate of alloimmunization using serologic and genotypic
  matching.'
