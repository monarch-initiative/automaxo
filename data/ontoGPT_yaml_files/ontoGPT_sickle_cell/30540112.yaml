  WITH SICKLE CELL ANEMIA: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW.OBJECTIVE: To describe the socioeconomic
  and nutritional characteristics of children and adolescents with sickle cell anemia.
  DATA SOURCES: The present study is a systematic literature review based on published
  scientific articles. The searches were carried out using the electronic database
  of the National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health- PubMed. Two
  searches of articles published in the last 20years and without limitation of language
  were carried out. Thefirst one started from the Medical Subject Headings term "Anemia,
  Sickle Cell" associated with "Socioeconomic Factors"; and the second started from
  the term "Anemia, Sickle Cell" associated with "Anthropometry". Thesearches were
  directed to research conducted on humans in the age group from 0 to 18years. DATA
  SYNTHESIS: The final selection was composed by 11 articles on socioeconomic characteristics
  and 21articles on nutritional characteristics. Allstudies included children and
  adolescents with sickle cells disease (age range 0-18years), both genders, and most
  of them of black ethnicity. Families of children and adolescents with sickle cell
  anemia were of predominantly low socioeconomic status. Parents had lower educational
  levels when compared to parents of healthy children and adolescents. Body measurements
  (weight and height) and anthropometric indicators of children with sickle cell anemia
  were often lower when compared to healthy groups or reference populations. CONCLUSIONS:
  Children and adolescents with sickle cell anemia have socioeconomic limitations
  and worse nutritional conditions, when compared to reference populations. These
  limitations may lead to worse growth and greater occurrence of possible complications
  that can impair their quality of life.'
