input_text: 'Psychosocial challenges of persons with sickle cell anemia: A narrative
  review.Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is a severe form of sickle cell disease that primarily
  affects black populations and individuals in tropical countries. This condition
  causes significant morbidity and mortality and leads to a range of psychosocial
  challenges. A preliminary search was conducted on Ovid Medline and public databases
  with a combination of Medical Subject Headings keywords, resulting in 368 articles.
  The articles were screened based on the selection criteria in a nonsystematic method
  by 3 researchers, and a narrative synthesis was done to analyze extracted data from
  selected peer-reviewed article. Mental disorders, sleep disturbances, interpersonal
  relationship challenges, stigmatization, and workplace discrimination were identified
  as significant contributors to the psychosocial distress experienced by individuals
  with SCA and their families. Depression and anxiety were prevalent among individuals
  with SCA, leading to poor treatment adherence, increased pain, and disruptions in
  various aspects of life. Sleep disturbances, including sleep-disordered breathing
  and sleepwalking, were also identified as significant contributors to poor sleep
  quality in SCA patients. Families of individuals with SCA also face challenges,
  including psychological stress, financial strain, and social disruption. Stigmatization
  is common, leading to misconceptions and discrimination. Workplace discrimination
  is prevalent, with a high unemployment rate among adult SCA patients. Comprehensive
  care is crucial to address these psychosocial issues. Early identification and intervention,
  comprehensive support programs, patient and family education, enhanced pain management
  strategies, and integration of mental health into clinical care are recommended.
  School-based support, research and advocacy, and community support groups are also
  important. By addressing these challenges through comprehensive care and support,
  healthcare professionals, policymakers, and society can reduce psychosocial distress
  and improve the lives of individuals with SCA.'
