input_text: Successful prospective management of neonatal citrullinemia. Classical
  citrullinemia generally involves hyperammonemic coma in the first few days of life
  and leads to neurological sequelae in survivors. We report a case of an elder sister
  who fell into a hyperammonemic coma on the fifth day after birth. She was successfully
  treated with intravenous benzoate and hemodialysis, and was subsequently diagnosed
  with citrullinemia on the basis of biochemical analysis. Two years later, a younger
  sister was born without prenatal diagnosis. We monitored plasma ammonia and citrulline
  levels after birth, and again diagnosed her with CTLN1 on the basis of biochemical
  and DNA analyses. There have been few reports of the prospective treatment of citrullinemia;
  however, our experience indicates the need for the prospective management and the
  rapid reduction of ammonia levels to avoid neonatal hyperammonemic coma and subsequent
  sequelae.
