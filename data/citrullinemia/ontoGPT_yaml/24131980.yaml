input_text: 'Liver-directed adeno-associated virus serotype 8 gene transfer rescues
  a lethal murine model of citrullinemia type 1. Citrullinemia type 1 (CTLN1) is an
  autosomal recessive disorder of metabolism caused by a deficiency of argininosuccinate
  synthetase. Despite optimal management, CTLN1 patients still suffer from lethal
  metabolic instability and experience life-threatening episodes of acute hyperammonemia.
  A murine model of CTLN1 (fold/fold) that displays lethality within the first 21
  days of life was used to determine the efficacy of adeno-associated viral (AAV)
  gene transfer as a potential therapy. An AAV serotype 8 (AAV8) vector was engineered
  to express the human ASS1 cDNA under the control of a liver-specific promoter (thyroxine-binding
  globulin, TBG), AAV8-TBG-hASS1, and delivered to 7-10 days old mice via intraperitoneal
  injection. Greater than 95% of the mice were rescued from lethality and survival
  was extended beyond 100 days after receiving a single dose of vector. AAV8-TBG-hASS1
  treatment resulted in liver-specific expression of hASS1, increased ASS1 enzyme
  activity, reduction in plasma ammonia and citrulline concentrations and significant
  phenotypic improvement of the fold/fold growth and skin phenotypes. These experiments
  highlight a gene transfer approach using AAV8 vector for liver-targeted gene therapy
  that could serve as a treatment for CTLN1. '
