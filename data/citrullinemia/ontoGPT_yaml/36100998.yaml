input_text: "Managing recurrent portal steal in auxiliary liver transplantation for
  non-cirrhotic metabolic liver disease. BACKGROUND: APOLT has been proposed as a
  treatment modality for certain types of NCMLD. While the short-term outcomes of
  this operation have been comparable with orthotopic LT, its long-term outcomes have
  sparsely been reported. We present one such case of Citrullinemia type I who underwent
  APOLT and developed recurrent PS. CASE REPORT: A 2-year-old male child with a diagnosis
  of Citrullinemia type I underwent APOLT with a left lateral segment from a split
  deceased donor liver, and his postoperative period was unremarkable. Ammonia-lowering
  agents were stopped 1 week following the operation and the child was discharged
  home on a normal diet. Four years following APOLT, the child presented with altered
  sensorium and seizures. A diagnosis of PS was made. Subsequent to an embolization
  of the native liver's right anterior portal vein his sensorium improved and he remained
  clinically stable on a normal diet. Six years following the APOLT, the child again
  presented with features of acute encephalopathy. Imaging was suggestive of PS. A
  portal vein embolization of the native portal vein was performed and the child's
  clinical condition improved. At 6 months' follow-up, the child remains well on a
  normal diet. CONCLUSIONS: While the early impediments in this technique may have
  been overcome, in the absence of any realistic clinical application gene therapy,
  the debate of long-term phenotypic metabolic correction for NCMLD by APOLT needs
  to be revisited."
