input_text: 'Citrin deficiency in a Romanian child living in Spain highlights the
  worldwide distribution of this defect and illustrates the value of nutritional therapy.
  We report citrin deficiency in a neonatal non-East-Asian patient, the ninth Caucasian
  reported with this disease. The association of intrahepatic cholestasis, galactosuria,
  very high alpha-fetoprotein and increased plasma and urine citrulline, tyrosine,
  methionine and threonine levels suggested citrin deficiency. Identification of a
  protein-truncating mutation (c.1078C>T; p.Arg360*) in the SLC25A13 gene confirmed
  the diagnosis. An immediate response to a high-protein, lactose-free, low-carbohydrate
  formula was observed. Our report illustrates the need for awareness on citrin deficiency
  in Western countries. '
