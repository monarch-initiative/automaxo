input_text: Chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic pseudocyst with adult-onset type II
  citrullinemia. Citrin deficiency, which is caused by a mutation of SCL25A13, can
  manifest in older children as failure to thrive and dyslipidemia caused by citrin
  deficiency (FTTDCD) and in adults as recurrent hyperammonemia with neuropsychiatric
  symptoms in adult-onset type II citrullinemia (CTLN2). FTTDCD and CTLN2 are known
  to complicate hypertriglyceridemia and chronic pancreatitis. Here we report, for
  the first time, the case of a patient with chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic pseudocyst
  with CTLN2 who was treated using endoscopic ultrasound-guided cyst drainage (EUS-CD).
  A 33-year-old woman with down syndrome presented to our hospital with complaints
  of fever, abdominal distention, and biliary vomiting for the previous 2 weeks. Owing
  to her difficulties in communication, although she had been taking a nutritionally
  balanced diet regardless of her preference, chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic
  stones had already been observed at the time of CTLN2 diagnosis at the age of 30
  years. Three years later, a merged pancreatic pseudocyst was detected, and EUS-CD
  was successfully performed. A high-fat diet therapy for FTTDCD and CTLN2 may have
  caused the development of the pancreatic pseudocyst combined with chronic pancreatitis
  in this case. Pancreatic pseudocysts associated with FTTDCD or CTLN2 can be treated
  in a similar manner to those resulting from other causes.
