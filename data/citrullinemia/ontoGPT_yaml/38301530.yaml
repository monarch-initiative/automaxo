input_text: 'Impact of supplementation with L-citrulline/arginine after liver transplantation
  in individuals with Urea Cycle Disorders. OBJECTIVE: Liver transplantation (LTx)
  is an intervention when medical management is not sufficiently preventing individuals
  with urea cycle disorders (UCDs) from the occurrence of hyperammonemic events. Supplementation
  with L-citrulline/arginine is regularly performed prior to LTx to support ureagenesis
  and is often continued after the intervention. However, systematic studies assessing
  the impact of long-term L-citrulline/arginine supplementation in individuals who
  have undergone LTx is lacking to date. METHODS: Using longitudinal data collected
  systematically, a comparative analysis was carried out by studying the effects of
  long-term L-citrulline/arginine supplementation vs. no supplementation on health-related
  outcome parameters (i.e., anthropometric, neurological, and cognitive outcomes)
  in individuals with UCDs who have undergone LTx. Altogether, 52 individuals with
  male ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, citrullinemia type 1 and argininosuccinic
  aciduria and a pre-transplant "severe" disease course who have undergone LTx were
  investigated by using recently established and validated genotype-specific in vitro
  enzyme activities. RESULTS: Long-term supplementation of individuals with L-citrulline/arginine
  who have undergone LTx (n = 16) does neither appear to alter anthropometric nor
  neurocognitive endpoints when compared to their severity-adjusted counterparts that
  were not supplemented (n = 36) after LTx with mean observation periods between four
  to five years. Moreover, supplementation with L-citrulline/arginine was not associated
  with an increase of disease-specific plasma arithmetic mean values for the respective
  amino acids when compared to the non-supplemented control cohort. CONCLUSION: Although
  supplementation with L-citrulline/arginine is often continued after LTx, this pilot
  study does neither identify altered long-term anthropometric or neurocognitive health-related
  outcomes nor does it find an adequate biochemical response as reflected by the unaltered
  plasma arithmetic mean values for L-citrulline or L-arginine. Further prospective
  analyses in larger samples and even longer observation periods will provide more
  insight into the usefulness of long-term supplementation with L-citrulline/arginine
  for individuals with UCDs who have undergone LTx.'
