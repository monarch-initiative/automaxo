input_text: 'Report of 3 Patients With Urea Cycle Defects Treated With Related Living-Donor
  Liver Transplant. Urea cycle defects are a group of metabolic disorders caused by
  enzymatic disruption of the urea cycle pathway, transforming nitrogen to urea for
  excretion from the body. Severe cases present in early infancy with life-threatening
  metabolic decompensation, and these episodes of hyperammonemia can be fatal or result
  in permanent neurologic damage. Despite the progress in pharmacologic treatment,
  long-term survival is poor especially for severe cases. Liver transplant is an alternative
  treatment option, providing sufficient enzymatic activity and decreasing the risk
  of metabolic decompensation. Three patients with urea cycle defects received related
  living-donor liver transplants at our hospital. Patients presented with late-onset
  ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, argininosuccinate lyase deficiency, and citrullinemia.
  Maximum pretransplant ammonia levels were between 232 and 400 mumol/L (normal range
  is 18-72 mumol/L), and maximum posttransplant values were 52 to 94 mumol/L. All
  patients stopped medical treatment and dietary protein restriction for urea cycle
  defects after transplant. The patient with late-onset ornithine transcarbamylase
  deficiency already had motor deficits related to recurrent hyperammonemia attacks
  pretransplant. A major improvement could not be achieved, and he is wheelchair dependent
  at the age of 6 years. The other 2 patients had normal motor and mental skills before
  transplant, which have continued 12 and 14 months after transplant. Hepatic artery
  thrombosis in the patient with the ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, intraabdominal
  infection in the patient with argininosuccinate lyase deficiency, and posterior
  reversible encephalopathy syndrome in the patient with citrullinemia were early
  postoperative complications. Histopathologic changes in livers explanted from patients
  with ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency and citrullinemia were nonspecific. The
  argininosuccinate lyase-deficient patient had portoportal fibrosis and cirrhotic
  nodule formation. In conclusion, liver transplant was a lifesaving procedure for
  our patients. Proper timing for transplant is important because high ammonia levels
  may result in permanent neurologic damage; however, transplant at younger ages also
  may increase morbidity. '
