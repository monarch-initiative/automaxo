input_text: Conventional diet therapy for hyperammonemia is risky in the treatment
  of hepatic encephalopathy associated with citrin deficiency. Citrin deficiency caused
  by SLC25A13 gene mutations develops into adult-onset type II citrullinemia (CTLN2)
  presenting with hepatic encephalopathy. Recent studies have suggested that excessive
  loading of carbohydrates is harmful in citrin-deficient individuals. Here we report
  a CTLN2 patient who showed further deterioration of encephalopathy after the employment
  of conventional low-protein diet therapy for chronic liver failure. Owing to the
  high carbohydrate content, the conventional low-protein diet therapy should be avoided
  in patients with hepatic encephalopathy associated with citrin deficiency. In addition,
  our observation may suggest that carbohydrate-restricted diet in which the content
  of carbohydrate is below 50% of daily energy intake can have therapeutic efficacy
  in CTLN2 patients.
