input_text: 'Liver Transplantation in Children with Urea Cycle Disorders: The Importance
  of Minimizing Waiting Time. Liver transplantation (LT) for children with urea cycle
  disorders (UCDs) is capable of correcting the enzymatic defect and preventing progressive
  neurologic injury. We describe the characteristics and outcomes of pediatric LT
  recipients with UCDs. We identified all pediatric (<18 years) LT candidates with
  UCDs in the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database (February 2002 to September
  2020). Multivariable Cox and logistic regression were used to determine risk factors
  for graft loss and cognitive delay, respectively. Of 424 patients, 1.9% (8/424)
  experienced waitlist mortality and 95.0% underwent LT (403/424). The most frequently
  encountered UCDs in our cohort were ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (46.2%),
  citrullinemia (20.3%), and argininosuccinic aciduria (ASA; 12.9%). The 1-, 3-, and
  5-year graft survival rates were 90.4%, 86.3%, and 85.2%, respectively. Multivariable
  analysis showed a decreased risk of graft loss with increasing weight at LT (adjusted
  hazard ratio [aHR], 0.96; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.94-0.99; P = 0.02), male
  sex (aHR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.28-0.85; P = 0.01), and ASA diagnosis (aHR, 0.29; 95%
  CI, 0.09-0.98; P = 0.047), when adjusting for location (intensive care/hospital/home)
  and graft type (both P >= 0.65). In multivariable logistic regression, waitlist
  time (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.10; 95% CI, 1.02-1.17; P = 0.009) and male sex
  (aOR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.02-2.88; P = 0.04) were associated with increased odds of
  long-term cognitive delay. Waitlist duration is associated with a long-term risk
  of cognitive delay. Given excellent long-term outcomes, early LT evaluation should
  be considered in all children with UCDs to prevent progressive neurologic injury
  and optimize cognitive outcomes.'
