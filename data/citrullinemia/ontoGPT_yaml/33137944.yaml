input_text: 'Dietary Management, Clinical Status and Outcome of Patients with Citrin
  Deficiency in the UK. BACKGROUND: Little is known about the optimal dietary treatment
  for citrin deficiency. Our aim is to describe the management of UK citrin deficiency
  patients. METHODS: A longitudinal retrospective review was performed. Data were
  collected from medical records on presenting signs and symptoms, dietary management
  and clinical outcome. RESULTS: data were collected on 32 patients from 21 families.
  50% were females (16/32). Median age at diagnosis was 4 y (5 days-35 y) with 12
  patients diagnosed in the neonatal period with neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis
  (NICCD), eight later in childhood (FTTDCD) and 12 by family screening based on index
  cases from five families. No patient had adult-onset type II citrullinemia. The
  patient age at the time of data collection was a median of 11 y (1-44 y). 91% (29/32)
  of patients had normal physical and neurological development, 47% (15/32) experienced
  recurrent unexplained abdominal pain and 9% (3/32) episodes of hypoglycaemia. Siblings
  had different phenotypes (5 families had > 1 affected patient). Most patients preferred
  high protein foods, limiting sugar-containing foods. Only 41% (13/32) were prescribed
  a low CHO, high protein, high fat diet (restriction varied) and two used medium
  chain triglyceride (MCT) supplements. No patient was prescribed drug therapy. Twenty-five
  per cent (8/32) of patients were underweight and 41% (13/32) had height <-1 z-scores.
  CONCLUSIONS: patients presented with various phenotypes, symptoms and suboptimal
  growth. Symptoms and biochemical markers improved with age, but height remained
  low in some. More research is necessary to assess the effectiveness of dietary approaches
  in improving clinical outcomes and symptoms in citrin deficiency.'
