input_text: Medium-chain triglycerides supplement therapy with a low-carbohydrate
  formula can supply energy and enhance ammonia detoxification in the hepatocytes
  of patients with adult-onset type II citrullinemia. Citrin, encoded by SLC25A13,
  constitutes the malate-aspartate shuttle, the main NADH-shuttle in the liver. Citrin
  deficiency causes neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis (NICCD) and adult-onset type
  II citrullinemia (CTLN2). Citrin deficiency is predicted to impair hepatic glycolysis
  and de novo lipogenesis, resulting in hepatic energy deficit. Secondary decrease
  in hepatic argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS1) expression has been considered a
  cause of hyperammonemia in CTLN2. We previously reported that medium-chain triglyceride
  (MCT) supplement therapy with a low-carbohydrate formula was effective in CTLN2
  to prevent a relapse of hyperammonemic encephalopathy. We present the therapy for
  six CTLN2 patients. All the patients' general condition steadily improved and five
  patients with hyperammonemic encephalopathy recovered from unconsciousness in a
  few days. Before the treatment, plasma glutamine levels did not increase over the
  normal range and rather decreased to lower than the normal range in some patients.
  The treatment promptly decreased the blood ammonia level, which was accompanied
  by a decrease in plasma citrulline levels and an increase in plasma glutamine levels.
  These findings indicated that hyperammonemia was not only caused by the impairment
  of ureagenesis at ASS1 step, but was also associated with an impairment of glutamine
  synthetase (GS) ammonia-detoxification system in the hepatocytes. There was no decrease
  in the GS expressing hepatocytes. MCT supplement with a low-carbohydrate formula
  can supply the energy and/or substrates for ASS1 and GS, and enhance ammonia detoxification
  in hepatocytes. Histological improvement in the hepatic steatosis and ASS1-expression
  was also observed in a patient after long-term treatment.
