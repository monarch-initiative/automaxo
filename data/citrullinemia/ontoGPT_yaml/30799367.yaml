input_text: The Lack of Hepatocyte Steatosis in Adult-onset Type II Citrullinemia
  Patients as Assessed by 7-year Interval Paired Biopsies. Adult-onset type II citrullinemia
  (CTLN2) is a urea cycle disease characterized by neurological and psychiatric abnormalities
  associated with hyperammonemia. One of the pathological features of CTLN2 is the
  presence of hepatocyte steatosis. The condition progresses in almost all CTLN2 patients
  to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We herein report a 74-year-old woman
  who developed CTLN2 without hepatocyte steatosis. The diagnosis was based on clinical
  and laboratory findings and confirmed by two liver biopsies conducted within 7 years,
  as well as by a DNA analysis, which demonstrated mutations in the SLC25A13 gene.
  We describe a rare CTLN2 case without hepatocyte steatosis in an elderly woman who
  responded well to a low-carbohydrate diet.
