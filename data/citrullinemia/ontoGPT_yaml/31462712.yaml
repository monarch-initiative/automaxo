input_text: The mitochondrial carrier Citrin plays a role in regulating cellular energy
  during carcinogenesis. Citrin, encoded by SLC25A13 gene, is an inner mitochondrial
  transporter that is part of the malate-aspartate shuttle, which regulates the NAD+/NADH
  ratio between the cytosol and mitochondria. Citrullinemia type II (CTLN-II) is an
  inherited disorder caused by germline mutations in SLC25A13, manifesting clinically
  in growth failure that can be alleviated by dietary restriction of carbohydrates.
  The association of citrin with glycolysis and NAD+/NADH ratio led us to hypothesize
  that it may play a role in carcinogenesis. Indeed, we find that citrin is upregulated
  in multiple cancer types and is essential for supplementing NAD+ for glycolysis
  and NADH for oxidative phosphorylation. Consequently, citrin deficiency associates
  with autophagy, whereas its overexpression in cancer cells increases energy production
  and cancer invasion. Furthermore, based on the human deleterious mutations in citrin,
  we found a potential inhibitor of citrin that restricts cancerous phenotypes in
  cells. Collectively, our findings suggest that targeting citrin may be of benefit
  for cancer therapy.
