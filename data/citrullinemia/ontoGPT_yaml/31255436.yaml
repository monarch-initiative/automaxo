input_text: 'Current treatment for citrin deficiency during NICCD and adaptation/compensation
  stages: Strategy to prevent CTLN2. Identification of the genes responsible for adult-onset
  type II citrullinemia (CTLN2) and citrin protein function have enhanced our understanding
  of citrin deficiency. Citrin deficiency is characterized by 1) neonatal intrahepatic
  cholestasis caused by citrin deficiency (NICCD); 2) adaptation/compensation stage
  with unique food preference from childhood to adulthood; and 3) CTLN2. The treatment
  of NICCD aims to prevent the progression of cholestasis, and it includes medium
  chain triglycerides (MCT) milk and lactose-free milk, in addition to medications
  (e.g., vitamin K2, lipid-soluble vitamins and ursodeoxycholic acid). Spontaneous
  remission around the age of one is common in NICCD, though prolonged cholestasis
  can lead to irreversible liver failure and may require liver transplantation. The
  adaptation/compensation stage (after one year of age) is characterized by the various
  signs and symptoms such as hypoglycemia, fatty liver, easy fatigability, weight
  loss, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Some poorly-controlled patients show failure
  to thrive and dyslipidemia caused by citrin deficiency (FTTDCD). Diet therapy is
  the key in the adaptation/compensation stage. Protein- and fat-rich diet with a
  protein: fat: carbohydrate ratio being 15-25%: 40-50%: 30-40% along with the appropriate
  energy intake is recommended. The use of MCT oil and sodium pyruvate is also effective.
  The toxicity of carbohydrate is well known in the progression to CTLN2 if the consumption
  is over a long term or intense. Alcohol can also trigger CTLN2. Continuous intravenous
  hyperalimentation with high glucose concentration needs to be avoided. Administration
  of Glyceol  (an osmotic agent containing glycerol and fructose) is contraindicated.
  Because the intense treatment such as liver transplantation may become necessary
  to cure CTLN2, the effective preventative treatment during the adaptation/compensation
  stage is very important. At present, there is no report of a case with patients
  reported having the onset of CTLN2 who are on the diet therapy and under the appropriate
  medical support during the adaptation/compensation stage.'
