input_text: 'Liver transplantation versus conservative treatment for adult-onset type
  II citrullinemia: our experience and a review of the literature. Adult-onset type
  II citrullinemia (CTLN2), an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a mutation in
  the SLC25A13 gene, is characterized by increased serum citrulline and ammonia levels.
  Patients with CTLN2 also display various neuropsychiatric symptoms. Many individuals
  with CTLN2 are fond of protein-rich and/or lipid-rich foods with an aversion to
  carbohydrate-rich foods. We herein report two cases of CTLN2 treated with living
  donor liver transplantation (LDLT) and provide a review of the pertinent literature.
  Case 1 was a 43-year-old man admitted to our hospital for repetitive episodes of
  consciousness disturbance. Case 2 was a 37-year-old man admitted to our hospital
  because of abnormal behavior associated with hyperammonemia. A definitive diagnosis
  of CTLN2 was accomplished by DNA analysis in both patients, who successfully underwent
  LDLT using liver segments from donor siblings with confirmed heterozygous gene expression.
  Case 2 also underwent conservative therapy with arginine and a high-fat, carbohydrate-restricted
  diet prior to LDLT. Postoperative recovery was uneventful and food was unrestricted
  in both patients. We also identified 77 cases of CTLN2 in the literature and reviewed
  them in terms of outcome of both liver transplantation and conservative therapy.
  The survival rate in patients treated by liver transplantation was 100%, whereas
  that in patients treated by conservative treatment showed improvement from 39.5%
  to 76.5% over the years. Liver transplantation is a practical treatment that fundamentally
  improves patient quality of life after transplantation. However, recent studies
  have suggested that arginine and sodium pyruvate administration combined with intensive
  nutritional support is also an effective therapy for CTLN2. Further development
  of conservative therapy may provide a safer, more affordable alternative to liver
  transplantation in the near future.'
