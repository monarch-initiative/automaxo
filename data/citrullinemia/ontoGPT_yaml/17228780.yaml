input_text: '[Adult-onset citrullinemia]. Adult-onset citrullinemia (CTLN2) is a rare
  hereditary metabolic disorder characterized by highly increased concentration of
  citrulline and ammonia in the plasma, which is ascribed to a deficiency of argininosuccinate
  synthetase (ASS), one of the urea cycle enzymes mainly located in the liver. Neurological
  manifestation in CTLN2 patients closely resemble those of hepatic encephalopathy
  and in the past, most patients usually followed rapidly deteriorating clinical courses
  and died of severe brain edema within a few years after onset. However, in 1995
  the first CTLN2 patient who was successfully treated by living-related liver transplantation
  was reported and since then more than 30 patients had underwent this operation in
  our country, showing good outcomes. No primary defect had not been found within
  ASS gene locus, but the causative gene of this disorder is now identified as the
  "citrin gene", which might act as a aspartate/glutamate transporter in mitochondria.
  Different phenotypes are seen in the individuals with a citrin deficiency: neonatal
  intrahepatic cholestasis, juvenile-onset chronic pancreatitis and hepatocellular
  carcinoma without cirrhosis can precede the appearance of CTLN2. The precise pathogenesis
  of this disease that includes the relationship between the mutations of citrin gene
  and a deficiency of hepatic ASS activity remains unclear.'
