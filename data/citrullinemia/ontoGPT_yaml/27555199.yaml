input_text: 'General anesthesia in a patient with citrullinemia using Precedex as
  an adjunct to prevent delayed emergence. Citrullinemia type I is a rare autosomal
  recessive genetic condition that causes reduced activity of the enzyme, argininosuccinate
  synthase, which is needed for proper urea metabolism. The end result is hyperammonemia
  which can cause life-threatening neurologic symptoms and global developmental delay.
  Previous case reports of the anesthetic management of patients with citrullinemia
  describe delayed recovery possibly related to elevated ammonia levels postoperatively
  or choice of intraoperative anesthetics which have included narcotics. In this case
  report, we present the anesthetic management of a 16-year-old adolescent girl with
  citrullinemia type I undergoing a vagus nerve stimulator revision. We used the alpha-2-adrenergic
  agonist, dexmedetomidine, as an adjunct to avoid narcotics to prevent delayed emergence.
  She was admitted for hydration the night before the procedure and had a baseline
  ammonia level of 33 mumol/L (reference, 9-33 mumol/L). Anesthetic maintenance consisted
  of 2% sevoflurane, dexmedetomidine 0.5 mug/kg per hour, and intravenous acetaminophen
  given toward the conclusion of the surgery. The patient awoke immediately at the
  end of the procedure and was extubated in the operating room. Postprocedure, her
  ammonia level was less than 9 mumol/L. She appeared to be free of pain, was tolerating
  gastric tube feeds postprocedure, and was discharged to home on the day of surgery.
  Effective management of ammonia levels in this patient using preoperative hydration
  and dexmedetomidine as an adjunct to general anesthesia may have helped to prevent
  delayed emergence. '
