input_text: Recurrent liver failure in a 25-year-old female. Acute liver failure (ALF)
  is defined as severe and sudden liver dysfunction leading to coagulopathy and encephalopathy
  in a previously healthy person without preexisting liver disease. Almost half of
  adult cases of ALF are due to acetaminophen toxicity, with 21% labeled indeterminate
  or other. We present a patient with a second episode of ALF, both episodes being
  initiated by catabolic stress. Elevated aminotransferases, jaundice, an elevated
  international normalized ratio, and confusion were typical of idiopathic ALF, and
  a low serum ceruloplasmin level initially led to a misdiagnosis of acute Wilson
  disease. Citrullinemia type I, a urea cycle defect caused by a deficiency of argininosuccinate
  synthetase, was diagnosed on the basis of plasma amino acids and was confirmed by
  molecular testing. Urea cycle defects are not generally considered causes of ALF
  in adults and are described rarely in children beyond the neonatal period. Our case
  illustrates the importance of screening patients with idiopathic ALF for a metabolic
  disorder. A prompt diagnosis and timely treatment enabled her to recover fully without
  the need for liver transplantation.
