input_text: Living donor liver transplantation for type II citrullinemia from a heterozygous
  donor. Adult-onset type II citrullinemia (CTLN2) is a rare disorder of the urea
  cycle resulting in hyperammonemia, with a poor prognosis. Here we report a 48-year-old
  Japanese man who showed abnormal nocturnal behavior. Laboratory data indicated raised
  plasma concentrations of ammonia and citrulline, and a definitive diagnosis of CTLN2
  was made by DNA analysis. Hyperammonemia was not improved by oral intake of branched-chain
  amino acids (BCAA), whereas venous infusion of BCAA was effective. Western blotting
  revealed heterozygotic expression of citrin protein in a liver biopsy specimen from
  the patient's brother. However, as symptomatic CTLN2 is very unusual in a heterozygotic
  carrier, we considered the brother suitable as a living-donor liver transplantation
  (LDLT) donor. The recipient's entire liver was removed, and replaced with the left
  liver graft. The plasma ammonia level remained low without infusion of BCAA after
  liver transplantation. From this case we conclude that venous infusion, rather than
  oral administration, of BCAA is useful for conservative treatment of CTLN2. However,
  liver transplantation is the only effective therapeutic option for CTLN2, and should
  be performed before irreversible encephalopathy occurs. Use of a graft from heterozygotic
  donors is permissible treatment for CTLN2.
