input_text: Use of peritoneal dialysis and mesothelium in non primary renal conditions.
  The management of a handful of non renal clinical conditions includes peritoneal
  dialysis (PD) as a therapeutic tool. Peritoneal lavage after abdominal surgery is
  still performed in infectious peritonitis and cases of necrotizing hemorrhagic pancreatitis.
  Use of PD in active psoriasis resulted in approximately 40 papers reporting mostly
  isolated cases and showing both therapeutic success and failure. That ambiguous
  picture persisted during controlled studies, and interest in treating psoriasis
  with PD faded over the last 20 years. As an emergency tool, PD has been also used
  in the treatment of metabolic crisis resulting from inborn errors of metabolism
  such as deficiency of any of the five enzymes of the urea cycle and other inherited
  disorders of organic and aminoacid metabolism such as maple syrup urine disease,
  citrullinemia, and propionic acidemia. Recent studies have shown that continuous
  hemofiltration therapies have more effective clearances than PD does. Similar observations
  were reported for the use of PD in drug poisoning. Peritoneal dialysis is still
  a valuable tool as a complementary measure in the treatment of hypothermia. Recently,
  prospective work in patients affected by end-stage congestive heart failure has
  shown that maintenance PD significantly lowers morbidity and mortality and substantially
  improves functional capabilities and quality of life in these otherwise terminally
  ill patients.
