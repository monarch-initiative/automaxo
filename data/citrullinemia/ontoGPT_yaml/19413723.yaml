input_text: Liver transplantation for an infant with neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis
  caused by citrin deficiency using heterozygote living donor. NICCD is an autosomal
  recessive genetic disorder, characterized by cholestasis, coagulopathy, hypoglycemia,
  fatty liver and multiple amino acidemia. NICCD develops in the neonatal/infantile
  period and has been reported as a "naturally curable" disease within one yr of life.
  Recently, we experienced an infantile NICCD who developed progressive liver failure,
  and required subsequent LT using a heterozygote living donor at eight months of
  age. Diagnosis of NICCD was established before transplantation, and donor evaluation
  included mutation in the SLC25A13 gene for exclusion of individuals with citrin
  deficiency citrullinemia. LDLT, from blood type identical mother using a left lateral
  segment graft, was performed without serious complication. Plasma amino acid concentration
  was normalized rapidly, and the patient was discharged 30 days after transplant.
  During one yr follow up, the recipient has been doing well without additional medication
  for NICCD. NICCD should be considered in the differential diagnosis as a cause of
  neonatal/infantile cholestatic disease. LT using a heterozygote living donor is
  an effective alternative in countries where a deceased donor is not available.
