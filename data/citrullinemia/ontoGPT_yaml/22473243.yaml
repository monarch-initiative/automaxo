input_text: 'Unrecognized citrullinemia mimicking encephalitis in a 14-year-old boy:
  unexpected result through the use of a standardized lumbar puncture protocol. Citrullinemia
  is a urea cycle disorder caused by deficiency of argininosuccinate synthetase. Late
  onset forms can remain undiscovered until a decompensation that can resemble encephalitis.
  Herein, we report a 14-year old patient with suspected encephalitis with fluctuating
  episodes of confusion. EEG mainly showed bilateral slowing with some spikes plus
  spike waves; and was interpreted as suspicious for encephalitis. Brain MRI was normal.
  Leukocytes in CSF were slightly elevated. Treatment for a CNS infectious disease
  was begun. Symptoms did not resolve and there were several episodes of confusion,
  so a repeat lumbar puncture was performed according to a standardized protocol including
  an amino acid profile. An elevation of citrulline in CSF was found, which ultimately
  led to the diagnosis of a late onset citrullinemia. The establishment of this diagnosis
  will protect the patient from the sequelae of unrecognized and thus untreated episodes
  of hyperammonemia. Thus, following a standardized lumbar puncture protocol can be
  essential to detect patients with otherwise unrecognized underlying metabolic disorders
  that are not suspected because of clinical symptoms. In addition, it is important
  to stress that an ammonia concentration should be determined in any patient with
  neurological signs like confusion.'
