input_text: 'Percutaneous removal of biliary stones post-liver transplant in a pediatric
  patient: Case report and review of the literature. This case report describes an
  8-year-old girl who underwent a segmental LT for a primary diagnosis of citrullinemia
  at the age of 12 months. She presented with cholangitis secondary to stenosis of
  the biliary-enteric anastomosis. MRI revealed dilatation of intrahepatic bile ducts
  associated with multiple stones. An endoscopic approach failed to decompress the
  bile ducts and remove the stones. A percutaneous approach was then undertaken. After
  placement of a temporary external biliary drain for 12 days, a 26 French sheath
  was placed to access the bile ducts. Using a 14Fr flexible cystoscope, 80%-90% of
  the biliary stones were removed. This was followed by antegrade balloon dilatation
  of the biliary-enteric anastomosis. Two months later, the procedure was repeated,
  resulting in complete clearance of the biliary stones. An internal-external biliary
  drain was maintained in placed for 10 months. The patient has been asymptomatic,
  with no evidence of stone recurrence for 13 months after drain removal. Percutaneous
  biliary stone removal is commonly performed in adults with non-transplanted livers,
  especially in complex cases, and has also been shown to be successful in the pediatric
  population. However, it is rarely reported in transplanted livers in adults, and
  to the best of our knowledge, no pediatric cases have been reported. This case illustrates
  that this technique can be successfully utilized in pediatric LT patients.'
