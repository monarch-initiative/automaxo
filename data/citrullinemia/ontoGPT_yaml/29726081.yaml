input_text: Liver transplantation for neonatal-onset citrullinemia. Citrullinemia
  or ASS deficiency in its classical form presents in the neonatal period with poor
  feeding, hyperammonemia, encephalopathy, seizures, and if untreated can be fatal.
  Despite advances in medical therapy, neurocognitive outcomes remain suboptimal.
  LT has emerged as a potential management option. A retrospective single-center review
  identified 7 children with a median age of 1.1 years (range, 0.6-5.8) at referral.
  Five children presented clinically, and 2 were treated prospectively from birth
  due to positive family history. All patients received standard medical and dietary
  therapy prior to LT. The indications for LT were frequent metabolic decompensations
  in 4, elective in 2, and ALF in 1. The median age at LT was 2.4 years (range, 1.3-6.5).
  Five patients received 6 left lateral segment grafts, one a live unrelated donor
  left lateral segment as an APOLT graft, and one a cadaveric whole liver graft as
  APOLT. One child required retransplantation due to hepatic artery thrombosis. Graft
  and patient survival were 86% and 100%, respectively. Median follow-up is 3.1 years
  (range, 0.1-4.1), and the median age at follow-up is 5.5 years (range, 4.0-9.8).
  There have been no metabolic decompensations in 6 children, while 1 patient (with
  APOLT) developed asymptomatic hyperammonemia with no clinical or histological signs
  of liver injury, requiring additional medical therapy. Our medium-term experience
  following LT in citrullinemia is favorable, demonstrating a positive transformation
  of the clinical phenotype.
