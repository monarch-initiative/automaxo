input_text: 'Mucositis not neutropenia determines bacteremia among hematopoietic stem
  cell transplant recipients. BACKGROUND: In the 1960s, it was reported that infectious
  complications were the main cause of fever during neutropenia that followed hematopoietic
  stem cell transplant (HSCT). More recently, mucositis has become recognized as an
  important determinant of the inflammatory response and infectious complications.
  METHODS: The objective of this prospective study was to determine the impact of
  intestinal mucositis, as measured by plasma citrulline, and neutropenia on the systemic
  inflammatory response (C-reactive protein) and the occurrence of bacteremia among
  2 cohorts of HSCT recipients: 1 composed of 18 patients who had been treated with
  a myeloablative (MA) regimen (high-dose melphalan) and the other involving 19 patients
  who had received the non-myeloablative (NMA) regimen (fludarabine and cyclophosphamide).
  Blood cultures were obtained for surveillance from admission onwards as well as
  at the onset of fever. RESULTS: The MA regimen induced severe intestinal mucositis
  manifest by citrullinemia <10 mumol/L, which was accompanied by an inflammatory
  response, and bacteremia affected 8 (44%) of 18 patients and coincided with the
  nadir of citrullinemia. By contrast, those who had been treated with the NMA regimen
  did not develop severe intestinal mucositis, had a moderate inflammatory response,
  and only 2 (11%) of the 19 patients developed bacteremia. However, both groups experienced
  profound neutropenia and its duration was significantly longer for those receiving
  the NMA regimen. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that severe intestinal mucositis,
  i.e., citrullinemia <10 mumol/L, defines the period of risk of bacteremia better
  than does neutropenia, and that measuring plasma citrulline may prove useful in
  deciding who needs empirical antimicrobial therapy and when.'
