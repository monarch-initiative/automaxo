input_text: 'Novel diagnostic approach to citrin deficiency: analysis of citrin protein
  in lymphocytes. Citrin deficiency induces two clinical features; namely neonatal
  intrahepatic cholestasis caused by citrin deficiency (NICCD) and adult-onset type
  II citrullinemia. Hypercitrullinemia is the most characteristic feature, whereas
  there are non-citrullinemic individuals. Diagnosis of citrin deficiency is performed
  by genetic analysis, although the 12 known mutations in the alleles are not detected
  in about 15% of cases. Thus, we aimed to examine citrin protein in lymphocytes isolated
  from peripheral blood as an alternative diagnostic method. We examined 38 children
  having an episode of cholestatic liver dysfunction, 8 heterozygotes, and 11 healthy
  individuals. All subjects were evaluated for citrin protein by Western blotting
  and for the 12 known mutations by gene analysis. Citrin protein was detected in
  15 of 38 children with cholestatic liver dysfunction. Fourteen of them were negative
  for 12 known mutations in both alleles, whereas one patient was found to have a
  known mutation in one allele. Citrin protein was absent in 23 of the 38 patients.
  Among these 23, gene analysis diagnosed citrin deficiency in 19, whereas 2 patients
  were later revealed to be NICCD with novel mutations. In the remaining 2 patients,
  who exhibit the clinical features of NICCD, a known mutation was detected in one
  allele but no mutation was identified in another allele. Citrin protein was also
  detected in the 8 heterozygotes and 11 healthy individuals. We disclosed that citrin
  was deficient in lymphocytes among patients with citrin deficiency. Analysis of
  citrin is useful to diagnose citrin deficiency even in patients without known mutations
  or hypercitrullinemia.'
