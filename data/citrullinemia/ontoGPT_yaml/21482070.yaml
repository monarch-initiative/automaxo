input_text: 'High plasma citrulline and arginine levels ensured by sustained-release
  citrulline supplementation in rats. OBJECTIVE: Dietary-supplemented arginine has
  been shown to have positive effects on cardiovascular disease, but several drawbacks
  exist and could potentially be avoided by using L-citrulline, since it is recycled
  to L-arginine. However, citrulline is very rapidly metabolized. We therefore developed
  a sustained-release form of citrulline and evaluated its metabolic behavior in rats.
  METHODS: Male Sprague Dawley rats were divided into three groups: receiving "empty
  microcapsule" (control group), 1 g/kg/d immediate-release citrulline (IR citrulline
  group), or 1 g/kg/d sustained-release citrulline (SR citrulline group). Citrulline
  was given each day at 9 a.m. after blood samples for 9 d, and on day 10, blood samples
  were drawn every 4 h to study the decrease in plasma amino acid concentrations.
  RESULTS: SR citrulline led to a sustained increase in citrullinemia and argininemia
  compared to IR citrulline, and on day 6 argininemia was significantly (P < 0.01)
  higher with SR compared to IR citrulline. Moreover, argininemia was significantly
  higher in the SR citrulline group than in controls throughout the study and SR citrulline
  maintained high argininemia and citrullinemia, at least over 12 h. CONCLUSION: This
  experimental study provides a strong rationale for using this new formulation for
  atherosclerosis treatment.'
