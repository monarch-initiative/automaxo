input_text: Gene Therapy in Combination with Nitrogen Scavenger Pretreatment Corrects
  Biochemical and Behavioral Abnormalities of Infant Citrullinemia Type 1 Mice. Citrullinemia
  type I (CTLN1) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the
  gene encoding argininosuccinate synthetase 1 (ASS1) that catalyzes the third step
  of the urea cycle. CTLN1 patients suffer from impaired elimination of nitrogen,
  which leads to neurotoxic levels of circulating ammonia and urea cycle byproducts
  that may cause severe metabolic encephalopathy, death or irreversible brain damage.
  Standard of care (SOC) of CTLN1 consists of daily nitrogen-scavenger administration,
  but patients remain at risk of life-threatening decompensations. We evaluated the
  therapeutic efficacy of a recombinant adeno-associated viral vector carrying the
  ASS1 gene under the control of a liver-specific promoter (VTX-804). When administered
  to three-week-old CTLN1 mice, all the animals receiving VTX-804 in combination with
  SOC gained body weight normally, presented with a normalization of ammonia and reduction
  of citrulline levels in circulation, and 100% survived for 7 months. Similar to
  what has been observed in CTLN1 patients, CTLN1 mice showed several behavioral abnormalities
  such as anxiety, reduced welfare and impairment of innate behavior. Importantly,
  all clinical alterations were notably improved after treatment with VTX-804. This
  study demonstrates the potential of VTX-804 gene therapy for future clinical translation
  to CTLN1 patients.
