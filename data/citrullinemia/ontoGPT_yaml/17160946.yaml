input_text: "[Progresses and perspectives in the study on citrin deficiency]. Citrin
  deficiency causes autosomal recessive disorders including adult-onset type II citrullinemia
  (CTLN2) and neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis caused by citrin deficiency (NICCD).
  The responsive gene of citrin deficiency, SLC25A13, locates on chromosome 7q21.3
  and encodes citrin as a liver-type mitochondrial aspartate/glutamate carrier (AGC).
  The mutations on SLC25A13 will result in deficiency of citrin and CTLN2 or NICCD.
  Citrin deficiency was found at first in Japan. However, recently, some of cases
  were identified in China, Korea, Vietnam, Israel, Czech, United States and England,
  and racial differences of the SLC25A13 mutations were found, suggesting the patients
  with citrin deficiency maybe exist worldwide. In this article, authors reviewed
  the progresses in the study on citrin deficiency up to now and put forward authors'
  considerations for further research on it."
