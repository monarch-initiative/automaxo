input_text: Successful treatment of adult-onset type II citrullinemia with a low-carbohydrate
  diet and L-arginine after DNA analysis produced a definitive diagnosis. A 60-year-old
  male, who exhibited finger tremors, obnubilation, and hyperammonemia (409 mug/dL),
  was admitted to our hospital. Initially, we suspected that a portosystemic shunt
  had caused his hyperammonemia. However, his symptoms did not improve after balloon-occluded
  retrograde transvenous obliteration. He was subsequently found to have some peculiar
  eating habits, including a fondness for bean curd and peanuts, and an aversion to
  alcohol and sweets. Furthermore, marked citrullinemia (454.2 nmol/mL) was revealed,
  which led us to suspect adult-onset type II citrullinemia (CTLN2). DNA analysis
  of the patient and his mother, son, and daughter confirmed that he was homozygous
  for the c.852_855del mutation in the SLC25A13 gene, and his relatives were heterozygous
  for the c.852_855del mutation, which led to a definitive diagnosis. A low-carbohydrate
  diet and the administration of L-arginine ameliorated his symptoms. It is important
  to be aware that CTLN2 can occur in elderly patients. Thus, patients who exhibit
  symptoms of CTLN2 should be interviewed about their dietary habits and subjected
  to plasma amino acid analysis.In this report, we consider the metabolic disorders
  seen in citrin deficiency and the associated compensatory mechanisms in relation
  to the clinical features and treatment of CTLN2.
