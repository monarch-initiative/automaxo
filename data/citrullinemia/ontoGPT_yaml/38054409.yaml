input_text: 'Severity-adjusted evaluation of liver transplantation on health outcomes
  in Urea Cycle Disorders. PURPOSE: Liver transplantation (LTx) is performed in individuals
  with urea cycle disorders (UCDs) when medical management insufficiently prevents
  the occurrence of hyperammonemic events (HAEs). However, there is a paucity of systematic
  analysis on the effects of LTx on health-related outcome parameters as compared
  to individuals with comparable severity who are medically managed. METHODS: We investigated
  the effects of LTx and medical management on validated health-related outcome parameters
  including the metabolic disease course, linear growth, and neurocognitive outcomes.
  Individuals were stratified into "severe" and "attenuated" categories based on the
  genotype-specific and validated in vitro enzyme activity. RESULTS: LTx enabled metabolic
  stability by prevention of further HAE after transplantation, and was associated
  with a more favorable growth outcome as compared to individuals remaining under
  medical management. However, neurocognitive outcome in individuals with LTx did
  not differ from the medically managed counterparts as reflected by the frequency
  of motor abnormality and cognitive standard deviation score at last observation.
  CONCLUSION: Whereas LTx enabled metabolic stability without further need of protein
  restriction or nitrogen-scavenging therapy and was associated with a more favorable
  growth outcome, LTx - as currently performed - was not associated with improved
  neurocognitive outcomes as compared to long-term medical management in the investigated
  UCDs.'
