                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Liver transplantation (LTx) is an intervention when medical management is not sufficiently preventing individuals with urea cycle disorders (UCDs) from the occurrence of hyperammonemic events. Supplementation with L-citrulline/arginine is regularly performed prior to LTx to support ureagenesis and is often continued after the intervention. However, systematic studies assessing the impact of long-term L-citrulline/arginine supplementation in individuals who have undergone LTx is lacking to date. METHODS: Using longitudinal data collected systematically, a comparative analysis was carried out by studying the effects of long-term L-citrulline/arginine supplementation vs. no supplementation on health-related outcome parameters (i.e., anthropometric, neurological, and cognitive outcomes) in individuals with UCDs who have undergone LTx. Altogether, 52 individuals with male ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, citrullinemia type 1 and argininosuccinic aciduria and a pre-transplant \"severe\" disease course who have undergone LTx were investigated by using recently established and validated genotype-specific in vitro enzyme activities. RESULTS: Long-term supplementation of individuals with L-citrulline/arginine who have undergone LTx (n = 16) does neither appear to alter anthropometric nor neurocognitive endpoints when compared to their severity-adjusted counterparts that were not supplemented (n = 36) after LTx with mean observation periods between four to five years. Moreover, supplementation with L-citrulline/arginine was not associated with an increase of disease-specific plasma arithmetic mean values for the respective amino acids when compared to the non-supplemented control cohort. CONCLUSION: Although supplementation with L-citrulline/arginine is often continued after LTx, this pilot study does neither identify altered long-term anthropometric or neurocognitive health-related outcomes nor does it find an adequate biochemical response as reflected by the unaltered plasma arithmetic mean values for L-citrulline or L-arginine. Further prospective analyses in larger samples and even longer observation periods will provide more insight into the usefulness of long-term supplementation with L-citrulline/arginine for individuals with UCDs who have undergone LTx.",

However, there is a paucity of systematic analysis on the effects of LTx on health-related outcome parameters as compared to individuals with comparable severity who are medically managed. METHODS: We investigated the effects of LTx and medical management on validated health-related outcome parameters including the metabolic disease course, linear growth, and neurocognitive outcomes. Individuals were stratified into \"severe\" and \"attenuated\" categories based on the genotype-specific and validated in vitro enzyme activity. RESULTS: LTx enabled metabolic stability by prevention of further HAE after transplantation, and was associated with a more favorable growth outcome as compared to individuals remaining under medical management. However, neurocognitive outcome in individuals with LTx did not differ from the medically managed counterparts as reflected by the frequency of motor abnormality and cognitive standard deviation score at last observation. CONCLUSION: Whereas LTx enabled metabolic stability without further need of protein restriction or nitrogen-scavenging therapy and was associated with a more favorable growth outcome, LTx - as currently performed - was not associated with improved neurocognitive outcomes as compared to long-term medical management in the investigated UCDs.",

Although the MRI had shown no gross abnormality, the VBM revealed significantly smaller-than-normal regional volume in the left hippocampus of the patient as compared with 111 age-matched controls. 1H-MRS further indicated reduction of all metabolite concentrations in the left hippocampus compared with those in the right homolog region, with the single exception of elevated glutamate concentration. These results are similar to those of patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), although CTLN2-complicated mesial TLE has rarely been reported. In contrast to TLE, periictal asterixis and interictal slow activities on EEG support another possibility that the patient might have slight metabolic encephalopathy even after the liver transplantation.",

Initially, we suspected that a portosystemic shunt had caused his hyperammonemia. However, his symptoms did not improve after balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration. He was subsequently found to have some peculiar eating habits, including a fondness for bean curd and peanuts, and an aversion to alcohol and sweets. Furthermore, marked citrullinemia (454.2 nmol/mL) was revealed, which led us to suspect adult-onset type II citrullinemia (CTLN2). DNA analysis of the patient and his mother, son, and daughter confirmed that he was homozygous for the c.852_855del mutation in the SLC25A13 gene, and his relatives were heterozygous for the c.852_855del mutation, which led to a definitive diagnosis. A low-carbohydrate diet and the administration of L-arginine ameliorated his symptoms. It is important to be aware that CTLN2 can occur in elderly patients. Thus, patients who exhibit symptoms of CTLN2 should be interviewed about their dietary habits and subjected to plasma amino acid analysis.In this report, we consider the metabolic disorders seen in citrin deficiency and the associated compensatory mechanisms in relation to the clinical features and treatment of CTLN2.",

Patients with CTLN2 show various neurological symptoms with hyperammonemia closely resembling those of hepatic encephalopathy. Since 1990, 26 CTLN2 patients (17 males and 9 females) have been admitted and treated at Shinshu University Hospital. Twelve of the 26 patients received living related partial liver transplantation (LRLT). After LRLT, neurological symptoms soon disappeared, and all patients returned to their previous social lives. Among the 14 patients that did not undergo LRLT, 6 died of intractable encephalopathy or the development of hepatic cancer, but 8 patients have had relatively good clinical courses (follow-up range 0.5-8 years) with oral intake of L-arginine and low-carbohydrate and relatively protein-rich diet. Six patients have been also given sodium pyruvate and the frequency of attacks of encephalopathy markedly decreased in 5 of 6 patients.

While the short-term outcomes of this operation have been comparable with orthotopic LT, its long-term outcomes have sparsely been reported. We present one such case of Citrullinemia type I who underwent APOLT and developed recurrent PS. CASE REPORT: A 2-year-old male child with a diagnosis of Citrullinemia type I underwent APOLT with a left lateral segment from a split deceased donor liver, and his postoperative period was unremarkable. Ammonia-lowering agents were stopped 1 week following the operation and the child was discharged home on a normal diet. Four years following APOLT, the child presented with altered sensorium and seizures. A diagnosis of PS was made. Subsequent to an embolization of the native liver's right anterior portal vein his sensorium improved and he remained clinically stable on a normal diet. Six years following the APOLT, the child again presented with features of acute encephalopathy. Imaging was suggestive of PS. A portal vein embolization of the native portal vein was performed and the child's clinical condition improved. At 6 months' follow-up, the child remains well on a normal diet. CONCLUSIONS: While the early impediments in this technique may have been overcome, in the absence of any realistic clinical application gene therapy, the debate of long-term phenotypic metabolic correction for NCMLD by APOLT needs to be revisited.",

Furthermore, marked citrullinemia (454.2 nmol/mL) was revealed, which led us to suspect adult-onset type II citrullinemia (CTLN2). DNA analysis of the patient and his mother, son, and daughter confirmed that he was homozygous for the c.852_855del mutation in the SLC25A13 gene, and his relatives were heterozygous for the c.852_855del mutation, which led to a definitive diagnosis. A low-carbohydrate diet and the administration of L-arginine ameliorated his symptoms. It is important to be aware that CTLN2 can occur in elderly patients. Thus, patients who exhibit symptoms of CTLN2 should be interviewed about their dietary habits and subjected to plasma amino acid analysis.In this report, we consider the metabolic disorders seen in citrin deficiency and the associated compensatory mechanisms in relation to the clinical features and treatment of CTLN2.",

                    "abstract": "Identification of the genes responsible for adult-onset type II citrullinemia (CTLN2) and citrin protein function have enhanced our understanding of citrin deficiency. Citrin deficiency is characterized by 1) neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis caused by citrin deficiency (NICCD); 2) adaptation/compensation stage with unique food preference from childhood to adulthood; and 3) CTLN2. The treatment of NICCD aims to prevent the progression of cholestasis, and it includes medium chain triglycerides (MCT) milk and lactose-free milk, in addition to medications (e.g., vitamin K2, lipid-soluble vitamins and ursodeoxycholic acid). Spontaneous remission around the age of one is common in NICCD, though prolonged cholestasis can lead to irreversible liver failure and may require liver transplantation. The adaptation/compensation stage (after one year of age) is characterized by the various signs and symptoms such as hypoglycemia, fatty liver, easy fatigability, weight loss, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Some poorly-controlled patients show failure to thrive and dyslipidemia caused by citrin deficiency (FTTDCD). Diet therapy is the key in the adaptation/compensation stage. Protein- and fat-rich diet with a protein: fat: carbohydrate ratio being 15-25%: 40-50%: 30-40% along with the appropriate energy intake is recommended. The use of MCT oil and sodium pyruvate is also effective. The toxicity of carbohydrate is well known in the progression to CTLN2 if the consumption is over a long term or intense. Alcohol can also trigger CTLN2. Continuous intravenous hyperalimentation with high glucose concentration needs to be avoided. Administration of Glyceol  (an osmotic agent containing glycerol and fructose) is contraindicated. Because the intense treatment such as liver transplantation may become necessary to cure CTLN2, the effective preventative treatment during the adaptation/compensation stage is very important. At present, there is no report of a case with patients reported having the onset of CTLN2 who are on the diet therapy and under the appropriate medical support during the adaptation/compensation stage.",

More recently, mucositis has become recognized as an important determinant of the inflammatory response and infectious complications. METHODS: The objective of this prospective study was to determine the impact of intestinal mucositis, as measured by plasma citrulline, and neutropenia on the systemic inflammatory response (C-reactive protein) and the occurrence of bacteremia among 2 cohorts of HSCT recipients: 1 composed of 18 patients who had been treated with a myeloablative (MA) regimen (high-dose melphalan) and the other involving 19 patients who had received the non-myeloablative (NMA) regimen (fludarabine and cyclophosphamide). Blood cultures were obtained for surveillance from admission onwards as well as at the onset of fever. RESULTS: The MA regimen induced severe intestinal mucositis manifest by citrullinemia <10 mumol/L, which was accompanied by an inflammatory response, and bacteremia affected 8 (44%) of 18 patients and coincided with the nadir of citrullinemia. By contrast, those who had been treated with the NMA regimen did not develop severe intestinal mucositis, had a moderate inflammatory response, and only 2 (11%) of the 19 patients developed bacteremia. However, both groups experienced profound neutropenia and its duration was significantly longer for those receiving the NMA regimen. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that severe intestinal mucositis, i.e., citrullinemia <10 mumol/L, defines the period of risk of bacteremia better than does neutropenia, and that measuring plasma citrulline may prove useful in deciding who needs empirical antimicrobial therapy and when.",

His diagnosis was confirmed as a homozygous mutation (Exon 15: c.1168G > A (p.G390R)) of ASS gene. Inspite of being on a protein-free diet and ammonia scavenging treatment; the patient developed recurrent episodes of encephalopathy and seizures; complicated with behavioral issues. The patient underwent living related liver-transplantation from his mother (heterozygous carrier of the same mutation). Peri-transplant management of ammonia and plasma amino acid levels is challenging and has been highlighted.

The end result is hyperammonemia which can cause life-threatening neurologic symptoms and global developmental delay. Previous case reports of the anesthetic management of patients with citrullinemia describe delayed recovery possibly related to elevated ammonia levels postoperatively or choice of intraoperative anesthetics which have included narcotics. In this case report, we present the anesthetic management of a 16-year-old adolescent girl with citrullinemia type I undergoing a vagus nerve stimulator revision. We used the alpha-2-adrenergic agonist, dexmedetomidine, as an adjunct to avoid narcotics to prevent delayed emergence. She was admitted for hydration the night before the procedure and had a baseline ammonia level of 33 mumol/L (reference, 9-33 mumol/L). Anesthetic maintenance consisted of 2% sevoflurane, dexmedetomidine 0.5 mug/kg per hour, and intravenous acetaminophen given toward the conclusion of the surgery. The patient awoke immediately at the end of the procedure and was extubated in the operating room. Postprocedure, her ammonia level was less than 9 mumol/L. She appeared to be free of pain, was tolerating gastric tube feeds postprocedure, and was discharged to home on the day of surgery. Effective management of ammonia levels in this patient using preoperative hydration and dexmedetomidine as an adjunct to general anesthesia may have helped to prevent delayed emergence. ",

She presented with cholangitis secondary to stenosis of the biliary-enteric anastomosis. MRI revealed dilatation of intrahepatic bile ducts associated with multiple stones. An endoscopic approach failed to decompress the bile ducts and remove the stones. A percutaneous approach was then undertaken. After placement of a temporary external biliary drain for 12 days, a 26 French sheath was placed to access the bile ducts. Using a 14Fr flexible cystoscope, 80%-90% of the biliary stones were removed. This was followed by antegrade balloon dilatation of the biliary-enteric anastomosis. Two months later, the procedure was repeated, resulting in complete clearance of the biliary stones. An internal-external biliary drain was maintained in placed for 10 months. The patient has been asymptomatic, with no evidence of stone recurrence for 13 months after drain removal. Percutaneous biliary stone removal is commonly performed in adults with non-transplanted livers, especially in complex cases, and has also been shown to be successful in the pediatric population. However, it is rarely reported in transplanted livers in adults, and to the best of our knowledge, no pediatric cases have been reported. This case illustrates that this technique can be successfully utilized in pediatric LT patients.",

                    "abstract": "Identification of the genes responsible for adult-onset type II citrullinemia (CTLN2) and citrin protein function have enhanced our understanding of citrin deficiency. Citrin deficiency is characterized by 1) neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis caused by citrin deficiency (NICCD); 2) adaptation/compensation stage with unique food preference from childhood to adulthood; and 3) CTLN2. The treatment of NICCD aims to prevent the progression of cholestasis, and it includes medium chain triglycerides (MCT) milk and lactose-free milk, in addition to medications (e.g., vitamin K2, lipid-soluble vitamins and ursodeoxycholic acid). Spontaneous remission around the age of one is common in NICCD, though prolonged cholestasis can lead to irreversible liver failure and may require liver transplantation. The adaptation/compensation stage (after one year of age) is characterized by the various signs and symptoms such as hypoglycemia, fatty liver, easy fatigability, weight loss, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Some poorly-controlled patients show failure to thrive and dyslipidemia caused by citrin deficiency (FTTDCD). Diet therapy is the key in the adaptation/compensation stage. Protein- and fat-rich diet with a protein: fat: carbohydrate ratio being 15-25%: 40-50%: 30-40% along with the appropriate energy intake is recommended. The use of MCT oil and sodium pyruvate is also effective. The toxicity of carbohydrate is well known in the progression to CTLN2 if the consumption is over a long term or intense. Alcohol can also trigger CTLN2. Continuous intravenous hyperalimentation with high glucose concentration needs to be avoided. Administration of Glyceol  (an osmotic agent containing glycerol and fructose) is contraindicated. Because the intense treatment such as liver transplantation may become necessary to cure CTLN2, the effective preventative treatment during the adaptation/compensation stage is very important. At present, there is no report of a case with patients reported having the onset of CTLN2 who are on the diet therapy and under the appropriate medical support during the adaptation/compensation stage.",

Initially, we suspected that a portosystemic shunt had caused his hyperammonemia. However, his symptoms did not improve after balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration. He was subsequently found to have some peculiar eating habits, including a fondness for bean curd and peanuts, and an aversion to alcohol and sweets. Furthermore, marked citrullinemia (454.2 nmol/mL) was revealed, which led us to suspect adult-onset type II citrullinemia (CTLN2). DNA analysis of the patient and his mother, son, and daughter confirmed that he was homozygous for the c.852_855del mutation in the SLC25A13 gene, and his relatives were heterozygous for the c.852_855del mutation, which led to a definitive diagnosis. A low-carbohydrate diet and the administration of L-arginine ameliorated his symptoms. It is important to be aware that CTLN2 can occur in elderly patients. Thus, patients who exhibit symptoms of CTLN2 should be interviewed about their dietary habits and subjected to plasma amino acid analysis.In this report, we consider the metabolic disorders seen in citrin deficiency and the associated compensatory mechanisms in relation to the clinical features and treatment of CTLN2.",

Peritoneal lavage after abdominal surgery is still performed in infectious peritonitis and cases of necrotizing hemorrhagic pancreatitis. Use of PD in active psoriasis resulted in approximately 40 papers reporting mostly isolated cases and showing both therapeutic success and failure. That ambiguous picture persisted during controlled studies, and interest in treating psoriasis with PD faded over the last 20 years. As an emergency tool, PD has been also used in the treatment of metabolic crisis resulting from inborn errors of metabolism such as deficiency of any of the five enzymes of the urea cycle and other inherited disorders of organic and aminoacid metabolism such as maple syrup urine disease, citrullinemia, and propionic acidemia. Recent studies have shown that continuous hemofiltration therapies have more effective clearances than PD does. Similar observations were reported for the use of PD in drug poisoning. Peritoneal dialysis is still a valuable tool as a complementary measure in the treatment of hypothermia. Recently, prospective work in patients affected by end-stage congestive heart failure has shown that maintenance PD significantly lowers morbidity and mortality and substantially improves functional capabilities and quality of life in these otherwise terminally ill patients.",

                    "abstract": "Identification of the genes responsible for adult-onset type II citrullinemia (CTLN2) and citrin protein function have enhanced our understanding of citrin deficiency. Citrin deficiency is characterized by 1) neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis caused by citrin deficiency (NICCD); 2) adaptation/compensation stage with unique food preference from childhood to adulthood; and 3) CTLN2. The treatment of NICCD aims to prevent the progression of cholestasis, and it includes medium chain triglycerides (MCT) milk and lactose-free milk, in addition to medications (e.g., vitamin K2, lipid-soluble vitamins and ursodeoxycholic acid). Spontaneous remission around the age of one is common in NICCD, though prolonged cholestasis can lead to irreversible liver failure and may require liver transplantation. The adaptation/compensation stage (after one year of age) is characterized by the various signs and symptoms such as hypoglycemia, fatty liver, easy fatigability, weight loss, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Some poorly-controlled patients show failure to thrive and dyslipidemia caused by citrin deficiency (FTTDCD). Diet therapy is the key in the adaptation/compensation stage. Protein- and fat-rich diet with a protein: fat: carbohydrate ratio being 15-25%: 40-50%: 30-40% along with the appropriate energy intake is recommended. The use of MCT oil and sodium pyruvate is also effective. The toxicity of carbohydrate is well known in the progression to CTLN2 if the consumption is over a long term or intense. Alcohol can also trigger CTLN2. Continuous intravenous hyperalimentation with high glucose concentration needs to be avoided. Administration of Glyceol  (an osmotic agent containing glycerol and fructose) is contraindicated. Because the intense treatment such as liver transplantation may become necessary to cure CTLN2, the effective preventative treatment during the adaptation/compensation stage is very important. At present, there is no report of a case with patients reported having the onset of CTLN2 who are on the diet therapy and under the appropriate medical support during the adaptation/compensation stage.",

Citrin deficiency causes neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis (NICCD) and adult-onset type II citrullinemia (CTLN2). Citrin deficiency is predicted to impair hepatic glycolysis and de novo lipogenesis, resulting in hepatic energy deficit. Secondary decrease in hepatic argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS1) expression has been considered a cause of hyperammonemia in CTLN2. We previously reported that medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) supplement therapy with a low-carbohydrate formula was effective in CTLN2 to prevent a relapse of hyperammonemic encephalopathy. We present the therapy for six CTLN2 patients. All the patients' general condition steadily improved and five patients with hyperammonemic encephalopathy recovered from unconsciousness in a few days. Before the treatment, plasma glutamine levels did not increase over the normal range and rather decreased to lower than the normal range in some patients. The treatment promptly decreased the blood ammonia level, which was accompanied by a decrease in plasma citrulline levels and an increase in plasma glutamine levels. These findings indicated that hyperammonemia was not only caused by the impairment of ureagenesis at ASS1 step, but was also associated with an impairment of glutamine synthetase (GS) ammonia-detoxification system in the hepatocytes. There was no decrease in the GS expressing hepatocytes. MCT supplement with a low-carbohydrate formula can supply the energy and/or substrates for ASS1 and GS, and enhance ammonia detoxification in hepatocytes. Histological improvement in the hepatic steatosis and ASS1-expression was also observed in a patient after long-term treatment.",

Late onset forms can remain undiscovered until a decompensation that can resemble encephalitis. Herein, we report a 14-year old patient with suspected encephalitis with fluctuating episodes of confusion. EEG mainly showed bilateral slowing with some spikes plus spike waves; and was interpreted as suspicious for encephalitis. Brain MRI was normal. Leukocytes in CSF were slightly elevated. Treatment for a CNS infectious disease was begun. Symptoms did not resolve and there were several episodes of confusion, so a repeat lumbar puncture was performed according to a standardized protocol including an amino acid profile. An elevation of citrulline in CSF was found, which ultimately led to the diagnosis of a late onset citrullinemia. The establishment of this diagnosis will protect the patient from the sequelae of unrecognized and thus untreated episodes of hyperammonemia. Thus, following a standardized lumbar puncture protocol can be essential to detect patients with otherwise unrecognized underlying metabolic disorders that are not suspected because of clinical symptoms. In addition, it is important to stress that an ammonia concentration should be determined in any patient with neurological signs like confusion.",

                    "abstract": "Identification of the genes responsible for adult-onset type II citrullinemia (CTLN2) and citrin protein function have enhanced our understanding of citrin deficiency. Citrin deficiency is characterized by 1) neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis caused by citrin deficiency (NICCD); 2) adaptation/compensation stage with unique food preference from childhood to adulthood; and 3) CTLN2. The treatment of NICCD aims to prevent the progression of cholestasis, and it includes medium chain triglycerides (MCT) milk and lactose-free milk, in addition to medications (e.g., vitamin K2, lipid-soluble vitamins and ursodeoxycholic acid). Spontaneous remission around the age of one is common in NICCD, though prolonged cholestasis can lead to irreversible liver failure and may require liver transplantation. The adaptation/compensation stage (after one year of age) is characterized by the various signs and symptoms such as hypoglycemia, fatty liver, easy fatigability, weight loss, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Some poorly-controlled patients show failure to thrive and dyslipidemia caused by citrin deficiency (FTTDCD). Diet therapy is the key in the adaptation/compensation stage. Protein- and fat-rich diet with a protein: fat: carbohydrate ratio being 15-25%: 40-50%: 30-40% along with the appropriate energy intake is recommended. The use of MCT oil and sodium pyruvate is also effective. The toxicity of carbohydrate is well known in the progression to CTLN2 if the consumption is over a long term or intense. Alcohol can also trigger CTLN2. Continuous intravenous hyperalimentation with high glucose concentration needs to be avoided. Administration of Glyceol  (an osmotic agent containing glycerol and fructose) is contraindicated. Because the intense treatment such as liver transplantation may become necessary to cure CTLN2, the effective preventative treatment during the adaptation/compensation stage is very important. At present, there is no report of a case with patients reported having the onset of CTLN2 who are on the diet therapy and under the appropriate medical support during the adaptation/compensation stage.",

Real-time transcranial Doppler ultrasonography showed a brain edema and high peaked systolic and low diastolic flows in basal, anterior, and middle cerebral arteries; however, immediately after a blood exchange transfusion, systolic flows were lower and diastolic flows were higher. The resistance indices were significantly different (means: 0.58 vs. 0.37; p=0.01). The patient was placed on diet therapy.

Citrullinemia type II (CTLN-II) is an inherited disorder caused by germline mutations in SLC25A13, manifesting clinically in growth failure that can be alleviated by dietary restriction of carbohydrates. The association of citrin with glycolysis and NAD+/NADH ratio led us to hypothesize that it may play a role in carcinogenesis. Indeed, we find that citrin is upregulated in multiple cancer types and is essential for supplementing NAD+ for glycolysis and NADH for oxidative phosphorylation. Consequently, citrin deficiency associates with autophagy, whereas its overexpression in cancer cells increases energy production and cancer invasion. Furthermore, based on the human deleterious mutations in citrin, we found a potential inhibitor of citrin that restricts cancerous phenotypes in cells. Collectively, our findings suggest that targeting citrin may be of benefit for cancer therapy.",

However, citrulline is very rapidly metabolized. We therefore developed a sustained-release form of citrulline and evaluated its metabolic behavior in rats. METHODS: Male Sprague Dawley rats were divided into three groups: receiving \"empty microcapsule\" (control group), 1 g/kg/d immediate-release citrulline (IR citrulline group), or 1 g/kg/d sustained-release citrulline (SR citrulline group). Citrulline was given each day at 9 a.m. after blood samples for 9 d, and on day 10, blood samples were drawn every 4 h to study the decrease in plasma amino acid concentrations. RESULTS: SR citrulline led to a sustained increase in citrullinemia and argininemia compared to IR citrulline, and on day 6 argininemia was significantly (P < 0.01) higher with SR compared to IR citrulline. Moreover, argininemia was significantly higher in the SR citrulline group than in controls throughout the study and SR citrulline maintained high argininemia and citrullinemia, at least over 12 h. CONCLUSION: This experimental study provides a strong rationale for using this new formulation for atherosclerosis treatment.",

Initially, we suspected that a portosystemic shunt had caused his hyperammonemia. However, his symptoms did not improve after balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration. He was subsequently found to have some peculiar eating habits, including a fondness for bean curd and peanuts, and an aversion to alcohol and sweets. Furthermore, marked citrullinemia (454.2 nmol/mL) was revealed, which led us to suspect adult-onset type II citrullinemia (CTLN2). DNA analysis of the patient and his mother, son, and daughter confirmed that he was homozygous for the c.852_855del mutation in the SLC25A13 gene, and his relatives were heterozygous for the c.852_855del mutation, which led to a definitive diagnosis. A low-carbohydrate diet and the administration of L-arginine ameliorated his symptoms. It is important to be aware that CTLN2 can occur in elderly patients. Thus, patients who exhibit symptoms of CTLN2 should be interviewed about their dietary habits and subjected to plasma amino acid analysis.In this report, we consider the metabolic disorders seen in citrin deficiency and the associated compensatory mechanisms in relation to the clinical features and treatment of CTLN2.",

Recent reports of successful DLT in children with maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) show promising long-term outcomes. METHODS: It was a retrospective study. All children with MSUD were paired with either recipients with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) or non-MSUD metabolic disease. Each pair underwent simultaneous liver transplant (LT), where the MSUD recipient received the graft from a living-related donor and the liver explanted from the MSUD donor was transplanted to the respective paired domino recipient. We report our experience regarding the techniques and outcomes of DLT at our center. RESULTS: Eleven children with MSUD and 12 respective DLT recipients were enrolled, one of which was domino split-liver transplantation. DLT recipients included seven ESLD, two propionic acidemia (PA), one glycogen storage disease(GSD) type-1, one GSD type-3, and one Citrullinemia. Post-LT ICU and hospital stays were comparable (p > .05). Patient and graft survival was 100% and 66.6% in the MSUD group and DLT recipients at a mean follow-up of 13.5 and 15 months. There was no death in the MSUD group as compared to four in the DLT group. The amino acid levels rapidly normalized after the LT in the children with MSUD and they tolerated the normal unrestricted diet. No vascular, biliary, or graft-related complications were seen in the post-transplant period. No occurrence of MSUD was noted in DLT recipients. CONCLUSION: DLTs have excellent post-surgical outcomes. DLT should be strongly considered and adopted by transplant programs worldwide to circumvent organ shortage.",

NICCD develops in the neonatal/infantile period and has been reported as a \"naturally curable\" disease within one yr of life. Recently, we experienced an infantile NICCD who developed progressive liver failure, and required subsequent LT using a heterozygote living donor at eight months of age. Diagnosis of NICCD was established before transplantation, and donor evaluation included mutation in the SLC25A13 gene for exclusion of individuals with citrin deficiency citrullinemia. LDLT, from blood type identical mother using a left lateral segment graft, was performed without serious complication. Plasma amino acid concentration was normalized rapidly, and the patient was discharged 30 days after transplant. During one yr follow up, the recipient has been doing well without additional medication for NICCD. NICCD should be considered in the differential diagnosis as a cause of neonatal/infantile cholestatic disease. LT using a heterozygote living donor is an effective alternative in countries where a deceased donor is not available.",

More recently, mucositis has become recognized as an important determinant of the inflammatory response and infectious complications. METHODS: The objective of this prospective study was to determine the impact of intestinal mucositis, as measured by plasma citrulline, and neutropenia on the systemic inflammatory response (C-reactive protein) and the occurrence of bacteremia among 2 cohorts of HSCT recipients: 1 composed of 18 patients who had been treated with a myeloablative (MA) regimen (high-dose melphalan) and the other involving 19 patients who had received the non-myeloablative (NMA) regimen (fludarabine and cyclophosphamide). Blood cultures were obtained for surveillance from admission onwards as well as at the onset of fever. RESULTS: The MA regimen induced severe intestinal mucositis manifest by citrullinemia <10 mumol/L, which was accompanied by an inflammatory response, and bacteremia affected 8 (44%) of 18 patients and coincided with the nadir of citrullinemia. By contrast, those who had been treated with the NMA regimen did not develop severe intestinal mucositis, had a moderate inflammatory response, and only 2 (11%) of the 19 patients developed bacteremia. However, both groups experienced profound neutropenia and its duration was significantly longer for those receiving the NMA regimen. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that severe intestinal mucositis, i.e., citrullinemia <10 mumol/L, defines the period of risk of bacteremia better than does neutropenia, and that measuring plasma citrulline may prove useful in deciding who needs empirical antimicrobial therapy and when.",

FTTDCD and CTLN2 are known to complicate hypertriglyceridemia and chronic pancreatitis. Here we report, for the first time, the case of a patient with chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic pseudocyst with CTLN2 who was treated using endoscopic ultrasound-guided cyst drainage (EUS-CD). A 33-year-old woman with down syndrome presented to our hospital with complaints of fever, abdominal distention, and biliary vomiting for the previous 2 weeks. Owing to her difficulties in communication, although she had been taking a nutritionally balanced diet regardless of her preference, chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic stones had already been observed at the time of CTLN2 diagnosis at the age of 30 years. Three years later, a merged pancreatic pseudocyst was detected, and EUS-CD was successfully performed. A high-fat diet therapy for FTTDCD and CTLN2 may have caused the development of the pancreatic pseudocyst combined with chronic pancreatitis in this case. Pancreatic pseudocysts associated with FTTDCD or CTLN2 can be treated in a similar manner to those resulting from other causes.",

                    "abstract": "Citrin, encoded by SLC25A13, constitutes the malate-aspartate shuttle, the main NADH-shuttle in the liver. Citrin deficiency causes neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis (NICCD) and adult-onset type II citrullinemia (CTLN2). Citrin deficiency is predicted to impair hepatic glycolysis and de novo lipogenesis, resulting in hepatic energy deficit. Secondary decrease in hepatic argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS1) expression has been considered a cause of hyperammonemia in CTLN2. We previously reported that medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) supplement therapy with a low-carbohydrate formula was effective in CTLN2 to prevent a relapse of hyperammonemic encephalopathy. We present the therapy for six CTLN2 patients. All the patients' general condition steadily improved and five patients with hyperammonemic encephalopathy recovered from unconsciousness in a few days. Before the treatment, plasma glutamine levels did not increase over the normal range and rather decreased to lower than the normal range in some patients. The treatment promptly decreased the blood ammonia level, which was accompanied by a decrease in plasma citrulline levels and an increase in plasma glutamine levels. These findings indicated that hyperammonemia was not only caused by the impairment of ureagenesis at ASS1 step, but was also associated with an impairment of glutamine synthetase (GS) ammonia-detoxification system in the hepatocytes. There was no decrease in the GS expressing hepatocytes. MCT supplement with a low-carbohydrate formula can supply the energy and/or substrates for ASS1 and GS, and enhance ammonia detoxification in hepatocytes. Histological improvement in the hepatic steatosis and ASS1-expression was also observed in a patient after long-term treatment.",

Hypercitrullinemia is the most characteristic feature, whereas there are non-citrullinemic individuals. Diagnosis of citrin deficiency is performed by genetic analysis, although the 12 known mutations in the alleles are not detected in about 15% of cases. Thus, we aimed to examine citrin protein in lymphocytes isolated from peripheral blood as an alternative diagnostic method. We examined 38 children having an episode of cholestatic liver dysfunction, 8 heterozygotes, and 11 healthy individuals. All subjects were evaluated for citrin protein by Western blotting and for the 12 known mutations by gene analysis. Citrin protein was detected in 15 of 38 children with cholestatic liver dysfunction. Fourteen of them were negative for 12 known mutations in both alleles, whereas one patient was found to have a known mutation in one allele. Citrin protein was absent in 23 of the 38 patients. Among these 23, gene analysis diagnosed citrin deficiency in 19, whereas 2 patients were later revealed to be NICCD with novel mutations. In the remaining 2 patients, who exhibit the clinical features of NICCD, a known mutation was detected in one allele but no mutation was identified in another allele. Citrin protein was also detected in the 8 heterozygotes and 11 healthy individuals. We disclosed that citrin was deficient in lymphocytes among patients with citrin deficiency. Analysis of citrin is useful to diagnose citrin deficiency even in patients without known mutations or hypercitrullinemia.",

Patients with CTLN2 also display various neuropsychiatric symptoms. Many individuals with CTLN2 are fond of protein-rich and/or lipid-rich foods with an aversion to carbohydrate-rich foods. We herein report two cases of CTLN2 treated with living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) and provide a review of the pertinent literature. Case 1 was a 43-year-old man admitted to our hospital for repetitive episodes of consciousness disturbance. Case 2 was a 37-year-old man admitted to our hospital because of abnormal behavior associated with hyperammonemia. A definitive diagnosis of CTLN2 was accomplished by DNA analysis in both patients, who successfully underwent LDLT using liver segments from donor siblings with confirmed heterozygous gene expression. Case 2 also underwent conservative therapy with arginine and a high-fat, carbohydrate-restricted diet prior to LDLT. Postoperative recovery was uneventful and food was unrestricted in both patients. We also identified 77 cases of CTLN2 in the literature and reviewed them in terms of outcome of both liver transplantation and conservative therapy. The survival rate in patients treated by liver transplantation was 100%, whereas that in patients treated by conservative treatment showed improvement from 39.5% to 76.5% over the years. Liver transplantation is a practical treatment that fundamentally improves patient quality of life after transplantation. However, recent studies have suggested that arginine and sodium pyruvate administration combined with intensive nutritional support is also an effective therapy for CTLN2. Further development of conservative therapy may provide a safer, more affordable alternative to liver transplantation in the near future.",

The end result is hyperammonemia which can cause life-threatening neurologic symptoms and global developmental delay. Previous case reports of the anesthetic management of patients with citrullinemia describe delayed recovery possibly related to elevated ammonia levels postoperatively or choice of intraoperative anesthetics which have included narcotics. In this case report, we present the anesthetic management of a 16-year-old adolescent girl with citrullinemia type I undergoing a vagus nerve stimulator revision. We used the alpha-2-adrenergic agonist, dexmedetomidine, as an adjunct to avoid narcotics to prevent delayed emergence. She was admitted for hydration the night before the procedure and had a baseline ammonia level of 33 mumol/L (reference, 9-33 mumol/L). Anesthetic maintenance consisted of 2% sevoflurane, dexmedetomidine 0.5 mug/kg per hour, and intravenous acetaminophen given toward the conclusion of the surgery. The patient awoke immediately at the end of the procedure and was extubated in the operating room. Postprocedure, her ammonia level was less than 9 mumol/L. She appeared to be free of pain, was tolerating gastric tube feeds postprocedure, and was discharged to home on the day of surgery. Effective management of ammonia levels in this patient using preoperative hydration and dexmedetomidine as an adjunct to general anesthesia may have helped to prevent delayed emergence. ",

Patients with CTLN2 also display various neuropsychiatric symptoms. Many individuals with CTLN2 are fond of protein-rich and/or lipid-rich foods with an aversion to carbohydrate-rich foods. We herein report two cases of CTLN2 treated with living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) and provide a review of the pertinent literature. Case 1 was a 43-year-old man admitted to our hospital for repetitive episodes of consciousness disturbance. Case 2 was a 37-year-old man admitted to our hospital because of abnormal behavior associated with hyperammonemia. A definitive diagnosis of CTLN2 was accomplished by DNA analysis in both patients, who successfully underwent LDLT using liver segments from donor siblings with confirmed heterozygous gene expression. Case 2 also underwent conservative therapy with arginine and a high-fat, carbohydrate-restricted diet prior to LDLT. Postoperative recovery was uneventful and food was unrestricted in both patients. We also identified 77 cases of CTLN2 in the literature and reviewed them in terms of outcome of both liver transplantation and conservative therapy. The survival rate in patients treated by liver transplantation was 100%, whereas that in patients treated by conservative treatment showed improvement from 39.5% to 76.5% over the years. Liver transplantation is a practical treatment that fundamentally improves patient quality of life after transplantation. However, recent studies have suggested that arginine and sodium pyruvate administration combined with intensive nutritional support is also an effective therapy for CTLN2. Further development of conservative therapy may provide a safer, more affordable alternative to liver transplantation in the near future.",

AIM: The objective of this research is to analyse the value of fasting and stimulated citrullinemias in the intestinal function evaluation. METHODS: A case-control study was undertaken, including 11 patients with short bowel syndrome, 13 patients submitted to malabsorptive bariatric surgery and 11 healthy controls. Plasma levels of amino acids were determined, before and after a stimulation test with oral Lglutamine, by ion exchange chromatography. RESULTS: Citrullinemia was inferior in short bowel patients (28,6 +- 11,3 versus 35,5 +- 11 in operated obese versus 32,2 +- 6,6 mumol/L in controls; n.s.) and lower than 25,5 mumol/L in 54,5% of them (versus 16,7%; p = 0,041; accuracy = 74%; odds ratio = 3, 95%CI 1,2-7,6). DeltaCitrullinemia80 (relative variation of citrullinemia at the 80th minute of test) was lower in short bowel patients; its diagnostic accuracy was similar to baseline citrullinemia and also not significant. DeltaCitrullinemia80 revealed a high predictive capacity of a short bowel inferior or equal to 50 cm (auR.O.C. = 82,3%; 95%CI 61,7-102,8; p = 0,038). CONCLUSIONS: In short bowel syndrome context, citrullinemia stimulation test with oral L-glutamine is feasible and it may improve the predictive capacity of severity. Further investigation is required to determine its clinical relevance and applicability.",

                    "abstract": "Identification of the genes responsible for adult-onset type II citrullinemia (CTLN2) and citrin protein function have enhanced our understanding of citrin deficiency. Citrin deficiency is characterized by 1) neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis caused by citrin deficiency (NICCD); 2) adaptation/compensation stage with unique food preference from childhood to adulthood; and 3) CTLN2. The treatment of NICCD aims to prevent the progression of cholestasis, and it includes medium chain triglycerides (MCT) milk and lactose-free milk, in addition to medications (e.g., vitamin K2, lipid-soluble vitamins and ursodeoxycholic acid). Spontaneous remission around the age of one is common in NICCD, though prolonged cholestasis can lead to irreversible liver failure and may require liver transplantation. The adaptation/compensation stage (after one year of age) is characterized by the various signs and symptoms such as hypoglycemia, fatty liver, easy fatigability, weight loss, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Some poorly-controlled patients show failure to thrive and dyslipidemia caused by citrin deficiency (FTTDCD). Diet therapy is the key in the adaptation/compensation stage. Protein- and fat-rich diet with a protein: fat: carbohydrate ratio being 15-25%: 40-50%: 30-40% along with the appropriate energy intake is recommended. The use of MCT oil and sodium pyruvate is also effective. The toxicity of carbohydrate is well known in the progression to CTLN2 if the consumption is over a long term or intense. Alcohol can also trigger CTLN2. Continuous intravenous hyperalimentation with high glucose concentration needs to be avoided. Administration of Glyceol  (an osmotic agent containing glycerol and fructose) is contraindicated. Because the intense treatment such as liver transplantation may become necessary to cure CTLN2, the effective preventative treatment during the adaptation/compensation stage is very important. At present, there is no report of a case with patients reported having the onset of CTLN2 who are on the diet therapy and under the appropriate medical support during the adaptation/compensation stage.",

Patients presented with late-onset ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, argininosuccinate lyase deficiency, and citrullinemia. Maximum pretransplant ammonia levels were between 232 and 400 mumol/L (normal range is 18-72 mumol/L), and maximum posttransplant values were 52 to 94 mumol/L. All patients stopped medical treatment and dietary protein restriction for urea cycle defects after transplant. The patient with late-onset ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency already had motor deficits related to recurrent hyperammonemia attacks pretransplant. A major improvement could not be achieved, and he is wheelchair dependent at the age of 6 years. The other 2 patients had normal motor and mental skills before transplant, which have continued 12 and 14 months after transplant. Hepatic artery thrombosis in the patient with the ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, intraabdominal infection in the patient with argininosuccinate lyase deficiency, and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome in the patient with citrullinemia were early postoperative complications. Histopathologic changes in livers explanted from patients with ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency and citrullinemia were nonspecific. The argininosuccinate lyase-deficient patient had portoportal fibrosis and cirrhotic nodule formation. In conclusion, liver transplant was a lifesaving procedure for our patients. Proper timing for transplant is important because high ammonia levels may result in permanent neurologic damage; however, transplant at younger ages also may increase morbidity. ",

Patients with CTLN2 show various neurological symptoms with hyperammonemia closely resembling those of hepatic encephalopathy. Since 1990, 26 CTLN2 patients (17 males and 9 females) have been admitted and treated at Shinshu University Hospital. Twelve of the 26 patients received living related partial liver transplantation (LRLT). After LRLT, neurological symptoms soon disappeared, and all patients returned to their previous social lives. Among the 14 patients that did not undergo LRLT, 6 died of intractable encephalopathy or the development of hepatic cancer, but 8 patients have had relatively good clinical courses (follow-up range 0.5-8 years) with oral intake of L-arginine and low-carbohydrate and relatively protein-rich diet. Six patients have been also given sodium pyruvate and the frequency of attacks of encephalopathy markedly decreased in 5 of 6 patients. Our observations indicated that liver transplantation is a very promising type of therapy but that other therapeutic approaches, including low-carbohydrate diet and pyruvate, are being established.",

Here we report a 48-year-old Japanese man who showed abnormal nocturnal behavior. Laboratory data indicated raised plasma concentrations of ammonia and citrulline, and a definitive diagnosis of CTLN2 was made by DNA analysis. Hyperammonemia was not improved by oral intake of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), whereas venous infusion of BCAA was effective. Western blotting revealed heterozygotic expression of citrin protein in a liver biopsy specimen from the patient's brother. However, as symptomatic CTLN2 is very unusual in a heterozygotic carrier, we considered the brother suitable as a living-donor liver transplantation (LDLT) donor. The recipient's entire liver was removed, and replaced with the left liver graft. The plasma ammonia level remained low without infusion of BCAA after liver transplantation. From this case we conclude that venous infusion, rather than oral administration, of BCAA is useful for conservative treatment of CTLN2. However, liver transplantation is the only effective therapeutic option for CTLN2, and should be performed before irreversible encephalopathy occurs. Use of a graft from heterozygotic donors is permissible treatment for CTLN2.",

Patients with CTLN2 show various neurological symptoms with hyperammonemia closely resembling those of hepatic encephalopathy. Since 1990, 26 CTLN2 patients (17 males and 9 females) have been admitted and treated at Shinshu University Hospital. Twelve of the 26 patients received living related partial liver transplantation (LRLT). After LRLT, neurological symptoms soon disappeared, and all patients returned to their previous social lives. Among the 14 patients that did not undergo LRLT, 6 died of intractable encephalopathy or the development of hepatic cancer, but 8 patients have had relatively good clinical courses (follow-up range 0.5-8 years) with oral intake of L-arginine and low-carbohydrate and relatively protein-rich diet. Six patients have been also given sodium pyruvate and the frequency of attacks of encephalopathy markedly decreased in 5 of 6 patients. Our observations indicated that liver transplantation is a very promising type of therapy but that other therapeutic approaches, including low-carbohydrate diet and pyruvate, are being established.",

Initially, we suspected that a portosystemic shunt had caused his hyperammonemia. However, his symptoms did not improve after balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration. He was subsequently found to have some peculiar eating habits, including a fondness for bean curd and peanuts, and an aversion to alcohol and sweets. Furthermore, marked citrullinemia (454.2 nmol/mL) was revealed, which led us to suspect adult-onset type II citrullinemia (CTLN2). DNA analysis of the patient and his mother, son, and daughter confirmed that he was homozygous for the c.852_855del mutation in the SLC25A13 gene, and his relatives were heterozygous for the c.852_855del mutation, which led to a definitive diagnosis. A low-carbohydrate diet and the administration of L-arginine ameliorated his symptoms. It is important to be aware that CTLN2 can occur in elderly patients. Thus, patients who exhibit symptoms of CTLN2 should be interviewed about their dietary habits and subjected to plasma amino acid analysis.In this report, we consider the metabolic disorders seen in citrin deficiency and the associated compensatory mechanisms in relation to the clinical features and treatment of CTLN2.",

More recently, mucositis has become recognized as an important determinant of the inflammatory response and infectious complications. METHODS: The objective of this prospective study was to determine the impact of intestinal mucositis, as measured by plasma citrulline, and neutropenia on the systemic inflammatory response (C-reactive protein) and the occurrence of bacteremia among 2 cohorts of HSCT recipients: 1 composed of 18 patients who had been treated with a myeloablative (MA) regimen (high-dose melphalan) and the other involving 19 patients who had received the non-myeloablative (NMA) regimen (fludarabine and cyclophosphamide). Blood cultures were obtained for surveillance from admission onwards as well as at the onset of fever. RESULTS: The MA regimen induced severe intestinal mucositis manifest by citrullinemia <10 mumol/L, which was accompanied by an inflammatory response, and bacteremia affected 8 (44%) of 18 patients and coincided with the nadir of citrullinemia. By contrast, those who had been treated with the NMA regimen did not develop severe intestinal mucositis, had a moderate inflammatory response, and only 2 (11%) of the 19 patients developed bacteremia. However, both groups experienced profound neutropenia and its duration was significantly longer for those receiving the NMA regimen. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that severe intestinal mucositis, i.e., citrullinemia <10 mumol/L, defines the period of risk of bacteremia better than does neutropenia, and that measuring plasma citrulline may prove useful in deciding who needs empirical antimicrobial therapy and when.",

A retrospective single-center review identified 7 children with a median age of 1.1 years (range, 0.6-5.8) at referral. Five children presented clinically, and 2 were treated prospectively from birth due to positive family history. All patients received standard medical and dietary therapy prior to LT. The indications for LT were frequent metabolic decompensations in 4, elective in 2, and ALF in 1. The median age at LT was 2.4 years (range, 1.3-6.5). Five patients received 6 left lateral segment grafts, one a live unrelated donor left lateral segment as an APOLT graft, and one a cadaveric whole liver graft as APOLT. One child required retransplantation due to hepatic artery thrombosis. Graft and patient survival were 86% and 100%, respectively. Median follow-up is 3.1 years (range, 0.1-4.1), and the median age at follow-up is 5.5 years (range, 4.0-9.8). There have been no metabolic decompensations in 6 children, while 1 patient (with APOLT) developed asymptomatic hyperammonemia with no clinical or histological signs of liver injury, requiring additional medical therapy.

However, there is a paucity of systematic analysis on the effects of LTx on health-related outcome parameters as compared to individuals with comparable severity who are medically managed. METHODS: We investigated the effects of LTx and medical management on validated health-related outcome parameters including the metabolic disease course, linear growth, and neurocognitive outcomes. Individuals were stratified into \"severe\" and \"attenuated\" categories based on the genotype-specific and validated in vitro enzyme activity. RESULTS: LTx enabled metabolic stability by prevention of further HAE after transplantation, and was associated with a more favorable growth outcome as compared to individuals remaining under medical management. However, neurocognitive outcome in individuals with LTx did not differ from the medically managed counterparts as reflected by the frequency of motor abnormality and cognitive standard deviation score at last observation. CONCLUSION: Whereas LTx enabled metabolic stability without further need of protein restriction or nitrogen-scavenging therapy and was associated with a more favorable growth outcome, LTx - as currently performed - was not associated with improved neurocognitive outcomes as compared to long-term medical management in the investigated UCDs.",

In those cases, rapid metabolic investigations and adequate treatment may avoid the need for liver transplantation. We report two patients who presented with acute liver failure and were referred to our center for liver transplantation work-up. Urgent metabolic investigations revealed citrullinemia type I. Treatment for citrullinemia type I avoided the need for liver transplantation. Acute liver failure as a presentation of citrullinemia type I has not previously been reported in young children. Although acute liver failure has occasionally been described in other urea cycle disorders, these disorders may be underestimated as a cause. Timely diagnosis and treatment of these disorders may avoid liver transplantation and improve clinical outcome. Therefore, urea cycle disorders should be included in the differential diagnosis in young children presenting with acute liver failure. ",

Almost half of adult cases of ALF are due to acetaminophen toxicity, with 21% labeled indeterminate or other. We present a patient with a second episode of ALF, both episodes being initiated by catabolic stress. Elevated aminotransferases, jaundice, an elevated international normalized ratio, and confusion were typical of idiopathic ALF, and a low serum ceruloplasmin level initially led to a misdiagnosis of acute Wilson disease. Citrullinemia type I, a urea cycle defect caused by a deficiency of argininosuccinate synthetase, was diagnosed on the basis of plasma amino acids and was confirmed by molecular testing. Urea cycle defects are not generally considered causes of ALF in adults and are described rarely in children beyond the neonatal period. Our case illustrates the importance of screening patients with idiopathic ALF for a metabolic disorder. A prompt diagnosis and timely treatment enabled her to recover fully without the need for liver transplantation.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In the 1960s, it was reported that infectious complications were the main cause of fever during neutropenia that followed hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). More recently, mucositis has become recognized as an important determinant of the inflammatory response and infectious complications. METHODS: The objective of this prospective study was to determine the impact of intestinal mucositis, as measured by plasma citrulline, and neutropenia on the systemic inflammatory response (C-reactive protein) and the occurrence of bacteremia among 2 cohorts of HSCT recipients: 1 composed of 18 patients who had been treated with a myeloablative (MA) regimen (high-dose melphalan) and the other involving 19 patients who had received the non-myeloablative (NMA) regimen (fludarabine and cyclophosphamide). Blood cultures were obtained for surveillance from admission onwards as well as at the onset of fever. RESULTS: The MA regimen induced severe intestinal mucositis manifest by citrullinemia <10 mumol/L, which was accompanied by an inflammatory response, and bacteremia affected 8 (44%) of 18 patients and coincided with the nadir of citrullinemia. By contrast, those who had been treated with the NMA regimen did not develop severe intestinal mucositis, had a moderate inflammatory response, and only 2 (11%) of the 19 patients developed bacteremia. However, both groups experienced profound neutropenia and its duration was significantly longer for those receiving the NMA regimen. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that severe intestinal mucositis, i.e., citrullinemia <10 mumol/L, defines the period of risk of bacteremia better than does neutropenia, and that measuring plasma citrulline may prove useful in deciding who needs empirical antimicrobial therapy and when.",

Here we report a 48-year-old Japanese man who showed abnormal nocturnal behavior. Laboratory data indicated raised plasma concentrations of ammonia and citrulline, and a definitive diagnosis of CTLN2 was made by DNA analysis. Hyperammonemia was not improved by oral intake of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), whereas venous infusion of BCAA was effective. Western blotting revealed heterozygotic expression of citrin protein in a liver biopsy specimen from the patient's brother. However, as symptomatic CTLN2 is very unusual in a heterozygotic carrier, we considered the brother suitable as a living-donor liver transplantation (LDLT) donor. The recipient's entire liver was removed, and replaced with the left liver graft. The plasma ammonia level remained low without infusion of BCAA after liver transplantation. From this case we conclude that venous infusion, rather than oral administration, of BCAA is useful for conservative treatment of CTLN2. However, liver transplantation is the only effective therapeutic option for CTLN2, and should be performed before irreversible encephalopathy occurs. Use of a graft from heterozygotic donors is permissible treatment for CTLN2.",

Patients with CTLN2 show various neurological symptoms with hyperammonemia closely resembling those of hepatic encephalopathy. Since 1990, 26 CTLN2 patients (17 males and 9 females) have been admitted and treated at Shinshu University Hospital. Twelve of the 26 patients received living related partial liver transplantation (LRLT). After LRLT, neurological symptoms soon disappeared, and all patients returned to their previous social lives. Among the 14 patients that did not undergo LRLT, 6 died of intractable encephalopathy or the development of hepatic cancer, but 8 patients have had relatively good clinical courses (follow-up range 0.5-8 years) with oral intake of L-arginine and low-carbohydrate and relatively protein-rich diet. Six patients have been also given sodium pyruvate and the frequency of attacks of encephalopathy markedly decreased in 5 of 6 patients. Our observations indicated that liver transplantation is a very promising type of therapy but that other therapeutic approaches, including low-carbohydrate diet and pyruvate, are being established.",

METHODS: Neonates treated with PD in our neonatal intensive care unit during 2007-2010 were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: Among 4036 hospitalized neonates; 20 neonates (0.5%) who underwent 21 cycles of PD [7 preterm, 13 term; 13 female, 7 male] were included. The mean birth weight was 2930.2 +- 720.6 g (1120-4570), mean gestational age was 37.5 +- 3.5 weeks (27-41). The etiologic disorders included inborn errors of metabolism (propionic acidemia, methylmalonic acidemia, citrullinemia, glutaric aciduria type 2, maple syrup urine disease, 10), or acute renal failure secondary to perinatal asphyxia (4), sepsis (2), prematurity (2), hypoplastic left heart syndrome (1), kernicterus (1). The complications included peritonitis (2), early leakage (4), hemorrhage (1), catheter removal (3) and occlusion (2). The mortality rate was 50%. The gestational ages and birth weights of surviving neonates were higher (p < 0.05). Among surviving neonates, chronic renal failure (1), severe (4) and moderate neuromotor impairment (2) developed within 4-43 months. CONCLUSION: PD, although invasive, is an effective therapy in neonates. The complexity and invasiveness of the procedure is probably responsible for high rate of complications and mortality. If appropriate catheter selection and technique in the placement should be done, PD might improve outcome.",

METHODS: Neonates treated with PD in our neonatal intensive care unit during 2007-2010 were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: Among 4036 hospitalized neonates; 20 neonates (0.5%) who underwent 21 cycles of PD [7 preterm, 13 term; 13 female, 7 male] were included. The mean birth weight was 2930.2 +- 720.6 g (1120-4570), mean gestational age was 37.5 +- 3.5 weeks (27-41). The etiologic disorders included inborn errors of metabolism (propionic acidemia, methylmalonic acidemia, citrullinemia, glutaric aciduria type 2, maple syrup urine disease, 10), or acute renal failure secondary to perinatal asphyxia (4), sepsis (2), prematurity (2), hypoplastic left heart syndrome (1), kernicterus (1). The complications included peritonitis (2), early leakage (4), hemorrhage (1), catheter removal (3) and occlusion (2). The mortality rate was 50%. The gestational ages and birth weights of surviving neonates were higher (p < 0.05). Among surviving neonates, chronic renal failure (1), severe (4) and moderate neuromotor impairment (2) developed within 4-43 months. CONCLUSION: PD, although invasive, is an effective therapy in neonates. The complexity and invasiveness of the procedure is probably responsible for high rate of complications and mortality. If appropriate catheter selection and technique in the placement should be done, PD might improve outcome.",

Peritoneal lavage after abdominal surgery is still performed in infectious peritonitis and cases of necrotizing hemorrhagic pancreatitis. Use of PD in active psoriasis resulted in approximately 40 papers reporting mostly isolated cases and showing both therapeutic success and failure. That ambiguous picture persisted during controlled studies, and interest in treating psoriasis with PD faded over the last 20 years. As an emergency tool, PD has been also used in the treatment of metabolic crisis resulting from inborn errors of metabolism such as deficiency of any of the five enzymes of the urea cycle and other inherited disorders of organic and aminoacid metabolism such as maple syrup urine disease, citrullinemia, and propionic acidemia. Recent studies have shown that continuous hemofiltration therapies have more effective clearances than PD does. Similar observations were reported for the use of PD in drug poisoning. Peritoneal dialysis is still a valuable tool as a complementary measure in the treatment of hypothermia. Recently, prospective work in patients affected by end-stage congestive heart failure has shown that maintenance PD significantly lowers morbidity and mortality and substantially improves functional capabilities and quality of life in these otherwise terminally ill patients.",

Initially, we suspected that a portosystemic shunt had caused his hyperammonemia. However, his symptoms did not improve after balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration. He was subsequently found to have some peculiar eating habits, including a fondness for bean curd and peanuts, and an aversion to alcohol and sweets. Furthermore, marked citrullinemia (454.2 nmol/mL) was revealed, which led us to suspect adult-onset type II citrullinemia (CTLN2). DNA analysis of the patient and his mother, son, and daughter confirmed that he was homozygous for the c.852_855del mutation in the SLC25A13 gene, and his relatives were heterozygous for the c.852_855del mutation, which led to a definitive diagnosis. A low-carbohydrate diet and the administration of L-arginine ameliorated his symptoms. It is important to be aware that CTLN2 can occur in elderly patients. Thus, patients who exhibit symptoms of CTLN2 should be interviewed about their dietary habits and subjected to plasma amino acid analysis.In this report, we consider the metabolic disorders seen in citrin deficiency and the associated compensatory mechanisms in relation to the clinical features and treatment of CTLN2.",

Recently, we experienced an infantile NICCD who developed progressive liver failure, and required subsequent LT using a heterozygote living donor at eight months of age. Diagnosis of NICCD was established before transplantation, and donor evaluation included mutation in the SLC25A13 gene for exclusion of individuals with citrin deficiency citrullinemia. LDLT, from blood type identical mother using a left lateral segment graft, was performed without serious complication. Plasma amino acid concentration was normalized rapidly, and the patient was discharged 30 days after transplant. During one yr follow up, the recipient has been doing well without additional medication for NICCD. NICCD should be considered in the differential diagnosis as a cause of neonatal/infantile cholestatic disease.

Almost half of adult cases of ALF are due to acetaminophen toxicity, with 21% labeled indeterminate or other. We present a patient with a second episode of ALF, both episodes being initiated by catabolic stress. Elevated aminotransferases, jaundice, an elevated international normalized ratio, and confusion were typical of idiopathic ALF, and a low serum ceruloplasmin level initially led to a misdiagnosis of acute Wilson disease. Citrullinemia type I, a urea cycle defect caused by a deficiency of argininosuccinate synthetase, was diagnosed on the basis of plasma amino acids and was confirmed by molecular testing. Urea cycle defects are not generally considered causes of ALF in adults and are described rarely in children beyond the neonatal period. Our case illustrates the importance of screening patients with idiopathic ALF for a metabolic disorder. A prompt diagnosis and timely treatment enabled her to recover fully without the need for liver transplantation.",

While the short-term outcomes of this operation have been comparable with orthotopic LT, its long-term outcomes have sparsely been reported. We present one such case of Citrullinemia type I who underwent APOLT and developed recurrent PS. CASE REPORT: A 2-year-old male child with a diagnosis of Citrullinemia type I underwent APOLT with a left lateral segment from a split deceased donor liver, and his postoperative period was unremarkable. Ammonia-lowering agents were stopped 1 week following the operation and the child was discharged home on a normal diet. Four years following APOLT, the child presented with altered sensorium and seizures. A diagnosis of PS was made. Subsequent to an embolization of the native liver's right anterior portal vein his sensorium improved and he remained clinically stable on a normal diet. Six years following the APOLT, the child again presented with features of acute encephalopathy. Imaging was suggestive of PS. A portal vein embolization of the native portal vein was performed and the child's clinical condition improved. At 6 months' follow-up, the child remains well on a normal diet. CONCLUSIONS: While the early impediments in this technique may have been overcome, in the absence of any realistic clinical application gene therapy, the debate of long-term phenotypic metabolic correction for NCMLD by APOLT needs to be revisited.",

The end result is hyperammonemia which can cause life-threatening neurologic symptoms and global developmental delay. Previous case reports of the anesthetic management of patients with citrullinemia describe delayed recovery possibly related to elevated ammonia levels postoperatively or choice of intraoperative anesthetics which have included narcotics. In this case report, we present the anesthetic management of a 16-year-old adolescent girl with citrullinemia type I undergoing a vagus nerve stimulator revision. We used the alpha-2-adrenergic agonist, dexmedetomidine, as an adjunct to avoid narcotics to prevent delayed emergence. She was admitted for hydration the night before the procedure and had a baseline ammonia level of 33 mumol/L (reference, 9-33 mumol/L). Anesthetic maintenance consisted of 2% sevoflurane, dexmedetomidine 0.5 mug/kg per hour, and intravenous acetaminophen given toward the conclusion of the surgery. The patient awoke immediately at the end of the procedure and was extubated in the operating room. Postprocedure, her ammonia level was less than 9 mumol/L. She appeared to be free of pain, was tolerating gastric tube feeds postprocedure, and was discharged to home on the day of surgery. Effective management of ammonia levels in this patient using preoperative hydration and dexmedetomidine as an adjunct to general anesthesia may have helped to prevent delayed emergence. ",

METHODS: A longitudinal retrospective review was performed. Data were collected from medical records on presenting signs and symptoms, dietary management and clinical outcome. RESULTS: data were collected on 32 patients from 21 families. 50% were females (16/32). Median age at diagnosis was 4 y (5 days-35 y) with 12 patients diagnosed in the neonatal period with neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis (NICCD), eight later in childhood (FTTDCD) and 12 by family screening based on index cases from five families. No patient had adult-onset type II citrullinemia. The patient age at the time of data collection was a median of 11 y (1-44 y). 91% (29/32) of patients had normal physical and neurological development, 47% (15/32) experienced recurrent unexplained abdominal pain and 9% (3/32) episodes of hypoglycaemia. Siblings had different phenotypes (5 families had > 1 affected patient). Most patients preferred high protein foods, limiting sugar-containing foods. Only 41% (13/32) were prescribed a low CHO, high protein, high fat diet (restriction varied) and two used medium chain triglyceride (MCT) supplements. No patient was prescribed drug therapy. Twenty-five per cent (8/32) of patients were underweight and 41% (13/32) had height <-1 z-scores. CONCLUSIONS: patients presented with various phenotypes, symptoms and suboptimal growth. Symptoms and biochemical markers improved with age, but height remained low in some.

However, there is a paucity of systematic analysis on the effects of LTx on health-related outcome parameters as compared to individuals with comparable severity who are medically managed. METHODS: We investigated the effects of LTx and medical management on validated health-related outcome parameters including the metabolic disease course, linear growth, and neurocognitive outcomes. Individuals were stratified into \"severe\" and \"attenuated\" categories based on the genotype-specific and validated in vitro enzyme activity. RESULTS: LTx enabled metabolic stability by prevention of further HAE after transplantation, and was associated with a more favorable growth outcome as compared to individuals remaining under medical management. However, neurocognitive outcome in individuals with LTx did not differ from the medically managed counterparts as reflected by the frequency of motor abnormality and cognitive standard deviation score at last observation. CONCLUSION: Whereas LTx enabled metabolic stability without further need of protein restriction or nitrogen-scavenging therapy and was associated with a more favorable growth outcome, LTx - as currently performed - was not associated with improved neurocognitive outcomes as compared to long-term medical management in the investigated UCDs.",

                    "abstract": "Citrullinemia is a urea cycle disorder caused by deficiency of argininosuccinate synthetase. Late onset forms can remain undiscovered until a decompensation that can resemble encephalitis. Herein, we report a 14-year old patient with suspected encephalitis with fluctuating episodes of confusion. EEG mainly showed bilateral slowing with some spikes plus spike waves; and was interpreted as suspicious for encephalitis. Brain MRI was normal. Leukocytes in CSF were slightly elevated. Treatment for a CNS infectious disease was begun. Symptoms did not resolve and there were several episodes of confusion, so a repeat lumbar puncture was performed according to a standardized protocol including an amino acid profile. An elevation of citrulline in CSF was found, which ultimately led to the diagnosis of a late onset citrullinemia. The establishment of this diagnosis will protect the patient from the sequelae of unrecognized and thus untreated episodes of hyperammonemia. Thus, following a standardized lumbar puncture protocol can be essential to detect patients with otherwise unrecognized underlying metabolic disorders that are not suspected because of clinical symptoms. In addition, it is important to stress that an ammonia concentration should be determined in any patient with neurological signs like confusion.",

Despite advances in medical therapy, neurocognitive outcomes remain suboptimal. LT has emerged as a potential management option. A retrospective single-center review identified 7 children with a median age of 1.1 years (range, 0.6-5.8) at referral. Five children presented clinically, and 2 were treated prospectively from birth due to positive family history. All patients received standard medical and dietary therapy prior to LT. The indications for LT were frequent metabolic decompensations in 4, elective in 2, and ALF in 1. The median age at LT was 2.4 years (range, 1.3-6.5). Five patients received 6 left lateral segment grafts, one a live unrelated donor left lateral segment as an APOLT graft, and one a cadaveric whole liver graft as APOLT. One child required retransplantation due to hepatic artery thrombosis. Graft and patient survival were 86% and 100%, respectively. Median follow-up is 3.1 years (range, 0.1-4.1), and the median age at follow-up is 5.5 years (range, 4.0-9.8). There have been no metabolic decompensations in 6 children, while 1 patient (with APOLT) developed asymptomatic hyperammonemia with no clinical or histological signs of liver injury, requiring additional medical therapy. Our medium-term experience following LT in citrullinemia is favorable, demonstrating a positive transformation of the clinical phenotype.",

Elevated aminotransferases, jaundice, an elevated international normalized ratio, and confusion were typical of idiopathic ALF, and a low serum ceruloplasmin level initially led to a misdiagnosis of acute Wilson disease. Citrullinemia type I, a urea cycle defect caused by a deficiency of argininosuccinate synthetase, was diagnosed on the basis of plasma amino acids and was confirmed by molecular testing. Urea cycle defects are not generally considered causes of ALF in adults and are described rarely in children beyond the neonatal period.

CTLN1 patients suffer from impaired elimination of nitrogen, which leads to neurotoxic levels of circulating ammonia and urea cycle byproducts that may cause severe metabolic encephalopathy, death or irreversible brain damage. Standard of care (SOC) of CTLN1 consists of daily nitrogen-scavenger administration, but patients remain at risk of life-threatening decompensations. We evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of a recombinant adeno-associated viral vector carrying the ASS1 gene under the control of a liver-specific promoter (VTX-804). When administered to three-week-old CTLN1 mice, all the animals receiving VTX-804 in combination with SOC gained body weight normally, presented with a normalization of ammonia and reduction of citrulline levels in circulation, and 100% survived for 7 months. Similar to what has been observed in CTLN1 patients, CTLN1 mice showed several behavioral abnormalities such as anxiety, reduced welfare and impairment of innate behavior. Importantly, all clinical alterations were notably improved after treatment with VTX-804. This study demonstrates the potential of VTX-804 gene therapy for future clinical translation to CTLN1 patients.",

AIM: The objective of this research is to analyse the value of fasting and stimulated citrullinemias in the intestinal function evaluation. METHODS: A case-control study was undertaken, including 11 patients with short bowel syndrome, 13 patients submitted to malabsorptive bariatric surgery and 11 healthy controls. Plasma levels of amino acids were determined, before and after a stimulation test with oral Lglutamine, by ion exchange chromatography. RESULTS: Citrullinemia was inferior in short bowel patients (28,6 +- 11,3 versus 35,5 +- 11 in operated obese versus 32,2 +- 6,6 mumol/L in controls; n.s.) and lower than 25,5 mumol/L in 54,5% of them (versus 16,7%; p = 0,041; accuracy = 74%; odds ratio = 3, 95%CI 1,2-7,6). DeltaCitrullinemia80 (relative variation of citrullinemia at the 80th minute of test) was lower in short bowel patients; its diagnostic accuracy was similar to baseline citrullinemia and also not significant. DeltaCitrullinemia80 revealed a high predictive capacity of a short bowel inferior or equal to 50 cm (auR.O.C. = 82,3%; 95%CI 61,7-102,8; p = 0,038). CONCLUSIONS: In short bowel syndrome context, citrullinemia stimulation test with oral L-glutamine is feasible and it may improve the predictive capacity of severity. Further investigation is required to determine its clinical relevance and applicability.",

                    "abstract": "Citrin, encoded by SLC25A13, constitutes the malate-aspartate shuttle, the main NADH-shuttle in the liver. Citrin deficiency causes neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis (NICCD) and adult-onset type II citrullinemia (CTLN2). Citrin deficiency is predicted to impair hepatic glycolysis and de novo lipogenesis, resulting in hepatic energy deficit. Secondary decrease in hepatic argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS1) expression has been considered a cause of hyperammonemia in CTLN2. We previously reported that medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) supplement therapy with a low-carbohydrate formula was effective in CTLN2 to prevent a relapse of hyperammonemic encephalopathy. We present the therapy for six CTLN2 patients. All the patients' general condition steadily improved and five patients with hyperammonemic encephalopathy recovered from unconsciousness in a few days. Before the treatment, plasma glutamine levels did not increase over the normal range and rather decreased to lower than the normal range in some patients. The treatment promptly decreased the blood ammonia level, which was accompanied by a decrease in plasma citrulline levels and an increase in plasma glutamine levels. These findings indicated that hyperammonemia was not only caused by the impairment of ureagenesis at ASS1 step, but was also associated with an impairment of glutamine synthetase (GS) ammonia-detoxification system in the hepatocytes. There was no decrease in the GS expressing hepatocytes. MCT supplement with a low-carbohydrate formula can supply the energy and/or substrates for ASS1 and GS, and enhance ammonia detoxification in hepatocytes. Histological improvement in the hepatic steatosis and ASS1-expression was also observed in a patient after long-term treatment.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Liver transplantation (LTx) is an intervention when medical management is not sufficiently preventing individuals with urea cycle disorders (UCDs) from the occurrence of hyperammonemic events. Supplementation with L-citrulline/arginine is regularly performed prior to LTx to support ureagenesis and is often continued after the intervention. However, systematic studies assessing the impact of long-term L-citrulline/arginine supplementation in individuals who have undergone LTx is lacking to date. METHODS: Using longitudinal data collected systematically, a comparative analysis was carried out by studying the effects of long-term L-citrulline/arginine supplementation vs. no supplementation on health-related outcome parameters (i.e., anthropometric, neurological, and cognitive outcomes) in individuals with UCDs who have undergone LTx. Altogether, 52 individuals with male ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, citrullinemia type 1 and argininosuccinic aciduria and a pre-transplant \"severe\" disease course who have undergone LTx were investigated by using recently established and validated genotype-specific in vitro enzyme activities. RESULTS: Long-term supplementation of individuals with L-citrulline/arginine who have undergone LTx (n = 16) does neither appear to alter anthropometric nor neurocognitive endpoints when compared to their severity-adjusted counterparts that were not supplemented (n = 36) after LTx with mean observation periods between four to five years. Moreover, supplementation with L-citrulline/arginine was not associated with an increase of disease-specific plasma arithmetic mean values for the respective amino acids when compared to the non-supplemented control cohort. CONCLUSION: Although supplementation with L-citrulline/arginine is often continued after LTx, this pilot study does neither identify altered long-term anthropometric or neurocognitive health-related outcomes nor does it find an adequate biochemical response as reflected by the unaltered plasma arithmetic mean values for L-citrulline or L-arginine. Further prospective analyses in larger samples and even longer observation periods will provide more insight into the usefulness of long-term supplementation with L-citrulline/arginine for individuals with UCDs who have undergone LTx.",

However, citrulline is very rapidly metabolized. We therefore developed a sustained-release form of citrulline and evaluated its metabolic behavior in rats. METHODS: Male Sprague Dawley rats were divided into three groups: receiving \"empty microcapsule\" (control group), 1 g/kg/d immediate-release citrulline (IR citrulline group), or 1 g/kg/d sustained-release citrulline (SR citrulline group). Citrulline was given each day at 9 a.m. after blood samples for 9 d, and on day 10, blood samples were drawn every 4 h to study the decrease in plasma amino acid concentrations. RESULTS: SR citrulline led to a sustained increase in citrullinemia and argininemia compared to IR citrulline, and on day 6 argininemia was significantly (P < 0.01) higher with SR compared to IR citrulline. Moreover, argininemia was significantly higher in the SR citrulline group than in controls throughout the study and SR citrulline maintained high argininemia and citrullinemia, at least over 12 h. CONCLUSION: This experimental study provides a strong rationale for using this new formulation for atherosclerosis treatment.",

Elevated aminotransferases, jaundice, an elevated international normalized ratio, and confusion were typical of idiopathic ALF, and a low serum ceruloplasmin level initially led to a misdiagnosis of acute Wilson disease. Citrullinemia type I, a urea cycle defect caused by a deficiency of argininosuccinate synthetase, was diagnosed on the basis of plasma amino acids and was confirmed by molecular testing. Urea cycle defects are not generally considered causes of ALF in adults and are described rarely in children beyond the neonatal period.

Late onset forms can remain undiscovered until a decompensation that can resemble encephalitis. Herein, we report a 14-year old patient with suspected encephalitis with fluctuating episodes of confusion. EEG mainly showed bilateral slowing with some spikes plus spike waves; and was interpreted as suspicious for encephalitis. Brain MRI was normal. Leukocytes in CSF were slightly elevated. Treatment for a CNS infectious disease was begun. Symptoms did not resolve and there were several episodes of confusion, so a repeat lumbar puncture was performed according to a standardized protocol including an amino acid profile. An elevation of citrulline in CSF was found, which ultimately led to the diagnosis of a late onset citrullinemia. The establishment of this diagnosis will protect the patient from the sequelae of unrecognized and thus untreated episodes of hyperammonemia. Thus, following a standardized lumbar puncture protocol can be essential to detect patients with otherwise unrecognized underlying metabolic disorders that are not suspected because of clinical symptoms. In addition, it is important to stress that an ammonia concentration should be determined in any patient with neurological signs like confusion.",

Almost half of adult cases of ALF are due to acetaminophen toxicity, with 21% labeled indeterminate or other. We present a patient with a second episode of ALF, both episodes being initiated by catabolic stress. Elevated aminotransferases, jaundice, an elevated international normalized ratio, and confusion were typical of idiopathic ALF, and a low serum ceruloplasmin level initially led to a misdiagnosis of acute Wilson disease. Citrullinemia type I, a urea cycle defect caused by a deficiency of argininosuccinate synthetase, was diagnosed on the basis of plasma amino acids and was confirmed by molecular testing. Urea cycle defects are not generally considered causes of ALF in adults and are described rarely in children beyond the neonatal period. Our case illustrates the importance of screening patients with idiopathic ALF for a metabolic disorder. A prompt diagnosis and timely treatment enabled her to recover fully without the need for liver transplantation.",

Citrullinemia type II (CTLN-II) is an inherited disorder caused by germline mutations in SLC25A13, manifesting clinically in growth failure that can be alleviated by dietary restriction of carbohydrates. The association of citrin with glycolysis and NAD+/NADH ratio led us to hypothesize that it may play a role in carcinogenesis. Indeed, we find that citrin is upregulated in multiple cancer types and is essential for supplementing NAD+ for glycolysis and NADH for oxidative phosphorylation. Consequently, citrin deficiency associates with autophagy, whereas its overexpression in cancer cells increases energy production and cancer invasion. Furthermore, based on the human deleterious mutations in citrin, we found a potential inhibitor of citrin that restricts cancerous phenotypes in cells. Collectively, our findings suggest that targeting citrin may be of benefit for cancer therapy.",

                    "abstract": "Identification of the genes responsible for adult-onset type II citrullinemia (CTLN2) and citrin protein function have enhanced our understanding of citrin deficiency. Citrin deficiency is characterized by 1) neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis caused by citrin deficiency (NICCD); 2) adaptation/compensation stage with unique food preference from childhood to adulthood; and 3) CTLN2. The treatment of NICCD aims to prevent the progression of cholestasis, and it includes medium chain triglycerides (MCT) milk and lactose-free milk, in addition to medications (e.g., vitamin K2, lipid-soluble vitamins and ursodeoxycholic acid). Spontaneous remission around the age of one is common in NICCD, though prolonged cholestasis can lead to irreversible liver failure and may require liver transplantation. The adaptation/compensation stage (after one year of age) is characterized by the various signs and symptoms such as hypoglycemia, fatty liver, easy fatigability, weight loss, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Some poorly-controlled patients show failure to thrive and dyslipidemia caused by citrin deficiency (FTTDCD). Diet therapy is the key in the adaptation/compensation stage. Protein- and fat-rich diet with a protein: fat: carbohydrate ratio being 15-25%: 40-50%: 30-40% along with the appropriate energy intake is recommended. The use of MCT oil and sodium pyruvate is also effective. The toxicity of carbohydrate is well known in the progression to CTLN2 if the consumption is over a long term or intense. Alcohol can also trigger CTLN2. Continuous intravenous hyperalimentation with high glucose concentration needs to be avoided. Administration of Glyceol  (an osmotic agent containing glycerol and fructose) is contraindicated. Because the intense treatment such as liver transplantation may become necessary to cure CTLN2, the effective preventative treatment during the adaptation/compensation stage is very important. At present, there is no report of a case with patients reported having the onset of CTLN2 who are on the diet therapy and under the appropriate medical support during the adaptation/compensation stage.",

The end result is hyperammonemia which can cause life-threatening neurologic symptoms and global developmental delay. Previous case reports of the anesthetic management of patients with citrullinemia describe delayed recovery possibly related to elevated ammonia levels postoperatively or choice of intraoperative anesthetics which have included narcotics. In this case report, we present the anesthetic management of a 16-year-old adolescent girl with citrullinemia type I undergoing a vagus nerve stimulator revision. We used the alpha-2-adrenergic agonist, dexmedetomidine, as an adjunct to avoid narcotics to prevent delayed emergence. She was admitted for hydration the night before the procedure and had a baseline ammonia level of 33 mumol/L (reference, 9-33 mumol/L). Anesthetic maintenance consisted of 2% sevoflurane, dexmedetomidine 0.5 mug/kg per hour, and intravenous acetaminophen given toward the conclusion of the surgery. The patient awoke immediately at the end of the procedure and was extubated in the operating room. Postprocedure, her ammonia level was less than 9 mumol/L. She appeared to be free of pain, was tolerating gastric tube feeds postprocedure, and was discharged to home on the day of surgery. Effective management of ammonia levels in this patient using preoperative hydration and dexmedetomidine as an adjunct to general anesthesia may have helped to prevent delayed emergence. ",

Citrin deficiency is characterized by 1) neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis caused by citrin deficiency (NICCD); 2) adaptation/compensation stage with unique food preference from childhood to adulthood; and 3) CTLN2. The treatment of NICCD aims to prevent the progression of cholestasis, and it includes medium chain triglycerides (MCT) milk and lactose-free milk, in addition to medications (e.g., vitamin K2, lipid-soluble vitamins and ursodeoxycholic acid). Spontaneous remission around the age of one is common in NICCD, though prolonged cholestasis can lead to irreversible liver failure and may require liver transplantation. The adaptation/compensation stage (after one year of age) is characterized by the various signs and symptoms such as hypoglycemia, fatty liver, easy fatigability, weight loss, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Some poorly-controlled patients show failure to thrive and dyslipidemia caused by citrin deficiency (FTTDCD). Diet therapy is the key in the adaptation/compensation stage. Protein- and fat-rich diet with a protein: fat: carbohydrate ratio being 15-25%: 40-50%: 30-40% along with the appropriate energy intake is recommended. The use of MCT oil and sodium pyruvate is also effective. The toxicity of carbohydrate is well known in the progression to CTLN2 if the consumption is over a long term or intense. Alcohol can also trigger CTLN2. Continuous intravenous hyperalimentation with high glucose concentration needs to be avoided. Administration of Glyceol  (an osmotic agent containing glycerol and fructose) is contraindicated. Because the intense treatment such as liver transplantation may become necessary to cure CTLN2, the effective preventative treatment during the adaptation/compensation stage is very important. At present, there is no report of a case with patients reported having the onset of CTLN2 who are on the diet therapy and under the appropriate medical support during the adaptation/compensation stage.",

METHODS: A longitudinal retrospective review was performed. Data were collected from medical records on presenting signs and symptoms, dietary management and clinical outcome. RESULTS: data were collected on 32 patients from 21 families. 50% were females (16/32). Median age at diagnosis was 4 y (5 days-35 y) with 12 patients diagnosed in the neonatal period with neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis (NICCD), eight later in childhood (FTTDCD) and 12 by family screening based on index cases from five families. No patient had adult-onset type II citrullinemia. The patient age at the time of data collection was a median of 11 y (1-44 y). 91% (29/32) of patients had normal physical and neurological development, 47% (15/32) experienced recurrent unexplained abdominal pain and 9% (3/32) episodes of hypoglycaemia. Siblings had different phenotypes (5 families had > 1 affected patient). Most patients preferred high protein foods, limiting sugar-containing foods. Only 41% (13/32) were prescribed a low CHO, high protein, high fat diet (restriction varied) and two used medium chain triglyceride (MCT) supplements. No patient was prescribed drug therapy. Twenty-five per cent (8/32) of patients were underweight and 41% (13/32) had height <-1 z-scores. CONCLUSIONS: patients presented with various phenotypes, symptoms and suboptimal growth. Symptoms and biochemical markers improved with age, but height remained low in some. More research is necessary to assess the effectiveness of dietary approaches in improving clinical outcomes and symptoms in citrin deficiency.",

Here we report a 48-year-old Japanese man who showed abnormal nocturnal behavior. Laboratory data indicated raised plasma concentrations of ammonia and citrulline, and a definitive diagnosis of CTLN2 was made by DNA analysis. Hyperammonemia was not improved by oral intake of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), whereas venous infusion of BCAA was effective. Western blotting revealed heterozygotic expression of citrin protein in a liver biopsy specimen from the patient's brother. However, as symptomatic CTLN2 is very unusual in a heterozygotic carrier, we considered the brother suitable as a living-donor liver transplantation (LDLT) donor. The recipient's entire liver was removed, and replaced with the left liver graft. The plasma ammonia level remained low without infusion of BCAA after liver transplantation. From this case we conclude that venous infusion, rather than oral administration, of BCAA is useful for conservative treatment of CTLN2. However, liver transplantation is the only effective therapeutic option for CTLN2, and should be performed before irreversible encephalopathy occurs. Use of a graft from heterozygotic donors is permissible treatment for CTLN2.",

Although the MRI had shown no gross abnormality, the VBM revealed significantly smaller-than-normal regional volume in the left hippocampus of the patient as compared with 111 age-matched controls. 1H-MRS further indicated reduction of all metabolite concentrations in the left hippocampus compared with those in the right homolog region, with the single exception of elevated glutamate concentration. These results are similar to those of patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), although CTLN2-complicated mesial TLE has rarely been reported.

                    "abstract": "Citrin deficiency induces two clinical features; namely neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis caused by citrin deficiency (NICCD) and adult-onset type II citrullinemia. Hypercitrullinemia is the most characteristic feature, whereas there are non-citrullinemic individuals. Diagnosis of citrin deficiency is performed by genetic analysis, although the 12 known mutations in the alleles are not detected in about 15% of cases. Thus, we aimed to examine citrin protein in lymphocytes isolated from peripheral blood as an alternative diagnostic method. We examined 38 children having an episode of cholestatic liver dysfunction, 8 heterozygotes, and 11 healthy individuals. All subjects were evaluated for citrin protein by Western blotting and for the 12 known mutations by gene analysis. Citrin protein was detected in 15 of 38 children with cholestatic liver dysfunction. Fourteen of them were negative for 12 known mutations in both alleles, whereas one patient was found to have a known mutation in one allele. Citrin protein was absent in 23 of the 38 patients. Among these 23, gene analysis diagnosed citrin deficiency in 19, whereas 2 patients were later revealed to be NICCD with novel mutations. In the remaining 2 patients, who exhibit the clinical features of NICCD, a known mutation was detected in one allele but no mutation was identified in another allele. Citrin protein was also detected in the 8 heterozygotes and 11 healthy individuals. We disclosed that citrin was deficient in lymphocytes among patients with citrin deficiency. Analysis of citrin is useful to diagnose citrin deficiency even in patients without known mutations or hypercitrullinemia.",

Two years later, a younger sister was born without prenatal diagnosis. We monitored plasma ammonia and citrulline levels after birth, and again diagnosed her with CTLN1 on the basis of biochemical and DNA analyses. There have been few reports of the prospective treatment of citrullinemia; however, our experience indicates the need for the prospective management and the rapid reduction of ammonia levels to avoid neonatal hyperammonemic coma and subsequent sequelae.",

Although the MRI had shown no gross abnormality, the VBM revealed significantly smaller-than-normal regional volume in the left hippocampus of the patient as compared with 111 age-matched controls. 1H-MRS further indicated reduction of all metabolite concentrations in the left hippocampus compared with those in the right homolog region, with the single exception of elevated glutamate concentration. These results are similar to those of patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), although CTLN2-complicated mesial TLE has rarely been reported. In contrast to TLE, periictal asterixis and interictal slow activities on EEG support another possibility that the patient might have slight metabolic encephalopathy even after the liver transplantation.",

A 3-day-old female infant presented with status epilepticus and coma. Laboratory data showed hyperammonemia and marked lactic acidosis in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid; electroencephalography showed severely suppressed cerebral activity and focal paroxysmal volleys of slow and sharp waves (< 1Hz) over the left hemisphere. Real-time transcranial Doppler ultrasonography showed a brain edema and high peaked systolic and low diastolic flows in basal, anterior, and middle cerebral arteries; however, immediately after a blood exchange transfusion, systolic flows were lower and diastolic flows were higher. The resistance indices were significantly different (means: 0.58 vs. 0.37; p=0.01). The patient was placed on diet therapy. After six blood exchange transfusions and peritoneal dialysis, her neurologic examination results and serum ammonia and lactate values were normal. The authors found that electroencephalography and transcranial Doppler ultrasonography were useful for the diagnosis and follow-up treatment of neonatal citrullinemia. ",

Here we present one institution's 27 years of experience with LT in IEMs. Our objective is to assess the outcomes of IEM patients who have undergone LT, which we hypothesize to be generally successful for prevention of metabolic decompensation. A retrospective chart review was performed on patients with urea cycle defects, organic acidemias, and amino acidopathies who underwent LT at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Thirty-five patients with the following conditions have undergone LT: tyrosinemia (8), methylmalonic acidemia (7), maple syrup urine disease (6), citrullinemia (6), ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (4), propionic acidemia (2), and argininosuccinate lyase deficiency (2). Average age at transplantation was 3.6 years. Three patients are now deceased. One patient suffered a metabolic stroke posttransplant. No episodes of metabolic decompensation have been noted. Thirty-five patients received LT with generally favorable outcome. None sustained metabolic decompensation posttransplant. As has been reported previously, LT does not ameliorate pre-existing developmental differences or risk to other organ systems. Further research is needed to aid in standardization of care and follow-up, as most patients no longer follow with a geneticist.",

Laboratory tests showed hyperammonemia and hypercitrullinemia. The electro-encephalogram showed frontal dominant bilateral slow delta burst. He had a peculiar taste for nuts. But he didn't take nuts during the overseas travel for 3 days. The family history revealed that his younger brother died of a status epilepticus of unknown cause at the age of 29. These findings were compatible with hepatic encephalopathy due to adult-onset type II citrullinemia (CTLN2). Gene analysis provided a definite diagnosis of CTLN2. Diet and drug therapy have improved his condition. He is due to have liver transplantation which is the only established radical treatment for CTLN2 if his condition becomes worse. The present case shows that cessation of the habitual intake of nuts only for 3 days could lead to onset of CTLN2. ",

His diagnosis was confirmed as a homozygous mutation (Exon 15: c.1168G > A (p.G390R)) of ASS gene. Inspite of being on a protein-free diet and ammonia scavenging treatment; the patient developed recurrent episodes of encephalopathy and seizures; complicated with behavioral issues. The patient underwent living related liver-transplantation from his mother (heterozygous carrier of the same mutation). Peri-transplant management of ammonia and plasma amino acid levels is challenging and has been highlighted.

Patients with CTLN2 also display various neuropsychiatric symptoms. Many individuals with CTLN2 are fond of protein-rich and/or lipid-rich foods with an aversion to carbohydrate-rich foods. We herein report two cases of CTLN2 treated with living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) and provide a review of the pertinent literature. Case 1 was a 43-year-old man admitted to our hospital for repetitive episodes of consciousness disturbance. Case 2 was a 37-year-old man admitted to our hospital because of abnormal behavior associated with hyperammonemia. A definitive diagnosis of CTLN2 was accomplished by DNA analysis in both patients, who successfully underwent LDLT using liver segments from donor siblings with confirmed heterozygous gene expression. Case 2 also underwent conservative therapy with arginine and a high-fat, carbohydrate-restricted diet prior to LDLT. Postoperative recovery was uneventful and food was unrestricted in both patients. We also identified 77 cases of CTLN2 in the literature and reviewed them in terms of outcome of both liver transplantation and conservative therapy. The survival rate in patients treated by liver transplantation was 100%, whereas that in patients treated by conservative treatment showed improvement from 39.5% to 76.5% over the years. Liver transplantation is a practical treatment that fundamentally improves patient quality of life after transplantation. However, recent studies have suggested that arginine and sodium pyruvate administration combined with intensive nutritional support is also an effective therapy for CTLN2. Further development of conservative therapy may provide a safer, more affordable alternative to liver transplantation in the near future.",

Despite advances in medical therapy, neurocognitive outcomes remain suboptimal. LT has emerged as a potential management option. A retrospective single-center review identified 7 children with a median age of 1.1 years (range, 0.6-5.8) at referral. Five children presented clinically, and 2 were treated prospectively from birth due to positive family history. All patients received standard medical and dietary therapy prior to LT. The indications for LT were frequent metabolic decompensations in 4, elective in 2, and ALF in 1. The median age at LT was 2.4 years (range, 1.3-6.5). Five patients received 6 left lateral segment grafts, one a live unrelated donor left lateral segment as an APOLT graft, and one a cadaveric whole liver graft as APOLT. One child required retransplantation due to hepatic artery thrombosis. Graft and patient survival were 86% and 100%, respectively. Median follow-up is 3.1 years (range, 0.1-4.1), and the median age at follow-up is 5.5 years (range, 4.0-9.8). There have been no metabolic decompensations in 6 children, while 1 patient (with APOLT) developed asymptomatic hyperammonemia with no clinical or histological signs of liver injury, requiring additional medical therapy. Our medium-term experience following LT in citrullinemia is favorable, demonstrating a positive transformation of the clinical phenotype.",

A retrospective chart review was performed on patients with urea cycle defects, organic acidemias, and amino acidopathies who underwent LT at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Thirty-five patients with the following conditions have undergone LT: tyrosinemia (8), methylmalonic acidemia (7), maple syrup urine disease (6), citrullinemia (6), ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (4), propionic acidemia (2), and argininosuccinate lyase deficiency (2). Average age at transplantation was 3.6 years. Three patients are now deceased. One patient suffered a metabolic stroke posttransplant. No episodes of metabolic decompensation have been noted. Thirty-five patients received LT with generally favorable outcome. None sustained metabolic decompensation posttransplant. As has been reported previously, LT does not ameliorate pre-existing developmental differences or risk to other organ systems. Further research is needed to aid in standardization of care and follow-up, as most patients no longer follow with a geneticist.",

Recently, we experienced an infantile NICCD who developed progressive liver failure, and required subsequent LT using a heterozygote living donor at eight months of age. Diagnosis of NICCD was established before transplantation, and donor evaluation included mutation in the SLC25A13 gene for exclusion of individuals with citrin deficiency citrullinemia. LDLT, from blood type identical mother using a left lateral segment graft, was performed without serious complication. Plasma amino acid concentration was normalized rapidly, and the patient was discharged 30 days after transplant. During one yr follow up, the recipient has been doing well without additional medication for NICCD. NICCD should be considered in the differential diagnosis as a cause of neonatal/infantile cholestatic disease.

We describe the characteristics and outcomes of pediatric LT recipients with UCDs. We identified all pediatric (<18 years) LT candidates with UCDs in the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database (February 2002 to September 2020). Multivariable Cox and logistic regression were used to determine risk factors for graft loss and cognitive delay, respectively. Of 424 patients, 1.9% (8/424) experienced waitlist mortality and 95.0% underwent LT (403/424). The most frequently encountered UCDs in our cohort were ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (46.2%), citrullinemia (20.3%), and argininosuccinic aciduria (ASA; 12.9%). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year graft survival rates were 90.4%, 86.3%, and 85.2%, respectively. Multivariable analysis showed a decreased risk of graft loss with increasing weight at LT (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.96; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.94-0.99; P = 0.02), male sex (aHR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.28-0.85; P = 0.01), and ASA diagnosis (aHR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.09-0.98; P = 0.047), when adjusting for location (intensive care/hospital/home) and graft type (both P >= 0.65). In multivariable logistic regression, waitlist time (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.10; 95% CI, 1.02-1.17; P = 0.009) and male sex (aOR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.02-2.88; P = 0.04) were associated with increased odds of long-term cognitive delay. Waitlist duration is associated with a long-term risk of cognitive delay. Given excellent long-term outcomes, early LT evaluation should be considered in all children with UCDs to prevent progressive neurologic injury and optimize cognitive outcomes.",

                    "abstract": "Identification of the genes responsible for adult-onset type II citrullinemia (CTLN2) and citrin protein function have enhanced our understanding of citrin deficiency. Citrin deficiency is characterized by 1) neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis caused by citrin deficiency (NICCD); 2) adaptation/compensation stage with unique food preference from childhood to adulthood; and 3) CTLN2. The treatment of NICCD aims to prevent the progression of cholestasis, and it includes medium chain triglycerides (MCT) milk and lactose-free milk, in addition to medications (e.g., vitamin K2, lipid-soluble vitamins and ursodeoxycholic acid). Spontaneous remission around the age of one is common in NICCD, though prolonged cholestasis can lead to irreversible liver failure and may require liver transplantation. The adaptation/compensation stage (after one year of age) is characterized by the various signs and symptoms such as hypoglycemia, fatty liver, easy fatigability, weight loss, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Some poorly-controlled patients show failure to thrive and dyslipidemia caused by citrin deficiency (FTTDCD). Diet therapy is the key in the adaptation/compensation stage. Protein- and fat-rich diet with a protein: fat: carbohydrate ratio being 15-25%: 40-50%: 30-40% along with the appropriate energy intake is recommended. The use of MCT oil and sodium pyruvate is also effective. The toxicity of carbohydrate is well known in the progression to CTLN2 if the consumption is over a long term or intense. Alcohol can also trigger CTLN2. Continuous intravenous hyperalimentation with high glucose concentration needs to be avoided. Administration of Glyceol  (an osmotic agent containing glycerol and fructose) is contraindicated. Because the intense treatment such as liver transplantation may become necessary to cure CTLN2, the effective preventative treatment during the adaptation/compensation stage is very important. At present, there is no report of a case with patients reported having the onset of CTLN2 who are on the diet therapy and under the appropriate medical support during the adaptation/compensation stage.",

Although the MRI had shown no gross abnormality, the VBM revealed significantly smaller-than-normal regional volume in the left hippocampus of the patient as compared with 111 age-matched controls. 1H-MRS further indicated reduction of all metabolite concentrations in the left hippocampus compared with those in the right homolog region, with the single exception of elevated glutamate concentration.

His diagnosis was confirmed as a homozygous mutation (Exon 15: c.1168G > A (p.G390R)) of ASS gene. Inspite of being on a protein-free diet and ammonia scavenging treatment; the patient developed recurrent episodes of encephalopathy and seizures; complicated with behavioral issues. The patient underwent living related liver-transplantation from his mother (heterozygous carrier of the same mutation).

We describe the characteristics and outcomes of pediatric LT recipients with UCDs. We identified all pediatric (<18 years) LT candidates with UCDs in the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database (February 2002 to September 2020). Multivariable Cox and logistic regression were used to determine risk factors for graft loss and cognitive delay, respectively. Of 424 patients, 1.9% (8/424) experienced waitlist mortality and 95.0% underwent LT (403/424). The most frequently encountered UCDs in our cohort were ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (46.2%), citrullinemia (20.3%), and argininosuccinic aciduria (ASA; 12.9%). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year graft survival rates were 90.4%, 86.3%, and 85.2%, respectively. Multivariable analysis showed a decreased risk of graft loss with increasing weight at LT (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.96; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.94-0.99; P = 0.02), male sex (aHR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.28-0.85; P = 0.01), and ASA diagnosis (aHR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.09-0.98; P = 0.047), when adjusting for location (intensive care/hospital/home) and graft type (both P >= 0.65). In multivariable logistic regression, waitlist time (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.10; 95% CI, 1.02-1.17; P = 0.009) and male sex (aOR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.02-2.88; P = 0.04) were associated with increased odds of long-term cognitive delay. Waitlist duration is associated with a long-term risk of cognitive delay. Given excellent long-term outcomes, early LT evaluation should be considered in all children with UCDs to prevent progressive neurologic injury and optimize cognitive outcomes.",

The authors report a case of an 8-y boy who was diagnosed with Citrullinemia Type 1 at birth which was anticipated prenatally due to family history. His diagnosis was confirmed as a homozygous mutation (Exon 15: c.1168G > A (p.G390R)) of ASS gene. Inspite of being on a protein-free diet and ammonia scavenging treatment; the patient developed recurrent episodes of encephalopathy and seizures; complicated with behavioral issues. The patient underwent living related liver-transplantation from his mother (heterozygous carrier of the same mutation). Peri-transplant management of ammonia and plasma amino acid levels is challenging and has been highlighted. It is important to consider liver transplantation as it corrects the genetic deficiency of ASS resulting in the reversal of neuro-behavioral changes, as was seen in index patient.",

Patients with CTLN2 also display various neuropsychiatric symptoms. Many individuals with CTLN2 are fond of protein-rich and/or lipid-rich foods with an aversion to carbohydrate-rich foods. We herein report two cases of CTLN2 treated with living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) and provide a review of the pertinent literature. Case 1 was a 43-year-old man admitted to our hospital for repetitive episodes of consciousness disturbance. Case 2 was a 37-year-old man admitted to our hospital because of abnormal behavior associated with hyperammonemia. A definitive diagnosis of CTLN2 was accomplished by DNA analysis in both patients, who successfully underwent LDLT using liver segments from donor siblings with confirmed heterozygous gene expression. Case 2 also underwent conservative therapy with arginine and a high-fat, carbohydrate-restricted diet prior to LDLT. Postoperative recovery was uneventful and food was unrestricted in both patients. We also identified 77 cases of CTLN2 in the literature and reviewed them in terms of outcome of both liver transplantation and conservative therapy. The survival rate in patients treated by liver transplantation was 100%, whereas that in patients treated by conservative treatment showed improvement from 39.5% to 76.5% over the years. Liver transplantation is a practical treatment that fundamentally improves patient quality of life after transplantation. However, recent studies have suggested that arginine and sodium pyruvate administration combined with intensive nutritional support is also an effective therapy for CTLN2. Further development of conservative therapy may provide a safer, more affordable alternative to liver transplantation in the near future.",

Although the MRI had shown no gross abnormality, the VBM revealed significantly smaller-than-normal regional volume in the left hippocampus of the patient as compared with 111 age-matched controls. 1H-MRS further indicated reduction of all metabolite concentrations in the left hippocampus compared with those in the right homolog region, with the single exception of elevated glutamate concentration. These results are similar to those of patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), although CTLN2-complicated mesial TLE has rarely been reported. In contrast to TLE, periictal asterixis and interictal slow activities on EEG support another possibility that the patient might have slight metabolic encephalopathy even after the liver transplantation.",

FTTDCD and CTLN2 are known to complicate hypertriglyceridemia and chronic pancreatitis. Here we report, for the first time, the case of a patient with chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic pseudocyst with CTLN2 who was treated using endoscopic ultrasound-guided cyst drainage (EUS-CD). A 33-year-old woman with down syndrome presented to our hospital with complaints of fever, abdominal distention, and biliary vomiting for the previous 2 weeks. Owing to her difficulties in communication, although she had been taking a nutritionally balanced diet regardless of her preference, chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic stones had already been observed at the time of CTLN2 diagnosis at the age of 30 years. Three years later, a merged pancreatic pseudocyst was detected, and EUS-CD was successfully performed. A high-fat diet therapy for FTTDCD and CTLN2 may have caused the development of the pancreatic pseudocyst combined with chronic pancreatitis in this case. Pancreatic pseudocysts associated with FTTDCD or CTLN2 can be treated in a similar manner to those resulting from other causes.",

However, there is a paucity of systematic analysis on the effects of LTx on health-related outcome parameters as compared to individuals with comparable severity who are medically managed. METHODS: We investigated the effects of LTx and medical management on validated health-related outcome parameters including the metabolic disease course, linear growth, and neurocognitive outcomes. Individuals were stratified into \"severe\" and \"attenuated\" categories based on the genotype-specific and validated in vitro enzyme activity. RESULTS: LTx enabled metabolic stability by prevention of further HAE after transplantation, and was associated with a more favorable growth outcome as compared to individuals remaining under medical management. However, neurocognitive outcome in individuals with LTx did not differ from the medically managed counterparts as reflected by the frequency of motor abnormality and cognitive standard deviation score at last observation. CONCLUSION: Whereas LTx enabled metabolic stability without further need of protein restriction or nitrogen-scavenging therapy and was associated with a more favorable growth outcome, LTx - as currently performed - was not associated with improved neurocognitive outcomes as compared to long-term medical management in the investigated UCDs.",
