input_text: Delayed onset adenosine deaminase deficiency associated with acute disseminated
  encephalomyelitis.Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is a monophasic, immune-mediated
  demyelinating disorder that can appear after either immunizations or, more often,
  infections. Magnetic resonance imaging of patients shows inflammatory lesions in
  the brain and spinal cord. An immune-mediated mechanism may play a role in this
  disease, although its precise pathogenesis remains unclear. In this study, a 2-year-old
  boy presented with ADEM, and he showed improvement on treatment with high-dose intravenous
  corticosteroids. At the age of 3 years, the presence of recurrent bronchitis, bronchiectasia,
  and lymphopenia suggested that the patient was suffering from combined immunodeficiency.
  The patient was finally diagnosed with delayed onset adenosine deaminase deficiency.
  Delayed onset adenosine deaminase deficiency is frequently associated with autoimmune
  diseases, including thyroiditis and cytopenia, both of which were observed in the
  patient. The ADEM in this patient may be a presentation of delayed onset adenosine
  deaminase deficiency.
