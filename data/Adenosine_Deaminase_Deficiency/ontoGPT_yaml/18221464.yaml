input_text: 'Severe combined immunodeficiency: a national surveillance study.National
  immunodeficiency registers in several countries have reported prevalence but not
  incidence rates for severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). The objective of this
  study was to document the incidence and type of SCID in Australia, the age and clinical
  features at presentation and short-term management. The Australian Paediatric Surveillance
  Unit conducts active, monthly, national surveillance of rare disorders with reporting
  by child-health specialists. Between May 1995 and December 2001, clinicians provided
  clinical and laboratory data on children newly diagnosed with SCID. Thirty-three
  incident cases of SCID were identified [incidence 1.8/10(5) live births per annum;
  95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-2.5]. Twenty-six children had classical SCID (1.45/10(5)
  live births; 95% CI, 0.9-2.0) and 20 (77%) of these were boys. Classical SCID was
  X-linked in 13 children, autosomal recessive (AR), not further classified in four,
  and attributed to adenosine deaminase deficiency (ADA) in four, interleukin-7 receptor
  alpha chain deficiency in one, Ommen syndrome in two, and Di George syndrome in
  two. Twenty-one (81%) received bone marrow/stem cell transplantation, three of whom
  died between 1 and 4 months after transplantation (two ADA deficient, one AR). Seven
  children had atypical SCID, five of whom died within 1-4 yr of diagnosis. Most children
  with SCID presented with failure to thrive and recurrent infections and there was
  no significant delay between presentation and diagnosis. The reported national incidence
  of classical SCID in Australia (1.45/10(5) or approximately 4 cases per year or
  1/69,000 live births) is consistent with the rate (1.4/10(5)) previously reported
  in Victoria. Diagnosis is rarely delayed, and transplantation is associated with
  good short-term survival.'
