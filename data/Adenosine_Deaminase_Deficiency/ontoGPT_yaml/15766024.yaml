input_text: '[Treatment of primary immune defects].Management of immunodeficient patients
  includes monitoring of growth, diet, personal hygiene and life habits, including
  environmental factors. Major therapeutic stays are prevention, early detection and
  the decisive treatment of infections. Attenuated live vaccines, non-irradiated blood
  products and blood containing CMV antibodies should not be applied. In the case
  of antibody defects immunoglobulin substitution is a specific form of treatment.
  Enzyme replacement is a causal approach to an adenosine deaminase defect. For numerous
  primary immune defects, bone marrow transplantation represents the best causal therapeutic
  measure. In the absence of a bone marrow donor, alternative gene therapy is available
  for the management of severe combined immunodeficiency on the X-chromosome (X-SCID),
  and adenosine deaminase deficiency (ADA deficiency).'
