input_text: Late-onset adenosine deaminase deficiency presenting with Heck's disease.Focal
  epithelial hyperplasia, also known as Heck's disease, is a rare but distinctive
  entity of viral etiology with characteristic clinical and histopathological features.
  It is a benign, asymptomatic disease of the oral mucosa caused by human papilloma
  viruses (HPV). Previous studies postulated an association between these lesions
  and immunodeficiency. Genetic deficiency of adenosine deaminase (ADA) results in
  varying degrees of immunodeficiency, including neonatal onset severe combined immunodeficiency
  (ADA-SCID), and milder, later onset immunodeficiency. We report a 12-year-old girl
  with the late onset-ADA deficiency presenting with Heck's disease. Our case report
  should draw attention to the possibility of immunodeficiency in patients with HPV-induced
  focal epithelial hyperplasia.
