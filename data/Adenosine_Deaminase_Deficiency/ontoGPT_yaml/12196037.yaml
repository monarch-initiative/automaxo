input_text: Gene therapy in infants with severe combined immunodeficiency.Severe combined
  immunodeficiencies (SCID) are rare disorders that represent paediatric medical emergencies,
  as the outcome for affected patients can easily be fatal unless proper treatment
  is performed. The only curative treatment for SCID is reconstitution of the patient's
  immunity. For more than 30 years, allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) has
  been extremely successful for SCID. However, BMT often results in only incomplete
  restoration of B cell function in treated patients, especially when haploidentical
  donors are used. In addition, BMT can be associated with severe complications such
  as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Alternative forms of therapy for SCID are therefore
  desirable. Genetic correction of peripheral T lymphocytes and/or haematopoietic
  stem cells (HSCs) by retrovirally mediated gene transfer has been attempted for
  patients with SCID due to adenosine deaminase deficiency, the first genetic disease
  targeted in clinical gene therapy trials with very limited success, overall. After
  these pioneer trials, recent progress has led to significant improvement of gene
  transfer techniques and better understanding of HSC biology which has culminated
  in the recent success of a gene therapy trial for patients affected with X-linked
  SCID (X-SCID). In this trial, patients with X-SCID received autologous bone marrow
  stem/progenitor cells which had been retrovirally transduced with a therapeutic
  gene. Based on the current follow-up, the overall efficacy of this gene therapy
  procedure is to be considered similar to or even better than that achievable by
  allogeneic BMT, because patients were not exposed to the risks of GVHD. Although
  these exciting results have clearly demonstrated that gene therapy is a feasible
  therapeutic option for X-SCID, they have also raised important questions regarding
  the long-term outcome of this experimental procedure and the possibility of translating
  this success into applications for other forms of SCID.
