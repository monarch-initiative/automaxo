input_text: 'Morbidity in an adenosine deaminase-deficient patient during 27 years
  of enzyme replacement therapy.INTRODUCTION: Adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency
  causes severe immunodeficiency that is lethal in infancy. Enzyme replacement therapy
  (ERT) can improve the metabolic, immune and non-immune abnormalities in patients
  prior to transplantation, however, its benefits over extended periods are not well
  characterized. We describe a 28-year-old female who received ERT for 27 years. She
  suffered from EBV negative B cell lymphoma of the hip at 14 years of age and Guillian-Barre
  Syndrome 2 years later. At 22 years of age, she experienced a gastrointestinal infection
  with Mycobacterium genavense. At 26 years of age, lymphoma reoccurred with multiple
  liver lesions followed by Mycobacterium genavense infection with dissemination to
  the brain. Throughout this period, ADA activity in the plasma was within the therapeutic
  range. Repeated evaluations demonstrated very low lymphocyte counts and impaired
  T cell function. CONCLUSIONS: ERT might be insufficient to maintain normal immunity
  over extended periods in some ADA-deficient patients.'
