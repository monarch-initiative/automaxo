input_text: 'Characteristic scapular and rib changes on chest radiographs of children
  with ADA-deficiency SCIDS in the first year of life.BACKGROUND: We describe radiographic
  changes in the ribs and scapulae seen in the first 6 months of life in children
  with ADA (adenosine deaminase) deficiency severe combined immundeficiency syndrome
  (SCIDS). We suggest that these changes are reversible with appropriate enzyme replacement
  therapy. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to describe characteristic rib
  and scapular radiographic changes in infants with ADA-deficiency SCIDS. MATERIALS
  AND METHODS: This was a retrospective review of chest radiographs of nine children
  with ADA-deficiency SCIDS performed in the first year of life by two experienced
  pediatric radiologists. A control cohort of unaffected children was used for comparison.
  RESULTS: All children with ADA-deficiency SCIDS manifested unusual scapular spurring
  and anterior rib cupping. None of the control children manifested these changes.
  CONCLUSION: Characteristic and reversible scapular and rib changes in the correct
  clinical setting should suggest an early diagnosis of ADA deficiency, prompting
  appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic measures.'
