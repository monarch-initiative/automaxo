input_text: 'Diagnosis, Treatment and Long-Term Follow Up of Patients with ADA Deficiency:
  a Single-Center Experience.PURPOSE: We carried out a retrospective analysis of 27
  patients with Adenosine Deaminase (ADA) deficiency diagnosed in a single center
  from 1997 to the 2013, for evaluating whether data regarding types of disease-inducing
  mutations, biochemical and immunological features as well as clinical outcomes of
  patients treated with enzyme replacement or transplantation, were comparable to
  those obtained in multicenter studies. METHODS: The ADA deficiency diagnosis was
  performed with biochemical, immunological and molecular techniques. Ten patients
  treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and three in treatment with
  enzyme replacement were followed up in our center. RESULTS: Twenty-four different
  mutations were identified and five were not previously reported. Identical mutations
  were found among patients from the same Romani ethnic group or from the same geographical
  region. A more rapid recovery was observed in enzyme replacement treated patients
  in comparison with those transplanted that, however, showed a continuous and long-lasting
  improvement both in terms of immune and metabolic recovery. CONCLUSION: The data
  obtained in our single center are comparable with those that have been reported
  in multicenter surveys.'
