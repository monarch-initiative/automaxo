input_text: Role of reduced intensity conditioning in T-cell and B-cell immune reconstitution
  after HLA-identical bone marrow transplantation in ADA-SCID.The treatment of choice
  for severe combined immunodeficiency is bone marrow transplantation from an HLA-identical
  donor sibling without conditioning. However, this may result in low donor stem cell
  chimerism, leading to reduced long-term immune reconstitution. We compared engraftment,
  metabolic, and T-cell and B-cell immune reconstitution of HLA-identical sibling
  bone marrow transplantation performed in 2 severe combined immunodeficiency infants
  with adenosine deaminase deficiency from the same family treated with or without
  a reduced intensity conditioning regimen (busulfan/fludarabine). Only the patient
  who received conditioning showed a stable mixed chimerism in all lineages, including
  bone marrow myeloid and B cells. The use of conditioning resulted in higher thymus-derived
  naive T cells and T-cell receptor excision circles, normalization of the T-cell
  repertoire, and faster and complete B-cell and metabolic reconstitution. These results
  suggest the utility of exploring the use of reduced intensity conditioning in bone
  marrow transplantation from HLA-identical donor in severe combined immunodeficiency
  to improve long-term immune reconstitution.
