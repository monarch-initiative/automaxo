input_text: The use of enzyme therapy to regulate the metabolic and phenotypic consequences
  of adenosine deaminase deficiency in mice. Differential impact on pulmonary and
  immunologic abnormalities.Adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency results in a combined
  immunodeficiency brought about by the immunotoxic properties of elevated ADA substrates.
  Additional non-lymphoid abnormalities are associated with ADA deficiency, however,
  little is known about how these relate to the metabolic consequences of ADA deficiency.
  ADA-deficient mice develop a combined immunodeficiency as well as severe pulmonary
  insufficiency. ADA enzyme therapy was used to examine the relative impact of ADA
  substrate elevations on these phenotypes. A "low-dose" enzyme therapy protocol prevented
  the pulmonary phenotype seen in ADA-deficient mice, but did little to improve their
  immune status. This treatment protocol reduced metabolic disturbances in the circulation
  and lung, but not in the thymus and spleen. A "high-dose" enzyme therapy protocol
  resulted in decreased metabolic disturbances in the thymus and spleen and was associated
  with improvement in immune status. These findings suggest that the pulmonary and
  immune phenotypes are separable and are related to the severity of metabolic disturbances
  in these tissues. This model will be useful in examining the efficacy of ADA enzyme
  therapy and studying the mechanisms underlying the immunodeficiency and pulmonary
  phenotypes associated with ADA deficiency.
