input_text: Hyperbilirubinemia and rapid fatal hepatic failure in severe combined
  immunodeficiency caused by adenosine deaminase deficiency (ADA-SCID).Adenosin deaminase
  (ADA) deficiency is the cause for Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID) in about
  15% of patients with SCID, often presenting as T (-)B (-)NK (-)SCID. Treatment options
  for ADA-SCID are enzyme replacement, bone marrow transplantation or gene therapy.
  We here describe the first patient with ADA-SCID and fatal hepatic failure despite
  bone marrow transplantation from a 10/10 HLA identical related donor. As patients
  with ADA-SCID may be at yet underestimated increased risk for rapid hepatic failure
  we speculate whether hepatitis in ADA-SCID should lead to the immediate treatment
  with enzyme replacement by pegylated ADA.
