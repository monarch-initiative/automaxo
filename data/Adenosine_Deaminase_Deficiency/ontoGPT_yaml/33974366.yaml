input_text: 'Autologous Ex Vivo Lentiviral Gene Therapy for Adenosine Deaminase Deficiency.BACKGROUND:
  Severe combined immunodeficiency due to adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency (ADA-SCID)
  is a rare and life-threatening primary immunodeficiency. METHODS: We treated 50
  patients with ADA-SCID (30 in the United States and 20 in the United Kingdom) with
  an investigational gene therapy composed of autologous CD34+ hematopoietic stem
  and progenitor cells (HSPCs) transduced ex vivo with a self-inactivating lentiviral
  vector encoding human ADA. Data from the two U.S. studies (in which fresh and cryopreserved
  formulations were used) at 24 months of follow-up were analyzed alongside data from
  the U.K. study (in which a fresh formulation was used) at 36 months of follow-up.
  RESULTS: Overall survival was 100% in all studies up to 24 and 36 months. Event-free
  survival (in the absence of reinitiation of enzyme-replacement therapy or rescue
  allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation) was 97% (U.S. studies) and 100%
  (U.K. study) at 12 months; 97% and 95%, respectively, at 24 months; and 95% (U.K.
  study) at 36 months. Engraftment of genetically modified HSPCs persisted in 29 of
  30 patients in the U.S. studies and in 19 of 20 patients in the U.K. study. Patients
  had sustained metabolic detoxification and normalization of ADA activity levels.
  Immune reconstitution was robust, with 90% of the patients in the U.S. studies and
  100% of those in the U.K. study discontinuing immunoglobulin-replacement therapy
  by 24 months and 36 months, respectively. No evidence of monoclonal expansion, leukoproliferative
  complications, or emergence of replication-competent lentivirus was noted, and no
  events of autoimmunity or graft-versus-host disease occurred. Most adverse events
  were of low grade. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of ADA-SCID with ex vivo lentiviral HSPC
  gene therapy resulted in high overall and event-free survival with sustained ADA
  expression, metabolic correction, and functional immune reconstitution. (Funded
