input_text: 'Gene therapy for severe combined immunodeficiency caused by adenosine
  deaminase deficiency: improved retroviral vectors for clinical trials.Severe combined
  immunodeficiency (SCID) caused by adenosine deaminase deficiency (ADA-) is the first
  genetic disorder to be treated with gene therapy. Since 1990 when the first trial
  started for 2 patients with ADA- SCID, five clinical trials enrolling 11 patients
  have been conducted with different clinical approaches and the results obtained
  from these trials have recently been reported. According to these reports, T cell-directed
  gene transfer was useful in the treatment of ADA- SCID whereas the retroviral-mediated
  gene transfer to hematopoietic stem cells was insufficient for achievement of clinical
  benefits. This chapter reviews several crucial problems inherent in the current
  retroviral technology based on the clinical data observed in these pioneering ADA
  gene therapy trials and presents our new retroviral vector system for the next stem
  cell gene therapy.'
