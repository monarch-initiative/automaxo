input_text: Gene therapy for adenosine deaminase deficiency.The clinical gene therapy
  trials for adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency have defined both the potential
  benefits and the present limitations of gene therapy with hematopoietic stem cells
  (HSC). Current clinical results indicate that (a) both umbilical cord blood and
  neonatal bone marrow HSC can be transduced with murine retroviral-based vectors,
  (b) the transduced HSC can engraft in nonmyeloablated patients, (c) the frequency
  of HSC transduction/engraftment is low (1/10,000), (d) an in vivo selective advantage
  can exist for transduced T lymphoid progeny, and (e) the transduced ADA gene is
  not expressed in nondividing T lymphocytes. Improving the clinical results of gene
  therapy for ADA deficiency and other genetic diseases involving HSC will require
  (a) developing new vectors that express the transduced gene in nondividing cells
  and (b) increasing the frequency of stable HSC transduction.
