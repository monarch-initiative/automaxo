input_text: Updated Management Guidelines for Adenosine Deaminase Deficiency.Inherited
  defects in the adenosine deaminase (ADA) gene typically cause severe combined immunodeficiency.
  In addition to infections, ADA-deficient patients can present with neurodevelopmental,
  behavioral, hearing, skeletal, lung, heart, skin, kidney, urogenital, and liver
  abnormalities. Some patients also suffer from autoimmunity and malignancies. In
  recent years, there have been remarkable advances in the management of ADA deficiency.
  Most ADA-deficient patients can be identified by newborn screening for severe combined
  immunodeficiency, which facilitates early diagnosis and treatment of asymptomatic
  infants. Most patients benefit from enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Allogeneic
  hematopoietic cell transplantation from an HLA-matched sibling donor or HLA-matched
  family member donor with no conditioning is currently the preferable treatment.
  When matched sibling donor or matched family member donor is not available, autologous
  ADA gene therapy with nonmyeloablative conditioning and ERT withdrawal, which is
  reported in recent studies to result in 100% overall survival and 90% to 95% engraftment,
  should be pursued. If gene therapy is not immediately available, ERT can be continued
  for a few years, although its excessive cost might be prohibitive. The recent improved
  outcome of hematopoietic cell transplantation using HLA-mismatched family-related
  donors or HLA-matched unrelated donors, after reduced-intensity conditioning, suggests
  that such procedures might also be considered rather than continuing ERT for prolonged
  periods. Long-term follow-up will further assist in determining the optimal treatment
  approach for ADA-deficient patients.
