input_text: Bone marrow transplantation and alternatives for adenosine deaminase deficiency.Adenosine
  deaminase (ADA)-deficient severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) comprises approximately
  10% to 15% of all cases of SCID. The clinical effects of ADA deficiency are manifest
  most dramatically in the immune system, where it leads to severe lymphopenia. Although
  hematopoietic stem cell transplantation remains the mainstay of treatment for ADA-deficient
  SCID, 2 other treatment options are available, namely enzyme replacement therapy
  with PEG-ADA and autologous hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy. In this article
  the author reviews the available data on treatment by these different options, and
  offers an overview on when each of the different treatment options should be used.
