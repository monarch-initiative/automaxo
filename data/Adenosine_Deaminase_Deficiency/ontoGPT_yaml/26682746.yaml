input_text: Impulse oscillometry identifies peripheral airway dysfunction in children
  with adenosine deaminase deficiency.Adenosine deaminase-deficient severe combined
  immunodeficiency (ADA-SCID) is characterized by impaired T-, B- and NK-cell function.
  Affected children, in addition to early onset of infections, manifest non-immunologic
  symptoms including pulmonary dysfunction likely attributable to elevated systemic
  adenosine levels. Lung disease assessment has primarily employed repetitive radiography
  and effort-dependent functional studies. Through impulse oscillometry (IOS), which
  is effort-independent, we prospectively obtained objective measures of lung dysfunction
  in 10 children with ADA-SCID. These results support the use of IOS in the identification
  and monitoring of lung function abnormalities in children with primary immunodeficiencies.
