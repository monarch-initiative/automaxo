input_text: Gene therapy for adenosine deaminase deficiency.In the last decade, gene
  therapy for adenosine deaminase deficiency has been developed as a successful alternative
  strategy to allogeneic bone marrow transplant and enzyme replacement therapy. Infusion
  of autologous hematopoietic stem cells, corrected ex vivo by retroviral vectors
  and combined to low-intensity conditioning regimen, has resulted in immunologic
  improvement, metabolic correction, and long-term clinical benefits. These findings
  have opened the way to applications of gene therapy in other primary immune deficiencies
  using novel vector technology.
