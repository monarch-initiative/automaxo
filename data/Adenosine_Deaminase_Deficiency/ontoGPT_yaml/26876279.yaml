input_text: 'Cost-Effectiveness/Cost-Benefit Analysis of Newborn Screening for Severe
  Combined Immune Deficiency in Washington State.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the expected
  cost-effectiveness and net benefit of the recent implementation of newborn screening
  (NBS) for severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) in Washington State. STUDY DESIGN:
  We constructed a decision analysis model to estimate the costs and benefits of NBS
  in an annual birth cohort of 86 600 infants based on projections of avoided infant
  deaths. Point estimates and ranges for input variables, including the birth prevalence
  of SCID, proportion detected asymptomatically without screening through family history,
  screening test characteristics, survival rates, and costs of screening, diagnosis,
  and treatment were derived from published estimates, expert opinion, and the Washington
  NBS program. We estimated treatment costs stratified by age of identification and
  SCID type (with or without adenosine deaminase deficiency). Economic benefit was
  estimated using values of $4.2 and $9.0 million per death averted. We performed
  sensitivity analyses to evaluate the influence of key variables on the incremental
  cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of net direct cost per life-year saved. RESULTS:
  Our model predicts an additional 1.19 newborn infants with SCID detected preclinically
  through screening, in addition to those who would have been detected early through
  family history, and 0.40 deaths averted annually. Our base-case model suggests an
  ICER of $35 311 per life-year saved, and a benefit-cost ratio of either 5.31 or
  2.71. Sensitivity analyses found ICER values <$100 000 and positive net benefit
  for plausible assumptions on all variables. CONCLUSIONS: Our model suggests that
  NBS for SCID in Washington is likely to be cost-effective and to show positive net
  economic benefit.'
