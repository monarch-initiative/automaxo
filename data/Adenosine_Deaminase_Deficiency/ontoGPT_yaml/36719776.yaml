input_text: Transamniotic Fetal Administration of Genetically Modified Hematopoietic
  Stem Cells Carrying a Human Transgene in a Syngeneic Rat Model.Hematopoietic stem
  cell (HSC)-based gene therapy has already reached clinical reality in a few applications.
  Fetal administration of genetically modified HSCs has only been feasible to date
  through invasive and morbid methods. It has been recently shown that native donor
  HSCs can reach the fetal circulation and bone marrow after simple delivery into
  the amniotic fluid, at least in a syngeneic healthy model. We sought to determine
  whether the transamniotic route could also be a practical alternative for the fetal
  administration of genetically modified HSCs in a comparable model. Pregnant Lewis
  rat dams underwent volume-matched intra-amniotic injections in all their fetuses
  (n = 47) on gestational day 17 (E17; term = E21-22) of donor HSCs genetically modified
  using a custom lentiviral vector designed to constitutively express both a firefly
  luciferase reporter gene and a human adenosine deaminase (ADA) transgene. Donor
  HSCs consisted of syngeneic cells isolated from the amniotic fluid and phenotyped
  by flow cytometry. Fetuses were euthanized at term, when seven select sites relevant
  to HSC-based therapies were screened for either luciferase activity by luminometry
  or for the presence of human ADA mRNA by digital droplet polymerase chain reaction
  (ddPCR). Among survivors (30/47; 64%), positive luminescence and positive human
  ADA expression were detected in the bone marrow (respectively, 33% and 76%), liver
  (respectively, 11% and 81%), spleen (respectively, 11% and 67%), thymus (respectively,
  33% and 67%), lungs (respectively, 44% and 86%), and brain (respectively, 22% and
  90%). Nucleated peripheral blood cells were analyzed only by ddPCR, showing positive
  human ADA expression at 54%. We conclude that genetically modified HSCs can reach
  the fetal circulation and fetal bone marrow after simple intra-amniotic administration
  in a syngeneic rat model. Gene therapy by transamniotic HSC delivery may become
  a practicable, minimally invasive strategy for the prenatal treatment of select
  hemoglobinopathies, immunodeficiencies, and inherited metabolic disorders.
