input_text: 'Long-term and real-world safety and efficacy of retroviral gene therapy
  for adenosine deaminase deficiency.Adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency leads to
  severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). Previous clinical trials showed that autologous
  CD34+ cell gene therapy (GT) following busulfan reduced-intensity conditioning is
  a promising therapeutic approach for ADA-SCID, but long-term data are warranted.
  Here we report an analysis on long-term safety and efficacy data of 43 patients
  with ADA-SCID who received retroviral ex vivo bone marrow-derived hematopoietic
  stem cell GT. Twenty-two individuals (median follow-up 15.4 years) were treated
  in the context of clinical development or named patient program. Nineteen patients
  were treated post-marketing authorization (median follow-up 3.2 years), and two
  additional patients received mobilized peripheral blood CD34+ cell GT. At data cutoff,
  all 43 patients were alive, with a median follow-up of 5.0 years (interquartile
  range 2.4-15.4) and 2 years intervention-free survival (no need for long-term enzyme
  replacement therapy or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation) of 88%
  (95% confidence interval 78.7-98.4%). Most adverse events/reactions were related
  to disease background, busulfan conditioning or immune reconstitution; the safety
  profile of the real world experience was in line with premarketing cohort. One patient
  from the named patient program developed a T cell leukemia related to treatment
  4.7 years after GT and is currently in remission. Long-term persistence of multilineage
  gene-corrected cells, metabolic detoxification, immune reconstitution and decreased
  infection rates were observed. Estimated mixed-effects models showed that higher
  dose of CD34+ cells infused and younger age at GT affected positively the plateau
  of CD3+ transduced cells, lymphocytes and CD4+ CD45RA+ naive T cells, whereas the
  cell dose positively influenced the final plateau of CD15+ transduced cells. These
  long-term data suggest that the risk-benefit of GT in ADA remains favorable and
  warrant for continuing long-term safety monitoring. Clinical trial registration:
  NCT00598481 , NCT03478670 .'
