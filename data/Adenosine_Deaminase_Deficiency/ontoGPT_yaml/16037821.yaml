input_text: 'Hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy with drug resistance genes: an update.Transfer
  of drug resistance genes into hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) has promise for the
  treatment of a variety of inherited, that is, X-linked severe combined immune deficiency,
  adenosine deaminase deficiency, thalassemia, and acquired disorders, that is, breast
  cancer, lymphomas, brain tumors, and testicular cancer. Drug resistance genes are
  transferred into HSCs either for providing myeloprotection against chemotherapy-induced
  myelosuppression or for selecting HSCs that are concomitantly transduced with another
  gene for correction of an inherited disorder. In this review, we describe ongoing
  experimental approaches, observations from clinical trials, and safety concerns
  related to the drug resistance gene transfer.'
