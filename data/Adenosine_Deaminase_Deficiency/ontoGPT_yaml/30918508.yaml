input_text: 'Early Enzyme Replacement Therapy Improves Hearing and Immune Defects
  in Adenosine Deaminase Deficient-Mice.Background: Inherited defects in adenosine
  deaminase (ADA) cause severe immune deficiency, which can be corrected by ADA enzyme
  replacement therapy (ERT). Additionally, ADA-deficient patients suffer from hearing
  impairment. We hypothesized that ADA-deficient (-/-) mice also exhibit hearing abnormalities
  and that ERT from an early age will improve the hearing and immune defects in these
  mice. Methods: Auditory brainstem evoked responses, organ weights, thymocytes numbers,
  and subpopulations, lymphocytes in peripheral blood as well as T lymphocytes in
  spleen were analyzed in ADA-/- and ADA-proficient littermate post-partum (pp). The
  cochlea was visualized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The effects of polyethylene
  glycol conjugated ADA (PEG-ADA) ERT or 40% oxygen initiated at 7 days pp on the
  hearing and immune abnormalities were assessed. Results: Markedly abnormal hearing
  thresholds responses were found in ADA-/- mice at low and medium tone frequencies.
  SEM demonstrated extensive damage to the cochlear hair cells of ADA-/- mice, which
  were splayed, short or missing, correlating with the hearing deficits. The hearing
  defects were not reversed when hypoxia in ADA-/- mice was corrected. Progressive
  immune abnormalities were detected in ADA-/- mice from 4 days pp, initially affecting
  the thymus followed by peripheral lymphocytes and T cells in the spleen. ERT initiated
  at 7 days pp significantly improved the hearing of ADA-/- mice as well as the number
  of thymocytes and T lymphocytes, although not all normalized. Conclusions: ADA deficiency
  is associated with hearing deficits and damage to cochlear hair cells. Early initiation
  of ERT improves the hearing and immune abnormalities.'
