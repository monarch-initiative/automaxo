input_text: 'Host natural killer immunity is a key indicator of permissiveness for
  donor cell engraftment in patients with severe combined immunodeficiency.BACKGROUND:
  Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) can be cured by using allogeneic hematopoietic
  stem cell transplantation, and the absence of host immunity often obviates the need
  for preconditioning. Depending on the underlying genetic defect and when blocks
  in differentiation occur during lymphocyte ontogeny, infants with SCID have absent
  or greatly reduced numbers of functional T cells. Natural killer (NK) cell populations
  are usually absent in the SCID-X1 and Janus kinase 3 forms of SCID and greatly reduced
  in adenosine deaminase deficiency SCID but often present in other forms of the disorder.
  OBJECTIVE: To determine if SCID phenotypes indicate host permissiveness to donor
  cell engraftment. METHODS: A retrospective data analysis considered whether host
  NK cells influenced donor T-cell engraftment, immune reconstitution, and long-term
  outcomes in children who had undergone nonconditioned allogeneic stem cell transplantation
  between 1990 and 2011 in the United Kingdom. Detailed analysis of T- and B-cell
  immune reconstitution and donor chimerism was compared between the NK(+) (n = 24)
  and NK(-) (n = 53) forms of SCID. RESULTS: Overall, 77 children underwent transplantation,
  with survival of 90% in matched sibling donor/matched family donor transplants compared
  with 60% when alternative donors were used. Infants with NK(-)SCID were more likely
  to survive than NK(+) recipients (87% vs 62%, P < .01) and had high-level donor
  T-cell chimerism with superior long-term recovery of CD4 T-cell immunity. Notably,
  33% of children with NK(+)SCID required additional transplantation procedures compared
  with only 8% of children with NK(-)SCID (P < .005). CONCLUSIONS: NK(-)SCID disorders
  are highly permissive for donor T-cell engraftment without preconditioning, whereas
  the presence of NK cells is a strong indicator that preparative conditioning is
  required for engraftment of T-cell precursors capable of supporting robust T-cell
  reconstitution.'
