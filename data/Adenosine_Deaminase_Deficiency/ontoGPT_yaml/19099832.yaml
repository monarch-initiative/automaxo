input_text: '[Adenosine deaminase deficiency associated severe combined immunodeficiency
  with disseminated varicella infection after vaccination: a case report].OBJECTIVE:
  To enhance the knowledge of adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency associated severe
  combined immunodeficiency (SCID) with disseminated varicella infection after vaccination.
  METHODS: With case report and review of literature, the background knowledge, clinical
  and laboratory findings, diagnosis and treatment of ADA-deficient SCID were discussed.
  RESULTS: The patient had the condition with failure to thrive. The main complaint
  was more than three weeks of fever and rash. He had received the live attenuated
  Oka strain varicella vaccination approximately two weeks before the onset of rash.
  Varicella infection was confirmed with direct immunofluorescence assay. The patient
  had mild leukopenia, with 3% lymphocytes. The initial immunologic workup included
  decreased IgG, IgM and IgA, abnormal expanded lymphocyte enumeration which confirmed
  the reduction of CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19 and CD56. Enzyme testing for ADA activity showed
  remarkably low level in the hemolysate, as well as increased levels of deoxyadenosine
  nucleotides. CONCLUSION: ADA-deficient SCID has some characteristic clinical and
  laboratory findings. Management options for ADA-deficient SCID include hematopoietic
  stem cell transplantation, enzyme replacement therapy and gene therapy. Immunodeficiency
  should be considered in children with severe failure-to-thrive. Live vaccine administration
  should be avoided in patients with immunodeficiency.'
