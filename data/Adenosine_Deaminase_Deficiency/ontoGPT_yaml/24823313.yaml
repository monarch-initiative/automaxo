input_text: 'Gene therapy for inherited immunodeficiency.INTRODUCTION: During the
  last decade, gene therapy has emerged as a convincing therapy for primary immunodeficiencies
  (PIDs). Ex vivo gene transfer into autologous hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) via
  viral vectors permits sustained correction of T cell immunodeficiency in two forms
  of severe combined immunodeficiency: X-linked SCID (SCID-X1) (gamma chain [gammac]
  deficiency) and adenosine deaminase deficiency. However, this success has been balanced
  by the occurrence of genotoxicity generated by the integration of first-generation
  retroviral vectors. Recently, the development of safer self-inactivating vectors
  has led to the initiation of new studies with the hope of equivalent efficacy and
  a better safety profile. AREAS COVERED: This review article focuses on the updated
  results of gene therapy trials for PIDs - from early studies to ongoing clinical
  trials. We detail the major advances made in gene transfer and repair technologies,
  and discuss the many ways to extend our present experience. EXPERT OPINION: With
  optimization in terms of safety and efficacy, gene therapy by lentiviral transduction
  could become a compelling alternative to allogeneic HSC transplantation, and thus
  may take center stage in the management of PIDs in coming years.'
