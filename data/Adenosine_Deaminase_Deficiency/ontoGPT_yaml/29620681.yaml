input_text: 'Immune Thrombocytopenia as Key Feature of a Novel ADA2 Deficiency Variant:
  Implication on Differential Diagnostics of ITP in Children.Thrombocytopenia presenting
  during early childhood is most commonly diagnosed as immune/idiopathic thrombocytopenic
  purpura (ITP), where the antibody-mediated destruction of thrombocytes is often
  transient. If treatment is indicated, the majority of patients respond to immune-modulation
  by intravenous immunoglobulin G infusion or systemic corticosteroids. Differential
  diagnoses to childhood ITP includes thrombocytopenia due to infections, drugs, rheumatologic
  conditions, immune dysregulation, and inherited bone marrow failures, for example,
  congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia. Isolated thrombocytopenia in an otherwise
  healthy appearing child that recurs after therapy and/or persists suggest a differential
  diagnosis rather than ITP. We present a case of symptomatic thrombocytopenia in
  a 2-year-old girl associated with adenosine deaminase deficiency.'
