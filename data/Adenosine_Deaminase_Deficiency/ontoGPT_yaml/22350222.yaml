input_text: Non-infectious lung disease in patients with adenosine deaminase deficient
  severe combined immunodeficiency.Adenosine deaminase deficiency is a disorder of
  purine metabolism manifesting severe combined immunodeficiency (ADA-SCID) and systemic
  abnormalities. Increased levels of the substrate deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP)
  lead to immunodeficiency and are associated in a murine model with pulmonary insufficiency.
  We compared a cohort of patients with ADA-SCID and X-linked SCID and found that
  despite similar radiological and respiratory findings, positive microbiology is
  significantly less frequent in ADA-SCID patients (p < 0.0005), suggesting a metabolic
  pathogenesis for the lung disease. Clinicians should be aware of this possibility
  and correct metabolic abnormalities either through enzyme replacement or haematopoietic
  stem cell transplant, in addition to treating infectious complications.
