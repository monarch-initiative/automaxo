input_text: 'Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis in patients with adenosine deaminase deficiency.BACKGROUND:
  Inherited defects in the function of adenosine deaminase (ADA) cause severe combined
  immunodeficiency (SCID) and affect many other cells and tissues. OBJECTIVES: We
  sought to characterize the frequency and features of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis
  (PAP) in patients with ADA deficiency. METHODS: Clinical and laboratory features
  of all patients with SCID caused by ADA deficiency in a single center were analyzed.
  Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and lung biopsy specimens were stained with hematoxylin
  and eosin and periodic acid-Schiff, visualized by means of electron microscopy,
  and studied for associated infections. As a control group, BAL fluid and biopsy
  specimens from 22 patients with SCID caused by other genetic abnormalities were
  similarly assessed. RESULTS: Among 16 consecutive patients with ADA deficiency,
  7 had BAL fluid containing periodic acid-Schiff-positive surfactant-like material
  with macrophages engulfing degenerating lamellar bodies and/or lung biopsy specimens
  with alveolar spaces filled with homogeneous granular eosinophilic material and
  large macrophages. The lung pathology was typical of PAP. Identification of various
  pathogens coincided with PAP in 3 of these patients. We have diagnosed PAP among
  patients with ADA deficiency more commonly in the last 10 years than previously
  (P= .05), likely reflecting increased awareness of this condition. There were no
  significant differences in the clinical or immunologic characteristics between patients
  with ADA deficiency with or without PAP. Similar findings of PAP were not found
  among patients with SCID caused by other genetic abnormalities (P= .001). ADA coupled
  to polyethylene glycol or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation rapidly
  corrected this pulmonary complication. PAP seems to have contributed to the death
  of only 1 patient with ADA deficiency. CONCLUSIONS: ADA deficiency predisposes to
  the development of PAP, which could be reversed after enzyme replacement or transplantation.'
