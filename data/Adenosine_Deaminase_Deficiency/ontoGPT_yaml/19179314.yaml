input_text: 'Gene therapy for immunodeficiency due to adenosine deaminase deficiency.BACKGROUND:
  We investigated the long-term outcome of gene therapy for severe combined immunodeficiency
  (SCID) due to the lack of adenosine deaminase (ADA), a fatal disorder of purine
  metabolism and immunodeficiency. METHODS: We infused autologous CD34+ bone marrow
  cells transduced with a retroviral vector containing the ADA gene into 10 children
  with SCID due to ADA deficiency who lacked an HLA-identical sibling donor, after
  nonmyeloablative conditioning with busulfan. Enzyme-replacement therapy was not
  given after infusion of the cells. RESULTS: All patients are alive after a median
  follow-up of 4.0 years (range, 1.8 to 8.0). Transduced hematopoietic stem cells
  have stably engrafted and differentiated into myeloid cells containing ADA (mean
  range at 1 year in bone marrow lineages, 3.5 to 8.9%) and lymphoid cells (mean range
  in peripheral blood, 52.4 to 88.0%). Eight patients do not require enzyme-replacement
  therapy, their blood cells continue to express ADA, and they have no signs of defective
  detoxification of purine metabolites. Nine patients had immune reconstitution with
  increases in T-cell counts (median count at 3 years, 1.07x10(9) per liter) and normalization
  of T-cell function. In the five patients in whom intravenous immune globulin replacement
  was discontinued, antigen-specific antibody responses were elicited after exposure
  to vaccines or viral antigens. Effective protection against infections and improvement
  in physical development made a normal lifestyle possible. Serious adverse events
  included prolonged neutropenia (in two patients), hypertension (in one), central-venous-catheter-related
  infections (in two), Epstein-Barr virus reactivation (in one), and autoimmune hepatitis
  (in one). CONCLUSIONS: Gene therapy, combined with reduced-intensity conditioning,
  is a safe and effective treatment for SCID in patients with ADA deficiency. (ClinicalTrials.gov
  numbers, NCT00598481 and NCT00599781.)'
