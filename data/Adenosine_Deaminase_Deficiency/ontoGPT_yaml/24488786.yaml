input_text: Gene transfer into hematopoietic stem cells as treatment for primary immunodeficiency
  diseases.Gene transfer into the hematopoietic stem cell has shown curative potential
  for a variety of hematological disorders. Primary immunodeficiency diseases have
  led to the way in this field of gene therapy as an example and a model. Clinical
  results from the past 15 years have shown that significant improvement and even
  cure can be achieved for diseases such as X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency,
  adenosine deaminase deficiency, chronic granulomatous disease and Wiskott-Aldrich
  syndrome. Unfortunately, with the initial clear clinical benefits, the first serious
  complications of gene therapy have also occurred. In a significant number of patients
  treated using vectors based on murine gamma-retroviruses and carrying powerful viral
  enhancer elements, insertional oncogenesis events have resulted in acute leukemias
  that, in some cases, have had fatal outcomes. These serious adverse events have
  sparked a revision of the assessment of risks and benefits of integrating gene transfer
  for hematological diseases and prompted the development and application of new generations
  of viral vectors with recognized superior safety characteristics. This review summarizes
  the clinical experience of gene therapy for primary immunodeficiencies and discusses
  the likely avenues of progress in the future development of this expanding field
  of clinical investigations.
