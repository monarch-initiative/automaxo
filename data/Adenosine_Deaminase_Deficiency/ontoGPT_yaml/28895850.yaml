input_text: Gene Therapy Approaches to Immunodeficiency.Transfer of gene-corrected
  autologous hematopoietic stem cells in patients with primary immunodeficiencies
  has emerged as a new therapeutic approach. Patients with various conditions lacking
  a suitable donor have been treated with retroviral vectors and a gene-addition strategy.
  Initial promising results were shadowed by the occurrence of malignancies in some
  of these patients. Current trials, developed in the last decade, use safer viral
  vectors to overcome the risk of genotoxicity and have led to improved clinical outcomes.
  This review reflects the progresses made in specific disorders, including adenosine
  deaminase deficiency, X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency, chronic granulomatous
  disease, and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.
