input_text: 'History of gene therapy.Two decades after the initial gene therapy trials
  and more than 1700 approved clinical trials worldwide we not only have gained much
  new information and knowledge regarding gene therapy in general, but also learned
  to understand the concern that has persisted in society. Despite the setbacks gene
  therapy has faced, success stories have increasingly emerged. Examples for these
  are the positive recommendation for a gene therapy product (Glybera) by the EMA
  for approval in the European Union and the positive trials for the treatment of
  ADA deficiency, SCID-X1 and adrenoleukodystrophy. Nevertheless, our knowledge continues
  to grow and during the course of time more safety data has become available that
  helps us to develop better gene therapy approaches. Also, with the increased understanding
  of molecular medicine, we have been able to develop more specific and efficient
  gene transfer vectors which are now producing clinical results. In this review,
  we will take a historical view and highlight some of the milestones that had an
  important impact on the development of gene therapy. We will also discuss briefly
  the safety and ethical aspects of gene therapy and address some concerns that have
  been connected with gene therapy as an important therapeutic modality. '
