input_text: 'Progress and prospects: gene therapy for inherited immunodeficiencies.Haematopoietic
  stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is now widely used to treat primary immunodeficiencies
  (PID). For patients with specific disorders (severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)-X1,
  adenosine deaminase deficiency (ADA)-SCID, X-chronic granulomatous disease (CGD)
  and Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome (WAS)) who lack a suitable human leukocyte antigen
  (HLA)-matched donor, gene therapy has offered an important alternative treatment
  option. The success of gene therapy can be attributed, in part, to the selective
  advantage offered to gene-corrected cells, the avoidance of graft-versus-host disease
  and to the use of pre-conditioning in patients with chemotherapy to facilitate engraftment
  of corrected cells. Adverse events have been encountered and this has led to detailed
  characterization of retroviral vector integration profiles. A new generation of
  self-inactivating retroviral and lentiviral vectors have been designed to address
  these safety concerns, and are at an advanced stage of preparation for the next
  phase of clinical testing.'
