input_text: 'Gene Therapy for Adenosine Deaminase Deficiency: A Comprehensive Evaluation
  of Short- and Medium-Term Safety.Loss of adenosine deaminase activity leads to severe
  combined immunodeficiency (ADA-SCID); production and function of T, B, and natural
  killer (NK) cells are impaired. Gene therapy (GT) with an autologous CD34+-enriched
  cell fraction that contains CD34+ cells transduced with a retroviral vector encoding
  the human ADA cDNA sequence leads to immune reconstitution in most patients. Here,
  we report short- and medium-term safety analyses from 18 patients enrolled as part
  of single-arm, open-label studies or compassionate use programs. Survival was 100%
  with a median of 6.9 years follow-up (range, 2.3 to 13.4 years). Adverse events
  were mostly grade 1 or grade 2 and were reported by all 18 patients following GT.
  Thirty-nine serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported by 15 of 18 patients; no
  SAEs were considered related to GT. The most common adverse events reported post-GT
  include upper respiratory tract infection, gastroenteritis, rhinitis, bronchitis,
  oral candidiasis, cough, neutropenia, diarrhea, and pyrexia. Incidence rates for
  all of these events were highest during pre-treatment, treatment, and/or 3-month
  follow-up and then declined over medium-term follow-up. GT did not impact the incidence
  of neurologic/hearing impairments. No event indicative of leukemic transformation
  was reported.'
