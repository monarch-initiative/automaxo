input_text: '[Gene therapy for severe combined immunodeficiency].New results with
  gene therapy for severe combined immunodeficiency due to adenosine deaminase deficiency
  are promising. We review a clinical project in which ten children were treated with
  gene modified autologous haematopoietic stem cells. After treatment, eight patients
  were able to do without enzyme-replacement therapy, and nine patients showed improved
  immune function and sustained low concentration of toxic metabolites. No clonal
  outgrow was observed indicating a limited risk for future malignant development.
  Despite these promising results, the safety of gene therapy can still be improved.'
