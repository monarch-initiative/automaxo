input_text: 'Beware the lymphopenia: a case of severe combined immunodeficiency.We
  present a case of a 2-month-old boy with partially treated meningitis and suspected
  Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. A full blood count revealed profound lymphopenia.
  The child was diagnosed with adenosine deaminase deficiency, a rare cause of severe
  combined immunodeficiency (SCID). SCID is an immunological emergency and must be
  considered in any lymphopaenic infant with opportunistic infection. We discuss adenosine
  deaminase-deficient SCID, which can involve multiple systems and in which other
  treatment options apart from bone marrow transplant are available.'
