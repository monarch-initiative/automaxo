input_text: Towards gene therapy for the central nervous system.Gene therapy has generated
  enormous scientific, medical and public interest over the last decade. Clinical
  trials involving approximately 2000 patients worldwide have targeted simple genetic
  diseases such as cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy, adenosine deaminase deficiency,
  Gaucher's disease and familial hypercholesterolemia, as well as complex acquired
  diseases such as cancer and AIDS. The central nervous system is a new and particularly
  exciting target for gene therapy because its unique properties prevent the successful
  treatment of many neurological disorders by conventional means. This review discusses
  the potential applications of in vivo gene therapy to neurological disorders that
  have the greatest potential for genetic treatments.
