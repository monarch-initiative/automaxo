input_text: Patients with adenosine deaminase deficiency surviving after hematopoietic
  stem cell transplantation are at high risk of CNS complications.Adenosine deaminase
  (ADA) deficiency is a systemic metabolic disease that causes an autosomal recessive
  variant of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and less consistently other complications
  including neurologic abnormalities. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)
  is able to correct the immunodeficiency, whereas control of nonimmunologic complications
  has not been extensively explored. We applied HSCT in 15 ADA-deficient patients
  consecutively treated at our institutions since 1982 and analyzed long-term outcome.
  Seven patients received transplants without conditioning from HLA-matched family
  donors (MFDs); the other 8 patients received conditioning and were given transplants
  either from HLA-mismatched family donors (MMFDs; n = 6) or from matched unrelated
  donors (MUDs; n = 2). At a mean follow-up period of 12 years (range, 4-22 years),
  12 patients are alive with stable and complete immune reconstitution (7 of 7 after
  MFD, 4 of 6 after MMFD, and 1 of 2 after MUD transplantation). Six of 12 surviving
  patients show marked neurologic abnormalities, which include mental retardation,
  motor dysfunction, and sensorineural hearing deficit. We were unable to identify
  disease or transplantation-related factors correlating with this divergent neurologic
  outcome. The high rate of neurologic abnormalities observed in long-term surviving
  patients with ADA deficiency indicates that HSCT commonly fails to control CNS complications
  in this metabolic disease.
