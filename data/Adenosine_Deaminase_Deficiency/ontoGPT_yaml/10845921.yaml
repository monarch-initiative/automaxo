input_text: A(2A) receptor dependent and A(2A) receptor independent effects of extracellular
  adenosine on murine thymocytes in conditions of adenosine deaminase deficiency.Adenosine
  deaminase (ADA) deficiency causes severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and is
  accompanied by T-cell depletion and accumulation of both intracellular and extracellular
  adenosine (extAdo) and deoxyadenosine. To better understand the causes of T-cell
  depletion in vivo and to discriminate between extracellular and intracellular effects
  of exogenously added adenosine in vitro, we investigated mechanisms of 2 different
  effects of adenosine on murine thymocytes. These effects of adenosine include direct
  induction of apoptosis in about 6% to 15% thymocytes and inhibition of T-cell receptor
  (TCR)-induced activation of the majority of thymocytes with inhibited ADA. A(2A)
  adenosine receptors, but not A(2B), A(1), or A(3) receptors, are shown to be mostly
  responsible for extAdo-triggered signaling (cyclic adenosine monophosphate [cAMP]
  accumulation) in murine thymocytes and this prompted studies of the effects of extAdo
  on thymocytes from A(2A)R gene-deficient mice. It is found that direct apoptotic
  effects of extAdo on CD4(+)CD8(+) double positive (DP) thymocytes are completely
  accounted for by signaling through A(2A)R, with no contribution of intracellular
  lymphotoxicity or of compensating A(2B)Rs because only A(2A)R +/+, but not A(2A)R
  -/- thymocytes were susceptible to apoptotic effects of extAdo. Studies of the effects
  of cAMP-raising agents support observations of extAdo/A(2A)R/cAMP-triggered apoptosis
  in DP thymocytes. Unexpectedly, the extAdo strongly inhibited TCR-triggered activation
  of both A(2A)R +/+ and A(2A)R -/- thymocytes in the presence of ADA inhibitors.
  This was confirmed with thymocytes from ADA gene-deficient mice, suggesting the
  existence of A(2A)R-independent effects of extAdo on thymocytes. The presented data
  raises questions about the identity and functional role of A(2A)R-expressing thymocytes
  in T-cell differentiation and of the role of TCR-antagonizing effects of extAdo
  in conditions of ADA SCID. (Blood. 2000;95:3859-3867)
