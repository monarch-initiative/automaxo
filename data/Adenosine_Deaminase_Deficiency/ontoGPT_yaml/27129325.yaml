input_text: 'Update on the safety and efficacy of retroviral gene therapy for immunodeficiency
  due to adenosine deaminase deficiency.Adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency is a
  rare, autosomal-recessive systemic metabolic disease characterized by severe combined
  immunodeficiency (SCID). The treatment of choice for ADA-deficient SCID (ADA-SCID)
  is hematopoietic stem cell transplant from an HLA-matched sibling donor, although
  <25% of patients have such a donor available. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) partially
  and temporarily relieves immunodeficiency. We investigated the medium-term outcome
  of gene therapy (GT) in 18 patients with ADA-SCID for whom an HLA-identical family
  donor was not available; most were not responding well to ERT. Patients were treated
  with an autologous CD34(+)-enriched cell fraction that contained CD34(+) cells transduced
  with a retroviral vector encoding the human ADA complementary DNA sequence (GSK2696273)
  as part of single-arm, open-label studies or compassionate use programs. Overall
  survival was 100% over 2.3 to 13.4 years (median, 6.9 years). Gene-modified cells
  were stably present in multiple lineages throughout follow up. GT resulted in a
  sustained reduction in the severe infection rate from 1.17 events per person-year
  to 0.17 events per person-year (n = 17, patient 1 data not available). Immune reconstitution
  was demonstrated by normalization of T-cell subsets (CD3(+), CD4(+), and CD8(+)),
  evidence of thymopoiesis, and sustained T-cell proliferative capacity. B-cell function
  was evidenced by immunoglobulin production, decreased intravenous immunoglobulin
  use, and antibody response after vaccination. All 18 patients reported infections
  as adverse events; infections of respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts were reported
  most frequently. No events indicative of leukemic transformation were reported.
  Trial details were registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00598481.'
