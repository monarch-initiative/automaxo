input_text: "Tandem mass spectrometry, but not T-cell receptor excision circle analysis,
  identifies newborns with late-onset adenosine deaminase deficiency.BACKGROUND: Adenosine
  deaminase (ADA)-severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is caused by genetic variants
  that disrupt the function of ADA. In its early-onset form, it is rapidly fatal to
  infants. Delayed or late-onset ADA-SCID is characterized by insidious progressive
  immunodeficiency that leads to permanent organ damage or death. Quantification of
  T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) or tandem mass spectrometry (tandem-MS)
  analysis of dried blood spots (DBSs) collected at birth can identify newborns with
  early-onset ADA-SCID and are used in screening programs. However, it is not clear
  whether these analyses can identify newborns who will have delayed or late-onset
  ADA-SCID before symptoms appear. OBJECTIVE: We performed a retrospective study to
  evaluate whether tandem-MS and quantitative TREC analyses of DBSs could identify
  newborns who had delayed-onset ADA-SCID later in life. METHODS: We tested stored
  DBSs collected at birth from 3 patients with delayed-onset ADA-SCID using tandem-MS
  (PCT EP2010/070517) to evaluate levels of adenosine and 2'-deoxyadenosine and real-time
  PCR to quantify TREC levels. We also analyzed DBSs from 3 newborns with early-onset
  ADA-SCID and 2 healthy newborn carriers of ADA deficiency. RESULTS: The DBSs taken
  at birth from the 3 patients with delayed-onset ADA-SCID had adenosine levels of
  10, 25, and 19 mumol/L (normal value, <1.5 mumol/L) and 2'-deoxyadenosine levels
  of 0.7, 2.7, and 2.4 mumol/L (normal value, <0.07 mumol/L); the mean levels of adenosine
  and 2'-deoxyadenosine were respectively 12.0- and 27.6-fold higher than normal values.
  DBSs taken at birth from all 3 patients with delayed-onset ADA deficiency had normal
  TREC levels, but TRECs were undetectable in blood samples taken from the same patients
  at the time of diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Tandem-MS but not TREC quantification identifies
  newborns with delayed- or late-onset ADA deficiency."
