input_text: "Normal IgH Repertoire Diversity in an Infant with ADA Deficiency After
  Gene Therapy.PURPOSE: Adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency causes severe combined
  immunodeficiency (SCID) through an accumulation of toxic metabolites within lymphocytes.
  Recently, ADA deficiency has been successfully treated using lentiviral-transduced
  autologous CD34+ cells carrying the ADA gene. T and B cell function appears to be
  fully restored, but in many patients' B cell numbers remain low, and assessments
  of the immunoglobulin heavy (IgHV) repertoire following gene therapy are lacking.
  METHODS: We performed deep sequencing of IgHV repertoire in peripheral blood lymphocytes
  from a child following lentivirus-based gene therapy for ADA deficiency and compared
  to the IgHV repertoire in healthy infants and adults. RESULTS: After gene therapy,
  Ig diversity increased over time as evidenced by V, D, and J gene usage, N-additions,
  CDR3 length, extent of somatic hypermutation, and Ig class switching. There was
  the emergence of predominant IgHM, IgHG, and IgHA CDR3 lengths after gene therapy
  indicating successful oligoclonal expansion in response to antigens. This provides
  proof of concept for the feasibility and utility of molecular monitoring in following
  B cell reconstitution following gene therapy for ADA deficiency. CONCLUSION: Based
  on deep sequencing, gene therapy resulted in an IgHV repertoire with molecular diversity
  similar to healthy infants."
