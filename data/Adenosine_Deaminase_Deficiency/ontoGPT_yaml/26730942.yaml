input_text: 'Alveolar-like Stem Cell-derived Myb(-) Macrophages Promote Recovery and
  Survival in Airway Disease.RATIONALE: Abnormal alveolar macrophages (AM) are found
  in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, cystic fibrosis, and adenosine
  deaminase deficiency (ADA(-/-)). There is no specific treatment strategy to compensate
  for these innate immune abnormalities. Recent findings suggest AMs are of early
  embryonic or fetal origin. Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) as a source of embryonic-derived
  AMs for therapeutic use in acute and chronic airway diseases has yet to be investigated.
  OBJECTIVES: To determine if embryonic Myb(-/-) alveolar-like macrophages have therapeutic
  value on pulmonary transplantation in acute and chronic airway diseases. METHODS:
  Directed differentiation of murine PSCs was used in factor-defined media to produce
  expandable embryonic macrophages conditioned to an alveolar-like phenotype with
  granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. AMs were partially depleted in
  mice to create an acute lung injury. To model a chronic lung disease, ADA(-/-) mice
  were used. Alveolar-like macrophages were intratracheally transplanted to the injured
  animals and therapeutic potential was determined. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:
  The differentiation protocol is highly efficient and adaptable to human PSCs. The
  PSC macrophages are phenotypically like AMs both functionally and by ligand marker
  characterization. They engulf bacteria and apoptotic cells and are better phagocytes
  than bone marrow-derived macrophages. In vivo, these macrophages remain in healthy
  airways for at least 4 weeks, can engulf neutrophils during acute lung injury, enhance
  pulmonary tissue repair, and promote survival in ADA(-/-) mice. Animals receiving
  the macrophages do not develop abnormal pathology or teratomas. CONCLUSIONS: PSCs
  are a reliable source to produce therapeutically active alveolar-like macrophages
  to treat airway disease.'
