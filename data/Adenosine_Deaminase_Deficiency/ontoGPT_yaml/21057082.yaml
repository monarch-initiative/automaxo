input_text: The different extent of B and T cell immune reconstitution after hematopoietic
  stem cell transplantation and enzyme replacement therapies in SCID patients with
  adenosine deaminase deficiency.The lack of adenosine deaminase (ADA) leads to the
  accumulation of toxic metabolites, resulting in SCID. If the disease is left untreated,
  it is likely to have a fatal outcome in early infancy. Because hematopoietic stem
  cell transplantation (HSCT) and enzyme replacement therapy with pegylated bovine
  ADA (PEG-ADA) are both provided in our hospital, we undertook a retrospective longitudinal
  comparative study of the extent of lymphocyte recovery in two groups of treated
  ADA-SCID children. Together with classical immunological parameters, we quantified
  the output of the new B and T cells from the production sites using the kappa-deleting
  recombination excision circle and TCR excision circle assay, and we monitored T
  cell repertoire diversification. We found that immune reconstitution was different
  following the two treatments. The stable production of kappa-deleting recombination
  excision circle(+) lymphocytes sustained an increase in B cell number in HSCT-treated
  patients, whereas in PEG-ADA-treated patients, it was accompanied by a significant
  and progressive decrease in circulating CD19(+) lymphocytes, which never reached
  the levels observed in age-matched children. The mobilization of TCR excision circle(+)
  cells, though lower than in controls, was stable with time after HSCT treatment,
  leading to a constant peripheral T cell number and to the diversification of the
  T cell repertoire; however, it was compromised in children receiving prolonged PEG-ADA
  therapy, whose T cells showed progressively narrowing T cell repertoires.
