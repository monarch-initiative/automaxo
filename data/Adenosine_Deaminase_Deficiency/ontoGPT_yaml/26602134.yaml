input_text: 'Urine Purine Metabolite Determination by UPLC-Tandem Mass Spectrometry.Inborn
  errors of purine metabolism, either deficiencies of synthesis or catabolism pathways,
  lead to a wide spectrum of clinical presentations: urolithiasis (adenine phosphoribosyltransferase),
  primary immune deficiency (adenosine deaminase deficiency and purine nucleoside
  phosphorylase deficiency), severe intellectual disability, and other neurological
  symptoms (Lesch-Nyhan disease, adenylosuccinase deficiency, and molybdenum cofactor
  deficiency). A rapid quantitative purine assay was developed using UPLC-MS/MS to
  determine purine nucleoside and base concentrations in urine. Taking advantages
  of ultra performance liquid chromatography, we achieved satisfactory analyte separation
  and recovery with a polar T3 column in a short run time with no requirement of time-consuming
  sample preparation or derivatization. This targeted assay is intended for diagnosis
  and management of purine diseases, newborn screening follow-up of SCID, and evaluation
  of autism spectrum disorders.'
