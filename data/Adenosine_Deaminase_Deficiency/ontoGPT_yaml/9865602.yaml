input_text: 'Elevation of serum IgE level and peripheral eosinophil count during T
  lymphocyte-directed gene therapy for ADA deficiency: implication of Tc2-like cells
  after gene transduction procedure.We have successfully carried out T-cell-directed
  gene therapy for a boy with severe combined immunodeficiency due to adenosine deaminase
  deficiency (ADA SCID) and unexpectedly found an elevation of serum IgE level and
  peripheral eosinophil count during the course. More than 90% of transduced cells
  cultured for 7-11 days before infusion into the patient were positive for CD8 and
  expressed Th2-type cytokine genes such as IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13. Furthermore, CD4(+)
  T-depleted PBMC (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) from the patient synthesized
  IgE in vitro by stimulation with IL-4. Collectively, these results suggested that
  Tc2-like cells in the transduced cells have distinct immunological functions to
  help IgE synthesis and activate eosinophils.'
