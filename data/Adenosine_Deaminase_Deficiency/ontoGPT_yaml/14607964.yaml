input_text: Impaired germinal center maturation in adenosine deaminase deficiency.Mice
  deficient in the enzyme adenosine deaminase (ADA) have small lymphoid organs that
  contain reduced numbers of peripheral lymphocytes, and they are immunodeficient.
  We investigated B cell deficiency in ADA-deficient mice and found that B cell development
  in the bone marrow was normal. However, spleens were markedly smaller, their architecture
  was dramatically altered, and splenic B lymphocytes showed defects in proliferation
  and activation. ADA-deficient B cells exhibited a higher propensity to undergo B
  cell receptor-mediated apoptosis than their wild-type counterparts, suggesting that
  ADA plays a role in the survival of cells during Ag-dependent responses. In keeping
  with this finding, IgM production by extrafollicular plasmablast cells was higher
  in ADA-deficient than in wild-type mice, thus indicating that activated B cells
  accumulate extrafollicularly as a result of a poor or nonexistent germinal center
  formation. This hypothesis was subsequently confirmed by the profound loss of germinal
  center architecture. A comparison of levels of the ADA substrates, adenosine and
  2'-deoxyadenosine, as well resulting dATP levels and S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase
  inhibition in bone marrow and spleen suggested that dATP accumulation in ADA-deficient
  spleens may be responsible for impaired B cell development. The altered splenic
  environment and signaling abnormalities may concurrently contribute to a block in
  B cell Ag-dependent maturation in ADA-deficient mouse spleens.
