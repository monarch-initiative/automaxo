input_text: Gene therapy for severe combined immune deficiency.Infants born with severe
  combined immune deficiencies are prone to life-threatening infections and, without
  treatment, do not survive beyond the first year of life. Haematopoietic stem cell
  transplantation from a fully matched donor offers the possibility of cure. In the
  absence of a suitable matched donor, haploidentical transplants from a parental
  donor may be undertaken, but these are associated with more complications and lower
  success rates. Recently, an alternative therapeutic option based on retroviral gene
  delivery has been used to correct X-linked severe combined immune deficiency (SCID-X1)
  and adenosine deaminase deficiency. Clinical trials have established that in situations
  where ex vivo gene transfer into haematopoietic progenitor cells confers a strong
  selective advantage, the procedure is a feasible alternative to haploidentical transplantation,
  with favourable kinetics of immune reconstitution.
