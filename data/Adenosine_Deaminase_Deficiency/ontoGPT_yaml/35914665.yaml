input_text: 'Newborn tandem mass spectroscopy screening for adenosine deaminase deficiency.BACKGROUND:
  Newborn screening (NBS) by means of T cell receptor excision circles (TREC) is now
  universal in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Navajo Nation as a strategy
  to identify severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) in newborns. Owing to the characteristics
  of adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency, a small but important number of cases can
  be missed by this screening. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the results of the first year
  statewide NBS for ADA by means of dried blood spot NBS. METHODS: On October 7, 2019,
  the state of Michigan began screening newborn dried blood spots for ADA deficiency
  by means of the Neobase-2 tandem mass spectroscopy (TMS) kit. We report 1 known
  case of ADA deficiency in the 18 months before screening. We then reviewed the results
  of the first 2 years of TMS ADA screening in Michigan. RESULTS: There was 1 patient
  with ADA deficiency known to our centers in the 18 months before initiation of TMS
  ADA screening; this patient died of complications of their disease. In the first
  2 years of TMS ADA NBS, 206,321 infants were screened, and 2 patients had positive
  ADA screen results. Both patients had ADA deficiency confirmed through biochemical
  and genetic testing. One patient identified also had a positive TREC screen and
  was confirmed to have ADA-SCID. CONCLUSION: In our first 2 years, TMS NBS for ADA
  deficiency identified 2 patients with ADA deficiency at negligible cost, including
  1 patient who would not have been identified by TREC NBS. This report provides initial
  evidence of the value of specific NBS for ADA deficiency.'
