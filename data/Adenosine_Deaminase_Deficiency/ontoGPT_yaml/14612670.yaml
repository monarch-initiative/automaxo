input_text: 'Gene therapy for adenosine deaminase deficiency.PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Gene
  therapy for severe combined immunodeficiency due to adenosine deaminase deficiency
  has moved from the early trials of safety and feasibility to recent studies demonstrating
  efficacy and clinical benefit. This review describes the latest advances in gene
  therapy trials for this condition using peripheral blood lymphocytes or hematopoietic
  progenitors. RECENT FINDINGS: In the first patients with severe combined immunodeficiency
  due to adenosine deaminase deficiency treated with peripheral blood lymphocytes,
  transduced T cells have been shown to persist for over 10 years, expressing transgenic
  adenosine deaminase, but the therapeutic effect of gene therapy remained difficult
  to assess because of the concomitant treatment with bovine adenosine deaminase conjugated
  to polyethylene-glycol (PEG-ADA). A recent report showed that discontinuation of
  PEG-ADA resulted in a strong selective advantage of gene corrected T cells associated
  with restoration of T cell functions and antibody responses to neoantigen, but incomplete
  correction of the metabolic defect. Follow-up studies in patients treated with engineered
  hematopoietic progenitors in the early trials revealed low marking levels of long-term
  living progenitors and limited clinical effect. Recently, an improved gene transfer
  protocol in bone marrow CD34+ cells combined with low-dose busulfan resulted in
  multilineage, stable engraftment of transduced progenitors at substantial levels,
  restoration of immune functions, correction of the adenosine deaminase metabolic
  defect, and proven clinical benefit, in the absence of PEG-ADA. Overall, no adverse
  effect or toxicity has been observed in patients treated with adenosine deaminase
  gene transfer in mature lymphocytes or hematopoietic progenitors. SUMMARY: Gene
  transfer in hematopoietic stem cells combined with nonmyeloablative conditioning
  is efficacious and might be extended to the treatment of other inherited and acquired
  disorders of the hematopoietic system.'
