input_text: Gene therapy of genetic diseases and cancer.The scope of gene transfer
  applications in human therapy has expanded enormously over the last 15 years to
  include not only several types of genetic diseases but also a variety of genetic
  approaches to the treatment of cancer. Hematopoietic stem cells have been considered
  excellent targets for therapeutic gene transfer because of their capacity for self-renewal
  and for differentiation into multiple cellular lineages. Retrovirus-mediated gene
  transfer has been tested for treatment of diseases that specifically affect the
  hematopoietic system, such as adenosine deaminase deficiency and chronic granulomatous
  disease. Storage disorders such as Gaucher disease, Hurler syndrome and Hunter syndrome,
  genetic deficiencies that affect a broad range of tissue types, may also be amenable
  to treatment by gene transfer into hematopoietic cells, owing to the release of
  enzyme expressed in transduced cells with subsequent uptake by untransduced cells
  ("metabolic cross-correction"). Hematopoietic stem cells may also be targeted for
  introduction of drug-resistance genes for the purpose of protecting normal tissues
  from the toxic side-effects of cancer chemotherapeutic agents, thus allowing more
  effective antitumor chemotherapy. The danger of introducing drug-resistance function
  into tumor cells may be dealt with by including sequences specifically designed
  to reduce expression of oncogenes or to restore expression of tumor suppressor genes.
  Current limitations on the efficiency of gene transfer into hematopoietic stem cells
  may be alleviated by the development of new vector systems such as adeno-associated
  virus or lentivirus vectors, or by advances in cell processing that render hematopoietic
  cells more susceptible to transduction. Drug-resistance genes may also be applied
  for in vivo selection to expand the representation of a small proportion of transduced
  hematopoietic cells. These approaches toward increasing the frequency of hematopoietic
  cell transduction contribute to the anticipated feasibility of gene therapy for
  genetic diseases and cancer.
