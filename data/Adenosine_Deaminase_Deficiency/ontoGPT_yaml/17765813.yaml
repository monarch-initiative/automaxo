input_text: Neurologic abnormalities in patients with adenosine deaminase deficiency.Defects
  in adenosine deaminase enzyme cause severe immunodeficiency. Without enzyme replacement
  or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, patients often suffer fatal infection
  in infancy. Adenosine deaminase is expressed ubiquitously; deficiency may affect
  various organs, including the brain. Neurologic abnormalities occur in some adenosine
  deaminase-deficient patients, mostly in association with infection or after bone
  marrow transplantation. Three cases with significant neurologic abnormalities, including
  hypotonia, head lag, nystagmus, difficulty in focusing gaze, seizure disorder, and
  moderate-severe developmental delay but with no evidence of infection or transplant-related
  medication toxicity are presented. Computed tomographic scans and cranial MRI revealed
  volume loss and abnormalities of basal ganglia and thalamus, which may reflect accelerated
  nerve cell death or altered stimulation of adenosine receptors. Detailed neurologic
  and neuroimaging evaluation should be performed for all patients with adenosine
  deaminase deficiency upon diagnosis, to identify potentially significant brain lesions.
