input_text: '[Gene therapy: a review 6 years after the first trials in man. Round
  Table No 6 at Giens XIII].The first protocol of gene therapy was started in 1990
  for two children with adenosine deaminase deficiency. In 1997, the field largely
  widened, with 2100 patients treated: 10 per cent suffer from hereditary disease,
  cystic fibrosis mainly, and 90 per cent acquired disease, mainly cancers or HIV
  infection. No toxicity of gene therapy has been observed for the patients or their
  environment. A psychological barrier has been crossed which might allow an easing
  of the regulations. Industrial firms are heavily engaged in this field and are defining
  the rules of production and use. After in vivo administration to patients, the gene
  is expressed but the vectorisation is still very weak. Gene therapy should thus
  be limited to indications with a well-established clinical and scientific rationale.'
