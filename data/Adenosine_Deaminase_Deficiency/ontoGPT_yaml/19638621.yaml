input_text: 'How I treat ADA deficiency.Adenosine deaminase deficiency is a disorder
  of purine metabolism leading to severe combined immunodeficiency (ADA-SCID). Without
  treatment, the condition is fatal and requires early intervention. Haematopoietic
  stem cell transplantation is the major treatment for ADA-SCID, although survival
  following different donor sources varies considerably. Unlike other SCID forms,
  2 other options are available for ADA-SCID: enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with
  pegylated bovine ADA, and autologous haematopoietic stem cell gene therapy (GT).
  Due to the rarity of the condition, the lack of large scale outcome studies, and
  availability of different treatments, guidance on treatment strategies is limited.
  We have reviewed the currently available evidence and together with our experience
  of managing this condition propose a consensus management strategy. Matched sibling
  donor transplants represent a successful treatment option with high survival rates
  and excellent immune recovery. Mismatched parental donor transplants have a poor
  survival outcome and should be avoided unless other treatments are unavailable.
  ERT and GT both show excellent survival, and therefore the choice between ERT, MUD
  transplant, or GT is difficult and dependent on several factors, including accessibility
  to the different modalities, response of patients to long-term ERT, and the attitudes
  of physicians and parents to the short- and potential long-term risks associated
  with different treatments.'
