input_text: "Gene Therapy with Hematopoietic Stem Cells: The Diseased Bone Marrow's
  Point of View.When considering inherited diseases that can be treated by gene transfer
  into hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), there are only two in which the HSC and progenitor
  cell distribution inside the bone marrow and its microenvironment are exactly the
  same as in a healthy subject: metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) and adrenoleukodystrophy
  (ALD). In all other settings [X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (X-SCID),
  adenosine deaminase deficiency, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, and beta-hemoglobinopathies],
  the bone marrow content of the different stem and precursor cells and the cells'
  relationship with the stroma have very specific characteristics. These peculiarities
  can influence the cells' harvesting and behavior in culture, and the postgraft uptake
  and further behavior of the gene-modified hematopoietic/precursor cells. In the
  present mini-review, we shall briefly summarize these characteristics and outline
  the possible consequences and challenges."
