input_text: Good Laboratory Practice Preclinical Safety Studies for GSK2696273 (MLV
  Vector-Based Ex Vivo Gene Therapy for Adenosine Deaminase Deficiency Severe Combined
  Immunodeficiency) in NSG Mice.GSK2696273 (autologous CD34+ cells transduced with
  retroviral vector that encodes for the human adenosine deaminase [ADA] enzyme) is
  a gamma-retroviral ex vivo gene therapy of bone marrow-derived CD34+ cells for the
  treatment of adenosine deaminase deficiency severe combined immunodeficiency (ADA-SCID).
  ADA-SCID is a severe monogenic disease characterized by immunologic and nonimmunologic
  symptoms. Bone-marrow transplant from a matched related donor is the treatment of
  choice, but it is available for only a small proportion of patients. Ex vivo gene
  therapy of patient bone-marrow CD34+ cells is an alternative treatment. In order
  to prepare for a marketing authorization application in the European Union, preclinical
  safety studies in mice were requested by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). A
  pilot study and a main biodistribution study were performed according to Good Laboratory
  Practice (GLP) at the San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy test facility.
  In the main study, human umbilical cord blood (UCB)-derived CD34+ cells were transduced
  with gamma-retroviral vector used in the production of GSK2696273. Groups of 10
  male and 10 female NOD-SCID gamma (NSG) mice were injected intravenously with a
  single dose of transduced- or mock-transduced UCB CD34+ cells, and they were observed
  for 4 months. Engraftment and multilineage differentiation of blood cells was observed
  in the majority of animals in both groups. There was no significant difference in
  the level of chimerism between the two groups. In the gene therapy group, vector
  was detectable in lymphohemopoietic and nonlymphohemopoietic tissues, consistent
  with the presence of gene-modified human hematopoietic donor cells. Given the absence
  of relevant safety concerns in the data, the nonclinical studies and the clinical
  experience with GSK2696273 supported a successful application for market authorization
  in the European Union for the treatment of ADA-SCID patients, for whom no suitable
  human leukocyte antigen-matched related donor is available.
