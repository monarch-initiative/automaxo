input_text: 'Stem cell gene therapy: the risks of insertional mutagenesis and approaches
  to minimize genotoxicity.Virus-based vectors are widely used in hematopoietic stem
  cell (HSC) gene therapy, and have the ability to integrate permanently into genomic
  DNA, thus driving long-term expression of corrective genes in all hematopoietic
  lineages. To date, HSC gene therapy has been successfully employed in the clinic
  for improving clinical outcomes in small numbers of patients with X-linked severe
  combined immunodeficiency (SCID-X1), adenosine deaminase deficiency (ADA-SCID),
  adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), thalassemia, chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), and
  Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS). However, adverse events were observed during some
  of these HSC gene therapy clinical trials, linked to insertional activation of proto-oncogenes
  by integrated proviral vectors leading to clonal expansion and eventual development
  of leukemia. Numerous studies have been performed to understand the molecular basis
  of vector-mediated genotoxicity, with the aim of developing safer vectors and lower-risk
  gene therapy protocols. This review will summarize current information on the mechanisms
  of insertional mutagenesis in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells due to integrating
  gene transfer vectors, discuss the available assays for predicting genotoxicity
  and mapping vector integration sites, and introduce newly-developed approaches for
  minimizing genotoxicity as a way to further move HSC gene therapy forward into broader
  clinical application.'
