input_text: 'Outcomes in two Japanese adenosine deaminase-deficiency patients treated
  by stem cell gene therapy with no cytoreductive conditioning.OBJECTIVE: We here
  describe treatment outcomes in two adenosine deaminase (ADA)-deficiency patients
  (pt) who received stem cell gene therapy (SCGT) with no cytoreductive conditioning.
  As this protocol has features distinct from those of other clinical trials, its
  results provide insights into SCGT for ADA deficiency. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Pt
  1 was treated at age 4.7 years, whereas pt 2, who had previously received T-cell
  gene therapy, was treated at age 13 years. Bone marrow CD34(+) cells were harvested
  after enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) was withdrawn; following transduction of
  ADA cDNA by the gamma-retroviral vector GCsapM-ADA, they were administered intravenously.
  No cytoreductive conditioning, at present considered critical for therapeutic benefit,
  was given before cell infusion. Hematological/immunological reconstitution kinetics,
  levels of systemic detoxification, gene-marking levels, and proviral insertion sites
  in hematopoietic cells were assessed. RESULTS: Treatment was well tolerated, and
  no serious adverse events were observed. Engraftment of gene-modified repopulating
  cells was evidenced by the appearance and maintenance of peripheral lymphocytes
  expressing functional ADA. Systemic detoxification was moderately achieved, allowing
  temporary discontinuation of ERT for 6 and 10 years in pt 1 and pt 2, respectively.
  Recovery of immunity remained partial, with lymphocyte counts in pts 1 and 2, peaked
  at 408/mm(3) and 1248/mm(3), approximately 2 and 5 years after SCGT. Vector integration
  site analyses confirmed that hematopoiesis was reconstituted with a limited number
  of clones, some of which were shown to have myelo-lymphoid potential. CONCLUSIONS:
  Outcomes in SCGT for ADA-SCID are described in the context of a unique protocol,
  which used neither ERT nor cytoreductive conditioning. Although proven safe, immune
  reconstitution was partial and temporary. Our results reiterate the importance of
  cytoreductive conditioning to ensure greater benefits from SCGT.'
