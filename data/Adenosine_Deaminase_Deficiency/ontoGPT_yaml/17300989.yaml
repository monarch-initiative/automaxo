input_text: Management options for adenosine deaminase deficiency; proceedings of
  the EBMT satellite workshop (Hamburg, March 2006).Adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency
  is a disorder of purine salvage that has its most devastating consequences in the
  immune system leading to severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). Management options
  for ADA SCID include hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, enzyme replacement
  therapy and gene therapy. Formal data on the outcome following each of the three
  treatment modalities are limited, and this symposium was held in order to gather
  together the experience from major centers in Europe and the US. Transplantation
  for ADA-SCID is highly successful with survival rates of approximately 90% if a
  matched sibling or matched related donor is available but survival following matched
  unrelated donor or haploidentical procedures is 63% and 50% respectively with a
  significant rejection/non-engraftment rate in unconditioned procedures. Successfully
  transplanted patients demonstrated good immunological recovery with normal cellular
  and humoral function in the majority of cases. PEG-ADA has been used in over 150
  patients worldwide either as an alternative to mismatched transplant or as a stabilizing
  measure prior to transplant. Overall, approximately two thirds of patients treated
  with PEG-ADA have survived with the majority of patients showing good clinical improvement.
  The level of immune recovery long term was less than that seen after transplant
  and approximately 50% of patients continued to receive immunoglobulin replacement.
  Gene therapy has been used as an experimental procedure in two centers in Europe.
  Early results from 9 patients suggest that the treatment is safe and that the majority
  have shown recovery of cellular immune function. Long-term follow-up of treated
  patients highlights a significant incidence of non-immunological problems with cognitive,
  neurological and audiological abnormalities most prominent.
