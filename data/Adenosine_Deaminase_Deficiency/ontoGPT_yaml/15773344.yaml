input_text: '[Gene therapy for adenosine deaminase deficiency].A four year-old boy
  with adenosine deaminase (ADA-) deficient severe combined immunodeficiency(SCID)
  receiving PEG-ADA was treated under a gene therapy protocol targeting peripheral
  blood lymphocytes (PBLs) in 1995. After eleven infusions of autologous PBLs transduced
  with retroviral vector LASN encoding ADAcDNA, he exhibited increased levels of the
  CD8+ T lymphocytes, serum immunoglobulin, specific antibodies and delayed type hypersensitivity
  skin tests. Follow-up studies also provided evidence of long-term persistence and
  function of transduced PBLs with improvement in the immune function. However, the
  therapeutic effect of this gene therapy has been difficult to assess because of
  the concomitant treatment of PEG-ADA. Two ADA-SCID patients have been currently
  treated with autologous bone marrow CD34+ cells engineered with a retroviral vector
  GCsapM-ADA after discontinuation of PEG-ADA. The restoration of intracellular ADA
  enzymatic activity in lymphocytes and granulocytes resulted in correction of the
  systemic toxicity and liver function in the absence of PEG-ADA treatment. Both patients
  are at home where they are clinically well, and they do not experience adversed
  effect, with follow up being 12 months after CD34+ cells gene therapy.'
