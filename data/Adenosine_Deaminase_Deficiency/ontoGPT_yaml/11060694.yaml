input_text: Adenosine deaminase deficiency as the first target disorder in gene therapy.In
  the past decade, the advent of gene therapy has been acclaimed as a revolutionary
  medical intervention, embraced with great enthusiasm. However, recent disappointing
  results of the considerable clinical trials have also clearly demonstrated that
  such an initial expectation was an overestimation of gene therapy. There are only
  a few successful cases despite the 3000 patients who have been treated with various
  forms of gene therapy. Gene therapy for severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)
  caused by adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency is one of the few such cases where
  results have been promising. In particular, peripheral T-lymphocytes-directed gene
  therapy provides further immunological improvements for patients with ADA-SCID receiving
  the PEG-ADA treatment whereas gene therapy targeting haematopoietic stem cell has
  so far proved insufficient for clinical benefits. This report will review crucial
  problems elucidated in the past five clinical trials for ADA-SCID and gives an outline
  of the next generation of stem cell gene therapy in Japan.
