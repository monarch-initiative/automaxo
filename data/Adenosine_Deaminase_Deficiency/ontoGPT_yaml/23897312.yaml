input_text: "Newborn screening for severe combined immunodeficiency: an opportunity
  for intervention.Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is a potentially fatal
  disorder characterized by defective T- and B-lymphocyte function. We describe a
  34-week female twin who had developed feeding intolerance, perioral cyanosis, abdominal
  distension and neutropenia at 1 month of age. Despite several evaluations including
  an 'inconclusive' newborn screening result for SCID, the presence of profound lymphopenia
  was unappreciated. Eventually a diagnosis of SCID in association with adenosine
  deaminase deficiency was made. This case serves to emphasize the importance of newborn
  screening for SCID in the context of careful evaluation of clinical and laboratory
  findings that may be overlooked and result in a delay in the diagnosis of a potentially
  life-threatening condition. "
