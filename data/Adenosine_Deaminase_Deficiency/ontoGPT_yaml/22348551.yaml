input_text: Gene therapy for severe combined immunodeficiency due to adenosine deaminase
  deficiency.The severe combined immunodeficiency caused by the absence of adenosine
  deaminase (SCID-ADA) was the first monogenic disorder for which gene therapy was
  developed. Over 30 patients have been treated worldwide using the current protocols,
  and most of them have experienced clinical benefit; importantly, in the absence
  of any vector-related complications. In this document, we review the progress made
  so far in the development and establishment of gene therapy as an alternative form
  of treatment for ADA-SCID patients.
