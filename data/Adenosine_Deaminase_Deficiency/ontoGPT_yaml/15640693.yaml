input_text: 'Perspectives of gene therapy for primary immunodeficiencies.PURPOSE OF
  REVIEW: Standard therapies for patients with severe primary immunodeficiencies include
  bone marrow transplantation and, for adenosine deaminase deficiency, enzyme replacement.
  In the last decade, gene therapy has been developed as an alternative for these
  conditions. We summarize the recent advances in gene therapy for primary immunodeficiencies
  and discuss the unexpected occurrence of leukemia in a gene therapy trial for X-linked
  severe combined immunodeficiency. RECENT FINDINGS: Eight of 10 infants with X-linked
  severe combined immunodeficiency who received autologous hematopoietic stem cells
  transduced with a retroviral vector carrying the IL2RG complementary DNA achieved
  immune reconstitution. However, the two youngest patients developed leukemic expansions
  of gene-corrected cells. The first case had proliferation of a gamma delta T cell
  clone, and the second case had three alpha beta T cell clones derived from a single
  transduced progenitor. Leukemic cells in both patients aberrantly expressed the
  LIM domain only-2 transcription factor due to retroviral vector insertions in this
  locus. After receiving anti-leukemic treatment one patient achieved a lasting remission,
  but the other relapsed. Four adenosine deaminase deficient severe combined immunodeficiency
  patients also developed functional immunity after receiving autologous hematopoietic
  stem cells transduced with the adenosine deaminase gene complementary DNA following
  submyeloablative chemotherapy. Chronic granulomatous disease, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome,
  JAK3 deficiency and RAG2 deficiency are other immunodeficiencies being studied as
  candidates for gene therapy. SUMMARY: Gene therapy is a promising therapeutic option
  for some primary immunodeficiencies, especially when cells expressing the correct
  gene have a selective advantage. More clinical trials with closer patient monitoring
  are under way to define which patients may benefit from this approach, and strategies
  are being developed to understand and ultimately reduce the risk of leukemia secondary
  to retroviral vector insertion.'
