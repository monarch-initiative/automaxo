input_text: Molecular defects in human severe combined immunodeficiency and approaches
  to immune reconstitution.Mutations in nine different genes have been found to cause
  the human severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome. The products of three of the
  genes--IL-2RG, Jak3, and IL-7R alpha--are components of cytokine receptors, and
  the products of three more-RAG1, RAG2, and Artemis-are essential for effecting antigen
  receptor gene rearrangement. Additionally, a deficiency of CD3 delta, a component
  of the T-cell antigen receptor, results in a near absence of circulating mature
  CD3+ T cells and a complete lack of gamma/delta T cells. Adenosine deaminase deficiency
  results in toxic accumulations of metabolites that cause T cell apoptosis. Finally,
  a deficiency of CD45, a critical regulator of signaling thresholds in immune cells,
  also causes SCID. Approaches to immune reconstitution have included bone marrow
  transplantation and gene therapy. Bone marrow transplantation, both HLA identical
  unfractionated and T cell-depleted HLA haploidentical, has been very successful
  in effecting immune reconstitution if done in the first 3.5 months of life and without
  pretransplant chemotherapy. Gene therapy was highly successful in nine infants with
  X-linked SCID, but the trials have been placed on hold due to the development of
  a leukemic process in two of the children because of insertional oncogenesis.
