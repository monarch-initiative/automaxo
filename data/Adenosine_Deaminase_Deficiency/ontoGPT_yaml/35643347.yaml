input_text: 'Polymer-drug conjugates: Design principles, emerging synthetic strategies
  and clinical overview.Adagen, an enzyme replacement treatment for adenosine deaminase
  deficiency, was the first protein-polymer conjugate to be approved in early 1990
  s. Post this regulatory approval, numerous polymeric drugs and polymeric nanoparticles
  have entered the market as advanced or next-generation polymer-based therapeutics,
  while many others have currently been tested clinically. The polymer conjugation
  to therapeutic moiety offers several advantages, like enhanced solubilization of
  drug, controlled release, reduced immunogenicity, and prolonged circulation. The
  present review intends to highlight considerations in the design of therapeutically
  effective polymer-drug conjugates (PDCs), including the choice of linker chemistry.
  The potential synthetic strategies to formulate PDCs have been discussed along with
  recent advancements in the different types of PDCs, i.e., polymer-small molecular
  weight drug conjugates, polymer-protein conjugates, and stimuli-responsive PDCs,
  which are under clinical/preclinical investigation. Current impediments and regulatory
  hurdles hindering the clinical translation of PDC into effective therapeutic regimens
  for the amelioration of disease conditions have been addressed.'
