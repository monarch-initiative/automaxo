input_text: Nonmyeloablative stem cell transplantation for congenital immunodeficiencies.The
  optimal approach for stem cell transplantation in children with immunodeficiency
  has yet to be determined. Conditioning therapy is necessary for reliable engraftment
  and full immune reconstitution; however, the beneficial effect of cytoreductive
  conditioning is counterbalanced by increased short- and long-term treatment-related
  toxicity. Whether bone marrow transplantation with a nonmyeloablative preparative
  regimen was sufficient for the establishment of donor immune reconstitution, with
  the resultant correction of disease phenotype, was investigated. Eight patients
  with severe immunodeficiency states underwent T-cell replete bone marrow transplantation
  from a human leukocyte antigen-matched unrelated (n = 6) or sibling (n = 2) donor
  with nonmyeloablative conditioning using a fludarabine-melphalan-anti-lymphocyte
  globulin-based regimen. All patients had severe organ dysfunction that precluded
  transplantation with conventional conditioning. All patients were engrafted with
  predominantly donor hematopoiesis, and the duration of neutropenia was brief. Significant
  acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) did not develop, but one patient had limited
  chronic GVHD. One patient died of disease recurrence, and 3 have stable, mixed chimerism.
  At a median follow-up of 1 year, all patients have had good recovery of CD3(+) T-cell
  numbers, and 6 of 7 evaluable patients have normal phytohemagglutinin stimulation
  indices. The rate of immune reconstitution is comparable with that of historical
  controls undergoing standard myeloablative protocols. Two patients with CD40 ligand
  deficiency now show significant expression, and a patient with adenosine deaminase
  deficiency has improved deoxy adenosine triphosphate metabolites. In summary, it
  has been demonstrated that nonmyeloablative stem cell transplantation permits rapid
  engraftment from both sibling and unrelated donors with minimal toxicity even in
  the presence of severe organ dysfunction. If long-term immune reconstitution of
  patients treated with this protocol is demonstrated, it is believed this approach
  might offer significant advantages compared with standard protocols by combining
  adequate immune reconstitution with reduced short- and long-term toxicity. (Blood.
