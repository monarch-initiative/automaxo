input_text: "Production of IL-4 and expression of CD40 ligand by human CD8 T cells.BACKGROUND:
  The role of CD8(+) T cells in IgE synthesis remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: The aim
  of this study was to investigate IL-4 production and CD40 ligand expression by human
  CD8(+) T cells. METHODS: We conducted functional and phenotypic analyses of human
  T cells in peritoneal washings from severe combined immunodeficiency mice reconstituted
  with PBMCs from normal and atopic human donors. We also examined the expression
  of IL-4 and CD40 ligand by CD8(+) T cells from a patient with adenosine deaminase
  deficiency who received autologous T cell-directed gene therapy. RESULTS: Transfer
  of atopic cells into the mice caused production of IgE and IgG with increased expression
  of IL-4 and CD40 ligand mRNA. In addition, both intracellular IL-4 and cell surface
  CD40 ligand were detected in CD8(+) and in CD4(+) T cells. CD8(+) T-cell lines generated
  from the patient's T cells carrying the adenosine deaminase gene expressed not only
  IL-4 mRNA and protein but also CD40 ligand mRNA and protein after being stimulated
  with an anti-CD3 mAb. After anti-CD3 stimulation and paraformaldehyde fixation,
  CD8(+) T cells induced IgE synthesis by normal human B cells in the presence of
  recombinant IL-4. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these results demonstrate that IL-4-producing
  and CD40 ligand-expressing CD8(+) cells are detectable among human T cells and suggest
  that such cells may promote IgE production by B cells under some conditions."
