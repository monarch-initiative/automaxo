input_text: "Newborn screening for SCID in New York State: experience from the first
  two years.PURPOSE: To describe the process and assess outcomes for the first 2 years
  of newborn screening for severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID NBS) in New York
  State (NYS). METHODS: The NYS algorithm utilizes a first-tier molecular screen for
  TRECs (T-cell receptor excision circles), the absence of which is indicative of
  increased risk of immunodeficiency. RESULTS: During the first 2 years, 485,912 infants
  were screened for SCID. Repeat specimens were requested from 561 premature and 746
  non-premature infants with low or borderline TRECs. A total of 531 infants were
  referred for diagnostic evaluation leading to identification of 10 infants with
  SCID and 87 with a clinically significant non-SCID abnormality based on flow cytometry
  or CBC results (positive predictive value 20.3 %). Nine infants were diagnosed with
  typical SCID and one with leaky SCID. SCID diagnoses included two patients with
  adenosine deaminase deficiency, three patients with typical and one with leaky IL2RG-related
  SCID, one patient with IL7Ralpha-related SCID, and three cases of typical SCID,
  etiology unknown. TRECs were undetectable in eight of the nine babies with typical
  SCID. Infants with other non-SCID conditions included 27 patients with a syndrome
  that included T-cell impairment, 18 of which had DiGeorge syndrome. Seventeen infants
  had T-cell impairment secondary to another clinically significant condition, and
  13 were classified as 'other'. Among 30 infants classified as idiopathic T-cell
  lymphopenia, 11 have since resolved, and the remainder continues to be followed.
  One infant with undetectable TRECs had normal follow-up studies. Molecular studies
  revealed the presence of two changes in the infant's DNA. CONCLUSIONS: Overall,
  ten infants with SCID were identified during the first 2 years of screening in NYS,
  yielding an incidence of approximately 1 in 48,500 live births, which is consistent
  with the incidence observed by other states screening for SCID. The incidence of
  any clinically significant laboratory abnormality was approximately 1 in 5,000;
  both estimates are higher than estimates prior to the onset of newborn screening
  for SCID. Improvements to the NYS algorithm included the addition of a borderline
  category that reduced the proportion of infants referred for flow cytometric analysis,
  without decreasing sensitivity. We identified a large number of infants with abnormal
  TRECs and subsequent idiopathic T-cell lymphopenia. Long-term follow-up studies
  are needed to determine the prognosis and optimal treatment for this group of patients,
  some of whom may present with previously unrecognized, transient lymphopenia of
  infancy."
