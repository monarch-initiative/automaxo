input_text: 'Gene Therapy for the Treatment of Primary Immune Deficiencies.The use
  of gene therapy in the treatment of primary immune deficiencies (PID) has advanced
  significantly in the last decade. Clinical trials for X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency,
  adenosine deaminase deficiency (ADA), chronic granulomatous disease, and Wiskott-Aldrich
  syndrome have demonstrated that gene transfer into hematopoietic stem cells and
  autologous transplant can result in clinical improvement and is curative for many
  patients. Unfortunately, early clinical trials were complicated by vector-related
  insertional mutagenic events for several diseases with the exception of ADA-deficiency
  SCID. These results prompted the current wave of clinical trials for primary immunodeficiency
  using alternative retro- or lenti-viral vector constructs that are self-inactivating,
  and they have shown clinical efficacy without leukemic events thus far. The field
  of gene therapy continues to progress, with improvements in viral vector profiles,
  stem cell culturing techniques, and site-specific genome editing platforms. The
  future of gene therapy is promising, and we are quickly moving towards a time when
  it will be a standard cellular therapy for many forms of PID. '
