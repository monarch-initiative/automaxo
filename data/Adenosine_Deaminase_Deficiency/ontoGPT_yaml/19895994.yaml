input_text: 'Outcomes of patients with severe combined immunodeficiency treated with
  hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with and without preconditioning.BACKGROUND:
  The effect of pretransplantation conditioning on the long-term outcomes of patients
  receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for severe combined immunodeficiency
  (SCID) has not been completely determined. OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess the outcomes
  of 23 mostly conditioned patients with SCID and compare their outcomes with those
  of 25 previously reported nonconditioned patients with SCID who underwent transplantation.
  METHODS: In the present study we reviewed the medical records of these 23 consecutive,
  mostly conditioned patients with SCID who underwent transplantation between 1998
  and 2007. RESULTS: Eighteen patients (median age at transplantation, 10 months;
  range, 0.8-108 months) received haploidentical mismatched related donor, matched
  unrelated donor, or mismatched unrelated donor transplants, 17 of whom received
  pretransplantation conditioning (with 1 not conditioned); 13 (72%) patients engrafted
  with donor cells and survive at a median of 3.8 years (range, 1.8-9.8 year); 5 (38%)
  of 13 patients require intravenous immunoglobulin; and 6 of 6 age-eligible children
  attend school. Of 5 recipients (median age at transplantation, 7 months; range,
  2-23 months) of matched related donor transplants, all 5 engrafted and survive at
  a median of 7.5 years (range, 1.5-9.5 year), 1 recipient requires intravenous immunoglobulin,
  and 3 of 3 age-eligible children attend school. Gene mutations were known in 16
  cases: mutation in the common gamma chain of the IL-2 receptor (IL2RG) in 7 patients,
  mutation in the alpha chain of the IL-7 receptor (IL7RA) in 4 patients, mutation
  in the recombinase-activating gene (RAG1) in 2 patients, adenosine deaminase deficiency
  (ADA) in 2 patients, and adenylate kinase 2 (AK2) in 1 patient. Early outcomes and
  quality of life of the previous nonconditioned versus the present conditioned cohorts
  were not statistically different, but longer-term follow-up is necessary for confirmation.
  CONCLUSIONS: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in patients with SCID results
  in engraftment, long-term survival, and a good quality of life for the majority
  of patients with or without pretransplantation conditioning.'
