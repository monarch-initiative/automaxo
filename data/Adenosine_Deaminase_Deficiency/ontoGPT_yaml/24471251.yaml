input_text: 'Human gene therapy: a brief overview of the genetic revolution.Advances
  in biotechnology have brought gene therapy to the forefront of medical research.
  The prelude to successful gene therapy i.e. the efficient transfer and expression
  of a variety of human gene into target cells has already been accomplished in several
  systems. Safe methods have been devised to do this, using several viral and no-viral
  vectors. Two main approaches emerged: in vivo modification and ex vivo modification.
  Retrovirus, adenovirus, adeno-associated virus are suitable for gene therapeutic
  approaches which are based on permanent expression of the therapeutic gene. Non-viral
  vectors are far less efficient than viral vectors, but they have advantages due
  to their low immunogenicity and their large capacity for therapeutic DNA. To improve
  the function of non-viral vectors, the addition of viral functions such as receptor
  mediated uptake and nuclear translocation of DNA may finally lead to the development
  of an artificial virus. Gene transfer protocols have been approved for human use
  in inherited diseases, cancers and acquired disorders. In 1990, the first successful
  clinical trial of gene therapy was initiated for adenosine deaminase deficiency.
  Since then, the number of clinical protocols initiated worldwide has increased exponentially.
  Although preliminary results of these trials are somewhat disappointing, but human
  gene therapy dreams of treating diseases by replacing or supplementing the product
  of defective or introducing novel therapeutic genes. So definitely human gene therapy
  is an effective addition to the arsenal of approaches to many human therapies in
  the 21st century.'
