input_text: 'Gene therapy for PIDs: progress, pitfalls and prospects.Substantial progress
  has been made in the past decade in treating several primary immunodeficiency disorders
  (PIDs) with gene therapy. Current approaches are based on ex-vivo transfer of therapeutic
  transgene via viral vectors to patient-derived autologous hematopoietic stem cells
  (HSCs) followed by transplantation back to the patient with or without conditioning.
  The overall outcome from all the clinical trials targeting different PIDs has been
  extremely encouraging but not without caveats. Malignant outcomes from insertional
  mutagenesis have featured prominently in the adverse events associated with these
  trials and have warranted intense pre-clinical investigation into defining the tendencies
  of different viral vectors for genomic integration. Coupled with issues pertaining
  to transgene expression, the therapeutic landscape has undergone a paradigm shift
  in determining safety, stability and efficacy of gene therapy approaches. In this
  review, we aim to summarize the progress made in the gene therapy trials targeting
  ADA-SCID, SCID-X1, CGD and WAS, review the pitfalls, and outline the recent advancements
  which are expected to further enhance favourable risk benefit ratios for gene therapeutic
  approaches in the future.'
