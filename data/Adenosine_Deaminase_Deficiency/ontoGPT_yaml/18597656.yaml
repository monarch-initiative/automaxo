input_text: 'Towards a rAAV-based gene therapy for ADA-SCID: from ADA deficiency to
  current and future treatment strategies.Adenosine deaminase deficiency fosters a
  rare, devastating pediatric immune deficiency with concomitant opportunistic infections,
  metabolic anomalies and multiple organ system pathology. The standard of care for
  adenosine deaminase deficient severe combined immune deficiency (ADA-SCID) includes
  enzyme replacement therapy or bone marrow transplantation. Gene therapies for ADA-SCID
  over nearly two decades have exclusively involved retroviral vectors targeted to
  lymphocytes and hematopoetic progenitors. These groundbreaking gene therapies represent
  a revolution in clinical medicine, but come with several challenges, including the
  risk of insertional mutagenesis. An alternative gene therapy for ADA-SCID may utilize
  recombinant adeno-associated virus vectors in vivo, with numerous target tissues,
  to foster ectopic expression and secretion of adenosine deaminase. This review endeavors
  to describe ADA-SCID, the traditional treatments, previous retroviral gene therapies,
  and primarily, alternative recombinant adeno-associated virus-based strategies to
  remedy this potentially fatal genetic disease.'
