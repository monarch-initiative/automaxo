input_text: 'Current status of ex vivo gene therapy for hematological disorders: a
  review of clinical trials in Japan around the world.Gene therapies are classified
  into two major categories, namely, in vivo and ex vivo. Clinical trials of human
  gene therapy began with the ex vivo techniques. Based on the initial successes of
  gene-therapy clinical trials, these approaches have spread worldwide. The number
  of gene therapy trials approved worldwide increased gradually starting in 1989,
  reaching 116 protocols per year in 1999, and a total of 2210 protocols had been
  approved by 2015. Accumulating clinical evidence has demonstrated the safety and
  benefits of several types of gene therapy, with the exception of serious adverse
  events in several clinical trials. These painful experiences were translated backward
  to basic science, resulting in the development of several new technologies that
  have influenced the recent development of ex vivo gene therapy in this field. To
  date, six gene therapies have been approved in a limited number of countries worldwide.
  In Japan, clinical trials of gene therapy have developed under the strong influence
  of trials in the US and Europe. Since the initial stages, 50 clinical trials have
  been approved by the Japanese government. In this review, the history and current
  status of clinical trials of ex vivo gene therapy for hematological disorders are
  introduced and discussed. '
