input_text: Severe combined immunodeficiency due to adenosine deaminase deficiency.Severe
  Combined Immunodeficiency is the term applied to a group of rare genetic disorders
  characterised by defective or absent T and B cell functions. Patients usually present
  in first 6 months of life with respiratory/gastrointestinal tract infections and
  failure to thrive. Among the various types of severe combined immunodeficiency,
  enzyme deficiencies are relatively less common. We report the case of a 6 years
  old girl having severe combined immunodeficiency due to adenosine deaminase deficiency.
