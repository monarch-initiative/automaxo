input_text: Consensus approach for the management of severe combined immune deficiency
  caused by adenosine deaminase deficiency.Inherited defects in adenosine deaminase
  (ADA) cause a subtype of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) known as severe
  combined immune deficiency caused by adenosine deaminase defects (ADA-SCID). Most
  affected infants can receive a diagnosis while still asymptomatic by using an SCID
  newborn screening test, allowing early initiation of therapy. We review the evidence
  currently available and propose a consensus management strategy. In addition to
  treatment of the immune deficiency seen in patients with ADA-SCID, patients should
  be followed for specific noninfectious respiratory, neurological, and biochemical
  complications associated with ADA deficiency. All patients should initially receive
  enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), followed by definitive treatment with either of
  2 equal first-line options. If an HLA-matched sibling donor or HLA-matched family
  donor is available, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) should
  be pursued. The excellent safety and efficacy observed in more than 100 patients
  with ADA-SCID who received gammaretrovirus- or lentivirus-mediated autologous hematopoietic
  stem cell gene therapy (HSC-GT) since 2000 now positions HSC-GT as an equal alternative.
  If HLA-matched sibling donor/HLA-matched family donor HSCT or HSC-GT are not available
  or have failed, ERT can be continued or reinstituted, and HSCT with alternative
  donors should be considered. The outcomes of novel HSCT, ERT, and HSC-GT strategies
  should be evaluated prospectively in "real-life" conditions to further inform these
  management guidelines.
