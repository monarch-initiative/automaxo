input_text: 'Genotoxicity of retroviral hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy.INTRODUCTION:
  Retroviral vectors have been developed for hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene therapy
  and have successfully cured X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID-X1),
  adenosine deaminase deficiency (ADA-SCID), adrenoleukodystrophy, and Wiskott-Aldrich
  syndrome. However, in HSC gene therapy clinical trials, genotoxicity mediated by
  integrated vector proviruses has led to clonal expansion, and in some cases frank
  leukemia. Numerous studies have been performed to understand the molecular basis
  of vector-mediated genotoxicity with the aim of developing safer vectors and safer
  gene therapy protocols. These genotoxicity studies are critical to advancing HSC
  gene therapy. AREAS COVERED: This review provides an introduction to the mechanisms
  of retroviral vector genotoxicity. It also covers advances over the last 20 years
  in designing safer gene therapy vectors, and in integration site analysis in clinical
  trials and large animal models. Mechanisms of retroviral-mediated genotoxicity,
  and the risk factors that contribute to clonal expansion and leukemia in HSC gene
  therapy are introduced. EXPERT OPINION: Continued research on virus-host interactions
  and next-generation vectors should further improve the safety of future HSC gene
  therapy vectors and protocols.'
