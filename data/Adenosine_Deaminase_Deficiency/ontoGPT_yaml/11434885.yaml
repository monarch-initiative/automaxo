input_text: "[Substitution therapy with hematopoietic progenitors in the primary immunodeficiencies].Hematopoietic
  stem-cell transplantation is currently the most appropriate substitution therapy
  in the most severe forms of primary immunodeficiency diseases (all the variants
  of SCID, WA, CID etc.). It can achieve total and permanent immunological reconstitution
  in 60% of patients, depending on histocompatibility, source of the hematopoietic
  stem cells and the underlying disease. Stem-cell sources may be bone marrow, umbilical
  cord blood and the peripheral blood of donors previously treated with colony stimulating
  factors for the mobilization CD34. We discuss the differences in the results obtained
  in patients treated at the Hospital Materno-Infantil Vall d'Hebron. Gene therapy
  opens a new era in the treatment of primary immunodeficiency diseases. The first
  patient to undergo this treatment in the United States of America had adenosine-deaminase
  deficiency, even though sustained remodeling has not been achieved. The favorable
  results obtained in patients with SCID by deficit in the gamma chain of the IL-2
  receptor in Paris, with more than a year of follow up, suggest that the near future
  is promising. We also discuss the differences observed according to the vectors
  used and the underlying disease."
