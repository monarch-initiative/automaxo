input_text: 'Gene therapy in The Netherlands: highlights from the Low Countries.Gene
  therapy is an active research area in The Netherlands and Dutch scientists involved
  in fundamental and clinical gene therapy research significantly contribute to the
  progresses made in this field. This ranges from the establishment of the 293, 911
  and PER.C6 cell lines, which are used worldwide for the production of replication-defective
  adenoviral vectors, to the development of targeted viral vectors and T lymphocytes
  as well as of non-viral vectors. Several milestones have been achieved in Dutch
  clinical gene therapy trials, including the first treatment worldwide of patients
  with adenosine deaminase deficiency with genetically corrected hematopoietic stem
  cells in collaboration with French and British scientists. Until now, about 230
  patients with various diseases have been treated with viral and non-viral gene therapy
  in this country. Ongoing and upcoming Dutch clinical trials focus on the translation
  of new developments in gene therapy research, including the restoration of genetic
  defects other than SCID, and the use of oncolytic adenoviruses and targeted T cells
  for the treatment of cancer. The growing commercial interest in Dutch clinical gene
  therapy is reflected by the involvement of two Dutch companies in ongoing trials
  as well as the participation of Dutch clinical centres in large phase III international
  multicenter immuno-gene therapy trials on prostate cancer sponsored by an American
  company. Translational gene therapy research in The Netherlands is boosted at a
  governmental level by the Dutch Ministry of Health via a dedicated funding programme.
  This paper presents an overview on milestones in Dutch basic gene therapy research
  as well as on past, present and future clinical gene therapy trials in The Netherlands.'
