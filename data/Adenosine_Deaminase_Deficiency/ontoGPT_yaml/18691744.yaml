input_text: Disease-specific induced pluripotent stem cells.Tissue culture of immortal
  cell strains from diseased patients is an invaluable resource for medical research
  but is largely limited to tumor cell lines or transformed derivatives of native
  tissues. Here we describe the generation of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells
  from patients with a variety of genetic diseases with either Mendelian or complex
  inheritance; these diseases include adenosine deaminase deficiency-related severe
  combined immunodeficiency (ADA-SCID), Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome (SBDS),
  Gaucher disease (GD) type III, Duchenne (DMD) and Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD),
  Parkinson disease (PD), Huntington disease (HD), juvenile-onset, type 1 diabetes
  mellitus (JDM), Down syndrome (DS)/trisomy 21, and the carrier state of Lesch-Nyhan
  syndrome. Such disease-specific stem cells offer an unprecedented opportunity to
  recapitulate both normal and pathologic human tissue formation in vitro, thereby
  enabling disease investigation and drug development.
