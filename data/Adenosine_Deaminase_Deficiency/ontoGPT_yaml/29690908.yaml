input_text: 'Adenosine deaminase deficiency: a review.Adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency
  leads to an accumulation of toxic purine degradation by-products, most potently
  affecting lymphocytes, leading to adenosine deaminase-deficient severe combined
  immunodeficiency. Whilst most notable affects are on lymphocytes, other manifestations
  include skeletal abnormalities, neurodevelopmental affects and pulmonary manifestations
  associated with pulmonary-alveolar proteinosis. Affected patients present in early
  infancy, usually with persistent infection, or with pulmonary insufficiency. Three
  treatment options are currently available. Initial treatment with enzyme replacement
  therapy may alleviate acute symptoms and enable partial immunological reconstitution,
  but treatment is life-long, immune reconstitution is incomplete, and the reconstituted
  immune system may nullify the effects of the enzyme replacement. Hematopoietic stem
  cell transplant has long been established as the treatment of choice, particularly
  where a matched sibling or well matched unrelated donor is available. More recently,
  the use of gene addition techniques to correct the genetic defect in autologous
  haematopoietic stem cells treatment has demonstrated immunological and clinical
  efficacy. This article reviews the biology, clinical presentation, diagnosis and
  treatment of ADA-deficiency.'
