input_text: Engraftment and chimerism, particularly of T- and B-cells, in children
  undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.The spectrum of pediatric bone
  marrow transplantation has changed in recent years. Mismatched and unrelated donor
  transplants are common, demanding an increased vigilance to detect incipient graft
  failure, secondary lymphoma as well as relapse and other problems, which now are
  potentially treatable. To diagnose these complications it may be important to know
  whether blood and marrow cells are of recipient or donor origin. To evaluate the
  role of mixed donor-recipient chimerism in relation to clinical problems we adapted
  a polymerase chain-reaction technique, using fluorescent primers analyzing DNA fragment
  length polymorphisms, to follow prospectively 17 bone marrow grafted children. To
  increase the precision of chimerism analysis, immunomagnetically isolated leukocyte
  populations were assayed in selected cases. Five patients encountered clinical problems
  related to chimerism. One infant with adenosine deaminase deficiency failed to engraft
  stem cells, yet succumbed to graft-versus-host disease, mediated by mature donor
  T-cells. Three children developed significant mixed chimerism. One of these three
  patients died in relapse of leukemia, while the two other patients who had received
  T-cell depleted grafts had persistent recipient T-cells, in spite of engraftment.
  After 5 months, these were displaced by donor T-cells in one of the patients. In
  the fifth patient, also after T-cell depleted BMT, a fatal donor cell lymphoma occurred.
  Twelve children had stable full chimerism or in one case a low grade mixed chimerism
  and remain disease-free throughout follow up (median 9 months). In conclusion, the
  analysis of chimerism, particularly of separated leukocyte populations, offers an
  almost indispensable insight and a basis for therapeutic decisions in complicated
  situations such as grafting involving unrelated or mismatched donors, graft manipulation,
  adoptive immunotherapy and in immunodeficiency patients.
