input_text: Successful bone marrow transplantation with reduced intensity conditioning
  in a patient with delayed-onset adenosine deaminase deficiency.In this case report,
  we describe successful BMT with RIC in a patient with delayed-onset ADA deficiency.
  A three-yr-old Japanese boy was diagnosed with delayed-onset ADA deficiency because
  of recurrent bronchitis, bronchiectasia, and lymphopenia. In addition, autoimmune
  thyroiditis and neutropenia were present. At four yr of age, he underwent BMT with
  a RIC regimen, including busulfan and fludarabine, from an HLA-identical healthy
  sister. Engraftment after BMT was uneventful without GVHD. Decreased ADA levels
  in blood immediately increased following BMT, and the patient was disease-free 13
  months after BMT. These results suggest that BMT with RIC may sufficiently restore
  immune regulation in delayed-onset ADA deficiency. A longer follow-up period is
  needed to confirm these observations.
