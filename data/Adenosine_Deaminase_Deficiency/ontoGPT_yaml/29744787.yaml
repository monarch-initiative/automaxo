input_text: 'ADA Deficiency: Evaluation of the Clinical and Laboratory Features and
  the Outcome.INTRODUCTION: Adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency is an autosomal recessive
  primary immunodeficiency. It results in the intracellular accumulation of toxic
  metabolites which have effects particularly on lymphocytes and the brain. The aim
  of this study was to evaluate the outcome of 13 ADA-deficient patients. We planned
  to evaluate their clinical and laboratory findings before and after enzyme replacement
  therapy (ERT), allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (aHSCT), and hematopoietic
  stem cell gene therapy (HSCGT). METHODS: Measurement of ADA enzyme activity and
  metabolites and sequencing of the ADA gene were performed in most of the patients
  with ADA deficiency. One of the patients with late-onset ADA deficiency was diagnosed
  by the help of primary immunodeficiency panel screening. RESULTS: Ten out of 13
  patients were diagnosed as SCID, while 3 out of 13 were diagnosed as delayed-/late-onset
  ADA deficiency. Late-onset ADA deficiency patients had clinical and laboratory findings
  of combined immunodeficiency (CID). Eight patients with ADA-SCID were found to have
  higher levels of ADA metabolite (dAXP%) (62.1% (34.6-71.9)) than 3 patients with
  delayed-/late-onset ADA deficiency (6.9% (2.1-8.9). All but one patient with SCID
  had T-B-NK- phenotype, one had T-B-NK+ phenotype. Genetic defect was documented
  in 11 patients. Four out of 11 patients had compound heterozygous defects. Three
  out of 4 patients with compound heterozygous defects had delayed-onset/late-onset
  ADA deficiency. Seven out of 11 patients with SCID had homozygous defects. Five
  out of 7 had the same homozygous indel frameshift mutation (c.955-959delGAAGA) showing
  a founder effect. There were two novel splice site defects: one (IVS10+2T>C) was
  heterozygous in a patient with late-onset ADA deficiency, and the other was homozygous
  (IVS2delT+2) in a SCID patient. Other defects were missense defects. Nine out of
  13 patients were put on pegylated ADA ERT. Four out of six patients were transplanted
  without using a conditioning regimen. HSCGT was performed to one of the patients.
  CONCLUSION: The genetic diagnosis of SCID is utmost important. There is a chance
  to give ERT before the definitive therapy if the patient with SCID/CID has ADA deficiency.
  Although ERT was insufficient to restore a normal immune function in ADA-SCID patients,
  it was useful to improve and stabilize the clinical status before curative therapy
  (aHSCT/HSCGT). Enzyme replacement therapy was successful in patients with late-/delayed-onset
  ADA deficiency who presented with the features of combined immunodeficiency. Gastrointestinal
  polyposis in a patient with late-onset ADA deficiency may be an association or a
  coincidental finding. Intermittent neurodevelopmental evaluation especially for
  hearing impairment should be performed in most of the ADA-deficient patients. This
  may alleviate the speech delay and cognitive abnormalities which may be observed
  in the follow-up.'
