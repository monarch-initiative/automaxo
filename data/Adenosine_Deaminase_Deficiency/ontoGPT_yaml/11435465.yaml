input_text: Adenosine deaminase deficiency increases thymic apoptosis and causes defective
  T cell receptor signaling.Adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency in humans results
  in a severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). This immunodeficiency is associated
  with severe disturbances in purine metabolism that are thought to mediate lymphotoxicity.
  The recent generation of ADA-deficient (ADA(-/-)) mice has enabled the in vivo examination
  of mechanisms that may underlie the SCID resulting from ADA deficiency. We demonstrate
  severe depletion of T and B lymphocytes and defects in T and B cell development
  in ADA(-/-) mice. T cell apoptosis was abundant in thymi of ADA(-/-) mice, but no
  increase in apoptosis was detected in the spleen and lymph nodes of these animals,
  suggesting that the defect is specific to developing thymocytes. Studies of mature
  T cells recovered from spleens of ADA(-/-) mice revealed that ADA deficiency is
  accompanied by TCR activation defects of T cells in vivo. Furthermore, ex vivo experiments
  on ADA(-/-) T cells demonstrated that elevated adenosine is responsible for this
  abnormal TCR signaling. These findings suggest that the metabolic disturbances seen
  in ADA(-/-) mice affect various signaling pathways that regulate thymocyte survival
  and function. Experiments with thymocytes ex vivo confirmed that ADA deficiency
  reduces tyrosine phosphorylation of TCR-associated signaling molecules and blocks
  TCR-triggered calcium increases.
