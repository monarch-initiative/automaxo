                    "text": "Gene therapy of genetic diseases and cancer.The scope of gene transfer applications in human therapy has expanded enormously over the last 15 years to include not only several types of genetic diseases but also a variety of genetic approaches to the treatment of cancer. Hematopoietic stem cells have been considered excellent targets for therapeutic gene transfer because of their capacity for self-renewal and for differentiation into multiple cellular lineages. Retrovirus-mediated gene transfer has been tested for treatment of diseases that specifically affect the hematopoietic system, such as adenosine deaminase deficiency and chronic granulomatous disease. Storage disorders such as Gaucher disease, Hurler syndrome and Hunter syndrome, genetic deficiencies that affect a broad range of tissue types, may also be amenable to treatment by gene transfer into hematopoietic cells, owing to the release of enzyme expressed in transduced cells with subsequent uptake by untransduced cells (\"metabolic cross-correction\"). Hematopoietic stem cells may also be targeted for introduction of drug-resistance genes for the purpose of protecting normal tissues from the toxic side-effects of cancer chemotherapeutic agents, thus allowing more effective antitumor chemotherapy. The danger of introducing drug-resistance function into tumor cells may be dealt with by including sequences specifically designed to reduce expression of oncogenes or to restore expression of tumor suppressor genes. Current limitations on the efficiency of gene transfer into hematopoietic stem cells may be alleviated by the development of new vector systems such as adeno-associated virus or lentivirus vectors, or by advances in cell processing that render hematopoietic cells more susceptible to transduction. Drug-resistance genes may also be applied for in vivo selection to expand the representation of a small proportion of transduced hematopoietic cells. These approaches toward increasing the frequency of hematopoietic cell transduction contribute to the anticipated feasibility of gene therapy for genetic diseases and cancer.",

This ranges from the establishment of the 293, 911 and PER.C6 cell lines, which are used worldwide for the production of replication-defective adenoviral vectors, to the development of targeted viral vectors and T lymphocytes as well as of non-viral vectors. Several milestones have been achieved in Dutch clinical gene therapy trials, including the first treatment worldwide of patients with adenosine deaminase deficiency with genetically corrected hematopoietic stem cells in collaboration with French and British scientists. Until now, about 230 patients with various diseases have been treated with viral and non-viral gene therapy in this country. Ongoing and upcoming Dutch clinical trials focus on the translation of new developments in gene therapy research, including the restoration of genetic defects other than SCID, and the use of oncolytic adenoviruses and targeted T cells for the treatment of cancer. The growing commercial interest in Dutch clinical gene therapy is reflected by the involvement of two Dutch companies in ongoing trials as well as the participation of Dutch clinical centres in large phase III international multicenter immuno-gene therapy trials on prostate cancer sponsored by an American company. Translational gene therapy research in The Netherlands is boosted at a governmental level by the Dutch Ministry of Health via a dedicated funding programme. This paper presents an overview on milestones in Dutch basic gene therapy research as well as on past, present and future clinical gene therapy trials in The Netherlands.",

However, recent disappointing results of the considerable clinical trials have also clearly demonstrated that such an initial expectation was an overestimation of gene therapy. There are only a few successful cases despite the 3000 patients who have been treated with various forms of gene therapy. Gene therapy for severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) caused by adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency is one of the few such cases where results have been promising. In particular, peripheral T-lymphocytes-directed gene therapy provides further immunological improvements for patients with ADA-SCID receiving the PEG-ADA treatment whereas gene therapy targeting haematopoietic stem cell has so far proved insufficient for clinical benefits. This report will review crucial problems elucidated in the past five clinical trials for ADA-SCID and gives an outline of the next generation of stem cell gene therapy in Japan.",

An immune-mediated mechanism may play a role in this disease, although its precise pathogenesis remains unclear. In this study, a 2-year-old boy presented with ADEM, and he showed improvement on treatment with high-dose intravenous corticosteroids. At the age of 3 years, the presence of recurrent bronchitis, bronchiectasia, and lymphopenia suggested that the patient was suffering from combined immunodeficiency. The patient was finally diagnosed with delayed onset adenosine deaminase deficiency. Delayed onset adenosine deaminase deficiency is frequently associated with autoimmune diseases, including thyroiditis and cytopenia, both of which were observed in the patient.

The objective of this study was to document the incidence and type of SCID in Australia, the age and clinical features at presentation and short-term management. The Australian Paediatric Surveillance Unit conducts active, monthly, national surveillance of rare disorders with reporting by child-health specialists. Between May 1995 and December 2001, clinicians provided clinical and laboratory data on children newly diagnosed with SCID. Thirty-three incident cases of SCID were identified [incidence 1.8/10(5) live births per annum; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-2.5]. Twenty-six children had classical SCID (1.45/10(5) live births; 95% CI, 0.9-2.0) and 20 (77%) of these were boys. Classical SCID was X-linked in 13 children, autosomal recessive (AR), not further classified in four, and attributed to adenosine deaminase deficiency (ADA) in four, interleukin-7 receptor alpha chain deficiency in one, Ommen syndrome in two, and Di George syndrome in two. Twenty-one (81%) received bone marrow/stem cell transplantation, three of whom died between 1 and 4 months after transplantation (two ADA deficient, one AR). Seven children had atypical SCID, five of whom died within 1-4 yr of diagnosis. Most children with SCID presented with failure to thrive and recurrent infections and there was no significant delay between presentation and diagnosis. The reported national incidence of classical SCID in Australia (1.45/10(5) or approximately 4 cases per year or 1/69,000 live births) is consistent with the rate (1.4/10(5)) previously reported in Victoria. Diagnosis is rarely delayed, and transplantation is associated with good short-term survival.",

The objective of this study was to document the incidence and type of SCID in Australia, the age and clinical features at presentation and short-term management. The Australian Paediatric Surveillance Unit conducts active, monthly, national surveillance of rare disorders with reporting by child-health specialists. Between May 1995 and December 2001, clinicians provided clinical and laboratory data on children newly diagnosed with SCID. Thirty-three incident cases of SCID were identified [incidence 1.8/10(5) live births per annum; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-2.5]. Twenty-six children had classical SCID (1.45/10(5) live births; 95% CI, 0.9-2.0) and 20 (77%) of these were boys. Classical SCID was X-linked in 13 children, autosomal recessive (AR), not further classified in four, and attributed to adenosine deaminase deficiency (ADA) in four, interleukin-7 receptor alpha chain deficiency in one, Ommen syndrome in two, and Di George syndrome in two. Twenty-one (81%) received bone marrow/stem cell transplantation, three of whom died between 1 and 4 months after transplantation (two ADA deficient, one AR). Seven children had atypical SCID, five of whom died within 1-4 yr of diagnosis. Most children with SCID presented with failure to thrive and recurrent infections and there was no significant delay between presentation and diagnosis. The reported national incidence of classical SCID in Australia (1.45/10(5) or approximately 4 cases per year or 1/69,000 live births) is consistent with the rate (1.4/10(5)) previously reported in Victoria. Diagnosis is rarely delayed, and transplantation is associated with good short-term survival.",

Patients with various conditions lacking a suitable donor have been treated with retroviral vectors and a gene-addition strategy. Initial promising results were shadowed by the occurrence of malignancies in some of these patients. Current trials, developed in the last decade, use safer viral vectors to overcome the risk of genotoxicity and have led to improved clinical outcomes. This review reflects the progresses made in specific disorders, including adenosine deaminase deficiency, X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency, chronic granulomatous disease, and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.",

Patients with various conditions lacking a suitable donor have been treated with retroviral vectors and a gene-addition strategy. Initial promising results were shadowed by the occurrence of malignancies in some of these patients. Current trials, developed in the last decade, use safer viral vectors to overcome the risk of genotoxicity and have led to improved clinical outcomes. This review reflects the progresses made in specific disorders, including adenosine deaminase deficiency, X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency, chronic granulomatous disease, and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.",

In all other settings [X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (X-SCID), adenosine deaminase deficiency, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, and beta-hemoglobinopathies], the bone marrow content of the different stem and precursor cells and the cells' relationship with the stroma have very specific characteristics. These peculiarities can influence the cells' harvesting and behavior in culture, and the postgraft uptake and further behavior of the gene-modified hematopoietic/precursor cells. In the present mini-review, we shall briefly summarize these characteristics and outline the possible consequences and challenges.",

This review describes the latest advances in gene therapy trials for this condition using peripheral blood lymphocytes or hematopoietic progenitors. RECENT FINDINGS: In the first patients with severe combined immunodeficiency due to adenosine deaminase deficiency treated with peripheral blood lymphocytes, transduced T cells have been shown to persist for over 10 years, expressing transgenic adenosine deaminase, but the therapeutic effect of gene therapy remained difficult to assess because of the concomitant treatment with bovine adenosine deaminase conjugated to polyethylene-glycol (PEG-ADA). A recent report showed that discontinuation of PEG-ADA resulted in a strong selective advantage of gene corrected T cells associated with restoration of T cell functions and antibody responses to neoantigen, but incomplete correction of the metabolic defect. Follow-up studies in patients treated with engineered hematopoietic progenitors in the early trials revealed low marking levels of long-term living progenitors and limited clinical effect. Recently, an improved gene transfer protocol in bone marrow CD34+ cells combined with low-dose busulfan resulted in multilineage, stable engraftment of transduced progenitors at substantial levels, restoration of immune functions, correction of the adenosine deaminase metabolic defect, and proven clinical benefit, in the absence of PEG-ADA. Overall, no adverse effect or toxicity has been observed in patients treated with adenosine deaminase gene transfer in mature lymphocytes or hematopoietic progenitors.

SUMMARY: Gene transfer in hematopoietic stem cells combined with nonmyeloablative conditioning is efficacious and might be extended to the treatment of other inherited and acquired disorders of the hematopoietic system.",

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate IL-4 production and CD40 ligand expression by human CD8(+) T cells. METHODS: We conducted functional and phenotypic analyses of human T cells in peritoneal washings from severe combined immunodeficiency mice reconstituted with PBMCs from normal and atopic human donors. We also examined the expression of IL-4 and CD40 ligand by CD8(+) T cells from a patient with adenosine deaminase deficiency who received autologous T cell-directed gene therapy. RESULTS: Transfer of atopic cells into the mice caused production of IgE and IgG with increased expression of IL-4 and CD40 ligand mRNA. In addition, both intracellular IL-4 and cell surface CD40 ligand were detected in CD8(+) and in CD4(+) T cells. CD8(+) T-cell lines generated from the patient's T cells carrying the adenosine deaminase gene expressed not only IL-4 mRNA and protein but also CD40 ligand mRNA and protein after being stimulated with an anti-CD3 mAb. After anti-CD3 stimulation and paraformaldehyde fixation, CD8(+) T cells induced IgE synthesis by normal human B cells in the presence of recombinant IL-4. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these results demonstrate that IL-4-producing and CD40 ligand-expressing CD8(+) cells are detectable among human T cells and suggest that such cells may promote IgE production by B cells under some conditions.",

In the last decade, gene therapy has been developed as an alternative for these conditions. We summarize the recent advances in gene therapy for primary immunodeficiencies and discuss the unexpected occurrence of leukemia in a gene therapy trial for X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency. RECENT FINDINGS: Eight of 10 infants with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency who received autologous hematopoietic stem cells transduced with a retroviral vector carrying the IL2RG complementary DNA achieved immune reconstitution. However, the two youngest patients developed leukemic expansions of gene-corrected cells. The first case had proliferation of a gamma delta T cell clone, and the second case had three alpha beta T cell clones derived from a single transduced progenitor. Leukemic cells in both patients aberrantly expressed the LIM domain only-2 transcription factor due to retroviral vector insertions in this locus. After receiving anti-leukemic treatment one patient achieved a lasting remission, but the other relapsed. Four adenosine deaminase deficient severe combined immunodeficiency patients also developed functional immunity after receiving autologous hematopoietic stem cells transduced with the adenosine deaminase gene complementary DNA following submyeloablative chemotherapy. Chronic granulomatous disease, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, JAK3 deficiency and RAG2 deficiency are other immunodeficiencies being studied as candidates for gene therapy. SUMMARY: Gene therapy is a promising therapeutic option for some primary immunodeficiencies, especially when cells expressing the correct gene have a selective advantage. More clinical trials with closer patient monitoring are under way to define which patients may benefit from this approach, and strategies are being developed to understand and ultimately reduce the risk of leukemia secondary to retroviral vector insertion.",

In the last decade, gene therapy has been developed as an alternative for these conditions. We summarize the recent advances in gene therapy for primary immunodeficiencies and discuss the unexpected occurrence of leukemia in a gene therapy trial for X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency. RECENT FINDINGS: Eight of 10 infants with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency who received autologous hematopoietic stem cells transduced with a retroviral vector carrying the IL2RG complementary DNA achieved immune reconstitution. However, the two youngest patients developed leukemic expansions of gene-corrected cells. The first case had proliferation of a gamma delta T cell clone, and the second case had three alpha beta T cell clones derived from a single transduced progenitor. Leukemic cells in both patients aberrantly expressed the LIM domain only-2 transcription factor due to retroviral vector insertions in this locus. After receiving anti-leukemic treatment one patient achieved a lasting remission, but the other relapsed. Four adenosine deaminase deficient severe combined immunodeficiency patients also developed functional immunity after receiving autologous hematopoietic stem cells transduced with the adenosine deaminase gene complementary DNA following submyeloablative chemotherapy. Chronic granulomatous disease, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, JAK3 deficiency and RAG2 deficiency are other immunodeficiencies being studied as candidates for gene therapy. SUMMARY: Gene therapy is a promising therapeutic option for some primary immunodeficiencies, especially when cells expressing the correct gene have a selective advantage.

METHODS: We treated 50 patients with ADA-SCID (30 in the United States and 20 in the United Kingdom) with an investigational gene therapy composed of autologous CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) transduced ex vivo with a self-inactivating lentiviral vector encoding human ADA. Data from the two U.S. studies (in which fresh and cryopreserved formulations were used) at 24 months of follow-up were analyzed alongside data from the U.K. study (in which a fresh formulation was used) at 36 months of follow-up. RESULTS: Overall survival was 100% in all studies up to 24 and 36 months. Event-free survival (in the absence of reinitiation of enzyme-replacement therapy or rescue allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation) was 97% (U.S. studies) and 100% (U.K. study) at 12 months; 97% and 95%, respectively, at 24 months; and 95% (U.K. study) at 36 months. Engraftment of genetically modified HSPCs persisted in 29 of 30 patients in the U.S. studies and in 19 of 20 patients in the U.K. study. Patients had sustained metabolic detoxification and normalization of ADA activity levels. Immune reconstitution was robust, with 90% of the patients in the U.S. studies and 100% of those in the U.K. study discontinuing immunoglobulin-replacement therapy by 24 months and 36 months, respectively. No evidence of monoclonal expansion, leukoproliferative complications, or emergence of replication-competent lentivirus was noted, and no events of autoimmunity or graft-versus-host disease occurred. Most adverse events were of low grade. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of ADA-SCID with ex vivo lentiviral HSPC gene therapy resulted in high overall and event-free survival with sustained ADA expression, metabolic correction, and functional immune reconstitution.

                    "text": "Autologous Ex Vivo Lentiviral Gene Therapy for Adenosine Deaminase Deficiency.BACKGROUND: Severe combined immunodeficiency due to adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency (ADA-SCID) is a rare and life-threatening primary immunodeficiency. METHODS: We treated 50 patients with ADA-SCID (30 in the United States and 20 in the United Kingdom) with an investigational gene therapy composed of autologous CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) transduced ex vivo with a self-inactivating lentiviral vector encoding human ADA. Data from the two U.S. studies (in which fresh and cryopreserved formulations were used) at 24 months of follow-up were analyzed alongside data from the U.K. study (in which a fresh formulation was used) at 36 months of follow-up. RESULTS: Overall survival was 100% in all studies up to 24 and 36 months. Event-free survival (in the absence of reinitiation of enzyme-replacement therapy or rescue allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation) was 97% (U.S. studies) and 100% (U.K. study) at 12 months; 97% and 95%, respectively, at 24 months; and 95% (U.K. study) at 36 months. Engraftment of genetically modified HSPCs persisted in 29 of 30 patients in the U.S. studies and in 19 of 20 patients in the U.K. study. Patients had sustained metabolic detoxification and normalization of ADA activity levels. Immune reconstitution was robust, with 90% of the patients in the U.S. studies and 100% of those in the U.K. study discontinuing immunoglobulin-replacement therapy by 24 months and 36 months, respectively. No evidence of monoclonal expansion, leukoproliferative complications, or emergence of replication-competent lentivirus was noted, and no events of autoimmunity or graft-versus-host disease occurred. Most adverse events were of low grade. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of ADA-SCID with ex vivo lentiviral HSPC gene therapy resulted in high overall and event-free survival with sustained ADA expression, metabolic correction, and functional immune reconstitution.

It results in the intracellular accumulation of toxic metabolites which have effects particularly on lymphocytes and the brain. The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcome of 13 ADA-deficient patients. We planned to evaluate their clinical and laboratory findings before and after enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (aHSCT), and hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy (HSCGT). METHODS: Measurement of ADA enzyme activity and metabolites and sequencing of the ADA gene were performed in most of the patients with ADA deficiency. One of the patients with late-onset ADA deficiency was diagnosed by the help of primary immunodeficiency panel screening. RESULTS: Ten out of 13 patients were diagnosed as SCID, while 3 out of 13 were diagnosed as delayed-/late-onset ADA deficiency. Late-onset ADA deficiency patients had clinical and laboratory findings of combined immunodeficiency (CID). Eight patients with ADA-SCID were found to have higher levels of ADA metabolite (dAXP%) (62.1% (34.6-71.9)) than 3 patients with delayed-/late-onset ADA deficiency (6.9% (2.1-8.9). All but one patient with SCID had T-B-NK- phenotype, one had T-B-NK+ phenotype. Genetic defect was documented in 11 patients. Four out of 11 patients had compound heterozygous defects. Three out of 4 patients with compound heterozygous defects had delayed-onset/late-onset ADA deficiency. Seven out of 11 patients with SCID had homozygous defects. Five out of 7 had the same homozygous indel frameshift mutation (c.955-959delGAAGA) showing a founder effect. There were two novel splice site defects: one (IVS10+2T>C) was heterozygous in a patient with late-onset ADA deficiency, and the other was homozygous (IVS2delT+2) in a SCID patient. Other defects were missense defects. Nine out of 13 patients were put on pegylated ADA ERT. Four out of six patients were transplanted without using a conditioning regimen. HSCGT was performed to one of the patients. CONCLUSION: The genetic diagnosis of SCID is utmost important. There is a chance to give ERT before the definitive therapy if the patient with SCID/CID has ADA deficiency. Although ERT was insufficient to restore a normal immune function in ADA-SCID patients, it was useful to improve and stabilize the clinical status before curative therapy (aHSCT/HSCGT). Enzyme replacement therapy was successful in patients with late-/delayed-onset ADA deficiency who presented with the features of combined immunodeficiency. Gastrointestinal polyposis in a patient with late-onset ADA deficiency may be an association or a coincidental finding. Intermittent neurodevelopmental evaluation especially for hearing impairment should be performed in most of the ADA-deficient patients. This may alleviate the speech delay and cognitive abnormalities which may be observed in the follow-up.",

It results in the intracellular accumulation of toxic metabolites which have effects particularly on lymphocytes and the brain. The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcome of 13 ADA-deficient patients. We planned to evaluate their clinical and laboratory findings before and after enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (aHSCT), and hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy (HSCGT). METHODS: Measurement of ADA enzyme activity and metabolites and sequencing of the ADA gene were performed in most of the patients with ADA deficiency. One of the patients with late-onset ADA deficiency was diagnosed by the help of primary immunodeficiency panel screening. RESULTS: Ten out of 13 patients were diagnosed as SCID, while 3 out of 13 were diagnosed as delayed-/late-onset ADA deficiency. Late-onset ADA deficiency patients had clinical and laboratory findings of combined immunodeficiency (CID). Eight patients with ADA-SCID were found to have higher levels of ADA metabolite (dAXP%) (62.1% (34.6-71.9)) than 3 patients with delayed-/late-onset ADA deficiency (6.9% (2.1-8.9). All but one patient with SCID had T-B-NK- phenotype, one had T-B-NK+ phenotype. Genetic defect was documented in 11 patients. Four out of 11 patients had compound heterozygous defects. Three out of 4 patients with compound heterozygous defects had delayed-onset/late-onset ADA deficiency. Seven out of 11 patients with SCID had homozygous defects. Five out of 7 had the same homozygous indel frameshift mutation (c.955-959delGAAGA) showing a founder effect. There were two novel splice site defects: one (IVS10+2T>C) was heterozygous in a patient with late-onset ADA deficiency, and the other was homozygous (IVS2delT+2) in a SCID patient. Other defects were missense defects. Nine out of 13 patients were put on pegylated ADA ERT. Four out of six patients were transplanted without using a conditioning regimen. HSCGT was performed to one of the patients. CONCLUSION: The genetic diagnosis of SCID is utmost important. There is a chance to give ERT before the definitive therapy if the patient with SCID/CID has ADA deficiency. Although ERT was insufficient to restore a normal immune function in ADA-SCID patients, it was useful to improve and stabilize the clinical status before curative therapy (aHSCT/HSCGT). Enzyme replacement therapy was successful in patients with late-/delayed-onset ADA deficiency who presented with the features of combined immunodeficiency. Gastrointestinal polyposis in a patient with late-onset ADA deficiency may be an association or a coincidental finding. Intermittent neurodevelopmental evaluation especially for hearing impairment should be performed in most of the ADA-deficient patients. This may alleviate the speech delay and cognitive abnormalities which may be observed in the follow-up.",

From what was once a uniformly fatal disease, the prognosis for infants with ADA SCID has improved greatly based on the development of multiple therapeutic options, coupled with more frequent early diagnosis due to implementation of newborn screening for SCID. We review the various treatment approaches for ADA SCID including allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from a human leukocyte antigen-matched sibling or family member or from a matched unrelated donor or a haplo-identical donor, autologous HSCT with gene correction of the hematopoietic stem cells (gene therapy-GT), and enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with polyethylene glycol-conjugated adenosine deaminase. Based on growing evidence of safety and efficacy from GT, we propose a treatment algorithm for patients with ADA SCID that recommends HSCT from a matched family donor, when available, as a first choice, followed by GT as the next option, with allogeneic HSCT from an unrelated or haplo-identical donor or long-term ERT as other options.",

Enzyme-replacement therapy was not given after infusion of the cells. RESULTS: All patients are alive after a median follow-up of 4.0 years (range, 1.8 to 8.0).

OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess the outcomes of 23 mostly conditioned patients with SCID and compare their outcomes with those of 25 previously reported nonconditioned patients with SCID who underwent transplantation. METHODS: In the present study we reviewed the medical records of these 23 consecutive, mostly conditioned patients with SCID who underwent transplantation between 1998 and 2007. RESULTS: Eighteen patients (median age at transplantation, 10 months; range, 0.8-108 months) received haploidentical mismatched related donor, matched unrelated donor, or mismatched unrelated donor transplants, 17 of whom received pretransplantation conditioning (with 1 not conditioned); 13 (72%) patients engrafted with donor cells and survive at a median of 3.8 years (range, 1.8-9.8 year); 5 (38%) of 13 patients require intravenous immunoglobulin; and 6 of 6 age-eligible children attend school. Of 5 recipients (median age at transplantation, 7 months; range, 2-23 months) of matched related donor transplants, all 5 engrafted and survive at a median of 7.5 years (range, 1.5-9.5 year), 1 recipient requires intravenous immunoglobulin, and 3 of 3 age-eligible children attend school. Gene mutations were known in 16 cases: mutation in the common gamma chain of the IL-2 receptor (IL2RG) in 7 patients, mutation in the alpha chain of the IL-7 receptor (IL7RA) in 4 patients, mutation in the recombinase-activating gene (RAG1) in 2 patients, adenosine deaminase deficiency (ADA) in 2 patients, and adenylate kinase 2 (AK2) in 1 patient. Early outcomes and quality of life of the previous nonconditioned versus the present conditioned cohorts were not statistically different, but longer-term follow-up is necessary for confirmation. CONCLUSIONS: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in patients with SCID results in engraftment, long-term survival, and a good quality of life for the majority of patients with or without pretransplantation conditioning.",

OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess the outcomes of 23 mostly conditioned patients with SCID and compare their outcomes with those of 25 previously reported nonconditioned patients with SCID who underwent transplantation. METHODS: In the present study we reviewed the medical records of these 23 consecutive, mostly conditioned patients with SCID who underwent transplantation between 1998 and 2007. RESULTS: Eighteen patients (median age at transplantation, 10 months; range, 0.8-108 months) received haploidentical mismatched related donor, matched unrelated donor, or mismatched unrelated donor transplants, 17 of whom received pretransplantation conditioning (with 1 not conditioned); 13 (72%) patients engrafted with donor cells and survive at a median of 3.8 years (range, 1.8-9.8 year); 5 (38%) of 13 patients require intravenous immunoglobulin; and 6 of 6 age-eligible children attend school. Of 5 recipients (median age at transplantation, 7 months; range, 2-23 months) of matched related donor transplants, all 5 engrafted and survive at a median of 7.5 years (range, 1.5-9.5 year), 1 recipient requires intravenous immunoglobulin, and 3 of 3 age-eligible children attend school. Gene mutations were known in 16 cases: mutation in the common gamma chain of the IL-2 receptor (IL2RG) in 7 patients, mutation in the alpha chain of the IL-7 receptor (IL7RA) in 4 patients, mutation in the recombinase-activating gene (RAG1) in 2 patients, adenosine deaminase deficiency (ADA) in 2 patients, and adenylate kinase 2 (AK2) in 1 patient. Early outcomes and quality of life of the previous nonconditioned versus the present conditioned cohorts were not statistically different, but longer-term follow-up is necessary for confirmation. CONCLUSIONS: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in patients with SCID results in engraftment, long-term survival, and a good quality of life for the majority of patients with or without pretransplantation conditioning.",

Depending on the underlying genetic defect and when blocks in differentiation occur during lymphocyte ontogeny, infants with SCID have absent or greatly reduced numbers of functional T cells.

METHODS: A retrospective data analysis considered whether host NK cells influenced donor T-cell engraftment, immune reconstitution, and long-term outcomes in children who had undergone nonconditioned allogeneic stem cell transplantation between 1990 and 2011 in the United Kingdom. Detailed analysis of T- and B-cell immune reconstitution and donor chimerism was compared between the NK(+) (n = 24) and NK(-) (n = 53) forms of SCID. RESULTS: Overall, 77 children underwent transplantation, with survival of 90% in matched sibling donor/matched family donor transplants compared with 60% when alternative donors were used. Infants with NK(-)SCID were more likely to survive than NK(+) recipients (87% vs 62%, P < .01) and had high-level donor T-cell chimerism with superior long-term recovery of CD4 T-cell immunity.

Hematopoietic stem cells have been considered excellent targets for therapeutic gene transfer because of their capacity for self-renewal and for differentiation into multiple cellular lineages. Retrovirus-mediated gene transfer has been tested for treatment of diseases that specifically affect the hematopoietic system, such as adenosine deaminase deficiency and chronic granulomatous disease. Storage disorders such as Gaucher disease, Hurler syndrome and Hunter syndrome, genetic deficiencies that affect a broad range of tissue types, may also be amenable to treatment by gene transfer into hematopoietic cells, owing to the release of enzyme expressed in transduced cells with subsequent uptake by untransduced cells (\"metabolic cross-correction\"). Hematopoietic stem cells may also be targeted for introduction of drug-resistance genes for the purpose of protecting normal tissues from the toxic side-effects of cancer chemotherapeutic agents, thus allowing more effective antitumor chemotherapy. The danger of introducing drug-resistance function into tumor cells may be dealt with by including sequences specifically designed to reduce expression of oncogenes or to restore expression of tumor suppressor genes. Current limitations on the efficiency of gene transfer into hematopoietic stem cells may be alleviated by the development of new vector systems such as adeno-associated virus or lentivirus vectors, or by advances in cell processing that render hematopoietic cells more susceptible to transduction. Drug-resistance genes may also be applied for in vivo selection to expand the representation of a small proportion of transduced hematopoietic cells. These approaches toward increasing the frequency of hematopoietic cell transduction contribute to the anticipated feasibility of gene therapy for genetic diseases and cancer.",

It is a benign, asymptomatic disease of the oral mucosa caused by human papilloma viruses (HPV). Previous studies postulated an association between these lesions and immunodeficiency. Genetic deficiency of adenosine deaminase (ADA) results in varying degrees of immunodeficiency, including neonatal onset severe combined immunodeficiency (ADA-SCID), and milder, later onset immunodeficiency. We report a 12-year-old girl with the late onset-ADA deficiency presenting with Heck's disease.

Recently, ADA deficiency has been successfully treated using lentiviral-transduced autologous CD34+ cells carrying the ADA gene. T and B cell function appears to be fully restored, but in many patients' B cell numbers remain low, and assessments of the immunoglobulin heavy (IgHV) repertoire following gene therapy are lacking. METHODS: We performed deep sequencing of IgHV repertoire in peripheral blood lymphocytes from a child following lentivirus-based gene therapy for ADA deficiency and compared to the IgHV repertoire in healthy infants and adults. RESULTS: After gene therapy, Ig diversity increased over time as evidenced by V, D, and J gene usage, N-additions, CDR3 length, extent of somatic hypermutation, and Ig class switching. There was the emergence of predominant IgHM, IgHG, and IgHA CDR3 lengths after gene therapy indicating successful oligoclonal expansion in response to antigens. This provides proof of concept for the feasibility and utility of molecular monitoring in following B cell reconstitution following gene therapy for ADA deficiency.

Clinical trials of human gene therapy began with the ex vivo techniques. Based on the initial successes of gene-therapy clinical trials, these approaches have spread worldwide. The number of gene therapy trials approved worldwide increased gradually starting in 1989, reaching 116 protocols per year in 1999, and a total of 2210 protocols had been approved by 2015. Accumulating clinical evidence has demonstrated the safety and benefits of several types of gene therapy, with the exception of serious adverse events in several clinical trials. These painful experiences were translated backward to basic science, resulting in the development of several new technologies that have influenced the recent development of ex vivo gene therapy in this field. To date, six gene therapies have been approved in a limited number of countries worldwide. In Japan, clinical trials of gene therapy have developed under the strong influence of trials in the US and Europe. Since the initial stages, 50 clinical trials have been approved by the Japanese government. In this review, the history and current status of clinical trials of ex vivo gene therapy for hematological disorders are introduced and discussed. ",

Despite the earlier success, the production of retroviral vectors for clinical gene therapy is cumbersome, costly and lacks safety features because of the adherent nature of packaging cells and the necessity to supplement the culture media with bovine serum. The aim of this study was to generate a retrovirus packaging cell line that could be used for the production of large clinical batch vectors. Bicistronic vectors containing an internal ribosomal entry site followed by a selection gene were used to express Moloney murine leukemia gag-pol and amphotropic envelope viral proteins in HEK293 cells. The candidate clone (293GP-A2) that was selected as the packaging cell line could release recombinant green fluorescent protein retroviruses at 4x10(7) infectious viral particles per ml. Similar titers were achieved after these cells were adapted to grow in suspension and serum-free media. Furthermore, using the same culture conditions viral titers proved to be stable for a 3-month culture period. The 293GP-A2 packaging cell line has the potential to be cultured in bioreactors, opening the possibility for large-scale use of retroviral vectors in late stage clinical trials.",

Despite the earlier success, the production of retroviral vectors for clinical gene therapy is cumbersome, costly and lacks safety features because of the adherent nature of packaging cells and the necessity to supplement the culture media with bovine serum. The aim of this study was to generate a retrovirus packaging cell line that could be used for the production of large clinical batch vectors. Bicistronic vectors containing an internal ribosomal entry site followed by a selection gene were used to express Moloney murine leukemia gag-pol and amphotropic envelope viral proteins in HEK293 cells. The candidate clone (293GP-A2) that was selected as the packaging cell line could release recombinant green fluorescent protein retroviruses at 4x10(7) infectious viral particles per ml. Similar titers were achieved after these cells were adapted to grow in suspension and serum-free media. Furthermore, using the same culture conditions viral titers proved to be stable for a 3-month culture period. The 293GP-A2 packaging cell line has the potential to be cultured in bioreactors, opening the possibility for large-scale use of retroviral vectors in late stage clinical trials.",

                    "text": "Successful engraftment of haploidentical stem cell transplant with post-transplantation cyclophosphamide in a patient with adenosine deaminase deficiency.BACKGROUND: SCID are characterized by an imbalance in cellular and humoral immunity. Enzyme ADA deficiency represents from 10% to 15% of the SCID. This generates diminished maturation of the cell precursors. Treatments include enzyme replacement therapy, allogenic, or autologous HSCT with gene therapy, with HSCT being of choice when an identical HLA donor exists. CASE REPORT: Male patient, without relevant family antecedents or consanguinity. The patient had multiple infections during the first months of life, evidencing low immunoglobulin levels, with absence of T and B lymphocytes, and natural killer cells. Severe combined immunodeficiencies are considered due to ADA deficiency; management was begun and is derived to our hospital. Admission at 8 months of life, with chronic malnutrition and psychomotor retardation. The HLA studies were conducted without finding an identical donor, taken to HSCT with haploidentical donor. Conditioning regimen with cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, melphalan, and thymoglobulin. This patient received prophylaxis for graft-versus-host disease with cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, and methotrexate. A 22 months post-transplant, the patient was without immunosuppressants or immunoglobulin, without evidence of graft-versus-host disease or new infections. CONCLUSIONS: The ADA deficiency is an infrequent pathology that can be potentially fatal if adequate treatment is not started. Haploidentical HSCT, using post-transplantation cyclophosphamide, emerges as a viable option with which good results can be achieved and improve the quality of life in patients with no other therapeutic alternatives.",

Enzyme ADA deficiency represents from 10% to 15% of the SCID. This generates diminished maturation of the cell precursors. Treatments include enzyme replacement therapy, allogenic, or autologous HSCT with gene therapy, with HSCT being of choice when an identical HLA donor exists. CASE REPORT: Male patient, without relevant family antecedents or consanguinity. The patient had multiple infections during the first months of life, evidencing low immunoglobulin levels, with absence of T and B lymphocytes, and natural killer cells. Severe combined immunodeficiencies are considered due to ADA deficiency; management was begun and is derived to our hospital. Admission at 8 months of life, with chronic malnutrition and psychomotor retardation. The HLA studies were conducted without finding an identical donor, taken to HSCT with haploidentical donor. Conditioning regimen with cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, melphalan, and thymoglobulin. This patient received prophylaxis for graft-versus-host disease with cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, and methotrexate. A 22 months post-transplant, the patient was without immunosuppressants or immunoglobulin, without evidence of graft-versus-host disease or new infections. CONCLUSIONS: The ADA deficiency is an infrequent pathology that can be potentially fatal if adequate treatment is not started. Haploidentical HSCT, using post-transplantation cyclophosphamide, emerges as a viable option with which good results can be achieved and improve the quality of life in patients with no other therapeutic alternatives.",

A rapid quantitative purine assay was developed using UPLC-MS/MS to determine purine nucleoside and base concentrations in urine. Taking advantages of ultra performance liquid chromatography, we achieved satisfactory analyte separation and recovery with a polar T3 column in a short run time with no requirement of time-consuming sample preparation or derivatization. This targeted assay is intended for diagnosis and management of purine diseases, newborn screening follow-up of SCID, and evaluation of autism spectrum disorders.",

Because hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and enzyme replacement therapy with pegylated bovine ADA (PEG-ADA) are both provided in our hospital, we undertook a retrospective longitudinal comparative study of the extent of lymphocyte recovery in two groups of treated ADA-SCID children.

The stable production of kappa-deleting recombination excision circle(+) lymphocytes sustained an increase in B cell number in HSCT-treated patients, whereas in PEG-ADA-treated patients, it was accompanied by a significant and progressive decrease in circulating CD19(+) lymphocytes, which never reached the levels observed in age-matched children. The mobilization of TCR excision circle(+) cells, though lower than in controls, was stable with time after HSCT treatment, leading to a constant peripheral T cell number and to the diversification of the T cell repertoire; however, it was compromised in children receiving prolonged PEG-ADA therapy, whose T cells showed progressively narrowing T cell repertoires.",

If the disease is left untreated, it is likely to have a fatal outcome in early infancy. Because hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and enzyme replacement therapy with pegylated bovine ADA (PEG-ADA) are both provided in our hospital, we undertook a retrospective longitudinal comparative study of the extent of lymphocyte recovery in two groups of treated ADA-SCID children. Together with classical immunological parameters, we quantified the output of the new B and T cells from the production sites using the kappa-deleting recombination excision circle and TCR excision circle assay, and we monitored T cell repertoire diversification. We found that immune reconstitution was different following the two treatments. The stable production of kappa-deleting recombination excision circle(+) lymphocytes sustained an increase in B cell number in HSCT-treated patients, whereas in PEG-ADA-treated patients, it was accompanied by a significant and progressive decrease in circulating CD19(+) lymphocytes, which never reached the levels observed in age-matched children. The mobilization of TCR excision circle(+) cells, though lower than in controls, was stable with time after HSCT treatment, leading to a constant peripheral T cell number and to the diversification of the T cell repertoire; however, it was compromised in children receiving prolonged PEG-ADA therapy, whose T cells showed progressively narrowing T cell repertoires.",

However, recent disappointing results of the considerable clinical trials have also clearly demonstrated that such an initial expectation was an overestimation of gene therapy. There are only a few successful cases despite the 3000 patients who have been treated with various forms of gene therapy. Gene therapy for severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) caused by adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency is one of the few such cases where results have been promising. In particular, peripheral T-lymphocytes-directed gene therapy provides further immunological improvements for patients with ADA-SCID receiving the PEG-ADA treatment whereas gene therapy targeting haematopoietic stem cell has so far proved insufficient for clinical benefits. This report will review crucial problems elucidated in the past five clinical trials for ADA-SCID and gives an outline of the next generation of stem cell gene therapy in Japan.",

It has been recently shown that native donor HSCs can reach the fetal circulation and bone marrow after simple delivery into the amniotic fluid, at least in a syngeneic healthy model. We sought to determine whether the transamniotic route could also be a practical alternative for the fetal administration of genetically modified HSCs in a comparable model. Pregnant Lewis rat dams underwent volume-matched intra-amniotic injections in all their fetuses (n = 47) on gestational day 17 (E17; term = E21-22) of donor HSCs genetically modified using a custom lentiviral vector designed to constitutively express both a firefly luciferase reporter gene and a human adenosine deaminase (ADA) transgene. Donor HSCs consisted of syngeneic cells isolated from the amniotic fluid and phenotyped by flow cytometry. Fetuses were euthanized at term, when seven select sites relevant to HSC-based therapies were screened for either luciferase activity by luminometry or for the presence of human ADA mRNA by digital droplet polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR). Among survivors (30/47; 64%), positive luminescence and positive human ADA expression were detected in the bone marrow (respectively, 33% and 76%), liver (respectively, 11% and 81%), spleen (respectively, 11% and 67%), thymus (respectively, 33% and 67%), lungs (respectively, 44% and 86%), and brain (respectively, 22% and 90%).

We conclude that genetically modified HSCs can reach the fetal circulation and fetal bone marrow after simple intra-amniotic administration in a syngeneic rat model.

                    "text": "Transamniotic Fetal Administration of Genetically Modified Hematopoietic Stem Cells Carrying a Human Transgene in a Syngeneic Rat Model.Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-based gene therapy has already reached clinical reality in a few applications. Fetal administration of genetically modified HSCs has only been feasible to date through invasive and morbid methods. It has been recently shown that native donor HSCs can reach the fetal circulation and bone marrow after simple delivery into the amniotic fluid, at least in a syngeneic healthy model. We sought to determine whether the transamniotic route could also be a practical alternative for the fetal administration of genetically modified HSCs in a comparable model. Pregnant Lewis rat dams underwent volume-matched intra-amniotic injections in all their fetuses (n = 47) on gestational day 17 (E17; term = E21-22) of donor HSCs genetically modified using a custom lentiviral vector designed to constitutively express both a firefly luciferase reporter gene and a human adenosine deaminase (ADA) transgene. Donor HSCs consisted of syngeneic cells isolated from the amniotic fluid and phenotyped by flow cytometry. Fetuses were euthanized at term, when seven select sites relevant to HSC-based therapies were screened for either luciferase activity by luminometry or for the presence of human ADA mRNA by digital droplet polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR). Among survivors (30/47; 64%), positive luminescence and positive human ADA expression were detected in the bone marrow (respectively, 33% and 76%), liver (respectively, 11% and 81%), spleen (respectively, 11% and 67%), thymus (respectively, 33% and 67%), lungs (respectively, 44% and 86%), and brain (respectively, 22% and 90%). Nucleated peripheral blood cells were analyzed only by ddPCR, showing positive human ADA expression at 54%. We conclude that genetically modified HSCs can reach the fetal circulation and fetal bone marrow after simple intra-amniotic administration in a syngeneic rat model. Gene therapy by transamniotic HSC delivery may become a practicable, minimally invasive strategy for the prenatal treatment of select hemoglobinopathies, immunodeficiencies, and inherited metabolic disorders.",

Conditioning therapy is necessary for reliable engraftment and full immune reconstitution; however, the beneficial effect of cytoreductive conditioning is counterbalanced by increased short- and long-term treatment-related toxicity. Whether bone marrow transplantation with a nonmyeloablative preparative regimen was sufficient for the establishment of donor immune reconstitution, with the resultant correction of disease phenotype, was investigated. Eight patients with severe immunodeficiency states underwent T-cell replete bone marrow transplantation from a human leukocyte antigen-matched unrelated (n = 6) or sibling (n = 2) donor with nonmyeloablative conditioning using a fludarabine-melphalan-anti-lymphocyte globulin-based regimen. All patients had severe organ dysfunction that precluded transplantation with conventional conditioning. All patients were engrafted with predominantly donor hematopoiesis, and the duration of neutropenia was brief. Significant acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) did not develop, but one patient had limited chronic GVHD. One patient died of disease recurrence, and 3 have stable, mixed chimerism. At a median follow-up of 1 year, all patients have had good recovery of CD3(+) T-cell numbers, and 6 of 7 evaluable patients have normal phytohemagglutinin stimulation indices. The rate of immune reconstitution is comparable with that of historical controls undergoing standard myeloablative protocols. Two patients with CD40 ligand deficiency now show significant expression, and a patient with adenosine deaminase deficiency has improved deoxy adenosine triphosphate metabolites. In summary, it has been demonstrated that nonmyeloablative stem cell transplantation permits rapid engraftment from both sibling and unrelated donors with minimal toxicity even in the presence of severe organ dysfunction. If long-term immune reconstitution of patients treated with this protocol is demonstrated, it is believed this approach might offer significant advantages compared with standard protocols by combining adequate immune reconstitution with reduced short- and long-term toxicity.

Whether bone marrow transplantation with a nonmyeloablative preparative regimen was sufficient for the establishment of donor immune reconstitution, with the resultant correction of disease phenotype, was investigated. Eight patients with severe immunodeficiency states underwent T-cell replete bone marrow transplantation from a human leukocyte antigen-matched unrelated (n = 6) or sibling (n = 2) donor with nonmyeloablative conditioning using a fludarabine-melphalan-anti-lymphocyte globulin-based regimen.

Previous clinical trials showed that autologous CD34+ cell gene therapy (GT) following busulfan reduced-intensity conditioning is a promising therapeutic approach for ADA-SCID, but long-term data are warranted. Here we report an analysis on long-term safety and efficacy data of 43 patients with ADA-SCID who received retroviral ex vivo bone marrow-derived hematopoietic stem cell GT. Twenty-two individuals (median follow-up 15.4 years) were treated in the context of clinical development or named patient program. Nineteen patients were treated post-marketing authorization (median follow-up 3.2 years), and two additional patients received mobilized peripheral blood CD34+ cell GT. At data cutoff, all 43 patients were alive, with a median follow-up of 5.0 years (interquartile range 2.4-15.4) and 2 years intervention-free survival (no need for long-term enzyme replacement therapy or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation) of 88% (95% confidence interval 78.7-98.4%). Most adverse events/reactions were related to disease background, busulfan conditioning or immune reconstitution; the safety profile of the real world experience was in line with premarketing cohort. One patient from the named patient program developed a T cell leukemia related to treatment 4.7 years after GT and is currently in remission. Long-term persistence of multilineage gene-corrected cells, metabolic detoxification, immune reconstitution and decreased infection rates were observed. Estimated mixed-effects models showed that higher dose of CD34+ cells infused and younger age at GT affected positively the plateau of CD3+ transduced cells, lymphocytes and CD4+ CD45RA+ naive T cells, whereas the cell dose positively influenced the final plateau of CD15+ transduced cells. These long-term data suggest that the risk-benefit of GT in ADA remains favorable and warrant for continuing long-term safety monitoring. Clinical trial registration: NCT00598481 , NCT03478670 .",

METHODS: The NYS algorithm utilizes a first-tier molecular screen for TRECs (T-cell receptor excision circles), the absence of which is indicative of increased risk of immunodeficiency. RESULTS: During the first 2 years, 485,912 infants were screened for SCID. Repeat specimens were requested from 561 premature and 746 non-premature infants with low or borderline TRECs. A total of 531 infants were referred for diagnostic evaluation leading to identification of 10 infants with SCID and 87 with a clinically significant non-SCID abnormality based on flow cytometry or CBC results (positive predictive value 20.3 %). Nine infants were diagnosed with typical SCID and one with leaky SCID. SCID diagnoses included two patients with adenosine deaminase deficiency, three patients with typical and one with leaky IL2RG-related SCID, one patient with IL7Ralpha-related SCID, and three cases of typical SCID, etiology unknown. TRECs were undetectable in eight of the nine babies with typical SCID. Infants with other non-SCID conditions included 27 patients with a syndrome that included T-cell impairment, 18 of which had DiGeorge syndrome. Seventeen infants had T-cell impairment secondary to another clinically significant condition, and 13 were classified as 'other'. Among 30 infants classified as idiopathic T-cell lymphopenia, 11 have since resolved, and the remainder continues to be followed. One infant with undetectable TRECs had normal follow-up studies. Molecular studies revealed the presence of two changes in the infant's DNA. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, ten infants with SCID were identified during the first 2 years of screening in NYS, yielding an incidence of approximately 1 in 48,500 live births, which is consistent with the incidence observed by other states screening for SCID. The incidence of any clinically significant laboratory abnormality was approximately 1 in 5,000; both estimates are higher than estimates prior to the onset of newborn screening for SCID. Improvements to the NYS algorithm included the addition of a borderline category that reduced the proportion of infants referred for flow cytometric analysis, without decreasing sensitivity. We identified a large number of infants with abnormal TRECs and subsequent idiopathic T-cell lymphopenia. Long-term follow-up studies are needed to determine the prognosis and optimal treatment for this group of patients, some of whom may present with previously unrecognized, transient lymphopenia of infancy.",

                    "text": "Newborn screening for SCID in New York State: experience from the first two years.PURPOSE: To describe the process and assess outcomes for the first 2 years of newborn screening for severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID NBS) in New York State (NYS). METHODS: The NYS algorithm utilizes a first-tier molecular screen for TRECs (T-cell receptor excision circles), the absence of which is indicative of increased risk of immunodeficiency. RESULTS: During the first 2 years, 485,912 infants were screened for SCID. Repeat specimens were requested from 561 premature and 746 non-premature infants with low or borderline TRECs. A total of 531 infants were referred for diagnostic evaluation leading to identification of 10 infants with SCID and 87 with a clinically significant non-SCID abnormality based on flow cytometry or CBC results (positive predictive value 20.3 %). Nine infants were diagnosed with typical SCID and one with leaky SCID. SCID diagnoses included two patients with adenosine deaminase deficiency, three patients with typical and one with leaky IL2RG-related SCID, one patient with IL7Ralpha-related SCID, and three cases of typical SCID, etiology unknown. TRECs were undetectable in eight of the nine babies with typical SCID. Infants with other non-SCID conditions included 27 patients with a syndrome that included T-cell impairment, 18 of which had DiGeorge syndrome. Seventeen infants had T-cell impairment secondary to another clinically significant condition, and 13 were classified as 'other'. Among 30 infants classified as idiopathic T-cell lymphopenia, 11 have since resolved, and the remainder continues to be followed. One infant with undetectable TRECs had normal follow-up studies. Molecular studies revealed the presence of two changes in the infant's DNA. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, ten infants with SCID were identified during the first 2 years of screening in NYS, yielding an incidence of approximately 1 in 48,500 live births, which is consistent with the incidence observed by other states screening for SCID. The incidence of any clinically significant laboratory abnormality was approximately 1 in 5,000; both estimates are higher than estimates prior to the onset of newborn screening for SCID. Improvements to the NYS algorithm included the addition of a borderline category that reduced the proportion of infants referred for flow cytometric analysis, without decreasing sensitivity. We identified a large number of infants with abnormal TRECs and subsequent idiopathic T-cell lymphopenia. Long-term follow-up studies are needed to determine the prognosis and optimal treatment for this group of patients, some of whom may present with previously unrecognized, transient lymphopenia of infancy.",

STUDY DESIGN: We constructed a decision analysis model to estimate the costs and benefits of NBS in an annual birth cohort of 86 600 infants based on projections of avoided infant deaths. Point estimates and ranges for input variables, including the birth prevalence of SCID, proportion detected asymptomatically without screening through family history, screening test characteristics, survival rates, and costs of screening, diagnosis, and treatment were derived from published estimates, expert opinion, and the Washington NBS program. We estimated treatment costs stratified by age of identification and SCID type (with or without adenosine deaminase deficiency). Economic benefit was estimated using values of $4.2 and $9.0 million per death averted. We performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the influence of key variables on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of net direct cost per life-year saved. RESULTS: Our model predicts an additional 1.19 newborn infants with SCID detected preclinically through screening, in addition to those who would have been detected early through family history, and 0.40 deaths averted annually. Our base-case model suggests an ICER of $35 311 per life-year saved, and a benefit-cost ratio of either 5.31 or 2.71. Sensitivity analyses found ICER values <$100 000 and positive net benefit for plausible assumptions on all variables. CONCLUSIONS: Our model suggests that NBS for SCID in Washington is likely to be cost-effective and to show positive net economic benefit.",

We describe a 34-week female twin who had developed feeding intolerance, perioral cyanosis, abdominal distension and neutropenia at 1 month of age. Despite several evaluations including an 'inconclusive' newborn screening result for SCID, the presence of profound lymphopenia was unappreciated. Eventually a diagnosis of SCID in association with adenosine deaminase deficiency was made. This case serves to emphasize the importance of newborn screening for SCID in the context of careful evaluation of clinical and laboratory findings that may be overlooked and result in a delay in the diagnosis of a potentially life-threatening condition.

We investigated B cell deficiency in ADA-deficient mice and found that B cell development in the bone marrow was normal. However, spleens were markedly smaller, their architecture was dramatically altered, and splenic B lymphocytes showed defects in proliferation and activation. ADA-deficient B cells exhibited a higher propensity to undergo B cell receptor-mediated apoptosis than their wild-type counterparts, suggesting that ADA plays a role in the survival of cells during Ag-dependent responses. In keeping with this finding, IgM production by extrafollicular plasmablast cells was higher in ADA-deficient than in wild-type mice, thus indicating that activated B cells accumulate extrafollicularly as a result of a poor or nonexistent germinal center formation. This hypothesis was subsequently confirmed by the profound loss of germinal center architecture. A comparison of levels of the ADA substrates, adenosine and 2'-deoxyadenosine, as well resulting dATP levels and S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase inhibition in bone marrow and spleen suggested that dATP accumulation in ADA-deficient spleens may be responsible for impaired B cell development. The altered splenic environment and signaling abnormalities may concurrently contribute to a block in B cell Ag-dependent maturation in ADA-deficient mouse spleens.",

This review will summarize current information on the mechanisms of insertional mutagenesis in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells due to integrating gene transfer vectors, discuss the available assays for predicting genotoxicity and mapping vector integration sites, and introduce newly-developed approaches for minimizing genotoxicity as a way to further move HSC gene therapy forward into broader clinical application.",

We suggest that these changes are reversible with appropriate enzyme replacement therapy. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to describe characteristic rib and scapular radiographic changes in infants with ADA-deficiency SCIDS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective review of chest radiographs of nine children with ADA-deficiency SCIDS performed in the first year of life by two experienced pediatric radiologists. A control cohort of unaffected children was used for comparison. RESULTS: All children with ADA-deficiency SCIDS manifested unusual scapular spurring and anterior rib cupping. None of the control children manifested these changes. CONCLUSION: Characteristic and reversible scapular and rib changes in the correct clinical setting should suggest an early diagnosis of ADA deficiency, prompting appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic measures.",

We suggest that these changes are reversible with appropriate enzyme replacement therapy. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to describe characteristic rib and scapular radiographic changes in infants with ADA-deficiency SCIDS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective review of chest radiographs of nine children with ADA-deficiency SCIDS performed in the first year of life by two experienced pediatric radiologists. A control cohort of unaffected children was used for comparison. RESULTS: All children with ADA-deficiency SCIDS manifested unusual scapular spurring and anterior rib cupping. None of the control children manifested these changes. CONCLUSION: Characteristic and reversible scapular and rib changes in the correct clinical setting should suggest an early diagnosis of ADA deficiency, prompting appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic measures.",

As this protocol has features distinct from those of other clinical trials, its results provide insights into SCGT for ADA deficiency. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Pt 1 was treated at age 4.7 years, whereas pt 2, who had previously received T-cell gene therapy, was treated at age 13 years. Bone marrow CD34(+) cells were harvested after enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) was withdrawn; following transduction of ADA cDNA by the gamma-retroviral vector GCsapM-ADA, they were administered intravenously. No cytoreductive conditioning, at present considered critical for therapeutic benefit, was given before cell infusion. Hematological/immunological reconstitution kinetics, levels of systemic detoxification, gene-marking levels, and proviral insertion sites in hematopoietic cells were assessed. RESULTS: Treatment was well tolerated, and no serious adverse events were observed. Engraftment of gene-modified repopulating cells was evidenced by the appearance and maintenance of peripheral lymphocytes expressing functional ADA. Systemic detoxification was moderately achieved, allowing temporary discontinuation of ERT for 6 and 10 years in pt 1 and pt 2, respectively. Recovery of immunity remained partial, with lymphocyte counts in pts 1 and 2, peaked at 408/mm(3) and 1248/mm(3), approximately 2 and 5 years after SCGT. Vector integration site analyses confirmed that hematopoiesis was reconstituted with a limited number of clones, some of which were shown to have myelo-lymphoid potential. CONCLUSIONS: Outcomes in SCGT for ADA-SCID are described in the context of a unique protocol, which used neither ERT nor cytoreductive conditioning.

                    "text": "Outcomes in two Japanese adenosine deaminase-deficiency patients treated by stem cell gene therapy with no cytoreductive conditioning.OBJECTIVE: We here describe treatment outcomes in two adenosine deaminase (ADA)-deficiency patients (pt) who received stem cell gene therapy (SCGT) with no cytoreductive conditioning. As this protocol has features distinct from those of other clinical trials, its results provide insights into SCGT for ADA deficiency. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Pt 1 was treated at age 4.7 years, whereas pt 2, who had previously received T-cell gene therapy, was treated at age 13 years. Bone marrow CD34(+) cells were harvested after enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) was withdrawn; following transduction of ADA cDNA by the gamma-retroviral vector GCsapM-ADA, they were administered intravenously. No cytoreductive conditioning, at present considered critical for therapeutic benefit, was given before cell infusion. Hematological/immunological reconstitution kinetics, levels of systemic detoxification, gene-marking levels, and proviral insertion sites in hematopoietic cells were assessed. RESULTS: Treatment was well tolerated, and no serious adverse events were observed. Engraftment of gene-modified repopulating cells was evidenced by the appearance and maintenance of peripheral lymphocytes expressing functional ADA. Systemic detoxification was moderately achieved, allowing temporary discontinuation of ERT for 6 and 10 years in pt 1 and pt 2, respectively. Recovery of immunity remained partial, with lymphocyte counts in pts 1 and 2, peaked at 408/mm(3) and 1248/mm(3), approximately 2 and 5 years after SCGT. Vector integration site analyses confirmed that hematopoiesis was reconstituted with a limited number of clones, some of which were shown to have myelo-lymphoid potential. CONCLUSIONS: Outcomes in SCGT for ADA-SCID are described in the context of a unique protocol, which used neither ERT nor cytoreductive conditioning. Although proven safe, immune reconstitution was partial and temporary. Our results reiterate the importance of cytoreductive conditioning to ensure greater benefits from SCGT.",

In its early-onset form, it is rapidly fatal to infants. Delayed or late-onset ADA-SCID is characterized by insidious progressive immunodeficiency that leads to permanent organ damage or death. Quantification of T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) or tandem mass spectrometry (tandem-MS) analysis of dried blood spots (DBSs) collected at birth can identify newborns with early-onset ADA-SCID and are used in screening programs. However, it is not clear whether these analyses can identify newborns who will have delayed or late-onset ADA-SCID before symptoms appear. OBJECTIVE: We performed a retrospective study to evaluate whether tandem-MS and quantitative TREC analyses of DBSs could identify newborns who had delayed-onset ADA-SCID later in life. METHODS: We tested stored DBSs collected at birth from 3 patients with delayed-onset ADA-SCID using tandem-MS (PCT EP2010/070517) to evaluate levels of adenosine and 2'-deoxyadenosine and real-time PCR to quantify TREC levels. We also analyzed DBSs from 3 newborns with early-onset ADA-SCID and 2 healthy newborn carriers of ADA deficiency. RESULTS: The DBSs taken at birth from the 3 patients with delayed-onset ADA-SCID had adenosine levels of 10, 25, and 19 mumol/L (normal value, <1.5 mumol/L) and 2'-deoxyadenosine levels of 0.7, 2.7, and 2.4 mumol/L (normal value, <0.07 mumol/L); the mean levels of adenosine and 2'-deoxyadenosine were respectively 12.0- and 27.6-fold higher than normal values. DBSs taken at birth from all 3 patients with delayed-onset ADA deficiency had normal TREC levels, but TRECs were undetectable in blood samples taken from the same patients at the time of diagnosis.

Clinical trials for X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency, adenosine deaminase deficiency (ADA), chronic granulomatous disease, and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome have demonstrated that gene transfer into hematopoietic stem cells and autologous transplant can result in clinical improvement and is curative for many patients. Unfortunately, early clinical trials were complicated by vector-related insertional mutagenic events for several diseases with the exception of ADA-deficiency SCID. These results prompted the current wave of clinical trials for primary immunodeficiency using alternative retro- or lenti-viral vector constructs that are self-inactivating, and they have shown clinical efficacy without leukemic events thus far. The field of gene therapy continues to progress, with improvements in viral vector profiles, stem cell culturing techniques, and site-specific genome editing platforms.

                    "text": "How I treat ADA deficiency.Adenosine deaminase deficiency is a disorder of purine metabolism leading to severe combined immunodeficiency (ADA-SCID). Without treatment, the condition is fatal and requires early intervention. Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the major treatment for ADA-SCID, although survival following different donor sources varies considerably. Unlike other SCID forms, 2 other options are available for ADA-SCID: enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with pegylated bovine ADA, and autologous haematopoietic stem cell gene therapy (GT). Due to the rarity of the condition, the lack of large scale outcome studies, and availability of different treatments, guidance on treatment strategies is limited. We have reviewed the currently available evidence and together with our experience of managing this condition propose a consensus management strategy. Matched sibling donor transplants represent a successful treatment option with high survival rates and excellent immune recovery. Mismatched parental donor transplants have a poor survival outcome and should be avoided unless other treatments are unavailable. ERT and GT both show excellent survival, and therefore the choice between ERT, MUD transplant, or GT is difficult and dependent on several factors, including accessibility to the different modalities, response of patients to long-term ERT, and the attitudes of physicians and parents to the short- and potential long-term risks associated with different treatments.",

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is able to correct the immunodeficiency, whereas control of nonimmunologic complications has not been extensively explored. We applied HSCT in 15 ADA-deficient patients consecutively treated at our institutions since 1982 and analyzed long-term outcome. Seven patients received transplants without conditioning from HLA-matched family donors (MFDs); the other 8 patients received conditioning and were given transplants either from HLA-mismatched family donors (MMFDs; n = 6) or from matched unrelated donors (MUDs; n = 2). At a mean follow-up period of 12 years (range, 4-22 years), 12 patients are alive with stable and complete immune reconstitution (7 of 7 after MFD, 4 of 6 after MMFD, and 1 of 2 after MUD transplantation). Six of 12 surviving patients show marked neurologic abnormalities, which include mental retardation, motor dysfunction, and sensorineural hearing deficit. We were unable to identify disease or transplantation-related factors correlating with this divergent neurologic outcome. The high rate of neurologic abnormalities observed in long-term surviving patients with ADA deficiency indicates that HSCT commonly fails to control CNS complications in this metabolic disease.",

Additionally, ADA-deficient patients suffer from hearing impairment. We hypothesized that ADA-deficient (-/-) mice also exhibit hearing abnormalities and that ERT from an early age will improve the hearing and immune defects in these mice. Methods: Auditory brainstem evoked responses, organ weights, thymocytes numbers, and subpopulations, lymphocytes in peripheral blood as well as T lymphocytes in spleen were analyzed in ADA-/- and ADA-proficient littermate post-partum (pp). The cochlea was visualized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The effects of polyethylene glycol conjugated ADA (PEG-ADA) ERT or 40% oxygen initiated at 7 days pp on the hearing and immune abnormalities were assessed. Results: Markedly abnormal hearing thresholds responses were found in ADA-/- mice at low and medium tone frequencies. SEM demonstrated extensive damage to the cochlear hair cells of ADA-/- mice, which were splayed, short or missing, correlating with the hearing deficits. The hearing defects were not reversed when hypoxia in ADA-/- mice was corrected. Progressive immune abnormalities were detected in ADA-/- mice from 4 days pp, initially affecting the thymus followed by peripheral lymphocytes and T cells in the spleen. ERT initiated at 7 days pp significantly improved the hearing of ADA-/- mice as well as the number of thymocytes and T lymphocytes, although not all normalized. Conclusions: ADA deficiency is associated with hearing deficits and damage to cochlear hair cells. Early initiation of ERT improves the hearing and immune abnormalities.",

The only curative treatment for SCID is reconstitution of the patient's immunity. For more than 30 years, allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) has been extremely successful for SCID. However, BMT often results in only incomplete restoration of B cell function in treated patients, especially when haploidentical donors are used. In addition, BMT can be associated with severe complications such as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Alternative forms of therapy for SCID are therefore desirable. Genetic correction of peripheral T lymphocytes and/or haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) by retrovirally mediated gene transfer has been attempted for patients with SCID due to adenosine deaminase deficiency, the first genetic disease targeted in clinical gene therapy trials with very limited success, overall. After these pioneer trials, recent progress has led to significant improvement of gene transfer techniques and better understanding of HSC biology which has culminated in the recent success of a gene therapy trial for patients affected with X-linked SCID (X-SCID). In this trial, patients with X-SCID received autologous bone marrow stem/progenitor cells which had been retrovirally transduced with a therapeutic gene. Based on the current follow-up, the overall efficacy of this gene therapy procedure is to be considered similar to or even better than that achievable by allogeneic BMT, because patients were not exposed to the risks of GVHD. Although these exciting results have clearly demonstrated that gene therapy is a feasible therapeutic option for X-SCID, they have also raised important questions regarding the long-term outcome of this experimental procedure and the possibility of translating this success into applications for other forms of SCID.",

                    "text": "Engraftment and chimerism, particularly of T- and B-cells, in children undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.The spectrum of pediatric bone marrow transplantation has changed in recent years. Mismatched and unrelated donor transplants are common, demanding an increased vigilance to detect incipient graft failure, secondary lymphoma as well as relapse and other problems, which now are potentially treatable. To diagnose these complications it may be important to know whether blood and marrow cells are of recipient or donor origin. To evaluate the role of mixed donor-recipient chimerism in relation to clinical problems we adapted a polymerase chain-reaction technique, using fluorescent primers analyzing DNA fragment length polymorphisms, to follow prospectively 17 bone marrow grafted children. To increase the precision of chimerism analysis, immunomagnetically isolated leukocyte populations were assayed in selected cases. Five patients encountered clinical problems related to chimerism. One infant with adenosine deaminase deficiency failed to engraft stem cells, yet succumbed to graft-versus-host disease, mediated by mature donor T-cells. Three children developed significant mixed chimerism. One of these three patients died in relapse of leukemia, while the two other patients who had received T-cell depleted grafts had persistent recipient T-cells, in spite of engraftment. After 5 months, these were displaced by donor T-cells in one of the patients. In the fifth patient, also after T-cell depleted BMT, a fatal donor cell lymphoma occurred. Twelve children had stable full chimerism or in one case a low grade mixed chimerism and remain disease-free throughout follow up (median 9 months). In conclusion, the analysis of chimerism, particularly of separated leukocyte populations, offers an almost indispensable insight and a basis for therapeutic decisions in complicated situations such as grafting involving unrelated or mismatched donors, graft manipulation, adoptive immunotherapy and in immunodeficiency patients.",

                    "text": "Gene therapy for PIDs: progress, pitfalls and prospects.Substantial progress has been made in the past decade in treating several primary immunodeficiency disorders (PIDs) with gene therapy. Current approaches are based on ex-vivo transfer of therapeutic transgene via viral vectors to patient-derived autologous hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) followed by transplantation back to the patient with or without conditioning. The overall outcome from all the clinical trials targeting different PIDs has been extremely encouraging but not without caveats. Malignant outcomes from insertional mutagenesis have featured prominently in the adverse events associated with these trials and have warranted intense pre-clinical investigation into defining the tendencies of different viral vectors for genomic integration. Coupled with issues pertaining to transgene expression, the therapeutic landscape has undergone a paradigm shift in determining safety, stability and efficacy of gene therapy approaches. In this review, we aim to summarize the progress made in the gene therapy trials targeting ADA-SCID, SCID-X1, CGD and WAS, review the pitfalls, and outline the recent advancements which are expected to further enhance favourable risk benefit ratios for gene therapeutic approaches in the future.",

Strimvelis, a patient-specific gene-modified stem cell medicine for ADA-SCID (adenosine deaminase deficiency leading to severe combined immunodeficiency; a fatal immunometabolic disorder similar to the bubble-boy disease), was developed by scientists at the San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy (TIGET) in Milan, Italy, which then later partnered with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK, Brentford, UK). The journey took more than 25 years of dedicated work by many groups and involved a pivotal trial with 12 children and their brave families. I was fortunate to be involved on the GSK side of the TIGET alliance from 2010 to 2015, building on my previous experiences with gene-modified stem cells during a postdoctoral fellowship in the mid-1990s and at Chiron, which had acquired Viagene, an early gene therapy biotech firm. I thought it was timely to pick out a couple of observations from the development of Strimvelis, to see how these might apply to the future of stem cell gene therapy and perhaps act like shoulders for the related chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) and gene-editing technologies to stand on.",

To better understand the causes of T-cell depletion in vivo and to discriminate between extracellular and intracellular effects of exogenously added adenosine in vitro, we investigated mechanisms of 2 different effects of adenosine on murine thymocytes.

Despite the setbacks gene therapy has faced, success stories have increasingly emerged. Examples for these are the positive recommendation for a gene therapy product (Glybera) by the EMA for approval in the European Union and the positive trials for the treatment of ADA deficiency, SCID-X1 and adrenoleukodystrophy. Nevertheless, our knowledge continues to grow and during the course of time more safety data has become available that helps us to develop better gene therapy approaches. Also, with the increased understanding of molecular medicine, we have been able to develop more specific and efficient gene transfer vectors which are now producing clinical results. In this review, we will take a historical view and highlight some of the milestones that had an important impact on the development of gene therapy.

OBJECTIVES: We sought to characterize the frequency and features of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) in patients with ADA deficiency. METHODS: Clinical and laboratory features of all patients with SCID caused by ADA deficiency in a single center were analyzed. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and lung biopsy specimens were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and periodic acid-Schiff, visualized by means of electron microscopy, and studied for associated infections. As a control group, BAL fluid and biopsy specimens from 22 patients with SCID caused by other genetic abnormalities were similarly assessed. RESULTS: Among 16 consecutive patients with ADA deficiency, 7 had BAL fluid containing periodic acid-Schiff-positive surfactant-like material with macrophages engulfing degenerating lamellar bodies and/or lung biopsy specimens with alveolar spaces filled with homogeneous granular eosinophilic material and large macrophages. The lung pathology was typical of PAP. Identification of various pathogens coincided with PAP in 3 of these patients. We have diagnosed PAP among patients with ADA deficiency more commonly in the last 10 years than previously (P= .05), likely reflecting increased awareness of this condition. There were no significant differences in the clinical or immunologic characteristics between patients with ADA deficiency with or without PAP. Similar findings of PAP were not found among patients with SCID caused by other genetic abnormalities (P= .001). ADA coupled to polyethylene glycol or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation rapidly corrected this pulmonary complication. PAP seems to have contributed to the death of only 1 patient with ADA deficiency. CONCLUSIONS: ADA deficiency predisposes to the development of PAP, which could be reversed after enzyme replacement or transplantation.",
