10587981		Gene therapy of diseaseD030342 and diseaseD009369.The scope of gene transfer applications in 9606 therapy has expanded enormously over the last 15 years to include not only several types of diseaseD030342 but also a variety of genetic approaches to the treatment of diseaseD009369. Hematopoietic stem cells have been considered excellent targets for therapeutic gene transfer because of their capacity for self-renewal and for differentiation into multiple cellular lineages. Retrovirus-mediated gene transfer has been tested for treatment of diseases that specifically affect the hematopoietic system, such as diseaseC531816 and diseaseD006105. diseaseD006432 such as diseaseD005776, diseaseD008059 and diseaseD016532, diseaseD030342 that affect a broad range of tissue types, may also be amenable to treatment by gene transfer into hematopoietic cells, owing to the release of enzyme expressed in transduced cells with subsequent uptake by untransduced cells ("metabolic cross-correction"). Hematopoietic stem cells may also be targeted for introduction of drug-resistance genes for the purpose of protecting normal tissues from the toxic side-effects of diseaseD009369 chemotherapeutic agents, thus allowing more effective antitumor chemotherapy. The danger of introducing drug-resistance function into diseaseD009369 cells may be dealt with by including sequences specifically designed to reduce expression of oncogenes or to restore expression of diseaseD009369 suppressor genes. Current limitations on the efficiency of gene transfer into hematopoietic stem cells may be alleviated by the development of new vector systems such as adeno-associated virus or lentivirus vectors, or by advances in cell processing that render hematopoietic cells more susceptible to transduction. Drug-resistance genes may also be applied for in vivo selection to expand the representation of a small proportion of transduced hematopoietic cells. These approaches toward increasing the frequency of hematopoietic cell transduction contribute to the anticipated feasibility of gene therapy for diseaseD030342 and diseaseD009369.
24794685	Association|diseaseD016511|ncbi3718	Host natural killer immunity is a key indicator of permissiveness for donor cell engraftment in 9606 with diseaseD016511.BACKGROUND: diseaseD016511 (diseaseD016511) can be cured by using allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and the absence of host immunity often obviates the need for preconditioning. Depending on the underlying diseaseD030342 and when blocks in differentiation occur during lymphocyte ontogeny, infants with diseaseD016511 have absent or greatly reduced numbers of functional T cells. Natural killer (NK) cell populations are usually absent in the diseaseD016511 and ncbi3718 forms of diseaseD016511 and greatly reduced in diseaseC531816 diseaseD016511 but often present in other forms of the disorder. OBJECTIVE: To determine if diseaseD016511 phenotypes indicate host permissiveness to donor cell engraftment. METHODS: A retrospective data analysis considered whether host NK cells influenced donor T-cell engraftment, immune reconstitution, and long-term outcomes in children who had undergone nonconditioned allogeneic stem cell transplantation between 1990 and 2011 in the United Kingdom. Detailed analysis of T- and B-cell immune reconstitution and donor chimerism was compared between the NK(+) (n = 24) and NK(-) (n = 53) forms of diseaseD016511. RESULTS: Overall, 77 children underwent transplantation, with survival of 90% in matched sibling donor/matched family donor transplants compared with 60% when alternative donors were used. Infants with NK(-)diseaseD016511 were more likely to survive than NK(+) recipients (87% vs 62%, P < .01) and had high-level donor T-cell chimerism with superior long-term recovery of ncbi920 T-cell immunity. Notably, 33% of children with NK(+)diseaseD016511 required additional transplantation procedures compared with only 8% of children with NK(-)diseaseD016511 (P < .005). CONCLUSIONS: NK(-)diseaseD016511 disorders are highly permissive for donor T-cell engraftment without preconditioning, whereas the presence of NK cells is a strong indicator that preparative conditioning is required for engraftment of T-cell precursors capable of supporting robust T-cell reconstitution.
19895994	Association|diseaseD016511|ncbi204	Outcomes of 9606 with diseaseD016511 treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with and without preconditioning.BACKGROUND: The effect of pretransplantation conditioning on the long-term outcomes of 9606 receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for diseaseD016511 (diseaseD016511) has not been completely determined. OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess the outcomes of 23 mostly conditioned 9606 with diseaseD016511 and compare their outcomes with those of 25 previously reported nonconditioned 9606 with diseaseD016511 who underwent transplantation. METHODS: In the present study we reviewed the medical records of these 23 consecutive, mostly conditioned 9606 with diseaseD016511 who underwent transplantation between 1998 and 2007. RESULTS: Eighteen 9606 (median age at transplantation, 10 months; range, 0.8-108 months) received haploidentical mismatched related donor, matched unrelated donor, or mismatched unrelated donor transplants, 17 of whom received pretransplantation conditioning (with 1 not conditioned); 13 (72%) 9606 engrafted with donor cells and survive at a median of 3.8 years (range, 1.8-9.8 year); 5 (38%) of 13 9606 require intravenous immunoglobulin; and 6 of 6 age-eligible children attend school. Of 5 recipients (median age at transplantation, 7 months; range, 2-23 months) of matched related donor transplants, all 5 engrafted and survive at a median of 7.5 years (range, 1.5-9.5 year), 1 recipient requires intravenous immunoglobulin, and 3 of 3 age-eligible children attend school. Gene mutations were known in 16 cases: mutation in the common gamma chain of the IL-2 receptor (ncbi3561) in 7 9606, mutation in the alpha chain of the IL-7 receptor (ncbi3575) in 4 9606, mutation in the recombinase-activating gene (ncbi5896) in 2 9606, diseaseC531816 (diseaseC531816) in 2 9606, and ncbi204 (ncbi204) in 1 9606. Early outcomes and quality of life of the previous nonconditioned versus the present conditioned cohorts were not statistically different, but longer-term follow-up is necessary for confirmation. CONCLUSIONS: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in 9606 with diseaseD016511 results in engraftment, long-term survival, and a good quality of life for the majority of 9606 with or without pretransplantation conditioning.

METHODS: We infused autologous CD34+ bone marrow cells transduced with a retroviral vector containing the ncbi100 gene into 10 children with diseaseD016511 due to diseaseC531816 who lacked an HLA-identical sibling donor, after nonmyeloablative conditioning with chemicalD002066. Enzyme-replacement therapy was not given after infusion of the cells. RESULTS: All 9606 are alive after a median follow-up of 4.0 years (range, 1.8 to 8.0). Transduced hematopoietic stem cells have stably engrafted and differentiated into myeloid cells containing ncbi100 (mean range at 1 year in bone marrow lineages, 3.5 to 8.9%) and lymphoid cells (mean range in peripheral blood, 52.4 to 88.0%). Eight 9606 do not require enzyme-replacement therapy, their blood cells continue to express ncbi100, and they have no signs of defective detoxification of chemicalC030985 metabolites. Nine 9606 had immune reconstitution with increases in T-cell counts (median count at 3 years, 1.07x10(9) per liter) and normalization of T-cell function. In the five 9606 in whom intravenous immune globulin replacement was discontinued, antigen-specific antibody responses were elicited after exposure to vaccines or viral antigens. Effective protection against diseaseD007239 and improvement in physical development made a normal lifestyle possible. Serious adverse events included diseaseD008133 (in two 9606), diseaseD006973 (in one), central-venous-catheter-related diseaseD007239 (in two), 10376 reactivation (in one), and diseaseD019693 (in one). CONCLUSIONS: Gene therapy, combined with reduced-intensity conditioning, is a safe and effective treatment for diseaseD016511 in 9606 with diseaseC531816.

From what was once a uniformly fatal disease, the prognosis for infants with diseaseC531816 has improved greatly based on the development of multiple therapeutic options, coupled with more frequent early diagnosis due to implementation of newborn screening for diseaseD053632. We review the various treatment approaches for diseaseC531816 including allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from a 9606 leukocyte antigen-matched sibling or family member or from a matched unrelated donor or a haplo-identical donor, autologous HSCT with gene correction of the hematopoietic stem cells (gene therapy-GT), and enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with chemicalD011092-conjugated ncbi100. Based on growing evidence of safety and efficacy from GT, we propose a treatment algorithm for 9606 with diseaseC531816 that recommends HSCT from a matched family donor, when available, as a first choice, followed by GT as the next option, with allogeneic HSCT from an unrelated or haplo-identical donor or long-term ERT as other options.

METHODS: With case report and review of literature, the background knowledge, clinical and laboratory findings, diagnosis and treatment of diseaseC531816 were discussed. RESULTS: The 9606 had the condition with diseaseD005183. The main complaint was more than three weeks of diseaseD005334 and diseaseD005076. He had received the live attenuated Oka strain diseaseD002644 vaccination approximately two weeks before the onset of diseaseD005076. diseaseD002644 was confirmed with direct immunofluorescence assay. The 9606 had mild diseaseD007970, with 3% lymphocytes. The initial immunologic workup included decreased IgG, IgM and ncbi973, abnormal expanded lymphocyte enumeration which confirmed the reduction of CD3, ncbi920, ncbi925, ncbi930 and ncbi4684. Enzyme testing for ADA activity showed remarkably low level in the hemolysate, as well as increased levels of deoxyadenosine nucleotides. CONCLUSION: diseaseC531816 has some characteristic clinical and laboratory findings. Management options for diseaseC531816 include hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, enzyme replacement therapy and gene therapy. diseaseD007153 should be considered in children with severe diseaseD005183. Live vaccine administration should be avoided in 9606 with diseaseD007153.
9857368		Towards gene therapy for the central nervous system.Gene therapy has generated enormous scientific, medical and public interest over the last decade. Clinical trials involving approximately 2000 9606 worldwide have targeted simple diseaseD030342 such as diseaseD003550, diseaseD009136, diseaseC531816, diseaseD005776 and diseaseD006938, as well as complex diseaseD003638 diseases such as diseaseD009369 and diseaseD000163. The central nervous system is a new and particularly exciting target for gene therapy because its unique properties prevent the successful treatment of many diseaseD009461 by conventional means. This review discusses the potential applications of in vivo gene therapy to diseaseD009461 that have the greatest potential for genetic treatments.

Recently, diseaseC531816 has been successfully treated using lentiviral-transduced autologous ncbi947+ cells carrying the ADA gene. T and B cell function appears to be fully restored, but in many 9606' B cell numbers remain low, and assessments of the immunoglobulin heavy (IgHV) repertoire following gene therapy are lacking. METHODS: We performed deep sequencing of IgHV repertoire in peripheral blood lymphocytes from a child following lentivirus-based gene therapy for diseaseC531816 and compared to the IgHV repertoire in healthy infants and adults. RESULTS: After gene therapy, Ig diversity increased over time as evidenced by V, D, and J gene usage, N-additions, CDR3 length, extent of somatic hypermutation, and Ig class switching. There was the emergence of predominant ncbi3507, IgHG, and IgHA CDR3 lengths after gene therapy indicating successful oligoclonal expansion in response to antigens. This provides proof of concept for the feasibility and utility of molecular monitoring in following B cell reconstitution following gene therapy for diseaseC531816. CONCLUSION: Based on deep sequencing, gene therapy resulted in an IgHV repertoire with molecular diversity similar to healthy infants.

If treatment is indicated, the majority of 9606 respond to immune-modulation by intravenous immunoglobulin G infusion or systemic corticosteroids. Differential diagnoses to childhood diseaseD016553 includes diseaseD013921 due to diseaseD007239, drugs, diseaseD020763, disease614878, and inherited diseaseD000080983, for example, diseaseC535982. Isolated diseaseD013921 in an otherwise healthy appearing child that recurs after therapy and/or persists suggest a differential diagnosis rather than diseaseD016553.

However, this may result in low donor stem cell chimerism, leading to reduced long-term immune reconstitution. We compared engraftment, metabolic, and T-cell and B-cell immune reconstitution of HLA-identical sibling bone marrow transplantation performed in 2 diseaseD016511 infants with diseaseC531816 from the same family treated with or without a reduced intensity conditioning regimen (chemicalD002066/chemicalC024352). Only the 9606 who received conditioning showed a stable mixed chimerism in all lineages, including bone marrow myeloid and B cells. The use of conditioning resulted in higher thymus-derived naive T cells and T-cell receptor excision circles, normalization of the T-cell repertoire, and faster and complete B-cell and metabolic reconstitution. These results suggest the utility of exploring the use of reduced intensity conditioning in bone marrow transplantation from HLA-identical donor in diseaseD016511 to improve long-term immune reconstitution.

20039061		Late-onset diseaseC531816 presenting with diseaseD017573.diseaseD017573, also known as diseaseD017573, is a rare but distinctive entity of viral etiology with characteristic clinical and histopathological features. It is a benign, asymptomatic disease of the oral mucosa caused by human papilloma viruses (HPV). Previous studies postulated an association between these lesions and diseaseD007153. Genetic diseaseC531816 (diseaseC531816) results in varying degrees of diseaseD007153, including diseaseD016511 (diseaseC531816), and milder, later onset diseaseD007153. We report a 12-year-old girl with the late onset-diseaseC531816 presenting with diseaseD017573. Our case report should draw attention to the possibility of diseaseD007153 in 9606 with HPV-induced diseaseD017573.

METHODS: The diseaseC531816 diagnosis was performed with biochemical, immunological and molecular techniques. Ten 9606 treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and three in treatment with enzyme replacement were followed up in our center. RESULTS: Twenty-four different mutations were identified and five were not previously reported. Identical mutations were found among 9606 from the same Romani ethnic group or from the same geographical region. A more rapid recovery was observed in enzyme replacement treated 9606 in comparison with those transplanted that, however, showed a continuous and long-lasting improvement both in terms of immune and metabolic recovery. CONCLUSION: The data obtained in our single center are comparable with those that have been reported in multicenter surveys.

In the last decade, gene therapy has been developed as an alternative for these conditions. We summarize the recent advances in gene therapy for diseaseD000081207 and discuss the unexpected occurrence of diseaseD007938 in a gene therapy trial for diseaseD053632. RECENT FINDINGS: Eight of 10 infants with diseaseD053632 who received autologous hematopoietic stem cells transduced with a retroviral vector carrying the ncbi3561 complementary DNA achieved immune reconstitution. However, the two youngest 9606 developed diseaseD007938 expansions of gene-corrected cells. The first case had proliferation of a gamma delta T cell clone, and the second case had three alpha beta T cell clones derived from a single transduced progenitor. diseaseD007938 cells in both 9606 aberrantly expressed the LIM domain only-2 transcription factor due to retroviral vector insertions in this locus. After receiving anti-diseaseD007938 treatment one 9606 achieved a lasting remission, but the other relapsed. Four ncbi100 deficient diseaseD016511 9606 also developed functional immunity after receiving autologous hematopoietic stem cells transduced with the ncbi100 gene complementary DNA following submyeloablative chemotherapy. diseaseD006105, diseaseD014923, diseaseD007153 and diseaseD007153 are other diseaseD007153 being studied as candidates for gene therapy. SUMMARY: Gene therapy is a promising therapeutic option for some diseaseD000081207, especially when cells expressing the correct gene have a selective advantage. More clinical trials with closer 9606 monitoring are under way to define which 9606 may benefit from this approach, and strategies are being developed to understand and ultimately reduce the risk of diseaseD007938 secondary to retroviral vector insertion.
24823313		Gene therapy for diseaseD000081207.INTRODUCTION: During the last decade, gene therapy has emerged as a convincing therapy for diseaseD000081207 (diseaseD000081207). Ex vivo gene transfer into autologous hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) via viral vectors permits sustained correction of T cell diseaseD007153 in two forms of diseaseD016511: diseaseD053632 (diseaseD053632) (diseaseD006362) and diseaseC531816. However, this success has been balanced by the occurrence of genotoxicity generated by the integration of first-generation retroviral vectors. Recently, the development of safer self-inactivating vectors has led to the initiation of new studies with the hope of equivalent efficacy and a better safety profile. AREAS COVERED: This review article focuses on the updated results of gene therapy trials for diseaseD000081207 - from early studies to ongoing clinical trials. We detail the major advances made in gene transfer and repair technologies, and discuss the many ways to extend our present experience. EXPERT OPINION: With optimization in terms of safety and efficacy, gene therapy by lentiviral transduction could become a compelling alternative to allogeneic HSC transplantation, and thus may take center stage in the management of diseaseD000081207 in coming years.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate ncbi3565 production and ncbi959 expression by 9606 ncbi925(+) T cells. METHODS: We conducted functional and phenotypic analyses of 9606 T cells in peritoneal washings from diseaseD016511 10090 reconstituted with PBMCs from normal and atopic 9606 donors. We also examined the expression of ncbi3565 and ncbi959 by ncbi925(+) T cells from a 9606 with diseaseC531816 who received autologous T cell-directed gene therapy. RESULTS: Transfer of atopic cells into the 10090 caused production of ncbi3497 and IgG with increased expression of ncbi3565 and ncbi959 mRNA. In addition, both intracellular ncbi3565 and cell surface ncbi959 were detected in ncbi925(+) and in ncbi920(+) T cells. ncbi925(+) T-cell lines generated from the 9606's T cells carrying the ncbi100 gene expressed not only ncbi3565 mRNA and protein but also ncbi959 mRNA and protein after being stimulated with an anti-CD3 mAb. After anti-CD3 stimulation and chemicalC003043 fixation, ncbi925(+) T cells induced ncbi3497 synthesis by normal 9606 B cells in the presence of recombinant ncbi3565. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these results demonstrate that ncbi3565-producing and ncbi959-expressing ncbi925(+) cells are detectable among 9606 T cells and suggest that such cells may promote ncbi3497 production by B cells under some conditions.
10908569		The use of enzyme therapy to regulate the diseaseD008659 and phenotypic consequences of diseaseC531816 in 10090. Differential impact on diseaseD007153.diseaseC531816 results in a combined diseaseD007153 brought about by the immunotoxic properties of elevated ADA substrates. Additional diseaseD008228 are associated with diseaseC531816, however, little is known about how these relate to the diseaseD008659 consequences of diseaseC531816. ADA-deficient 10090 develop a combined diseaseD007153 as well as severe diseaseD011665. ADA enzyme therapy was used to examine the relative impact of ADA substrate elevations on these phenotypes. A "low-dose" enzyme therapy protocol prevented the pulmonary phenotype seen in ADA-deficient 10090, but did little to improve their immune status. This treatment protocol reduced diseaseD008659 disturbances in the circulation and lung, but not in the thymus and spleen. A "high-dose" enzyme therapy protocol resulted in decreased diseaseD008659 disturbances in the thymus and spleen and was associated with improvement in immune status. These findings suggest that the pulmonary and immune phenotypes are separable and are related to the severity of diseaseD008659 disturbances in these tissues. This model will be useful in examining the efficacy of ADA enzyme therapy and studying the mechanisms underlying the diseaseD007153 and pulmonary phenotypes associated with diseaseC531816.

This review describes the latest advances in gene therapy trials for this condition using peripheral blood lymphocytes or hematopoietic progenitors. RECENT FINDINGS: In the first 9606 with diseaseD016511 due to diseaseC531816 treated with peripheral blood lymphocytes, transduced T cells have been shown to persist for over 10 years, expressing transgenic ncbi100, but the therapeutic effect of gene therapy remained difficult to assess because of the concomitant treatment with 9913 ncbi280712 conjugated to chemicalD011092 (PEG-ADA). A recent report showed that discontinuation of PEG-ADA resulted in a strong selective advantage of gene corrected T cells associated with restoration of T cell functions and antibody responses to neoantigen, but incomplete correction of the metabolic defect. Follow-up studies in 9606 treated with engineered hematopoietic progenitors in the early trials revealed low marking levels of long-term living progenitors and limited clinical effect. Recently, an improved gene transfer protocol in bone marrow ncbi947+ cells combined with low-dose chemicalD002066 resulted in multilineage, stable engraftment of transduced progenitors at substantial levels, restoration of immune functions, correction of the ncbi100 metabolic defect, and proven clinical benefit, in the absence of PEG-ADA. Overall, no adverse effect or diseaseD064420 has been observed in 9606 treated with ncbi100 gene transfer in mature lymphocytes or hematopoietic progenitors. SUMMARY: Gene transfer in hematopoietic stem cells combined with nonmyeloablative conditioning is efficacious and might be extended to the treatment of other diseaseD030342 of the hematopoietic system.
27750026		Gene Therapy with Hematopoietic Stem Cells: The Diseased Bone Marrow's Point of View.When considering diseaseD030342 that can be treated by gene transfer into hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), there are only two in which the HSC and progenitor cell distribution inside the bone marrow and its microenvironment are exactly the same as in a healthy subject: diseaseD007966 (diseaseD007966) and diseaseD000326 (diseaseD000326). In all other settings [diseaseD053632 (diseaseD053632), diseaseC531816, diseaseD014923, and diseaseD006453], the bone marrow content of the different stem and precursor cells and the cells' relationship with the stroma have very specific characteristics. These peculiarities can influence the cells' harvesting and behavior in culture, and the postgraft uptake and further behavior of the gene-modified hematopoietic/precursor cells. In the present mini-review, we shall briefly summarize these characteristics and outline the possible consequences and challenges.
28895850		Gene Therapy Approaches to diseaseD007153.Transfer of gene-corrected autologous hematopoietic stem cells in 9606 with diseaseD000081207 has emerged as a new therapeutic approach. 9606 with various conditions lacking a suitable donor have been treated with retroviral vectors and a gene-addition strategy. Initial promising results were shadowed by the occurrence of diseaseD009369 in some of these 9606. Current trials, developed in the last decade, use safer viral vectors to overcome the risk of genotoxicity and have led to improved clinical outcomes. This review reflects the progresses made in specific disorders, including diseaseC531816, diseaseD053632, diseaseD006105, and diseaseD014923.
27129325		Update on the safety and efficacy of retroviral gene therapy for diseaseD007153 due to diseaseC531816.diseaseC531816 is a rare, diseaseD001928 characterized by diseaseD016511 (diseaseD016511). The treatment of choice for diseaseC531816 (diseaseC531816) is hematopoietic stem cell transplant from an HLA-matched sibling donor, although <25% of 9606 have such a donor available. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) partially and temporarily relieves diseaseD007153. We investigated the medium-term outcome of gene therapy (GT) in 18 9606 with diseaseC531816 for whom an HLA-identical family donor was not available; most were not responding well to ERT. 9606 were treated with an autologous ncbi947(+)-enriched cell fraction that contained ncbi947(+) cells transduced with a retroviral vector encoding the 9606 ADA complementary DNA sequence (GSK2696273) as part of single-arm, open-label studies or compassionate use programs. Overall survival was 100% over 2.3 to 13.4 years (median, 6.9 years). Gene-modified cells were stably present in multiple lineages throughout follow up. GT resulted in a sustained reduction in the severe diseaseD007239 rate from 1.17 events per person-year to 0.17 events per person-year (n = 17, 9606 1 data not available). Immune reconstitution was demonstrated by normalization of T-cell subsets (CD3(+), ncbi920(+), and ncbi925(+)), evidence of thymopoiesis, and sustained T-cell proliferative capacity. B-cell function was evidenced by immunoglobulin production, decreased intravenous immunoglobulin use, and antibody response after vaccination. All 18 9606 reported diseaseD007239 as adverse events; diseaseD012141 were reported most frequently. No events indicative of diseaseD002472 were reported. Trial details were registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00598481.
18221464		diseaseD016511: a national surveillance study.National diseaseD007153 registers in several countries have reported prevalence but not incidence rates for diseaseD016511 (diseaseD016511). The objective of this study was to document the incidence and type of diseaseD016511 in Australia, the age and clinical features at presentation and short-term management. The Australian Paediatric Surveillance Unit conducts active, monthly, national surveillance of diseaseD035583 with reporting by child-health specialists. Between May 1995 and December 2001, clinicians provided clinical and laboratory data on children newly diagnosed with diseaseD016511. Thirty-three incident cases of diseaseD016511 were identified [incidence 1.8/10(5) live births per annum; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-2.5]. Twenty-six children had classical diseaseD016511 (1.45/10(5) live births; 95% CI, 0.9-2.0) and 20 (77%) of these were boys. Classical diseaseD016511 was X-linked in 13 children, autosomal recessive (AR), not further classified in four, and attributed to diseaseC531816 (diseaseC531816) in four, interleukin-7 receptor alpha chain deficiency in one, diseaseD013577 in two, and diseaseD003643 in two. Twenty-one (81%) received bone marrow/stem cell transplantation, three of whom diseaseD003643 between 1 and 4 months after transplantation (two diseaseC531816, one AR). Seven children had atypical diseaseD016511, five of whom diseaseD003643 within 1-4 yr of diagnosis. Most children with diseaseD016511 presented with diseaseD005183 and recurrent infections and there was no significant delay between presentation and diagnosis. The reported national incidence of classical diseaseD016511 in Australia (1.45/10(5) or approximately 4 cases per year or 1/69,000 live births) is consistent with the rate (1.4/10(5)) previously reported in Victoria. Diagnosis is rarely delayed, and transplantation is associated with good short-term survival.

10774451		Gene therapy for diseaseC531816.The clinical gene therapy trials for diseaseC531816 have defined both the potential benefits and the present limitations of gene therapy with hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). Current clinical results indicate that (a) both umbilical cord blood and neonatal bone marrow HSC can be transduced with 10090 retroviral-based vectors, (b) the transduced HSC can engraft in nonmyeloablated 9606, (c) the frequency of HSC transduction/engraftment is low (1/10,000), (d) an in vivo selective advantage can exist for transduced T lymphoid progeny, and (e) the transduced ADA gene is not expressed in nondividing T lymphocytes. Improving the clinical results of gene therapy for diseaseC531816 and other diseaseD030342 involving HSC will require (a) developing new vectors that express the transduced gene in nondividing cells and (b) increasing the frequency of stable HSC transduction.
18691744		Disease-specific induced pluripotent stem cells.Tissue culture of immortal cell strains from diseased 9606 is an invaluable resource for medical research but is largely limited to diseaseD009369 cell lines or transformed derivatives of native tissues. Here we describe the generation of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells from 9606 with a variety of diseaseD030342 with either Mendelian or complex inheritance; these diseases include diseaseC531816-related diseaseD016511 (diseaseC531816), diseaseD000081003 (diseaseD000081003), diseaseD005776, diseaseD020388 (diseaseD020388) and diseaseD020388 (diseaseD020388), diseaseD010300 (diseaseD010300), diseaseD006816 (diseaseD006816), diseaseD003922 (JDM), diseaseD004314 (diseaseD004314)/diseaseD004314, and the carrier state of diseaseD007926. Such disease-specific stem cells offer an unprecedented opportunity to recapitulate both normal and pathologic 9606 tissue formation in vitro, thereby enabling disease investigation and drug development.
26682746	Positive_Correlation|chemicalD000241|diseaseD011660	Impulse oscillometry identifies peripheral diseaseD000402 in children with diseaseC531816.diseaseC531816 (diseaseC531816) is characterized by impaired T-, B- and NK-cell function. Affected children, in addition to early onset of diseaseD007239, manifest non-immunologic symptoms including diseaseD011660 likely attributable to elevated systemic chemicalD000241 levels. diseaseD008171 assessment has primarily employed repetitive radiography and effort-dependent functional studies. Through impulse oscillometry (IOS), which is effort-independent, we prospectively obtained objective measures of diseaseD008171 in 10 children with diseaseC531816. These results support the use of IOS in the identification and monitoring of diseaseD008171 in children with diseaseD000081207.

It results in the intracellular accumulation of toxic metabolites which have effects particularly on lymphocytes and the brain. The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcome of 13 diseaseC531816 9606. We planned to evaluate their clinical and laboratory findings before and after enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (diseaseD019337), and hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy (diseaseD019337). METHODS: Measurement of ncbi100 enzyme activity and metabolites and sequencing of the ncbi100 gene were performed in most of the 9606 with diseaseC531816. One of the 9606 with late-onset diseaseC531816 was diagnosed by the help of diseaseD000081207 panel screening. RESULTS: Ten out of 13 9606 were diagnosed as diseaseD053632, while 3 out of 13 were diagnosed as delayed-/late-onset diseaseC531816. Late-onset diseaseC531816 9606 had clinical and laboratory findings of diseaseD053632 (diseaseD053632). Eight 9606 with diseaseC531816 were found to have higher levels of ncbi100 metabolite (dAXP%) (62.1% (34.6-71.9)) than 3 9606 with delayed-/late-onset diseaseC531816 (6.9% (2.1-8.9). All but one 9606 with diseaseD053632 had T-B-NK- phenotype, one had T-B-NK+ phenotype. diseaseD030342 was documented in 11 9606. Four out of 11 9606 had compound heterozygous defects. Three out of 4 9606 with compound heterozygous defects had delayed-onset/late-onset diseaseC531816. Seven out of 11 9606 with diseaseD053632 had homozygous defects. Five out of 7 had the same homozygous indel frameshift mutation (variant#100#c.955_959delGAAGA) showing a founder effect. There were two novel splice site defects: one (variant#100#c.IVS10+2T>C) was heterozygous in a 9606 with late-onset diseaseC531816, and the other was homozygous (variant#100#c.IVS2delT+2) in a diseaseD053632 9606. Other defects were missense defects. Nine out of 13 9606 were put on pegylated ncbi100 ERT. Four out of six 9606 were transplanted without using a conditioning regimen. diseaseD019337 was performed to one of the 9606. CONCLUSION: The genetic diagnosis of diseaseD053632 is utmost important. There is a chance to give ERT before the definitive therapy if the 9606 with diseaseD053632/diseaseD053632 has diseaseC531816. Although ERT was insufficient to restore a normal immune function in diseaseC531816 9606, it was useful to improve and stabilize the clinical status before curative therapy (diseaseD019337/diseaseD019337). Enzyme replacement therapy was successful in 9606 with late-/delayed-onset diseaseC531816 who presented with the features of diseaseD053632. diseaseD005767 in a 9606 with late-onset diseaseC531816 may be an association or a coincidental finding. Intermittent neurodevelopmental evaluation especially for diseaseD034381 should be performed in most of the diseaseC531816 9606. This may alleviate the diseaseD007805 and diseaseD060825 which may be observed in the follow-up.
33974366		Autologous Ex Vivo Lentiviral Gene Therapy for diseaseC531816.BACKGROUND: diseaseD016511 due to diseaseC531816 (diseaseC531816) is a rare and life-threatening diseaseD000081207. METHODS: We treated 50 9606 with diseaseC531816 (30 in the United States and 20 in the United Kingdom) with an investigational gene therapy composed of autologous CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) transduced ex vivo with a self-inactivating lentiviral vector encoding 9606 ADA. Data from the two U.S. studies (in which fresh and cryopreserved formulations were used) at 24 months of follow-up were analyzed alongside data from the U.K. study (in which a fresh formulation was used) at 36 months of follow-up. RESULTS: Overall survival was 100% in all studies up to 24 and 36 months. Event-free survival (in the absence of reinitiation of enzyme-replacement therapy or rescue allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation) was 97% (U.S. studies) and 100% (U.K. study) at 12 months; 97% and 95%, respectively, at 24 months; and 95% (U.K. study) at 36 months. Engraftment of genetically modified HSPCs persisted in 29 of 30 9606 in the U.S. studies and in 19 of 20 9606 in the U.K. study. 9606 had sustained metabolic detoxification and normalization of ADA activity levels. Immune reconstitution was robust, with 90% of the 9606 in the U.S. studies and 100% of those in the U.K. study discontinuing immunoglobulin-replacement therapy by 24 months and 36 months, respectively. No evidence of monoclonal expansion, diseaseD008107, or emergence of replication-competent lentivirus was noted, and no events of autoimmunity or diseaseD006086 occurred. Most adverse events were of low grade. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of diseaseC531816 with ex vivo lentiviral HSPC gene therapy resulted in high overall and event-free survival with sustained ADA expression, metabolic correction, and functional immune reconstitution.

11060694		diseaseC531816 as the first target disorder in gene therapy.In the past decade, the advent of gene therapy has been acclaimed as a revolutionary medical intervention, embraced with great enthusiasm. However, recent disappointing results of the considerable clinical trials have also clearly demonstrated that such an initial expectation was an overestimation of gene therapy. There are only a few successful cases despite the 3000 9606 who have been treated with various forms of gene therapy. Gene therapy for diseaseD016511 (diseaseD016511) caused by diseaseC531816 is one of the few such cases where results have been promising. In particular, peripheral T-lymphocytes-directed gene therapy provides further immunological improvements for 9606 with diseaseC531816 receiving the PEG-ADA treatment whereas gene therapy targeting haematopoietic stem cell has so far proved insufficient for clinical benefits. This report will review crucial problems elucidated in the past five clinical trials for diseaseC531816 and gives an outline of the next generation of stem cell gene therapy in Japan.
21057082	Negative_Correlation|ncbi100|ncbi930; Association|diseaseD053632|ncbi100	The different extent of B and T cell immune reconstitution after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and enzyme replacement therapies in diseaseD053632 9606 with diseaseC531816.The lack of ncbi100 (ncbi100) leads to the accumulation of toxic metabolites, resulting in diseaseD053632. If the disease is left untreated, it is likely to have a fatal outcome in early infancy. Because hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and enzyme replacement therapy with pegylated bovine ncbi100 (PEG-ncbi100) are both provided in our hospital, we undertook a retrospective longitudinal comparative study of the extent of lymphocyte recovery in two groups of treated ncbi100-diseaseD053632 children. Together with classical immunological parameters, we quantified the output of the new B and T cells from the production sites using the kappa-deleting recombination excision circle and ncbi6962 excision circle assay, and we monitored T cell repertoire diversification. We found that immune reconstitution was different following the two treatments. The stable production of kappa-deleting recombination excision circle(+) lymphocytes sustained an increase in B cell number in HSCT-treated 9606, whereas in PEG-ncbi100-treated 9606, it was accompanied by a significant and progressive decrease in circulating ncbi930(+) lymphocytes, which never reached the levels observed in age-matched children. The mobilization of ncbi6962 excision circle(+) cells, though lower than in controls, was stable with time after HSCT treatment, leading to a constant peripheral T cell number and to the diversification of the T cell repertoire; however, it was compromised in children receiving prolonged PEG-ncbi100 therapy, whose T cells showed progressively narrowing T cell repertoires.

More than 90% of transduced cells cultured for 7-11 days before infusion into the 9606 were positive for ncbi925 and expressed Th2-type cytokine genes such as ncbi3565, ncbi3567 and ncbi3596. Furthermore, ncbi920(+) T-depleted PBMC (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) from the 9606 synthesized ncbi3497 in vitro by stimulation with ncbi3565. Collectively, these results suggested that Tc2-like cells in the transduced cells have distinct immunological functions to help ncbi3497 synthesis and activate eosinophils.
20493398		Bone marrow transplantation and alternatives for diseaseC531816.diseaseC531816 diseaseD016511 (diseaseD016511) comprises approximately 10% to 15% of all cases of diseaseD016511. The clinical effects of diseaseC531816 are manifest most dramatically in the immune system, where it leads to severe diseaseD008231. Although hematopoietic stem cell transplantation remains the mainstay of treatment for ADA-deficient diseaseD016511, 2 other treatment options are available, namely enzyme replacement therapy with PEG-ADA and autologous hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy. In this article the author reviews the available data on treatment by these different options, and offers an overview on when each of the different treatment options should be used.
24488786		Gene transfer into hematopoietic stem cells as treatment for diseaseD000081207.Gene transfer into the hematopoietic stem cell has shown curative potential for a variety of diseaseD006402. diseaseD000081207 have led to the way in this field of gene therapy as an example and a model. Clinical results from the past 15 years have shown that significant improvement and even cure can be achieved for diseases such as diseaseD053632, diseaseC531816, diseaseD006105 and diseaseD014923. Unfortunately, with the initial clear clinical benefits, the first serious complications of gene therapy have also occurred. In a significant number of 9606 treated using vectors based on 10090 gamma-retroviruses and carrying powerful viral enhancer elements, insertional oncogenesis events have resulted in diseaseD015470 that, in some cases, have had fatal outcomes. These serious adverse events have sparked a revision of the assessment of risks and benefits of integrating gene transfer for diseaseD006402 and prompted the development and application of new generations of viral vectors with recognized superior safety characteristics. This review summarizes the clinical experience of gene therapy for diseaseD000081207 and discusses the likely avenues of progress in the future development of this expanding field of clinical investigations.
18597656	Association|diseaseC531816|ncbi100	Towards a rAAV-based gene therapy for diseaseC531816: from diseaseC531816 to current and future treatment strategies.diseaseC531816 fosters a rare, devastating pediatric diseaseD007154 with concomitant diseaseD009894, diseaseD008659 and multiple organ system pathology. The standard of care for diseaseC531816 (diseaseC531816) includes enzyme replacement therapy or bone marrow transplantation. Gene therapies for diseaseC531816 over nearly two decades have exclusively involved retroviral vectors targeted to lymphocytes and hematopoetic progenitors. These groundbreaking gene therapies represent a revolution in clinical medicine, but come with several challenges, including the risk of insertional mutagenesis. An alternative gene therapy for diseaseC531816 may utilize recombinant adeno-associated virus vectors in vivo, with numerous target tissues, to foster ectopic expression and secretion of ncbi100. This review endeavors to describe diseaseC531816, the traditional treatments, previous retroviral gene therapies, and primarily, alternative recombinant adeno-associated virus-based strategies to remedy this potentially fatal diseaseD030342.
36719776		Transamniotic Fetal Administration of Genetically Modified Hematopoietic Stem Cells Carrying a 9606 Transgene in a Syngeneic 10116 Model.Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-based gene therapy has already reached clinical reality in a few applications. Fetal administration of genetically modified HSCs has only been feasible to date through invasive and morbid methods. It has been recently shown that native donor HSCs can reach the fetal circulation and bone marrow after simple delivery into the amniotic fluid, at least in a syngeneic healthy model. We sought to determine whether the transamniotic route could also be a practical alternative for the fetal administration of genetically modified HSCs in a comparable model. Pregnant Lewis 10116 dams underwent volume-matched intra-amniotic injections in all their fetuses (n = 47) on gestational day 17 (E17; term = E21-22) of donor HSCs genetically modified using a custom lentiviral vector designed to constitutively express both a firefly luciferase reporter gene and a 9606 ncbi100 (ncbi100) transgene. Donor HSCs consisted of syngeneic cells isolated from the amniotic fluid and phenotyped by flow cytometry. Fetuses were euthanized at term, when seven select sites relevant to HSC-based therapies were screened for either luciferase activity by luminometry or for the presence of 9606 ncbi100 mRNA by digital droplet polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR). Among survivors (30/47; 64%), positive luminescence and positive 9606 ncbi100 expression were detected in the bone marrow (respectively, 33% and 76%), liver (respectively, 11% and 81%), spleen (respectively, 11% and 67%), thymus (respectively, 33% and 67%), lungs (respectively, 44% and 86%), and brain (respectively, 22% and 90%). Nucleated peripheral blood cells were analyzed only by ddPCR, showing positive 9606 ncbi100 expression at 54%. We conclude that genetically modified HSCs can reach the fetal circulation and fetal bone marrow after simple intra-amniotic administration in a syngeneic 10116 model. Gene therapy by transamniotic HSC delivery may become a practicable, minimally invasive strategy for the prenatal treatment of select diseaseD006453, diseaseD007153, and diseaseD020739.
28319446	Association|ncbi100|ncbi947; Association|diseaseC531816|ncbi947	Good Laboratory Practice Preclinical Safety Studies for GSK2696273 (MLV Vector-Based Ex Vivo Gene Therapy for diseaseC531816) in NSG 10090.GSK2696273 (autologous ncbi947+ cells transduced with retroviral vector that encodes for the 9606 ncbi100 [ncbi100] enzyme) is a gamma-retroviral ex vivo gene therapy of bone marrow-derived ncbi947+ cells for the treatment of diseaseC531816 (diseaseC531816). diseaseC531816 is a severe monogenic disease characterized by immunologic and nonimmunologic symptoms. Bone-marrow transplant from a matched related donor is the treatment of choice, but it is available for only a small proportion of 9606. Ex vivo gene therapy of 9606 bone-marrow ncbi947+ cells is an alternative treatment. In order to prepare for a marketing authorization application in the European Union, preclinical safety studies in 10090 were requested by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). A pilot study and a main biodistribution study were performed according to Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) at the San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy test facility. In the main study, 9606 umbilical cord blood (UCB)-derived ncbi947+ cells were transduced with gamma-retroviral vector used in the production of GSK2696273. Groups of 10 male and 10 female NOD-SCID gamma (NSG) 10090 were injected intravenously with a single dose of transduced- or mock-transduced UCB ncbi12490+ cells, and they were observed for 4 months. Engraftment and multilineage differentiation of blood cells was observed in the majority of animals in both groups. There was no significant difference in the level of chimerism between the two groups. In the gene therapy group, vector was detectable in lymphohemopoietic and nonlymphohemopoietic tissues, consistent with the presence of gene-modified 9606 hematopoietic donor cells. Given the absence of relevant safety concerns in the data, the nonclinical studies and the clinical experience with GSK2696273 supported a successful application for market authorization in the European Union for the treatment of diseaseC531816 9606, for whom no suitable 9606 leukocyte antigen-matched related donor is available.
15236670		Gene therapy for severe diseaseD016511.Infants born with severe diseaseD016511 are prone to life-threatening diseaseD007239 and, without treatment, do not survive beyond the first year of life. Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation from a fully matched donor offers the possibility of cure. In the absence of a suitable matched donor, haploidentical transplants from a parental donor may be undertaken, but these are associated with more complications and lower success rates. Recently, an alternative therapeutic option based on retroviral gene delivery has been used to correct diseaseD053632 (diseaseD053632) and diseaseC531816. Clinical trials have established that in situations where ex vivo gene transfer into haematopoietic progenitor cells confers a strong selective advantage, the procedure is a feasible alternative to haploidentical transplantation, with favourable kinetics of immune reconstitution.

With improved survival, the nonimmunologic manifestations of this condition are becoming apparent. We report a high incidence of diseaseD006312 in transplanted 9606, which highlights the systemic nature of the disease.
17928873		Generation of a high-titer packaging cell line for the production of retroviral vectors in suspension and serum-free media.Several 9606 with diseaseD016511 and diseaseC531816 have been cured by retroviral-mediated gene therapy. Despite the earlier success, the production of retroviral vectors for clinical gene therapy is cumbersome, costly and lacks safety features because of the adherent nature of packaging cells and the necessity to supplement the culture media with bovine serum. The aim of this study was to generate a retrovirus packaging cell line that could be used for the production of large clinical batch vectors. Bicistronic vectors containing an internal ribosomal entry site followed by a selection gene were used to express Moloney murine leukemia gag-pol and amphotropic envelope viral proteins in 0045 cells. The candidate clone (WI48) that was selected as the packaging cell line could release recombinant green fluorescent protein retroviruses at 4x10(7) infectious viral particles per ml. Similar titers were achieved after these cells were adapted to grow in suspension and serum-free media. Furthermore, using the same culture conditions viral titers proved to be stable for a 3-month culture period. The WI48 packaging cell line has the potential to be cultured in bioreactors, opening the possibility for large-scale use of retroviral vectors in late stage clinical trials.
9806008		[Gene therapy: a review 6 years after the first trials in man. Round Table No 6 at Giens XIII].The first protocol of gene therapy was started in 1990 for two children with diseaseC531816. In 1997, the field largely widened, with 2100 9606 treated: 10 per cent suffer from diseaseD030342, diseaseD003550 mainly, and 90 per cent acquired disease, mainly diseaseD009369 or diseaseD015658. No diseaseD064420 of gene therapy has been observed for the 9606 or their environment. A psychological barrier has been crossed which might allow an easing of the regulations. Industrial firms are heavily engaged in this field and are defining the rules of production and use. After in vivo administration to 9606, the gene is expressed but the vectorisation is still very weak. Gene therapy should thus be limited to indications with a well-established clinical and scientific rationale.
27289360		Current status of ex vivo gene therapy for diseaseD006402: a review of clinical trials in Japan around the world.Gene therapies are classified into two major categories, namely, in vivo and ex vivo. Clinical trials of 9606 gene therapy began with the ex vivo techniques. Based on the initial successes of gene-therapy clinical trials, these approaches have spread worldwide. The number of gene therapy trials approved worldwide increased gradually starting in 1989, reaching 116 protocols per year in 1999, and a total of 2210 protocols had been approved by 2015. Accumulating clinical evidence has demonstrated the safety and benefits of several types of gene therapy, with the exception of serious adverse events in several clinical trials. These diseaseD010146 experiences were translated backward to basic science, resulting in the development of several new technologies that have influenced the recent development of ex vivo gene therapy in this field. To date, six gene therapies have been approved in a limited number of countries worldwide. In Japan, clinical trials of gene therapy have developed under the strong influence of trials in the US and Europe. Since the initial stages, 50 clinical trials have been approved by the Japanese government. In this review, the history and current status of clinical trials of ex vivo gene therapy for diseaseD006402 are introduced and discussed.

23812072		[Current status and future prospects of stem cell gene therapy for diseaseD000081207].9606 affected by diseaseD000081207 (diseaseD000081207) can be cured by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). In the absence of HLA-matched donors, however, incidence of HSCT-related complications is observed. Therefore, gene therapy has been developed as a highly desirable alternative treatment for 9606 lacking suitable donors. Retrovirus-based gene therapy was begun in 1990 for the 9606 of diseaseC531816, followed by diseaseD053632, diseaseD014923 and diseaseD006105. Although treated 9606 have had excellent immune reconstitution and resolution of ongoing diseaseD007239, complications such as a diseaseD008232 and a disappearance of gene-modified cells were observed in some clinical trials. To overcome these, ongoing and upcoming clinical trials use some new strategies. The use of preconditioning chemotherapy makes space in the bone marrow for the gene-treated stem cells and allows engraftment of multi lineage stem/progenitor cells. Self-inactivating vectors in which strong enhancers of long terminal repeat are eliminated may reduce the risk of insertional activation of proto-oncogene resulting in diseaseD007938. These modifications will surely increase the safety and efficacy of stem cell gene therapy for diseaseD000081207.
16037821		Hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy with drug resistance genes: an update.Transfer of drug resistance genes into hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) has promise for the treatment of a variety of inherited, that is, diseaseD053632, diseaseC531816, diseaseD013789, and diseaseD007806, that is, diseaseD001943, diseaseD008223, diseaseD001932, and diseaseD013736. Drug resistance genes are transferred into HSCs either for providing myeloprotection against chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression or for selecting HSCs that are concomitantly transduced with another gene for correction of an diseaseD030342. In this review, we describe ongoing experimental approaches, observations from clinical trials, and safety concerns related to the drug resistance gene transfer.

The products of three of the genes--ncbi3561, ncbi3718, and ncbi3575--are components of cytokine receptors, and the products of three more-ncbi5896, ncbi5897, and Artemis-are essential for effecting antigen receptor gene rearrangement. Additionally, a deficiency of ncbi915, a component of the T-cell antigen receptor, results in a near absence of circulating mature CD3+ T cells and a complete lack of gamma/delta T cells. diseaseC531816 results in toxic accumulations of metabolites that cause T cell apoptosis. Finally, a deficiency of ncbi5788, a critical regulator of signaling thresholds in immune cells, also causes diseaseD053632. Approaches to immune reconstitution have included bone marrow transplantation and gene therapy. Bone marrow transplantation, both HLA identical unfractionated and T cell-depleted HLA haploidentical, has been very successful in effecting immune reconstitution if done in the first 3.5 months of life and without pretransplant chemotherapy. Gene therapy was highly successful in nine infants with diseaseD053632, but the trials have been placed on hold due to the development of a diseaseD007938 process in two of the children because of insertional oncogenesis.

Gene therapy (GT) with an autologous ncbi947+-enriched cell fraction that contains ncbi947+ cells transduced with a retroviral vector encoding the 9606 ncbi100 cDNA sequence leads to immune reconstitution in most 9606. Here, we report short- and medium-term safety analyses from 18 9606 enrolled as part of single-arm, open-label studies or compassionate use programs. Survival was 100% with a median of 6.9 years follow-up (range, 2.3 to 13.4 years). Adverse events were mostly grade 1 or grade 2 and were reported by all 18 9606 following GT. Thirty-nine serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported by 15 of 18 9606; no SAEs were considered related to GT. The most common adverse events reported post-GT include diseaseD012141, diseaseD005759, diseaseD012220, diseaseD001991, diseaseD002180, diseaseD003371, diseaseD009503, diseaseD003967, and diseaseD005334. Incidence rates for all of these events were highest during pre-treatment, treatment, and/or 3-month follow-up and then declined over medium-term follow-up. GT did not impact the incidence of diseaseD009422. No event indicative of diseaseD002472 was reported.

35643347		chemicalD011108-drug conjugates: Design principles, emerging synthetic strategies and clinical overview.Adagen, an enzyme replacement treatment for diseaseC531816, was the first protein-chemicalD011108 conjugate to be approved in early 1990 s. Post this regulatory approval, numerous polymeric drugs and polymeric nanoparticles have entered the market as advanced or next-generation chemicalD011108-based therapeutics, while many others have currently been tested clinically. The chemicalD011108 conjugation to therapeutic moiety offers several advantages, like enhanced solubilization of drug, controlled release, reduced immunogenicity, and prolonged circulation. The present review intends to highlight considerations in the design of therapeutically effective chemicalD011108-drug conjugates (PDCs), including the choice of linker chemistry. The potential synthetic strategies to formulate PDCs have been discussed along with recent advancements in the different types of PDCs, i.e., chemicalD011108-small molecular weight drug conjugates, chemicalD011108-protein conjugates, and stimuli-responsive PDCs, which are under clinical/preclinical investigation. Current impediments and regulatory hurdles hindering the clinical translation of PDC into effective therapeutic regimens for the amelioration of disease conditions have been addressed.

This diseaseD007153 is associated with severe disturbances in chemicalC030985 metabolism that are thought to mediate lymphotoxicity. The recent generation of diseaseC531816 (diseaseC531816) 10090 has enabled the in vivo examination of mechanisms that may underlie the diseaseD016511 resulting from diseaseC531816. We demonstrate severe depletion of T and B lymphocytes and defects in T and B cell development in diseaseC531816 10090. T cell apoptosis was abundant in thymi of diseaseC531816 10090, but no increase in apoptosis was detected in the spleen and lymph nodes of these animals, suggesting that the defect is specific to developing thymocytes. Studies of mature T cells recovered from spleens of diseaseC531816 10090 revealed that diseaseC531816 is accompanied by ncbi328483 activation defects of T cells in vivo. Furthermore, ex vivo experiments on diseaseC531816 T cells demonstrated that elevated chemicalD000241 is responsible for this abnormal ncbi328483 signaling. These findings suggest that the metabolic disturbances seen in diseaseC531816 10090 affect various signaling pathways that regulate thymocyte survival and function. Experiments with thymocytes ex vivo confirmed that diseaseC531816 reduces tyrosine phosphorylation of ncbi328483-associated signaling molecules and blocks ncbi328483-triggered chemicalD002118 increases.

A rapid quantitative chemicalC030985 assay was developed using UPLC-MS/MS to determine chemicalD011684 and base concentrations in urine. Taking advantages of ultra performance liquid chromatography, we achieved satisfactory analyte separation and recovery with a polar chemicalD014284 column in a short run time with no requirement of time-consuming sample preparation or derivatization. This targeted assay is intended for diagnosis and management of diseaseC562587 diseases, newborn screening follow-up of diseaseD053632, and evaluation of diseaseD000067877.

Enzyme diseaseC531816 represents from 10% to 15% of the diseaseD053632. This generates diminished maturation of the cell precursors. Treatments include enzyme replacement therapy, allogenic, or autologous HSCT with gene therapy, with HSCT being of choice when an identical ncbi3105 donor exists. CASE REPORT: Male 9606, without relevant family antecedents or consanguinity. The 9606 had multiple diseaseD007239 during the first months of life, evidencing low immunoglobulin levels, with absence of T and B lymphocytes, and natural killer cells. Severe diseaseD053632 are considered due to diseaseC531816; management was begun and is derived to our hospital. Admission at 8 months of life, with chronic diseaseD044342 and diseaseD011596. The ncbi3105 studies were conducted without finding an identical donor, taken to HSCT with haploidentical donor. Conditioning regimen with chemicalD003520, chemicalC024352, chemicalD008558, and thymoglobulin. This 9606 received prophylaxis for diseaseD006086 with chemicalD003520, chemicalD016572, and chemicalD008727. A 22 months post-transplant, the 9606 was without immunosuppressants or immunoglobulin, without evidence of diseaseD006086 or new diseaseD007239. CONCLUSIONS: The diseaseC531816 is an infrequent pathology that can be potentially fatal if adequate treatment is not started. Haploidentical HSCT, using post-transplantation chemicalD003520, emerges as a viable option with which good results can be achieved and improve the quality of life in 9606 with no other therapeutic alternatives.

A three-yr-old Japanese boy was diagnosed with delayed-onset diseaseC531816 because of recurrent diseaseD001991, bronchiectasia, and diseaseD008231. In addition, diseaseD013967 and diseaseD009503 were present. At four yr of age, he underwent BMT with a RIC regimen, including chemicalD002066 and chemicalC024352, from an HLA-identical healthy sister. Engraftment after BMT was uneventful without GVHD. Decreased ncbi100 levels in blood immediately increased following BMT, and the 9606 was disease-free 13 months after BMT. These results suggest that BMT with RIC may sufficiently restore immune regulation in delayed-onset diseaseC531816. A longer follow-up period is needed to confirm these observations.

A full blood count revealed profound diseaseD008231. The child was diagnosed with diseaseC531816, a rare cause of diseaseD016511 (diseaseD016511). diseaseD016511 is an immunological emergency and must be considered in any lymphopaenic infant with diseaseD009894. We discuss diseaseC531816 diseaseD016511, which can involve multiple systems and in which other treatment options apart from bone marrow transplant are available.
21375467		Genotoxicity of retroviral hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy.INTRODUCTION: Retroviral vectors have been developed for hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene therapy and have successfully cured diseaseD053632 (diseaseD053632), diseaseC531816 (diseaseC531816), diseaseD000326, and diseaseD014923. However, in HSC gene therapy clinical trials, genotoxicity mediated by integrated vector proviruses has led to clonal expansion, and in some cases frank diseaseD007938. Numerous studies have been performed to understand the molecular basis of vector-mediated genotoxicity with the aim of developing safer vectors and safer gene therapy protocols. These genotoxicity studies are critical to advancing HSC gene therapy. AREAS COVERED: This review provides an introduction to the mechanisms of retroviral vector genotoxicity. It also covers advances over the last 20 years in designing safer gene therapy vectors, and in integration site analysis in clinical trials and large animal models. Mechanisms of retroviral-mediated genotoxicity, and the risk factors that contribute to clonal expansion and diseaseD007938 in HSC gene therapy are introduced. EXPERT OPINION: Continued research on virus-host interactions and next-generation vectors should further improve the safety of future HSC gene therapy vectors and protocols.
22348551		Gene therapy for diseaseD016511 due to diseaseC531816.The diseaseD016511 caused by the diseaseC531816 (diseaseC531816) was the first diseaseD009358 for which gene therapy was developed. Over 30 9606 have been treated worldwide using the current protocols, and most of them have experienced clinical benefit; importantly, in the absence of any vector-related complications. In this document, we review the progress made so far in the development and establishment of gene therapy as an alternative form of treatment for diseaseC531816 9606.
21271505		diseaseD006932 and rapid fatal diseaseD017093 in diseaseD016511 caused by diseaseC531816 (diseaseC531816).diseaseC531816 is the cause for diseaseD016511 (diseaseD016511) in about 15% of 9606 with diseaseD016511, often presenting as diseaseD001260 (diseaseD006509 (-)NK (-)diseaseD016511. Treatment options for diseaseC531816 are enzyme replacement, bone marrow transplantation or gene therapy. We here describe the first 9606 with diseaseC531816 and fatal diseaseD017093 despite bone marrow transplantation from a 10/10 HLA identical related donor. As 9606 with diseaseC531816 may be at yet underestimated increased risk for rapid diseaseD017093 we speculate whether diseaseD056486 in diseaseC531816 should lead to the immediate treatment with enzyme replacement by pegylated ADA.
27056559		Gene Therapy for the Treatment of diseaseD000081207.The use of gene therapy in the treatment of diseaseD000081207 (diseaseD000081207) has advanced significantly in the last decade. Clinical trials for diseaseD053632, diseaseC531816 (diseaseC531816), diseaseD006105, and diseaseD014923 have demonstrated that gene transfer into hematopoietic stem cells and autologous transplant can result in clinical improvement and is curative for many 9606. Unfortunately, early clinical trials were complicated by vector-related insertional mutagenic events for several diseases with the exception of diseaseC531816 diseaseD053632. These results prompted the current wave of clinical trials for diseaseD000081207 using alternative retro- or lenti-viral vector constructs that are self-inactivating, and they have shown clinical efficacy without diseaseD007938 events thus far. The field of gene therapy continues to progress, with improvements in viral vector profiles, stem cell culturing techniques, and site-specific genome editing platforms. The future of gene therapy is promising, and we are quickly moving towards a time when it will be a standard cellular therapy for many forms of diseaseD000081207. 
35914665		Newborn tandem mass spectroscopy screening for diseaseC531816.BACKGROUND: Newborn screening (NBS) by means of T cell receptor excision circles (TREC) is now universal in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Navajo Nation as a strategy to identify diseaseD016511 (diseaseD016511) in newborns. Owing to the characteristics of diseaseC531816, a small but important number of cases can be missed by this screening. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the results of the first year statewide NBS for ADA by means of dried blood spot NBS. METHODS: On October 7, 2019, the state of Michigan began screening newborn dried blood spots for diseaseC531816 by means of the Neobase-2 tandem mass spectroscopy (TMS) kit. We report 1 known case of diseaseC531816 in the 18 months before screening. We then reviewed the results of the first 2 years of TMS ADA screening in Michigan. RESULTS: There was 1 9606 with diseaseC531816 known to our centers in the 18 months before initiation of TMS ADA screening; this 9606 died of complications of their disease. In the first 2 years of TMS ADA NBS, 206,321 infants were screened, and 2 9606 had positive ADA screen results. Both 9606 had diseaseC531816 confirmed through biochemical and genetic testing. One 9606 identified also had a positive TREC screen and was confirmed to have diseaseC531816. CONCLUSION: In our first 2 years, TMS NBS for diseaseC531816 identified 2 9606 with diseaseC531816 at negligible cost, including 1 9606 who would not have been identified by TREC NBS. This report provides initial evidence of the value of specific NBS for diseaseC531816.

In its early-onset form, it is rapidly fatal to infants. Delayed or late-onset diseaseC531816 is characterized by insidious progressive diseaseD007153 that leads to permanent diseaseD000092124 or diseaseD003643. Quantification of T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) or tandem mass spectrometry (tandem-MS) analysis of dried blood spots (DBSs) collected at birth can identify newborns with early-onset diseaseC531816 and are used in screening programs. However, it is not clear whether these analyses can identify newborns who will have delayed or late-onset diseaseC531816 before symptoms appear. OBJECTIVE: We performed a retrospective study to evaluate whether tandem-MS and quantitative TREC analyses of DBSs could identify newborns who had delayed-onset diseaseC531816 later in life. METHODS: We tested stored DBSs collected at birth from 3 9606 with delayed-onset diseaseC531816 using tandem-MS (PCT EP2010/070517) to evaluate levels of chemicalD000241 and chemicalC058118 and real-time PCR to quantify TREC levels. We also analyzed DBSs from 3 newborns with early-onset diseaseC531816 and 2 healthy newborn carriers of diseaseC531816. RESULTS: The DBSs taken at birth from the 3 9606 with delayed-onset diseaseC531816 had chemicalD000241 levels of 10, 25, and 19 mumol/L (normal value, <1.5 mumol/L) and chemicalC058118 levels of 0.7, 2.7, and 2.4 mumol/L (normal value, <0.07 mumol/L); the mean levels of chemicalD000241 and chemicalC058118 were respectively 12.0- and 27.6-fold higher than normal values. DBSs taken at birth from all 3 9606 with delayed-onset diseaseC531816 had normal TREC levels, but TRECs were undetectable in blood samples taken from the same 9606 at the time of diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Tandem-MS but not TREC quantification identifies newborns with delayed- or late-onset diseaseC531816.
25875699		Outcomes in two Japanese diseaseC531816 9606 treated by stem cell gene therapy with no cytoreductive conditioning.OBJECTIVE: We here describe treatment outcomes in two diseaseC531816 9606 (9606) who received stem cell gene therapy (SCGT) with no cytoreductive conditioning. As this protocol has features distinct from those of other clinical trials, its results provide insights into SCGT for diseaseC531816. 9606 AND METHODS: Pt 1 was treated at age 4.7 years, whereas diseaseD020803, who had previously received T-cell gene therapy, was treated at age 13 years. Bone marrow ncbi947(+) cells were harvested after enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) was withdrawn; following transduction of ADA cDNA by the gamma-retroviral vector GCsapM-ADA, they were administered intravenously. No cytoreductive conditioning, at present considered critical for therapeutic benefit, was given before cell infusion. Hematological/immunological reconstitution kinetics, levels of systemic detoxification, gene-marking levels, and proviral insertion sites in hematopoietic cells were assessed. RESULTS: Treatment was well tolerated, and no serious adverse events were observed. Engraftment of gene-modified repopulating cells was evidenced by the appearance and maintenance of peripheral lymphocytes expressing functional ADA. Systemic detoxification was moderately achieved, allowing temporary discontinuation of ERT for 6 and 10 years in 9606 1 and diseaseD020803, respectively. Recovery of immunity remained partial, with lymphocyte counts in pts 1 and 2, peaked at 408/mm(3) and 1248/mm(3), approximately 2 and 5 years after SCGT. Vector integration site analyses confirmed that hematopoiesis was reconstituted with a limited number of clones, some of which were shown to have myelo-lymphoid potential. CONCLUSIONS: Outcomes in SCGT for diseaseC531816 are described in the context of a unique protocol, which used neither ERT nor cytoreductive conditioning. Although proven safe, immune reconstitution was partial and temporary. Our results reiterate the importance of cytoreductive conditioning to ensure greater benefits from SCGT.
31812707	Association|diseaseD007153|ncbi100	disease614963 in an diseaseC531816 9606 during 27 years of enzyme replacement therapy.INTRODUCTION: ncbi100ncbi100 causes severe diseaseD007153 that is lethal in infancy. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) can improve the metabolic, immune and non-diseaseD007154 in 9606 prior to transplantation, however, its benefits over extended periods are not well characterized. We describe a 28-year-old female who received ERT for 27 years. She suffered from EBV negative diseaseD016393 at 14 years of age and diseaseD020275 2 years later. At 22 years of age, she experienced a diseaseD005767 with 36812. At 26 years of age, diseaseD008223 reoccurred with multiple diseaseD008107 followed by diseaseD009164 with dissemination to the brain. Throughout this period, ncbi100 activity in the plasma was within the therapeutic range. Repeated evaluations demonstrated very low lymphocyte counts and impaired T cell function. CONCLUSIONS: ERT might be insufficient to maintain normal immunity over extended periods in some diseaseC531816 9606.
19776764		Progress and prospects: gene therapy for diseaseD000081207.Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is now widely used to treat diseaseD000081207 (diseaseD000081207). For 9606 with specific disorders (diseaseD016511, diseaseC531816 (diseaseC531816)-diseaseD016511, diseaseD006105 (diseaseD006105) and diseaseD014923 (diseaseD014923)) who lack a suitable 9606 leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched donor, gene therapy has offered an important alternative treatment option. The success of gene therapy can be attributed, in part, to the selective advantage offered to gene-corrected cells, the avoidance of diseaseD006086 and to the use of pre-conditioning in 9606 with chemotherapy to facilitate engraftment of corrected cells. Adverse events have been encountered and this has led to detailed characterization of retroviral vector integration profiles. A new generation of self-inactivating retroviral and lentiviral vectors have been designed to address these safety concerns, and are at an advanced stage of preparation for the next phase of clinical testing.
22447032		Delayed onset diseaseC531816 associated with diseaseD004673.diseaseD004673 (diseaseD004673) is a monophasic, diseaseD003711 that can appear after either immunizations or, more often, diseaseD007239. Magnetic resonance imaging of 9606 shows diseaseD007249 the brain and spinal cord. An immune-mediated mechanism may play a role in this disease, although its precise pathogenesis remains unclear. In this study, a 2-year-old boy presented with diseaseD004673, and he showed improvement on treatment with high-dose intravenous corticosteroids. At the age of 3 years, the presence of recurrent diseaseD001991, bronchiectasia, and diseaseD008231 suggested that the 9606 was suffering from diseaseD053632. The 9606 was finally diagnosed with delayed onset diseaseC531816. Delayed onset diseaseC531816 is frequently associated with diseaseD001327, including diseaseD013966 and diseaseD006402, both of which were observed in the 9606. The diseaseD004673 in this 9606 may be a presentation of delayed onset diseaseC531816.

Without enzyme replacement or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, 9606 often suffer fatal diseaseD007239 in infancy. ncbi100 is expressed ubiquitously; deficiency may affect various organs, including the brain. diseaseD009461 occur in some diseaseC531816 9606, mostly in association with diseaseD007239 or after bone marrow transplantation. Three cases with significant diseaseD009461, including diseaseD009123, diseaseD006258, diseaseD009759, diseaseD015835, diseaseD004827, and moderate-severe diseaseD002658 but with no evidence of diseaseD007239 or transplant-related medication diseaseD064420 are presented. Computed tomographic scans and cranial MRI revealed diseaseD016388 and diseaseD001480, which may reflect accelerated nerve cell death or altered stimulation of adenosine receptors. Detailed neurologic and neuroimaging evaluation should be performed for all 9606 with diseaseC531816 upon diagnosis, to identify potentially significant diseaseD001927.
20493400		Gene therapy for diseaseC531816.In the last decade, gene therapy for diseaseC531816 has been developed as a successful alternative strategy to allogeneic bone marrow transplant and enzyme replacement therapy. Infusion of autologous hematopoietic stem cells, corrected ex vivo by retroviral vectors and combined to low-intensity conditioning regimen, has resulted in immunologic improvement, metabolic correction, and long-term clinical benefits. These findings have opened the way to applications of gene therapy in other primary diseaseD007154 using novel vector technology.
17185467		9606 with diseaseC531816 surviving after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation are at high risk of diseaseD002493.diseaseC531816 is a systemic diseaseD008659 that causes an autosomal recessive variant of diseaseD016511 (diseaseD016511) and less consistently other complications including diseaseD009461. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is able to correct the diseaseD007153, whereas control of nonimmunologic complications has not been extensively explored. We applied HSCT in 15 diseaseC531816 9606 consecutively treated at our institutions since 1982 and analyzed long-term outcome. Seven 9606 received transplants without conditioning from HLA-matched family donors (MFDs); the other 8 9606 received conditioning and were given transplants either from HLA-mismatched family donors (MMFDs; n = 6) or from matched unrelated donors (MUDs; n = 2). At a mean follow-up period of 12 years (range, 4-22 years), 12 9606 are alive with stable and complete immune reconstitution (7 of 7 after MFD, 4 of 6 after MMFD, and 1 of 2 after MUD transplantation). Six of 12 surviving 9606 show marked diseaseD009461, which include diseaseD008607, diseaseD000068079, and diseaseD006319. We were unable to identify disease or transplantation-related factors correlating with this divergent neurologic outcome. The high rate of diseaseD009461 observed in long-term surviving 9606 with diseaseC531816 indicates that HSCT commonly fails to control diseaseD002493 in this diseaseD008659.
19638621	Association|diseaseC531816|ncbi280712	How I treat diseaseC531816.diseaseC531816 is a disorder of diseaseC562587 metabolism leading to diseaseD016511 (diseaseC531816). Without treatment, the condition is fatal and requires early intervention. Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the major treatment for diseaseC531816, although survival following different donor sources varies considerably. Unlike other diseaseD053632 forms, 2 other options are available for diseaseC531816: enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with pegylated 9913 ncbi280712, and autologous haematopoietic stem cell gene therapy (GT). Due to the rarity of the condition, the lack of large scale outcome studies, and availability of different treatments, guidance on treatment strategies is limited. We have reviewed the currently available evidence and together with our experience of managing this condition propose a consensus management strategy. Matched sibling donor transplants represent a successful treatment option with high survival rates and excellent immune recovery. Mismatched parental donor transplants have a poor survival outcome and should be avoided unless other treatments are unavailable. ERT and GT both show excellent survival, and therefore the choice between ERT, MUD transplant, or GT is difficult and dependent on several factors, including accessibility to the different modalities, response of 9606 to long-term ERT, and the attitudes of physicians and parents to the short- and potential long-term risks associated with different treatments.
20534204		[Gene therapy for diseaseD016511].New results with gene therapy for diseaseD016511 due to diseaseC531816 are promising. We review a clinical project in which ten children were treated with gene modified autologous haematopoietic stem cells. After treatment, eight 9606 were able to do without enzyme-replacement therapy, and nine 9606 showed improved immune function and sustained low concentration of toxic metabolites. No clonal outgrow was observed indicating a limited risk for future malignant development. Despite these promising results, the safety of gene therapy can still be improved.
24578017	Association|diseaseD053632|ncbi3575; Association|diseaseD053632|ncbi3561	Newborn screening for diseaseD053632 in New York State: experience from the first two years.PURPOSE: To describe the process and assess outcomes for the first 2 years of newborn screening for diseaseD016511 (diseaseD053632 NBS) in New York State (NYS). METHODS: The NYS algorithm utilizes a first-tier molecular screen for TRECs (T-cell receptor excision circles), the absence of which is indicative of increased risk of diseaseD007153. RESULTS: During the first 2 years, 485,912 infants were screened for diseaseD053632. Repeat specimens were requested from 561 premature and 746 non-premature infants with low or borderline TRECs. A total of 531 infants were referred for diagnostic evaluation leading to identification of 10 infants with diseaseD053632 and 87 with a clinically significant non-diseaseD053632 abnormality based on flow cytometry or CBC results (positive predictive value 20.3 %). Nine infants were diagnosed with typical diseaseD053632 and one with leaky diseaseD053632. diseaseD053632 diagnoses included two 9606 with diseaseC531816, three 9606 with typical and one with leaky ncbi3561-related diseaseD053632, one 9606 with ncbi3575-related diseaseD053632, and three cases of typical diseaseD053632, etiology unknown. TRECs were undetectable in eight of the nine babies with typical diseaseD053632. Infants with other non-diseaseD053632 conditions included 27 9606 with a syndrome that included diseaseC536780, 18 of which had diseaseD004062. Seventeen infants had diseaseC536780 secondary to another clinically significant condition, and 13 were classified as 'other'. Among 30 infants classified as diseaseD008231, 11 have since resolved, and the remainder continues to be followed. One infant with undetectable TRECs had normal follow-up studies. Molecular studies revealed the presence of two changes in the infant's DNA. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, ten infants with diseaseD053632 were identified during the first 2 years of screening in NYS, yielding an incidence of approximately 1 in 48,500 live births, which is consistent with the incidence observed by other states screening for diseaseD053632. The incidence of any clinically significant laboratory abnormality was approximately 1 in 5,000; both estimates are higher than estimates prior to the onset of newborn screening for diseaseD053632. Improvements to the NYS algorithm included the addition of a borderline category that reduced the proportion of infants referred for flow cytometric analysis, without decreasing sensitivity. We identified a large number of infants with abnormal TRECs and subsequent diseaseD008231. Long-term follow-up studies are needed to determine the prognosis and optimal treatment for this group of 9606, some of whom may present with previously unrecognized, transient diseaseD008231 of infancy.
9801258	Association|chemicalD011092|diseaseC531816	diseaseC531816: clinical expression, molecular basis, and therapy.diseaseC531816diseaseC531816 is the first known cause of diseaseD016511 (diseaseD016511). Over the past 25 years, the metabolic basis for diseaseD007154 has largely been established. The clinical spectrum associated with diseaseC531816 is now quite broad, including older children and adults. The ADA gene has been sequenced, the structure of the enzyme has been determined, and over 50 ADA gene mutations have been identified. There appears to be a quantitative relationship between residual ADA activity, determined by genotype, and both metabolic and clinical phenotype. diseaseC531816 has become a focus for novel approaches to enzyme replacement and gene therapy. Enzyme replacement with chemicalD011092 (chemicalD011092)-modified ADA, used to treat 9606 who lack a 9606 leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched bone marrow donor, is safe and effective, but expensive. Several approaches to gene therapy have been investigated in 9606 receiving PEG-ADA. Persistent expression of transduced ADA cDNA in T lymphocytes and myeloid cells has occurred in a few 9606, but significant improvement in immune function because of the transduced cells has not been shown. The major barrier to effective gene therapy remains the low efficiency of stem cell transduction with retroviral vectors.

Previous clinical trials showed that autologous ncbi947+ cell gene therapy (GT) following chemicalD002066 reduced-intensity conditioning is a promising therapeutic approach for diseaseC531816, but long-term data are warranted. Here we report an analysis on long-term safety and efficacy data of 43 9606 with diseaseC531816 who received retroviral ex vivo bone marrow-derived hematopoietic stem cell GT. Twenty-two individuals (median follow-up 15.4 years) were treated in the context of clinical development or named 9606 program. Nineteen 9606 were treated post-marketing authorization (median follow-up 3.2 years), and two additional 9606 received mobilized peripheral blood ncbi947+ cell GT. At data cutoff, all 43 9606 were alive, with a median follow-up of 5.0 years (interquartile range 2.4-15.4) and 2 years intervention-free survival (no need for long-term enzyme replacement therapy or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation) of 88% (95% confidence interval 78.7-98.4%). Most adverse events/reactions were related to disease background, chemicalD002066 conditioning or immune reconstitution; the safety profile of the real world experience was in line with premarketing cohort. One 9606 from the named 9606 program developed a diseaseD015458 related to treatment 4.7 years after GT and is currently in remission. Long-term persistence of multilineage gene-corrected cells, metabolic detoxification, immune reconstitution and decreased diseaseD007239 rates were observed. Estimated mixed-effects models showed that higher dose of ncbi947+ cells infused and younger age at GT affected positively the plateau of CD3+ transduced cells, lymphocytes and ncbi920+ ncbi5788+ naive T cells, whereas the cell dose positively influenced the final plateau of ncbi2526+ transduced cells. These long-term data suggest that the risk-benefit of GT in ADA remains favorable and warrant for continuing long-term safety monitoring. Clinical trial registration: NCT00598481 , NCT03478670 .

11434885		[Substitution therapy with hematopoietic progenitors in the diseaseD000081207].Hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation is currently the most appropriate substitution therapy in the most severe forms of diseaseD000081207 (all the variants of diseaseD053632, WA, CID etc.). It can achieve total and permanent immunological reconstitution in 60% of 9606, depending on histocompatibility, source of the hematopoietic stem cells and the underlying disease. Stem-cell sources may be bone marrow, umbilical cord blood and the peripheral blood of donors previously treated with colony stimulating factors for the mobilization ncbi947. We discuss the differences in the results obtained in 9606 treated at the Hospital Materno-Infantil Vall d'Hebron. Gene therapy opens a new era in the treatment of diseaseD000081207. The first 9606 to undergo this treatment in the United States of America had diseaseC531816, even though sustained remodeling has not been achieved. The favorable results obtained in 9606 with diseaseD053632 by deficit in the gamma chain of the IL-2 receptor in Paris, with more than a year of follow up, suggest that the near future is promising. We also discuss the differences observed according to the vectors used and the underlying disease.

10942363	Association|chemicalC026600|diseaseC531816; Negative_Correlation|chemicalC024352|diseaseD009102	Nonmyeloablative stem cell transplantation for diseaseD000081207.The optimal approach for stem cell transplantation in children with diseaseD007153 has yet to be determined. Conditioning therapy is necessary for reliable engraftment and full immune reconstitution; however, the beneficial effect of cytoreductive conditioning is counterbalanced by increased short- and long-term treatment-related diseaseD064420. Whether bone marrow transplantation with a nonmyeloablative preparative regimen was sufficient for the establishment of donor immune reconstitution, with the resultant correction of disease phenotype, was investigated. Eight 9606 with severe diseaseD007153 states underwent T-cell replete bone marrow transplantation from a 9606 leukocyte antigen-matched unrelated (n = 6) or sibling (n = 2) donor with nonmyeloablative conditioning using a chemicalC024352-chemicalD008558-anti-lymphocyte globulin-based regimen. All 9606 had severe diseaseD009102 that precluded transplantation with conventional conditioning. All 9606 were engrafted with predominantly donor hematopoiesis, and the duration of diseaseD009503 was brief. Significant diseaseD006086 (diseaseD006086) did not develop, but one 9606 had limited chronic diseaseD006086. One 9606 died of disease recurrence, and 3 have stable, mixed chimerism. At a median follow-up of 1 year, all 9606 have had good recovery of CD3(+) T-cell numbers, and 6 of 7 evaluable 9606 have normal phytohemagglutinin stimulation indices. The rate of immune reconstitution is comparable with that of historical controls undergoing standard myeloablative protocols. Two 9606 with diseaseC536083 now show significant expression, and a 9606 with diseaseC531816 has improved chemicalC026600 metabolites. In summary, it has been demonstrated that nonmyeloablative stem cell transplantation permits rapid engraftment from both sibling and unrelated donors with minimal diseaseD064420 even in the presence of severe diseaseD009102. If long-term immune reconstitution of 9606 treated with this protocol is demonstrated, it is believed this approach might offer significant advantages compared with standard protocols by combining adequate immune reconstitution with reduced short- and long-term diseaseD064420.

26730942	Association|diseaseD029424|ncbi17863	Alveolar-like Stem Cell-derived ncbi17863(-) Macrophages Promote Recovery and Survival in diseaseD029424.RATIONALE: Abnormal alveolar macrophages (AM) are found in diseaseD029424, diseaseD001249, diseaseD003550, and diseaseC531816 (diseaseC531816). There is no specific treatment strategy to compensate for these innate diseaseD007154. Recent findings suggest AMs are of early embryonic or fetal origin. Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) as a source of embryonic-derived AMs for therapeutic use in acute and chronic diseaseD029424 has yet to be investigated. OBJECTIVES: To determine if embryonic ncbi17863(-/-) alveolar-like macrophages have therapeutic value on pulmonary transplantation in acute and chronic diseaseD029424. METHODS: Directed differentiation of 10090 PSCs was used in factor-defined media to produce expandable embryonic macrophages conditioned to an alveolar-like phenotype with ncbi12981. AMs were partially depleted in 10090 to create an diseaseD055371. To model a chronic diseaseD008171, diseaseC531816 10090 were used. Alveolar-like macrophages were intratracheally transplanted to the injured animals and therapeutic potential was determined. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The differentiation protocol is highly efficient and adaptable to 9606 PSCs. The PSC macrophages are phenotypically like AMs both functionally and by ligand marker characterization. They engulf 629395 and apoptotic cells and are better phagocytes than bone marrow-derived macrophages. In vivo, these macrophages remain in healthy airways for at least 4 weeks, can engulf neutrophils during diseaseD055371, enhance pulmonary tissue repair, and promote survival in diseaseC531816 10090. Animals receiving the macrophages do not develop abnormal pathology or diseaseD013724. CONCLUSIONS: PSCs are a reliable source to produce therapeutically active alveolar-like macrophages to treat diseaseD029424.
31261096		diseaseD016511: A Review for Neonatal Clinicians.The proper development and function of T cells is imperative in the creation of adequate cell-mediated and humoral immunity. Healthy term newborns have baseline immune immaturity, increasing their risk of diseaseD007239, but significant immunologic consequences can occur, because of abnormal T-cell maturation. diseaseD053632 can result, because B cells and natural killer cells rely on successful interactions with T cells to ensure their proper performance and survival. diseaseD016511 (diseaseD016511) is the most noteworthy of these conditions, leading to considerable early morbidity and often diseaseD003643 by the age of 1 year if left untreated. Newborn screening for diseaseD016511 is effective and allows for early implementation of lifesaving supportive measures, including protective isolation, initiation of prophylactic antimicrobials, caution with blood product transfusions, and avoidance of live vaccinations. Once a definitive diagnosis of diseaseD016511 has been established, treatment frequently involves bone marrow or stem cell transplantation; however, enzyme replacement and gene therapy are also becoming options in those with diseaseD016511 due to diseaseC531816 and other forms of diseaseD016511. Neonatal clinicians should understand the screening and diagnostic approach to diseaseD016511 along with the initial management approaches for these extremely high-risk 9606.
24471251		9606 gene therapy: a brief overview of the genetic revolution.Advances in biotechnology have brought gene therapy to the forefront of medical research. The prelude to successful gene therapy i.e. the efficient transfer and expression of a variety of 9606 gene into target cells has already been accomplished in several systems. Safe methods have been devised to do this, using several viral and no-viral vectors. Two main approaches emerged: in vivo modification and ex vivo modification. Retrovirus, 10508, 272636 are suitable for gene therapeutic approaches which are based on permanent expression of the therapeutic gene. Non-viral vectors are far less efficient than viral vectors, but they have advantages due to their low immunogenicity and their large capacity for therapeutic DNA. To improve the function of non-viral vectors, the addition of viral functions such as receptor mediated uptake and nuclear translocation of DNA may finally lead to the development of an artificial virus. Gene transfer protocols have been approved for 9606 use in diseaseD030342, diseaseD009369 and diseaseD007806. In 1990, the first successful clinical trial of gene therapy was initiated for diseaseC531816. Since then, the number of clinical protocols initiated worldwide has increased exponentially. Although preliminary results of these trials are somewhat disappointing, but 9606 gene therapy dreams of treating diseases by replacing or supplementing the product of defective or introducing novel therapeutic genes. So definitely 9606 gene therapy is an effective addition to the arsenal of approaches to many 9606 therapies in the 21st century.

23179487		Characteristic scapular and rib changes on chest radiographs of children with diseaseC531816 in the first year of life.BACKGROUND: We describe radiographic changes in the ribs and scapulae seen in the first 6 months of life in children with diseaseC531816 diseaseD016511 (diseaseD016511). We suggest that these changes are reversible with appropriate enzyme replacement therapy. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to describe characteristic rib and scapular radiographic changes in infants with diseaseC531816. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective review of chest radiographs of nine children with diseaseC531816 performed in the first year of life by two experienced pediatric radiologists. A control cohort of unaffected children was used for comparison. RESULTS: All children with diseaseC531816 manifested unusual scapular spurring and anterior rib cupping. None of the control children manifested these changes. CONCLUSION: Characteristic and reversible scapular and rib changes in the correct clinical setting should suggest an early diagnosis of diseaseC531816, prompting appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic measures.

After eleven infusions of autologous PBLs transduced with retroviral vector LASN encoding ADAcDNA, he exhibited increased levels of the CD8+ T lymphocytes, serum immunoglobulin, specific antibodies and diseaseD006968 skin tests. Follow-up studies also provided evidence of long-term persistence and function of transduced PBLs with improvement in the immune function. However, the therapeutic effect of this gene therapy has been difficult to assess because of the concomitant treatment of PEG-ncbi100. Two ncbi100-diseaseD053632 9606 have been currently treated with autologous bone marrow ncbi947+ cells engineered with a retroviral vector GCsapM-ncbi100 after discontinuation of PEG-ncbi100. The restoration of intracellular ncbi100 enzymatic activity in lymphocytes and granulocytes resulted in correction of the systemic diseaseD064420 and diseaseD017093 function in the absence of PEG-ncbi100 treatment. Both 9606 are at home where they are clinically well, and they do not experience adversed effect, with follow up being 12 months after ncbi947+ cells gene therapy.
23583799		Gene therapy of diseaseC536780.Gene therapy of severe diseaseD053632 has been proven to be effective to provide sustained correction of the diseaseC536780. This has been achieved for 2 forms of diseaseD053632, i.e diseaseD053632 (diseaseD007153) and diseaseC531816. Occurrence of gene diseaseD064420 generated by integration of first generation retroviral vectors, as observed in the diseaseD053632 trials has led to replace these vectors by self inactivated (SIN) retro(or lenti) viruses that may provide equivalent efficacy with a better safety profile. Results of ongoing clinical studies in diseaseD053632 as well as in other diseaseD000081207, such as the diseaseD014923, will be thus very informative.
22198747		Stem cell gene therapy: the risks of insertional mutagenesis and approaches to minimize genotoxicity.Virus-based vectors are widely used in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene therapy, and have the ability to integrate permanently into genomic DNA, thus driving long-term expression of corrective genes in all hematopoietic lineages. To date, HSC gene therapy has been successfully employed in the clinic for improving clinical outcomes in small numbers of 9606 with diseaseD053632 (diseaseD053632), diseaseC531816 (diseaseC531816), diseaseD000326 (diseaseD000326), diseaseD013789, diseaseD006105 (diseaseD006105), and diseaseD014923 (diseaseD014923). However, adverse events were observed during some of these HSC gene therapy clinical trials, linked to insertional activation of proto-oncogenes by integrated proviral vectors leading to clonal expansion and eventual development of diseaseD007938. Numerous studies have been performed to understand the molecular basis of vector-mediated genotoxicity, with the aim of developing safer vectors and lower-risk gene therapy protocols. This review will summarize current information on the mechanisms of insertional mutagenesis in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells due to integrating gene transfer vectors, discuss the available assays for predicting genotoxicity and mapping vector integration sites, and introduce newly-developed approaches for minimizing genotoxicity as a way to further move HSC gene therapy forward into broader clinical application.

We investigated B diseaseD002292 in ncbi11486-deficient 10090 and found that B cell development in the bone marrow was normal. However, spleens were markedly smaller, their architecture was dramatically altered, and splenic B lymphocytes showed defects in proliferation and activation. ncbi11486-deficient B cells exhibited a higher propensity to undergo B cell receptor-mediated apoptosis than their wild-type counterparts, suggesting that ncbi11486 plays a role in the survival of cells during Ag-dependent responses. In keeping with this finding, ncbi16019 production by extrafollicular plasmablast cells was higher in ncbi11486-deficient than in wild-type 10090, thus indicating that activated B cells accumulate extrafollicularly as a result of a poor or nonexistent germinal center formation. This hypothesis was subsequently confirmed by the profound loss of germinal center architecture. A comparison of levels of the ncbi11486 substrates, chemicalD000241 and chemicalC058118, as well resulting chemicalC026600 levels and ncbi269378 inhibition in bone marrow and spleen suggested that chemicalC026600 accumulation in ncbi11486-deficient spleens may be responsible for impaired B cell development. The altered splenic environment and signaling abnormalities may concurrently contribute to a block in B cell Ag-dependent maturation in ncbi11486-deficient 10090 spleens.

We describe a 34-week female twin who had developed feeding intolerance, perioral diseaseD003490, diseaseD000007 and diseaseD009503 at 1 month of age. Despite several evaluations including an 'inconclusive' newborn screening result for diseaseD016511, the presence of profound diseaseD008231 was unappreciated. Eventually a diagnosis of diseaseD016511 in association with diseaseC531816 was made. This case serves to emphasize the importance of newborn screening for diseaseD016511 in the context of careful evaluation of clinical and laboratory findings that may be overlooked and result in a delay in the diagnosis of a potentially life-threatening condition. 
30194989		Consensus approach for the management of diseaseD016511 caused by diseaseC531816.diseaseD030342 in diseaseC531816 (diseaseC531816) cause a subtype of diseaseD016511 (diseaseD016511) known as diseaseD016511 caused by diseaseC531816 (diseaseC531816). Most affected infants can receive a diagnosis while still asymptomatic by using an diseaseD016511 newborn screening test, allowing early initiation of therapy. We review the evidence currently available and propose a consensus management strategy. In addition to treatment of the diseaseD007154 seen in 9606 with diseaseC531816, 9606 should be followed for specific noninfectious respiratory, neurological, and biochemical complications associated with diseaseC531816. All 9606 should initially receive enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), followed by definitive treatment with either of 2 equal first-line options. If an HLA-matched sibling donor or HLA-matched family donor is available, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) should be pursued. The excellent safety and efficacy observed in more than 100 9606 with diseaseC531816 who received gammaretrovirus- or lentivirus-mediated autologous hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy (HSC-GT) since 2000 now positions HSC-GT as an equal alternative. If HLA-matched sibling donor/HLA-matched family donor HSCT or HSC-GT are not available or have failed, ERT can be continued or reinstituted, and HSCT with alternative donors should be considered. The outcomes of novel HSCT, ERT, and HSC-GT strategies should be evaluated prospectively in "real-life" conditions to further inform these management guidelines.
26876279		Cost-Effectiveness/Cost-Benefit Analysis of Newborn Screening for Severe diseaseD016511 in Washington State.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the expected cost-effectiveness and net benefit of the recent implementation of newborn screening (NBS) for diseaseD016511 (diseaseD016511) in Washington State. STUDY DESIGN: We constructed a decision analysis model to estimate the costs and benefits of NBS in an annual birth cohort of 86 600 infants based on projections of avoided infant diseaseD003643. Point estimates and ranges for input variables, including the birth prevalence of diseaseD016511, proportion detected asymptomatically without screening through family history, screening test characteristics, survival rates, and costs of screening, diagnosis, and treatment were derived from published estimates, expert opinion, and the Washington NBS program. We estimated treatment costs stratified by age of identification and diseaseD016511 type (with or without diseaseC531816). Economic benefit was estimated using values of $4.2 and $9.0 million per diseaseD003643 averted. We performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the influence of key variables on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of net direct cost per life-year saved. RESULTS: Our model predicts an additional 1.19 newborn infants with diseaseD016511 detected preclinically through screening, in addition to those who would have been detected early through family history, and 0.40 diseaseD003643 averted annually. Our base-case model suggests an ICER of $35 311 per life-year saved, and a benefit-cost ratio of either 5.31 or 2.71. Sensitivity analyses found ICER values <$100 000 and positive net benefit for plausible assumptions on all variables. CONCLUSIONS: Our model suggests that NBS for diseaseD016511 in Washington is likely to be cost-effective and to show positive net economic benefit.

23566838		Gene therapy for diseaseD000081207: progress, pitfalls and prospects.Substantial progress has been made in the past decade in treating several diseaseD000081207 (diseaseD000081207) with gene therapy. Current approaches are based on ex-vivo transfer of therapeutic transgene via viral vectors to 9606-derived autologous hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) followed by transplantation back to the 9606 with or without conditioning. The overall outcome from all the clinical trials targeting different diseaseD000081207 has been extremely encouraging but not without caveats. diseaseD009369 outcomes from insertional mutagenesis have featured prominently in the adverse events associated with these trials and have warranted intense pre-clinical investigation into defining the tendencies of different viral vectors for genomic integration. Coupled with issues pertaining to transgene expression, the therapeutic landscape has undergone a paradigm shift in determining safety, stability and efficacy of gene therapy approaches. In this review, we aim to summarize the progress made in the gene therapy trials targeting diseaseC531816, diseaseD053632, diseaseD006105 and WAS, review the pitfalls, and outline the recent advancements which are expected to further enhance favourable risk benefit ratios for gene therapeutic approaches in the future.
15766024		[Treatment of primary diseaseD007154].Management of diseaseD007153 9606 includes monitoring of growth, diet, personal hygiene and life habits, including environmental factors. Major therapeutic stays are prevention, early detection and the decisive treatment of diseaseD007239. Attenuated live vaccines, non-irradiated blood products and blood containing diseaseD003586 antibodies should not be applied. In the case of antibody defects immunoglobulin substitution is a specific form of treatment. Enzyme replacement is a causal approach to an ncbi100 defect. For numerous primary diseaseD007154, bone marrow transplantation represents the best causal therapeutic measure. In the absence of a bone marrow donor, alternative gene therapy is available for the management of diseaseD016511 X-chromosome (diseaseD053632), and diseaseC531816 (diseaseC531816).
22764473		diseaseD016511 due to diseaseC531816.diseaseD016511 is the term applied to a group of rare diseaseD030342 characterised by defective or absent T and B cell functions. 9606 usually present in first 6 months of life with diseaseD012141 and diseaseD005183. Among the various types of diseaseD016511, diseaseD008661 are relatively less common. We report the case of a 6 years old girl having diseaseD016511 due to diseaseC531816.
10082448		Engraftment and chimerism, particularly of T- and B-cells, in children undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.The spectrum of pediatric bone marrow transplantation has changed in recent years. Mismatched and unrelated donor transplants are common, demanding an increased vigilance to detect incipient graft failure, secondary diseaseD008223 as well as relapse and other problems, which now are potentially treatable. To diagnose these complications it may be important to know whether blood and marrow cells are of recipient or donor origin. To evaluate the role of mixed donor-recipient chimerism in relation to clinical problems we adapted a polymerase chain-reaction technique, using fluorescent primers analyzing DNA fragment length polymorphisms, to follow prospectively 17 bone marrow grafted children. To increase the precision of chimerism analysis, immunomagnetically isolated leukocyte populations were assayed in selected cases. Five 9606 encountered clinical problems related to chimerism. One infant with diseaseC531816 failed to engraft stem cells, yet succumbed to diseaseD006086, mediated by mature donor T-cells. Three children developed significant mixed chimerism. One of these three 9606 died in relapse of diseaseD007938, while the two other 9606 who had received T-cell depleted grafts had persistent recipient T-cells, in spite of engraftment. After 5 months, these were displaced by donor T-cells in one of the 9606. In the fifth 9606, also after T-cell depleted BMT, a fatal donor cell diseaseD008223 occurred. Twelve children had stable full chimerism or in one case a low grade mixed chimerism and remain disease-free throughout follow up (median 9 months). In conclusion, the analysis of chimerism, particularly of separated leukocyte populations, offers an almost indispensable insight and a basis for therapeutic decisions in complicated situations such as grafting involving unrelated or mismatched donors, graft manipulation, adoptive immunotherapy and in diseaseD007153 9606.

OBJECTIVES: We sought to characterize the frequency and features of diseaseD011649 (diseaseD011649) in 9606 with diseaseC531816. METHODS: Clinical and laboratory features of all 9606 with diseaseD016511 caused by diseaseC531816 in a single center were analyzed. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and lung biopsy specimens were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and chemicalD010504-Schiff, visualized by means of electron microscopy, and studied for associated diseaseD007239. As a control group, BAL fluid and biopsy specimens from 22 9606 with diseaseD016511 caused by other diseaseD030342 were similarly assessed. RESULTS: Among 16 consecutive 9606 with diseaseC531816, 7 had BAL fluid containing chemicalD010504-Schiff-positive surfactant-like material with macrophages engulfing degenerating lamellar bodies and/or lung biopsy specimens with alveolar spaces filled with homogeneous granular eosinophilic material and large macrophages. The lung pathology was typical of diseaseD011649. Identification of various pathogens coincided with diseaseD011649 in 3 of these 9606. We have diagnosed diseaseD011649 among 9606 with diseaseC531816 more commonly in the last 10 years than previously (P= .05), likely reflecting increased awareness of this condition. There were no significant differences in the clinical or immunologic characteristics between 9606 with diseaseC531816 with or without diseaseD011649. Similar findings of diseaseD011649 were not found among 9606 with diseaseD016511 caused by other diseaseD030342 (P= .001). ncbi100 coupled to chemicalD011092 or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation rapidly corrected this diseaseD008171. diseaseD011649 seems to have contributed to the diseaseD003643 of only 1 9606 with diseaseC531816. CONCLUSIONS: diseaseC531816 predisposes to the development of diseaseD011649, which could be reversed after enzyme replacement or transplantation.
23618815		History of gene therapy.Two decades after the initial gene therapy trials and more than 1700 approved clinical trials worldwide we not only have gained much new information and knowledge regarding gene therapy in general, but also learned to understand the concern that has persisted in society. Despite the setbacks gene therapy has faced, success stories have increasingly emerged. Examples for these are the positive recommendation for a gene therapy product (Glybera) by the EMA for approval in the European Union and the positive trials for the treatment of diseaseC531816, diseaseD053632 and diseaseD000326. Nevertheless, our knowledge continues to grow and during the course of time more safety data has become available that helps us to develop better gene therapy approaches. Also, with the increased understanding of molecular medicine, we have been able to develop more specific and efficient gene transfer vectors which are now producing clinical results. In this review, we will take a historical view and highlight some of the milestones that had an important impact on the development of gene therapy. We will also discuss briefly the safety and ethical aspects of gene therapy and address some concerns that have been connected with gene therapy as an important therapeutic modality. 
22622038	Association|diseaseD053632|ncbi100; Association|diseaseC531816|ncbi10950	Defective B cell tolerance in diseaseC531816 is corrected by gene therapy.ncbi100 (ncbi100) gene defects are among the most common causes of diseaseD053632. Restoration of chemicalC030985 metabolism and immune functions can be achieved by enzyme replacement therapy, or more effectively by bone marrow transplant or HSC gene therapy (HSC-GT). However, diseaseD020274 and autoantibody production, including diseaseC564596 antibodies (ANAs), frequently occur in diseaseC531816 9606 after treatment. To assess whether diseaseC531816 affects the establishment of B cell tolerance, we tested the reactivity of recombinant antibodies isolated from single B cells of diseaseC531816 9606 before and after HSC-GT. We found that before HSC-GT, new emigrant/transitional and mature naive B cells from diseaseC531816 9606 contained more autoreactive and ncbi10950-expressing clones, indicative of defective central and peripheral B cell tolerance checkpoints. We further observed impaired B cell receptor (BCR) and TLR functions in B cells after ncbi100 inhibition, which may underlie the defects in B cell tolerance. Strikingly, after HSC-GT, diseaseC531816 9606 displayed quasi-normal early B cell tolerance checkpoints, as evidenced by restored removal of developing autoreactive and ncbi10950-expressing B cells. Hence, ncbi100 plays an essential role in controlling autoreactive B cell counterselection by regulating BCR and TLR functions.

To better understand the causes of T-cell depletion in vivo and to discriminate between extracellular and intracellular effects of exogenously added chemicalD000241 in vitro, we investigated mechanisms of 2 different effects of chemicalD000241 on 10090 thymocytes. These effects of chemicalD000241 include direct induction of apoptosis in about 6% to 15% thymocytes and inhibition of ncbi328483 (ncbi328483)-induced activation of the majority of thymocytes with inhibited ADA. A(2A) adenosine receptors, but not ncbi109667, are shown to be mostly responsible for extAdo-triggered signaling (chemicalD000242 [chemicalD000242] accumulation) in 10090 thymocytes and this prompted studies of the effects of extAdo on thymocytes from ncbi11540 gene-deficient 10090. It is found that direct apoptotic effects of extAdo on ncbi12504(+)CD8(+) double positive (DP) thymocytes are completely accounted for by signaling through ncbi11540, with no contribution of intracellular lymphotoxicity or of compensating A(2B)Rs because only ncbi11540 +/+, but not ncbi11540 -/- thymocytes were susceptible to apoptotic effects of extAdo. Studies of the effects of chemicalD000242-raising agents support observations of extAdo/ncbi11540/chemicalD000242-triggered apoptosis in DP thymocytes. Unexpectedly, the extAdo strongly inhibited ncbi328483-triggered activation of both ncbi11540 +/+ and ncbi11540 -/- thymocytes in the presence of ADA inhibitors. This was confirmed with thymocytes from ADA gene-deficient 10090, suggesting the existence of ncbi11540-independent effects of extAdo on thymocytes. The presented data raises questions about the identity and functional role of ncbi11540-expressing thymocytes in T-cell differentiation and of the role of ncbi328483-antagonizing effects of extAdo in conditions of ADA diseaseD016511.

27763769		Standing on the Shoulders of Stem Cell Gene Therapists: History, Hyperbole, and Hope for the Future.A new type of medicine approved in Europe at the end of May represents the culmination of the successful convergence of two fields of science: stem cell transplantation and gene therapy. Strimvelis, a 9606-specific gene-modified stem cell medicine for diseaseC531816 (diseaseC531816 leading to severe diseaseD053632; a fatal diseaseD009358 similar to the bubble-boy disease), was developed by scientists at the San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy (TIGET) in Milan, Italy, which then later partnered with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK, Brentford, UK). The journey took more than 25 years of dedicated work by many groups and involved a pivotal trial with 12 children and their brave families. I was fortunate to be involved on the GSK side of the TIGET alliance from 2010 to 2015, building on my previous experiences with gene-modified stem cells during a postdoctoral fellowship in the mid-1990s and at Chiron, which had acquired Viagene, an early gene therapy biotech firm. I thought it was timely to pick out a couple of observations from the development of Strimvelis, to see how these might apply to the future of stem cell gene therapy and perhaps act like shoulders for the related chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (diseaseC535887) and gene-editing technologies to stand on.

In this article we discuss the significance and implications of this historic approval for the broader gene therapy field.
29690908	Association|chemicalC030985|diseaseC531816	diseaseC531816: a review.diseaseC531816diseaseC531816 leads to an accumulation of toxic chemicalC030985 degradation by-products, most potently affecting lymphocytes, leading to diseaseC531816 diseaseD016511. Whilst most notable affects are on lymphocytes, other manifestations include diseaseD009139, diseaseD019964 and diseaseD012877 associated with diseaseD011649. Affected 9606 present in early infancy, usually with persistent diseaseD007239, or with diseaseD011665. Three treatment options are currently available. Initial treatment with enzyme replacement therapy may alleviate acute symptoms and enable partial immunological reconstitution, but treatment is life-long, immune reconstitution is incomplete, and the reconstituted immune system may nullify the effects of the enzyme replacement. Hematopoietic stem cell transplant has long been established as the treatment of choice, particularly where a matched sibling or well matched unrelated donor is available. More recently, the use of gene addition techniques to correct the diseaseD030342 in autologous haematopoietic stem cells treatment has demonstrated immunological and clinical efficacy. This article reviews the biology, clinical presentation, diagnosis and treatment of diseaseC531816.
17300989		Management options for diseaseC531816; proceedings of the EBMT satellite workshop (Hamburg, March 2006).diseaseC531816 is a disorder of chemicalC030985 salvage that has its most devastating consequences in the immune system leading to diseaseD016511 (diseaseD016511). Management options for diseaseC531816 include hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, enzyme replacement therapy and gene therapy. Formal data on the outcome following each of the three treatment modalities are limited, and this symposium was held in order to gather together the experience from major centers in Europe and the US. Transplantation for diseaseC531816 is highly successful with survival rates of approximately 90% if a matched sibling or matched related donor is available but survival following matched unrelated donor or haploidentical procedures is 63% and 50% respectively with a significant rejection/non-engraftment rate in unconditioned procedures. Successfully transplanted 9606 demonstrated good immunological recovery with normal cellular and humoral function in the majority of cases. PEG-ADA has been used in over 150 9606 worldwide either as an alternative to mismatched transplant or as a stabilizing measure prior to transplant. Overall, approximately two thirds of 9606 treated with PEG-ADA have survived with the majority of 9606 showing good clinical improvement. The level of immune recovery long term was less than that seen after transplant and approximately 50% of 9606 continued to receive immunoglobulin replacement. Gene therapy has been used as an experimental procedure in two centers in Europe. Early results from 9 9606 suggest that the treatment is safe and that the majority have shown recovery of cellular immune function. Long-term follow-up of treated 9606 highlights a significant incidence of non-immunological diseaseD019973 with diseaseD060825 most prominent.
36736952	Association|diseaseC531816|ncbi100; Association|diseaseD016511|ncbi100	Updated Management Guidelines for Adenosine Deaminase Deficiency.Inherited defects in the ncbi100 (ncbi100) gene typically cause diseaseD016511. In addition to diseaseD007239, diseaseC531816 9606 can present with neurodevelopmental, behavioral, hearing, skeletal, lung, heart, skin, kidney, urogenital, and liver abnormalities. Some 9606 also suffer from diseaseD001327 and diseaseD009369. In recent years, there have been remarkable advances in the management of diseaseC531816. Most diseaseC531816 9606 can be identified by newborn screening for diseaseD016511, which facilitates early diagnosis and treatment of asymptomatic infants. Most 9606 benefit from enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation from an HLA-matched sibling donor or HLA-matched family member donor with no conditioning is currently the preferable treatment. When matched sibling donor or matched family member donor is not available, autologous ncbi100 gene therapy with nonmyeloablative conditioning and ERT withdrawal, which is reported in recent studies to result in 100% overall survival and 90% to 95% engraftment, should be pursued. If gene therapy is not immediately available, ERT can be continued for a few years, although its excessive cost might be prohibitive. The recent improved outcome of hematopoietic cell transplantation using HLA-mismatched family-related donors or HLA-matched unrelated donors, after reduced-intensity conditioning, suggests that such procedures might also be considered rather than continuing ERT for prolonged periods. Long-term follow-up will further assist in determining the optimal treatment approach for diseaseC531816 9606.
10886203	Negative_Correlation|diseaseC531816|ncbi100; Association|chemicalD011092|ncbi100	In vitro and in vivo studies with 9606 carrier erythrocytes loaded with chemicalD011092-conjugated and native ncbi100.Polyethylene glycol-conjugated ncbi100 (pegademase) is used for enzyme replacement therapy for 9606 with diseaseD016511 caused by diseaseC531816. The entrapment of pegademase within 9606 energy-replete carrier erythrocytes using a hypo-osmotic dialysis procedure was investigated with the objective of prolonging the in vivo circulatory half-life of the enzyme and maintaining therapeutic blood levels. Native unmodified ncbi100 (ncbi100) was similarly studied. The efficiency of pegademase entrapment was low (9%) whereas the entrapment of native unmodified ncbi100 was substantial (50%), suggesting that the chemicalD011092 side-chains were impeding intracellular entrapment. The biochemical characteristics and the osmotic fragility of these carrier erythrocytes were not adversely affected by the entrapment of either pegademase or native ncbi100. In vivo survival studies of pegademase-loaded chemicalC000615375-labelled carrier erythrocytes in an diseaseC531816 adult 9606 showed a mean cell half-life of 16 d. Carrier erythrocyte-entrapped pegademase and native ncbi100 had in vivo half-lives of 20 and 12.5 d, respectively, demonstrating that entrapment prolongs the half-life over that of plasma pegademase, which has a circulating half-life of 3-6 d. These results provide the basis for a more extensive clinical evaluation of carrier erythrocyte-entrapped native ncbi100 therapy.
21624615		Gene therapy for primary diseaseD018489.Gene therapy has become an option for the treatment of 2 forms of diseaseD016511 (diseaseD016511): diseaseD053632 and diseaseC531816. The results of clinical trials initiated more than 10 years ago testify to sustained and reproducible correction of the underlying diseaseC536780. Successful treatment is based on the selective advantage conferred on T-cell precursors through their expression of the therapeutic transgene. However, "first-generation" retroviral vectors also caused diseaseD007938 in some 9606 with diseaseD053632 because of the constructs' tendency to insert into active genes (eg, proto-oncogenes) in progenitor cells and transactivate an oncogene through a viral element in the long terminal repeat. These elements have been deleted from the vectors now in use. Together with the use of lentiviral vectors (which are more potent for transducing stem cells), these advances should provide a basis for the safe and effective extension of gene therapy's indications in the field of diseaseD000081207. Nevertheless, this extension will have to be proved by examining the results of the ongoing clinical trials.
10202239		Gene therapy for diseaseD016511 caused by diseaseC531816: improved retroviral vectors for clinical trials.diseaseD016511 (diseaseD016511) caused by diseaseC531816 (diseaseC531816) is the first diseaseD030342 to be treated with gene therapy. Since 1990 when the first trial started for 2 9606 with diseaseD016511, five clinical trials enrolling 11 9606 have been conducted with different clinical approaches and the results obtained from these trials have recently been reported. According to these reports, T cell-directed gene transfer was useful in the treatment of diseaseD016511 whereas the retroviral-mediated gene transfer to hematopoietic stem cells was insufficient for achievement of clinical benefits. This chapter reviews several crucial problems inherent in the current retroviral technology based on the clinical data observed in these pioneering diseaseC531816 gene therapy trials and presents our new retroviral vector system for the next stem cell gene therapy.
12196037		Gene therapy in infants with diseaseD016511.diseaseD016511 (diseaseD016511) are rare disorders that represent paediatric medical emergencies, as the outcome for affected 9606 can easily be fatal unless proper treatment is performed. The only curative treatment for diseaseD016511 is reconstitution of the 9606's immunity. For more than 30 years, allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) has been extremely successful for diseaseD016511. However, BMT often results in only incomplete restoration of B cell function in treated 9606, especially when haploidentical donors are used. In addition, BMT can be associated with severe complications such as diseaseD006086 (diseaseD006086). Alternative forms of therapy for diseaseD016511 are therefore desirable. Genetic correction of peripheral T lymphocytes and/or haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) by retrovirally mediated gene transfer has been attempted for 9606 with diseaseD016511 due to diseaseC531816, the first diseaseD030342 targeted in clinical gene therapy trials with very limited success, overall. After these pioneer trials, recent progress has led to significant improvement of gene transfer techniques and better understanding of HSC biology which has culminated in the recent success of a gene therapy trial for 9606 affected with diseaseD053632 (diseaseD053632). In this trial, 9606 with diseaseD053632 received autologous bone marrow stem/progenitor cells which had been retrovirally transduced with a therapeutic gene. Based on the current follow-up, the overall efficacy of this gene therapy procedure is to be considered similar to or even better than that achievable by allogeneic BMT, because 9606 were not exposed to the risks of diseaseD006086. Although these exciting results have clearly demonstrated that gene therapy is a feasible therapeutic option for diseaseD053632, they have also raised important questions regarding the long-term outcome of this experimental procedure and the possibility of translating this success into applications for other forms of diseaseD016511.

Iterative improvements in vector design, HSC processing methods, and clinical HSC transplant procedures have led nearly all diseaseC531816 gene therapy patients to achieve consistently beneficial immune restoration with stable engraftment of ncbi100 gene-corrected HSC over the duration of observation (as long as 20 years). One gene therapy for diseaseC531816 is approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in the European Union (EU) and another is being advanced to licensure in the U.S. and U.K. Despite the clear-cut benefits and safety of this curative gene and cell therapy, it remains challenging to achieve sustained availability and access, especially for rare disorders like diseaseC531816.
12901330		Gene therapy for diseaseD000081207.Extensive research into gene therapy technologies has produced few clinically relevant results. Advances in the understanding of the genetics of diseaseD030342, gene transfer methodologies, and stem cell manipulation have all contributed to successes in treating diseaseD053632 and diseaseC531816. This review examines the progress and the problems that have arisen, and discusses the improvement and future of gene therapy for diseaseD000081207.

Additionally, diseaseC531816 9606 suffer from diseaseD034381. We hypothesized that diseaseC531816 (-/-) 10090 also exhibit diseaseD034381 and that ERT from an early age will improve the diseaseD034381 and diseaseD007154 in these 10090. Methods: Auditory brainstem evoked responses, organ weights, thymocytes numbers, and subpopulations, lymphocytes in peripheral blood as well as T lymphocytes in spleen were analyzed in ncbi11486-/- and ncbi11486-proficient littermate post-partum (pp). The cochlea was visualized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The effects of polyethylene glycol conjugated ncbi11486 (PEG-ncbi11486) ERT or 40% chemicalD010100 initiated at 7 days pp on the diseaseD034381 and diseaseD007154 were assessed. Results: Markedly abnormal diseaseD034381 thresholds responses were found in ncbi11486-/- 10090 at low and medium tone frequencies. SEM demonstrated extensive damage to the cochlear hair cells of ncbi11486-/- 10090, which were splayed, short or missing, correlating with the diseaseD006311. The diseaseD034381 were not reversed when diseaseD000860 in ncbi11486-/- 10090 was corrected. Progressive diseaseD007154 were detected in ncbi11486-/- 10090 from 4 days pp, initially affecting the thymus followed by peripheral lymphocytes and T cells in the spleen. ERT initiated at 7 days pp significantly improved the diseaseD034381 of ncbi11486-/- 10090 as well as the number of thymocytes and T lymphocytes, although not all normalized. Conclusions: diseaseC531816 is associated with diseaseD006311 and damage to cochlear hair cells. Early initiation of ERT improves the diseaseD034381 and diseaseD007154.
17721875		Gene therapy in The Netherlands: highlights from the Low Countries.Gene therapy is an active research area in The Netherlands and Dutch scientists involved in fundamental and clinical gene therapy research significantly contribute to the progresses made in this field. This ranges from the establishment of the 0045, 1K15 and G704 cell lines, which are used worldwide for the production of replication-defective adenoviral vectors, to the development of targeted viral vectors and T lymphocytes as well as of non-viral vectors. Several milestones have been achieved in Dutch clinical gene therapy trials, including the first treatment worldwide of 9606 with diseaseC531816 with genetically corrected hematopoietic stem cells in collaboration with French and British scientists. Until now, about 230 9606 with various diseases have been treated with viral and non-viral gene therapy in this country. Ongoing and upcoming Dutch clinical trials focus on the translation of new developments in gene therapy research, including the restoration of genetic diseaseD000013 other than diseaseD053632, and the use of oncolytic adenoviruses and targeted T cells for the treatment of diseaseD009369. The growing commercial interest in Dutch clinical gene therapy is reflected by the involvement of two Dutch companies in ongoing trials as well as the participation of Dutch clinical centres in large phase III international multicenter immuno-gene therapy trials on diseaseD011471 sponsored by an American company. Translational gene therapy research in The Netherlands is boosted at a governmental level by the Dutch Ministry of Health via a dedicated funding programme. This paper presents an overview on milestones in Dutch basic gene therapy research as well as on past, present and future clinical gene therapy trials in The Netherlands.
