35962643	Acute Cellular Rejection in A Kidney Transplant Recipient Following Vaccination with Inactivated SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine.	SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are being administered worldwide. Most of the reported side effects are mild and self-limiting with few reported cases of severe adverse reactions. Here we report a case of acute cellular rejection in a kidney transplant recipient following vaccination with an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. fifty- one years old man with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, who had received a kidney transplantation from a living related donor, 3 years ago, presented with an impaired kidney function seven days after receiving the first dose of Sinovac's COVID-19 vaccine. Kidney transplant biopsy revealed acute cellular rejection. The allograft function completely recovered after treatment with steroids. The analysis and investigation of the complications and adverse reactions induced by anti-COVID-19 vaccines, could increase our understanding of the underlying pathogenesis.  DOI: 10.52547/ijkd.6915.
28838432	Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease Transplant Recipients After Kidney Transplantation: A Single-center Experience.	Kidney transplantation is indicated for end-stage renal disease. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) causes structural degeneration of the kidney and eventually becomes end-stage renal disease. ADPKD patients usually have several renal and nonrenal complications. We analyzed our kidney transplantation activities between 1991 and 2010 regarding ADPKD. We followed up with patients to December 31, 2016. Data were collected as patient and graft survival rates, the prevalence of polycystic manifestation of the gastrointestinal tract and other organs, and the attendance of urinary tract infection. Among the 734 kidney transplantations, 10.9% (n = 80) had an ADPKD. Four patients (5%) had diverticulum perforation. The prevalence of post-transplantation urinary tract infection was higher in ADPKD patients (55.9%) compared to non-ADPKD patients (44.1%). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates in ADPKD recipients versus non-ADPKD patients are 77.5%, 70.0%, and 67.5% versus 86.4%, 83.0%, and 80.1%, respectively. Patients with ADPKD were transplanted at an elder age compared to others (median: 47.5 years vs. 39.9 years). Female patients had longer graft survival times than males. ADPKD implies multiple cystic degeneration of the kidneys; however, it can cause structural degeneration in other organs. It is typical for ADPKD patients to have an acute abdominal-like syndrome. Immunosuppressive drugs can hide the clinical picture, which makes early diagnosis difficult.
31309115	Bilateral Nephrectomy for Adult Polycystic Kidney Disease Does Not Affect the Graft Function of Transplant Patients and Does Not Result in Sensitisation.	BACKGROUND: Native nephrectomy in Adult Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) patients is a major operation with controversy related to timing and indications. We present our single centre experience in transplanted patients and future candidates for transplantation. METHODS: Retrospective analysis from an anonymised database of bilateral nephrectomies for ADPKD patients. Results were reported as median, range, and percentage. Differences between groups were tested using ANOVA and t-test. Surgery was performed between January 2012 and July 2018. RESULTS: Thirty-three patients underwent bilateral native nephrectomy for APKD. 18 had a functioning kidney transplant (transplant group, 55%) while 15 patients were on dialysis (dialysis group, 45%) at the time of surgery; 8 patients of the latter group (24% of the whole cohort) were eventually transplanted. 53% were males, with median age of 55 years (27-71). Indications to surgery were the following: space (symptoms related to the size of the native kidneys or need to create space for transplantation) (59%), recurrent cyst infection (36%), haematuria (15%), pain (24%), and weight loss associated with cystic alteration on imaging (3%). In the transplant group, postoperative kidney function was not affected; haemoglobin serum levels significantly dropped in the whole cohort: 121 (82-150) g/L, versus 108 (58-154) g/L (p<0.001), with 14 patients being transfused perioperatively. Elevation of anti-HLA antibodies was noted in one female patient on dialysis, with no change in DSA levels and no rejection after transplant for all 26 transplanted patients. Median postoperative length of hospital stay was 9 days (6-71). One patient died (3%) after six months. Median follow-up for the whole cohort was 282 days (13-1834). Histopathological examination revealed incidental renal neoplasms in five cases (15%): 1 pT1a papillary renal cell carcinoma and 4 papillary adenomas. CONCLUSIONS: Native nephrectomy for ADPKD could be safely performed in case of refractory symptoms, suspect of cancer or to create space for transplantation. It does not affect graft function or DSA status of transplanted patients or the prospect of transplantation of those on the waiting list.
30127334	Intravascular Renal Denervation in Renal Dialysis Patients with Uncontrolled Hypertension: A Case Series of Four Patients.	BACKGROUND Hypertension is a common complication of renal dialysis and is inadequately controlled in approximately one-third of patients. Intravascular renal denervation is an option to control sympathetic overdrive and decrease blood pressure. Four renal dialysis patients are presented with uncontrolled hypertension who were treated with intravascular renal denervation. CASE REPORT In a renal dialysis unit, patients were screened for therapy-resistant hypertension, which was defined as an outpatient blood pressure >160/100 mmHg and a blood pressure by interdialytic ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) >130/80 mmHg. Four patients were identified with a mean ABPM of 175/95 mmHg. The four patients included a 24-year-old man with neurogenic bladder undergoing hemodialysis; a 55-year-old woman with a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus undergoing peritoneal dialysis; a 56-year-old woman with a history of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) undergoing peritoneal dialysis; and a 72-year-old man with a history of ADPKD undergoing hemodialysis Following intravascular renal denervation, one patient had antihypertensive medicines withdrawn at 12 months, and he remained normotensive up to renal transplantation at 24 months. In two patients, ABPM did not decrease until renal transplantation was performed. The fourth patient was not a candidate for renal transplantation, and he was also a non-responder for intravascular renal denervation. None of the patients experienced hypotension or other adverse events following intravascular renal denervation. CONCLUSIONS A case series of four patients showed that, for some patients who have unresponsive hypertension while on renal dialysis, intravascular renal denervation is a safe procedure.
26338918	Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease and Intracranial Aneurysms: Is There an Increased Risk of Treatment?	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is associated with an increased risk of intracranial aneurysms. Our purpose was to assess whether there is an increased risk during aneurysm coiling and clipping. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were obtained from the National Inpatient Sample (2000-2011). All subjects had an unruptured aneurysm clipped or coiled and were divided into polycystic kidney (n = 189) and control (n = 3555) groups. Primary end points included in-hospital mortality, length of stay, and total hospital charges. Secondary end points included the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes for iatrogenic hemorrhage or infarction; intracranial hemorrhage; embolic infarction; and carotid and vertebral artery dissections. RESULTS: There was a significantly greater incidence of iatrogenic hemorrhage or infarction, embolic infarction, and carotid artery dissection in the patients with polycystic kidney disease compared with the control group after endovascular coiling. There was also a significantly greater incidence of iatrogenic hemorrhage or infarction in the polycystic kidney group after surgical clipping. However, the hospital stay was not longer in the polycystic kidney group, and the total hospital charges were not higher. Additional analysis within the polycystic kidney group revealed a significantly shorter length of stay but similar in-hospital costs when subjects underwent coiling versus clipping. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with polycystic kidney disease face an increased risk during intracranial aneurysm treatment, whether by coiling or clipping. This risk, however, does not translate into longer hospital stays or increased hospital costs. Despite the additional catheterization-related risks of dissection and embolization, coiling results in shorter hospital stays and similar mortality compared with clipping.
27595512	Renal angiomyolipoma bleeding in a patient with TSC2/PKD1 contiguous gene syndrome after 17 years of renal replacement therapy.	We report the case of a 32-year-old male diagnosed with TSC2/PKD1 contiguous gene syndrome, presenting with tuberous sclerosis (TS) and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease simultaneously. He progressed to end-stage renal disease and received a kidney transplant at the age of 12. The native kidneys presented angiomyolipomas (AML), which are common benign tumours in patients with TS. Seventeen years after transplantation, he presented with abdominal pain, anaemia and a retroperitoneal haematoma, the latter caused by renal AML bleeding. Selective embolisation was performed. Our patient could have benefited from the administration of mTOR inhibitors at transplant. This therapy is immunosuppressive and reduces the size of benign tumours in TS as well as the risk of rupture and bleeding. This patient did not receive mTOR inhibitors at the time of the transplant because the relationship between mTOR inhibitors and TS was unknown at that time. This case confirms the persistent risk of renal AML bleeding for both transplanted patients and patients on dialysis. As a result, we would recommend routine check-ups of native kidneys and nephrectomy assessment.
30879585	Caroli Disease Revisited: A Case of a Kidney Transplant Patient With Autosomal Polycystic Kidney Disease and Recurrent Episodes of Cholangitis.	Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a genetic disorder leading to end-stage renal disease more commonly in the fourth to sixth decades of life. Cyst formation in the kidneys and other organs such as the liver and pancreas is the main characteristic of this disease. A significant number of patients with PKD undergo kidney transplantation and receive significant immunosuppression, predisposing them to comorbidities such as infections and malignancies. The link between these cystic syndromes and Caroli disease (which is radiologically demonstrated as bile duct ectasia, segmental cystic dilation of intrahepatic bile ducts, with a normal common bile duct and absence of hepatic fibrosis or portal hypertension), is extremely important. Suspicion, screening, and timely diagnosis of the presence of Caroli disease in patients with PKD prior or post receiving a kidney transplant will reduce morbidity in these patients and possibly prolong both graft and patient survival. We describe a patient with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease who underwent recurrent admissions for presumed cholangitis and was eventually diagnosed with Caroli disease.
28088190	Total kidney and liver volume is a major risk factor for malnutrition in ambulatory patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.	BACKGROUND: In patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), malnutrition may develop as renal function declines and the abdominal organs become enlarged. We investigated the relationship of intra-abdominal mass with nutritional status. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was performed at a tertiary hospital outpatient clinic. Anthropometric and laboratory data including serum creatinine, albumin, and cholesterol were collected, and kidney and liver volumes were measured. Total kidney and liver volume was defined as the sum of the kidney and liver volumes and adjusted by height (htTKLV). Nutritional status was evaluated by using modified subjective global assessment (SGA). RESULTS: In a total of 288 patients (47.9% female), the mean age was 48.3 +- 12.2 years and the mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 65.3 +- 25.3 mL/min/1.73 m2. Of these patients, 21 (7.3%) were mildly to moderately malnourished (SGA score of 4 and 5) and 63 (21.7%) were at risk of malnutrition (SGA score of 6). Overall, patients with or at risk of malnutrition were older, had a lower body mass index, lower hemoglobin levels, and poorer renal function compared to the well-nourished group. However, statistically significant differences in these parameters were not observed in female patients, except for eGFR. In contrast, a higher htTKLV correlated with a lower SGA score, even in subjects with an eGFR >=45 mL/min/1.73 m2. Subjects with an htTKLV >=2340 mL/m showed an 8.7-fold higher risk of malnutrition, after adjusting for age, hemoglobin, and eGFR. CONCLUSIONS: Nutritional risk was detected in 30% of ambulatory ADPKD patients with relatively good renal function. Intra-abdominal organomegaly was related to nutritional status independently from renal function deterioration.
25125090	Laparoscopic pretransplant nephrectomy with morcellation in autosomic-dominant polycystic kidney disease patients with end-stage renal disease.	BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic nephrectomy (LN) in end-stage autosomic-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) requires a large abdominal incision for the specimen extraction. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to describe our technique of LN for end-stage ADPKD followed by morcellation (LNM) of the specimen and extraction through a minimal abdominal incision. METHODS: The medical records of 19 consecutive patients who underwent pretransplant LNM between 2008 and 2011 by a single experienced laparoscopic surgeon were analyzed. Morcellation was performed with the Gynecare Morcellex  Tissue morcellator, Ethicon. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: All cases but one were completed laparoscopically. Mean specimen weight was 1,026.8 g. Mean duration of the procedure, estimated blood loss, and hospital stay were 131.3 min, 52.1 ml, and 7.9 days, respectively. Specimens were extracted through a 12-mm trocar in 10/18 patients and through a 3-cm incision in 9/18 cases. Postoperatively, three complications were observed (Clavien grades II, I, and II). The only case of incisional hernia was observed in the converted procedure. Major limitation of the study is its retrospective design. CONCLUSIONS: In our preliminary series and in the hands of a very experienced laparoscopist, LNM for ADPKD appears as a modern, mini-invasive, and safe technique. Specimen's extraction through a small abdominal incision reduces postoperative pain and incisional hernias and guarantees the final cosmetic result of laparoscopy. The reduced overall morbidity could reduce the period between nephrectomy and transplantation.
31264086	The ideal position of the peritoneal dialysis catheter is not always ideal.	PURPOSE: Peritoneal catheter dysfunction is a frequent complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD). Traditionally, dysfunction has been attributed to catheter malposition, but whether the location of the catheter tip in the small pelvis really determines proper function is unclear. METHODS: We reviewed 900 abdominal X-ray images of PD patients from a 7-year period in two PD units that use different catheter types (straight and Swan Neck Curled). RESULTS: In 52% of the images, the dialysis catheter tip was located in the ideal position in the small pelvis and in 48% in other sites. Peritoneal catheter function was normal at the time of imaging in 87% of those with ideal catheter tip position, and in 74% of those with other than ideal position. The tip was located in small pelvis in 35% of images performed during catheter dysfunction and in 56% of those performed during normal catheter function. There were no differences between two catheter types. The positive predictive value of abdominal X-ray images to predict catheter function was 26%, and the negative predictive value 87%. We also found a significant positive correlation between polycystic kidney disease and normal catheter function. In contrast, obese patients were more likely to have catheter malfunction. Previous abdominal surgery was not associated with catheter dysfunction. CONCLUSION: Our data showed a higher probability of normal function of peritoneal catheters whose tips were located in the small pelvis. However, also malpositioned catheters generally functioned well, and malpositioning of the PD catheter did not in itself explain its malfunction.
32858084	Simultaneous Hand-assisted Laparoscopic Bilateral Native Nephrectomy and Kidney Transplantation for Patients With Large Polycystic Kidneys.	OBJECTIVE: To describe our technique of simultaneous hand-assisted laparoscopic bilateral native nephrectomy (BNN) and kidney transplantation (KT) in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and present our experience. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed a cohort of adult ESRD patients with symptomatic autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease who underwent a hand-assisted laparoscopic BNN at the time of KT. We reviewed patients' and donor characteristics, and perioperative and postoperative outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 52 patients underwent hand-assisted laparoscopic BNN at the time of KT from January 2014 to October 2019. The median age of the recipients was 53.4 years, 57.7% were males, and the median body mass index was 29.0 kg/m2. All but one received a kidney from a living donor and the majority (86.5%) were pre-emptive. One patient required a small bowel resection due to an intraoperative small bowel injury. There was no solid organ injury during the procedure. All patients showed immediate allograft function and a steady decline in serum creatinine. The median decline in the creatinine and hemoglobin on day 1 was 1.2 mg/dL (inter quartile range 0.6-2.3) and 2.2 g/dL (inter quartile range 1.4-3.0), respectively. CONCLUSION: Simultaneous hand-assisted laparoscopic bilateral nephrectomy with KT through a modified Gibson incision is feasible and safe in the hands of an experienced laparoscopic surgeon without compromising allograft function.

24699013	Safety and feasibility of dobutamine stress cardiac magnetic   resonance for cardiovascular assessment prior to   renal transplantation.	AIMS: Current guidelines recommend cardiovascular risk assessment prior to renal transplantation. There is currently no evidence for the role of cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) in this population, despite an established evidence base in the non-chronic kidney disease (CKD) population. Our aim is to determine the feasibility and safety of dobutamine stress CMR (DSCMR) imaging in the risk stratification of CKD patients awaiting renal transplantation. METHODS: CKD patients who were deemed at high risk for coronary artery disease (CAD) and awaiting renal transplantation underwent DSCMR. RESULTS: Forty-one patients whose median age was 56 years (range 28-73 years) underwent DSCMR. Nineteen were undergoing haemodialysis, 10 peritoneal dialysis and 12 pre-dialysis. The aetiology of the renal failure was diabetes mellitus in 29%, glomerulonephritis in 24%, hypertension in 22% and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease in 10%. Thirty-eight patients (93%) achieved the end point, either positive for ischaemia or negative, achieving at least 85% of age-predicted heart rate. Two of them did not achieve target heart rate and one was discontinued because of severe headache. Of the 38 patients who achieved the end point, 35 (92%) were negative for inducible wall motion abnormalities and four (10%) were positive. There were no serious adverse effects. CONCLUSION: DSCMR is a well tolerated and viable investigation for the cardiovascular risk stratification of high-risk CKD patients prior to renal transplantation. DSCMR already has an established evidence base in the non-CKD population with superiority over other noninvasive techniques. Larger studies with outcome data are now required to define its true utility in the CKD population.
30476226	A Large Database Analysis of Rates of Aneurysm Screening, Elective Treatment, and Subarachnoid Hemorrhage in Patients With Polycystic Kidney Disease.	BACKGROUND: Professional societies provide conflicting guidelines on aneurysm screening in patients with polycystic kidney disease (PKD), and the rate of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate screening, elective treatment, and the rate of SAH in patients with known PKD. METHODS: We examined longitudinally linked claims data from a large private insurer, identifying screening, elective treatment, aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) and secured aneurysmal SAH (saSAH) in 2004 to 2014 amongst patients with known PKD. RESULTS: We identified 20 704 patients diagnosed with PKD. Among patients with an initial PKD diagnosis, 51/446 (15.9%) underwent angiographic screening within 2 yr. Forty aneurysms were treated electively in 48 868 yr at risk in PKD patients (82/100K patient yr, 95% confidence interval [CI] 60-112) vs 24 elective treatments in 349 861 yr at risk in age- and sex-matched controls (7/100K patient yr, 95% CI 5-10, P < .0001). Eleven admissions for aSAH were identified in PKD patients (23/100K patient yr, 95% CI 13-41) and 22 admissions for aSAH in controls (6/100K patient yr, 95% CI 4-10), giving an incidence rate ratio (IRR) of 3.6 (95% CI 1.7-7.4, P < .0001) and a comorbidity-adjusted IRR of 3.1 (95% CI 1.4-6.9). The incidence of saSAH was proportionally even higher in PKD patients than controls, 16 vs 2/100K patient years, IRR 9.5 (95% CI 3.3-27.5, P < .0001). CONCLUSION: Screening in PKD is performed only selectively, though resulting rates of elective treatment were over 10x those of controls. Despite screening and treatment, the rate of SAH remains significantly elevated over that of controls.
32771247	ABO-Incompatible Living Donor Kidney Transplantation in a Human Immunodeficiency Virus-Positive Recipient From a Human Immunodeficiency Virus-Positive Donor: A Case Report.	A human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is no longer an absolute contraindication for solid organ transplantation, yet such a setting is still challenging and little explored because of general reservations and medical difficulties. We describe a 51-year-old man with end-stage renal failure due to polycystic kidney disease who underwent an ABO-incompatible kidney transplantation from his 49-year-old male partner. Early postoperative course revealed an episode of suspected acute rejection, which was successfully managed with a steroid pulse. Both donor and recipient continued to have an undetectable viral load after adjusting antiretroviral medication to renal function. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a successful ABO-incompatible living donor kidney transplantation from an HIV-positive donor in an HIV-positive recipient, and this case seems to be a valuable approach with favorable results.
27178833	Dynamics of the erythropoiesis stimulating agent resistance index in incident hemodiafiltration and high-flux hemodialysis patients.	Hyporesponsiveness to erythropoiesis-stimulating agent therapy in dialysis patients is poorly understood. Some studies report an improvement in the erythropoiesis-stimulating agent resistance index (ERI) with hemodiafiltration (HDF) versus high-flux hemodialysis (HD). We explored ERI dynamics in 38,340 incident HDF and HD patients treated in 22 countries over a 7-year period. Groups were matched by propensity score at baseline (6 months after dialysis initiation). The follow-up period (mean of 1.31 years) was stratified into 1 month intervals with delta analyses performed for key ERI-related parameters. Dialysis modality, time interval, and polycystic kidney disease were included in a linear mixed model with the outcome ERI. Baseline ERI was nonsignificantly higher in HDF versus HD treatment. ERI decreased significantly faster in HDF-treated patients than in HD-treated patients, was decreased in both HD and HDF when patients were treated with intravenous darbepoetin alfa, but only in HDF when treated with intravenous recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO). A clear difference between HD- and HDF-treated patients could only be found for patients with high baseline ERI and assigned to intravenous rHuEPO treatment. A significant advantage in terms of lower ERI for patients treated by HDF was found. Sensitivity analysis limited this advantage for HDF to those patients treated with intravenous rHuEPO (not darbepoetin alfa or subcutaneous rHuEPO) and to patients with a high baseline ERI. Thus, our results allow more accurate planning for future clinical trials addressing anemia management in dialysis patients.
26968474	Renal embolization.	Recent developments in endovascular radiological techniques and devices make embolization as a major therapeutic option in many renal vascular or neoplastic diseases, before surgery. These techniques show a very good efficacy with a low morbidity and a better renal tolerance. Indications of embolization in nephrology are post-biopsy arteriovenous fistulas, renal graft intolerance, functional exclusion and polycystic kidney disease before transplantation. Others are at the interface between nephrology and urology as angiomyolipomas (mostly in tuberous sclerosis context), arterial aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations.

38303642	Survival of Infants With Severe Congenital Kidney Disease After ECMO and Kidney Support Therapy.	Congenital kidney failure not only affects the homeostatic functions of the kidney, but also affects neonatal respiratory integrity. Until recently, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support was not used in this population because the need for ECMO clearly established nonviability. Since 2016, 31 neonates have been admitted to the NICU at Children's of Alabama with congenital kidney failure. Five patients were placed on ECMO for severe respiratory distress unresponsive to conventional interventions. We evaluated neonates with congenital kidney failure and pulmonary hypoplasia/hypertension refractory to conventional therapies who received ECMO support within the first 9 postnatal days. We describe the pre and postnatal diagnoses, ECMO course details, dialysis modalities, complications, procedures, and long-term outcomes of these patients. All 5 patients received kidney support therapy by postnatal day 7. Diagnoses included posterior urethral valves, bilateral renal dysplasia, and autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease. Gestational age ranged from 35.6 to 37.1 weeks. Birth weight ranged from 2740 to 3140 g. Days on ECMO ranged from 4 to 23. Four survived and are living today. Pulmonary hypertension resolved in surviving patients. Three surviving patients require no oxygen support, and 1 patient requires nocturnal oxygen. Three survivors received a kidney transplant, and 1 awaits transplant evaluation. Patients with congenital kidney failure with severe pulmonary hypoplasia/pulmonary hypertension no longer warrant a reflexive assignment of nonviability. Meticulous ECMO, respiratory, nutritional, and kidney support therapies may achieve a favorable long-term outcome. Further investigation of strategies for optimal outcome is needed.
30820006	Genotype-Clinical Correlations in Polycystic Kidney Disease with No Apparent Family History.	BACKGROUND: Genetic characteristics of polycystic kidney disease (PKD) patients without apparent family history were reported to be different from those with a positive family history. However, the clinical course of PKD patients with no apparent family history is not well documented in the literature. METHODS: We evaluated the relationship between genotype and the clinical course of 62 PKD patients with no apparent family history. RESULTS: The annual decline of renal function was faster in the patients with PKD1/PKD2 mutation (PKD1 truncating [-3.08; 95% CI -5.30 to -0.87, p = 0.007], PKD1 nontruncating [-2.10; -3.82 to -0.38, p = 0.02], and PKD2 [-2.31; -4.40 to -0.23, p = 0.03]) than in the other patients without PKD1/PKD2 mutation. Similar results were obtained after adjustment for gender, age, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), height-adjusted total kidney volume (TKV), and mean arterial pressure (MAP). There was no significant difference in the annual decline of renal function among the different PKD1/PKD2 groups, but Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that progression to eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 was significantly faster in PKD1 truncating group (p = 0.05). The annual rate of TKV increase was larger in the patients with PKD1/PKD2 mutation (PKD1 truncating [4.63; 95% CI 0.62-8.64, p = 0.03], PKD1 nontruncating [3.79; 0.55-7.03, p = 0.02], and PKD2 [2.11; -1.90 to 6.12, p = 0.29]) than in the other patients without PKD1/PKD2 mutation. Similar results were obtained after adjustment for gender, age, eGFR, and MAP. CONCLUSION: Detection of PKD1/PKD2 mutation, especially PKD1 truncating, is useful for predicting the renal outcome and rate of TKV increase in PKD patients with no apparent family history.
31694039	Glucose and Lipid Metabolism Abnormalities among Patients with Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease.	INTRODUCTION: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most prevalent monogenic renal disease with a prevalence of 1:1,000 births and it is the 4th most common cause of dialysis-dependent end-stage renal disease (ESDR). Recent reports suggest an association between APDKD and metabolic derangements, particularly impaired glucose metabolism. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study we analyzed data obtained from case records of 189 patients with ADPKD, including kidney transplant recipients, managed in an outpatient department. RESULTS: The mean BMI was 25.4 +- 3.9; 25.25 before and 27.7 after transplan-tation. A fasting glucose level above 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) was observed in 60 patients (29%) - 27% without transplantation and 41% kidney transplant recipients. Diabetes mellitus was diagnosed in 17 patients (8.9%), including 3 (2.3%) without a history of transplantation and 14 (24.1%) after kidney transplantation (p < 0.01). We observed dyslipidemia in 30% and hyperuricemia in 53% of patients. CONCLUSION: Demonstrated metabolic abnormalities should be considered in maintenance of ADPKD patients, including kidney transplant recipients.

30171755	[Preimplantation genetic diagnosis for infertile males with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease].	OBJECTIVE: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is one of the most common genetic renal diseases, which may cause oligoasthenospermia and azoospermia and result in male infertility. This study aimed to analyze the outcomes of preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) in male patients with ADPKD-induced infertility. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data on 7 male patients with ADPKD-induced infertility undergoing PGD from April 2015 to February 2017, including 6 cases of oligoasthenospermia and 1 case of obstructive azoospermia, all with the PKD1 gene heterozygous mutations. Following intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), we performed blastomere biopsy after 5 or 6 days of embryo culture and subjected the blastomeres to Sureplex whole-genome amplification, followed by haplotype linkage analysis, Sanger sequencing, array-based comparative genomic hybridization to assess the chromosomal ploidy of the unaffected embryos, and identification of the unaffected euploid embryos for transfer. RESULTS: One PGD cycle was completed for each of the 7 patients. Totally, 26 blastocysts were developed, of which 12 were unaffected and diploid. Clinical pregnancies were achieved in 6 cases following 7 cycles of frozen embryo transplantation, which included 5 live births and 1 spontaneous abortion. CONCLUSIONS: For males with ADPKD-induced infertility, PGD may contribute to high rates of clinical pregnancy and live birth and prevent ADPKD in the offspring as well. This finding is also meaningful for the ADPKD patients with normal fertility.
29471960	Overview of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease in the south of Spain.	INTRODUCTION: Although autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is the most common hereditary kidney disease, available data tend to be limited to after initiation of renal replacement therapy. OBJECTIVE: To ascertain an overview of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease within the health area of Granada in southern Spain. MATERIAL AND METHODS: From January 2007 to December 2016, we collected clinical, family and demographic information about all patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, irrespective of whether or not they were treated with RRT, in the Granada health area. The computer software SPSS 15.0 and GenoPro were used. RESULTS: 50.6% of the 1,107 diagnosed patients were men. 99.1% were Caucasian and 4-6 generations/family were studied. The geographical distribution was heterogeneous. There was no family history in 2.43%. The mean age of diagnosis was 34.0+-17.80 years and the diagnosis was made after having offspring in 57.7% of cases. The main reason for diagnosis was family history (46.4%). The mean age of initiation of renal replacement therapy was 54.2+-11.05 years. 96.3% of the deceased had some degree of renal failure at the time of death. The mean age of death was 60.9+-14.10 years, the main cause of death being unknown in 33.5% of cases, followed by cardiovascular (27.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Cases and families were concentrated in certain geographical areas and a significant number of individuals were undiagnosed prior to cardiovascular death or diagnosed late after reproduction. Given that there is currently no curative treatment, the primary prevention strategy of preimplantation genetic diagnosis should play a leading role.
29529969	Subclavian steal syndrome in a hemodialysis patient after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of arteriovenous access.	INTRODUCTION: We describe a hemodialysis patient who developed subclavian steal syndrome via an arteriovenous fistula after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 55-year-old female with end-stage renal failure due to polycystic kidney disease had been treated with hemodialysis for 10 years. Because of an autologous arteriovenous fistula stenosis, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty was performed. After successful treatment with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, the patient developed dizziness. Magnetic resonance imaging with angiography of the brain and neck revealed normal bilateral subclavian and carotid arteries. However, flow in the left vertebral artery was not detected in time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography. The left vertebral artery showed completely reversed blood flow as detected by color duplex ultrasound. We also confirmed anterograde flow in the left vertebral artery by color duplex ultrasound with arteriovenous fistula compression. Arteriovenous flows before the arteriovenous fistula stenosis and post-percutaneous transluminal angioplasty were 1146 and 2239 mL/min, respectively. These findings suggested high-flow arteriovenous fistula led to the subclavian steal syndrome. The patient was subsequently treated by a flow reduction in the high-flow arteriovenous access using a modified graft inclusion technique. We decreased the arteriovenous fistula flow to 851 mL/min, which remained under 850 mL/min, 1 year later. The brain natriuretic peptide level and right-ventricular pressure also decreased after treatment. A modified graft inclusion technique was successful in decreasing the high flow of the arteriovenous fistula, and improved subclavian steal syndrome symptom and cardiac overload. CONCLUSION: This case shows that percutaneous transluminal angioplasty for an arteriovenous fistula may induce subclavian steal syndrome, and a modified graft inclusion technique was useful in improving the high flow of an arteriovenous fistula.
28098112	Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease: Study of clinical characteristics in an Indian population.	Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common hereditary form of kidney disease. Clinical data on this multisystem disorder are scarce from developing countries. We conducted a prospective observational study of the clinical profile of ADPKD patients at a single center over a period of six years. A total of 208 patients were studied. Majority were male (60.6%) and the mean age was 45.8 +- 14.5 years. About 61.5% had early stage (Stages 1-3) of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and 38.5% had advanced CKD (Stages 4 and 5). Clinical features observed included pain abdomen (46.2%), nocturia (65.9%), hematuria (21.6%), nephrolithiasis (38.9%), urinary tract infection (UTI) (38.9%), hypertension (69.5%), and raised serum creatinine (54.3%). The prevalence of nocturia, hypertension, and renal dysfunction showed a significant increase with age (P = 0.001). Extrarenal manifestations were polycystic liver disease in 77 patients (37%), cysts in pancreas in two (1%), and stroke in three (1.5%) (hemorrhage in 2 and infarct in 1). There was significantly higher prevalence of hypertension (P = 0.027) and nephrolithiasis (P = 0.044) in males compared to females. Ninety-two patients (44.2%) had a positive family history for ADPKD. Fifteen (7.2%) had kidney failure at the diagnosis of ADPKD, were hospitalized, and underwent emergency dialysis. A total of 20 patients (9.6%) developed end-stage kidney disease during the study period. The age at diagnosis was higher, and there was a high prevalence of hypertension, nocturia, abdominal pain, nephrolithiasis, UTI, and renal dysfunction in Indian ADPKD patients.
31405737	Mucormycosis Presented with Facial Pain in a Renal Transplant Patient: A Case Report.	INTRODUCTION: Mucormycosis is a severe infection in renal transplant recipients. Here, we report a case of maxillary sinus mucormycosis in a patient who presented with a facial pain complaint. CASE: A 51-year-old female patient with renal transplantation due to autosomal dominant, polycystic kidney disease and diabetic nephropathy was admitted to our hospital with facial pain and minimal edema of the left half of her face on the 8th month of transplantation. On physical examination, there was only tenderness and slight edema on the left half of the face. On the paranasal computed tomography, extensive soft tissue densities involving septations, filling the left maxillary sinus, extending to the nasal cavity, and obliterating the left osteometeal unit were observed. Because facial pain was not relieved by antibiotics and several, potent analgesic drugs on the second day, mucormycosis infection with bone involvement was suspected. A left maxillary sinus excision was performed. Microscopic examination of the debridement specimen revealed necrotic bone interspersed with fungal hyphae, and culture isolated Rhizopus oryzae. Liposomal amphotericin B was started. The patient was on tacrolimus, prednisolone, and mycophenolate mofetil. Tacrolimus was switched to cyclosporine to regulate serum glucose levels. The left maxillary sinus was washed with liposomal amphoterin B daily and curetted with intervals. The patient started dialysis because of severe renal function loss. The patient was discharged on the 96th day of liposomal amphotericin B. CONCLUSION: It should be kept in mind that mucormycosis may be present in the sinuses even if there is no evidence for nasal, oral, and dental examination in renal transplant patients with facial pain.
29753540	Risk Factors for Early Dialysis Dependency in Autosomal Recessive Polycystic Kidney Disease.	OBJECTIVE: To identify prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal risk factors for dialysis within the first year of life in children with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) as a basis for parental counseling after prenatal and perinatal diagnosis. STUDY DESIGN: A dataset comprising 385 patients from the ARegPKD international registry study was analyzed for potential risk markers for dialysis during the first year of life. RESULTS: Thirty-six out of 385 children (9.4%) commenced dialysis in the first year of life. According to multivariable Cox regression analysis, the presence of oligohydramnios or anhydramnios, prenatal kidney enlargement, a low Apgar score, and the need for postnatal breathing support were independently associated with an increased hazard ratio for requiring dialysis within the first year of life. The increased risk associated with Apgar score and perinatal assisted breathing was time-dependent and vanished after 5 and 8 months of life, respectively. The predicted probabilities for early dialysis varied from 1.5% (95% CI, 0.5%-4.1%) for patients with ARPKD with no prenatal sonographic abnormalities to 32.3% (95% CI, 22.2%-44.5%) in cases of documented oligohydramnios or anhydramnios, renal cysts, and enlarged kidneys. CONCLUSIONS: This study, which identified risk factors associated with onset of dialysis in ARPKD in the first year of life, may be helpful in prenatal parental counseling in cases of suspected ARPKD.
34753590	Allogeneic Kidney Transplantation After COVID-19: A Case Report.	BACKGROUND: Patients undergoing organ transplantation are immunosuppressed and already at risk of various diseases. We report about a patient who underwent ABO-incompatible kidney transplantation after coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) without a recurrence of infection. CASE REPORT: A 68-year-old woman presented with end-stage renal failure owing to primary autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease; accordingly, hemodialysis was initiated in September 2020. Her medical history included bilateral osteoarthritis, lumbar spinal stenosis, hypertension, and hyperuricemia. In mid-January 2021, she contracted severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection from her husband. Both of them were hospitalized and received conservative treatment. Because their symptoms were mild, they were discharged after 10 days. The patient subsequently underwent ABO-incompatible kidney transplantation from her husband who recovered from COVID-19 in March 2021. Before kidney transplantation, her COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction test was negative, confirming the absence of pre-existing COVID-19 immediately before the procedure. Computed tomography revealed no pneumonia. Initial immunosuppression was induced by administering tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, methylprednisolone, basiliximab, rituximab, and 30 g of intravenous immunoglobulin. Double-filtration plasmapheresis and plasma exchange were performed once before ABO-incompatible kidney transplantation. The renal allograft functioned immediately, and the postoperative course was normal without rejection. COVID-19 did not recur. In addition, her serum creatinine levels and renal function had otherwise remained stable. CONCLUSION: Living kidney transplantation was safely performed in a patient with COVID-19 without postoperative complications or rejection. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the possibility of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection during transplantation surgery must be considered.
36328815	Experience and Utility of the Protocol Kidney Biopsy in the First Year of Kidney Transplantation.	BACKGROUND: Protocol kidney biopsy (PKB) in kidney transplant is a useful tool for graft monitoring because the subclinical detection of histologic lesions helps to modulate immunosuppression. We analyze our experience. METHODS: We performed a descriptive study that analyzed the PKB results at the fourth to sixth month and the first year post transplant of patients with kidney transplant followed in our hospital between January 2015 and June 2021. RESULTS: A total of 100 patients and 134 biopsy results were included, of which 71 were obtained between the fourth and sixth month and 63 at the first year. The mean age was 57.8 years, and 66% were men. Unknown etiology was the most common underlying kidney disease (31%), followed by diabetes mellitus (15%) and polycystic kidney disease (14%). A total of 80% had panel-reactive antibody < 50%. Induction therapy consisted of thymoglobulin (51%) and basiliximab (49%), and maintenance therapy consisted of corticosteroids and tacrolimus (100%), mycophenolate mofetil (82%), and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor (18%). Of the total of the PKB results (n = 134), 19 episodes of subclinical rejection (14%) and 10 with borderline changes (7.4%) were observed. Regarding other findings, there were cases of nephrocalcinosis (4.4%), immunoglobulin A nephropathy (2.2%), and BK nephropathy (1.5%). The PKB brought about a change in the therapeutic attitude in 45 cases (33%) of the total number of biopsies, the most frequent change being the administration of boluses of methylprednisolone (12.6%) and the change to mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor (8.9%). CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, PKB is a useful tool for monitoring and evaluating histologic changes without clinical expression in the kidney graft, allowing us to adapt the treatment during the first year of kidney transplant.
31862175	Tips for TIPS: A combined percutaneous and transjugular approach for intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement after liver transplant.	A 39-year-old female, liver transplanted for Autosomic Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) developed refractory ascites early after surgery, with frequent need of large-volume paracentesis. This was associated with severe sarcopenia and kidney impairment. Liver biopsy showed a sinusoidal congestion with a significant enlargement of hepatic portal veins. This picture suggested the diagnosis of vascular obstructions. Due to an unfavorable passage through the piggy-back surgical anastomosis and the angle between the hepatic veins and the portal branches, a conventional placement of a transjugular portosystemic shunt (TIPS) was not feasible. An alternative approach was pursued with success, using a combined percutaneous-transjugular approach and achieving a complete recovery of ascites, sarcopenia and renal function.
26318985	Native Nephrectomy with Renal Transplantation is Associated with a Decrease in Hypertension Medication Requirements for Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease.	PURPOSE: We assessed hypertensive control after native nephrectomy and renal transplantation in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood pressure control was studied retrospectively in 118 patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease who underwent renal transplantation between 2003 and 2013. Overall 54 patients underwent transplantation alone (group 1) and 64 underwent transplantation with concurrent ipsilateral nephrectomy (group 2). Of these 64 patients 32 underwent ipsilateral nephrectomy only (group 2a) and 32 underwent eventual delayed contralateral native nephrectomy (group 2b). The number of antihypertensive drugs and defined daily dose of each antihypertensive was recorded at transplantation and up to 36-month followup. RESULTS: Comparing preoperative to postoperative medications at 12, 24 and 36-month followup, transplantation with concurrent ipsilateral nephrectomy had a greater decrease in quantity (-1.2 vs -0.5 medications, p=0.008; -1.1 vs -0.3, p=0.007 and -1.2 vs -0.4, p=0.03, respectively) and defined daily dose of antihypertensive drug (-3.3 vs -1.0, p=0.0008; -2.9 vs -1.0, p=0.006 and -2.7 vs -0.6, p=0.007, respectively) than transplantation alone at each point. Native nephrectomy continued to be a predictor of hypertensive requirements on multivariable analysis (p <0.0001). The mean decrease in number of medications in group 2b from after ipsilateral nephrectomy to 12 months after contralateral nephrectomy was -0.6 (p=0.0005) and the mean decrease in defined daily dose was -0.6 (p=0.009). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease undergoing renal transplantation, concurrent ipsilateral native nephrectomy is associated with a significant decrease in the quantity and defined daily dose of antihypertensive drugs needed for hypertension control. Delayed contralateral native nephrectomy is associated with improved control of blood pressure to an even greater degree.
35246327	Early Referral, Living Donation, and Preemptive Kidney Transplant.	BACKGROUND: Preemptive kidney transplant (PKT) is recognized as the most beneficial and cost-effective form of renal replacement therapy among patients with end-stage renal disease. Despite optimal outcomes and improved quality of life associated with PKT, its use as a first renal replacement therapy remains low among patients with end-stage renal disease. The goal of this retrospective cohort study was to compare, among adult kidney transplant recipients, characteristics across PKT status. METHODS: We compared the characteristics of patients who did and did not have a PKT over 5 years, from 2010 to 2014, using the electronic health records of Kaiser Permanente Mid-Atlantic States. RESULTS: A total of 233 patients received a kidney-alone transplant, and, of these, 44 patients (19%) were PKT and 189 patients (81%) were non-PKT. Of the patients in the PKT group, 43% received a kidney from a deceased donor. PKT recipients were more often White, had polycystic kidney disease or glomerulonephritis, received a living donor organ, and were transplanted at certain transplant centers. Estimated glomerular filtration rate on listing for those who received a deceased donor transplant was higher in PKT than non-PKT patients listed pre-dialysis. CONCLUSIONS: PKT was associated with having a living kidney donor and with having a higher estimated glomerular filtration rate at listing for deceased donor recipients.
27935534	Representativeness of Honeypot Trial Participants to Australasian PD Patients.	BACKGROUND: The HONEYPOT trial failed to establish the superiority of exit-site application of Medihoney compared with nasal mupirocin prophylaxis for the prevention of peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. This study aimed to assess the representativeness of the patients in the HONEYPOT trial to the Australian and New Zealand PD population. METHODS: This study compared baseline characteristics of the 371 PD patients in the HONEYPOT trial with those of 6,085 PD patients recorded on the Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant (ANZDATA) Registry. RESULTS: Compared with the PD population, the HONEYPOT sample was older (standardized difference [d] = 0.19, p = 0.003), more likely to be treated with automated PD (d = 0.58, p < 0.001), had higher residual renal function (d = 0.26, p < 0.001) and a higher proportion of participants with end-stage kidney disease due to polycystic kidney disease (d = 0.17) and lower proportion due to diabetes (d = -0.17) and glomerulonephritis (d = -0.18) (p < 0.001), and lower proportions of indigenous people (d = -0.17, p < 0.001), current smokers (d = -0.10, p < 0.001), and people with prior histories of hemodialysis (d = -0.16, p < 0.001), diabetes mellitus (d = -0.18, p < 0.001), and coronary artery disease (d = -0.15, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: HONEYPOT trial participants tended to be healthier than the Australian and New Zealand PD patient population. Although the differences between the groups were generally modest, it is possible that their cumulative effect may have had some impact on external generalizability, which is not an uncommon occurrence in clinical trials.
31138820	Clinical courses and complications of young adults with Autosomal Recessive Polycystic Kidney Disease (ARPKD).	Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) is a severe pediatric hepatorenal disorder with pronounced phenotypic variability. A substantial number of patients with early diagnosis reaches adulthood and some patients are not diagnosed until adulthood. Yet, clinical knowledge about adult ARPKD patients is scarce. Here, we describe forty-nine patients with longitudinal follow-up into young adulthood that were identified in the international ARPKD cohort study ARegPKD. Forty-five patients were evaluated in a cross-sectional analysis at a mean age of 21.4 (+-3.3) years describing hepatorenal findings. Renal function of native kidneys was within CKD stages 1 to 3 in more than 50% of the patients. Symptoms of hepatic involvement were frequently detected. Fourteen (31%) patients had undergone kidney transplantation and six patients (13%) had undergone liver transplantation or combined liver and kidney transplantation prior to the visit revealing a wide variability of clinical courses. Hepatorenal involvement and preceding complications in other organs were also evaluated in a time-to-event analysis. In summary, we characterize the broad clinical spectrum of young adult ARPKD patients. Importantly, many patients have a stable renal and hepatic situation in young adulthood. ARPKD should also be considered as a differential diagnosis in young adults with fibrocystic hepatorenal disease.
32986687	Renal cystic diseases during the perinatal and neonatal period.	Renal cystic diseases are a clinically and genetically diverse group of renal diseases that can manifest in utero, infancy, or throughout childhood and adulthood. These diseases may be unilateral or bilateral with a single cyst or multiple cysts, or with increased echogenicity of the renal cortex without macroscopic cysts. Certain cystic renal diseases are life-threatening, with many developing chronic kidney and hepatic disease if not recognized early enough. Therefore, due to the prevalence and life-altering complications of this specific group of diseases in vulnerable populations, it is crucial for clinicians and healthcare providers to have an overall understanding of cystic diseases and how to pre-emptively detect and manage these conditions. In this review, we discuss in detail the epidemiology, genetics and pathophysiology, diagnosis, presentation, and management of numerous genetic and sporadic renal cystic diseases, such as polycystic kidney disease, multicystic dysplastic kidney, and calyceal diverticula, with an emphasis on prenatal care and pregnancy counseling.

29150711	Epidemiology of peritonitis following maintenance peritoneal dialysis catheter placement during infancy: a report of the SCOPE collaborative.	BACKGROUND: Maintenance peritoneal dialysis (PD) is the dialysis modality of choice for infants and young children. However, there are limited outcome data for those who undergo PD catheter insertion and initiate maintenance PD within the first year of life. METHODS: Using data from the Children's Hospital Association's Standardizing Care to Improve Outcomes in Pediatric End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Collaborative (SCOPE), we examined peritonitis rates and patient survival in 156 infants from 29 North American pediatric dialysis centers who had a chronic PD catheter placed prior to their first birthday. RESULTS: In-hospital and overall annualized rates of peritonitis were 1.73 and 0.76 episodes per patient-year, respectively. Polycystic kidney disease was the most frequent renal diagnosis and pulmonary hypoplasia the most common co-morbidity in infants with peritonitis. Multivariable regression models demonstrated that nephrectomy at or prior to PD catheter placement and G-tube insertion after catheter placement were associated with a nearly sixfold and nearly threefold increased risk of peritonitis, respectively. Infants with peritonitis had longer initial hospital stays and lower overall survival (86.3 vs. 95.6%, respectively; P < 0.02) than those without an episode of peritonitis. CONCLUSIONS: In this large cohort of infants with ESRD, the frequency of peritonitis was high and several risk factors associated with the development of peritonitis were identified. Given that peritonitis was associated with a longer duration of initial hospitalization and increased mortality, increased attention to the potentially modifiable risk factors for infection is needed.
36220371	Recurrent urinary tract infections in kidney transplant patients with polycystic kidneys.	INTRODUCTION: Kidney transplantation is now a routine method used to treat end-stage renal disease. About 10 % of kidney transplant patients are patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). After successful kidney transplantation, recurrent urinary tract infections also occur in initially asymptomatic patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The group included 320 patients after kidney transplantation. We compared patients with ADPKD versus patients without ADPKD in terms of the presence of recurrent urinary tract infections. THE RESULTS: The incidence of recurrent urinary tract infections (rIMCs) was 18% in patients without ADPKD and 48% in patients without ADPKD. Nephrectomy after kidney transplantation due to recurrent urinary tract infections eliminated this infectious complication (in 86% of patients). CONCLUSION: Kidney transplant patients with ADPKD have a significantly higher incidence of recurrent urinary tract infections. Removal of polycystic kidneys is a suitable solution if the infection persists.
33377673	[Simultaneous laparoscopic bilateral nephrectomy as a preparation for kidney transplantation in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease].	AIM: to study the possibility and safety of performing simultaneous bilateral laparoscopic nephrectomy in symptomatic patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) as a preparation for kidney transplantation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From May 2018 to September 2019, six symptomatic patients with end-stage renal disease caused by ADPKD, who had hemodialysis, underwent simultaneous bilateral laparoscopic nephrectomy. The mean vertical kidney size according to CT data was 211.67+/-37.15 mm, the mean horizontal size was 145.36+/-19.53 mm. In 5 cases, the hand-assisted procedure was performed. RESULTS: The average duration of the procedure was 225.1+/-40.37 minutes. Postoperative complications were recorded in 2 (33.2%) patients. The average length of stay was 8.83+/-2.13 days. There were no clinical manifestations of adrenal insufficiency. All patients are alive. In two patients, cadaveric kidney transplantation was performed after laparoscopic bilateral nephrectomy. CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic bilateral nephrectomy in patients with chronic renal failure associated with ADPKD is feasible, safe and is associated with a short length of stay. This procedure improves the quality of life of patients and facilitates subsequent kidney transplantation.
32048571	Long-term aneurysm recurrence and de novo aneurysm formation after surgical treatment of unruptured intracranial aneurysms: a cohort study and systematic review.	Objective: There is a relative lack of literature on long-term aneurysm recurrence and de novo aneurysm formation following surgical treatment of unruptured intracranial aneurysms. This retrospective single-center cohort study, therefore, analyzes the incidence of aneurysm recurrence, and the incidence of de novo aneurysms formation in patients with at least 10yrs of radiological follow-up. The data are put into the context of a systematic review of the literature.Methods: Patients that underwent surgical treatment of an unruptured intracranial aneurysm at the Basel University Hospital were retrospectively identified. The rate of recurrent or de novo aneurysm formation was assessed for all patients with imaging follow-up >=10yrs. A systematic review including studies with a mean follow-up period of >=10yrs was then performed.Results: A total of 95 patients had undergone surgical treatment of an unruptured intracranial aneurysm between 1994 and 2008. Twenty-one patients (22.1%) had available imaging follow-up >=10yrs (mean: 13.1yrs). In these patients, aneurysm recurrence and de novo aneurysm formation were equally found in 23.8% (n = 5; 1.8%/yr). There was no case of aneurysm rupture from a recurrent or a de novo aneurysm. The systematic literature review covered a combined cohort of 1778 patients over a mean follow-up period of 14.0yrs. In this cohort, the aneurysm recurrence rate was 16.4% (0.7%/yr), and the rate of de novo aneurysm formation was 6.2% (0.4%/yr).Discussion: Despite some discrepancy regarding the incidence, both cohorts show a non-negligible long-term risk of aneurysm recurrence and de novo aneurysm formation, which warrants life-long imaging follow-up.Abbreviations: SD: standard deviation; DSA: digital subtraction angiography; CTA: computed tomography angiography; MRA: magnetic resonance angiography; MCA: middle cerebral artery; ACA: anterior cerebral artery; ACommA: anterior communicating artery; ICA: internal carotid artery; ADPKD: autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease; MeSH: Medical Subject Headings.
28825164	The mutation-free embryo for in vitro fertilization selected by MALBAC-PGD resulted in a healthy live birth from a family carrying PKD 1 mutation.	BACKGROUND: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD, autosomal dominant PKD or adult-onset PKD) is the most prevalent and potentially lethal kidney disease that is hereditary and lacks effective treatment. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) of embryos in assistant reproductive technology (ART) helps to select mutation-free embryos for blocking ADPKD inheritance from the parents to their offspring. However, there are multiple pseudogenes in the PKD1 coding region, which make blocking ADPKD inheritance by PGD complicated and difficult. Therefore, this technique has not been recommended and used routinely to ADPKD family plan. METHODS AND RESULTS: Here, we report a new strategy of performing PGD in screening (target-) mutation-free embryos. We firstly used a long-range PCR amplification and next generation sequencing to identify the potential PKD1 mutant(s). After pathogenic variants were detected, multiple annealing and looping-based amplification cycles (MALBAC), a recently developed whole genome amplification method, was used to screen embryo cells. We successfully distinguished the mutated allele among pseudogenes and obtained mutation-free embryos for implantation. The first embryo transfer attempt resulted in a healthy live birth free of ADPKD condition and chromosomal anomalies which was confirmed by aminocentesis at week 18 of gestation, and by performing live birth genetic screening. CONCLUSIONS: The first MALBAC-PGD attempt in ADPKD patient resulted in a healthy live birth free of ADPKD and chromosomal anomalies. MALBAC-PGD also enables selecting embryos without aneuploidy together and target gene mutation, thereby increasing implantation and live birth rates.
25498068	Negative impact of underlying non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus nephropathy on long-term allograft survival in kidney transplantation: a 10-year analysis from a single center.	INTRODUCTION: We analyzed the relationship between underlying nephropathy and long-term outcomes in kidney transplant recipients. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data from 678 patients who underwent kidney transplantation (KTx) between 1998 and 2011. Recipients with 13 major nephropathies were evaluated for graft and patient survival, and causes of graft loss. RESULTS: The best 10-year graft survival rates (100%) were in the patients with autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease, preeclampsia, Alport syndrome, and purpura nephritis. The worst rate (50.8%) was in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus nephropathy (NIDDMN; P = .039). Causes of graft-loss in the NIDDM patients included chronic rejection (6 cases), acute rejection (3 cases), infection (2 cases), and cardiovascular event (2 cases). Significant risk factors for graft loss were donor age (P < .01) and NIDDMN (P < .01). CONCLUSION: Underlying NIDDMN before KTx was a significant risk factor for long-term graft function. Immunologic factors and nonimmunologic factors influenced the long-term outcomes in patients with underlying NIDDMN.
26053633	Laparoscopic Nephrectomy versus Open Nephrectomy for Patients with Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.	OBJECTIVE: To compare efficacy and safety of laparoscopicnephrectomy (LN) versus open nephrectomy (ON) in the management of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: A systematic search of the electronic databases PubMed, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library was performed up to October 2014. This systematic review was performed based on observational comparative studies that assessed the two techniques. The weighted mean difference (WMD) and risk ratio (RR), with their corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI), were calculated to compare continuous and dichotomous variables, respectively. RESULTS: Seven studies were identified, including 195 cases (118 LN/77 ON). Although LN was associated with longer operative time (WMD 30.236, 95%CI 14.541 -45.932, P<0.001) and the specimen might not have been resected as heavy as the ON group (WMD -986.516, 95%CI -1883.24--89.795, P = 0.031), patients in this group might benefit from a shorter length of hospital stay (WMD -3.576, 95%CI 4.976--2.176, P <0.001), less estimated blood loss (WMD -180.245, 95%CI -317.939--42.556, P = 0.010), and lower need of transfusion (RR 0.345, 95%CI 0.183-0.650, P = 0.001). The LN group also had less overall complications (RR 0.545, 95%CI 0.329-0.903, P = 0.018). The need of narcotic analgesics between the two groups might have no significant difference (WMD -54.66, 95%CI -129.76-20.44, P = 0.154). CONCLUSION: LN for giant symptomatic ADPKD was feasible, safe and efficacious. Morbidity was significantly reduced compared with the open approach. For an experienced laparoscopist, LN might be a better alternative.
38618918	Investigational agents for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease: preclinical and early phase study insights.	INTRODUCTION: Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) is the most common inherited kidney condition caused by a single gene mutation. It leads patients to kidney failure in more than 50% of cases by the age of 60, and, given the dominant inheritance, this disease is present in the family history in more than 90% of cases. AREAS COVERED: This review aims to analyze the set of preclinical and early phase studies to provide a general view of the current progress on ADPKD therapeutic options. Articles from PubMed and the current status of the trials listed in clinicaltrials.gov were examined for the review. EXPERT OPINION: Many potential therapeutic targets are currently under study for the treatment of ADPKD. A few drugs have reached the clinical phase, while many are currently still in the preclinical phase. Organoids could be a novel approach to the study of drugs in this phase. Other than pharmacological options, very important developing approaches are represented by gene therapy and the use of MiRNA inhibitors.
36939917	Low agreement between various eGFR formulae in pediatric and young adult ADPKD patients.	BACKGROUND: Young autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) patients are becoming the new target population for the development of new treatment options. Determination of a reliable equation for estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) from early stages is needed with the promising potential interventional therapies. METHODS: Prospective and longitudinal study on a cohort of 68 genotyped ADPKD patients (age range 0-23 years) with long-term follow-up. Commonly used equations for eGFR were compared for their relative performance. RESULTS: The revised Schwartz formula (CKiD) showed a highly significant decline in eGFR with aging (- 3.31 mL/min/1.73 m2/year, P < 0.0001). The recently updated equation by the Schwartz group (CKiDU25) showed a smaller (- 0.90 mL/min/1.73 m2/year) but significant (P = 0.001) decline in eGFR with aging and also showed a significant sex difference (P < 0.0001), not observed by the other equations. In contrast, the full age spectrum (FAS) equations (FAS-SCr, FAS-CysC, and the combined) showed no age and sex dependency. The prevalence of hyperfiltration is highly dependent on the formula used, and the highest prevalence was observed with the CKiD Equation (35%). CONCLUSIONS: The most widely used methods to calculate eGFR in ADPKD children (CKiD and CKiDU25 equations) were associated with unexpected age or sex differences. The FAS equations were age- and sex-independent in our cohort. Hence, the switch from the CKiD to CKD-EPI equation at the transition from pediatric to adult care causes implausible jumps in eGFR, which could be misinterpreted. Having reliable methods to calculate eGFR is indispensable for clinical follow-up and clinical trials. A higher resolution version of the Graphical abstract is available as Supplementary information.
26166166	Efficacy of 4 Years of Octreotide Long-Acting Release Therapy in Patients With Severe Polycystic Liver Disease.	OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect on total liver volume (TLV) on and off therapy in selected symptomatic patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) or autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease (PLD) who received octreotide long-acting release (OctLAR) for up to 4 years. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-eight of 42 participants in a prospective 2-year clinical trial of OctLAR (40 mg monthly) consisting of double-blind, randomized (year 1) and open-label treatment (year 2) phases reenrolled in a 2-year open-label extension (OLE) study after being off OctLAR a mean of 8.3 months (original study: July 1, 2007, through June 30, 2013). Participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging at baseline, years 1 and 2, reenrollment, and study completion. Primary end point: change in TLV; secondary end points: changes in total kidney volume, glomerular filtration rate, quality of life (QoL), safety, vital signs, and laboratory parameters. RESULTS: Twenty-five participants (59.5%) completed the OLE. Off therapy, TLVs increased a mean +- SD of 3.4%+-8.2% per year; after resuming therapy, TLVs decreased a mean +- SD of -4.7%+-6.1% per year. Despite regrowth off treatment, overall reductions were observed, with a median (interquartile range) TLV of 4047 mL (3107-7402 mL) at baseline and 3477 (2653-7131 mL) at study completion (-13.2%; P<.001) and with improved health-related QoL. Total kidney volumes increased, and glomerular filtration rates declined from 58.2 mL/min to 54.5 mL/min (n=16) in patients with ADPKD on therapy from baseline to study completion. CONCLUSION: Therapy with OctLAR over 4 years in selected patients with symptomatic PLD arrested PLD progression, alleviating symptoms and improving health-related QoL. Discontinuation led to organ regrowth. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00426153.
39273390	Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate Signaling in Chronic Kidney Disease: Molecular Targets and Therapeutic Potentials.	Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is characterized by a steady decline in kidney function and affects roughly 10% of the world's population. This review focuses on the critical function of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signaling in CKD, specifically how it influences both protective and pathogenic processes in the kidney. cAMP, a critical secondary messenger, controls a variety of cellular functions, including transcription, metabolism, mitochondrial homeostasis, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. Its compartmentalization inside cellular microdomains ensures accurate signaling. In kidney physiology, cAMP is required for hormone-regulated activities, particularly in the collecting duct, where it promotes water reabsorption through vasopressin signaling. Several illnesses, including Fabry disease, renal cell carcinoma, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, Bartter syndrome, Liddle syndrome, diabetic nephropathy, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, and renal tubular acidosis, have been linked to dysfunction in the cAMP system. Both cAMP analogs and phosphodiesterase inhibitors have the potential to improve kidney function and reduce kidney damage. Future research should focus on developing targeted PDE inhibitors for the treatment of CKD.
29208045	Joubert's syndrome and related disorders and home-based peritoneal dialysis in East Africa: a case report.	BACKGROUND: Joubert's syndrome is a rare condition affecting an estimated 1:80,000-1:100,000 individuals. There is underdevelopment of the cerebellar vermis resulting in a characteristic molar tooth sign on cross sectional axial magnetic resonance imaging. It can occur in association with multi-organ involvement; in such cases it is classified as Joubert's syndrome and related disorders. To date, there are no cases of Joubert's syndrome and related disorders from sub-Saharan Africa described in the literature. CASE PRESENTATION: An 8 year old black Kenyan female child was diagnosed in Joubert's syndrome in her first year of life. She was noted to have dysmorphic facies and hypotonia in the neonatal period and cranial MRI showed dysplasia of the cerebellar vermis and typical molar tooth malformation. She was subsequently lost to follow up for several years and later presented with anaemia. Further investigation revealed bilateral multicystic kidneys and significant renal impairment consistent with a diagnosis of end stage renal failure and polycystic kidney disease. She underwent home peritoneal dialysis for 7 months. CONCLUSIONS: Joubert's syndrome and related disorders is a rare condition. This case report demonstrates that home peritoneal dialysis is feasible in a low resource setting. Although it is scarcely provided in African countries, it is an effective renal replacement strategy for patients with end stage renal disease.
27695033	An Empirical Biomarker-Based Calculator for Cystic Index in a Model of Autosomal Recessive Polycystic Kidney Disease-The Nieto-Narayan Formula.	Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) is associated with progressive enlargement of the kidneys fuelled by the formation and expansion of fluid-filled cysts. The disease is congenital and children that do not succumb to it during the neonatal period will, by age 10 years, more often than not, require nephrectomy+renal replacement therapy for management of both pain and renal insufficiency. Since increasing cystic index (CI; percent of kidney occupied by cysts) drives both renal expansion and organ dysfunction, management of these patients, including decisions such as elective nephrectomy and prioritization on the transplant waitlist, could clearly benefit from serial determination of CI. So also, clinical trials in ARPKD evaluating the efficacy of novel drug candidates could benefit from serial determination of CI. Although ultrasound is currently the imaging modality of choice for diagnosis of ARPKD, its utilization for assessing disease progression is highly limited. Magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography, although more reliable for determination of CI, are expensive, time-consuming and somewhat impractical in the pediatric population. Using a well-established mammalian model of ARPKD, we undertook a big data-like analysis of minimally- or non-invasive blood and urine biomarkers of renal injury/dysfunction to derive a family of equations for estimating CI. We then applied a signal averaging protocol to distill these equations to a single empirical formula for calculation of CI. Such a formula will eventually find use in identifying and monitoring patients at high risk for progressing to end-stage renal disease and aid in the conduct of clinical trials.
26718164	KHA-CARI Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease Guideline: Management of End-Stage Kidney Disease.	
35470994	[Lymphocytic leukopenia in two patients affected by polycystic kidney disease waiting for renal transplantation].	Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common hereditary kidney disease, responsible for 10% of patients on renal replacement therapy. The disease is well known to be associated with many extrarenal manifestations. Leukopenia may also be present, even if it is not commonly identified as a typical extrarenal manifestation. Herein we describe two case reports of ADPKD patients with leukopenia. The first case is about a 47-year-old patient affected by ADPKD, regularly treated with peritoneal dialysis, who showed a progressive reduction of white blood cell count, mostly of lymphocytes. Lymphocytic leukopenia was so severe that, when he was called for transplantation from a deceased donor, he was considered temporarily not eligible. We then describe a second ADPKD patient regularly treated with peritoneal dialysis, who had stable lymphopenia for years. Six years after starting PD, it was necessary to perform bone marrow aspirate to investigate the simultaneous presence of hypogammaglobulinemia together with M-protein and to exclude monoclonal gammopathy. All the exams performed did not show any significant results, the patients were re-included in the waiting list and one of them was transplanted. Given our experience and what is reported in the literature, there seems to be enough evidence to consider leukopenia as an extrarenal manifestation of ADPKD. However, the clinical significance of leukopenia in ADPKD patients is not known. It could be interesting to investigate the leucocytes' function and if ADPKD patients with leukopenia are more susceptible to infection, or not. Moreover, it would be very useful to analyze the relationship between such manifestation and genotype/phenotype.
31747008	Unilateral nephrectomy versus renal arterial embolization and technique survival in peritoneal dialysis patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.	BACKGROUND: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a common genetic disorder associated with progressive enlargement of the kidneys and liver. ADPKD patients may require renal volume reduction, especially before renal transplantation. The standard treatment is unilateral nephrectomy. However, surgery incurs a risk of blood transfusion and alloimmunization. Furthermore, when patients are treated with peritoneal dialysis (PD), surgery is associated with an increased risk of temporary or definitive switch to haemodialysis (HD). Unilateral renal arterial embolization can be used as an alternative approach to nephrectomy. METHODS: We performed a multicentre retrospective study to compare the technique of survival of PD after transcatheter renal artery embolization with that of nephrectomy in an ADPKD population. We included ADPKD patients treated with PD submitted to renal volume reduction by either surgery or arterial embolization. Secondary objectives were to compare the frequency and duration of a temporary switch to HD in both groups and the impact of the procedure on PD adequacy parameters. RESULTS: More than 700 patient files from 12 centres were screened. Only 37 patients met the inclusion criteria (i.e. treated with PD at the time of renal volume reduction) and were included in the study (21 embolized and 16 nephrectomized). Permanent switch to HD was observed in 6 embolized patients (28.6%) versus 11 nephrectomized patients (68.8%) (P = 0.0001). Renal artery embolization was associated with better technique survival: subdistribution hazard ratio (SHR) 0.29 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12-0.75; P = 0.01]. By multivariate analysis, renal volume reduction by embolization and male gender were associated with a decreased risk of switching to HD. After embolization, a decrease in PD adequacy parameters was observed but no embolized patients required temporary HD; the duration of hospitalization was significantly lower [5 days [interquartile range (IQR) 4.0-6.0] in the embolization group versus 8.5 days (IQR 6.0-11.0) in the surgery group. CONCLUSIONS: Transcatheter renal artery embolization yields better technique survival of PD in ADPKD patients requiring renal volume reduction.
29024476	Prevalence and outcomes of cystic lesions of the transplant pancreas: The University of Wisconsin Experience.	Literature on the behavior of cystic lesions in pancreas transplants is scarce, and hence a better understanding is warranted. Data on recipients and their respective donors that underwent simultaneous kidney and pancreas, pancreas transplant alone, and pancreas after kidney between 1994 and 2015 were reviewed (n = 1185). Cystic lesions of the transplant pancreas developed in 22 patients (1.8%): 12 pseudocysts, 2 cysts/remnants, 4 intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN), 2 adenocarcinomas, 1 low-grade intraepithelial pancreatic neoplasia, and 1 case of polycystic kidney disease. The median size was 3.6 cm (1.6-5.5 cm), and occurred at a median time of 65.5 months (2-183 months) posttransplant. The median age of the graft at time of diagnosis was 42 years (25.7-54.5), with 17 of 22 grafts (77%) functioning at time of diagnosis. Triggers for investigation were elevations in pancreatic enzymes, re-admissions for abdominal pain, and incidentalomas. High-resolution imaging and diagnostic biopsy/aspiration with ancillary tests were the main diagnostic tests. Most pseudocysts were managed by percutaneous drainage, and although no firm inference can be made from such a small series, we have observed that the behavior and management of IPMN and adenocarcinoma in the pancreas graft appears congruent to that of the native pancreas.
32841944	Intraperitoneal Pressure in Polycystic and Non-Polycystic Kidney Disease Patients, Treated by Peritoneal Dialysis.	INTRODUCTION: Intraperitoneal volume (IPV) should be individualized and aimed to maintain an intraperitoneal pressure (IPP) lower than 17 cm H2O. IPP is very variable, given its relation with body size. However, it is not yet fully understood which anthropometric variable mostly affects IPP and the relation between IPP and organomegaly in polycystic kidney disease (PKD) patients is not known. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to analyse the relation between antropometric variables and IPP in a large cohort of peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients and to identify if a relation between nephromegaly and IPP exists in PKD patients. METHODS: IPP was measured in PD patients and data was retrospectively collected. In PKD patients, total kidney volumes were measured in CT scans, and normalized with height (hTKV). RESULTS: Seventy-seven patients were included in the study, 18% affected by PKD. Mean IPP was 14.9 +- 2.9 cm H2O and it showed significant positive correlation with body mass index (BMI; rho = 0.42, p < 0.001). No correlation was found between IPP and absolute IPV; conversely, IPP has a significant inverse correlation with IPV normalized with BMI and body surface area (rho -0.38, p = 0.001 and rho -0.25, p = 0.02, -respectively). Patients with IPP >17 cm H2O have significant larger BMI and lower IPV/BMI compared to those with IPP <17 cm H2O (29 +- 3.6 vs. 26 +- 4 kg/m2, p < 0.05 and 97 +- 15.5 vs. 109 +- 22 mL/kg/m2, p < 0.05). PKD patients have a wide variability in hTKV (range 645-3,787 mL/m2) and it showed a significant correlation with IPP/IPV (rho = 0.6, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with larger BMI have greater IPP, irrespectively to IPV. In PKD patients, hTKV correlate with IPP/IPV ratio. However, given the wide range of distribution of hTKV, increased IPP cannot be presumed because of pre-existing polycystic kidney, but need to be quantified.
34643492	Clinical characteristics of Slovenian pediatric patients with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease.	AIMS: Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) is a rare inherited disease. We reviewed the clinical characteristics, management, and outcomes in Slovenian pediatric patients with ARPKD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients with ARPKD who were treated at the Pediatric Nephrology Department of the University Children's Hospital in Ljubljana between 1980 and 2020 were included in the study. The data were assessed retrospectively by reviewing the patients' medical records and analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: We included 13 patients, 6 boys and 7 girls. A prenatal diagnosis was established in 3 (23%) patients. In 4 (31%) patients, the diagnosis was confirmed within the first few days of life, while in 6 (46%) patients the disease manifested later during childhood. Four babies (31%) needed ventilatory support after birth. Arterial hypertension developed in all patients. Liver function was affected in 12 (92%) patients and was the predominant clinical concern in 2 of them. Two (15%) patients presented with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Portal hypertension was found in 7 (54%) patients. Initial sonography revealed enlarged kidneys in 12 (92%) patients, hyperechoic kidneys or poor cortico-medullary differentiation in 10 (77%), and liver abnormalities in 5 (38%) patients. Unilateral nephrectomy was necessary before dialysis in 1 patient. Six (46%) patients started maintenance dialysis at an average age of 15.3 years. Kidney transplantation was performed in 2 (15%) and liver transplantation in 1 (8%) patient. Two (15%) patients died because of sepsis or respiratory failure. CONCLUSION: ARPKD is a progressive disease leading to ESRD and renal replacement treatment in almost half of our patients. Our data confirm the phenotypic variability of ARPKD in Slovenian patients.
35780280	Gender-specific differences in hemodialysis patients: a multicenter longitudinal study from Serbia.	PURPOSE: The study was undertaken with the aim to determine gender-specific differences in incident hemodialysis (HD) patient and their changes over time. METHODS: The retrospective longitudinal closed cohort study involved 441 incident patients starting HD in 2014 and followed for 1-59 (median 43, IQR 40) months. Demographic, clinical data, treatment characteristics, laboratory findings and outcome were abstracted from the patients' medical records. RESULTS: The relative number of males on HD was about twice that of females throughout the five years investigated. At the beginning of the study, no significant differences were found in the main demographic and clinical characteristics except that diabetes was more often the underlying disease in men than in women. Systolic blood pressure decreased over time significantly more in females than in males. Throughout the study spKt/V was significantly higher in females than in males, but it increased in patients of both genders. There were no gender differences for comorbidities, vascular access and the majority of laboratory findings except for higher serum levels of creatinine and CRP in men than in women. Relatively more females were treated with erythropoiesis stimulating agents and phosphate binders than males. Age and malignancy were selected as significant predictors of mortality for both genders, and, in addition, polycystic kidney disease, serum level of albumin and CRP for men, but spKt/V for women. CONCLUSION: Some significant gender differences were observed throughout, while others appeared during the study but none of them were due to gender inequalities in the applied treatment.
37132326	Effects of very low carbohydrate ketogenic diets on skeletal health.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Very low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (KD) therapy has been associated with skeletal demineralization in children with drug-resistant epilepsy, but the cause of this association is unclear. Recently, interest in the KD has grown owing to its potential benefits for other illnesses including cancer, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and polycystic kidney disease. Summaries of the best available evidence regarding effects of a KD on skeletal health are lacking. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent rodent studies found that a KD can harm the growing skeleton, which corroborates most but not all studies in pediatric patients. Proposed mechanisms include chronic metabolic acidosis and depressed osteoanabolic hormones. Relative to other weight-reducing diets, a weight-reducing KD for treatment of obesity and/or type 2 diabetes in adults has not been associated with adverse skeletal effects. By contrast, recent evidence suggests that adaptation to a eucaloric KD may impair bone remodeling in elite adult athletes. Discrepancies in the literature may relate to differences between study populations and in diet formulation. SUMMARY: Attention to skeletal health is warranted when using KD therapy given the uncertainty in the literature and suggestive harms in certain populations. Future research should focus on potential mechanisms of injury.
32293406	Simultaneous bilateral femoral neck fractures in a dialysis-dependent patient: case report and literature review.	BACKGROUND: Simultaneous bilateral femoral neck fractures are extremely rare without obvious injury. Herein, we report the case of a patient on dialysis presenting with bilateral femoral neck fractures, which is a condition with high complication and mortality rates according to a review of the pertinent literature. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case a 47-year-old female with a history of 8 years of haemodialysis due to polycystic kidney disease who presented with bilateral hip pain during walking. The clinical history and results of physical and radiographic examinations of this patient are shown. Single-stage bilateral hemiarthroplasty was performed after a multidisciplinary team consultation. Three days after the operation, she could ambulate with a walker. The woman gradually regained her previous ability to walk over 6 months after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: A multidisciplinary team consultation for perioperative management is necessary and effective in patients on dialysis. Early diagnosis with prompt surgical treatment could lead to favourable recovery.
38729449	Repeated human leukocyte antigens eplets, importance of typing the partner.	INTRODUCTION: Antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) is the most common cause of immune-mediated allograft failure after kidney transplant and impacts allograft survival. Previous sensitization is a major risk factor for development of donor specific antibodies (DSA). AMR can have a wide range of clinical features such as impaired kidney function, proteinuria/hypertension or can be subclinical. HLA molecules have specific regions of antigens binding antibodies called epitopes and eplets are considered essential components responsible for immune recognition. We present a patient with subclinical AMR 1 week post transplantation. CASE REPORT: A 48-year-old, caucasian woman with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) secondary to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) on peritoneal dialysis was registered in deceased donor waitlist. She was a hypersensitized patient from 3 prior pregnancies with a calculated panel reactive antibody of 93,48%. She was transplanted through kidney paired exchange donation with no evidence of DSA pre transplantation. Surgery and post-op were unremarkable with excellent and immediate graft function. Per protocol DSA levels on the 5th day was DR1 of 3300 MFI, with an increase in MFI by day 13 with 7820 MFI and a new B41 1979MFI. Allograft kidney biopsy findings were diagnostic of AMR and she was treated with immunoglobulin and plasmapheresis. As early onset AMR post transplantation was observed an anamnestic response was hypothesized from a previous exposure to allo-HLA. We decided to type her husband, her son's father, which was presented with DSA. Mismatch eplet analysis revealed a shared 41 T and 67LQ eplets between the donor and husband, responsible for the reactivity and new HLA class I B41 and HLA class II DR1 DSA, respectively. DISCUSSION: Shared eplets between the patient husband and donor was responsible for the alloimmune response and early development of DSAs. This case highlights the importance of early monitoring DSA levels in highly sensitized patients after transplant in order to promptly address and lower inflammatory damage. Mismatch eplet analysis can provide a thorough and precise evaluation of immune compatibility providing a useful technique to immune risk stratification, donor selection and post-transplant immunosuppressive therapy and monitoring.
32599666	Treatment of recurrent urinary tract infections in a 60-year-old kidney transplant recipient. The use of phage therapy.	We would like to demonstrate the difficulty of treatment in a patient after kidney transplantation (KTX) who developed chronic urinary tract infection (UTI) with a multi-drug resistant ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae. The patient underwent several treatment interventions including supportive therapy with bacteriophages. This article presents a case of a 60-year-old patient after KTX repeatedly admitted to the hospital with recurrent UTIs caused by ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae showing variable susceptibility to carbapenems and full susceptibility to colistin only. KTX was performed due to renal insufficiency caused by polycystic kidney disease. The patient experienced 12 severe episodes of UTI due to K pneumoniae within 15 months since transplantation. In an attempt to curb the ongoing infections, phage therapy (PT) was applied on the experimental basis, coordinated by the Phage Therapy Unit of the Hirszfeld Institute in Wroclaw, Poland. Eventually, the patient fully recovered following nephrectomy of his own left kidney where cysts were the suspected reservoir of bacteria. The patient completed 29 days of PT. PT caused no reported side effects in the described case of the KTX recipient, although its role in controlling chronic UTI caused by K pneumoniae is unclear. More studies are needed in the population of kidney transplant recipients.
25230989	Survival after arterial embolization therapy in patients with polycystic kidney and liver disease.	BACKGROUND: Transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) has become a therapeutic option for symptomatic polycystic kidney disease (PKD) and polycystic liver disease (PLD). However, factors affecting survival with renal TAE remain unknown. METHODS: All symptomatic patients with severe PKD and/or PLD who received renal and/or hepatic TAE at our center from October 1996 through March 2013 (n = 1,028) were followed until death. Their survival was compared with that of the general PKD population on dialysis in Japan. Factors affecting survival were analyzed using the Cox hazard model. RESULTS: After renal TAE, 5- and 10-year survival was, respectively, 0.78 (95% confidence interval, 0.74-0.82) and 0.56 (0.49-0.63); with hepatic TAE, 0.69 (0.58-0.77) and 0.41 (0.22-0.60); and with dual TAE (renal and hepatic), 0.82 (0.72-0.88) and 0.45 (0.31-0.59). Survival after dialysis initiation was better among patients with renal TAE than among general PKD patients. Factors affecting survival after renal TAE were age [hazard ratio (HR) 3.02 (1.44-6.33) for every 10 years] and albumin [HR 0.70 (0.55-0.89) per 0.1 g/dl]. Kidney volume was not associated with patient death after TAE. The main causes of death among patients after renal TAE were similar to those of the general PKD population on dialysis whereas, after hepatic TAE, the main cause was cyst infection with liver failure (12.5% with PLD and 5.9% with PKD, p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Survival after renal TAE with severe PKD was better than for the general PKD population on dialysis, suggesting that renal TAE could overcome the disadvantage due to huge organ size.
29527983	Preoperative Echocardiographic Differences and Transplant Outcomes Among Patients Receiving Simultaneous Liver-Kidney Versus Liver Transplant Alone.	OBJECTIVES: Liver transplant and simultaneous liver-kidney transplant are major surgeries performed on high-risk individuals with end-stage liver disease and end-stage renal disease. We sought to examine the relationship between pretransplant echocardiographic parameters and outcomes in our simultaneous liver-kidney transplant and liver transplant-alone populations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In our retrospective analysis, we included adult patients who underwent index transplant from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2015 at Johns Hopkins Comprehensive Transplant Center. RESULTS: Our study included 312 patients, 266 who underwent liver transplant alone and 46 who underwent simultaneous liver-kidney transplant. Baseline population demographics were similar in both groups of patients. Primary diagnosis at transplant was similar in both groups except that patients undergoing liver transplant were more likely to have a diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma, whereas those undergoing simultaneous liver-kidney transplant were more likely to have polycystic kidney disease. Within the liver transplant-alone group, the strongest demographic predictor of poor outcome was age at transplant. The strongest echocar diographic predictors were related to elevated left ventricular ejection fraction and right ventricular systolic pressure. CONCLUSIONS: In our investigation regarding whether the pretransplant cardiovascular evaluation predicted outcomes for patients undergoing liver transplant alone and patients undergoing simultaneous liver-kidney transplant, we found that elevations in right ventricular systolic pressure and left ventricular ejection fraction may be associated with poor outcomes in the posttransplant period.
26202137	Renal cancer in kidney transplanted patients.	Renal cancer occurs more frequently in renal transplanted patients than in the general population, affecting native kidneys in 90% of cases and the graft in 10 %. In addition to general risk factors, malignancy susceptibility may be influenced by immunosuppressive therapy, the use of calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) as compared with mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors, and the length of dialysis treatment. Acquired cystic kidney disease may increase the risk for renal cancer after transplantation, while autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease does not seem to predispose to cancer development. Annual ultrasound evaluation seems appropriate in patients with congenital or acquired cystic disease or even a single cyst in native kidneys, and every 2 years in patients older than 60 years if they were on dialysis for more than 5 years before transplantation. Immunosuppression should be lowered in patients who develop renal cancer, by reduction or withdrawal of CNI. Although more evidence is still needed, it seems reasonable to shift patients from CNI to everolimus or sirolimus if not already treated with one of these drugs, with due caution in subjects with chronic allograft nephropathy.
29956096	A case of a maintenance hemodialysis patient with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease who underwent living donor liver transplantation alone due to refractory liver cyst infection.	Liver cysts are observed in 83% of cases of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Although not as prevalent as renal cyst infection, liver cyst infection is a serious complication that is sometimes difficult to treat. We report the case of a maintenance hemodialysis patient with ADPKD who received a living donor liver transplantation alone (LDLTA) due to refractory liver cyst infection. The patient was a 67-year-old Japanese man who developed fever and right-side abdominal pain, and liver cyst infection was suspected. Treatment with multiple antibiotics was ineffective. Many liver cysts were observed on magnetic resonance imaging scans and a cyst in liver segment S6, which produced the strongest signal variation, was drained. The fever subsided temporarily, but multiple infected liver cysts were observed on follow-up imaging examination; 4 months later, hepatectomy and LDLTA were performed. Although LDLTA due to refractory liver cyst infection in maintenance hemodialysis patients with ADPKD is risky and should be carefully considered, it may be the only effective treatment.

25568574	Exhausting multiple hemodialysis access failures.	INTRODUCTION: Vascular access is often considered the Achilles heel the of hemodialysis because of its impact on morbidity, all cause mortality and finally costs of these patients. The most common complication of permanent hemodialysis (HD) vascular access is thrombosis, with some cases being related to hypercoagulability states. Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APAS) is a cause of increased thrombotic tendency, and this may complicate the management of such patients on HD. CASE REPORT: We describe a 41-year-old woman with end stage renal disease (ESRD) from Adult Polycystic Kidney Disease who was referred to our tertiary care center for treatment and selection of renal replacement therapy form. It was thought to initiate with peritoneal dialysis considering her actual conditions. She was putted on hemodialysis for several sessions, and a subclavian cathether was her first vascular access. The surgeon created an arterio-venous fistula which did not mature. After the implantation of the peritoneal cathether she started peritoneal dialysis and continued living with that for 2 years. She felt exhausted and because of a grave peritonitis episode accompanied with procedure failure and a long hospitalization she was transferred to hemodialysis. Renal transplantation was not possible because she didn't have a kidney donation. She was maintained on regular HD, but her dialysis care was complicated by recurrent vascular access failures. She had multiple interventions for arterio-venous fistulas and grafts but almost all of them failed due to thrombosis to the extent that only one access site was available for her routine renal replacement treatment. A thorough thrombophilia screen confirmed the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies. A diagnosis of APAS was made and she was anticoagulated with warfarin. The AVG made in this last available site is still working from 18 months. If it fails we have no answers and solutions for her. CONCLUSION: The presence of APAS can complicate HD management by causing recurrent vascular access thrombosis and failure, and nephrologist must remain alert to this possibility. Checking and treating as soon as possible it's our future challenge.
29880342	Effect of Sirolimus on Native Total Kidney Volume After Transplantation in Patients with Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease: A Randomized Controlled Pilot Study.	BACKGROUND: The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway has been shown to be central to cyst formation and growth in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Drugs that suppress mTOR signaling are frequently used as antiproliferative agents for maintenance immunosuppression in patients who have undergone kidney transplantation. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of sirolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, on cyst volume regression in patients with ADPKD who have undergone renal transplantation. METHODS: In this single-center, prospective, open-label, parallel-group, randomized trial, 23 adult patients with ADPKD who successfully underwent renal transplantation from 2008 to 2012 were subsequently randomized (on a 1:1 basis) to a maintenance immunosuppression regimen with either sirolimus (sirolimus, tacrolimus, prednisone) or mycophenolate (mycophenolate, tacrolimus, prednisone). Total kidney volumes were measured by means of high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging within 2 weeks after transplantation and at 1 year. The primary end point was change in total kidney volume at 1 year. RESULTS: Sixteen patients completed the 1-year study (8 patients in each group). There was a decrease in kidney volume in both the sirolimus group (percentage change from baseline, 20.5%; P < .001) and mycophenolate group (percentage change from baseline, 17%; P = .048), but there was no significant difference in percentage change of total kidney volume between the groups (P = .665). CONCLUSIONS: In ADPKD patients at 1 year after kidney transplantation, there was a similar decrease in polycystic kidney volume in patients receiving an immunosuppression regimen containing sirolimus compared with patients receiving mycophenolate.
29306857	Colovesical fistula: a rare complication after renal transplantation.	Colovesical fistula per se is a rare condition and most commonly occurs secondary to diverticular disease in normal patients. Colovesical fistula in the setting of post-renal transplantation is even rarer and very few cases have been reported in literature. Patients with autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) are predisposed to diverticulosis and hence are at a higher risk for fistula formation. Herein, we report a case of colovesical fistula in a renal allograft recipient with ADPKD in the absence of diverticulosis. The patient was successfully operated and is stable with no complications at 1-year follow-up.
37255062	Combined liver-kidney transplant in polycystic diseases: a case report.	Polycystic liver disease, a hereditary pathology, usually manifests as autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. The many cysts in the liver cause massive hepatomegaly, majorly affecting the patient's quality of life. In cases of refractory symptoms, liver transplantation is the only treatment choice. A 43-year-old woman was followed up as a hepatology outpatient in August 2020, with a progressive increase in abdominal volume, lower limb edema, and cachexia. The patient was diagnosed with polycystic renal and liver disease with massive hepatomegaly in March 2021, a combined kidney-liver transplant. Liver size represented 13% of the patient's corporal composition, weighing 8.6kg. The patient was discharged on the 7th postoperative day with no complications. Only 10-20% of patients with polycystic liver disease have clinical manifestations, most of which result from hepatomegaly. An increase in liver volume deteriorates liver function until the condition becomes end-stage liver disease, as kidney function is already compromised; liver-kidney transplantation remains the only treatment choice. The case described drew significant attention to the massive hepatomegaly presented in the patient, with the liver representing over 10% of the patient's body weight, approximately five to six times larger than a normal-sized liver.

35810740	The Need for Routine Native Nephrectomy in the Workup for Kidney Transplantation in Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease Patients.	INTRODUCTION: There is no consensus if nor when a native nephrectomy should be performed in the workup for kidney transplantation in ADPKD patients. In our PKD Expertise Center, a restrictive approach is pursued in which nephrectomy is performed only in patients with severe complaints, i.e., in case of serious volume-related complaints, lack of space for the allograft, recurrent cyst infections, persistent cyst bleedings, or chronic refractory pain. We analyzed in a retrospective cohort study whether this approach is justified. METHODS: All ADPKD patients who received kidney transplantation between January 2000 and January 2019 were reviewed. Patients were subdivided into three groups: no nephrectomy (no-Nx), nephrectomy performed before (pre-Tx), or after kidney transplantation (post-Tx). Simultaneous nephrectomy together with transplantation were not performed in our center. RESULTS: 391 patients (54 +- 9 years, 55% male) were included. The majority of patients did not undergo a nephrectomy (n = 257, 65.7%). A nephrectomy was performed pre-Tx in 114 patients (29.2%). After Tx, nephrectomy was performed in only 30 patients (7.7%, median 4.4 years post-Tx). Surgery-related complication rates did not differ between both groups (38.3% pre-Tx vs. 27.0% post-Tx, p = 0.2), nor were there any differences in 10-year patient survival (74.4% pre-Tx vs. 80.7% post-Tx vs. 67.6% no-Nx, p = 0.4), as well as in 10-year death-censored graft survival (84.4% pre-Tx vs. 85.5% post-Tx vs. 90.0% no-Nx, p = 0.9). CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that with a restrictive nephrectomy policy in the workup for kidney transplantation, only a part of ADPKD patients need a native nephrectomy.
26419536	Causes of end stage renal failure among haemodialysis patients in Khartoum State/Sudan.	BACKGROUND: End stage renal failure (ESRF) has become a major health problem in Sub Saharan Africa (SSA). There were limited data about causes of ESRF in the Sudan. METHODS: This is a cross sectional hospital based descriptive study. The subjects of the study are ESRF adults' patients on regular haemodialysis treatment in 15 haemdoialysis centres in Khartoum State-Sudan. Clinical and epidemiological data were obtained from 1583 patients. The medical files of each patient were reviewed to identify the cause of ESRF. Concerning the causes of ESRF, diabetes was diagnosed based on the past medical history and result of the glucose tolerance test, hypertension was diagnosed based on past history of hypertension based on blood pressure of more than 140/90 mmHg, glomerulonephritis was diagnosed based on results of previous kidney biopsies and on clinical grounds, polycystic kidney disease and obstructive uropathy were diagnosed based on abdominal ultrasound and other imaging modalities, sickle cell anaemia was diagnosed based on the result of haemoglobin electrophoresis, systemic lupus erythematosus was diagnosed based on the clinical criteria in addition to lab results of auto antibodies, and analgesic nephropathy was diagnosed based on past medical history of chronic analgesic drugs usage with no other identifiable risk factors. We included all ESRF patients on regular haemodialysis treatment. We excluded ESRF patients less than 18 years old. RESULTS: The results showed that the mean age of ESRF Patients was 49 +- 15.8 (years) and 63.4% were male and 76.3% were unemployed. The mean duration of haemodialysis is 4.38 +- 4.24 (years). The most common cause of ESRF in our patients was hypertension (34.6%) followed by chronic glomerulonephritis (17.6%), diabetes mellitus (12.8%), obstructive uropathy (9.6 %), autosomal dominant poly cystic kidney disease (ADPKD) (4.7%), chronic pyelonephritis (4.6%), analgesic nephropathy (3.5%). However in (10.7%) no cause was found. In patient aged less than 40 years old the leading cause of ESRF was glomerulonephritis (29.3%) followed by hypertension (25%). In patient aged between 40 to 60 years old the leading cause of ESRF was hypertension (38.5%) followed by diabetes mellitus (14%). In patient aged older than 60 years the leading cause of ESRF was hypertension (38.4%) followed by diabetes mellitus (23.3%). CONCLUSIONS: ESRF in Sudan affects the economically productive age group; unemployment rate among ESRF patients is high. The study showed that hypertension is a leading cause of ESRF in Sudan followed by chronic glomerulonephritis. Hypertension and diabetes mellitus are the leading causes of ESRF among patients over 40 years old.
28676509	Peritoneal Dialysis for Patients with Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease.	End-stage renal disease secondary to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney (ADPKD) is a common issue worldwide. Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is a reasonable option for renal replacement therapy for these patients and should not be withheld due to concerns that the patient may not tolerate the fluid volumes in the peritoneal cavity. This review covers the existing data on the outcomes and complications associated with the use of PD in the polycystic kidney disease patient. In general, PD is well tolerated and outcomes in ADPKD patients are equivalent to or better than other patient groups.
30286208	Can we predict when to start renal replacement therapy in patients with chronic kidney disease using 6 months of clinical data?	PURPOSE: We aimed to develop a model of chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression for predicting the probability and time to progression from various CKD stages to renal replacement therapy (RRT), using 6 months of clinical data variables routinely measured at healthcare centers. METHODS: Data were derived from the electronic medical records of Ajou University Hospital, Suwon, South Korea from October 1997 to September 2012. We included patients who were diagnosed with CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 60 mL min-1 1.73 m-2 for >= 3 months) and followed up for at least 6 months. The study population was randomly divided into training and test sets. RESULTS: We identified 4,509 patients who met reasonable diagnostic criteria. Patients were randomly divided into 2 groups, and after excluding patients with missing data, the training and test sets included 1,625 and 1,618 patients, respectively. The integral mean was the most powerful explanatory (R2 = 0.404) variable among the 8 modified values. Ten variables (age, sex, diabetes mellitus[DM], polycystic kidney disease[PKD], serum albumin, serum hemoglobin, serum phosphorus, serum potassium, eGFR (calculated by Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration [CKD-EPI]), and urinary protein) were included in the final risk prediction model for CKD stage 3 (R2 = 0.330). Ten variables (age, sex, DM, GN, PKD, serum hemoglobin, serum blood urea nitrogen[BUN], serum calcium, eGFR(calculated by Modification of Diet in Renal Disease[MDRD]), and urinary protein) were included in the final risk prediction model for CKD stage 4 (R2 = 0.386). Four variables (serum hemoglobin, serum BUN, eGFR(calculated by MDRD) and urinary protein) were included in the final risk prediction model for CKD stage 5 (R2 = 0.321). CONCLUSION: We created a prediction model according to CKD stages by using integral means. Based on the results of the Brier score (BS) and Harrel's C statistics, we consider that our model has significant explanatory power to predict the probability and interval time to the initiation of RRT.
30286463	Is Peritoneal Dialysis a Suitable Renal Replacement Therapy Option for Polycystic Kidney Disease Patients?	BACKGROUND/AIMS: Mounting clinical experience and evidence from scale observational studies have suggested that polycystic kidney disease (PKD) was not a contraindication for peritoneal dialysis (PD). Recent studies have reported that PD may be associated with a better prognosis in PKD than that of non-PKD patients. To solve the problem, we performed a systematic review and comprehensive meta-analysis to compare the outcomes between PKD and non-PKD patients on PD and the all-cause mortality between patients with PKD on PD and hemodialysis (HD). METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature using electronic databases (PubMed, Ovid, Embase and Web of Science) to identify the studies reporting the endpoint events of PKD/non-PKD patients with PD and the all-cause mortality between patients with PKD on PD and HD, such as dialysis adequacy, technique failure, PD-related complications, the mode of RRT change, and all-cause mortality. We searched the literature published February 2018 or earlier. We used both fix-effects and random-effects models to calculate the overall effect estimate. A sensitivity analysis and subgroup analysis were performed to find the origin of heterogeneity. RESULTS: 12 studies with a total of 17,040 patients reported the endpoint events of PKD/non-PKD patients with PD. No significant difference was observed on dialysis adequacy (Kt/V, SMD: -0.02, 95%CI: -0.12-0.08; D: Pcr (4h), SMD: -0.10, 95% CI: -0.26-0.06), technique failure (RR: 0.97, 95%CI: 0.78-1.20), RRT change (RR: 0.96, 95%CI: 0.77-1.19), total PD-associated complications (RR: 1.0, 95%CI: 0.91-1.09) and all-cause mortality (RR: 0.40, 95%CI: 0.33-0.47) in PKD patients, compared with non-PKD subjects undergoing PD. However, the proportion of renal transplantation in PKD patients was higher than that of non-PKD patients (RR: 2.04, 95%CI: 1.88-2.20) with significant heterogeneity (I2 =82.7%, P=0.000). 4 studies with a total of 5,762 patients reported that the all-cause mortality did not differ between the PKD patients on PD and HD (RR: 0.87, 95%CI: 0.72-1.06). CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis found that the outcomes of given population of PKD patients on PD were at least not inferior as compared to those with other primary kidney diseases, and suggested that PKD might be not absolutely a contraindication for PD. Given the limitations of the proposed, it needs further large-scale studies to assess whether PD is a suitable RRT option for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients with PKD.
27766568	ADPKD: clinical issues before and after renal transplantation.	Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the first genetic cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and the number of these patients who are listed for or receive a kidney transplant (KTx) is continuously increasing over time. Hence, nephrologists are involved not only in the handling of ADPKD patients during the long course of the disease, but also in programming and performing a renal transplant. The handling of all these processes implies the complete awareness of a number of critical points related to the decisions to be taken both before and after the transplant intervention. In the present review, we will briefly deal with the main critical points related to the clinical handling of the patients both before and after KTx.
25825485	Sleep-Disordered Breathing in Patients with Polycystic Liver and Kidney Disease Referred for Transcatheter Arterial Embolization.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is prevalent among patients with CKD, but its prevalence among patients with symptomatic autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) and its association with total liver and kidney volume remain unclear. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: This study examined the association between height-adjusted total liver and kidney volume (htTLKV) and SDB in a cross-sectional study of 304 adult patients with symptomatic ADPKD who were hospitalized at Toranomon Hospital for transcatheter arterial embolization and who underwent pulse oximetry between April 2008 and November 2013. SDB was defined as having a 3% oxygen desaturation index of >=15 events per hour of sleep. Logistic regression was performed with sex-specific quartiles of htTLKV as the main predictor, using patient data and comorbidities as covariates. RESULTS: Overall (54.6% women, mean age 56.2+-9.4 years, 83.5% on hemodialysis), 177 of 304 patients (58.2%) had SDB. SDB was strongly associated with htTLKV quartiles, demonstrating that odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for SDB were 1.63 (0.76 to 3.48), 2.35 (1.09 to 5.06), and 4.61 (1.98 to 10.7) for htTLKV quartiles 2-4 (P for trend, P=0.003), respectively. Older age (OR, 1.81 per 10 years; 95% CI, 1.29 to 2.55), male sex (OR, 3.87; 95% CI, 1.96 to 7.66), receiving hemodialysis (OR, 3.46; 95% CI, 1.62 to 12.1), and higher body mass index (>=25 kg/m(2)) (OR, 3.03; 95% CI, 1.08 to 8.52) were also associated with SDB. CONCLUSIONS: In this highly selected population of patients with symptomatic ADPKD referred for transcatheter arterial embolization, SDB was highly prevalent and independently associated with higher htTLKV.
32118333	Living donor liver transplantation for congenital hepatic fibrosis in children.	Congenital hepatic fibrosis (CHF) often accompanies autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD), which stems from a PKHD1 gene mutation. The aim of this study was to clarify the prognosis of children with CHF who received living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) from donors who might be heterozygous carriers of a hepatorenal fibrocystic disease. Fourteen children with CHF who underwent LDLT at our center were enrolled. Eight and two patients had ARPKD and nephronophthisis, respectively. Eight of the donors were the recipients' fathers, and six donors were their mothers. We examined the histological and radiological findings of the donor livers and complications in the recipients following the liver transplantation. Seven of the donor livers presented morphological abnormalities of the bile ducts. Abdominal computed tomography revealed liver cysts in eight donors. One recipient underwent re-LT for graft failure due to rejection. Three patients presented with rejection, and one presented with sepsis. The overall survival rate was 100% and the original graft survival rate was 93%. In conclusion, the prognosis of recipients who received a LDLT from their parents for CHF was excellent. However, the morphology of half the donor livers was abnormal. Careful follow-up is needed to ensure long-term graft survival.
27436620	Simultaneous adult polycystic kidney disease and Alport syndrome.	
25899445	Pulsed oral sirolimus in advanced autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (Vienna RAP Study): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: Autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a hereditary illness that causes renal tubular epithelial cells to form cysts that proliferate and destroy renal tissue. This usually leads to a decline in renal function, and often to terminal kidney failure, with need for renal replacement therapy. There is currently no causative therapy. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor sirolimus (SIR) is an immunosuppressant with strong antiproliferative effects, and is potentially able to stop or reduce cyst growth and preserve renal function in ADPKD. Continuous mTOR exposure results in a loss of its antiproliferative effects on renal tubular cells. With a half-life of roughly 60 hours, pulsed (weekly) administration of SIR may be an effective way to reduce cyst growth and preserve excretory renal function in ADPKD. METHODS/DESIGN: The Vienna RAP Study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, funded by the Anniversary Fund of the Oesterreichische Nationalbank. We will investigate the effects of a weekly dose of 3 mg SIR on kidney function in 34 patients with advanced ADPKD, compared to a placebo equivalent in 34 patients with advanced ADPKD, over 24 months. The primary endpoint is creatinine level (less or equal than 1.5-fold increase in serum creatinine without initiation of dialysis over two years) and dialysis, renal transplantation, or death. The secondary endpoints are safety, change in proteinuria (as indicated by albumin/creatinine- and protein/creatinine ratio, respectively), and creatinine clearance. DISCUSSIONS: The Vienna RAP Study is, to the best of our knowledge, the first study to investigate the effects of a pulsed (weekly) dose of SIR on renal function in ADPKD. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was registered with EudraCT (identifier: 2012-000550-60 (EU)) on 27 November 2013 and with ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: NCT02055079 (USA)) on 3 February 2014.
24518126	Chronic kidney pain in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease: a case report of successful treatment by catheter-based renal denervation.	Chronic pain is a common concern in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). We report what to our knowledge is the first catheter-based renal denervation procedure in a patient with ADPKD resulting in successful management of chronic pain. The patient was a 43-year-old woman whose chronic pain could not be controlled by pain medication or splanchnic nerve blockade. Transluminal radiofrequency renal denervation was performed as an experimental therapeutic option with an excellent result, indicating that this procedure should be considered for chronic pain management in ADPKD. 
24736482	Autosomal dominant policystic kidney disease, more than a renal disease.	Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a systemic disorder mainly involving the kidney. It affects one in 400-1000 live births. Early hypertension and progressive renal failure due to massive enlargement of cysts and fibrosis are hallmarks of the disease. ADPKD accounts for ~5-10% of cases requiring renal replacement therapy. But not only the kidneys are affected in ADPKD: cysts also occur in other organs such as the liver, pancreas, arachnoid membrane and seminal vesicles. Non-cystic manifestations of the diseases are intracranial aneurysms, hernias and valvular abnormalities. Complications in ADPKD usually result from kidney involvement and include cyst bleeding and cyst infection. However, serious extrarenal features such as subarachnoid haemorrhage can also occur. There is no specific treatment for ADPKD currently, but many molecules targeting up- or downregulated molecules in the renal epithelial cells are being tested. A clinical trial using tolvaptan (a vasopressin receptor antagonist) has demonstrated efficacy, while mTOR inhibitors have shown no positive effect in ADPKD. ACEIs and ARBs are the drugs of choice for treating hypertension in ADPKD. Until a specific therapy becomes available, early treatment of hypertension and lifestyle changes are encouraged. 
25923222	Transcatheter Arterial Embolization with Ethanol Injection in Symptomatic Patients with Enlarged Polycystic Kidneys.	PURPOSE: To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) with ethanol in symptomatic patients with enlarged polycystic kidney disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study was institutional review board approved and was planned for patients with symptoms related to enlarged polycystic kidney disease, such as a markedly distended abdomen, gastroesophageal reflux, and abdominal pain. At the time of TAE, all patients were undergoing dialysis therapy for chronic renal failure, and their urinary volume had decreased to less than 500 mL per day. Bilateral renal TAE with absolute ethanol was performed, and changes in kidney volume, clinical symptoms, laboratory data, and complications were evaluated after TAE. The differences in patients' kidney volumes, clinical symptoms, abdominal circumference, and dry weights before and after TAE were analyzed with a mixed effect model. RESULTS: Fifteen patients (seven men and eight women; mean age, 57.7 years +- 5.3 [standard deviation]) were treated. Among the 15 patients, the follow-up period was 24 months in 13 patients, 6 months in one patient, and 3 months in one patient. The mean kidney volume was 3380 mL before renal TAE, and at 3, 12, and 24 months after TAE, it significantly decreased to 60.9%, 39.8%, and 32.1% of the pretherapeutic value, respectively (P < .001). All patients reported improved clinical symptoms within 3 months after TAE (P < .001). Abdominal circumferences were significantly decreased after TAE (P < .001). The dry weights also continued to significantly decreased until 6 months after TAE (P < .001), at which point they began to slightly increase until 24 months after TAE. Abdominal pain, nausea, and inflammatory response developed in all patients after TAE, but these symptoms improved with conservative treatment. Abscess formation was found in one kidney, and drainage catheter placement was performed. No major complications related to TAE occurred in the remaining patients. CONCLUSION: Renal contraction therapy by TAE with ethanol injection appears to be a safe and effective treatment in patients with symptomatic enlarged polycystic kidney disease.
30340563	Case report: de novo ANCA-associated vasculitis after kidney transplantation treated with rituximab and plasma exchange.	BACKGROUND: Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis causes end-stage renal failure in up to a third of cases even with treatment. The disease recurs occasionally after kidney transplantation, but new onset of ANCA-associated vasculitis after transplantation is highly unusual. The use of rituximab or plasmapheresis for de novo disease after transplantation has not previously been reported. CASE PRESENTATION: Routine post-transplant follow-up for a 66-year old asymptomatic woman revealed a rise in creatinine from 1.8 to 2.6 mg/dl and increased proteinuria. She had received a cadaveric kidney transplant 20 months previously for end-stage autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Renal allograft biopsy unexpectedly demonstrated pauci-immune glomerulonephritis with extracapillary proliferation and interstitial inflammation. Concurrent serum tested strongly positive for ANCA specific to proteinase 3 (PR3), but stored pre- and post-transplantation serum samples tested negative. These findings established a diagnosis of de novo ANCA-associated vasculitis in the renal allograft. We started treatment with high-dose corticosteroid and rituximab. Despite this, serum creatinine continued to rise and glomerulonephritis remained active in a repeat biopsy. Escalation of the treatment with seven sessions of plasmapheresis led to a temporary improvement in creatinine. No further features of vasculitis emerged and PR3-ANCA titres declined. However, multiple infections complicated the recovery period and were associated with progressive loss of renal transplant function. Four months after the index presentation, transplant function became insufficient and dialysis was restarted. CONCLUSIONS: De novo ANCA-associated vasculitis after renal transplantation is exceptionally rare. It poses a significant risk to graft survival even in the context of intensified immunosuppression. Management relies on clinical evidence from populations with native renal function, yet post-transplant patients may be at increased risk of treatment-related adverse events. Precautions against these risks are crucial in the delivery of care.
30683605	Different Effects of Iron Indices on Mortality in Patients With Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease After Long-Term Hemodialysis: A Nationwide Population-Based Study.	OBJECTIVE: Iron supplementation and erythropoietin stimulating agents (ESAs) are essential for maintaining hemoglobin levels in hemodialysis patients. However, patients with autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (PKD) have higher endogenous erythropoietin levels, so their recommended iron indices for hemodialysis patients may differ. This study evaluated iron profiles, including ferritin levels and transferrin saturation (TSAT) to identify factors affecting mortality in patients on dialysis, and those associated with mortality in patients with and without PKD. DESIGN: This cohort study from the Taiwan Renal Registry Data System stratified mortality risk by the presence of PKD recorded as the underlying disease. SUBJECTS: We enrolled 1346 hemodialysis patients with PKD and 82,873 hemodialysis patients without PKD. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary outcome was 3-year all-cause mortality. Predictors included time-averaged and baseline serum ferritin levels and TSAT. Multivariate Cox regression analysis adjusting for age, comorbidities, and relevant laboratory parameters was used to estimate the all-cause hazard ratios (HRs) for mortality. RESULTS: The mean ages of patients with and without PKD were 56.2+-13.2 and 61.7+-13.5 years and the median follow-up time was 37 (15-76) months. The adjusted mortality risks for time-averaged ferritin levels >800 ng/mL (HR=1.52; 95% confidence interval: 1.40-1.65) or TSAT levels >50% (HR=1.46; 95% confidence interval: 1.30-1.65) were significantly higher among patients without PKD than those for patients with normal iron indices. However, a U-shaped curve of mortality against ferritin/TSAT levels was not observed in patients with PKD. In the sensitivity test, there was no difference among PKD patients who underwent regular ESA therapy and those who did not. CONCLUSION: Iron indices have different effects on mortality among patients with and without PKD. Iron supplementation, recommended serum ferritin levels, or TSAT should be monitored in hemodialysis patients, especially those without PKD. Clinicians should consider treating anemia in hemodialysis patients individually, especially in PKD.
31695003	[All-trans retinoic acid/arsenic trioxide combination therapy for a patient with acute promyelocytic leukemia on dialysis].	We report a 55-year-old man who began undergoing hemodialysis for polycystic kidney disease 17 years ago. Because pancytopenia and susceptibility to infection were identified, a bone marrow biopsy was performed, resulting in a diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) treatment was initiated, but promyelocytic leukemia/retinoic acid receptor alpha gene fusion without remission was identified by fluorescence in situ hybridization. We administered ATRA/arsenic trioxide (ATO) combination therapy for therapy-resistant APL and confirmed molecular genetic remission. The ATRA/ATO combination therapy was continued, obtaining complete remission 2 years after commencement of treatment. Cystic infections continued during ATRA/ATO combination therapy, similar to infections before APL morbidity, and there were no adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation. ATRA/ATO combination therapy is considered a safe and effective treatment for therapy-resistant APL patients on hemodialysis.
32250187	New insights into targeting hepatic cystogenesis in autosomal dominant polycystic liver and kidney disease.	Introduction: Polycystic liver disease (PLD) is a rare disease defined by the growth of hepatic cysts and occurs either isolated or as an extrarenal manifestation of polycystic kidney disease. While surgery has been the mainstay in treatment of symptomatic PLD, recently discovered regulatory mechanisms affecting hepatic cystogenesis provide potential new therapies to reduce hepatic cyst burden.Areas covered: This review summarizes intracellular pathways and therapeutic targets involved in hepatic cystogenesis. While drugs that target cAMP, mTOR and bile acids were evaluated in clinical trials, investigation in autophagy, Wnt and miRNA signaling pathways are still in the pre-clinical phase. Recent epidemiological data present female hormones as a promising therapeutic target. Additionally, therapeutic advances in renal cystogenesis are reviewed for their potential application in treatment of hepatic cysts.Expert opinion: Further elucidation of the pathophysiology of hepatic cystogenesis is needed to provide additional targets and improve the efficacy of current treatments. The most promising therapeutic target in PLD is the female hormone pathway, given the increased severity in women and the harmful effects of exogenous estrogens. In addition, combining current pharmaceutical and surgical therapies can lead to improved outcomes. Lastly, the rarity of PLD creates the need to share expertise internationally.

28128912	Robotic Assisted Radical Cystoprostatectomy and Intracorporeal Ileal Conduit Urinary Diversion for a Kidney Transplant Recipient.	INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Robotic assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) is an alternative to open radical cystectomy. As experience is gained with the RARC approach the technique is being applied to more complex surgical cases. We describe here our technique for RARC with intracorporeal ileal conduit urinary diversion for a renal transplant recipient. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The patient is a 60-year old man with high-grade muscle invasive bladder cancer. He has a history of renal failure due to polycystic kidney disease and received a deceased donor renal transplant in 2008. His hospital course at time of transplant was complicated by low-level BK virus viremia. Interestingly his trans-urethral bladder tumor resection specimen at time of bladder cancer diagnosis stained positive for SV40. His native kidneys were anuric so bilateral laparoscopic nephrectomy was performed in a staged fashion 2 weeks prior to RARC. Our surgical technique utilizes 6 trocars, of note a 12-mm assistant trocar is placed 1 cm superior to the pubic symphysis, and this trocar is solely used to pass a laparoscopic stapler to facilitate the excision of the ileal segment and the stapled enteric anastomosis. Surgical steps include: identification of native ureters bilaterally (removed en bloc with the bladder specimen); identification of the transplanted ureter at the right bladder dome; posterior bladder and prostate dissection along Denonvilliers' fascia; development of the space of Retzius; ligation and transection of the bladder and prostate vascular bundles; apical prostate dissection and transection of urethra; left pelvic lymphadenectomy; ilium resection for creation of the ileal conduit; stapled enteric anastomosis; ureteroileal anastomosis; maturation of the ileal conduit stoma. RESULTS: The surgery had no intraoperative complications. Operative time was 443 minutes (7.4 hours). Estimated blood loss was 250 cc. Length of hospital stay was 5 days. The patient did not experience any postoperative complications. The patient maintained good renal graft function with no decline in eGFR to date. CONCLUSIONS: As surgeon comfort and experience with robotic assisted surgery grows, robotic surgery can successfully be applied to less frequently performed procedures. Here we successfully performed a robotic assisted radical cystoprostatectomy with intracorporeal ileal conduit urinary diversion for a renal transplant recipient.
25707138	[Impact of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease on the outcomes of intracytoplasmic sperm injection in infertile males].	OBJECTIVE: To summarize the features and treatment of male infertility induced by autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), and compare the outcomes of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) for infertile men with ADPKD and those with congenital bilateral absence of vas deferens (CBAVD). METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 21 cases of ADPKD-induced infertility, 15 treated by ICSI (group A), and another 164 cases of strictly matched CBAVD-induced infertility (group B). We compared the two groups in the couples' age, the number of ICSI oocytes, and the rates of fertilization, transferrable embryos, good embryos, embryos implanted, clinical pregnancy, biochemical pregnancy, early abortion, singleton and twins in the first cycle. RESULTS: After 28 cycles of ICSI, 10 of the 15 ADPKD-induced infertility patients achieved clinical pregnancy, including 7 cases of live birth, 1 case of spontaneous abortion, and 2 cases of pregnancy maintenance. No significant differences were observed between groups A and B in the couples' age, the wives' BMI, or the numbers of ICSI oocytes and embryos transplanted (P >0.05), nor in the rates of ICSI fertilization (72.64% vs 76.17%), transferrable embryos (51.28% vs 63.24%), quality embryos (38.46% vs 49.83%), embryo implantation (17.64% vs 38.50%), abortion (0 vs 9.23%), singleton (50% vs 81.54%) and twins (50% vs 18.46%). However, the rates of clinical pregnancy (13.33% vs 42.68%, P = 0.023 <0.05) and biochemical pregnancy (13.33% vs 39.63%, P = 0.032 <0.05) were significantly lower in group A than in B. CONCLUSION: ICSI is effective in the treatment of male infertility induced by either ADPKD or CBAVD, but the ADPKD cases have a lower success rate than the CBAVD cases in an individual cycle. The affected couples should be informed of the necessity of prenatal genetic diagnosis before embryo implantation and the inevitable vertical transmission of genetic problems to the offspring.
25083616	Barriers to preemptive renal transplantation: a single center questionnaire study.	BACKGROUND: Preemptive transplantation results in excellent patient and graft survival yet most transplant candidates are referred for transplantation after initiation of dialysis. The goal of this study was to determine barriers to preemptive renal transplantation. METHODS: A nonvalidated questionnaire was administered to prospective kidney transplant recipients to determine factors that hindered or favored referral for transplantation before the initiation of dialysis. RESULTS: One hundred ninety-seven subjects referred for a primary renal transplant completed the questionnaire. Ninety-one subjects (46%) had been informed of preemptive transplantation before referral, and 80 (41%) were predialysis at the time of evaluation. The median time from diagnosis of renal disease to referral was 60 months (range, 2-444 months). In bivariate analysis, among other factors, knowledge of preemptive transplantation was highly associated (odds ratio=94.69) with referral before initiation of dialysis. Given the strong association between knowledge of preemptive transplantation and predialysis referral, this variable was not included in the multivariate analysis. Using multivariate logistic regression analysis, white recipient race, referral by a transplant nephrologist, recipient employment, and the diagnosis of polycystic kidney disease were significantly associated with presentation to the pretransplant clinic before initiation of dialysis. CONCLUSION: The principle barrier to renal transplantation referral before dialysis was patient education regarding the option of preemptive transplantation. Factors significantly associated with referral before dialysis were the diagnosis of polycystic kidney disease, white recipient race, referral by a transplant nephrologist, and employed status. Greater effort should be applied to patient education regarding preemptive transplantation early after the diagnosis of end-stage renal disease.
34370889	Post-transplantation erythrocytosis in kidney transplant recipients-A retrospective cohort study.	OBJECTIVES: To characterize risk factors for the development of post-transplant erythrocytosis (PTE), and its long-term effect on mortality, graft failure, and thrombosis. METHODS: Retrospective study including all kidney transplant recipients in Rabin Medical Center (RMC) during the years 2005-2014. The primary outcome was a composite outcome of all-cause mortality or graft failure at the end of follow-up. Secondary outcomes included death censored graft loss, venous thromboembolism, major adverse cardiovascular events, and mortality. A matched control group was also evaluated. Univariate and multivariate time-varying Cox model analyses were conducted for outcome evaluation. RESULTS: A total of 1304 patients were included, 169 of whom were diagnosed with PTE (12.9%). PTE was associated with male gender, higher glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and polycystic kidney disease. PTE was found to be associated with a reduced risk of the primary outcome (HR 0.355, CI 95% 0.151-0.89, P = .027) in a univariate time-varying Cox analysis, but was not associated with the composite outcome in a multivariate analysis. There was no difference in the primary outcome when the PTE group was compared with the matched control. CONCLUSION: PTE was not found to be associated with long-term outcomes of graft failure and poor survival.
32981026	Quetiapine-induced thrombotic microangiopathy in a patient on maintenance dialysis.	Quetiapine has been reported to cause immune-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), although few cases have been reported thus far. A 71-year-old man with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease on maintenance dialysis was hospitalized with a hemorrhagic basal ganglia stroke, and was treated with 25 mg quetiapine for delirium from day 4 of admission. There was no worsening of consciousness, fever, diarrhea, or elevated blood pressure during the hospitalization. Gingival bleeding appeared on day 35, and the platelet count on day 38 was 0.5 x 104/muL (13.2 x 104/muL on day 16). The presence of 1% schistocytes, high LDH level, inability to measure haptoglobin, negative direct Coombs test, and normal prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time indicated TMA. We considered an exclusionary diagnosis of drug-induced TMA, because of normal ADAMTS13 activity, no evidence of complement activation and the absence of Shiga toxin or symptoms of collagen disease or cancer. Quetiapine was the most likely causative factor; however, all drugs, including heparin, were discontinued or changed. Due to persistent microbleeding, platelet transfusions were performed several times. After only quetiapine was discontinued, the platelet count recovered smoothly to 3.1 and 7.2 x 104/muL on days 45 and 72, respectively; LDH and fibrinogen levels normalized on day 47. All medications, except quetiapine, were restarted sequentially after day 47, without subsequent thrombocytopenia. Platelet activation predominantly by a drug-dependent antibody might be the etiology of quetiapine-induced TMA. Plasmapheresis may not be necessary for quetiapine, because of its unproven efficacy in drug-induced TMA.
24580134	Concomitant use of argatroban and warfarin during hemodialysis in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.	OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: The use of argatroban during hemodialysis in a patient receiving warfarin is not established. We present a case of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia in a patient on hemodialytic therapy who successfully received argatroban concomitantly to warfarin during renal replacement therapy. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 46-year-old male patient with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease presented with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) arised during dialytic procedures. Intervention After the acute episode requiring argatroban and warfarin therapy, the patient continued to receive argatroban during the hemodialytic session concomitantly to warfarin. CONCLUSION: The administration of argatroban in the dialytic circuit of a patient on oral anticoagulant therapy can be considered an effective and safe approach.
32700112	Cyst infection in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease: our experience at Toranomon Hospital and future issues.	Cyst infection is a frequent and serious complication of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) that is often difficult to treat and can be fatal. However, much is still unknown about cyst infection. Positron emission tomography (PET) is generally recommended for detecting infected cysts, but it has the disadvantages of limited availability, high cost, and radiation exposure. We have devised magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) diagnostic criteria for cyst infection. Lipid-soluble antibiotics such as fluoroquinolones show good penetration into cysts and are recommended for cyst infection. However, we reported that fluoroquinolone-resistant microorganisms showed a high prevalence in cyst infection. We should, therefore, reconsider the empirical use of fluoroquinolones for ADPKD patients with cyst infection. We have suggested a new antibiotic strategy according to the severity of cyst infection. It may be important to consider the drug half-life in serum in addition to the drug susceptibility when selecting antibiotics Cyst drainage is necessary for some patients with refractory cyst infection; however, cyst drainage can be associated with severe adverse events. We suggest adaptation criteria for cyst drainage in patients with cyst infection in ADPKD. Most causative bacteria of cyst infection are enterobacteria, and hematogenous spread via bacterial translocation in the intestine is considered the main cause of cyst infection. Therefore, intestinal flora may be important for cyst infection. The role of the intestinal flora in cyst infection in ADPKD is unknown and should be explored in future research.

33858690	Sequential Liver-Kidney Transplantation for Recurrent Liver Cysts Infection in a Patient With Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease: A Case Report.	Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most prevalent hereditary kidney disorder. Liver cysts are the most common extrarenal manifestation of the disease and usually remain asymptomatic. Liver cyst infection is rare, and its treatment is challenging. Liver transplantation (LT) is the only curative therapeutic option in symptomatic polycystic liver disease associated with ADPKD. Only a few cases of LT for recurrent liver cyst infection have been published. To our knowledge, we report the first case of sequential liver-kidney transplantation for recurrent liver cysts infection in a patient with ADPKD. A 55-year-old woman with ADPKD who had a kidney transplantation (KT) presented with multiple liver cysts infection 9 months after her KT. These episodes started after biliary tract complications due to an ampullary adenoma necessitating multiple endoscopic interventions. Her general status gradually degraded because antibiotic treatment was not effective, and she underwent LT for recurrent liver cysts infection 1 year and 9 months after her KT. LT in this setting turned out to be challenging but was possible. We think that better biliary tract workup before KT may prompt better care in these patients.
25637642	A painful inheritance-patient perspectives on living with polycystic kidney disease: thematic synthesis of qualitative research.	BACKGROUND: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a life-threatening genetic disorder and has multiple complications including, infection, pain, intracranial aneurysm and kidney failure leading to significantly impaired quality of life and reduced survival. These outcomes are well described, but patient perspectives and experiences of living with ADPKD are under-recognized. METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and CINAHL were searched to August 2014. Studies were analyzed using thematic synthesis. RESULTS: From 21 studies (n = 247), we derived five themes: unvalidated pain (medical trivialization, inadequacy of pain management); persisting uncertainties and ambiguities (lacking diagnostic clarity, disempowerment in self-care, unpredictable daily disruptions, inability to plan ahead, financial discrimination); genetic guilt and resentment (blaming parents, self-blame, constant burden of guilt); precariousness in pursuing parenthood (prognostic uncertainty, owning the decision, needing directive counselling); and defining parental responsibility for genetic testing and disclosure (preserving normality, doubting necessity of genetic testing, respecting the child's autonomy and hope in future technologies, facilitating preparedness). CONCLUSIONS: The erratic onset of pain contributes to the substantial unpredictability of daily living and prevents patients from establishing long-term life goals. Decisions about family planning, genetic testing of children and disclosure involves making profoundly difficult judgments about ethical parental responsibility. Patient engagement in pain management, strategies for self-care, counselling to reduce the burden of 'genetic guilt' and specific family planning decision support tools may be priorities for care to improve patient-centred outcomes in ADPKD.
33846909	The perioperative management of simultaneous bilateral nephrectomy with renal transplantation: a case series.	PURPOSE: Bilateral nephrectomy is performed at times with renal transplantation. Though surgical indications and timing of these two procedures have been described, there are no large case series describing the anesthetic management of these cases. We sought to describe our experience. METHODS: We performed a historical cohort study on 54 consecutive cases of simultaneous bilateral nephrectomy with renal transplantation at a single, tertiary-care medical centre. Descriptive statistics were used. RESULTS: The most common etiology of kidney disease involved was autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease at 52/54 (96%) cases. All patients received grafts from living donors. An arterial line was placed in 44 (81%) and a central venous catheter in 16 (30%) subjects. At least one vasopressor infusion was used in 44 (81%) cases and 37 (69%) patients required admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Of this subset, 30 (81%) were admitted for ongoing vasopressor support and six (16%) for hemodynamic monitoring. All patients were extubated in the operating room upon completion of the procedure. Median [interquartile range (IQR)] ICU length of stay (LOS) was 0.9 [0.7-1.4] days and total hospital LOS was 4.4 [4.3-5.4] days. There were no cases of mortality at 30 days or of postoperative dialysis. CONCLUSIONS: Adult patients undergoing simultaneous bilateral nephrectomy with renal transplantation often developed perioperative hypotension requiring vasopressor infusions and postoperative transfer to the ICU. This is possibly due to a temporary loss of the renin-angiotensin system. Despite this, patients most commonly were transferred to the floor on postoperative day 1 and had successful outcomes with no mortality at 30 days.
30936360	Optimal imaging conditions for the diagnosis of pleuroperitoneal communication.	A 70-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease caused by a polycystic kidney disease developed massive right-sided pleural effusion 10 days after the initiation of peritoneal dialysis (PD). Although pleuroperitoneal communication (PPC) was suspected, computed tomographic peritoneography on usual breath holding did not show leakage. Therefore, we instructed her to strain with maximal breathing, which caused a jet of contrast material to stream from the peritoneal cavity into the right pleural cavity and allowed the identification of the exact site of the diaphragm defect. Following the thoracoscopic closure of the defect, she was discharged without recurrence of hydrothorax on PD. Hydrothorax due to PPC is a rare complication of PD. Notably, numerous previous modalities used to diagnose PPC lack sufficient sensitivity. Thus, an approach to spread the pressure gradient between the peritoneal cavity and the pleural cavity on imaging may improve this insufficient sensitivity.
36809889	Native nephrectomy in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease in the kidney transplant program - single-center retrospective results of 2000-2020.	INTRODUCTION: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a genetic disease that leads to chronic renal failure in about half of patients. It is a multisystemic disease with a predominance of kidney involvement, which significantly worsens the patient's health. Controversial issues include the indication and the timing and technique of nephrectomy of native polycystic kidneys. METHODS: A retrospective observational study focused on the surgical aspects of patients with ADPKD who underwent native nephrectomy at our institution. The group included patients operated on in the period 1/1/2000-31/12/2020. A total of 115 patients with ADPKD were enrolled (14.7% of all transplant recipients). We evaluated the basic demographic data, type of surgery, indications and complications in this group. RESULTS: Native nephrectomy was performed in 68 out of a total of 115 (59%) patients. Unilateral nephrectomy was done in 22 (32%) patients and bilateral in 46 (68%). The most common indications were infections (42 patients, 36%), pain (31 patients, 27%), hematuria (14 patients, 12%), gastrointestinal reasons (1 patient, 1%), respiratory reasons (1 patient, 1%), obtaining a site for transplantation (17 patients, 15%) and suspected tumor (5 patients, 4%). CONCLUSION: Native nephrectomy is recommended in symptomatic kidneys, or in asymptomatic kidneys when it is necessary to obtain a place for kidney transplantation, and in kidneys where a tumor is suspected.
32241780	A Post Hoc Analysis of Statin Use in Tolvaptan Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease Pivotal Trials.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Tolvaptan is approved to slow kidney function decline in adults with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) at risk of rapid progression. Because in vitro studies indicated that the tolvaptan oxobutyric acid metabolite inhibits organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1 and OATP1B3, United States prescribing information advises avoiding concurrent use with OATP1B1/1B3 substrates, including hepatic hydroxymethyl glutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins). This post hoc analysis of the pivotal phase 3 tolvaptan trials (Tolvaptan Efficacy and Safety in Management of Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease and Its Outcomes [TEMPO] 3:4 trial [NCT00428948] and Replicating Evidence of Preserved Renal Function: an Investigation of Tolvaptan Safety and Efficacy in ADPKD [REPRISE] trial [NCT02160145]) examined the safety of concurrent tolvaptan/statin use. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: The trials randomized a combined total of 2815 subjects with early- to late-stage ADPKD to tolvaptan (n=1644) or placebo (n=1171) for 3 years (TEMPO 3:4) and 1 year (REPRISE). Statin use was unrestricted, and 597 subjects (21.2% overall; 332 [20.2%] tolvaptan, 265 [22.6%] placebo) received statins. Statin use (duration, dose change, statin change, permanent discontinuation), incidences of statin-related adverse events, and hepatic transaminase elevations were determined for subjects who received tolvaptan+statin, placebo+statin, tolvaptan alone, and placebo alone. RESULTS: No differences in statin use parameters between tolvaptan- and placebo-treated subjects were observed. No statistically significant increases in commonly reported statin-related adverse events (e.g., musculoskeletal disorders, gastrointestinal symptoms) were seen between subjects receiving tolvaptan+statin and placebo+statin. For example, in TEMPO 3:4, frequencies were 5.4% and 7.8%, respectively, for myalgia (difference -2.4%; 95% confidence interval, -11.2% to 6.4%) and 9.3% and 7.8%, respectively, for abdominal pain (difference 1.5%; -7.9% to 10.9%). In an analysis that excluded participants concurrently using allopurinol, the frequency of alanine transaminase or aspartate transaminase >3x upper limit of normal in the pooled study populations was 3.6% for the tolvaptan+statin group and 2.3% for the placebo+statin group (difference 1.4%; -2.0% to 4.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Tolvaptan has been used safely in combination with statins in clinical trials.

25292408	Peritoneal Dialysis Can Be an Option for Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease: an Observational Study.	BACKGROUND: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) has been considered a relative contraindication for peritoneal dialysis (PD), although there are few specific studies available. METHODS: A multicenter historical prospective matched-cohort study was conducted to describe the outcome of ADPKD patients who have chosen PD. All ADPKD patients starting PD (n = 106) between January 2003 and December 2010 and a control group (2 consecutive patients without ADPKD) were studied. Mortality, PD-technique failure, peritonitis, abdominal wall leaks and cyst infections were compared. RESULTS: Patients with ADPKD had similar age but less comorbidity at PD inclusion: Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) 4.3 (standard deviation [SD] 1.6) vs 5.3 (SD 2.5) p < 0.001, diabetes mellitus 5.7% vs 29.2%, p < 0.001 and previous cardiovascular events 10.4% vs 27.8%, p < 0.001. No differences were observed in clinical events that required transient transfer to hemodialysis, nor in peritoneal leakage episodes or delivered dialysis dose. The cyst infection rate was low (0.09 episodes per patient-year) and cyst infections were not associated to peritonitis episodes. Overall technique survival was similar in both groups. Permanent transfer to hemodialysis because of surgery or peritoneal leakage was more frequent in ADPKD. More ADPKD patients were included in the transplant waiting list (69.8 vs 58%, p = 0.04) but mean time to transplantation was similar (2.08 [1.69 - 2.47] years). The mortality rate was lower (2.5 vs 7.6 deaths/100 patient-year, p = 0.02) and the median patient survival was longer in ADPKD patients (6.04 [5.39 - 6.69] vs 5.57 [4.95 - 6.18] years, p = 0.024). CONCLUSION: Peritoneal dialysis is a suitable renal replacement therapy option for ADPKD patients.
36881881	Effect of Kidney transplantation on cyst growth in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.	BACKGROUND: In patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), there is limited evidence of the rate of cyst progression after kidney transplantation. AIMS: To compare the height-adjusted total kidney volume (Ht-TKV) before and after transplantation in kidney transplant recipients (KTR) with -ADPKD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective cohort study. The estimate of Ht-TKV was calculated by the ellipsoid volume equation using measurements from CT or yearly MRI scans before and after transplantation. RESULTS: We included 30 patients with -ADPKD who underwent kidney transplantation (age 49 +- 10.1 years, 11 (37%) females, dialysis vintage 3 (1 - 6) years, and 4 (13%) underwent unilateral nephrectomy during the peritransplant period). The median follow-up time was 5 years (range 2 - 16 years). Transplantation was associated with a significant decrease in Ht-TKV after transplantation in 27 (90%) KTR. Median Ht-TKV decreased from 1,708 (IQR 1,100 - 2,350) mL/m to 710 (IQR 420 - 1,380) mL/m after 6 years of follow-up (p < 0.001), with a mean Ht-TKV change rate per year after transplantation of -1.4, -11.8, -9.7, -12.7, -7.0, and -9.4% after 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 years, respectively. Even in 2 (7%) KTR without regression, the annual growth was < 1.5% per year after transplantation. CONCLUSION: Kidney transplantation reduced Ht-TKV after the first 2 years of transplantation, and this decline was continuous for more than 6 years of follow-up.
26341656	Combined liver and kidney transplantation and kidney after liver transplantation in children: Indication, postoperative outcome, and long-term results.	CLKT and sequential KALT are decided on a case-by-case basis in children for special indications such as ARPKD or PH1. We report on 21 children who underwent CLKT or KALT at our hospital between 1998 and 2013. Eleven children were diagnosed with PH1 and six with ARPKD. Other diagnosis were Joubert syndrome (n = 1), nephronophthisis (n = 1), CF (n = 1), and hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 1). Children (12 males, nine females) were aged 7.8 +- 6.2 yr (range, 10 months to 18 yr) at time of transplantation. Average wait time was 1.9 +- 0.9 yr (range, four months to 2.3 yr). Fifteen patients received dialysis prior to transplantation. In PH1 patients, four children received CLKT, five received KALT, and two infants have received only an LTx, whereas all six patients with ARPKD received CLKT. In patients with other indications, CLKT was performed in three cases and KALT in one girl. Cumulative 10-yr survival of all 21 patients was 78.4%. At the time of transfer into adult care, 13 patients retained stable liver and kidney function. Regardless the underlying diagnosis, CLKT and KALT can be performed in children with good surgical outcomes and long-term survival.
28090763	Sodium and fluid management in the conservative management of chronic kidney disease.	Chronic kidney disease (CKD) imposes a significant global health burden. In the United States, one in three adults are at risk for CKD currently affecting over 28 million Americans. While several studies have demonstrated the benefit of treating traditional risk factors in CKD, including hypertension with pharmacologic agents such as blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAAS), there is scarce data on the advantages of sodium and fluid management in this population. Both experimental and observational studies have shown improvement in hypertension and cardiovascular outcomes with sodium restriction to <=2.3 grams per day, however, to date there are very few randomized controlled trials demonstrating a benefit in sodium reduction for the prevention or progression of CKD. Similarly, studies on increasing fluid consumption have shown to be advantageous in polycystic kidney disease as well as chronic nephrolithiasis, yet no randomized controlled trials exist on the fluid management in patients with kidney disease. This review aims to explore the evidence of sodium restriction and fluid management in the CKD population as well as underlying mechanisms and clinical barriers of sodium and water management as conservative therapy.
25306468	Liver disease in kidney transplant recipients.	Kidney transplant recipients can develop acute and chronic liver disease from a variety of conditions. Chronic viral hepatitis from hepatitis C is seen in increased frequency in hemodialysis patients. Genetic conditions, such as polycystic kidney disease, which lead to the need for kidney transplantation are also associated with liver diseases including congenital hepatic fibrosis and polycystic liver disease. Other conditions that can induce liver disease in this immune-suppressed population include a multitude of viral infections, as well as other systemic infections that can involve the liver. Drug induced liver injury is also seen in increased rates due to the use of poly-pharmacy, the effect of immune-suppression on drug metabolizing pathways in the liver and the potential of drug to drug interactions. Post transplant metabolic syndrome is also increased in kidney transplant recipients and this can lead to development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. A knowledge of the presentation of these liver diseases is essential in diagnosing the cause of liver disease as well as informing the diagnostic workup. Specific therapies for the various conditions will also be discussed in this review. 
34465423	Early-Isolated V Lesion in Kidney Allograft: Acute Rejection or Ischemic Injury? A Case Report of Primary Nonfunction and Graft Loss.	Intimal arteritis (v-lesion) is a negative prognostic factor for kidney allograft survival. Early isolated v-lesions do not always represent a pathologic marker of acute T cell- or antibody-mediated rejection. In particular, in the case of transplant negative for C4d and donor-specific antibodies, such a finding can suggest an ischemic-reperfusion injury. There is an intense debate in the literature concerning the origin of this histologic feature. In the present study, we analyze how this argument can have a clinical relevance. Here we report a case of a 61-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease due to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. The patient underwent kidney transplant from expanded criteria donor. Organs from expanded criteria donors are more prone to ischemic-reperfusion injury. Postoperative course was characterized by primary nonfunction of the graft. A first biopsy showed early isolated v-lesion in otherwise normal renal parenchymal. Simultaneously, a computed tomography scan revealed stenosis of the main renal artery. An endovascular stent was placed. Despite improved vascularization of the graft, no clinical response was observed and the patient remained anuric. A second biopsy was performed, showing T-cell mediated rejection (Banff Classification 1A). Despite pulse steroid, the patient lost the graft.
31792758	Kidney transplant patient with immunoglobulin A nephropathy subsequently diagnosed as concurrent autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease during 17-year follow-up.	A 14-year-old Japanese boy was diagnosed with immunoglobulin A nephropathy resulting in end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). He underwent ABO-compatible living kidney transplantation from his father at the age of 27. In the process of selecting a donor before the transplantation, it turned out that his mother had polycystic kidneys and that her family had a history of hypertension and cerebrovascular diseases. The patient himself also had bilateral multiple kidney cysts, with a normal-sized kidney, confusing us to make the diagnosis of acquired cystic kidney disease (ACKD) or ADPKD difficult at that point. Seventeen years later, his native kidneys showed bilateral swelling with multiple cysts. This, along with the histories of his mother and her relatives and with the existence of multiple liver cysts, led us to confirm the diagnosis of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, not of ACKD. Contrary to previous studies that have suggested the size of cysts both in ADPKD and ACKD reduced with time, the present case showed an increase of 3.0% per year in total kidney volume (TKV) by computed tomography. It suggested the possibility that TKV, after decreasing in the relatively early stage after transplantation, may later increase in the long term after ESKD due to another kidney injury.
32985321	Different risk factors are associated with vascular access patency after construction and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty in patients starting hemodialysis.	BACKGROUND: The objective of this multicenter, prospective observational study was to determine the factors related to patency rates after construction of vascular access (VA) and the first percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA). METHODS: The 24-month primary and secondary patency rates after construction of a radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula (RC-AVF) and arteriovenous graft (AVG) were evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. The 12-month post-PTA patency rate was also investigated. A Cox proportional hazard model was used to identify clinical parameters associated with the primary patency rate and the post-PTA patency rate. RESULTS: A total of 611 patients were enrolled in the study. The primary patency rate after VA construction was lower in hemodialysis (HD) patients with an AVG than in those with an AVF. Aging (hazard ratio [HR], 1.02 per 1 year; p < 0.001), female sex (HR, 1.41; p = 0.03), diabetes mellitus (HR, 1.37; p = 0.03), low serum albumin (HR, 0.76 per 1-g/dL decrease; p = 0.02), and use of an erythropoietin-stimulating agent (HR, 1.62; p = 0.02) were risk factors for VA problems. The post-PTA patency rate was associated with aging (HR, 1.02; p < 0.001), diabetes mellitus (HR, 1.49; p = 0.02), polycystic kidney disease (HR, 2.14; p = 0.01), temporary catheter use for initiation of HD (HR, 1.60; p = 0.02), and period from VA construction to use (HR, 0.99; p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Although a poor patency rate is commonly associated with advanced age and diabetes, different risk factors affect patency between VA construction and the first PTA.
33111320	A novel monogenic preimplantation genetic testing strategy for sporadic polycystic kidney caused by de novo PKD1 mutation.	Autosomal dominant hereditary polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common inherited kidney disease that causes end-stage renal disease and kidney failure. Preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic (PGT-M) can effectively prevent the transmission of genetic diseases from parents to the offspring before pregnancy. However, PGT-M currently adopts the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) linkage analysis for embryo's pathogenic gene carrying status and linkage analysis requires proband of the family. Here we report a new PGT-M strategy using single sperm SNP linkage analysis for male patient with sporadic ADPKD caused by de novo PKD1 mutation. We recruited five couples with male patient with ADPKD caused by de novo PKD1 mutation, and 39 embryos from six PGT-M cycles were detected. The five couples had at least one embryo that does not carry the PKD1 mutation. Within these five couples, the accuracy of carrier status of embryos was confirmed by amniotic fluid gene detection of two couples and two couples successfully delivered healthy fetuses. Therefore, the new PGT-M strategy of using single sperm SNP linkage analysis was proved to be feasible and effective for male patient with ADPKD caused by de novo PKD1 mutation.
28873973	Effect of renal transcatheter arterial embolization on quality of life in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.	BACKGROUND: Currently, there are few strategies for improving the quality of life (QOL) in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) and massive kidneys. Renal transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) reduces kidney volume, but its impact on QOL in ADPKD patients on hemodialysis is unknown. This study investigated the influence of renal TAE on QOL in ADPKD patients with massive kidneys receiving hemodialysis. METHODS: This prospective observational study enrolled 188 ADPKD patients on hemodialysis (92 men and 96 women; mean age 56.7 +- 9.1 years) who underwent renal TAE at Toranomon Hospital between August 2010 and July 2014. The 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and our original 15-item questionnaire were used to evaluate QOL. RESULTS: Using a linear mixed model, the least squares mean values of the SF-36 physical component summary (PCS), mental component summary (MCS) and role/social component summary (RCS) before renal TAE were calculated as 38.21 [95% confidence interval (CI) 36.50-39.91], 48.45 (47.05-49.86) and 43.04 (40.70-45.37), respectively. These values improved to 42.0 (40.22-43.77; P < 0.001 versus before TAE), 51.25 (49.78-52.71; P = 0.001) and 49.67 (47.22-52.12; P < 0.001), respectively, 1 year after renal TAE. Scores for abdominal fullness, poor appetite and heartburn showed marked improvement after renal TAE, while scores for fever, bodily pain and sleep disorder also improved slightly, but significantly. Scores for constipation and use of analgesics/sleeping medications/laxatives did not improve significantly. All of the SF-36 scores and the scores for specific symptoms (except bodily pain, snoring and constipation) were significantly correlated with the sequential decrease of the height-adjusted total kidney volume. CONCLUSIONS: In ADPKD patients on hemodialysis, renal TAE was effective in improving abdominal fullness, appetite, heartburn and SF-36 scores (MCS and RCS scores), but not for sleep disturbance, constipation and physical strength (PCS score).
33439995	Renal transplant outcomes in amyloidosis.	BACKGROUND: Outcomes after renal transplantation have traditionally been poor in systemic amyloid A (AA) amyloidosis and systemic light chain (AL) amyloidosis, with high mortality and frequent recurrent disease. We sought to compare outcomes with matched transplant recipients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) and diabetic nephropathy (DN), and identify factors predictive of outcomes. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 51 systemic AL and 48 systemic AA amyloidosis patients undergoing renal transplantation. Matched groups were generated by propensity score matching. Patient and death-censored allograft survival were compared via Kaplan-Meier survival analyses, and assessment of clinicopathological features predicting outcomes via Cox proportional hazard analyses. RESULTS: One-, 5- and 10-year death-censored unadjusted graft survival was, respectively, 94, 91 and 78% for AA amyloidosis, and 98, 93 and 93% for AL amyloidosis; median patient survival was 13.1 and 7.9 years, respectively. Patient survival in AL and AA amyloidosis was comparable to DN, but poorer than ADPKD [hazard ratio (HR) = 3.12 and 3.09, respectively; P < 0.001]. Death-censored allograft survival was comparable between all groups. In AL amyloidosis, mortality was predicted by interventricular septum at end diastole (IVSd) thickness >12 mm (HR = 26.58; P = 0.03), while survival was predicted by haematologic response (very good partial or complete response; HR = 0.07; P = 0.018). In AA amyloidosis, recurrent amyloid was associated with elevated serum amyloid A concentration but not with outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Renal transplantation outcomes for selected patients with AA and AL amyloidosis are comparable to those with DN. In AL amyloidosis, IVSd thickness and achievement of deep haematologic response pre-transplant profoundly impact patient survival.
38864143	[Acquired cystic kidney hemorrhage in peritoneal dialysis patients: A report of three cases].	Spontaneous renal cyst hemorrhage is one of the clinical emergencies in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients and is potentially life-threatening. The main complaints are sudden low back pain, paleness, and hypotensive shock with or without vomiting or fever. In contrast to inherited polycystic kidney disease, acquired cystic kidney disease (ACKD) secondary to chronic kidney disease is easily overlooked or delayed in clinical diagnosis and treatment, leading to severe clinical outcomes. We report three patients with spontaneous hemorrhage of ACKD in the peritoneal dialysis center at Peking University First Hospital. The common features are as follows, long history of dialysis, mild to severe low back pain, decrease in hemoglobulin, negative PD solutions, diagnosis established through computed tomography (CT), and continuing PD during treatment of ACKD hemorrhage. Treatments vary from conservative to unilaterally selective renal artery embolization. In this study, ACKD morbidity was investigated in PD patients. A total of 316 patients who had an abdominal ultrasound, CT, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the past 1 year were enrolled. Among them, 103 cases (32.9%) met the diagnostic criteria of ACKD. The morbidity rates were 27.5%, 37.8%, 43.8%, 59.1%, and 88.6%, when the dialysis history ranged from <=3, >3 & <=5, >5 & <=7, >7 & <=9, >9 years, respectively, showing a increasing trend. Most ACKD hemorrhages could be healed and got an acceptable prognosis after treatment, including rest, blood transfusion, selective renal artery embolization, or nephrectomy. We summarize the risk factors, including a long history of dialysis, anticoagulation or antiplatelet, and inflammation or stones of the urinary system, but with no difference in initial kidney diseases and gender. ACKD hemorrhage mainly includes intracapsular hemorrhage, cyst rupture, and spontaneous retroperitoneal hemorrhage. In addition, we also recommend an adaptive process for spontaneous kidney hemorrhage of diagnosis and treatment in peritoneal dialysis patients. The significance of these cases lies in the fact that patients with ACKD are potentially associated with complications such as cyst hemorrhage and malignancy. Thus, peritoneal dialysis physicians should place great importance on the surveillance of ACKD.
31924636	Long-acting somatostatin analogue treatments in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and polycystic liver disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.	OBJECTIVES: A number of randomised control trials (RCTs) investigating the effects of long-acting somatostatin analogues in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) and polycystic liver disease (PLD) have been recently reported. We sought to evaluate all available RCTs investigating the efficacy of somatostatin analogues treatment in ADPKD and PLD. DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases; Pubmed, Clincaltrials.gov and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: RCTs and randomised cross-over trials comparing the effects of somatostatin analogue treatment with controls in patients with ADPKD or PLD. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Data extraction and bias assessments were performed by two independent reviewers between January and May 2019. Outcomes assessed included estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), total kidney volume (TKV), total liver volume (TLV), progression to end stage renal failure (ESRF) and adverse effects. Data were pooled using a random-effects model and reported as relative risk or mean difference with 95% CIs. RESULTS: Meta-analysis was performed of six RCTs or randomised cross-over trials and three secondary analyses. A total of 592 patients were included. Compared with controls, somatostatin analogue treatment significantly reduced TLV (mean difference -0.15 L, 95% CI -0.26 to -0.03, p=0.01). There was no significant effect on TKV (mean difference -0.19 L, 95% CI -0.50 to 0.12, p=0.23) or eGFR (mean difference 0.27 mL/min/1.73 m2, 95% CI -2.03 to 2.57, p=0.82). There was no effect on progression to ESRF. Somatostatin analogues were associated with known adverse effects such as gastrointestinal symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The available RCT data show improvement in TLV with somatostatin analogue treatment. There was no benefit to TKV or eGFR in patients with ADPKD, while being associated with various side effects. Further studies are needed to assess potential benefit in reducing cyst burden in patients with PLD.
34204582	Molecular Pathophysiology of Autosomal Recessive Polycystic Kidney Disease.	Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) is a rare disorder and one of the most severe forms of polycystic kidney disease, leading to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in childhood. PKHD1 is the gene that is responsible for the vast majority of ARPKD. However, some cases have been related to a new gene that was recently identified (DZIP1L gene), as well as several ciliary genes that can mimic a ARPKD-like phenotypic spectrum. In addition, a number of molecular pathways involved in the ARPKD pathogenesis and progression were elucidated using cellular and animal models. However, the function of the ARPKD proteins and the molecular mechanism of the disease currently remain incompletely understood. Here, we review the clinics, treatment, genetics, and molecular basis of ARPKD, highlighting the most recent findings in the field.
31464248	Attitudes and perceived barriers toward arteriovenous fistula creation and use in hemodialysis patients in Jordan.	Current guidelines recommend arteriovenous fistula (AVF) as the preferred method of access for hemodialysis (HD) patients; however, its utilization remains low. The attitudes of Jordanian HD patients and perceived barriers toward AVF are unknown and have not been well studied. In-center HD patients in the Jordan Ministry of Health largest dialysis unit were interviewed, and a questionnaire was administered inquiring about their experiences, attitudes, and perceived barriers toward AVF. Of 104 total patients, 93 met the inclusion criteria. Mean age was 50 +- 16 years, with 44% being female. Average body mass index was 25 +- 5. The cause of end-stage renal disease was diabetes mellitus in 28 (30%), hypertension in 28 (30%), and polycystic kidney disease in three (3%). Patients had an average time on dialysis of 72 months (range 1-240). Current method of HD access was AVF in 45 (48%) and central venous catheter in 30 (32%). The most reported perceived cause of no AVF was delayed referral to surgical evaluation in 19 (40%), refusal to undergo AVF surgical procedure in 16 (33%), and poor understanding of disease in 13 (27%). Of the total studied group, only 29 (31%) indicated that they received sufficient education/information about AVF prior to creation of HD access. Seventy-eight patients (84%) reported that they would recommend AVF as method of access for other HD patients. The reason why majority of patients preferred AVF was reported as: easier to care for 51 (65%), better associated hygiene 26 (33%), and perceived less infection risk 24 (31%). In conclusion, in this sample population from HD patients in Jordan, majority would recommend an AVF as mode of access. Perceived barriers include lack of timely referral for vascular surgical evaluation and poor understanding of disease. A systematic assessment of the process that precedes the creation of AVF, with focus on areas of reported barriers may allow for better utilization of AVF.
30497224	Ruptured intracranial aneurysm in a patient with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease.	Aneurysmal rupture can result in devastating neurological consequences and can be complicated by comorbid disease processes. Patients with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) have a low rate of reported aneurysms, but this may be due to the relative high rate of end-stage illnesses early in childhood. Authors here report the case of a 10-year-old boy with ARPKD who presented with a Hunt and Hess grade V subarachnoid hemorrhage requiring emergency ventriculostomy, embolization, and decompressive craniectomy. Despite initial improvements in his neurological status, the patient succumbed to hepatic failure. Given the catastrophic outcomes of subarachnoid hemorrhage in young patients, early radiographic screening in those with ARPKD may be warranted.
30509370	Left ventricular dysfunction in ADPKD and effects of octreotide-LAR: A cross-sectional and longitudinal substudy of the ALADIN trial.	BACKGROUND AND AIM: In autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) cardiac abnormalities have been observed before the onset of hypertension or renal dysfunction. We sought to characterize, in ADPKD patients, left ventricular (LV) function and its changes after somatostatin-analogue octreotide-LAR treatment. METHODS: In a 1:1:1 cross-sectional study, we evaluated LV function by speckle-tracking echocardiography in 34 ADPKD patients from one ALADIN-trial center and in 34 age- and gender-matched healthy controls and 34 equally-matched renal controls with non-cystic chronic kidney disease. Changes in LV function were compared in the 16 and 18 ADPKD patients originally randomized to 3 year-treatment with octreotide-LAR or placebo, respectively. RESULTS: LV twist and untwisting rates were lower in ADPKD patients that in healthy or renal controls (6.1 +- 2.6  vs. 11.1 +- 2.1  and 10.2 +- 3.7 ; -49.5 +- 18.1 /s vs. -79.8 +- 12.2 /s and -84.3 +- 25.9 /s, respectively, all p < 0.001). The correlation between LV mass or diastolic BP and untwisting rate was positive in ADPKD patients (r = 0.38, p = 0.025 and r = 0.44, p = 0.011, respectively), not significant in healthy controls and negative in renal controls (r = -0.38; p = 0.023 and r = -0.40, p = 0.012, respectively. LV untwisting rate improved from -49.9 +- 18.6 /s to -70.3 +- 27.5 /s with octreotide-LAR, but did not change with placebo (p = 0.027 for treatment effect). At adjusted linear regression analysis, octreotide-LAR therapy emerged as the only independent predictor of untwisting rate improvement at final visit [beta coefficient -0.504 (95% CI -46.905--6.367), p = 0.014]. CONCLUSIONS: In ADPKD patients LV function is early impaired. Somatostatin-analogue therapy might help in preventing or ameliorating LV dysfunction in this population.

31711576	Native Nephrectomy in Patients With Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease Evaluated for Kidney Transplantation.	Native nephrectomy (NN) in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is indicated in cases of recurrent urinary tract infections and hematuria, neoplastic degeneration, and encumbrance. Timing, indication, and surgical approach of NN depends on the symptoms or policy of the center. The aim of our study is to evaluate our experience. In our retrospective study, we included 130 patients with a diagnosis of ADPKD from 530 patients evaluated for renal transplantation from 2011 to 2017. We analyzed the etiologic indication, the timing, and the complications of NN. In our cohort, 53 patients underwent open NN, 85% pre-kidney transplantation (KT), 13% post-KT, and only 1 case simultaneous with KT. In the pre-KT group, indications included: major indication was encumbrance in the. In the post-KT group, the major indication was infection followed by encumbrance, which developed after KT. Complications were: 3 cases of bleeding (1 required relaparotomy, 2 evolved into hematoma and radiological derange); 1 iatrogenic iliac artery injury, which was contextually repaired, and 5 cases of incisional hernia. At 35 +- 7.2 months follow-up, patients' survival was 96%; 1 patient died at the induction of anesthesia and 1 patient from sepsis after double NN and removal of nonfunctional transplanted kidney. NN is not without complications and should be performed when clearly indicated. In our experience, we preferred to perform NN before KT.
29425828	Outcomes of renal transplant from donors with polycystic kidney disease.	INTRODUCTION: Kidneys from donors affected by autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) are, in general, considered unsuitable for transplantation. However, some authors report cases of patients who received kidneys from a deceased ADPKD donor showing encouraging outcomes. Our aim is to provide our experience of a patient with end stage renal failure who received a deceased donor kidney from a 29-year-old who themselves had been diagnosed with ADPKD but well maintained renal function, and to provide a comprehensive review of all the published literature. METHODS: In addition to our case, a literature search (PubMed database, Embase, Cochrane Library) of articles published between 1980 and 2017 was performed. RESULTS: Sixteen cases were identified. Median donor age was 24 (range12-55) years old. Median recipient age was 46 (range 19-72) years old. Fifteen cases had a single kidney transplant and one case had a dual kidney transplant. 13/16 (81%) had immediate function, 2 patients (12.5%) had delayed graft function and one patient (6.25%) had primary non-function. Median graft follow up was 36 months (range 6-180). Median serum creatinine at last follow up was 124 mumol/L (range75-442). Thirteen patients (81%) were still alive with a working renal transplant at last follow up. CONCLUSION: The published literature is encouraging and supports the use of polycystic kidneys from younger deceased donors. Therefore, we believe that if kidneys from ADPKD donors are offered, they should have a full assessment and be considered acceptable for renal donation to recipients who may have a life expectancy of 10 years or less and who are fully informed and have the capacity to consent to receiving a polycystic kidney.
27460786	Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation with contrast-enhanced ultrasonography for solitary and sporadic renal cell carcinoma in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.	BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to assess the functional and oncologic outcomes of percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) with contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) for renal cell carcinoma in patient with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of five patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) from January 2009 to December 2014 with a media follow-up of 33 months. The tumors were ablated with Cool-tip RFA system under the guidance of CEUS. Routine follow-up included contrast-enhanced computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (CT/MRI) and renal function tests. RESULTS: Media diameter of the treated renal tumors was 3.1 cm (range 1.7-5.2 cm). Initial ablation success rate was 4/5. After over 6 months contrast-enhanced CT/MRI follow-up after RFA, no patients experienced local tumor recurrence. No patients required dialysis in the periprocedural period. Minor complications only developed in two cases. There was no significant difference in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) between pre- and post-RFA. CONCLUSIONS: Our initial experience of this technique for RCC in ADPKD was favorable with good renal function preservation and oncologic outcomes. It may be a good choice for RCC in ADPKD.
36094388	Native nephrectomy and arterial embolization of native kidney in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease patients: indications, timing and postoperative outcomes.	INTRODUCTION: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is one of the most common causes of a need of renal replacement therapy. The need (elective vs. systematic) and timing of native kidney nephrectomy (before, after or during kidney transplantation) is a matter of debate and alternatives to surgery, mainly transcatheter arterial embolization have been explored. We performed a systematic review to report all available evidence on postintervention outcomes of native nephrectomy and arterial embolization in ADPKD patients. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A search on Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases was performed to identify all studies reporting outcomes of native nephrectomy or arterial embolization in APKDs. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Concerning native nephrectomy, a total of 3626 patients in 37 studies were included with 735, 210 and 2681 patients who underwent native nephrectomy respectively before, after or during kidney transplantation. Major complications were 12.2% in unilateral nephrectomy before transplantation, 25.0% in bilateral nephrectomy before transplantation, 17.7% in unilateral nephrectomy during transplantation, 20.8% in bilateral nephrectomy during transplantation and 23.8% in unilateral and bilateral nephrectomy after transplantation. A total of 230 patients in 7 series of arterial embolization were included. All arterial embolization were performed before transplantation. Mean volume reduction ranged from 36.3% at 3 months to 49% at 6 months. The major postintervention complication rate was 1%. CONCLUSIONS: Unilateral native nephrectomy before kidney transplantation was associated with the lowest major postoperative complication rate and appears to be the preferred strategy. Arterial embolization reduces kidney volume by 49% at 6 months. Arterial embolization could be considered when the reduction in size of the native kidney is not urgent.
28316316	Colonic Diverticulosis and Diverticulitis in Renal Transplant Recipients: Management and Long-Term Outcomes.	Data regarding management of colonic diverticulitis in renal transplant recipients (RTRs) are limited. This study aims to identify prevalence, risk factors, and outcomes in RTRs with colonic diverticulosis and diverticulitis. Between January 2004 and December 2013, all patients who underwent kidney transplantation were analyzed. Among all RTSs, patients who had a pretransplant colonoscopic diagnosis of diverticulosis and patients with a proven attack of diverticulitis were included in our analysis. There were 1578 RTRs with a mean age of 50 +- 14 years at the time of transplantation. Of these, 409 patients had colonoscopic evaluation and 174 (43%) were diagnosed with diverticular disease. Fifteen (0.9%) out of 1578 developed a primary attack of diverticulitis. Two patients underwent a Hartmann's procedure due to perforation. Among 13 patients who were initially treated nonoperatively, 4 required surgery due to refractory diverticulitis (n = 2) and recurrence (n = 2). Tobacco use (59% vs 48%, P = 0.02), increased age (58 vs 51 years, P < 0.0001), diabetes (33% vs 35%, P = 0.03), coronary artery disease (38% vs 22%, P = 0.001), and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease etiology (P = 0.04) were more common in RTRs with diverticulosis. Majority of RTRs with diverticulitis can be managed nonoperatively. Surgical treatment is warranted in patients with perforated, persistent, and recurrent diverticulitis. A special care and follow-up may be needed in RTRs with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease etiology, smoking history, and coronary artery disease due to higher risk of diverticulosis and subsequent potential diverticulitis.
25348222	Pain in renal disease.	Pain is the presenting symptom in 20 to 30% of patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) and occurs in 50 to 60% of patients at some stage of the disease process, but its frequency increases with age and size of the cysts. Back pain is caused by kidney enlargement as well as rupture, hemorrhage, or infection of cysts. Other causes of pain include nephrolithiasis and urinary tract infections (UTIs). Analgesic options for patients with ADPKD include transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), spinal cord stimulation, low-dose opioids, and local anesthetics.
25778853	[End stage renal disease and ventricular arrhythmia. Hemodialysis and hemodiafiltration differently affect ventricular repolarization].	Various factors (hypertension [27%], diabetes mellitus [40%]) and their cardiovascular complications play an important role in the genesis of end stage renal disease. Furthermore, primary kidney diseases (glomerulonephritis, tubulointerstitial nephritis, obstructive uropathy, analgesic nephropathy, polycystic kidney disease, autoimmune diseases) have an unfavorable effect on the cardiovascular outcome of this particular population. Increased susceptibility for arrhythmias may be caused by intermittent volume overload, metabolic disturbance, renal anemia, structural and electrophysiological changes of the myocardium, inflammatory mechanisms that may worsen the mortality statistics of these patients. A novel renal replacement method, hemodiafiltration - based on a convective transport - ensures reduced mortality that may be attributed to a decreased occurrence of arrhythmias. The aim of this paper is to review the pathogenetic factors taking part in the arrhythmogenesis of end stage renal disease and to provide diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities that can help in the prediction and prevention of arrhythmias.
29782307	Cutaneous Manifestations of Tuberous Sclerosis.	Dear Editor, Tuberous sclerosis (TS) is an autosomal dominant multisystem disease, which occurs due to genetically determined hyperplasia of ectodermal and mesodermal cells. Clinical manifestations present on the skin and in the nervous system, kidneys, heart, and other organs. Recent studies estimate the incidence of TS at 1/6000 to 1/10,000 live births, and a prevalence in the general population of approximately 1 in 20,000 (1). There are two different genetic loci responsible for TS: 9q34 (TSC1-hamartin) and 16p13.3 (TSC2-tuberin) (2). Cutaneous manifestations occur in about 96% of patients (3). Neurological disorders occur in 50% of patients in the form of seizures and motor and psychomotor symptomatology (4). A 19-year-old male patient was hospitalized for clinical and diagnostic evaluation in February 2016 year in Clinic for Nephrology, Clinical Center of Montenegro, Podgorica, Montenegro. Polycystic kidney changes were verified by ultrasound when the patient was three years old, with the presence of several calcified nodules in lateral ventricles and supraventricularly in the brain as well as the existence of several hypopigmented maculae on the skin. During the last hospitalization in February 2016, the following tests were performed: cranial magnet resonance imaging (MRI) findings showed the existence of visible changes in the signal in the form of ectopic tuber tissue in the region of the cortex and subcortical white matter of the brain, but without neurological and psychomotor abnormalities; ultrasound of the urinary tract showed that both kidneys were enlarged with multiple cysts, with dominant cysts at the lower pole of the right kidney with a size of 55 mm and at the upper pole of the left kidney, approximately 40 mm. Reduced functional capacity of kidneys was found on dynamic scintigraphy, slightly more in the left kidney (41%) compared with the right (59%). Electroencephalography, X-ray of the lungs and heart, and echocardiography were also performed, but without any pathological findings. Dermatological examination found numerous fibroma up to 0.5 cm in diameter, the largest located nasolabially, periorally, and on the chin skin (Figure 1) at the age of seven, whereas a fibroma and several white maculae were present from birth on the skin of the forehead. They were now also present on the skin of the trunk and on the upper and lower extremities (Figure 2), accompanied by surrounding minor changes in the form of confetti-like maculae. A subungual fibroma was present on the third finger of the right hand. Collagen nevus (shagreen patch) (5), i.e. a subepidermal fibrosis as a mildly elevated, palm-sized area is also characteristic of TS, which is described in literature, in most cases in the lumbosacral region. In our case, such a fibrosis about 3 cm in diameter, and with the consistency of an orange peel, was discovered on the right shoulder. Subungual fibromas (Koenen tumors) (6), which can develop in adolescence, were present in our patient on the third finger of the right hand. The diagnosis of TS was established based on genetic testing, physical examination, ultrasound-verified polycystic kidney disease and reduced global renal functions, intracranial MRI, many hypomelanotic changes, and angiofibromas found with dermatological examination (7). There is no specific therapeutic approach for TS, and the treatment is symptomatic. Angiofibromas of the skin can be removed by dermabrasion or laser. Recent data show a good therapeutic effect of applying 0.1% rapamycin (8), which leads to a reduction of angiofibromas in patients with TS. On dermatological follow up after five weeks of application of tacrolimus, angiofibromas of the face were in regression. Some studies suggest the simultaneous topical applications of both of those drugs (9). In adolescents and adults of reproductive age, genetic counseling is recommended (10).
27881296	Is New-Onset Diabetes After Kidney Transplantation Associated with Autosomal-Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease in Recipients of Kidney Transplants? Incomplete Methodologies were Employed.	
34657906	Repetitive Refractory Renal Cyst Infection in Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease for which Renal Transcatheter Arterial Embolization Was Effective in Preventing Recurrence.	Renal cyst infection is a frequent and serious complication of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) that is often difficult to treat and can be fatal. While nephrectomy is the standard therapy for severe refractory renal cyst infection, it can be associated with severe adverse events. We experienced a case of repetitive renal cyst infection in a 58-year-old Japanese man with ADPKD on dialysis. He underwent renal transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) four months after the last episodes of renal cyst infection, and his renal cyst infection has not recurred since renal TAE. This case suggested that renal TAE is effective for preventing repetitive renal cyst infection.
30464138	Old-Age Onset Progressive Cardiac Contractile Dysfunction in a Patient with Polycystic Kidney Disease Harboring a PKD1 Frameshift Mutation.	A 70-year-old man with dyspnea was admitted to our department and received standard therapy for recurrent heart failure. He was diagnosed with polycystic kidney disease (PKD) in his thirties and received hemodialysis for 4 years before undergoing renal transplantation at age 45. Although his left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was preserved in his 50s, LVEF decreased progressively from 61% to 24%, while left ventricular diastolic dimension (LVDd) increased from 54 mm to 65 mm between 63 and 69 years of age. Right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy demonstrated myocardial disarray and interstitial fibrosis. Genetic analysis identified a heterozygous frameshift mutation in PKD1, which encodes polycystin-1, a major causative gene of PKD. We detected PKD1 protein expression in myocardial tissue by immunostaining. Recent epidemiological studies and animal models have clarified the pathological correlation between ventricular contractile dysfunction and PKD1 function. Here, we present a case of old-age onset progressive cardiac contractile dysfunction with a PKD1 gene mutation.
32506801	Risk factors for new-onset diabetes mellitus after kidney transplantation: A systematic review and meta-analysis.	AIMS/INTRODUCTION: To systematically review the risk factors for new-onset diabetes mellitus after kidney transplantation, and to provide a theoretical basis for the prevention and management of new-onset diabetes mellitus after kidney transplantation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, the Cochrane Library databases and other databases for case-control studies related to risk factors for new-onset diabetes mellitus after kidney transplantation published between January 2005 and July 2019. A meta-analysis of data on risk factors for new-onset diabetes mellitus after kidney transplantation from the included studies was carried out. A narrative review of risk factors for new-onset diabetes mellitus after kidney transplantation was also carried out. RESULTS: A total of 24 case-control studies were included in the meta-analysis, with a total of 7,140 patients. There were 1,598 patients with new-onset diabetes mellitus after kidney transplantation, and 5,542 patients without new-onset diabetes mellitus after kidney transplantation. The meta-analysis results showed that age, polycystic kidney disease, family history of diabetes, body mass index, acute rejection, tacrolimus use, hepatitis B virus infection, hepatitis C virus infection and hypertension were associated with new-onset diabetes mellitus after kidney transplantation, whereas sex, sirolimus use, cyclosporin A use, steroid use and cytomegalovirus infection were not associated with new-onset diabetes mellitus after kidney transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Older age, body mass index, family history of diabetes, tacrolimus use, history of hypertension, polycystic kidney disease, acute rejection, hepatitis B virus infection and hepatitis C virus infection are risk factors for new-onset diabetes mellitus after kidney transplantation. Therefore, the clinical implications of these factors warrant attention.
39203885	Compliance with a Healthful Plant-Based Diet Is Associated with Kidney Function in Patients with Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease.	Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a genetic kidney disorder with multiple cyst formation that progresses to chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage kidney disease. Plant-based diets have attracted considerable attention because they may prevent CKD development. This study investigated whether adherence to a plant-based diet is associated with kidney function in patients with ADPKD. The overall plant-based diet index (PDI), healthful PDI (hPDI), and unhealthful PDI (uPDI) were calculated using dietary intake data. Among 106 ADPKD patients, 37 (34.91%) were classified as having advanced CKD (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2). The overall PDI and hPDI were lower, but the uPDI was higher in patients with advanced CKD than in those with early CKD. The hPDI was negatively correlated with the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio. Moreover, the hPDI was inversely associated with advanced CKD [odds ratio (OR): 0.117 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.039-0.351), p < 0.001], and the uPDI was positively associated with advanced CKD [OR: 8.450 (95% CI: 2.810-25.409), p < 0.001]. The findings of the current study demonstrate that greater adherence to a healthful plant-based diet is associated with improved kidney function in ADPKD patients.
29037159	Bowel perforation by a peritoneal dialysis catheter: report of two cases.	BACKGROUND: Complications of peritoneal dialysis (PD) such as pain and catheter leakage are frequently reported. Delayed bowel perforation of a PD catheter is a rare adverse event but a serious complication associated with significant mortality. Bowel perforation of a PD catheter is difficult to differentiate from PD-related peritonitis and likely to result in a delay in diagnosis. Here, we report two cases of bowel perforation after PD catheter insertion by the stepwise initiation of PD using the Moncrief and Popovich technique (SMAP) and peritoneal wall anchor technique (PWAT). CASE PRESENTATION: The first case was a 53-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) due to diabetic nephropathy and a history of entero-adhesiolysis. She underwent PD catheter insertion by the SMAP with PWAT. Four months after PD catheter insertion, the catheter was found to perforate sigmoid colon. The second case was a 57-year-old woman with ESRD due to large polycystic kidney disease. She underwent the same procedure. After exteriorization of the catheter, she developed peritonitis due to perforation of the catheter tip into the bowel. Both patients were safely removed the catheter with uneventful recovery. CONCLUSION: We reported two cases of a rare complication of PD catheter. The SMAP method, PWAT, enlarged kidneys and migration of the lower cuff may be risk factors of bowel perforation of a PD catheter.
30102820	Kidney transplant recipients with polycystic kidney disease have a lower risk of post-transplant BK infection than those with end-stage renal disease due to other causes.	BACKGROUND: Polyomavirus-associated nephropathy is associated with high risk of kidney allograft loss. Whether the cause of native end-stage renal disease influences the risk of BK infection is unclear. METHODS: A retrospective, single-center study of 2741 adult kidney transplant recipients between 1994 and 2014 was performed. Recipients had end-stage renal disease due to polycystic kidney disease (PKD, n = 549), diabetes mellitus (DM, n = 947), hypertension (HTN, n = 442), or glomerulonephritis (GN, n = 803). RESULTS: A total of 327 recipients (12%) developed post-transplant BK viremia over a median follow-up time of 5 years. The incidence rate of BK viremia was lowest in patients with PKD (1.46 per 100 person-years) compared to other causes of ESRD (DM = 2.06, HTN = 2.65, and GN = 2.01 per 100 person-years). A diagnosis of PKD was associated with a lower risk of post-transplant BK viremia (adjusted HR (95% CI) = 0.67 (0.48-0.95), P = 0.02). BK nephropathy was significantly less common in patients with PKD (0.21 per 100 person-years) compared to those with HTN (0.80 per 100 person-years, P <= 0.001). Among patients with PKD, the risk of BK viremia was lower in patients with nephrectomy, compared to those without nephrectomy (adjusted HR (95% CI) = 0.42 (0.19-0.92), P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: ESRD due to PKD is associated with a lower risk of post-transplant BK infection. The renal tubular epithelial cells in PKD are unique; they are in a proliferative but non-differentiated state. Whether this characteristic of renal tubular epithelial cells alters the BK viral reservoir or replication in PKD patients warrants further study.
28260467	Outcome of Kidney Transplant in Patients with Polycystic Kidney Disease: A Single-Center Study in Tunisia.	OBJECTIVES: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is a common cause of end-stage renal disease and a common indication for renal transplant. This study was undertaken to evaluate the demographics, outcomes, and complications of renal transplant in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease compared with other nephropathies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a retrospective case-control design, we reviewed the records of 7 patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease from a total of 701 renal transplant patients over a 30-year period (1986-2016). For each patient, a matched control was selected based on sex, age, year of transplant, and type of kidney donor. We excluded patients who underwent kidney transplant abroad and those with a follow-up period of less than 2 years. RESULTS: The number of patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease requiring transplant at our center was estimated at 0.23 per year, and the condition represented 1.57% of initial nephropathy causes. The mean patient age at transplant was 50.8 +- 8.05 years. There were 5 male and 2 female patients in the case group, with a male-to-female ratio of 2.5. The source of the graft was predominantly a living related donor (5/7). Four patients had extrarenal manifestations, the most common of which were liver cysts (3 patients). Rejection occurred in a single study patient (14.2%) and in 4 control patients (57.1%; P = .51). Two patients did not develop any complications. Complications noted after transplant included infection (3/7 cases vs 2/7 controls; P= .67) and cerebrovascular accidents (2/7 cases vs 0/7 controls). CONCLUSIONS: Further studies with longer follow-up and greater numbers of patients are needed to compare more precisely the complications and results of transplant between patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and other kidney transplant recipients.
34269650	Primary Renal Squamous Cell Carcinoma in Native Polycystic Kidney and Ureter 16 Years After Living Donor Kidney Transplant.	We describe a case of a 55-year-old woman with polycystic kidney disease who received a living donor kidney transplant 16 years earlier and was on immunosuppressive therapy with satisfactory renal function. The donor was her mother. The patient presented with flank pain on the right side and macrohematuria, and noncontrast computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging led to the diagnosis of tumors in the remaining right native polycystic kidney and ureter, as well as secondary retroperitoneal dissemination. We performed right radical nephrectomy and ureterectomy with extirpation of 2 metastases; the left native kidney remained intact. Histology showed squamous metaplastic changes and invasive epithelial neoplasm in the lumen of the renal pelvis and ureter with extensive squamous differentiation positive for nuclear p63 as squamous cell immunohistochemical marker. After surgery, an immunosuppressive therapy with methylprednisolone was administered, without calcineurin inhibitors and mycophenolate mofetil. Twelve months later the patient was still alive, with a glomerular filtration rate of 29 mL/min. Needs remain for further treatment modalities in patients with primary squamous cell carcinoma in nonfunctioning kidneys and improvements in imaging technique accuracy.
26354561	Is CAPD a viable option among ADPKD with end stage renal disease population in India? Its outcomes and economics.	Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common inherited renal disease, with 50-75% of these patients requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT). The outcome of peritoneal dialysis (PD) in ADPKD with end-disease renal disease (ESRD) is not clearly defined, more so in developing countries. We conducted a retrospective analysis of the outcomes and economics of PD in these ESRD patients and compared them with other causes of ESRD on PD. Data were reviewed of all the PD patients who were followed-up at our institute from January 2007 to December 2011. The inclusion criteria were ADPKD patients who chose PD as the dialysis modality (Group 1), while age and gender-matched ESRD (other than ADPKD) patients who were started on PD during the same period were considered as the other group (Group 2). A total of 26 ADPKD patients underwent PD with an average size of kidneys among ADPKD ESRD patients of 15.2 + 2.1 cm. The overall peritonitis rates were similar among the compared groups. The median survival for the first peritonitis episodes were 1.2 and 1.8 years (95% confidence interval 0.82-1.91) for the control and ADPKD groups, respectively. The overall patient survival was 22 among PKD while five patients died among the control group. Among PKD, one patient died due to intra-cerebral bleed while one patient had severe cyst hemorrhage and infection, while three others had peritonitis and sepsis. Hernia was observed in four ADPKD patients, once on PD that was surgically corrected and PD was resumed in all. Two patients lost the catheter due to peritonitis while one patient had membrane failure while one underwent surgical exploration due to diverticulosis. PD treatment was not prevented by voluminous kidneys in any of these patients and no patient ceased PD treatment due to insufficient peritoneal space. Besides this, the cost on PD was much less as compared with that on hemodialysis (HD). PD is a reasonable mode of RRT among ADPKD, where HD is not possible or contraindicated with lesser risks to bleeding and infections, and the cost benefit favoring PD in general. 
31870441	Cluster of differentiation 8 and programmed cell death ligand 1 expression in triple-negative breast cancer combined with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and tuberous sclerosis complex: a case report.	BACKGROUND: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is defined as an inherited disorder characterized by renal cyst formation due to mutations in the PKD1 or PKD2 gene, whereas tuberous sclerosis complex is an autosomal dominant neurocutaneous syndrome caused by mutation or deletion of the TSC2 gene. A TSC2/PKD1 contiguous gene syndrome, which is caused by a chromosomal mutation that disrupts both the TSC2 and PKD1 genes, has been identified in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex and severe early-onset autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. The tumor tissue of patients with breast cancer with contiguous gene syndrome has a high mutation burden and produces several neoantigens. A diffuse positive immunohistochemistry staining for cluster of differentiation 8+ in the T cells of breast cancer tissue is consistent with neoantigen production due to high mutation burden. CASE PRESENTATION: A 61-year-old Japanese woman who had been undergoing dialysis for 23 years because of end-stage renal failure secondary to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease was diagnosed as having triple-negative breast cancer and underwent mastectomy in 2015. She had a history of epilepsy and skin hamartoma. Her grandmother, mother, two aunts, four cousins, and one brother were also on dialysis for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Her brother had epilepsy and a brain nodule. Another brother had a syndrome of kidney failure, intellectual disability, and diabetes mellitus, which seemed to be caused by mutation in the CREBBP gene. Immunohistochemistry of our patient's breast tissue showed cluster of differentiation 8 and programmed cell death ligand 1 positivity. CONCLUSIONS: Programmed cell death ligand 1 checkpoint therapy may be effective for recurrence of triple-negative breast cancer in a patient with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and tuberous sclerosis complex.
27553994	Recent advances in autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease.	Autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common genetic renal disease in adults, affecting one in every 1000 Australians. It is caused by loss-of-function heterozygous mutations in either PKD1 or PKD2 , which encode the proteins, polycystin-1 and polycystin-2 respectively. The disease hallmark is the development of hundreds of microscopic fluid-filled cysts in the kidney during early childhood, which grow exponentially and continuously through life at varying rates (between 2% and 10% per year), causing loss of normal renal tissue and up to a 50% lifetime risk of dialysis-dependent kidney failure. Other systemic complications include hypertensive cardiac disease, hepatic cysts, intracranial aneurysms, diverticular disease and hernias. Over the last two decades, advances in the genetics and pathogenesis of this disease have led to novel treatments that reduce the rate of renal cyst growth and may potentially delay the onset of kidney failure. New evidence indicates that conventional therapies (such as angiotensin inhibitors and statins) have mild attenuating effects on renal cyst growth and that systemic levels of vasopressin are critical for promoting renal cyst growth in the postnatal period. Identifying and integrating patient-centred perspectives in clinical trials is also being advocated. This review will provide an update on recent advances in the clinical management of ADPKD. 
37127564	Barriers and facilitators to the transplant process among patients living with polycystic kidney disease: a qualitative Approach.	BACKGROUND: Kidney transplant is the gold standard for renal replacement therapy in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), which is the fourth leading cause of kidney failure. Despite the medical and economic benefits of preemptive kidney transplant over dialysis before transplant, only 9-21% of qualifying patients receive preemptive transplants. Given the low rates of preemptive transplant, the aim of this study was to determine perceived facilitators and barriers to preemptive transplant among ADPKD patients using a qualitative approach. METHODS: Data were collected between July 2021 and January 2022 from virtual individual semi-structured interviews of 16 adult participants with ADPKD. Qualitative analysis of the recorded interviews was conducted to generate themes. RESULTS: Our findings revealed two themes specific for facilitators to preemptive transplant (social support and patient agency) and three themes specific to barriers for preemptive transplant (inadequate social support, gaps in knowledge, and institutional and systemic policies). The results also include various subthemes and the application of these themes to the social ecological model. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that increasing social support and patient agency, such as through patient navigator programs and encouraging effective communication between health care providers and patients, can facilitate the transplant process. Increasing dissemination of transplant knowledge from institutions and systems to patients through paired kidney exchange education and live donor outreach can also increase timely access to preemptive kidney transplants for patients with ADPKD. Our findings are limited by our single site study in the US, which may not apply to individuals experiencing different social, cultural, and health access conditions.
31988055	Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonitis: cause of acute hypercalcaemia in chronic haemodialysis patient.	A 76-year-old renal transplant patient due to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease who resumed chronic haemodialysis was admitted to our hospital for confusion and lassitude. He was afebrile and physical examination revealed diffuse bilateral rales with decreased respiratory sounds in lower right lung. Laboratory data showed hypercalcaemia (total calcium 3.92 mmol/L (normal range 2.2-2.6 mmol/L), ionised calcium 1.87 mmol/L (1.15-1.35 mmol/L)), low intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) 15 ng/L, (15-65 ng/L) and high 1,25(OH)2D3 128.9 pg/mL, (15.2-90.1 pg/mL). Chest CT-scan revealed bilateral apical lung lesions after 15 days of antibiotics. Bronchoalveolar sample was PCR positive for Pneumocystis jirovecii He was treated with an extra session of haemodialysis with 1.25 mmol/L dialysate calcium concentration, oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was started and oral corticosteroid dose increased to 1 mg/kg for 1 week. Hypercalcaemia decreased progressively after initiation of these treatments. We concluded a case of hypercalcaemia secondary to P. jirovecii infection.
30513520	Factors Influencing Cyst Infection in Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease.	BACKGROUND: Cyst infection is a frequent and serious complication of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) that is often difficult to treat. However, the factors influencing cyst infection are still unknown. Therefore, we investigated clinical factors related to the duration of hospitalization and death due to cyst infection. METHODS: All ADPKD patients undergoing cyst drainage or nephrectomy or partial hepatectomy at Toranomon Hospital from January 2004 to March 2016, in whom cyst fluid analysis showed bacteria or neutrophils indicating definite cyst infection, were reviewed retrospectively. Factors influencing the duration of hospitalization and death due to cyst infection were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 243 patients with cyst infection were enrolled, including 104 men and 139 women (mean age: 62.6 +- 10.0 years). Seventeen patients died of cyst infection. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that hepatomegaly, positive cyst contents culture, and the maximum white blood cell (WBC) count were significantly associated with death from cyst infection. Death was significantly more likely if patients had massive hepatomegaly (>=5,113.2 mL) compared with mild hepatomegaly (< 1,898.7 mL; odds ratio 38.1; 95% CI 2.9-492.6, p = 0.0004). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed that older age, dialysis duration, hepatic transcatheter arterial embolization, maximum WBC count, and hepatomegaly were significantly associated with longer hospital stay for cyst infection, while female sex, nephrectomy, serum albumin, and serum cholinesterase were significantly associated with shorter hospital stay. Discharge alive from hospital was significantly associated with massive hepatomegaly versus mild hepatomegaly (hazard ratio 0.0072; 95% CI 0.0008-0.0659, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Hepatomegaly was strongly associated with both death and longer hospital stay due to cyst infection.
24602778	Intravascular embolization therapy in patients with enlarged polycystic liver.	BACKGROUND: Hepatic transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) has become an accepted treatment option for patients with symptomatic autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) who also have polycystic liver disease and who are not good candidates for surgery. However, indications for TAE and long-term outcome with it are still unclear. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Symptomatic patients with ADPKD with polycystic liver disease who underwent hepatic TAE, June 2001 to December 2012, at Toranomon Hospital and whose liver volume data were available were studied (N=244; 56% on dialysis therapy, none with kidney transplants). Mean age was 55 +- 9 (SD) years, and mean liver volumes were 8,353 +- 2,807 and 6,626 +- 2,485 cm(3) in men and women, respectively. Target arteries were embolized from the periphery using platinum microcoils. PREDICTORS: Sex-specific quartiles (6,433, 8,142, and 9,574 cm(3) in men and 4,638, 6,078, and 8,181 cm(3) in women) of total liver volume pretreatment. OUTCOMES: All causes of mortality were obtained from medical records, followed up until July 31, 2013. MEASUREMENTS: Laboratory values were measured before TAE and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after. Organ volumes were measured pretreatment, then 6 and 12 months after, by summing the products of the organ areas traced in each computed tomographic image. RESULTS: Liver/cyst volume decreased to 94.7% (95% CI, 93.5%-95.8%) at 6 months and 90.8% (95% CI, 88.7%-92.9%) at 12 months of pretreatment volumes. Serum protein and hematocrit values improved significantly without liver damage. Survival was significantly better for patients with liver volume <= 9,574 cm(3) (men) and <= 8,181 cm(3) (women) than for those with larger livers (5-year survival, 69% and 48%; P=0.02). Infection and liver failure caused most deaths, especially in patients with larger livers. LIMITATIONS: Referral bias and lack of control group. CONCLUSIONS: Hepatic TAE appears to be a safe and less invasive option for patients with symptomatic polycystic liver, especially those contraindicated for surgical treatment (eg, with malnutrition or on dialysis therapy), improving both hepatic volume and nutrition.
25092149	Polycystic kidney disease: Progression of polycystic kidney disease--a lack of progress?	
24999965	Laparoscopic nephrectomy for adult polycystic kidney disease: safety, feasibility, and early outcomes.	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Indications for laparoscopic renal surgery are increasing; however, benefits in adult polycystic kidney disease (APKD) remain uncertain. Our objective was to systematically synthesize the reported literature on safety, feasibility, complications, and early outcomes of laparoscopic nephrectomy in APKD to determine clinical benefits for surgical practice. METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis of the published literature reporting on laparoscopic nephrectomy in APKD between 1991 and 2013. The criteria from the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) study were used to assess the quality of reported literature. RESULTS: One prospective and 15 retrospective studies of low to modest quality (according to the STROBE checklist) were identified, reporting on 293 patients who underwent laparoscopic nephrectomy for APKD. None of the studies was a randomized clinical trial (RCT). The transperitoneal approach was the most commonly used technique. Body mass index ranged from 16 to 57 (mean 26.2 kg/m(2); 53% of patients were dialysis dependent, and 31% had a previous or simultaneous transplant. Kidney length ranged from 8 to 50 cm (mean 34.5cm), and the mean mass of affected kidneys was 1647 g (range 132 g-7200 g). Duration of hospital stay ranged from 2.6 to 11 days (mean 4.9 days). Operative time ranged from 90 to 568 minutes, with 16.2% of patients needing blood transfusion. There were 24 intraoperative complications and 68 postoperative complications, a rate of 8% and 24%, respectively. A total of 16 (5%) cases were converted to an open technique. No mortality was reported in any of the included studies. CONCLUSION: The quality of the included studies is poor, and it is difficult to argue for or against change in clinical practice because the evidence included is of level 3 and 4 only. Higher quality studies are needed to demonstrate that the technique is generalizable across all populations.
34330770	Early Postoperative Basal Insulin Therapy versus Standard of Care for the Prevention of Diabetes Mellitus after Kidney Transplantation: A Multicenter Randomized Trial.	BACKGROUND: Post-transplantation diabetes mellitus (PTDM) might be preventable. METHODS: This open-label, multicenter randomized trial compared 133 kidney transplant recipients given intermediate-acting insulin isophane for postoperative afternoon glucose >=140 mg/dl with 130 patients given short-acting insulin for fasting glucose >=200 mg/dl (control). The primary end point was PTDM (antidiabetic treatment or oral glucose tolerance test-derived 2 hour glucose >=200 mg/dl) at month 12 post-transplant. RESULTS: In the intention-to-treat population, PTDM rates at 12 months were 12.2% and 14.7% in treatment versus control groups, respectively (odds ratio [OR], 0.82; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.39 to 1.76) and 13.4% versus 17.4%, respectively, at 24 months (OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.34 to 1.49). In the per-protocol population, treatment resulted in reduced odds for PTDM at 12 months (OR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.16 to 1.01) and 24 months (OR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.24 to 1.20). After adjustment for polycystic kidney disease, per-protocol ORs for PTDM (treatment versus controls) were 0.21 (95% CI, 0.07 to 0.62) at 12 months and 0.35 (95% CI, 0.14 to 0.87) at 24 months. Significantly more hypoglycemic events (mostly asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic) occurred in the treatment group versus the control group. Within the treatment group, nonadherence to the insulin initiation protocol was associated with significantly higher odds for PTDM at months 12 and 24. CONCLUSIONS: At low overt PTDM incidence, the primary end point in the intention-to-treat population did not differ significantly between treatment and control groups. In the per-protocol analysis, early basal insulin therapy resulted in significantly higher hypoglycemia rates but reduced odds for overt PTDM-a significant reduction after adjustment for baseline differences-suggesting the intervention merits further study.Clinical Trial registration number: NCT03507829.
34739738	Genetic testing, ultrasonography and preimplantation genetic testing of men with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease in Hunan, China.	The present study identified novel mutations in polycystic kidney disease (PKD) genes in China, determined the prevalence of cysts in the genital tract and accessory gonad in autosomal dominant PKD (ADPKD) patients, correlated these genes with ADPKD and male infertility and investigated whether male infertility associated with ADPKD affected the clinical outcomes in a preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) cycle cohort. This study was a cross-sectional study. Twenty-four unrelated men with ADPKD recruited from the Reproductive and Genetic Hospital of CITIC-Xiangya in China were investigated between January 2019 and December 2020. A total of 24 variations were identified in 22 patients, including 23, 1 and 0 variations in PKD1, PKD2 and GANAB, respectively. Genital tract and accessory gonadal cysts were significant dependent variables for male infertility. A diagnosis was made in 87.04% (94/108) and 51.85% (56/108) of the embryos for ADPKD and PGT-A respectively. Clinical pregnancy reached 72.73% per embryo transfer and 84.21% per patient. We identified a group of novel mutations in PKD genes, which enriches the PKD mutation spectrum. Although genital tract and accessory gonadal cysts greatly influence the fertility of men with ADPKD, they have minimal clinical consequences on pregnancy by intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and PGT.
29361078	Outcome of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease patients on peritoneal dialysis: a national retrospective study based on two French registries (the French Language Peritoneal Dialysis Registry and the French Renal Epidemiology and Information Network).	Background: Pathological features of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) include enlarged kidney volume, higher frequency of digestive diverticulitis and abdominal wall hernias. Therefore, many nephrologists have concerns about the use of peritoneal dialysis (PD) in ADPKD patients. We aimed to analyse survival and technique failure in ADPKD patients treated with PD. Methods: We conducted two retrospective studies on patients starting dialysis between 2000 and 2010. We used two French registries: the French Renal Epidemiology and Information Network (REIN) and the French language Peritoneal Dialysis Registry (RDPLF). Using the REIN registry, we compared the clinical features and outcomes of ADPKD patients on PD (n = 638) with those of ADPKD patients on haemodialysis (HD) (n = 4653); with the RDPLF registry, those same parameters were determined for ADPKD patients on PD (n = 797) and compared with those of non-ADPKD patients on PD (n = 12 059). Results: A total of 5291 ADPKD patients and 12 059 non-ADPKD patients were included. Analysis of the REIN registry found that ADPKD patients treated with PD represented 10.91% of the ADPKD population. During the study period, PD was used for 11.2% of the non-ADPKD population. Compared with ADPKD patients on HD, ADPKD patients on PD had higher serum albumin levels (38.8 +- 5.3 versus 36.8 +- 5.7 g/dL, P < 0.0001) and were less frequently diabetic (5.31 versus 7.71%, P < 0.03). The use of PD in ADPKD patients was positively associated with the occurrence of a kidney transplantation but not with death [hazard ratio 1.15 (95% confidence interval 0.84-1.58)]. Analysis of the RDPLF registry found that compared with non-ADPKD patients on PD, ADPKD patients on PD were younger and had fewer comorbidities and better survival. ADPKD status was not associated with an increased risk of technique failure or an increased risk of peritonitis. Conclusions: According to our results, PD is proposed to a selected population of ADPKD patients, PD does not have a negative impact on ADPKD patients' overall survival and PD technique failure is not influenced by ADPKD status. Therefore PD is a reasonable option for ADPKD patients.
25501411	Successful treatment of chronic disseminated intravascular coagulation using recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin in a dialysis patient with dissecting aortic aneurysm.	A 62-year-old man had a history of acute aortic dissection (Stanford type A) and had been diagnosed with polycystic kidney disease three years earlier, and then developed end-stage renal failure. He was referred with chief complaints of difficult hemostasis and consecutive hemorrhagic episodes at the puncture site of the shunt soon after dialysis introduction. We suspected chronic disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) due to mild thrombocytopenia and a fibrinolytic system abnormality. Plasma factor XIII activity was decreased, but no inhibitor was detected. In addition, contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed exacerbation of a dissecting aortic aneurysm. We finally diagnosed chronic DIC and secondary factor XIII deficiency associated with the aortic aneurysm. We selected treatment involving recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin (rTM) because he was on maintenance dialysis and required long-term follow-up bofore the operation. Hemostatic function improved with regular administration of rTM, and was well-controlled preoperatively.
27234748	Clinical Outcome of Simultaneous Native Nephrectomy and Kidney Transplantation in Patients With Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease.	BACKGROUND: End-stage renal disease patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease may require native nephrectomy for various indications. However, the appropriate timing for nephrectomy in kidney transplantation and its effect on allograft survival have not been fully investigated. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 41 kidney transplant recipients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease in whom transplantation was done simultaneously, after, or without native nephrectomy at Seoul St. Mary's hospital between January 1987 and February 2014. We divided patients into 2 groups based on when native nephrectomy was performed: simultaneously (group A, n = 13) and after or without nephrectomy (group B, n = 28), and compared perioperative outcomes, posttransplantation complications, and allograft survival rates. RESULTS: The mean operative time was significantly longer in group A than in group B (6.48 +- 1.84 vs 5.27 +- 0.84 hours; P = .048). The mean numbers of units required for intraoperative blood transfusions were also significantly higher in group A than in group B (3.66 +- 3.43 vs 0.75 +- 0.26 units; P = .018). However, there were no differences between groups in the incidence of acute rejection and other complications such as postoperative bleeding and infectious complications (P > .05, for all). The allograft survival rate also did not differ between groups (P > .05). CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that patients undergoing simultaneous nephrectomy and kidney transplantations had clinical outcomes, in terms of complications and allograft survival, that were comparable to those in patients undergoing kidney transplantations with or without previous nephrectomy.
26908766	Management of renal cyst infection in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease: a systematic review.	Background: Renal cyst infection is one of the complications faced by patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Cyst infection is often difficult to treat and potentially leads to sepsis and death. No evidence-based treatment strategy exists. We therefore performed a systematic review to develop an effective approach for the management of renal cyst infection in ADPKD patients based on the literature. Methods: A systematic search was performed in PubMed (January 1948-February 2014), EMBASE (January 1974-February 2014) and the Cochrane Library (until February 2014) according to the PRISMA guidelines. Results: We identified 60 manuscripts that included 85 ADPKD patients with renal cyst infection (aged 52 +- 12 years, 45% male, 27% on dialysis, 13% history of renal transplantation and 6% diabetes mellitus). Included patients received a total of 160 treatments of which 92 were antimicrobial, 29 percutaneous and 39 surgical. Initial management often consisted of antimicrobials (79%), and quinolone-based regimens were favoured (34%). Overall, 61% of patients failed initial treatment, but treatment failure has decreased over time (before the year 2000: 75%; during and after the year 2000: 51%, P = 0.03). Post-renal obstruction, urolithiasis, atypical or resistant pathogens, short duration of antimicrobial treatment and renal function impairment were documented in patients failing treatment. Conclusions: First-line treatment of renal cyst infection in ADPKD consists of antimicrobials and is associated with a high rate of failure, but treatment success has increased over recent years. A large-scale unbiased registry is needed to define the optimal strategy for renal cyst infection management in ADPKD.
34472318	[A Case of Multiple Renal Carcinomas with Three Different Subtypes].	We report a case of dialysis kidney with multiple renal carcinomas in three locations. A 74-year-old man who had a 20-year history of dialysis, was admitted to our hospital complaining of sudden right lateral area pain. Computed tomography (CT) scan revealed hemorrhage from the right dialyzed renal subcapsule. He underwent immediate transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE), but after 6 days the CT scan showed new active bleeding. A second TAE was performed, but, the CT scan several days later showed hemorrhage from the same site. So we decided to perform a right radical nephrectomy. Pathological results revealed three different renal carcinomas at sites different from the bleeding site. The presence of triple carcinomas in the same organ of the kidney is quite rare. Because of the high incidence of renal carcinoma associated with polycystic kidney disease in long-term hemodialysis patients and the possibility of multiple carcinomas as in this case, radical nephrectomy is recommended even in the case of spontaneous rupture.
26270278	Platelet counts in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.	Platelet counts in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) have been reported to be lower than in control populations in one small study but data are sparse. We retrospectively audited real world platelet data from 290 ADPKD patients with corresponding age and sex-matched controls. We analysed 42,972 individual blood counts and patients with ADPKD had statistically lower platelet counts (213 +- 63 vs. 238 +- 69 x 10(9)/L, p < 0.01) on dialysis. In the transplant and chronic kidney disease (CKD) groups, there were no significant differences in the platelet counts. The magnitude of the difference in platelet numbers was small and unlikely to be clinically significant, so findings of low platelets in ADPKD should be further investigated.
29033415	Liver Cyst Infection after Colon Endoscopic Mucosal Resection in a Patient with Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease on Maintenance Hemodialysis.	A 60-year-old Japanese man with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) on maintenance hemodialysis underwent colonoscopy and endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR). He was hospitalized after 4 days of fever that began the day following colonoscopy. We detected Klebsiella pneumoniae in a blood culture and a ring-shaped integration in the liver cyst by gallium scintigraphy. He recovered with antibiotics and percutaneous drainage. The patient was believed to have contracted the liver cyst infection via an injured colonic mucosa and portal vein. Thus, if a patient exhibits fever after a colon EMR, for patients with ADPKD, then a liver cyst infection should also be considered in the differential diagnosis.
26899590	Intra-arterial nitroglycerin for intra-operative arterial vasospasm during pediatric renal transplantation.	Intra-operative arterial vasospasm during pediatric renal transplantation is an urgent clinical situation resulting in end-organ ischemia, associated changes in parenchymal turgor and color, diminished flow on ultrasound, and if left untreated, allograft loss. We hypothesized that intra-operative intra-arterial injection of nitroglycerin would reverse vasospasm and improve renal perfusion. A three-yr-old girl with end-stage renal disease due to autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease on peritoneal dialysis underwent deceased donor renal transplantation. After optimal immediate reperfusion and hemodynamic parameters, the kidney lost turgor and became mottled in appearance despite adequate hilar arterial and venous Doppler waveforms. Two aliquots of 40 mug (0.4 mL of a 100 mug/mL) nitroglycerin solution were injected directly into the renal artery 10 min apart. Nitroglycerin resulted in dramatic change in the consistency and appearance of the allograft. An improvement in renal blood flow was demonstrated by ultrasound after the second intra-arterial nitroglycerin injection with only a transient decrease in systemic arterial blood pressure. The child experienced normal allograft perfusion on serial postoperative ultrasounds, with a prompt decrease in serum creatinine and excellent diuresis. Intra-arterial nitroglycerin is a promising option for intra-operative arterial vasospasm during pediatric renal transplantation with objective improvement in blood flow and perfusion. 
26738331	[Related reproductive issues on male autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease].	Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a most common inherited renal disease, about 50% with a family history, although the exact etiology not yet clear. To date, ADPKD, a multisystem disorder without effective preventive and therapeutic means, has been shown to be detrimental to human health. Recent studies show that severe oligoasthenozoospermia, necrospermia, immotile sperm, azoospermia, epididymal cyst, seminal vesicle cyst, and ejaculatory duct cyst found in male ADPKD patients may lead to male infertility, though the specific mechanisms remain unknown. Structural anomaly of spermatozoa, defect of polycystin, mutation of PKD genes, and micro-deletion of the AZF gene could be the reasons for the higher incidence of abnormal semen quality in male ADPKD patients. Assisted reproductive techniques can increase the chances of pregnancy, whereas the health of the offspring should be taken into consideration. This article presents an overview of reproductive issues concerning infertile male ADPKD patients from the perspective of the morbidity, pathophysiological mechanism, diagnosis, and management of the disease.
33939064	A comprehensive PGT-M strategy for ADPKD patients with de novo PKD1 mutations using affected embryo or gametes as proband.	Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common inherited kidney disease characterized by the development of renal cysts and progression to renal failure. Preimplantation genetic testing-monogenic disease (PGT-M) is an alternative option to obtain healthy babies. However, de novo PKD1 mutation of one of the spouses or the absence of a positive family history poses a serious challenge to PGT-M. Here, we described a comprehensive strategy which includes preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidies (PGT-A) study and monogenic diagnosis study for ADPKD patients bearing de novo mutations. The innovation of our strategy is to use the gamete (polar body or single sperm) as proband for single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) linkage analysis to detect an embryo's carrier status. Nine ADPKD couples with either de novo mutation or without a positive family history were recruited and a total of 34 embryos from 13 PGT-M cycles were examined. Within these nine couples, two successfully delivered healthy babies had their genetic status confirmed by amniocentesis. This study provides a creative approach for embryo diagnosis of patients with de novo mutations or patients who lack essential family members for linkage analysis.
35309838	A Retrospective Case-Control Study on Late Failure of Arteriovenous Fistula in Hemodialysis Patients and Prediction of Risk Factors.	Objective: A retrospective case-control study was conducted to explore the risk factors of late failure of arteriovenous fistula in hemodialysis patients. Methods: A total of 95 hemodialysis patients treated in our hospital from January 2018 to January 2021 were included. The HE staining results of late failure of arteriovenous fistula in hemodialysis patients were observed. The general data and laboratory indexes of the patients were recorded by using a questionnaire survey, hospital case system, and hemodialysis record. According to the functional status of internal fistula, the patients were divided into two groups: failure group (n = 35) and patency group (n = 60). SPSS22.0 software was employed for statistical analysis, and the relevant data of the two groups were compared. The independent sample t-test was employed for the comparison of variance between groups, and the chi 2 test was employed for counting data. Logistic multivariate regression was employed to analyze the risk factors of late loss of power in autologous arteriovenous fistula (AVF). Results: (1) Late failure of arteriovenous fistula in hemodialysis patients: the results of HE staining showed the following: (1) histological changes of venous intima: 100% of the patients had varying degrees of intimal hyperplasia, mainly eccentric hyperplasia, resulting in luminal stenosis, and annular uniform intimal hyperplasia in some patients, and (2) histological changes of venous media: 81.6% of the patients had venous media lesions, which were mainly in two cases; one was media smooth muscle hyperplasia with fibrous tissue hyperplasia, and the other was smooth muscle compression when intimal hyperplasia was serious, resulting in smooth muscle fiber rupture, disarrangement, focal necrosis, atrophy, and thinning, and some smooth muscle stroma showed vitreous degeneration and myxoid degeneration. A few cases showed multifocal neutrophil, lymphocyte, and plasma cell infiltration. (2) First of all, we surveyed the general data, and there were significant differences in age, history of diabetes, history of hypertension, and uric acid nephropathy (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in sex, body mass index, smoking history, polycystic kidney disease, chronic glomerulonephritis, and obstructive nephropathy between the two groups (P > 0.05). Secondly, we compared the levels of hemoglobin, eosinophils, platelet count, and hematocrit. The levels of hemoglobin, eosinophils, and hematocrit in the failure group were higher, and the platelet count was lower compared to that of the unobstructed group (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the calcium and phosphorus product and the level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the failure group were higher, while the levels of fibrinogen and INR in the unobstructed group were lower. The levels of plasma protein, alkaline phosphatase, and cholesterol were higher in the failure group, while the level of triglyceride was lower in the failure group (P < 0.05). Finally, logistic regression analysis showed that age, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and calcium-phosphorus product were the risk factors for late failure of arteriovenous fistula in hemodialysis patients (P < 0.05). There exhibited no significant correlation between diabetes, hypertension, uric acid nephropathy, eosinophil, CRP, fibrinogen, INR, plasma protein, alkaline phosphatase, cholesterol, triglyceride, and late failure of arteriovenous fistula in hemodialysis patients. Conclusion: Age, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and calcium-phosphorus product are independent risk factors for late failure of arteriovenous fistula in hemodialysis patients. The hemoglobin, eosinophil, platelet count, and hematocele in hemodialysis patients with late failure of arteriovenous fistula were higher. The indexes related to biochemistry, blood coagulation, and nutrition were significantly different from those without late failure of arteriovenous fistula. Thus, the risk of late failure of arteriovenous fistula can be predicted.
34688508	Staged versus concurrent native nephrectomy and renal transplantation in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease: A systematic review.	BACKGROUND: Patients with Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) frequently undergo native nephrectomy before transplantation. The nephrectomy may be a staged procedure or undertaken simultaneously with transplantation. When performed simultaneously, the transplant procedure is more prolonged, involves a larger operative field and incision. There is also a concern of a greater risk of graft loss with simultaneous nephrectomy and transplantation. Moreover, staged surgery may allow nephrectomy to be performed before immunosuppression introduction via a smaller incision or involving a minimally invasive approach. However, staged nephrectomy may require a period of dialysis not otherwise necessary if a transplant and nephrectomy were simultaneous. Moreover, only a single procedure is needed, implying the avoidance of a prior nephrectomy and its attendant morbidity in a patient with chronic renal insufficiency. To account for these issues, this study aims to compare the cumulative morbidity of two-staged procedures versus a single simultaneous approach in term of morbidity and graft outcomes. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to systematically review the literature to determine whether a staged or simultaneous approach to native nephrectomy in ADPKD is the optimal approach in terms of morbidity and graft outcomes. METHODS: A literature search of MEDLINE and EMBASE was conducted to identify published systematic reviews, randomized control trials, case-controlled studies and case studies. Data comparing outcomes of staged and simultaneous nephrectomy for patients undergoing kidney transplantation was extracted and analyzed. The main outcomes analyzed were length of hospitalization, blood loss, operative time, other early postoperative complications and risk of graft thrombosis. Meta-analysis was conducted where appropriate. RESULTS: Seven retrospective cohort studies were included in the review. There was a total of 385 patients included in the analysis, of whom 273 patients underwent simultaneous native nephrectomy and kidney transplantation. Meta-analysis showed an increased cumulative operative time in staged procedures (RR 1.86;95% CI 0.43-3.29 p = 0.01) and increased risk of blood transfusions (RR 2.69; 95% CI 1.92-3.46 p < 0.00001). For the transplant procedure, there were no significant difference in the length of stay (RR 1.03; 95% CI -2.01-4.14 p = 0.52), major postoperative complications (RR 0.02; 95% CI -0.15-0.10 p = 0.74) and vascular thromboses (RR 1.42 95% CI 0.23-8.59 p = 0.7). CONCLUSION: The results suggest that staged nephrectomy followed by kidney transplantation is associated with a longer cumulative operative time and increased cumulative risk of blood transfusions. There is no evidence to suggest that performing a simultaneous nephrectomy and kidney transplant procedure increases the perioperative mortality rate, major postoperative complication rates or risk of vascular thrombosis.
38512371	Native nephrectomy in polycystic kidney disease patients on transplant lists: how and when?	Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), the most common hereditary kidney disease, accounts for approximately 10% of the patients on kidney transplantation waitlists. High rates of complications including hemorrhage, infections, nephrolithiasis and kidney size-related compressive complaints have been reported among ADPKD patients. Therefore, the need for routine native nephrectomy and timing of such procedure in ADPKD patients being prepared for transplantation are debated. Even though pre-transplant nephrectomy has the potential to provide fewer infectious complications due to lack of immunosuppressive medication use, such procedure has been associated with longer hospital stay, loss of residual kidney function and need for dialysis. Although simultaneous nephrectomy and transplantation could potentially lead to longer perioperative duration, perioperative complications and need for blood transfusions, this was not confirmed in cohort studies. Therefore, some institutions routinely perform simultaneous unilateral nephrectomy and kidney transplantation. In this narrative review, our aim is to evaluate the current evidence regarding the need and timing of nephrectomy in ADPKD patients in relation to kidney transplantation.
31857138	Pathologic characterization of renal epithelial neoplasms arising in nonfunctioning kidneys.	Nonfunctioning kidneys secondary to various etiologies display different histopathological features. Studies focused on incidence and types of renal neoplasms using the new World Health Organization and International Society of Urological Pathology classification system in various types of nonfunctioning kidneys are very limited. We identified 311 nephrectomies of nonfunctioning kidneys and categorized them into 5 categories: acquired cystic kidney disease (ACKD, n = 61); end-stage renal disease, nonspecific (ESRD, n = 63); adult polycystic kidney disease (APKD, n = 49); failed transplant kidney (FTK, n = 96); and those caused by obstructive conditions in the kidney (OCK, n = 42). ACKD (70%) and ESRD (43%) had higher cancer incidences than the other 3 groups (APKD = 2%, FTK = 0%, and OCK = 5%). Besides clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and papillary RCC, clear cell papillary RCC had a much higher incidence within ACKD patients (13/61) compared to other groups. ACKD-associated RCC was only identified in ACKD patients. ACKD patients had significantly longer dialysis duration compared to ESRD, APKD, and FTK. Although they had similar risk for clear cell RCC and papillary RCC, ACKD patients had a much higher risk for ACKD-associated RCC and clear cell papillary RCC than ESRD patients. Although most RCCs arising in these nonfunctioning kidneys were early pT1 stage, 6 ACKD patients and 3 ESRD patients had higher-stage diseases, which can be fatal if not treated appropriately. Therefore, precise clinicopathological classification of these nonfunctioning kidneys is important for predicting kidney cancer risk. These results indicate the need for active monitoring of the patients with high-risk nonfunctioning kidney diseases and appropriate surgical treatment when necessary.

34480075	The effect of trichlormethiazide in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease patients receiving tolvaptan: a randomized crossover controlled trial.	The vasopressin V2 receptor antagonist tolvaptan delays the progression of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). However, some patients discontinue tolvaptan because of severe adverse aquaretic events. This open-label, randomized, controlled, counterbalanced, crossover trial investigated the effects of trichlormethiazide, a thiazide diuretic, in patients with ADPKD receiving tolvaptan (n = 10) who randomly received antihypertensive therapy with or without trichlormethiazide for 12 weeks. The primary and secondary outcomes included amount and osmolarity of 24-h urine and health-related quality-of-life (HRQOL) parameters assessed by the Kidney Disease Quality of Life-Short Form questionnaire, renal function slope, and plasma/urinary biomarkers associated with disease progression. There was a significant reduction in urine volume (3348 +- 584 vs. 4255 +- 739 mL; P < 0.001) and a significant increase in urinary osmolarity (182.5 +- 38.1 vs. 141.5 +- 38.1 mOsm; P = 0.001) in patients treated with trichlormethiazide. Moreover, trichlormethiazide improved the following HRQOL subscales: effects of kidney disease, sleep, emotional role functioning, social functioning, and role/social component summary. No significant differences were noted in renal function slope or plasma/urinary biomarkers between patients treated with and without trichlormethiazide. In patients with ADPKD treated with tolvaptan, trichlormethiazide may improve tolvaptan tolerability and HRQOL parameters.
29775233	Dialysis modality and mortality in polycystic kidney disease.	INTRODUCTION: Identifying the appropriate modality between hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) is an unresolved issue in polycystic kidney disease (PKD) patients. This study aims to illustrate whether the mortality and survival are different among individuals receiving HD comparing PD. METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure about cohort studies involving PKD patients with end stage renal disease and comparing HD with PD. We calculated pooled risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous data. Primary outcomes were the mortality and survival (not the technique survival). FINDINGS: Eight studies involving 7685 PKD patients were identified. There were no significant differences in mortality (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.84-1.34, P = 0.61) and 5-year survival rate (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.80-1.22, P = 0.90) between HD and PD. PD was not associated with higher risks of abdominal infections and hernia. However, HD was associated with a higher incidence of renal cyst hemorrhage (RR 2.53, 95% CI 1.05-6.12, P = 0.04). DISCUSSION: There are no significant differences of mortality and survival between different dialysis modalities in PKD. PD may be as successful as HD for PKD patients receiving renal replacement therapy.
30340529	Cyst infection in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease: penetration of meropenem into infected cysts.	"BACKGROUND: Cyst infection is a common and serious complication of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) that is often refractory. Carbapenems are frequently needed to treat to patients with refractory cyst infection, but little is known about the penetration of newer water-soluble carbapenems into cysts. This study investigated the penetration of meropenem (MEPM) into infected cysts in patients with ADPKD. METHODS: Between August 2013 and January 2014, 10 ADPKD patients (14 infected cysts) receiving MEPM at Toranomon Hospital underwent drainage of infected cysts and definite cyst infection was confirmed through detection of neutrophils by cyst fluid analysis. The serum concentration of MEPM was measured just after intravenous administration and was compared with that in fluid aspirated from infected cysts. RESULTS: In the patients undergoing cyst drainage, the mean serum MEPM concentration was 35.2 +- 12.2 mug/mL (range: 19.7 to 59.2 mug/mL, while the mean cyst fluid concentration of MEPM in the drained liver cysts (n = 12) or kidney cysts (n = 2) was 3.03 +- 2.6 mug/mL (range: 0 to 7.3 mug/mL). In addition, the mean cyst fluid/serum MEPM concentration ratio was 9.46 +- 7.19% (range: 0 to 18.8%). There was no relationship between the cyst fluid concentration of MEPM and the time until drainage after MEPM administration or between the cyst fluid/serum MEPM concentration ratio and the time until drainage. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that MEPM shows poor penetration into infected cysts in ADPKD patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was registered with the University Hospital Medical Information Network (UMIN) as ""Penetration of meropenem into cysts in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD)"", UMIN ID 000011292 on July 26th, 2013."
30333007	Novel mutations of PKD genes in Chinese patients suffering from autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and seeking assisted reproduction.	BACKGROUND: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), the commonest inherited kidney disease, is generally caused by heterozygous mutations in PKD1, PKD2, or GANAB (PKD3). METHODS: We performed mutational analyses of PKD genes to identify causative mutations. A set of 90 unrelated families with ADPKD were subjected to mutational analyses of PKD genes. Genes were analysed using long-range PCR (LR-PCR), direct PCR sequencing, followed by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) or screening of GANAB for some patients. Semen quality was assessed for 46 male patients, and the correlation between mutations and male infertility was analysed. RESULTS: A total of 76 mutations, including 38 novel mutations, were identified in 77 families, comprising 72 mutations in PKD1 and 4 in PKD2, with a positive detection rate of 85.6%. No pathogenic mutations of GANAB were detected. Thirty-seven patients had low semen quality and were likely to be infertile. No association was detected between PKD1 mutation type and semen quality. However, male patients carrying a pathogenic mutation in the Ig-like repeat domain of PKD1 had a high risk of infertility. CONCLUSION: Our study identified a group of novel mutations in PKD genes, which enrich the PKD mutation spectrum and might help clinicians to make precise diagnoses, thereby allowing better family planning and genetic counselling. Men with ADPKD accompanied by infertility should consider intracytoplasmic sperm injection combined with preimplantation genetic diagnosis to achieve paternity and obtain healthy progeny.
25399731	Angiotensin blockade in late autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.	BACKGROUND: Hypertension develops early in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) and is associated with disease progression. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is implicated in the pathogenesis of hypertension in patients with ADPKD. Dual blockade of the RAAS may circumvent compensatory mechanisms that limit the efficacy of monotherapy with an angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin II-receptor blocker (ARB). METHODS: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we randomly assigned 486 patients, 18 to 64 years of age, with ADPKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate [GFR], 25 to 60 ml per minute per 1.73 m(2) of body-surface area) to receive an ACE inhibitor (lisinopril) and placebo or lisinopril and an ARB (telmisartan), with the doses adjusted to achieve a blood pressure of 110/70 to 130/80 mm Hg. The composite primary outcome was the time to death, end-stage renal disease, or a 50% reduction from the baseline estimated GFR. Secondary outcomes included the rates of change in urinary aldosterone and albumin excretion, frequency of hospitalizations for any cause and for cardiovascular causes, incidence of pain, frequency of ADPKD-related symptoms, quality of life, and adverse study-medication effects. Patients were followed for 5 to 8 years. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the study groups in the incidence of the composite primary outcome (hazard ratio with lisinopril-telmisartan, 1.08; 95% confidence interval, 0.82 to 1.42). The two treatments controlled blood pressure and lowered urinary aldosterone excretion similarly. The rates of decline in the estimated GFR, urinary albumin excretion, and other secondary outcomes and adverse events, including hyperkalemia and acute kidney injury, were also similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Monotherapy with an ACE inhibitor was associated with blood-pressure control in most patients with ADPKD and stage 3 chronic kidney disease. The addition of an ARB did not alter the decline in the estimated GFR.

28877825	Effectiveness of Peritoneal Dialysis in Treating Adult End Stage Renal Disease Patients with Polycystic Kidney Disease.	Objective To observe the clinical characteristics,dialysis modalities,and outcomes of end stage renal disease(ESRD)patients with polycystic kidney disease(PKD)and to evaluate the feasibility of peritoneal dialysis in these population. Methods The clinical data of ESRD patient whose primary diagnosis was PKD in Peking Union Medical College Hospital were retrospectively collected from January 1993 to December 2015.PKD patients were divided into two groups according to dialysis modality,namely peritoneal dialysis group(PKD-PD)group and hemodialysis(PKD-HD)group.In addition,we randomly chose non-PKD patients from 622 peritoneal dialysis patients who were matched with PKD-PD patients in age,gender and dialysis time.The primary end point was death.The survival rate was calculated by Kaplan-Meier analysis and the risk factors for suivival were analyzed by Cox regression model. Results Totally 47 PKD patients were enrolled,including 33 patients in PKD-PD group and 14 patients in PKD-HD group,and 42 non-PKD patients as the control group.The average age of PKD patients was(53+-11)years,of which 38.3% were women.When compared with PKD-HD group,no significant difference in age,gender,comorbidities,kidney size,and residual glomerular filtration rate were observed in PKD-PD patients at baseline(all P>0.05).The average time on dialysis of PKD-PD patients was(36.2+-33.1)months.The weekly urea clearance index(Kt/V)and weekly creatinine clearance were similar to non-PKD-PD group at 3 months,1 year,3 years,and 5 years(all P>0.05).The peritonitis rate was 1 episode/84.5 months.The survival rates at 1 year,3 years,and 5 years of PKD-PD group were 85.7%,78.6%,and 78.6%,which were similar to non-PKD-PD group and PKD-HD group respectively(all P>0.05).Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that neither PKD nor PD independently predicted the mortality. Conclusion PD can be an option for ESRD patients with PKD.
35373032	Long-Term Outcomes and Prognostic Factors in Kidney Transplant Recipients with Polycystic Kidney Disease.	Background: Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) accounts for approximately 15% of kidney transplants, but long-term outcomes in patients with PKD who have received a kidney transplant are not well understood. Methods: In primary recipients of kidney transplants at our center (1994-2014), we compared outcomes of underlying PKD (N=619) with other native diseases (non-PKD, N=4312). Potential factors influencing outcomes in PKD were evaluated using Cox proportional-hazards regression and a rigorous multivariable model. Results: Patients with PKD were older and were less likely to be sensitized or to experience delayed graft function (DGF). Over a median follow-up of 5.6 years, 1256 of all recipients experienced death-censored graft failure (DCGF; 115 patients with PKD) and 1617 died (154 patients with PKD). After adjustment for demographic, dialysis, comorbid disease, surgical, and immunologic variables, patients with PKD had a lower risk of DCGF (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.73; 95% CI, 0.57 to 0.93; P=0.01) and death (aHR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.75; P<0.001). In our multiadjusted model, calcineurin-inhibitor (CNI) use was associated with lower risk of DCGF (aHR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.26 to 0.76; P=0.003), whereas HLA mismatch of five to six antigens (aHR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.2 to 3.64; P=0.009) was associated with higher likelihood of DCGF. Notably, both pretransplant coronary artery disease (CAD) and higher BMI were associated with increased risk of death (CAD, aHR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.69 to 3.71; P<0.001; per 1 kg/m2 higher BMI, aHR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.11; P<0.001), DCGF, and acute rejection. Nephrectomy at time of transplant and polycystic liver disease were not associated with DCGF/death. Incidence of post-transplant diabetes mellitus was similar between PKD and non-PKD cohorts. Conclusions: Recipients with PKD have better long-term graft and patient survival than those with non-PKD. Standard practices of CNI use and promoting HLA match are beneficial in PKD and should continue to be promoted. Further prospective studies investigating the potential benefits of CNI use and medical/surgical interventions to address CAD and the immunologic challenges of obesity are needed.

29292685	Long-Term Outcomes of Renal Transplant in Recipients With Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction.	OBJECTIVES: Lower urinary tract dysfunction can lead to chronic kidney disease, which, despite surgical intervention, will progress to end-stage renal disease, requiring dialysis. Urologic pathology may damage a transplanted kidney, limiting patient and graft survival. Although smaller studies have suggested that urinary tract dysfunction does not affect graft or patient survival, this is not universally accepted. Northern Ireland has historically had the highest incidence of neural tube defects in Europe, giving rich local experience in caring for patients with lower urinary tract dysfunction. Here, we analyzed outcomes of renal transplant recipients with lower urinary tract dysfunction versus control recipients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified 3 groups of kidney transplant recipients treated between 2001 and 2010; those in group 1 had end-stage renal disease due to lower urinary tract dysfunction with prior intervention (urologic surgery, long-term catheter, or intermittent self-catheterization), group 2 had end-stage renal disease secondary to lower urinary tract dysfunction without intervention, and group 3 had end-stage renal disease due to polycystic kidney disease (chosen as a relatively healthy control cohort without comorbid burden of other causes of end-stage renal disease such as diabetes). The primary outcome measured, graft survival, was death censored, with graft loss defined as requirement for renal replacement therapy or retransplant. Secondary outcomes included patient survival and graft function. RESULTS: In 150 study patients (16 patients in group 1, 64 in group 2, and 70 in group 3), 5-year death-censored graft survival was 93.75%, 90.6%, and 92.9%, respectively, with no significant differences in graft failure among groups (Cox proportional hazards model). Five-year patient survival was 100%, 100%, and 94.3%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with a history of lower urinary tract dysfunction had graft and patient survival rates similar to the control group. When appropriately treated, lower urinary tract dysfunction is not a barrier to successful renal transplant.
26262506	Live Donor Renal Transplant With Simultaneous Bilateral Nephrectomy for Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease Is Feasible and Satisfactory at Long-term Follow-up.	BACKGROUND: Timing of bilateral nephrectomy (BN) is controversial in patients with refractory symptoms of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (APKD) in need of a renal transplant. METHODS: Adults who underwent live donor renal transplant (LRT) + simultaneous BN (SBN) from August 2003 to 2013 at a single transplant center (n = 66) were retrospectively compared to a matched group of APKD patients who underwent LRT alone (n = 52). All patients received general health and polycystic kidney symptom surveys. RESULTS: Simultaneous BN increased operative duration, estimated blood loss, transfusions, intravenous fluid, and hospital length of stay. Most common indications for BN were pain, loss of abdominal domain, and early satiety. There were more intraoperative complications for LRT + SBN (6 vs 0, P = 0.03; 2 vascular, 2 splenic, and 1 liver injury; 1 reexploration to adjust graft positioning). There were no differences in Clavien-Dindo grade I or II (39% vs 25%, P = 0.12) or grade III or IV (7.5% vs 5.7%, P = 1.0) complications during the hospital course. There were no surgery-related mortalities. There were no differences in readmission rates (68% vs 48%, P = 0.19) or readmissions requiring procedures (25% vs. 20%, P = 0.51) over 12 months. One hundred percent of LRT + SBN allografts functioned at longer than 1 year for those available for follow-up. Survey response rate was 40% for LRT-alone and 56% for LRT + SBN. One hundred percent of LRT + SBN survey responders were satisfied with their choice of having BN done simultaneously. CONCLUSIONS: Excellent outcomes for graft survival, satisfaction, and morbidity suggest that the combined operative approach be preferred for patients with symptomatic APKD to avoid multiple procedures, dialysis, and costs of staged operations.
26086830	Bilateral Nephrectomy for Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease and Timing of Kidney Transplant: A Review of the Technical Advances in Surgical Management of Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Disease.	Autosomal dominant polycystic disease is a multisystem inherited condition affecting the kidneys and is an important cause of end-stage renal disease. Patients with autosomal dominant polycystic disease experience symptoms related to size and cystic nature of their kidneys, which can be difficult to manage. Traditionally, the only surgical option for management was open bilateral/unilateral native nephrectomy, which carried with it significant morbidity and mortality. Therefore, it was deemed unsafe and rarely performed. However, surgery for autosomal dominant polycystic disease has evolved rapidly with the advent of minimally invasive surgery and improved medical management of end-stage renal failure patients. Laparoscopic and hand-assisted laparoscopic techniques have been adopted and have demonstrated reduced morbidity. The timing of this intervention in relation to transplant is controversial and presents a major challenge in managing this patient population. 
34412165	Risk factors and outcomes of post-transplant erythrocytosis among adult kidney transplant recipients: a systematic review and meta-analysis.	Post-transplant erythrocytosis (PTE) can occur in up to 10-16% after kidney transplant (KT). However, the post-transplant outcomes of recipients with PTE in the literature were conflicting. We performed systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies to evaluate risk factors of PTE as well as outcomes of recipients who developed PTE compared with controls. A literature search was conducted evaluating all literature from existence through February 2, 2021, using MEDLINE and EMBASE. Data from each study were combined using the random-effects model. (PROSPERO: CRD42021230377). Thirty-nine studies from July 1982 to January 2021 were included (7,099 KT recipients). The following factors were associated with PTE development: male gender (pooled RR = 1.62 [1.38, 1.91], I2  = 39%), deceased-donor KT (pooled RR = 1.18 [1.03, 1.35], I2  = 32%), history of smoking (pooled RR = 1.36 [1.11, 1.67], I2  = 13%), underlying polycystic kidney disease (PKD) (pooled RR=1.56 [1.21, 2.01], I2 =44%), and pretransplant dialysis (pooled RR=1.6 [1.02, 2.51], I2 =46%). However, PTE was not associated with outcomes of interest, including overall mortality, death-censored graft failure, and thromboembolism. Our meta-analysis demonstrates that male gender, deceased-donor KT, history of smoking, underlying PKD, and pretransplant dialysis were significantly associated with developing PTE. However, with proper management, PTE has no impact on prognosis of KT patients.
27665410	[Polycystic kidney disease and kidney transplantation].	"OBJECTIVES: To perform a state of the art about autosomal dominant polykystic kidney disease (ADPKD), management of its urological complications and end stage renal disease treatment modalities. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An exhaustive systematic review of the scientific literature was performed in the Medline database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and Embase (http://www.embase.com) using different associations of the following keywords (MESH): ""autosomal dominant polykystic kidney disease"", ""complications"", ""native nephrectomy"", ""kidney transplantation"". Publications obtained were selected based on methodology, language, date of publication (last 10 years) and relevance. Prospective and retrospective studies, in English or French, review articles; meta-analysis and guidelines were selected and analyzed. This search found 3779 articles. After reading titles and abstracts, 52 were included in the text, based on their relevance. RESULTS: ADPKD is the most inherited renal disease, leading to end stage renal disease requiring dialysis or renal transplantation in about 50% of the patients. Many urological complications (gross hematuria, cysts infection, renal pain, lithiasis) of ADPKD required urological management. The pretransplant evaluation will ask the challenging question of native nephrectomy only in case of recurrent kidney complications or large kidney not allowing graft implantation. The optimum timing for native nephrectomy will depend on many factors (dialysis or preemptive transplantation, complication severity, anuria, easy access to transplantation, potential living donor). CONCLUSION: Pretransplant management of ADPKD is challenging. A conservative strategy should be promoted to avoid anuria (and its metabolic complications) and to preserve a functioning low urinary tract and quality of life. When native nephrectomy should be performed, surgery remains the gold standard but renal arterial embolization may be a safe option due to its low morbidity."
31027891	Value of renal gene panel diagnostics in adults waiting for kidney transplantation due to undetermined end-stage renal disease.	End-stage renal disease (ESRD) of undetermined etiology is highly prevalent and constitutes a significant clinical challenge, particularly in the context of kidney transplantation (KT). Despite the identification of numerous rare hereditary nephropathies over the last few decades, patients with undetermined ESRD are not being systematically investigated for rare genetic causes in clinical practice. To address this, we utilized mutation analysis in patients on the kidney transplant waitlist and scrutinized underlying renal diagnoses of 142 patients in a single center KT-waitlist. This cohort was stratified into 85 cases of determined and 57 cases of undetermined ESRD. The latter patients were analyzed by a renal gene panel for mutations in 209 genes associated with ESRD. The most likely genetic diagnoses in 12% of the tested individuals with undetermined ESRD were established. All of these patients showed mutations in genes encoding components of the glomerular filtration barrier. Taken together, hereditary nephropathies, including autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, were identified in 35 of the 142 patients of the waitlist cohort. By significantly increasing the proportion of hereditary diagnoses from 29 to 35 patients, the rate of undetermined ESRD significantly decreased from 57 to 51 patients. This study demonstrates the beneficial use of genetic diagnostics in significantly unraveling undetermined ESRD cases prior to KT. Thus, in the absence of renal histology or the presence of unspecific histological conditions, such as hypertensive nephrosclerosis, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis or thrombotic microangiopathy, genetic analysis may provide a robust and specific renal diagnosis and allow for optimizing pre- and post-KT management.
26971055	Spontaneous coronary artery dissection in a patient with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease: a case report.	BACKGROUND: Spontaneous coronary artery dissection is an uncommon syndrome. Its prevalence among patients with polycystic kidney disease is very rare, with no previously reported involvement of the right posterior descending coronary artery. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the case of a middle-aged Caucasian woman with polycystic kidney disease who presented with a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. Cardiac catheterization revealed a dissection of her right posterior descending coronary artery. She was treated with dual antiplatelet therapy and had a favorable outcome. CONCLUSION: We report a rare and interesting case of spontaneous coronary artery dissection of the right posterior descending coronary artery in a patient with polycystic kidney disease. It is important to consider spontaneous coronary artery dissection in the differential diagnosis of patients with polycystic kidney disease who present with an acute coronary syndrome.

39072517	Graft Kidney Artery Stenosis in Deceased Donor Kidney Transplant Recipient With Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease: A Case Report.	Here, we report a rare case of transplant renal artery stenosis in a patient with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease who received a kidney from a deceased donor. The transplant renal artery stenosis was caused by the rotation and compression of the transplanted kidney, a consequence of the preexisting polycystic kidney. To address the transplant renal artery stenosis, the patient underwent additional surgical removal of the native polycystic kidney, which corrected the stenosis and restored the function of the transplanted kidney. This case highlighted the importance of monitoring for various causes of renal artery stenosis following kidney transplant.
30927425	Factors influencing the clinical outcome of preimplantation genetic testing for polycystic kidney disease.	STUDY QUESTION: What are the factors influencing the success rate for couples undergoing preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) for polycystic kidney disease (PKD)? SUMMARY ANSWER: In our study cohort, the live birth delivery rate is significantly associated with female age while the male infertility accompanying autosomal dominant PKD (ADPKD) does not substantially affect the clinical outcome. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: While women with ADPKD have no specific fertility problems, male ADPKD patients may present with reproductive system abnormalities and infertility. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This retrospective cohort study involves 91 PGT cycles for PKD for 43 couples (33 couples for PKD1, 2 couples for PKD2 and 8 couples for autosomal recessive PKD (ARPKD)) from January 2005 until December 2016 with follow-up of transfers until end of 2017. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Sixteen single-cell clinical tests for PKD based on multiplex PCR of short tandem repeat markers, with or without a specific mutation were developed and applied for diagnosis of 584 Day 3 cleavage stage embryos. In 18 couples, the male partner was affected with ADPKD (=Group A) and 12 of them had a documented infertility status. Group A underwent 52 cycles to oocyte retrieval. For 18 other couples, the female partner was affected with ADPKD (=Group B) and four male partners from this group had a documented history of infertility. This group underwent 31 cycles to OR. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Genetic analysis resulted in 545 embryos (93.3%) with a diagnosis, of which 215 (36.8%) were genetically transferable. Transfer of 74 embryos in 53 fresh cycles and of 34 cryopreserved embryos in 33 frozen-warmed embryo transfer cycles resulted in a live birth delivery rate of 38.4% per transfer with 31 singleton live births, two twin live births and one ongoing pregnancy. The observed cumulative delivery rate was 57.8% per couple after five treatment cycles. Thirty cryopreserved embryos still remain available for transfer. The clinical pregnancy rate per transfer (fresh + frozen; 45.9% in group A versus 60.0% in group B, P < 0.05) and the live birth delivery rate per transfer (fresh + frozen; 27.0% in group A versus 42.9% in group B, P < 0.05) was significantly lower for couples with the male partner affected with ADPKD compared with couples with the female partner affected with ADPKD. However, a multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that only female age was associated with live birth delivery rate (odds ratio = 0.87; 95% CI: 0.77-0.99; P = 0.032). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: This study is based on retrospective data from a single centre with Day 3 one-cell and two-cell biopsy. Further analysis of a larger cohort of PKD patients undergoing PGT is required to determine the impact of male infertility associated with ADPKD on the cumulative results. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Knowledge about factors affecting the clinical outcome after PGT can be a valuable tool for physicians to counsel PKD patients about their reproductive options. Males affected with ADPKD who suffer from infertility should be advised to seek treatment in time to improve their chances of conceiving a child. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): No funding was obtained. There are no competing interests to declare. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: Not applicable.
37632393	Calcutta position: A new modified supine decubitus for supine PCNL.	INTRODUCTION: PCNL (percutaneous nephrolithotripsy) is considered the gold standard treatment for renal stone more than 2 cm. In today's scenario, supine PCNL is considered equally effective as prone PCNL. The ideal position for supine PCNL is still debatable. We hereby describe our initial experiences of supine PCNL in a novel position. METHODS AND MATERIALS: This prospective study includes 60 patients who underwent supine PCNL in the 'Calcutta position' in our institute from August 2021 to August 2022. Successful procedure was defined as a complete stone free rate or a clinically insignificant residual stone (<4 mm). RESULTS: Average Operative room (OR) occupancy time was 130.9 +- 19.63 min. The immediate stone free rate was 84.2%, 71.4% and 37.5% for single, multiple and staghorn calculus respectively. Complications include fever, requirement of blood transfusions and renal colic. The average hospital stay was 83.6 +- 17.42 h. Eight patients (13.3%) required secondary procedures like extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) or relook PCNL. At 3 months average stone free rates were 92%, 85%, 75% for single, multiple and staghorn calculus respectively. We performed supine PCNL in Calcutta position in obese, kyphoscoliosis, poliomyelitis, autosomal polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), malrotated kidney and diverticular stone with comparable success. CONCLUSION: Supine PCNL in Calcutta position is a safe and effective option for nephrolithiasis management. Apart from the inherent advantages of supine PCNL it also has the advantages of better C-Arm and nephroscope manoeuvrability. Supine PCNL in Calcutta position was performed in a variety of scenarios with comparable results.
35636836	Safety of High-Dose 3% Sodium Tetradecyl Sulfate for Sclerotherapy of Renal Cysts in Patients with Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease.	This study assessed the safety profile of high-volume (>10 mL) 3% sodium tetradecyl sulfate (STS) sclerotherapy for the treatment of renal cysts in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. A total of 211 sclerotherapy treatments were performed in 169 patients over a 5-year period, with a comparison of 2 patient cohorts based on the STS volumes used. The first cohort (n = 112) received a high volume (greater than 10 mL) of STS, and the second cohort (n = 57) received a low volume (less than 10 mL). The minor adverse event rate for the cohorts was 14.5% and 9.6%, respectively (P = .310), with postprocedure pain being the most common event. One major adverse event occurred, for which the patient required hospitalization for infection after low-volume STS treatment. Doses of STS higher than those currently recommended by the Food and Drug Administration for intravascular use allow large renal cysts to be treated safely in the setting of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.
36930253	The impact of pre-transplantation nephrectomy on quality of life in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.	PURPOSE: In selected ADPKD patients, a nephrectomy is required in the work-up for a kidney transplantation. Because the impact of this procedure is unknown, we investigated the effect of pre-transplantation nephrectomy on quality of life in this group. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study all ADPKD patients, >= 18 years, who received a kidney transplantation in 2 ADPKD expertise centers between January 2000 and January 2016, were asked to participate. Quality of life was assessed using three validated questionnaires on three time points. Nephrectomy was performed in preparation for transplantation. RESULTS: Two hundred seventy-six ADPKD patients (53 +- 9 years, 56.2% male) were included. 98 patients (35.5%) underwent native nephrectomy in preparation for transplantation, of which 43 underwent bilateral nephrectomy. Pre-transplantation, ADPKD-IS scores were worse in the nephrectomy group vs. no-nephrectomy group (physical: 2.9 vs. 2.3, p < 0.001; emotional: 2.0 vs. 1.8, p = 0.03; fatigue: 3.0 vs. 2.3, p = 0.01). Post-transplantation and post-nephrectomy, ADPKD-IS scores improved significantly in both groups, with a significantly higher improvement in the nephrectomy group. During follow-up, all scores were still better compared to pre-transplantation. Observed physical QoL (ADPKD-IS physical 1.3 vs. 1.7, p = 0.04; SF-36 physical 50.0 vs. 41.3, p = 0.03) was better post-transplantation after bilateral nephrectomy compared to unilateral nephrectomy. In retrospect, 19.7% of patients would have liked to undergo a nephrectomy, while the decision not to perform nephrectomy was made by the treating physician. CONCLUSION: This study shows that pre-transplantation nephrectomy improves quality of life in selected ADPKD patients. Bilateral nephrectomy may be preferred, although the risk of additional complications should be weighted.
34261447	What are the information needs and concerns of individuals with Polycystic Kidney Disease? Results of an online survey using Facebook and social listening analysis.	BACKGROUND: Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD) is a hereditary disorder that has no cure and can result in end stage kidney failure. Searching for health information online and via social media is a common phenomenon in many medical conditions. However, no recent studies have documented the information needs, online behaviours, and concerns of people with PKD. The aim of this study was to explore the information needs of individuals with PKD and their carers by documenting (i) the information needs (ii) online information health seeking behaviours (iii) the perceived challenges of living with PKD and (iv) dietary concerns. METHODS: A 17-item survey was constructed by undertaking a social listening analysis. This survey was then distributed via PKD related social media groups on Facebook. Seven groups distributed the survey with permission from the group owners. Open free text survey questions were analysed thematically using content analysis. RESULTS: A total of 536 respondents completed the online survey (70.9 % female, 77 % aged 35-70, 70.2 % diagnosed more than 10 years ago). The major information need expressed by participants with PKD was for dietary information. Information regarding medications, medical management and symptom control were also desired. The overarching themes arising from the free text responses to the major challenge of living with PKD included 'learning to navigate dietary ambiguities'; 'managing social, psychological and emotional needs'; and 'accepting an uncertain future'. In addition to a strong desire for practical and specific dietary information, participants expressed a need for more online information pertaining to management of fatigue, pain, complications and how to manage mental health. Online peer support was also highly regarded and desired. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides contemporary insights into the type of information desired by people with PKD. The results indicated that there was a strong desire for unambiguous information and guidance from health professionals to facilitate self-management, alleviate concerns, and address the complexities of living with Polycystic Kidney Disease. While diet is an important and frequently expressed need, there also remains a large demand for information on how to support psychological needs, and on medical management in order to support treatment decision making. Future work is required to develop specific, actionable and evidence-based resources for patients that are available online and through health professionals. Increased access to renal dietitians, peer support and additional training for health professionals could also improve patient-centered care and support self-management.
29136299	Malignancy in Renal Transplant Recipients Exposed to Cyclophosphamide Prior to Transplantation for the Treatment of Native Glomerular Disease.	STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the risk of posttransplantation malignancy in renal transplant recipients exposed to pretransplantation cyclophosphamide for the treatment of glomerular nephropathy (GN). DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Tertiary academic medical center. PATIENTS: Six hundred adult renal transplant recipients were transplanted between 1993 and 2014; 54 patients were exposed to pretransplantation cyclophosphamide for treatment of GN (GN-CYC group), and 546 patients with polycystic kidney disease were not exposed to pretransplantation cyclophosphamide (PKD group). MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS: Data were collected retrospectively from electronic medical records. The primary outcome was occurrence of posttransplantation malignancy. During a median follow-up of 5.5 years, 130 patients developed malignancy (incidence rate 3.5 events per 100 person-yrs). Exposure to cyclophosphamide before transplantation was significantly associated with malignancy after transplantation (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 2.20, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.16-4.22, p=0.02), specifically skin cancer (aHR 2.24, 95% CI 1.09-4.60, p=0.03). Malignancy risk in the GN-CYC group was higher in the setting of lymphocyte-depleting induction (alemtuzumab; aHR 4.53, 95% CI 0.99-20.72, p=0.05) compared with basiliximab induction. Incidences of death-censored graft loss and mortality were similar between the GN-CYC and PKD groups. CONCLUSION: In our observational study, renal transplant recipients exposed to pretransplantation cyclophosphamide appeared to have a higher risk of developing a malignancy compared with unexposed renal transplant recipients. Further investigation into the impact of pretransplantation immunosuppression on malignancy, particularly the compounded effect with lymphocyte-depleting induction, is warranted.
31990868	Long-term Outcomes and Health Perceptions in Pediatric-onset Portal Hypertension Complicated by Varices.	OBJECTIVES: Outcomes of pediatric-onset portal hypertension are poorly defined. We aimed to assess population-based long-term outcomes of pediatric-onset portal hypertension complicated by varices. METHODS: All children with esophageal varices (n = 126) were identified from 14,144 single nationwide referral center endoscopy reports during 1987 to 2013, and followed up through national health care and death registers. A questionnaire was sent to survivors (n = 94) of whom 65 (69%) responded. RESULTS: Nineteen underlying disorders included biliary atresia (35%), extrahepatic portal vein obstruction (35%), autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (7%), and other disorders (23%). During median follow-up of 15.2 (range 0.5-43.1) years patients underwent median 9 (1-74) upper gastrointestinal endoscopies. Esophageal varices were first observed at a median age of 4.0 (0.3-18.2) years, 112 (89%) patients underwent median 6 (1-56) sclerotherapy/banding sessions, and 61 (48%) experienced median 2 (range 1-20) variceal bleeding episodes. Forty-eight surgical shunt procedures were performed to 41 (36%) patients and 38% underwent liver transplantation. Portal hypertensive biliopathy was diagnosed in 4 patients. Hepatopulmonary syndrome necessitated liver transplantation in 2 patients, hepatic encephalopathy in 2, and hepatorenal syndrome in 1. No patient died of variceal bleeding. Patient-reported perception of health on a scale of 1 to 10 was 9 (range 4-10), and 86% reported no current symptoms attributable to esophageal varices. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric-onset portal hypertension is a heterogeneous disease with significant long-term morbidity, requiring multimodal approach with considerable resources and continuation of follow-up in adulthood. Although mortality to variceal bleeding was avoided, bleeding episodes recurred also in adulthood, while patient-reported health of long-term survivors was encouraging.
29664556	Clinical problems in hemodialysis patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.	Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a common monogenic disease characterized by massive enlargement of fluid-filled cysts in the kidney. Due to its genetic pattern, the disease differs from other CKD. ADPKD is a multi-system, progressive disorder which is frequently complicated with hypertension, cardiovascular events and cerebrovascular disease. Thus, there are many clinical problems specific to ADPKD. In this article, we reviewed these clinical problems and their management in ADPKD with hemodialysis patients.
32847032	Metabolic Changes in Polycystic Kidney Disease as a Potential Target for Systemic Treatment.	Autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD, ADPKD) are systemic disorders with pronounced hepatorenal phenotypes. While the main underlying genetic causes of both ARPKD and ADPKD have been well-known for years, the exact molecular mechanisms resulting in the observed clinical phenotypes in the different organs, remain incompletely understood. Recent research has identified cellular metabolic changes in PKD. These findings are of major relevance as there may be an immediate translation into clinical trials and potentially clinical practice. Here, we review important results in the field regarding metabolic changes in PKD and their modulation as a potential target of systemic treatment.
26385435	Proposal for an algorithm for liver transplantation in Caroli's disease and syndrome: putting an uncommon effort into a common task.	Liver transplantation (LT) represents an uncommon indication for Caroli's disease (CD) or syndrome (CS). Excellent results of LT have been reported as shown by recent multicentric European and American registry reports. Clear therapeutic flowcharts to adopt in these diseases are still lacking. This review aims at analyzing highlighting recent transplant experiences in this field and also at focusing on the role of LT in case-specific comorbidities such as development of cholangiocellular cancer or renal failure are present. 
25251090	Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.	Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common inherited cause of kidney disease. Enlarging cysts within the kidneys are the clinical hallmark of the disease. Renal manifestations include varying degrees of kidney injury, urinary tract infections, kidney stones, and hematuria. Extrarenal manifestations can include pain, hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, hepatic cysts, intracranial aneurysm, diverticulosis, and abdominal and inguinal hernias. The progression of ADPKD cannot be reversed with current treatment modalities; therefore, therapies target the resulting clinical manifestations. Early detection and management of hypertension are important to delay the progression of renal dysfunction and development of cardiovascular complications. Pain management includes evaluation of concomitant illnesses, use of analgesics, and adjuvant therapy. Fluoroquinolones may be the most useful class of antibiotics for the treatment of urinary tract infections because of their lipophilic properties and bactericidal action against gram-negative pathogens. Nephrolithiasis is twice as common in persons with ADPKD compared with the general population and is suggested by flank pain with or without hematuria. Cystic hemorrhages usually resolve within one week, although microscopic hematuria may still be present. Because of the proliferative effect of estrogen on hepatic cysts, oral contraceptives containing estrogen and menopausal estrogen therapy should be administered at the lowest effective dose or avoided in patients with ADPKD. Intracranial aneurysms are at least twice as common in patients with ADPKD than in the general population. Renal ultrasonography is the diagnostic modality of choice to screen at-risk individuals for ADPKD. 
26245766	Comparative Study of Outcomes among Patients with Polycystic Kidney Disease on Hemodialysis and Peritoneal Dialysis.	Polycystic kidney disease (PCKD) is the most common hereditary cause of end-stage renal disease, the complications of which may prevent the choice of peritoneal dialysis (PD). The aim of this study was to explore the effects of dialysis modality on outcomes in patients with PCKD. We extracted a cohort of 1417 adult patients with PCKD initiating long-term dialysis therapy in 1999-2010 from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, among which 125 patients chose PD. The patients on HD were older and had a higher comorbidity index compared to those on PD. We compared the risks for death, hospitalization and medical expenditures between the patients on PD and propensity-score matched patients on hemodialysis (HD). The overall survival did not differ between the patients on PD and HD. The patients on PD tended to have higher hazard ratios (HR) for the first episode of hospitalization (adjusted HR 1.34 [95% CI, 1.04-1.79]). The annual medical expenses were 10% lower for the patients on PD. PD is an equivalent choice of renal replacement therapy to HD for patients with PCKD in terms of survival. Although the patients on PD had a higher risk for hospitalization, the medical expenditure for PD was 10% lower. 
35980440	Romosozumab successfully regulated progressive osteoporosis in a patient with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease undergoing hemodialysis.	Osteoporosis is a crucial complication in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), similar to that in the general population. Although romosozumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting sclerostin, has been administered for patients with CKD, its clinical effectiveness in these patients, especially in patients on hemodialysis (HD), remains to be studied. Herein, we report the case of a 42-year-old man on HD who developed severe osteoporosis. Serum calcium levels were extremely high, bone metabolic markers were abnormal, and the patient had pathological fractures. The bone biopsy indicated a bone metabolism disorder and high bone turnover. We administered romosozumab once a month as an intervention for bone alteration. Through the 10-month usage, bone metabolic markers improved, and the decrease in bone mineral density was ameliorated. We hypothesized that romosozumab could be a therapeutic option for osteoporosis in patients undergoing HD, especially in those with bone mineralization disorders.
26328773	Therapeutic targets for polycystic kidney disease.	INTRODUCTION: Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a common genetic disease in which renal enlargement and loss of function is caused by progressive expansion of tubular cysts. To reverse the detrimental effects of PKD gene mutation(s) and to slow cystic expansion, new drug therapies are required. AREAS COVERED: The underlying cell biology leading to identification of molecular targets for PKD is reviewed. Specific focus is on studies published at the early pre-clinical level. These include genetic and epigenetic modulators, and drugs to slow cystic expansion and disease progression. Discussion of specific drugs and clinical trials is not within the scope of this article. Literature research methods included EndNote and PubMed online searches using keyword combinations: polycystic kidneys disease, pre-clinical, molecular targets, signal transduction, genetic modulators, epigenetic, therapeutic, receptors, kinases. Where possible, the most recent citations concerning a given target are referenced. EXPERT OPINION: It is suggested that the most promising targets for future therapeutic development are those that target upstream signaling events at cell membranes, such as the vasopressin-2 receptor (AVPR2), EGFR/ErbB2, and the beta-1-integrin receptor, as well as the intracellular integrator kinase, c-Src.
25115876	Transplantation in autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease: liver and/or kidney?	Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) is characterized by enlarged kidneys with dilated collecting ducts and congenital hepatic fibrosis. There is a variable rate of progression of kidney and liver disease. Portal hypertension and Caroli's disease occur from liver involvement that contributes to morbidity and mortality. Approximately 40 % of patients have a severe disease phenotype leading to rapid onset of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and signs of portal hypertension and the rest may have predominant involvement of either the kidney or liver. It is important for the physician to establish the extent of organ involvement before deciding on the ultimate plan of management, especially when transplantation is required. Isolated renal transplantation can be considered when liver involvement is minimal. If hepatobiliary disease is prominent, and kidney function is preserved, management options are based on individual characteristics. In the presence of significant liver disease and ESKD, consideration should be given to combined liver kidney transplantation, which can be beneficial in eliminating the consequences of both kidney and liver disease. However, this is a complex surgical procedure that needs to be performed at experienced transplant centers. Improvement in surgical techniques has considerably improved short-term graft survival with the added advantage of the liver offering immunologic protection to the kidney allograft.
35102953	Successful management of multiple obstructing renal calculi in a 30-year-old patient with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease using Frequency-Doubled Double-Pulse neodymium: Yttrium - Aluminium garnet laser lithotripsy.	Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most prevalent genetic disorder that results in end-stage renal disease. Although ADPKD patients experience long disease trajectories, factors such as hypertension, proteinuria and renal calculi have been observed to lead to rapid renal function impairment in patients with ADPKD. Furthermore, due to the distorted anatomy that makes access to stone difficult, the management of nephrolithiasis in ADPKD patients is one of the several special situations in which urinary lithiasis presents management challenges. We report the case of a 30-year-old male with ADPKD and renal function impairment as a result of multiple obstructive calculi who was treated in Dialyser Medical Centre, Oshodi, Lagos, with Frequency-Doubled Double-Pulse Neodymium: Yttrium - Aluminium Garnet laser (FREDDY laser) lithotripsy, highlighting the possible advantage of FREDDY laser over other types of laser procedures given the minimal tissue-damaging potential of the laser type.
25340609	Genetic testing in the assessment of living related kidney donors at risk of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.	"BACKGROUND: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common genetic cause of renal failure. In most patients who develop end-stage renal disease, transplantation is the renal replacement modality of choice. For living related kidney donation (LRKD), the major challenge is to exclude the diagnosis of ADPKD in potential donors. Renal imaging may not exclude ADPKD particularly in younger donors and molecular genetic testing is advised. We report the largest series to date evaluating the role of genetic testing for ADPKD in LRKD assessment. METHODS: A cohort of patients with ADPKD and potential LRKD were referred for genetic testing for ADPKD between April 2010 and October 2012. DNA sequencing of PKD1 and PKD2 was performed. Imaging investigations and transplant outcomes after genetic testing were collected. RESULTS: Nineteen patients and 25 potential LRKD underwent genetic testing. Of potential LRKD, one tested positive for ADPKD and one with a diagnostic ultrasound tested negative. Despite negative genetic testing, two potential LRKD were considered unsuitable because of the detection of stage I (""simple"") renal cysts on computed tomography. Four living related kidney transplants have occurred, and two are planned. Three patients subsequently refused the donation as the potential donor was a child. CONCLUSION: Predictive genetic testing can facilitate donor evaluation and augment living related kidney transplantation in ADPKD. Psychologic challenges associated with accepting an LRKD require careful consideration during recipient assessment. The acceptability of using a kidney with cysts from a mutation-negative donor should be evaluated by a multidisciplinary team."
38384081	Delayed diagnosis of bladder cancer in a patient with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.	ABSTRACT: Approximately 50% of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) patients have gross hematuria, but few cases of bladder cancer complications are known. We report a case of a 49-year-old female ADPKD patient with bladder cancer, who was presented to our hospital 4 months after the onset of gross hematuria. A computed tomography (CT) scan showed a bladder mass, enlarged pelvic and left inguinal lymph nodes, multiple liver cysts, and a polycystic kidney. Based on family history, CT scan results, and lymph node biopsy, we diagnosed the patient with uroplakin III-negative bladder cancer with squamous metaplasia and ADPKD. The patient was treated with systemic chemotherapy but died 2 months after the definitive diagnosis. The delayed diagnosis was disastrous, and malignancy should be considered in the differential diagnosis when symptoms suggestive of malignancy such as hematuria appear. Particularly, uroplakin III-negative advanced bladder cancer has a poor prognosis and requires early diagnosis and treatment.
26270957	Pediatric combined liver-kidney transplantation: a 2015 update.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The experience of combined liver-kidney transplantation (CLKT) is limited in pediatric populations. This strategy is, however, required in specific diseases such as metabolic diseases (namely primary hyperoxaluria type one and methylmalonic acidemia), autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease, miscellaneous ciliopathies and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome. RECENT FINDINGS: Different series and registry studies have confirmed the feasibility of pediatric CLKT with encouraging results in the long term, even in the youngest and smallest patients, provided that highly trained multidisciplinary teams are involved in this global management. As such, the long-term outcomes after CLKT are currently comparable to that of isolated liver or kidney transplantations, even though the immediate postoperative period remains challenging. SUMMARY: Some questions remain nevertheless unanswered, such as the respective place of combined versus sequential liver-kidney transplantation, especially in primary hyperoxaluria and autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease. The aim of this review was therefore to provide a 2015 update on pediatric CLKT. In the future, international collaborative studies and registries may help to improve our knowledge of this rare and still highly challenging technique.
27733241	Chronic kidney disease in the neonate: etiologies, management, and outcomes.	Neonatal chronic kidney disease (CKD) occurs with an estimated incidence of 1 in 10,000 live births, whereas the incidence of neonatal end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is about 7.1 per million age-related population. The most frequent etiologies are renal hypoplasia/dysplasia, posterior urethral valves, and other congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract. Other etiologies include polycystic kidney disease, cortical necrosis, and renal vascular thrombosis. Management of CKD focuses primarily on replacing renal functions such as erythropoietin, 1,25-hydroxylation of vitamin D, electrolyte homeostasis/excretion, and, in ESRD, waste product removal. Nutrition and growth monitoring are of utmost importance, with the majority of ESRD infants requiring gastrostomy tube for nutrition. Outcomes of neonates (<31 days) started on dialysis continue to improve, with large cohort studies showing 2-3-year survival rates of 79-81%. As in other neonatal disciplines, the gestational age and size limits for safe provision of dialysis continue to decrease.
28889140	Multiple bilateral renal abscesses in a previously healthy young patient.	The incidence of renal abscesses is not common. Patients usually have risk factors like diabetes mellitus or an underlying condition which predisposes to urinary tract infections. We report a case of a previously healthy young girl with multiple bilateral renal abscesses. Ultrasonography revealed multiple renal abscesses with a possible differential diagnosis of polycystic kidney disease with infected cysts. No renal calculi were seen. CT-scan of kidneys confirmed the diagnosis. Blood and urine cultures were repeatedly negative. She was treated with two weeks of intravenous antibiotics followed by another four weeks of oral Ciprofloxacin. No surgical intervention was carried out. Repeated ultrasound at six months showed complete resolution of all the renal abscesses.
33064294	Sarcomatoid renal cell carcinoma with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease: a case report and literature review.	Diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is challenging and often delayed due to accompanying multiple renal cysts. Sometimes, it is difficult to distinguish RCC from cyst infection or hemorrhage. We herein present the case of a patient with ADPKD undergoing long-term hemodialysis whose sarcomatoid RCC was difficult to diagnose and was confirmed via nephrectomy. A 53-year-old male, undergoing hemodialysis since 20 years for end-stage renal disease secondary to ADPKD, was admitted to our hospital with a 3-week history of fever at > 38  C and right flank pain. Clinical manifestations were compatible with cyst infection. Magnetic resonance images of the lesion identified in the lower right kidney, revealing slightly high signal intensity on T1-weighted images, low signal intensity on T2 weighted images, and restricted diffusion on diffusion-weighted images, were also consistent with those of cyst infection. Therefore, antibiotic therapy with ciprofloxacin, doripenem, and vancomycin was initiated. However, the patient's symptoms did not improve. Consequently, right nephrectomy was performed for both diagnosis and treatment, which revealed a sarcomatoid RCC with metastasis to the regional lymph node. The patient gradually developed cachexia and died on day 106 post-admission. The present case illustrates the difficulty of diagnosing RCC in patients with ADPKD, particularly sarcomatoid RCC, which is a rare and aggressive variant of RCC, even with the use of various types of imaging modalities. An early decision of nephrectomy may be necessary in such cases.
28494735	Perspectives of Gene Therapies in Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease.	BACKGROUND: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common inherited kidney disease in the clinic. The predominant clinical manifestation is bilateral and progressive cysts formation in the kidneys, impairs normal renal parenchyma, and ultimately leads to endstage renal disease (ESRD). ADPKD is a heterogenic disease which is resulted from the mutations of PKD1 or PKD2 genes which encode polycystin-1 (PC1) and -2 (PC2), thereby multiple cell signaling pathways are involved. METHOD: Although causative genes and aberrant signaling pathways have been investigated for decades, lack of effective and less side-effect treatment for the disease still perplex vast clinicians. Therefore, development of new therapeutic approaches for ADPKD is currently very much desired. CONCLUSION: This review will center on pathogenesis of ADPKD, and thereafter gene transfer will be discussed as potential treatment for the disease. New therapeutic interventions will bring further hope to improve prognosis of this incurable disease.
30603000	Clinical presentation and outcome of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease in Nigeria.	INTRODUCTION: Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) is presumably rare in Africa. Knowledge about the disease in Nigeria is limited as demonstrated by scanty articles on the subject. OBJECTIVES: To determine the pattern of clinical presentation and outcome of ADPKD among ADPKD patients. METHOD: ADPKD subjects were prospectively studied between January 1996 and December 2010. Their demographics, clinical and investigation parameters were documented. Dependency on dialysis, renal transplant and death were the final outcomes. RESULTS: Forty one patients (M:F=1.3:1) with mean age of 48.6+-4.6 years were studied. ADPKD was diagnosed at 2.73 cases per annum. Family history of ADPKD and hypertension were present in 56.1% and 82.9% respectively. Their mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 166.9 +-23.6 and 104 +-21.2 respectively.Nocturia (78.0%) and loin pain (68.3%) were the most common presenting symptoms. Liver cysts (31.7%) and aortic regurgitation (22.0%) were the predominant extra-renal manifestations.Twenty three (56.1%) received haemodialysis; no renal transplantation. Death rate was 51.2%. Presence of uraemia and intra-cerebral aneurysm contributed significantly to mortality. CONCLUSION: ADPKD may not be so rare in Nigeria. Awareness campaign to change attitude of family members to screening and further studies using newer criteria for diagnosis of ADPKD should be conducted.
35592729	Patient Selection for Renal Denervation in Hypertensive Patients: What Makes a Good Candidate?	Renal denervation (RDN) as a therapeutic intervention in patients with hypertension has been intensively studied for over a decade, yet a critical question remains unanswered: what kind of patients are the ideal target population for RDN to achieve its maximum clinical benefit? We herein provide a review of current literature to answer questions related to patient selection to identify populations that will benefit most from RDN, drawing first from human studies but also important clues derived from preclinical animal models. Different aspects that may influence the selection of patients such as the cause of hypertension, the severity of hypertension, concurrent pharmaceutical treatment, renal function, and renal artery anatomy are discussed. Based on current evidence, patients who have severe primary hypertension, regardless of medication or degree of renal dysfunction, who have an accessible accessory renal artery, can achieve a desirable response if a thorough ablation is achieved. In preclinical models, as in humans, RDN shows variable impact, with evidence indicating it does not work in specific conditions such as reduced renal mass, salt-sensitive hypertension, and autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease. The thresholds, however, for indicators are such that it is still not possible to reliably predict which patients could benefit from the technique. Confirmation of predictive factors and identification of biomarkers are needed before RDN can be integrated in clinical practice on clear and reliable grounds.
34138451	A case of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease with amelioration of refractory cyst infections following prolonged hemodialysis time.	Renal cyst infection is a frequent and serious problem in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Cyst infection is often a refractory complication of treatment that leads to sepsis and death in patients with ADPKD. It was previously reported that a higher dose of dialysis demonstrated clearly better survival than shorten-time dialysis. The relationship between the frequency of cyst infection episodes in hemodialysis (HD) patients with ADPKD and the dialysis dose has not yet been fully elucidated. In this report, we describe a case of an HD patient with ADPKD that was provided elongation of HD time from 4-h twice weekly HD to 8-h thrice weekly nocturnal HD. As a result, the frequency of cyst infection episodes decreased from 10.0 to 1.5 days a month. Our findings suggest that prolonged HD time might contribute to amelioration of refractory cyst infections in patients with ADPKD.
39203719	Potential Add-On Benefits of Dietary Intervention in the Treatment of Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease.	Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common inherited cause of renal failure. The pathogenesis of the disease encompasses several pathways and metabolic alterations, including the hyperactivation of mTOR and suppression of AMPK signaling pathways, as well as mitochondrial dysfunction. This metabolic reprogramming makes epithelial cyst-lining cells highly dependent on glucose for energy and unable to oxidize fatty acids. Evidence suggests that high-carbohydrate diets may worsen the progression of ADPKD, providing the rationale for treating ADPKD patients with calorie restriction and, in particular, with ketogenic dietary interventions, already used for other purposes such as in overweight/obese patients or in the treatment of refractory epilepsy in children. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that calorie restriction may prevent and/or slow disease progression by inducing ketosis, particularly through increased beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) levels, which may modulate the metabolic signaling pathways altered in ADKPK. In these patients, although limited, ketogenic intervention studies have shown promising beneficial effects. However, larger and longer randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm their tolerability and safety in long-term maintenance and their additive role in the therapy of polycystic kidney disease.
24861687	[Laparoscopic nephrectomy for polycystic kidneys: principles and results].	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility and morbidity of laparoscopic nephrectomy in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPK). PATIENTS AND METHOD: This is a retrospective multi-centre study (University Hospitals of Lyons, Toulouse, Nantes and Rennes). Sixty-eight patients who had undergone laparoscopic nephrectomy for polycystic kidney disease between November 1999 and May 2009 were included. This involved unilateral nephrectomy 64 cases, one-stage bilateral in one case and two-stage bilateral in three cases. RESULTS: The mean operating time was 218+-74min (100-420) Conversion was necessary in 7 cases. The mean weight of the removed kidney was 1291+-646g (240-3400). We regret to report 20 postoperative complications, including one death on postoperative day 50, following an abscess in the renal pelvis, 6 retroperitoneal haemoatomas and 5 arteriovenous fistula thromboses. Postoperative analgesia involved PCA treatment with morphine for a mean period of 1.59+-0.8 days (0.5-4). The mean length of hospital stay was 8.3+-6.1 days (3-50). CONCLUSION: This study shows the feasibility of the laparoscopic approach for nephrectomy in ADPK. This procedure should be performed by experienced laparoscopic surgeons. Indeed, the complication rate is moderate but there is still a risk of severe complications. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 5.
38097334	Dialysis and Transplant Considerations in Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease.	Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the fourth leading cause of kidney replacement therapy. Unfortunately, the need for dialysis or kidney transplantation is a foreseeable outcome for many patients affected by ADPKD. We review some of the unique issues that should be considered in the management of patients with ADPKD who require dialysis or kidney transplantation. The choice of dialysis modality may be influenced by the enlarged kidneys and liver, but peritoneal dialysis should not be excluded as an option, as studies do not consistently show that there is an increased risk for technique failure or peritonitis. The optimal kidney replacement therapy option remains kidney transplantation; however, nephrectomy may be needed if there is insufficient space for the allograft. Living donor candidates from at-risk families need to be excluded from carrying the disease either by diagnostic imaging criteria or genetic testing. Other potential transplant issues, such as malignancy and cardiovascular and metabolic risks, should also be recognized. Despite these issues, patients with ADPKD requiring dialysis or kidney transplantation generally have more favorable outcomes as compared to those with other causes of chronic kidney disease. Further studies are still needed to personalize the therapeutic approach for those receiving kidney replacement therapy and eventually improve clinical outcomes.
35470481	Hand-assisted laparoscopic bilateral native nephrectomy for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease post-renal transplant.	
28597060	[Early bilateral nephrectomy in neonatal autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease : Improved prognosis or unnecessary effort?]	BACKGROUND: Neonatal autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) is associated with giant kidneys, lung hypoplasia, pulmonal hypertension, and end-stage renal failure. Depending on the study, mortality is reported to range between 20 and 80%. OBJECTIVES: Does bilateral nephrectomy improve survival? PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2010 and 2016, we treated 7 children with prenatally diagnosed ARPKD. All had a planned delivery by cesarean section. After birth, oscillated ventilation with nitrogen enrichment was initiated to achieve maximum oxygenation and to decrease pumonary hypertension. All children had bilateral massive kidney hyperplasia (length 13-16 cm). RESULTS: Nephrectomy on one side was performed within 72 h together with placement of a peritoneal dialysis catheter in the intensive care unit. Contralateral nephrectomy was performed after 1-2 weeks when the child was stabilized by dialysis. In 2 children, kidney transplantation has already been performed and they are doing fine. One child died after 10 months due to infection. The other children are stable on home peritoneal dialysis awaiting transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Early bilateral nephrectomy in neonatal ARPKD is feasible, but requires distinctive care at a pediatric intensive care unit and a high amount of organizational efforts to treat these children adequately in the first few days. In our experience, the procedure is a promising approach to improve ventilation and enable dialysis. However, kidney transplantation, best from a living donor, is required within the first years of life.
32336652	Effectiveness of Nephrectomy and Transcatheter Arterial Embolization Before Kidney Transplantation in Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease.	BACKGROUND: Renal transplantation in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) remains a feasible option because no recurrence has been reported. Transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) for patients with ADPKD is performed to control infection, pain, or bleeding and can help reduce kidney volume. However, nephrectomy may be needed for inadequate kidney shrinkage. The effects of these procedures performed before transplantation on transplant outcomes or kidney functions are not discussed. We retrospectively evaluated the effectiveness of nephrectomy and TAE before transplantation. METHODS: Forty-four patients who underwent renal transplantation in our center between 2008 and 2018 were classified into 4 groups according to whether nephrectomy or TAE was performed. We collected information on sex, age, type of transplantation, history of nephrectomy or TAE, renal function, postoperative complications, graft acceptance, and survival rates. RESULTS: Of the 17 patients who underwent TAE and those who did not, 8 and 7 underwent nephrectomy, respectively; 16 underwent bilateral TAE and primitive transplantation. The patients who underwent both nephrectomy and TAE had significantly better kidney function than those who underwent neither. With TAE alone, without nephrectomy, the mean volume reduction rate was 23.5% and 28.4% on the left and right, respectively; in patients who underwent neither procedure, the mean volume reduction rates were 24.8% and 28.4%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who underwent both nephrectomy and TAE had better renal function than those in any other group. However, if the recipient's pelvis has sufficient space, nephrectomy is unnecessary because the kidney volume decreases after transplantation by approximately 25%.
25165191	Spanish guidelines for the management of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.	Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most frequent cause of genetic renal disease and accounts for 6-10% of patients on renal replacement therapy (RRT). Very few prospective, randomized trials or clinical studies address the diagnosis and management of this relatively frequent disorder. No clinical guidelines are available to date. This is a consensus statement presenting the recommendations of the Spanish Working Group on Inherited Kidney Diseases, which were agreed to following a literature search and discussions. Levels of evidence found were C and D according to the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (University of Oxford). The recommendations relate to, among other topics, the use of imaging and genetic diagnosis, management of hypertension, pain, cyst infections and bleeding, extra-renal involvement including polycystic liver disease and cranial aneurysms, management of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and RRT and management of children with ADPKD. Recommendations on specific ADPKD therapies are not provided since no drug has regulatory approval for this indication. 
34665698	Long-term survival of renal transplantation in patients with lupus nephritis: experience from a single university centre.	OBJECTIVES: Lupus nephritis (LN) is a severe complication of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Unfortunately, 10-20% of patients with LN develop end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and renal transplantation may be a therapeutic option. However, concerns about LN recurrence after transplant have been reported. We aimed to assess long-term post-transplant graft and patient survival in LN compared to patients with non-autoimmune nephropathy (polycystic kidney disease - PCKD). METHODS: We carried out a single-centre retrospective study of all patients who underwent renal transplantation due to LN in a referral unit between 1980 and 2018. This cohort was compared with a group of PCKD patients. The main outcome variables were graft and patient survival for up to 20 years, and the time-course of serum creatinine and proteinuria in the first 5 years after transplantation. Cumulative survival rates were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. RESULTS: We included 53 patients: LN group (n=21) and PCKD group (n=32). Baseline clinical characteristics were similar in both groups, except age at transplantation (39.8+-11.3 years in the LN group and 46.6+-5.0 years in the PCKD group; p=0.004). No significant differences were found regarding graft (p=0.59) or patient survival (p=0.087) at 20 years of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Despite concerns about LN recurrence after renal transplantation, this study shows that this procedure might be a safe alternative therapy for ESRD related to SLE and may provide long-term survival.

28535817	Safety and tolerability of autologous bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells in ADPKD patients.	BACKGROUND: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a genetic ciliopathy disease characterized by progressive formation and enlargement of cysts in multiple organs. The kidneys are particularly affected and patients may eventually develop end-stage renal disease (ESRD). We hypothesize that bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BMMSCs) are renotropic and may improve kidney function via anti-apoptotic, anti-fibrotic, and anti-inflammatory effects. In this study, we aim to assess the safety and tolerability of a BMMSC infusion in ADPKD patients. METHODS: We performed a single-arm phase I clinical trial with a 12-month follow-up. This study enrolled six eligible ADPKD patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 25-60 ml/min/1.73 m2. Patients received autologous cultured BMMSCs (2 x 106 cells/kg) through the cubital vein according to our infusion protocol. We investigated safety issues and kidney function during the follow-up visits, and compared the findings to baseline and 1 year prior to the intervention. RESULTS: There were no patients lost to follow-up. We observed no cell-related adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE) after 12 months of follow-up. The mean eGFR value of 33.8 +- 5.3 ml/min/1.73 m2 1 year before cell infusion declined to 26.7 +- 3.1 ml/min/1.73 m2 at baseline (P = 0.03) and 25.8 +- 6.2 ml/min/1.73 m2 at the 12-month follow-up visit (P = 0.62). The mean serum creatinine (SCr) level of 2 +- 0.3 mg/dl 1 year before the infusion increased to 2.5 +- 0.4 mg/dl at baseline (P = 0.04) and 2.5 +- 0.6 mg/dl at the 12-month follow-up (P = 0.96). This indicated significant changes between the differences of these two periods (12 months before infusion to baseline, and 12 months after infusion to baseline) in SCr (P = 0.05), but not eGFR (P = 0.09). CONCLUSIONS: This trial demonstrated the safety and tolerability of an intravenous transplantation of autologous BMMSCs. BMMSC efficacy in ADPKD patients should be investigated in a randomized placebo-controlled trial with a larger population, which we intend to perform.

28212688	Incidence and survival of end-stage kidney disease due to polycystic kidney disease in Australia and New Zealand (1963-2014).	BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine whether the incidence and survival of patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) due to polycystic kidney disease (PKD) has changed in Australia and New Zealand. METHODS: Data for all PKD patients who developed ESKD and commenced renal replacement therapy (RRT) was assessed using the Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry from 1963 to 2014. RESULTS: A total 4678 patients with ESKD due to PKD received RRT during the study period. The incidence rate of ESKD (per million population per year) due to PKD rose by 3.2-fold (1970-2010), but the percentage increase between each decade decreased (54.4, 43.8, 25.6 and 6.57%). The median age of onset of new patients developing ESKD has been stable since 1990. Haemodialysis was the most common initial mode of RRT (between 62 and 76% of patients) whereas 24-29% received peritoneal dialysis. The 5-year survival rate of PKD patients on RRT (censored for transplantation and adjusted for age) improved from 26 to 84%, with the percentage increase between each successive time period being 123, 7, 21, 19 and 7.4%. The percentage of deaths on RRT due to cerebrovascular disease declined from 15 to 6%. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence and age of onset of ESKD due to PKD has remained unchanged in the modern era though patient survival on RRT has continued to improve. These data suggest that the development and implementation of disease-specific treatments prior to RRT is needed to effectively diminish the incidence of ESKD due to PKD.
29064957	An Evaluation of the Safety and Efficacy of Simultaneous Bilateral Nephrectomy and Renal Transplantation for Polycystic Kidney Disease: A 20-Year Experience.	BACKGROUND: Many strategies regarding timing of native nephrectomies exist for patients with symptomatic polycystic kidney disease (PCKD). METHODS: This is a single-center, retrospective study of 594 adults with PCKD who had renal transplants from 1994 to 2014. Three groups were analyzed: renal transplant-only recipients (tx alone), recipients of simultaneous bilateral nephrectomies and transplant (simultaneous), and recipients with pretransplant bilateral nephrectomies (pre). The primary outcome was graft survival. Secondary outcomes included postoperative complications. RESULTS: Five hundred sixty-five adults with PCKD received kidney transplants (303 tx alone, 161 simultaneous, 27 pre). Ten-year posttransplant graft survival was 68.5%, 63.6%, and 65.7% for tx alone, simultaneous, and precohorts (P = 0.86). No statistically significant differences were observed in rates of postoperative ileus, deep vein thrombosis, small bowel obstruction, urinary stricture, urine leak, hernia formation, and delayed graft function. More wound complications were seen in prepatients (25.9% vs 11.1% tx alone, 5.1% simultaneous; P = 0.03), whereas simultaneous patients had a lower incidence of lymphocele (1.3% vs 11.1% pre, 10.2% tx-alone; P = 0.002). Importantly, simultaneous patients had more renal vascular thromboses (4.4% vs 1.3% tx alone, 0% pre; P = 0.04). 16.3% of renal transplant alone patients required nephrectomy at 10 years follow-up. Twenty-nine patients were referred for transplant having had nephrectomies and were ultimately not transplanted. In 4 of these patients who had data available for analysis, the mean panel-reactive antibody significantly increased after nephrectomy was performed. CONCLUSIONS: Simultaneous bilateral nephrectomy can be safely performed at the time of renal transplantation, however, carries a significantly increased risk of renal vascular thrombosis.

31696849	Predialysis nephrology care and its impact on initial vascular access type in hemodialysis patients in Jordan.	Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients who reach end-stage renal disease (ESRD) require early nephrology referral and appropriate vascular access. Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is the preferred access for hemodialysis (HD). Referral to nephrology of CKD patients starting HD in Jordan and its impact on AVF utilization is unknown. Patients on in-center HD in a large Jordan Ministry of Health dialysis unit were interviewed, and medical records reviewed to assess prior nephrology care and AVF use. Of 104 total patients, 93 met the inclusion criteria. The mean age was 50 +- 16 years, with 44% being females. The average body mass index was 25 +- 5. The cause of ESRD was diabetes mellitus in 28 (30%), hypertension in 28 (30%), and polycystic kidney disease in three (3%). Type of HD access at the initiation of dialysis was central venous catheter (CVC) in 80 (86%) and AVF in 12 (13%). Of the overall group, 50 (54%) were seen by nephrology before initiating dialysis, and of these, 39 patients (78%) were seen >1 year before HD initiation. Of the patients who initiated dialysis with a CVC, 38 (48%) had received prior nephrology care. All 12 patients who initiated dialysis with AVF had received prior nephrology care. Of the 50 patients who received nephrology care before dialysis initiation, 12 patients (24%) had started dialysis with an AVF; in patients without prior nephrology care, all were started with a CVC. In conclusion, our study suggests that a large percentage did not have nephrology care before initiating dialysis. The ones who were seen by nephrology before dialysis were significantly more likely to initiate dialysis using an AVF. A national focus on improving nephrology referral in advanced CKD may allow better utilization of AVF as the method of access at dialysis initiation.
38231231	Use of a donor kidney with known autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease in a highly sensitised paediatric recipient.	We report the use of an autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) donor kidney in a paediatric recipient. A 14-year-old boy on haemodialysis for 4 years following loss of a first kidney transplant, highly sensitised, and with limited vascular options for ongoing dialysis access, was offered a deceased brain death donor transplant from a mid-30s donor with known ADPKD but normal kidney function and negligible proteinuria. After extensive discussion with the patient and family, discussing all alternative options and review of available literature, the kidney was accepted and implanted. Graft function was immediate. An early post-transplant creatinine rise was attributed to possible antibody-mediated rejection, treated with plasmapheresis and rituximab. Ten months post-transplant, the patient remains dialysis-free with stable function. Extended criteria kidneys are already considered for highly sensitised or long-waiting dialysis patients. Though the literature is limited, kidneys from patients with ADPKD could be considered within extended criteria offers on a case-by-case basis.
27759554	Posttransplant Outcomes of Patients With Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease Versus Other Recipients: A 10-Year Report From South of Iran.	OBJECTIVES: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is the most common hereditary disorder resulting in end-stage renal disease that can affect other organs besides kidneys. Extrarenal involvement may increase mortality and morbidity. Approximately 50% of patients with this disorder require renal transplant. Posttransplant complications have been reported to be equal in these patients versus other recipients. We conducted this study to determine and compare characteristics and outcomes of transplanted patients with this disease versus other recipients at the only transplant center in southern Iran. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Detailed data of patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease were collected from medical records from the Shiraz Organ Transplantation Center. We also gathered data on a matched control group of transplant recipients who had end-stage renal disease due to other reasons, including other congenital kidney diseases and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Medical records of patients before and after transplant were reviewed. Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS software version 19 (Chicago, IL, USA). RESULTS: We collected data from 2002 to 2012 on 101 patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and 100 control patients, including 74 female (36.8%) and 127 male patients (63.2%). Average duration of pretransplant dialysis was 14.9 +- 10.3 months in study patients and 12.8 +- 8.1 months in control patients. Rejection rate was statistically greater in recipients with this disease (30 patients; 68%) versus controls (14 patients; 32%) (P = .010). CONCLUSIONS: Short- and long-term survival rates of patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease were not statistically different from control patients. However, graft survival was significantly lower. In short- and long-term follow-up of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease patients, hemoglobin and hematocrit levels were slightly higher than those of the control group. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is not a risk factor for posttransplant diabetes mellitus.
33573817	Risk Factors, Diagnosis, and Treatment of Lymphocele After Renal Transplantation: A Retrospective Study.	INTRODUCTION: Despite recent advances, lymphoceles are the most frequent complications following renal transplantation (RT), with an incidence of 0.6% to 51%. In this study, we present risk factors, treatments, and outcomes for lymphoceles after RT at our center. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Since January 2018, 461 RTs were performed at our center. Nine recipients were excluded. The remaining 452 RTs were analyzed retrospectively. Recipients were divided into 2 groups: a lymphocele group (n = 29) and a nonlymphocele group (n = 423). Lymphoceles were diagnosed by ultrasound. Statistical analyses were made using the SPSS 15 software program. RESULTS: Twenty-nine (6.4%) of the 452 recipients developed lymphoceles. Seven of these 29 (24.1%) recipients were asymptomatic. The most common symptom was hydronephrosis (34.4%). Percutaneous drainage was performed in 21 recipients; sclerotherapy with percutaneous drainage was used in the remaining 8. In 5 (17.2%) recipients, there was a recurrence of lymphoceles. There were significant differences with respect to age (50-65 years; P = .016), use of a drainage catheter (P = .044), and polycystic kidney diseases (P = .049). CONCLUSION: Lymphoceles can be treated successfully using the percutaneous drainage technique alone or in combination with povidone iodine. Drainage use, polycystic kidney disease, and age (50-65 years) were established as risk factors for lymphocele development.
39289130	Core Patient-Reported Outcomes for Trials in Nephrology.	The outcomes reported in trials across all stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are highly variable and often do not include outcomes that are directly relevant to patients and caregivers. Frequently, the outcomes reported in trials are often unvalidated surrogate biochemical end points. The omission of outcomes that are meaningful and important to patients can diminish the value of trials in supporting treatment decisions. In response, there have been increasing efforts across many health and medical disciplines to develop core outcome sets, defined as the minimum set of outcomes to be reported in all trials in a specific health area to improve the relevance and consistency of reporting trial outcomes. The international Standardized Outcomes in Nephrology (SONG) initiative was established in 2014 and has since developed seven core outcome sets for different diagnosis and treatment stages of CKD. The core outcomes were based on consensus among patients, caregivers, and health professionals. Each core outcome set includes at least one patient-reported outcome, including fatigue (hemodialysis), life participation (kidney transplantation, peritoneal dialysis, early CKD not yet requiring kidney replacement therapy, children and adolescents, and glomerular disease), and pain (polycystic kidney disease). This article outlines how patient-reported outcomes are currently reported in trials, discusses core patient-reported outcomes that have been established for trials in kidney disease, and outlines strategies for implementing core patient-reported outcomes in trials.
29145282	Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease combined with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: A case report.	INTRODUCTION: This report describes the novel sampling of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) combined with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). SYMPTOMS AND CLINICAL FINDINGS: A 48-year-old Chinese man presented with anasarca, hypourocrinia, gross hematuria, and weight gain by 10 kg subsequently developed acute kidney injury after struck by acute respiratory distress syndrome, really a threat to his heart. DIAGNOSES: Abdominal ultrasound revealed multiple small cysts in both kidneys, with the right kidney measuring 11.6 cm in length, and the left kidney measuring 11.5 cm in length, which supported ADPKD. Echocardiography showed left ventricular posterior wall thickness measuring 15.2 mm, interventricular septum measuring 17.2 mm, left atrial size 31.9 mm, ejection fraction measuring 69%, approving the diagnose of HCM. THERAPEUTICS INTERVENTIONS: Because of the failure treatment with tripterygium wilfordii and valsartan, the patient was administered with prednisone 1 mg/kg/day. Continuous renal replacement therapy was required to prevent heart and kidney from failure. OUTCOMES: The patient responded well and his renal function improved. CONCLUSION: This is the first reported case of ADPKD with HCM, with complete remission of acute kidney injury and preservation of cardiac function. Serial checks and measures should be considered for appropriate treatment of ADPKD patient who present with rapid decline of renal function. We present detailed analysis of the patient's disease course and review literature. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report. It has been permitted by Committee on Ethics of Biomedicine, Second Military Medical University.

25905984	Intravitreal Antivascular Endothelial Growth Factor Therapy May Induce Proteinuria and Antibody Mediated Injury in Renal Allografts.	INTRODUCTION: Systemic adverse effects of intravenous antivascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy include: hypertension, proteinuria, renal failure, and thrombotic microangiopathy. Intravitreal therapy with these agents is generally believed to be safe. METHODS: We report 2 cases of renal transplant recipients who developed significant allograft dysfunction after the initiation of intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy. RESULTS: The first case is a 67-year-old man with polycystic kidney disease and recipient of a zero-antigen mismatch kidney allograft which developed worsening proteinuria over the first year after transplantation. At 4 months, a biopsy showed only minimal fibrosis and atrophy. At 1 year, an allograft biopsy showed phospholipase A 2 receptor-negative membranous nephropathy. The second patient was a 52-year-old man with tuberous sclerosis who was a recipient of a living related kidney allograft with diminished but stable graft function 16 years from transplantation. After the initiation of intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy, there was an escalating degree of proteinuria. Renal biopsy revealed acute and chronic antibody-mediated rejection with glomerular thrombi and transplant glomerulopathy. CONCLUSIONS: These cases, although do not prove causality, point to the need for careful follow-up of renal transplant recipients undergoing intravitreal therapy with anti-VEGF agents. These locally administered agents may play a role in the development of proteinuria and modulate antibody-mediated phenomena. We recommend that in renal transplant recipients undergoing therapy with intravitreal anti-VEGF agents, proteinuria be checked monthly, and there should be a low threshold for performing a biopsy to evaluate for allograft injury.
36128601	Utilizing the same incision for staged renal transplant in patients with polycystic kidney disease requiring hand-assisted laparoscopic nephrectomy.	BACKGROUNDS: Many autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) patients undergo nephrectomy and subsequent renal transplantation. We report our outcomes after hand-assisted laparoscopic nephrectomy (HALN) where a Rutherford-Morrison incision is used as a hand-port site and kidney extraction site, as well the future incision site for staged transplantation. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed on all adult nephrectomies for ADPKD by the Transplant Surgery department at Westmead Hospital between June 2011 and June 2021. Outcomes were compared between HALN, laparoscopic nephrectomy (LN) and open nephrectomy (ON) including operation time, hospital length of stay (LOS), post-operative complications, subsequent transplantation and post-transplantation wound complications. RESULTS: Twenty-two HALN, 8 LN and 5 ON were performed during the study period. Median kidney weights for HALN, LN and ON were significantly different (1575, 403, 3420 g respectively, P = 0.001). There was a significant difference in LOS between the HALN and ON (5.8 versus 9.8 days, P = 0.04), but not between HALN and LN (5.8 versus 5.1, P = 0.06). There was no significant difference for operation time (P = 0.34) and major complication rates (P = 0.58). There were 8 HALN, 5 LN and 2 ON who have had subsequent renal transplantation with one wound complication, an incisional hernia in the HALN group. CONCLUSION: Our HALN is associated with a shorter LOS and similar complication rate to ON and can be efficiently performed for significantly larger kidneys than LN without a significant difference in operation time or LOS. The same Rutherford-Morrison incision site can be used for transplantation.
38427307	Elevated hemoglobin levels in renal transplant recipients with polycystic kidney disease versus other etiologies: exploring mechanisms and implications for outcomes.	BACKGROUND: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD)-related end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) often necessitates transplantation. However, the impact of ADPKD on post-transplant outcomes, specifically hemoglobin levels, remains unknown. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 513 Kidney Transplant Recipients (KTRs), of whom 81 had ESKD due to ADPKD (20 with pre-transplant native nephrectomy and 61 without). Hemoglobin levels were evaluated at multiple time intervals post-transplant. RESULTS: Kidney transplant recipients with ADPKD vs. KTRs with ESKD due to other causes exhibited significantly higher hemoglobin levels in repeated measurement analysis. Multivariable analyses confirmed ADPKD as an independent predictor for elevated hemoglobin levels. In a multivariable logistic regression analysis, the odds for maximum hemoglobin > 15 mg/dL at 3-12 months post-transplant were more than twice as high in ADPKD patients vs. all the other KTRs (Odds Ratio [OR] 2.31, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.3-4.13, p < 0.001). Pre-transplant native nephrectomy revealed a trend toward lower hemoglobin levels. Elevated hemoglobin levels were linked to improved estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at one year post-transplant. Patient survival was enhanced among KTRs with ADPKD compared to other ESKD causes. CONCLUSIONS: Kidney transplant recipients with ADPKD exhibited elevated hemoglobin levels post-transplant, possibly due to prolonged native kidney erythropoietin production. These elevated hemoglobin levels were linked to improved outcomes, including allograft function and patient survival. Future research should further investigate the underlying mechanisms driving favorable ADPKD KTR outcomes.
37875772	Complications and prognosis of patients diagnosed with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease in neonatal period.	There are no clinical guidelines for performing nephrectomy in patients with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD). Few reports have described the clinical course of ARPKD diagnosed in the neonatal period in detail. Here, we report seven patients diagnosed with ARPKD and treated at our center during the neonatal period. Two died within 48 h of life due to pulmonary hypoplasia. Of the remaining five patients, three had anuria and required for kidney replacement therapy (KRT) within one week after birth, whereas two with a milder phenotype survived without KRT. All three patients who received KRT underwent unilateral nephrectomy and peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheter placement. To prevent fluid leakage, PD was initiated 7-14 days after catheter placement. However, peritoneal leakage occurred in two patients, resulting in peritonitis and discontinuation of PD; one who required long-term hemodialysis contracted a catheter-related bloodstream infection as well as developed subdural and epidural hematomas. Meanwhile, two patients underwent a second nephrectomy within 6 weeks after birth; one developed severe persistent hypotension and neurological complications, while the other died of bacteremia that may have resulted from cholangitis diagnosed on day 67 of life. A severe clinical course, life-threatening adverse events, and severe neurological sequalae may occur in patients with ARPKD who receive KRT in neonatal period.
30910370	Oxalosis Associated With High-Dose Vitamin C Ingestion in a Peritoneal Dialysis Patient.	We report a case of systemic oxalosis involving the eyes and joints due to long-term use of high-dose vitamin C in a patient receiving maintenance peritoneal dialysis (PD). This 76-year-old woman with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease underwent living unrelated kidney transplantation 10 years earlier. The transplant failed 6 months before presentation, and she initiated hemodialysis therapy before transitioning to PD therapy 4 months later. During the month before presentation, the patient noted worsening arthralgias and decreased vision. Ophthalmologic examination revealed proliferative retinopathy and calcium oxalate crystals. Plasma oxalate level was markedly elevated at 187 (reference range, <1.7) mumol/L, and urine oxalate-creatinine ratio was high (0.18mg/mg). The patient reported taking up to 4g of vitamin C per day for several years. Workup for causes of primary and secondary hyperoxaluria was otherwise negative. Vitamin C use was discontinued, and the patient transitioned to daily hemodialysis for 2 weeks. Plasma oxalate level before the dialysis session decreased but remained higher (30-53mumol/L) than typical for dialysis patients. Upon discharge, the patient remained on thrice-weekly hemodialysis therapy with stabilized vision and improved joint symptoms. This case highlights the risk of high-dose vitamin C use in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease, especially when maintained on PD therapy.
27998045	How can a vascular surgeon help in kidney transplantation.	Kidney transplantation is a surgical procedure involving both vascular and ureteric anastomoses. As a matter of fact, it can be performed either by urologists or vascular surgeons. However, vascular surgeon's expertise can be helpful at different times. In the present paper we describe how can vascular surgeons help at the different stages of kidney transplantation process in modern care: 1) before kidney transplantation for recipient preparation in order to allow subsequent graft implantation, either by performing percutaneous embolization of renal arteries in the setting of polycystic kidney disease or treatment of aneurysmal or occlusive lesions that would contra-indicate graft implantation; 2) at the time of surgery graft back table preparation and repair; and 3) after surgery for long-term follow-up, including transplant renal artery stenosis treatment or transplant nephrectomy.
35422167	Supine PCNL in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.	AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: Standard percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) has routinely been performed in prone position in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) with nephrolithiasis. The objectives of our present study is to ensure optimum access to the renal collecting system, reducing operative time, and anesthetic morbidity during supine PCNL in ADPKD with nephrolithiasis. METHODS: Seven patients were selected randomly. There were no preference for age, gender, size, location and laterality of stone, or BMI . All the patients fit into the AUA guideline criteria for management by percutaneous nephrolithotomy. Preoperative, perioperative, and follow up data were collected prospectively. RESULTS: Seven patients underwent supine PCNL in approximately 2.5 year in modified supine position. There was no intraoperative, post operative, or on follow up complications in any patient. In all the patients stones were cleared completely in single sitting. CONCLUSIONS: Supine PCNL in ADPKD with nephrolithiasis is an alternative with similar outcomes to the standard prone PCNL. It provides an additional benefit of performing the procedure in a single position, which is known to reduce total operating time, less anesthesia related complications, less neuromusculoskeletal injury, and reduce physical strain on operating.
35845334	Pretransplant Dialysis and Preemptive Transplant in Living Donor Kidney Recipients.	Background: The optimal timing of dialysis access placement in individuals with stage 5 CKD is challenging to estimate. Preemptive living donor kidney transplant (LDKT) is the gold-standard treatment for ESKD due to superior graft survival and mortality, but dialysis initiation is often required. Among LDKT recipients, we sought to determine which clinical characteristics were associated with preemptive transplant. Among non-preemptive LDKT recipients, we sought to determine what dialysis access was used, and their duration of use before receipt of living donor transplant. Methods: We retrospectively extracted data on 569 LDKT recipients, >18 years old, who were transplanted between January 2014 and July 2019 at UCSF, including dialysis access type (arteriovenous fistula [AVF], arteriovenous graft [AVG], peritoneal dialysis catheter [PD], and venous catheter), duration of dialysis, and clinical characteristics. Results: Preemptive LDKT recipients constituted 30% of our cohort and were older, more likely to be White, more likely to have ESKD from polycystic kidney disease, and less likely to have ESKD from type 2 diabetes. Of the non-preemptive patients, 26% used AVF, 0.5% used AVG, 32% used peritoneal catheter, 11% used venous catheter, and 31% used more than one access type. Median (IQR) time on dialysis for AVF/AVG use was 1.86 (0.85-3.32) years; for PD catheters, 1.12 (0.55-1.92) years; for venous catheters, 0.66 (0.23-1.69) years; and for multimodal access, 2.15 (1.37-3.72) years. Conclusions: We characterized the dialysis access landscape in LDKT recipients. Venous catheter and PD were the most popular modality in the first quartile of dialysis, and patients using these modalities had shorter times on dialysis compared with those with an AVF. Venous catheter or PD can be considered a viable bridge therapy in patients with living donor availability given their shorter waitlist times. Earlier referral of patients with living donor prospects might further minimize dialysis need.
38511986	Laparoscopic Nephrectomy Via the Retroperitoneal Approach for Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease After Renal Transplant: A Case Report.	We report a case of laparoscopic nephrectomy via the retroperitoneal approach for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease after renal transplant. A 54-year-old male patient with end-stage renal failure because of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease underwent a living donor renal transplant and right nephrectomy via open surgery through a median abdominal incision 5 years previously. However, the left kidney gradually became enlarged. We performed laparoscopic left nephrectomy via the retroperitoneal approach. After dissecting the renal vessels, we performed cyst puncture and aspiration to decrease the kidney volume. The patient's symptoms improved after operation. Laparoscopic nephrectomy for enlarged kidneys with multiple cysts can be safely performed, and the retroperitoneal approach can be preferred if the patient has a history of abdominal surgery or an enlarged polycystic kidney.
29108517	Inferior Long-Term Outcomes for Kidney Transplant Recipients With an Immunologically Mediated Primary Renal Disease.	OBJECTIVES: Recurrent glomerulonephritis can negatively affect kidney allograft survival. However, how primary renal disease affects transplant outcomes in the new era of immunosuppression remains unclear. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We categorized 426 kidney transplant recipients (performed from 1996 to 2007) into 4 disease groups: (1) 99 recipients with biopsy-proven immunologically mediated kidney disease, (2) 40 recipients with urologic disease, (3) 67 recipients with polycystic kidney disease, and (4) 220 recipients with other causes of terminal renal failure/uncertain kidney disease. Long-term transplant outcomes were compared between groups at 1, 5, and 10 years of follow-up. RESULTS: Compared with the urologic, polycystic, and other diseases groups, the immunologic group showed significantly lower time of graft survival (9.5 +- 4 vs 8 +- 4 vs 8.5 +- 4 vs 7 +- 4 years, respectively) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (52.5 +- 32 vs 49 +- 22 vs 50 +- 32 vs 35.5 +- 30 mL/min; P < .05). Relative risk of 10-year graft loss for the immunologic group was 2.8 (95% confidence interval, 1.6-4.9). Recurrence rate was 12% in the immunologic group versus 1% and 0% in the other diseases and remaining groups (P < .05). The relative risk of 10-year graft loss for patients with recurrence was 2.7 (95% confidence interval, 1.2-6.3). Ten-year graft loss rates for patients with biopsy-proven acute rejection, chronic allograft nephropathy, and recurrent glomerulonephritis were 30%, 23%, and 42% (P < .05). For those with biopsy-proven recurrent glomerulonephritis, 10-year estimated glomerular filtration rate was significantly lower than for those with biopsy-proven acute rejection or chronic allograft nephropathy (14 +- 6 vs 18 +- 7 vs 30 +- 10 mL/min; P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Kidney transplant recipients with immunologically mediated kidney diseases have inferior long-term allograft survival and function versus patients with other causes of renal failure. Recurrence represents the strongest risk factor for premature loss of function and transplant failure.
25973696	Pre-transplant angiotensin receptor II type 1 antibodies and risk of post-transplant focal segmental glomerulosclerosis recurrence.	Post-kidney transplant recurrence of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a major problem. AT1R is expressed on podocyte; its expression is elevated in the proteinuric state. Using an ELISA, we tested pre-transplant sera of 28 patients with history of idiopathic FSGS for anti-AT1R levels and serum soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) as a biomarker for risk of recurrence of FSGS. Sera from 11 patients with polycystic kidney disease (PKD) were used as controls. Twelve patients had biopsy proven post-transplant FSGS recurrence at 1.5 months. No difference was found in the pre-transplant suPAR levels of FSGS patients (5993 +- 2292 pg/mL) vs. PKD (7334 +- 4538 pg/mL) (p = 0.23). Serum suPAR levels in patients with FSGS recurrence (5786 +- 1899 pg/mL) vs. no FSGS recurrence (6149 +- 2598 pg/mL) (p = 0.69) were not different. Anti-AT1R levels in patients with FSGS were 12.66 +- 11.85 U/mL vs. 8.69 +- 6.52 U/mL in PKD (p = 0.32); however, a difference was found in patients with and without FSGS recurrence 20.41 +- 14.36 U/mL 6.84 +- 4.181 U/mL, respectively (p < 0.01). Area under curve for suPAR and anti-AT1R to predict post-transplant FSGS recurrence was 0.51 and 0.84, respectively. Pre-transplant anti-AT1R levels appear to be a helpful biomarker in identifying patients at high risk of post-transplant FSGS recurrence.
24550663	Successful pregnancy in a patient with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease on long-term hemodialysis.	Recent advances in dialysis and a multidisciplinary approach to pregnant patients with advanced chronic kidney disease provide a better outcome. A 38-yr-old female with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) became pregnant. She was undergoing hemodialysis (HD) and her kidneys were massively enlarged, posing a risk of intrauterine fetal growth restriction. By means of intensive HD and optimal management of anemia, pregnancy was successfully maintained until vaginal delivery at 34.5 weeks of gestation. We discuss the special considerations involved in managing our patient with regard to the underlying ADPKD and its influence on pregnancy. 
34462140	Between a Rock and a Hard Place-Colonic Obstruction Between Two Kidneys: A Case Report.	We report a case of a 70-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease secondary to polycystic kidney disease with a previous failed transplant who presented for a cadaveric extraperitoneal renal transplant. The patient developed a progressively worsening bowel obstruction postoperatively and evidence of an obstruction was observed on computed tomography imaging with a transition point at the level of the sigmoid colon. Consequent to this, she underwent an exploratory laparotomy, which revealed kinking of the colon secondary to the compression between the transplanted and the left native polycystic kidneys. There were adhesive bands between the native kidney and the descending colon in the retroperitoneal space maintaining it in a fixed position mechanically. The addition of a retroperitoneal transplant exacerbated this kink and was responsible for the bowel obstruction. Her left colon was completely mobilized to relieve her obstruction, and owing to her bowel distension, her abdomen was left open for 2 days before returning to the operating room to remove her left native polycystic kidney to allow space for safe closure. This report highlights an extremely unusual cause of large bowel obstruction post-kidney transplantation.
29388019	Volume Reduction in Enlarged Kidneys in Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) Prior to Renal Transplant with Transcatheter Arterial Embolization (TAE): A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.	PURPOSE: Symptomatically enlarged kidneys observed in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) patients can lead to compression symptoms and contraindications to renal transplantation. Surgical nephrectomy can be utilized to increase space in the abdomen prior to renal transplantation; however, not all individuals are appropriate candidates for this procedure. Transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) of the renal arteries can provide a noninvasive way to reduce renal volume in ADPKD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a systematic literature review on the usage of TAE to reduce renal volume prior to kidney transplantation and to relief compression symptoms in ADPKD. PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library were searched for articles focused on the usage of TAE to reduce renal volume in symptomatic enlarged kidneys. Renal volume data were compiled, and meta-analysis was performed with three or more studies. RESULTS: Six papers satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Significant renal volume reduction was observed by 12 months in all studies. Success of TAE was measured with three clinical outcomes: removal of contraindication for renal transplant, relief of compression symptoms, and pulmonary function test. Proportionality meta-analysis of three studies measuring relief of compression symptoms showed no significant differences in heterogeneity (p = 0.4543). CONCLUSION: Current studies conclude that TAE is an effective and minimally invasive option for reduction in renal volume in order to optimize patient outcome for renal transplantation and for relief of compression symptoms. Further prospective studies involving increased sample size and multiple centers should be pursued to establish evidence-based guidelines.
30056873	Eye Problems in Patients on the Active and Inactive Kidney Transplantation Waiting List.	Renal transplant is the best form of treatment for most patients with end-stage renal disease. The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence of eye problems in patients with end-stage renal disease on the kidney transplantation waiting list in regard to their status (active vs temporarily disqualified). The cross-sectional study was conducted on 90 prevalent patients in 1 regional qualification center. There were 24 peritoneally dialyzed patients, 5 patients registered for preemptive transplantation, and 61 hemodialyzed patients. Average age of patients who had been registered on the cadaver kidney waiting list was 50 (+- 14) years, with a balanced sex ratio and median dialysis duration of 38 months. The primary cause of end-stage renal failure was chronic glomerulonephritis in 42 cases, diabetic nephropathy in 10 cases, hypertensive nephropathy in 12 cases, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease in 7 cases, and other or unknown in the remaining patients. The major diagnosis was hypertensive angiopathy (related to the presence of long-term hypertension and history of kidney disease) in 56 patients, diabetic retinopathy in 8 patients, blindness in 4 cases (due to solvent intoxication in 1 case), and eyesight abnormalities (myopia, hyperopia, anisometropia) in 7 cases. Cataracts were described in 10 patients in addition to other findings. In 15 patients ophthalmology examination was normal, predominantly in younger patients. Abnormalities were more common in patients on the inactive list. In the vast majority of potential kidney transplant recipients, ophthalmology disturbances are primarily related to the underlying disease. The ophthalmology consult is part of the qualification, but the abnormalities are not the exclusion criteria.
25331786	Effects of dietary interventions on incidence and progression of CKD.	Traditional strategies for management of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have not resulted in any change in the growing prevalence of CKD worldwide. A historic belief that eating healthily might ameliorate kidney disease still holds credibility in the 21(st) century. Dietary sodium restriction to <2.3 g daily, a diet rich in fruits and vegetables and increased water consumption corresponding to a urine output of 3-4 l daily might slow the progression of early CKD, polycystic kidney disease or recurrent kidney stones. Current evidence suggests that a reduction in dietary net acid load could be beneficial in patients with CKD, but the supremacy of any particular diet has yet to be established. More trials of dietary interventions are needed, especially in diabetic nephropathy, before evidence-based recommendations can be made. In the meantime, nephrologists should discuss healthy dietary habits with their patients and provide individualized care aimed at maximizing the potential benefits of dietary intervention, reducing the incidence of CKD and delaying its progression to end-stage renal disease. Keeping in mind the lack of data on hard outcomes, dietary recommendations should take into account barriers to adherence and be tailored to different cultures, ethnicities and geographical locations. 
24919173	Cyst infection in hospital-admitted autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease patients is predominantly multifocal and associated with kidney and liver volume.	Positron-emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) has improved cyst infection (CI) management in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). The determinants of kidney and/or liver involvement, however, remain uncertain. In this study, we evaluated clinical and imaging factors associated with CI in kidney (KCI) and liver (LCI) in ADPKD. A retrospective cohort study was performed in hospital-admitted ADPKD patients with suspected CI. Clinical, imaging and surgical data were analyzed. Features of infected cysts were evaluated by PET/CT. Total kidney (TKV) and liver (TLV) volumes were measured by CT-derived multiplanar reconstruction. CI was detected in 18 patients who experienced 24 episodes during an interval of 30 months (LCI in 12, KCI in 10 and concomitant infection in 2). Sensitivities of CT, magnetic resonance imaging and PET/CT were 25.0, 71.4, and 95.0%. Dysuria (P<0.05), positive urine culture (P<0.01), and previous hematuria (P<0.05) were associated with KCI. Weight loss (P<0.01) and increased C-reactive protein levels (P<0.05) were associated with LCI. PET/CT revealed that three or more infected cysts were present in 70% of the episodes. TKV was higher in kidney-affected than in LCI patients (AUC=0.91, P<0.05), with a cut-off of 2502 mL (72.7% sensitivity, 100.0% specificity). TLV was higher in liver-affected than in KCI patients (AUC=0.89, P<0.01) with a cut-off of 2815 mL (80.0% sensitivity, 87.5% specificity). A greater need for invasive procedures was observed in LCI (P<0.01), and the overall mortality was 20.8%. This study supports PET/CT as the most sensitive imaging method for diagnosis of cyst infection, confirms the multifocal nature of most hospital-admitted episodes, and reveals an association of kidney and liver volumes with this complication.
31896110	Budd-Chiari Syndrome after Bilateral Nephrectomy for Polycystic Kidney Disease in a Kidney Transplant Recipient.	We report a rare case of Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) as a postoperative complication after bilateral nephrectomy in a kidney transplant recipient with polycystic liver and kidneys. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen showed a narrowed inferior vena cava, compressed by the polycystic liver that moved downwards after nephrectomy. A stenting angioplasty was performed, resulting in remarkable clinical improvement. This case highlights the need for careful evaluation of polycystic kidneys and their anatomic relationship with the liver before nephrectomy, as well as for considering BCS as a differential diagnosis in similar cases.
25242762	Complicated diverticulitis in kidney transplanted patients: analysis of 717 cases.	INTRODUCTION: This study aims to investigate possible risk factors for diverticulitis in kidney transplant recipients affected by colonic diverticulosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: We investigated 717 patients transplanted between 2000 and 2010. Diverticular disease was endoscopically diagnosed in 17 of 717 examined patients. Eight patients were diagnosed with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD); 9 of 17 patients underwent emergency surgery. We performed Hartmann's procedure on all patients, with a second stage performed at least 6 months later. DISCUSSION: Although the incidence of colonic diverticular perforation in kidney transplanted patients is similar to that observed in the general population, perforation in immunosuppressed patients is associated with a higher morbidity/mortality rate. In our study, the incidence of perforation is 1.25% (9 of 717), with almost half of the cases observed in patients with ADPKD (4 of 9). Such an observation is consistent with published data, in which patients with ADPKD are reported to more frequently develop colonic diverticulosis and its complications. One possible explanation might be related to a belated diagnosis of diverticulitis, which could initially simulate an inflammatory disease as a consequence of renal cysts. Also, steroids seem to be a predisposing factor for colonic perforation in these patients. CONCLUSIONS: A timely surgery can significantly reduce mortality. In cases of elective surgery, mortality and morbidity are similar to those of immunocompetent patients; accordingly, this is the goal to be pursued. Early signs and symptoms are often masked by immunosuppressive therapy. In these patients, surgeons should always perform (1) abdominal computed tomography scanning and, in the presence of diverticulitis, reduce or withdraw immunosuppressive therapy; and (2) early surgery, with Hartmann's procedure being, in our opinion, the best choice. Before transplantation, elective surgery for colonic resection should be considered in patients with ADPKD or with a history of 1 or more episodes of acute diverticulitis who then regressed with medical therapy.
25689458	Therapies for polycystic kidney disease.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: All polycystic diseases of the kidney exhibit tubular or saccular cysts. The cysts can either be open to the tubule or isolated sacs that have lost their connections. Polycystic kidney diseases derived from different genetic mutations share basic mechanisms of cytogenesis, formation, and progressive enlargement, involving a cellular organelle called the primary cilium. Given the mechanistic commonalities, this review will focus on the therapeutic approaches currently available or under development that likely apply to all inherited renal cystic diseases. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent advances in clinical trials and preclinical experiments have illuminated common signaling pathway involvement. SUMMARY: Avoidance of nephrotoxic drugs or radio-contrast and maintaining normal BMI are routine preventive measures. Limiting the intake of calories, salt, and protein, together with increased intake of fruits, vegetables, and water are dietary treatments that should be started early in the course of the disease. Potential pharmacological treatments targeting cyst initiation and progression are on the horizon.
32771648	Establishing a Core Outcome Set for Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease: Report of the Standardized Outcomes in Nephrology-Polycystic Kidney Disease (SONG-PKD) Consensus Workshop.	"The omission of outcomes that are of relevance to patients, clinicians, and regulators across trials in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) limits shared decision making. The Standardized Outcomes in Nephrology-Polycystic Kidney Disease (SONG-PKD) Initiative convened an international consensus workshop on October 25, 2018, to discuss the identification and implementation of a potential core outcome set for all ADPKD trials. This article summarizes the discussion from the workshops and the SONG-PKD core outcome set. Key stakeholders including 11 patients/caregivers and 47 health professionals (nephrologists, policy makers, industry, and researchers) attended the workshop. Four themes emerged: ""Relevance of trajectory and impact of kidney function"" included concerns about a patient's prognosis and uncertainty of when they may need to commence kidney replacement therapy and the lack of an early prognostic marker to inform long-term decisions; ""Discerning and defining pain specific to ADPKD"" highlighted the challenges in determining the origin of pain, adapting to the chronicity and repeated episodes of pain, the need to place emphasis on pain management, and to have a validated measure for pain; ""Highlighting ADPKD consequences"" encompassed cyst-related complications and reflected patient's knowledge because of family history and the hereditary nature of ADPKD; and ""Risk for life-threatening but rare consequences"" such as cerebral aneurysm meant considering both frequency and severity of the outcome. Kidney function, mortality, cardiovascular disease, and pain were established as the core outcomes for ADPKD."
31584623	Diagnosis of Congenital Hepatic Fibrosis in Adulthood.	OBJECTIVES: We studied clinicopathologic features of congenital hepatic fibrosis (CHF) that could aid the diagnosis of this relatively rare condition during adulthood. METHODS: Five consecutive adult CHF cases were identified in a single institution. RESULTS: Clinical manifestations of CHF varied from asymptomatic to requiring liver transplantation. Three of five cases had other disease associations, including Joubert syndrome, Caroli disease, polycystic kidney disease, and congenital anomaly of hepatic vasculature. No unique common radiologic findings were found. Histologically, all cases showed characteristic abnormal interlobular bile ducts embedded in fibrotic portal stroma, with varying degrees of liver fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: While other disease associations and characteristic liver histomorphology are helpful clues to suspect the diagnosis of CHF in adult patients, other differential diagnoses should be excluded clinically and radiologically. This study highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary diagnostic approach by pathologists, radiologists, and hepatologists for the accurate diagnosis of CHF during adulthood.
34911272	Kidney transplant patients at Ulleval Hospital 1963-83.	BACKGROUND: In the period November 1963 to July 1983, 118 patients received a kidney transplant at Ulleval Hospital. All future kidney transplants were subsequently performed at Oslo University Hospital, Rikshospitalet. The purpose of our study is to present demographic data and show patient and graft survival from the first patient cohort of kidney transplant recipients in Norway. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The patients were identified in surgical protocols from Ulleval Hospital and the Norwegian Renal Registry using follow-up data up to December 2016. We recorded the patients' age and sex, cause of renal failure, donor characteristics, patient and graft survival, number of retransplants and cause of death. RESULTS: 118 patients: 38 women and 80 men, aged 14-67 years, received a transplant during the reference period. The most common indicators for transplantation were chronic glomerulonephritis (n = 61), chronic pyelonephritis (n = 20) and polycystic kidney disease (n = 14). Seventy-two patients (61 %) received a kidney from a deceased donor. After one year, 94 of the patients were still living (80 %), after five years, 66 of the patients (56 %) were still living, and after twenty years, the figure was 34 (29 %). Cardiovascular disease was the most common cause of death. The median graft survival was 3.8 years (quartile range 14.4 years). Thirty-two patients underwent retransplantation. INTERPRETATION: Even in this pioneering era, patient survival rates and the functional life of donated kidneys were acceptable.
30869431	[Management of a patient with polycystic kidney disease].	Management of a patient with polycystic kidney disease. In patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, the nephrologist is typically asked to treat hypertension, urological complications (pain, stones, infections), progressive renal failure and its consequences, and finally initiate renal replacement therapy (hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, kidney transplant) for those reaching end-stage renal failure, most often in the second part of their life. We should now consider a more modern vision: in at risk subjects, an early diagnosis (around 20 years of age) will help to provide dietary advice (water intake, salt and protein intake), detect hypertension, fight against cardiovascular risk factors, detect intracranial aneurysms; in women, to give advice on contraception, pregnancies, and to detect massive polycystic liver disease; finally, to discuss advances in cystic blocking research and to propose the first of these, tolvaptan, to eligible patients. The early implementation of all these measures will likely allow a new generation of patients to have, compared to their elders, a less progressive renal disease and a reduced rate of extra-renal complications.
26546139	New onset diabetes after kidney transplantation in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease: systematic review protocol.	INTRODUCTION: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common inherited kidney disorder with numerous cysts developing in bilateral kidneys. Meanwhile, ADPKD can also be regarded as a systemic disease because the cystic and non-cystic abnormalities could be identified in multiple organs in patients with ADPKD. Several lines of evidence suggest the risk of post-transplant diabetes mellitus or new-onset diabetes after transplantation (NODAT) is higher in patients with ADPKD compared with non-ADPKD renal recipients, but the available results are conflicting. We describe the protocol of a systematic review and meta-analysis for investigating the risk of NODAT in patients with ADPKD. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: PubMed, EMBASE and The Cochrane Library will be searched. Cohort studies irrespective of language and publication status, comparing the incidence of NODAT in renal recipients with ADPKD and other kidney disease will be eligible. We will assess heterogeneity among studies. Along with 95% CIs, dichotomous data will be summarised as risk ratios; numbers needed to treat/harm and continuous data will be given as standard mean differences. Excluding outliers and testing small sample size studies if our results are robust, sensitivity analysis will be carried out. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval is not required because this study includes no confidential personal data or patient interventions. The review findings will be helpful in designing and implementing future studies and will be of interest to a wide range of readers, including healthcare professionals, researchers, health service managers and policymakers. The systematic review will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and disseminated electronically and in print. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: The study protocol has been registered in PROSPERO (http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/) under registration number CRD42014009677.
31967359	Deceased vs living donor grafts for pediatric simultaneous liver-kidney transplantation: A single-center experience.	INTRODUCTION: In conditions of limited experience of pediatric simultaneous liver-kidney transplantation (SLKT) using grafts from living and deceased donors, there is a certain need to validate the approach. PATIENTS: The retrospective study of 18 pediatric patients who received SLKT between 2008 and 2019. RESULTS: Grafts were obtained from both living and deceased donors. The patients' age ranged from 2 to 16 years (9 years +-4). The body weight of the children varied from 9.5 to 39 kg (22 kg +-9). The follow-up period lasted from 1 to 109 months (median 38 months +-35). The various graft combinations were used in both groups. There was no mortality during the follow-up. There was no significant difference in baseline parameters in recipients who received grafts from living and deceased donors except age (7.5 years +-2.2 vs 11.8 years +-4.1; P = .038). Rate of complications > grade II was higher among recipients of deceased donor SLKT (7.7% vs 60%; OR, 7.8; 95% CI, 1.04-58.48; P = .044). All the patients are alive with both grafts functioning. All the living donors returned to the normal life. CONCLUSION: SLKT is a safe and effective procedure for children with both simultaneous end-stage liver disease and end-stage renal disease. Both living donor partial liver and kidney transplantation and deceased donor liver-kidney transplantation can be considered as safe and feasible options.
31190059	New therapeutic options for Alport syndrome.	Alport syndrome (AS) is the most frequent inherited kidney disease after autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. It has three different patterns of inheritance-autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive and X-linked-which in part explains the wide spectrum of disease, ranging from isolated microhaematuria to end-stage renal disease early in life. The search for a treatment for AS is being pursued vigorously, not only because of the obvious unmet need but also because AS is a rare disease and any drug approved will have an orphan drug designation with its various benefits. Moreover, AS patients are quite young with very few comorbidities, which facilitates clinical trials. This review identifies the particularities of each pattern of inheritance but focuses mainly on new drugs or therapeutic targets for the disease. Most treatment-related investigations are directed not at the main abnormality in AS, namely collagen IV composition, but rather at the associated inflammation and fibrosis. Thus, AS may serve as a proof of concept for numerous drugs of potential value in many diseases that cause chronic kidney disease.
30328079	Sarcoidosis in the renal allograft of a recipient whose primary disease was autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.	We report a 55-year-old man with a renal allograft that developed sarcoidosis. His autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) progressed to end-stage stage renal disease when he was 52 years old, and he underwent living-donor kidney transplantation at the age of 53 years. His proteinuria worsened at 19 months post-transplantation, and his renal function began to decline at 29 months post-transplantation. A renal allograft biopsy performed at 31 months post-transplantation revealed non-caseating granulomatous interstitial nephritis. The patient was treated with prednisolone (0.5 mg/kg/day), with gradual reduction in the dose. His proteinuria improved and renal function did not deteriorate any further. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of sarcoidosis in a renal allograft recipient whose primary renal disease was ADPKD.
28965236	Severity of diverticulitis in patients with polycystic kidney disease without transplantation.	BACKGROUND: Patients with polycystic kidney disease (PKD) who have had a kidney transplant have an increased risk of diverticular disease and complicated diverticulitis. Literature is limited regarding the severity of diverticulitis in patients with PKD who have not had a transplant. We aim to assess whether patients with PKD, with and without renal transplant, have a similar course of diverticulitis. METHODS: A retrospective review of all adult PKD patients at our institution diagnosed with diverticulitis between 2000 and 2016 was conducted. Patients without documented PKD and diverticulitis were excluded. We compared PKD patients with and without renal transplantation. RESULTS: A total of 41 patients were identified. Mean age was 60 (+- 12), and 56% were female. Fourteen patients had undergone renal transplantation. Five (19%) non-transplant patients had complicated diverticulitis, compared to 43% (n = 6) transplanted (p = 0.33). Fifteen (56%) non-transplant and 8 (57%) transplant patients had recurrent diverticulitis (p = 1.00). Three (11%) non-transplant and 5 (36%) transplanted patients had recurrent complicated diverticulitis. Eight (30%) non-transplant and 7 (50%) transplant patients underwent surgery (p = 0.31). All 8 non-transplant patients underwent sigmoid resection with primary anastomosis without diversion. In the transplant group, 3 Hartmann procedures and 1 sigmoid resection with and 3 without diversion were performed. There was one in-hospital death in each group. CONCLUSION: In our group of patients, there was no difference in rate of recurrent diverticulitis, diverticulitis complications, or operative intervention in patients with PKD with and without renal transplant. The renal transplant group had a higher rate of recurrent, complicated diverticulitis.
25786461	Bacteremia with an iliopsoas abscess and osteomyelitis of the femoral head caused by Enterococcus avium in a patient with end-stage kidney disease.	A 70-year-old man on hemodialysis for end-stage kidney disease due to polycystic kidney disease presented with hip pain on extension and a high C-reactive protein level. Further examinations revealed an iliopsoas abscess and femoral head osteomyelitis caused by Enterococcus avium (E. avium) detected in blood and pus cultures. Complete resolution of the infection with ampicillin-resistant E. avium required six months of vancomycin therapy and two surgical drainage procedures. There have been no previous case reports in which both blood and abscess cultures confirmed E. avium infection. Careful attention should be paid to the detection of non-specific symptoms in patients on hemodialysis, with blood cultures being essential in such cases. 
34461351	Greater adherence to the dietary approaches to stop hypertension dietary pattern is associated with preserved muscle strength in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease: a single-center cross-sectional study.	The present study aimed to determine whether certain diets lower the risk of low muscle strength in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). In this cross-sectional study, outpatient ADPKD patients were enrolled from a tertiary care hospital. Muscle strength was assessed on the basis of handgrip strength (HGS), and dietary pattern indices were calculated using dietary intake data. Among the 68 participants included in this study, 19 (27.9%) had low HGS. Cystatin C concentrations were significantly higher in all participants, and in women in the low compared to the normal HGS group in the unadjusted analyses (P = 0.004). Among analyzed dietary pattern indices, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score was lower, for all participants and men, in the low compared to the normal HGS group (P < 0.05). Especially, the component score for whole grains of the DASH score was significantly lower in men in the low compared to the normal HGS group in unadjusted analyses. The DASH score was positively correlated with HGS in men (r = 0.387, P = 0.046). In addition, logistic regression analysis showed that the DASH score was negatively associated with low HGS, for all participants (odds ratio = 0.851, P = 0.049) and men (odds ratio = 0.716, P = 0.043), after adjusting for age, sex, and body weight. These findings suggest that the DASH dietary pattern may promote the preservation of muscle strength in ADPKD patients. The DASH diet can be considered as a nutritional strategy to maintain muscle strength and prevent sarcopenia in ADPKD patients.
35951255	Post-COVID-19 outcomes of non-dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease patients: a national, multicenter, controlled study.	PURPOSE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has a higher mortality in the presence of chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, there has not been much research in the literature concerning the outcomes of CKD patients in the post-COVID-19 period. We aimed to investigate the outcomes of CKD patients not receiving renal replacement therapy. METHODS: In this multicenter observational study, we included CKD patients with a GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 who survived after confirmed COVID-19. Patients with CKD whose kidney disease was due to diabetic nephropathy, polycystic kidney disease and glomerulonephritis were not included in this study. CKD patients with similar characteristics, who did not have COVID-19 were included as the control group. RESULTS: There were 173 patients in the COVID-19 group and 207 patients in the control group. Most patients (72.8%) were treated as inpatient in the COVID-19 group (intensive care unit hospitalization: 16.7%, acute kidney injury: 54.8%, needing dialysis: 7.9%). While there was no significant difference between the baseline creatinine values of the COVID-19 group and the control group (1.86 and 1.9, p = 0.978, respectively), on the 1st month, creatinine values were significantly higher in the COVID-19 group (2.09 and 1.8, respectively, p = 0.028). Respiratory system symptoms were more common in COVID-19 patients compared to the control group in the 1st month and 3rd month follow-ups (p < 0.001). Mortality at 3 months after the diagnosis of COVID-19 was significantly higher in the COVID-19 group than in the control group (respectively; 5.2% and 1.4%, p:0.037). Similarly, the rate of patients requiring dialysis for COVID-19 was significantly higher than the control group (respectively; 8.1% and 3.4%, p: 0.045). CONCLUSIONS: In CKD patients, COVID-19 was associated with increased mortality, as well as more deterioration in kidney function and higher need for dialysis in the post-COVID-19 period. These patients also had higher rate of ongoing respiratory symptoms after COVID-19.
34713484	The effect of kidney transplantation on left ventricular remodeling and global diastolic strain rate in end-stage renal disease.	BACKGROUND: Diastolic dysfunction is an early marker of cardiac pathology in end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients. The ratio of transmitral filling velocity (E) to early diastolic strain rate (E/e'sr) is a novel non-invasive marker of early left ventricular (LV) filling pressure obtained using two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography (2DSTE). METHODS: In a prospective cohort of kidney transplant (KTX) recipients with echocardiograms performed pre-transplant we obtained repeat echocardiograms at 6 months following transplant. All echocardiograms were analyzed using 2DSTE where E/e'sr and global longitudinal strain were obtained. Paired tests were used to assess changes to cardiac structure and function following KTX. RESULTS: A total of 33 patients were included in the study (mean age was 46.6 +- 13.7 years and 42% were males). The primary causes of ESKD in the cohort were glomerular disease (33%), hypertension (30%), and polycystic kidney disease (12%). The median (IQR) time spent on dialysis was 5.4 years [2.9, 7.7 years]. A reverse remodeling of the LV was observed following KTX as LV mass decreased (189.2 +- 57.5 g vs 171.1 +- 56.8 g, P = 0.014). LV filling pressure decreased as assessed by E/e'sr (103.7 +- 51.1 cm vs 72.6 +- 35.5 cm, P = 0.009). E to early diastolic mitral annular tissue velocity (E/e') did not change following KTX (9.9 +- 4.5 vs 10.3 +- 4.1, P = 0.54). Additionally, both LV internal diastolic and systolic diameter decreased significantly. CONCLUSION: Reverse cardiac remodeling following KTX was observed as improvements in LV mass and LV dimensions. LV filling pressure improved as assessed by E/e'sr decreased following KTX, whereas E/e' did not change.
31635591	Hypertension in pregnancy: A future risk for chronic kidney disease in South Africa.	BACKGROUND: Hypertension in pregnancy is a risk factor for end-stage chronic kidney disease (ESKD) and is particularly common in South Africa (SA). There are no data for the risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD). OBJECTIVES: To conduct a study of all female patients who presented to the renal replacement programme at Groote Schuur Hospital, Cape Town, SA. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of female patients with ESKD who were presented to renal replacement meetings between 2007 and 2017. For each patient who was assessed, there was a comprehensive letter detailing patient demographics, as well as psychosocial and medical history, which served as the source data. Patients with a history of hypertension in pregnancy were identified as the case group and those without the condition were the control group. Patient demographics, causes of CKD, kidney function and outcome of the meeting were documented. RESULTS: Of the 415 female patients with ESKD, 70 (16.9%) had a history of hypertension in pregnancy. The ethnic breakdown was as follows: 132 (42.44%) black, 172 (55.3%) mixed ancestry and 7 (2.25%) white. Compared with the control group, the patients were younger, with a median age of 33 v. 41 years (p<0.001), higher serum creatinine 1 045 v. 751 mumol/L (p=0.017) and lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 4.0 v. 5.1 mL/min (p=0.029). Patients were more likely to abuse methamphetamine (5.7 v. 1.7%; p=0.049), and less likely to be diabetic (1.4 v. 20.9%; p<0.001) or HIV-positive (2.9 v. 12.5%; p=0.019). There were no ethnic differences between patients and controls. Underlying causes of renal disease showed significant differences, as patients were more likely to have hypertensive nephropathy (57.1 v. 22.9%; p<0.0001), and less likely to have diabetic kidney disease (1.4 v. 20.4%; p<0.001), HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) (1.4 v. 6.4%) or polycystic kidney disease (1.4 v. 7.0%). There was no difference in acceptance to the dialysis and transplant programme (53 v. 47%). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests an important link between hypertension in pregnancy and ESKD. The patients were significantly younger, presented later and were more likely to have hypertensive nephropathy. Methamphetamine abuse appears to be a risk factor. The study suggests that all women with hypertensive disorders during pregnancy need further evaluation and follow-up postpartum.
31005868	Splenic artery aneurysm in a patient of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease: beyond tenuous concomitance!	Splenic artery aneurysm (SAA) is rare, with risk of rupture especially if diameter is >2 cm. It is usually asymptomatic and detected incidentally on imaging either in young pregnant women or elderly cirrhotic patients. Extracranial vascular abnormalities known to be associated with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) include ascending aortic aneurysms, dissections of coronary and vertebral arteries and rarely SAA. We describe a rare case of incidentally detected SAA in a patient with end stage renal disease due to ADPKD during evaluation of persistent gross haematuria, with no evidence of cranial or other extracranial aneurysms.
27730435	Epigenetic Regulation in Cystogenesis.	Epigenetic regulation refers to heritable changes in gene expression that do not involve any alteration of the DNA sequence. DNA methylation, histone modification, and gene regulation by microRNAs are well-known epigenetic modulations that are closely associated with several cellular processes and diverse disease states, such as cancers, even under precancerous conditions. More recently, several studies have indicated that epigenetic changes may be associated with renal cystic diseases, including autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, and the restoration of altered epigenetic factors may become a therapeutic target of renal cystic disease and would be expected to have minimal side effects. This review focuses on recently reported findings on epigenetic and considers the potential of targeting epigenetic regulation as a novel therapeutic approach to control cystogenesis.
30120380	Metabolism and mitochondria in polycystic kidney disease research and therapy.	Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is one of the most common, potentially lethal, monogenic diseases and is caused predominantly by mutations in polycystic kidney disease 1 (PKD1) and PKD2, which encode polycystin 1 (PC1) and PC2, respectively. Over the decades-long course of the disease, patients develop large fluid-filled renal cysts that impair kidney function, leading to end-stage renal disease in ~50% of patients. Despite the identification of numerous dysregulated pathways in ADPKD, the molecular mechanisms underlying the renal dysfunction from mutations in PKD genes and the physiological functions of the polycystin proteins are still unclear. Alterations in cell metabolism have emerged in the past decade as a hallmark of ADPKD. ADPKD cells shift their mode of energy production from oxidative phosphorylation to alternative pathways, such as glycolysis. In addition, the polycystins seem to play regulatory roles in modulating mechanisms and machinery related to energy production and utilization, including AMPK, PPARalpha, PGC1alpha, calcium signalling at mitochondria-associated membranes, mTORC1, cAMP and CFTR-mediated ion transport as well as the expression of crucial components of the mitochondrial energy production apparatus. In this Review, we explore these metabolic changes and discuss in detail the relationship between energy metabolism and ADPKD pathogenesis and identify potential therapeutic targets.
30552649	Surgical outcomes of acute type A aortic dissection in dialysis patients.	BACKGROUND: Acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) is relatively uncommon in dialysis patients, and characteristics and repair outcomes are not fully understood. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with ATAAD (n = 960) were divided into a dialysis group (n = 19) and non-dialysis group (n = 941), depending on whether they required dialysis for preoperative end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Hospital charts and imaging data were reviewed, and characteristics and outcomes were compared between the groups. Segmental aortic wall or intima/media flap calcification in the thoracic and abdominal aorta was assessed in the dialysis patients. RESULTS: The leading primary causes of ESRD were polycystic kidney disease (n = 5) and chronic glomerulonephritis (n = 5). There were no significant differences (dialysis group vs. non-dialysis group) in age (60.5 vs. 64.5 years), preoperative hemodynamics, or organ ischemia. Dialysis patients were more likely to have an entry tear in the aortic arch (42% vs. 15%, p = 0.003). These patients showed moderate-to-severe calcification (multiple focal or single focal calcification > 10 mm) in the ascending aorta (17%), aortic arch (61%), descending aorta (67%), and abdominal aorta (83%). Arch replacement was common in this group (37% vs. 18%, p = 0.030). Although in-hospital mortality was increased in this group (21% vs. 7%, p = 0.059), morbidities did not differ significantly. Six-year survival was 60.3 +- 13.4% and 78.8 +- 1.6%, respectively (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Dialysis patients tend to have aortic calcification and a primary tear in the aortic arch. Outcomes are acceptable.
27320369	Is peritoneal dialysis a therapeutic option for polycystic kidney disease? 15 years' experience in a single center.	BACKGROUND: Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is often avoided for patients with polycystic kidney disease (PKD) because of increased risk of complications and technique failure due to limited intra-abdominal space. In this study, we have aimed to determine clinical outcomes, patient and technique survivals in patients with PKD performing PD and to define whether PD is appropriate for these patients. METHODS: Totally 99 patients: 33 with PKD and 66 with diseases other than PKD were included in this retrospective study. All patients started PD between 2001 and 2015 years and have been matched by time of PD therapy initiation. Socio-demographic characteristics, clinical data and complications during the specified period were evaluated. The factors associated with mortality and patient and technique survival were investigated for all patients. RESULTS: The two groups were similar in terms of demographic, baseline and last visit clinical and laboratory parameters, additional systemic diseases, with the exception of higher pretreatment and last visit serum albumin levels in PKD patients (P=0.03 and 0.01 respectively) and younger age of non-PKD patients (P=0.002). Incidence of peritonitis and catheter exit-site/tunnel infections were similar among the two groups (P=0.26 and 0.12 respectively). The two groups were similar in terms of leak and hernia developments (P=0.07 and 0.57, respectively). By the end of the study period; in PKD group, 10 patients had been transferred to HD and had kidney transplantation and only 6 patients had died. In non-PKD group, 19 patients had been transferred to HD, 11 patients had kidney transplantation and 23 patients had died. Mortality was lower in PKD group (log rank=0.034). The two groups were similar regarding death and HD transfer reasons (P=0.35 and 0.36 respectively). The technique survival rates were similar among the two groups (log rank=0.37). CONCLUSIONS: Peritoneal dialysis may be a suitable renal replacement therapy option for PKD patients. PKD is not an additional risk factor in patients treated by PD. Mortality is similar with non-diabetic PD patients. Peritoneal dialysis in PKD patients is associated with a similar overall rate of technique survival, incidences of hernia, leak and infectious complications as in non-PKD patients.
28799891	External Iliac Artery Dissection During Kidney Transplant for Polycystic Kidney Disease: A Caveat for Surgeons.	Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is a common cause of end-stage renal failure and an indication for transplant. The genetic mutation in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease also causes vascular abnormalities, mainly aneurysms but also medial dissection. Here, a case of dissection of the recipient artery during a kidney transplant procedure in a patient with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is described. Dissection caused occlusion of both the external iliac artery and the donor renal artery. Occlusion was recognized intraoperatively, and the kidney was salvaged by in situ reperfusion of the kidney with cold preservation solution, excision of the affected recipient arterial segment, and reanastomosis of the donor artery to the internal iliac artery. The external iliac artery defect was replaced with a saphenous vein interposition graft. The transplanted kidney achieved good function. This is the first description of a case of recognition of recipient arterial dissection during a kidney transplant procedure for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Surgeons should be aware of the phenomenon of arterial dissection in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and should be vigilant while anastomosing the artery during kidney transplant in these patients.
39101420	Autoptic aspects in a case of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.	Background: Polycystic kidney disease is a cystic genetic disease. There are two forms: an autosomal dominant one, more common and typical of adults, and an autosomal recessive one, rarer and present in childhood. The autosomal dominant form is caused by genetic mutations of the PKD1 gene in 85% of cases and of PKD2 in 10-15% of cases. Case Report: We reported a case of 56-year-old woman with ADPKD, who had a kidney transplant and who was hospitalized for respiratory failure from Covid 19 disease. She was intubated, sedated and dialyzed, treated with antibiotics, immunosuppressants, diuretics and heparin. CT scan of the abdomen showed multiple cysts of various sizes in the liver and multiple cysts in the kidneys. The patient died after 20 days because she was unresponsive to therapy. The autopsy showed milky ascitic fluid in the abdomen, massive gastric haemor-rhage, intestinal fungal plaques, hepatic and renal polycystosis. The kidneys measured a total of 27 cm with a total weight of about 9 kg. The liver parenchyma appeared cavernous with multiple cysts. The kidney cysts contained bloody liquid. Conclusions: The case demonstrates how important it is in these subjects to evaluate not only the kidneys but also the liver which could present polycystosis and cause liver failure, affecting the severity of the pathology and death. This data is important to emphasize in the clinical management of these patients a close monitoring of liver function also from a preventative perspective in life.
26092830	Patient characteristics and outcomes by GN subtype in ESRD.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Outcomes-based research rarely focuses on patients with ESRD caused by GN. The hypotheses were that the GN subtype would clinically discriminate patient groups and independently associate with survival after ESRD therapy initiation. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Data were extracted from the US Renal Data System for adult patients with incident (1996-2011) ESRD attributed to six GN subtypes: FSGS, IgA nephropathy (IgAN), membranous nephropathy, membranoproliferative glomeruonephritis, lupus nephritis (LN), and vasculitis. ESRD attributed to diabetes and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease served as non-GN comparators. Unadjusted and adjusted mortality hazard ratios (aHRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated using Cox regression (reference, IgAN). Models sequentially adjusted for sociodemographic (model 2), comorbidity/laboratory (model 3), and ESRD treatment modality (model 4) variables. RESULTS: Among 84,301 patients with ESRD attributed to GN, the median age ranged from 39 (LN) to 66 (vasculitis) years, male sex ranged from 18% (LN) to 68% (IgAN), and black race ranged from 7% (IgAN) to 49% (LN). Patients with IgAN had the fewest comorbidities and lowest use of hemodialysis (70.1%). After a median follow-up of 2.5 (interquartile range, 1.0-4.9) years, crude mortality was lowest in IgAN (3.7 deaths/100 person years). Compared to IgAN, adjusted mortality was highest in LN (model 4 aHR=1.75; 95% CI, 1.68 to 1.83) and in diabetes (aHR=1.73; 95% CI, 1.67 to 1.79), and was also higher in all other GN subtypes (membranous nephropathy: aHR=1.23; 95% CI, 1.17 to 1.29; FSGS: aHR=1.37; 95% CI, 1.32 to 1.42; membranoproliferative GN: aHR=1.38; 95% CI, 1.31 to 1.45; vasculitis: aHR=1.51; 95% CI, 1.45 to 1.58) and in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (aHR=1.22; 95% CI, 1.18 to 1.27). CONCLUSIONS: This study exposes substantial heterogeneity across GN subtypes at ESRD therapy initiation and identifies independent associations between GN subtype and post-ESRD mortality. These survival discrepancies warrant further study, and the utility of current research practice to group GN subtypes together when evaluating ESRD outcomes should be questioned.
36524891	Combined Liver-Kidney Transplant for Juvenile Polycystic Kidney Disease and Concomitant Hereditary Factor V Deficiency.	Factor V deficiency is a congenital bleeding diathesis that, in selected cases, may be managed with liver transplant. In this case, we describe the treatment of an adult patient with kidney failure secondary to juvenile onset polycystic kidney disease who received a combined liver-kidney transplant as a method to manage the risks associated with the need for a kidney transplantin the setting of factorV deficiency and high sensitization.
27796021	[Renal transplantation in Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD)].	Transplantation is the optimal choice for renal replacement therapy in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). However, some specific issues should be addressed before transplantation, including nephrectomy of native kidneys, cystic liver involvement, screening for intracranial aneurysms and living related-donor transplantation. After kidney transplantation, patient and graft survival rates are excellent and the size of native kidneys typically declines. Nevertheless, a number of renal and extrarenal complications have been documented in kidney transplant recipients with ADPKD. In particular, renal cyst infections may occur in patients who did not undergo pretransplant nephrectomy. Moreover, an increased risk in new-onset diabetes mellitus and non-melanoma skin cancer has been reported, even though recent studies challenged these findings. In patients with ADPKD who did not undergo preventive nephrectomy, the risk of malignancy in native kidneys after renal transplantation is comparable to that reported in patients with other nephropathies. There is no evidence supporting the preferential use of mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors as immunosuppressive drugs in transplant recipients with ADPKD.

31542066	Grover's Disease in a Kidney Transplant Recipient.	"Dear Editor, It is not unusual for patients with renal insufficiency to develop skin pathologies. There are reports in the literature of increased incidence of calciphylaxis, pruritus, perforating dermatoses, and porphyria cutanea tarda in this patient population (1). Although it is quite rare, Grover's disease (GD) has been reported in several patients with renal insufficiency, but only once in a renal transplant recipient (2). The disease follows three patterns: persistently pruritic, transient eruptive, or a chronic asymptomatic course (3). Common risk factors concomitant with disease prevalence are immunosuppression, HIV, hemodialysis, viral and bacterial infections, malignancies, and other skin pathologies like contact and atopic dermatitis (4). A 60-year-old woman had a family history of polycystic kidney disease and was subsequently diagnosed in 1997. The patient had concomitant hepatic involvement and a stable aneurysm of the anterior cerebral artery. Consequently, the patient preemptively received a kidney transplant in 2015. The immunosuppressive therapy consisted of tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisone with basiliximab induction. In 2017, a biopsy of the right thigh demonstrated squamous cell carcinoma in situ measuring 1x1cm in size. The lesion was treated with surgical excision. The patient also exhibited an erythematous brown macule with undefined borders on the left side of the nose with a size of 12 mm; it was later determined to be actinic keratosis. The lesion was treated successfully with cryotherapy. During this period, a fever prompted a PCR for BK virus DNA which showed a substantial amount of copies, measuring 28,850 copies/mL in urine and 98 copies/mL in blood. The mycophenolate dose was reduced, and tacrolimus trough concentration was maintained at between 3 and 5 microg/L. In 2018 the patient presented with multiple pruritic erythematous papules located on the trunk. Upon histological biopsy, there was dominant suprabasal acantholysis with numerous cells separating from the epithelium. Furthermore, there was a moderate amount of mononuclear infiltrate in the upper portion of the dermis and sparse suprabasal clefts (Figure 1). Clinical presentation and histologic examination were consistent with Grover's disease. The patient was treated topically with betamethasone cream twice daily for four weeks. The skin changes persisted for only a few weeks. The pathophysiological mechanism causing GD is still unknown. It is usually only a transient skin condition that lasts no more than a few weeks, but there have been more chronic cases lasting for years, particularly in patients on hemodialysis (5). The lesions commonly affect the chest area but may spread to diffusely envelope the body as erythematous papules, pustules, lichenoid lesions, or vesicles (2). Grover characterized 4 different subtypes based on the pathohistological findings as Darier-like (the most common), pemphigus vulgaris-like, Hailey-Hailey-like, or spongiotic subtype (3). The histological patterns are not exclusive to one patient and may even be found concomitantly in a single lesion. The condition is definitively diagnosed through histology, showing distinctive acantholysis along the epidermis with dyskeratosis that is described as ""corps ronds"" and ""grains"" (3). Grover's disease is more prevalent in middle-aged Caucasian men than any other group, with a 1.6-2.1 gender ratio (6). It was originally thought that the disease was caused by dysfunctional eccrine sweat glands, as the ailment was more common in patients that had increased perspiration either due to environmental heat, fever, or extensive bedrest. This idea was reinforced by histological evidence of atrophied sweat glands in uremic patients with renal insufficiency (7). Moreover, a case series and case report described remissions of GD in their patients on hemodialysis that received a renal transplant (5,8). However, subsequent studies have not supported an association with sweat dysfunction and disease development, while others have only managed to attribute sweat gland dysfunction as the primary trigger in 20-30% of cases (9). Conversely, cold dry air and xerosis cutis is thought to trigger the disease because it is four times more likely to be diagnosed in the winter months (10). Ultraviolet radiation has been identified as an exacerbating factor for GD, which could have been the trigger for onset of disease in our patient as demonstrated by her squamous cell carcinoma and actinic keratosis (11). Despite immunosuppression being a risk factor for GD, as shown by its association in patients with HIV, bone marrow transplantation, hemodialysis, and hematological malignancies, GD has been reported only once in the literature after a renal transplant (2,4). As our case, that patient developed GD a few years after transplant without an obvious trigger and the lesions appeared as red papules that were disseminated over the anterior thorax. Their patient's cutaneous lesion resolved spontaneously after 2 weeks and never returned in the 2.5-year follow-up period. Their patient has had two renal allografts over a 20 year timespan, while ours had had her graft for only two years. The immunosuppressive regimen was slightly different: cyclosporine, azathioprine, and methylprednisolone versus our combination of tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisone. Grover's disease can be treated conservatively by avoiding risk factors such as UV light and sweating as well as and applying moisturizing emollients which may cause the lesion to resolve spontaneously. Medical therapy consists of topic corticosteroids, topical vitamin D analogues, oral retinoids, and oral corticosteroids, PUVA, and methotrexate for resistant cases (6,12). When a patient exhibits pruritic papules of the skin, GD should be considered in differential diagnosis, especially in kidney transplant patients and those on hemodialysis. While the condition is rare, increased recognition in this patient population will allow for studies to further characterize this poorly understood disease."
34390271	The relationship between hepatic fibrosis and arterial stiffness in hemodialysis patients.	INTRODUCTION: The main cause of death in hemodialysis patients is cardiovascular diseases. Increased arterial stiffness is a predictor of cardiovascular events for hemodialysis patients. Among the nondialysis patient population, arterial stiffness increases in those with hepatic fibrosis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. This study aims to examine the relationship between hepatic fibrosis and arterial stiffness in hemodialysis patients for the first time in the literature. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The study includes chronic hemodialysis patients over 18 years of age who had been treated for hemodialysis for at least 6 months. Patients with chronic liver disease, chronic viral hepatitis (HBV and HCV), alcohol use, or liver disease accompanied by polycystic kidney disease and active infection were excluded. Hepatic fibrosis scores were measured using the FibroScan device. Single-cuff Mobil-o-Graph was used for measurement of arterial stiffness. RESULTS: Fifty-nine patients were enrolled; 54.2% of the patients were male, and the mean age was 53.9 +- 12.9 years. Thirty-nine percent of the patients had diabetes. Average pulse wave velocity (PWV) value of the patients was 8.3 +- 1.6 m/s, and it had positive correlation with age, CAP score, fibrosis score, and body mass index and showed negative correlation to albumin. It was seen that the patients with a PWV value >= 10 m/s have significantly higher CAP score compared with the patients with a PWV < 10 m/s. When the factors predicting PWV were examined in the regression analysis, age and systolic blood pressure were found to be determinants. CONCLUSION: Increased hepatic fibrosis in hemodialysis patients is associated with increased arterial stiffness, but this relationship is not independent.
32507635	Early nephrectomy in neonates with symptomatic autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease.	INTRODUCTION: Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) is a rare cause of renal failure with a highly variable clinical course. Patients who are symptomatic early in life frequently require early nephrectomy and peritoneal dialysis. In these patients there are little data to guide clinicians on whether to select unilateral nephrectomy or bilateral nephrectomy at the initial operative intervention. We review our experience with this disease process. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of 11 patients at our institution with ARPKD symptomatic within the first month of life. Charts were reviewed for relevant clinical data, and patients were divided into groups based on undergoing either unilateral or bilateral nephrectomy at their initial intervention. The decision for unilateral versus bilateral nephrectomy was decided by the clinical team without any available guidelines. RESULTS: Of the 11 patients reviewed, two patients died within the first two weeks from other complications. The remaining 9 all required nephrectomy, with 5 undergoing synchronous bilateral nephrectomy, and 4 undergoing initial unilateral nephrectomy. All four patients required removal of their contralateral kidney, a median of 25.5 days later. There was no difference in mortality, ventilator free days, or time to full feeds between the two groups, although the group undergoing initial unilateral nephrectomy had more TPN days than their counterparts (28 vs 17 days, p = 0.014). CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort, there were few significant differences between the groups based on choice of initial unilateral or bilateral nephrectomy, and all children ultimately required removal of both kidneys. These data suggest that anesthetic exposures and other clinical outcomes might be optimized by initial bilateral nephrectomy. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III.
27746440	Recurrent Cholangitis in a Patient with Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) and Caroli's Disease.	We herein present a rare case of an autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) patient with Caroli's disease, a congenital embryonic biliary tree ductal plate abnormality often associated with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease. A 76-year-old woman with ADPKD on hemodialysis was admitted to our hospital with recurrent cholangitis and hepatobiliary stones. Caroli's disease was diagnosed according to typical imaging findings of cystic intrahepatic bile duct dilatation and the central dot sign. Hepatobiliary system abnormalities such as Caroli's disease should be considered in febrile ADPKD patients, even in the absence of typical clinical signs or symptoms.
32128974	Individualized concept for the treatment of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease with end-stage renal disease.	Management of children with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) who develop end-stage renal disease (ESRD) remains challenging because of concomitant liver disease. Patients with recurrent cholangitis are candidates for liver-kidney transplantation, while the treatment for patients with splenomegaly and pancytopenia due to portal hypertension is controversial. Herein, we report 7 children who were treated using an individualized treatment strategy stratified by liver disease. Two patients with recurrent cholangitis underwent sequential liver-kidney transplantation, while 4 patients with splenomegaly and pancytopenia but without recurrent cholangitis underwent splenectomy followed by isolated kidney transplantation. The remaining patient, who did not have cholangitis and pancytopenia, underwent isolated kidney transplantation. Blood cell counts were normalized after splenectomy was performed at the median age of 8.7 (range, 7.4-11.7) years. Kidney transplantation was performed at the median age of 8.8 (range, 1.9-14.7) years in all patients. Overwhelming post-splenectomy infections and cholangitis did not occur during the median follow-up period of 6.3 (range, 1.0-13.2) years. The estimated glomerular filtration rate at the last follow-up was 53 (range, 35-107) mL/min/1.73 m2 . No graft loss occurred. Our individualized treatment strategy stratified by recurrent cholangitis and pancytopenia can be a feasible strategy for children with ARPKD who develop ESRD and warrants further evaluation.
32851809	Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics, Safety, and Tolerability of Oral Venglustat in Healthy Volunteers.	Venglustat is a small-molecule glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) inhibitor designed to reduce the production of glucosylceramide (GL-1) and thus is expected to substantially reduce formation of glucosylceramide-based glycosphingolipids. Because of its effect on glycosphingolipid formation, GCS inhibition has therapeutic potential across many disorders affecting glycosphingolipid metabolism. Therefore, venglustat is under development for substrate reduction therapy in multiple diseases, including Gaucher disease type 3, Parkinson's disease associated with GBA mutations, Fabry disease, GM2 gangliosidosis, and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Phase 1 studies were conducted in healthy volunteers to determine venglustat pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, and tolerability and to assess food effects on pharmacokinetics (single-dose and food-effect studies: NCT01674036; repeated-dose study: NCT01710826). Following a single oral dose of venglustat l-malate (2, 5, 15, 25, 50, 100, or 150 mg), venglustat demonstrated linear pharmacokinetics, rapid absorption (median tmax , 3.00-5.50 hours), systemic exposure unaffected by food, low apparent total body clearance (mean CL/F, 5.18-6.43 L/h), and pooled geometric mean t1/2z of 28.9 hours. Following repeated once-daily oral doses of venglustat l-malate (5, 10, or 20 mg) for 14 days, apparent steady state occurred within 5 days of repeated dosing, with pooled accumulation ratios of 2.10 for Cmax and 2.22 for AUC0-24 , and no statistically significant effect of dose or sex on accumulation. The mean fraction of dose excreted unchanged in urine (fe0-24 ) was 26.3% to 33.1%. Plasma GL-1 and GM3 decreased time- and dose-dependently. Venglustat demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile.
27432742	Kidney Transplantation Outcomes across GN Subtypes in the United States.	Differences in kidney transplantation outcomes across GN subtypes have rarely been studied. From the US Renal Data System, we identified all adult (>=18 years) first kidney transplant recipients (1996-2011) with ESRD attributed to one of six GN subtypes or two comparator kidney diseases. We computed hazard ratios (HRs) for death, all-cause allograft failure, and allograft failure excluding death as a cause (competing risks framework) using Cox proportional hazards regression. Among the 32,131 patients with GN studied, patients with IgA nephropathy (IgAN) had the lowest mortality rates and patients with IgAN or vasculitis had the lowest allograft failure rates. After adjusting for patient- and transplant-related factors, compared with IgAN (referent), FSGS, membranous nephropathy, membranoproliferative GN, lupus nephritis, and vasculitis associated with HRs (95% confidence intervals) for death of 1.57 (1.43 to 1.72), 1.52 (1.34 to 1.72), 1.76 (1.55 to 2.01), 1.82 (1.63 to 2.02), and 1.56 (1.34 to 1.81), respectively, and with HRs for allograft failure excluding death as a cause of 1.20 (1.12 to 1.28), 1.27 (1.14 to 1.41), 1.50 (1.36 to 1.66), 1.11 (1.02 to 1.20), and 0.94 (0.81 to 1.09), respectively. Considering external comparator groups, and comparing with IgAN, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) and diabetic nephropathy associated with higher HRs for mortality [1.22 (1.12 to 1.34) and 2.57 (2.35 to 2.82), respectively], but ADPKD associated with a lower HR for allograft failure excluding death as a cause [0.85 (0.79 to 0.91)]. Reasons for differential outcomes by GN subtype and cause of ESRD should be examined in future research.
31563146	Kidney transplantation from an HIV-positive cadaveric donor.	Kidney transplantation is the gold-standard therapy for select HIV-positive patients with ESRD. Since the Italian Ministry of Health defined the guidelines for organ donation from HIV-positive persons in 2018, we report the first case of renal transplantation from an HIV-positive cadaveric donor in two HIV-positive recipients in Italy. The donor was a 50-year-old male, deceased due to post-anoxic encephalopathy, with a history of HIV infection in HAART, undetectable viral load, and HCV-related chronic hepatitis that had been previously treated. The first recipient was a 59-year-old female with a prior history of drug addiction, and she suffered from ESRD secondary to HIV nephropathy. The patient followed preoperative HAART with a good viral response and undetectable HIV viral load. She also had a history of HCV-related chronic hepatitis that had been successfully treated. The right kidney was uneventfully transplanted. The patient developed an asymptomatic reinfection of endogenous BK virus. The second recipient was a 41-year-old male with ESRD secondary to polycystic kidney disease. The patient was HIV-positive in HAART, with a good viro-immunologic response and an undetectable HIV viral load. He suffered from a severe form of hemophilia A and HCV-related chronic hepatitis, which had been previously treated with undetectable HCV RNA. The left kidney was uneventfully transplanted. At the end of follow-up, both patients had a healthy condition with stable renal function, a persistently good viral response and undetectable HIV and HCV viral loads. These encouraging preliminary results seem to confirm the safety and effectiveness of kidney transplantation from select HIV-positive donors.
26900155	The Treatment of Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease.	BACKGROUND: About one in 2000 persons in Europe suffers from autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). The treatment of this disease up to the present has been limited to the management of complications. METHODS: This review is based on pertinent publications, mostly of the last three years, that were retrieved by a selective search in PubMed. RESULTS: Kidney volume is probably the most important predictive factor for the loss of renal function. A measurement of kidney size is, therefore, recommended as soon as the diagnosis is made. ADPKD patients under age 30 with a combined kidney volume above 1500 mL and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 90 mL/min are at high risk of needing kidney-replacement therapy (dialysis or transplantation) within 20 years, even if their renal function is normal. Ultrasonographic follow-up can identify affected persons whose risk for rapid progression is especially high. Currently available evidence reveals that, in patients at risk whose renal function is normal, the maintenance of blood pressure at or below a target value of 110/75 mmHg lessens renal enlargement, albuminuria, and left-ventricular hypertrophy. In another study, the treatment of selected patients with tolvaptan, a vasopressin-2 receptor (V2R) blocker, was found to delay cyst enlargement and the related decline in renal function for three years. It is unclear, however, how long the effect of tolvaptan persists, or whether persons whose renal function is already impaired can benefit from it. The main side effects are marked polyuria and, in rare cases, liver toxicity. CONCLUSION: In patients with ADPKD, an effort should be made to keep the arterial blood pressure below 120/80 mmHg. In patients at high risk of progression whose renal function is still intact (eGFR > 60 mL/min), strict blood pressure control (< 110/75 mm Hg) is indicated, and possibly V2R blockade with tolvaptan as well. Tolvaptan is an expensive drug, and patients taking it must be carefully monitored for hepatotoxicity.
27577987	Novel association of familial testicular germ cell tumor and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease with PKD1 mutation.	Adolescent brothers were diagnosed with testicular germ cell tumors within the same month. Both were found to have multiple renal cysts on pretreatment imaging done for staging. The proband, his brother, and their mother, were all found to have a novel splice variant in intron 8 of the PKD1 gene by clinical exome sequencing. This is the second family reported with both familial testicular germ cell tumor (FTGCT) and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), and the first described association of FTGCT with a splice variant in PKD1. We suggest that this novel variant in PKD1 may convey increased risk for FTGCT in addition to causing ADPKD.
30951521	Octreotide-LAR in later-stage autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ALADIN 2): A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial.	BACKGROUND: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most frequent genetically determined renal disease. In affected patients, renal function may progressively decline up to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and approximately 10% of those with ESRD are affected by ADPKD. The somatostatin analog octreotide long-acting release (octreotide-LAR) slows renal function deterioration in patients in early stages of the disease. We evaluated the renoprotective effect of octreotide-LAR in ADPKD patients at high risk of ESRD because of later-stage ADPKD. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We did an internally funded, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trial to assess octreotide-LAR in adults with ADPKD with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 15-40 ml/min/1.73 m2. Participants were randomized to receive 2 intramuscular injections of 20 mg octreotide-LAR (n = 51) or 0.9% sodium chloride solution (placebo; n = 49) every 28 days for 3 years. Central randomization was 1:1 using a computerized list stratified by center and presence or absence of diabetes or proteinuria. Co-primary short- and long-term outcomes were 1-year total kidney volume (TKV) (computed tomography scan) growth and 3-year GFR (iohexol plasma clearance) decline. Analyses were by modified intention-to-treat. Patients were recruited from 4 Italian nephrology units between October 11, 2011, and March 20, 2014, and followed up to April 14, 2017. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. Compared to placebo, octreotide-LAR reduced median (95% CI) TKV growth from baseline by 96.8 (10.8 to 182.7) ml at 1 year (p = 0.027) and 422.6 (150.3 to 695.0) ml at 3 years (p = 0.002). Reduction in the median (95% CI) rate of GFR decline (0.56 [-0.63 to 1.75] ml/min/1.73 m2 per year) was not significant (p = 0.295). TKV analyses were adjusted for age, sex, and baseline TKV. Over a median (IQR) 36 (24 to 37) months of follow-up, 9 patients on octreotide-LAR and 21 patients on placebo progressed to a doubling of serum creatinine or ESRD (composite endpoint) (hazard ratio [HR] [95% CI] adjusted for age, sex, baseline serum creatinine, and baseline TKV: 0.307 [0.127 to 0.742], p = 0.009). One composite endpoint was prevented for every 4 treated patients. Among 63 patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 4, 3 on octreotide-LAR and 8 on placebo progressed to ESRD (adjusted HR [95% CI]: 0.121 [0.017 to 0.866], p = 0.036). Three patients on placebo had a serious renal cyst rupture/infection and 1 patient had a serious urinary tract infection/obstruction, versus 1 patient on octreotide-LAR with a serious renal cyst infection. The main study limitation was the small sample size. CONCLUSIONS: In this study we observed that in later-stage ADPKD, octreotide-LAR slowed kidney growth and delayed progression to ESRD, in particular in CKD stage 4. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01377246; EudraCT: 2011-000138-12.
25118046	Four pediatric patients with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease developed new-onset diabetes after renal transplantation.	NODAT is increasingly prevalent. Compared with adult recipients, NODAT is less prevalent in pediatric renal transplant recipients; however, some risk factors for its development in young patients have been defined. We report four pediatric renal transplant recipients with ARPKD who developed NODAT. We review the current pediatric NODAT literature and hypothesize that ARPKD may be an additional risk factor for NODAT. 
37247754	Extended monitoring of re-coiled cerebral aneurysms after initial postcoiling recanalization: Safety and durability of repeat coil embolization.	PURPOSE: In the endovascular era, postcoiling recanalization of cerebral aneurysms is occurring with greater frequency. Repeat coiling is usually done to prevent rebleeding, although long-term outcomes of re-embolization have yet to be adequately investigated. The present study was undertaken to assess clinical and radiographic outcomes of re-embolization in recanalized aneurysms, focusing on procedural safety, efficacy, and durability. METHOD: In this retrospective review, we examined 308 patients with 310 recurrent aneurysms. All lesions were re-coiled, once major recanalization (after initial coil embolization) was established. Medical records and radiologic data amassed during extended follow-up were then subject to review. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was undertaken to identify risk factors for subsequent recurrence. RESULT: During a lengthy follow-up (mean, 40.2 +- 33.0 months), major recanalization developed again in 87 aneurysms (28.1%). Multivariable Cox regression analysis linked re-recanalization to initial saccular neck width (p=.003) and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD; p<.001). Stent implantation (p=.038) and successful occlusion at second coiling (p=.012) were protective against later recanalization in this setting. The more recent the second embolization was performed, the lower the risk of further recurrence (p=.023). Procedure-related complications included asymptomatic thromboembolism (n = 9), transient ischemic neurologic deficits (n = 2), procedural bleeding (n = 1), and coil migration (n = 1), but there were no residual effects or deaths. CONCLUSION: Repeat coil embolization is a safe therapeutic option for recanalized cerebral aneurysms. Wide-necked status and ADPKD emerged as risks for subsequent recanalization, whereas successful occlusion and stent implantation seemed to reduce the likelihood of recurrence after re-embolization procedures.
25399733	Blood pressure in early autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.	BACKGROUND: Hypertension is common in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) and is associated with increased total kidney volume, activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and progression of kidney disease. METHODS: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we randomly assigned 558 hypertensive participants with ADPKD (15 to 49 years of age, with an estimated glomerular filtration rate [GFR] >60 ml per minute per 1.73 m(2) of body-surface area) to either a standard blood-pressure target (120/70 to 130/80 mm Hg) or a low blood-pressure target (95/60 to 110/75 mm Hg) and to either an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (lisinopril) plus an angiotensin-receptor blocker (telmisartan) or lisinopril plus placebo. The primary outcome was the annual percentage change in the total kidney volume. RESULTS: The annual percentage increase in total kidney volume was significantly lower in the low-blood-pressure group than in the standard-blood-pressure group (5.6% vs. 6.6%, P=0.006), without significant differences between the lisinopril-telmisartan group and the lisinopril-placebo group. The rate of change in estimated GFR was similar in the two medication groups, with a negative slope difference in the short term in the low-blood-pressure group as compared with the standard-blood-pressure group (P<0.001) and a marginally positive slope difference in the long term (P=0.05). The left-ventricular-mass index decreased more in the low-blood-pressure group than in the standard-blood-pressure group (-1.17 vs. -0.57 g per square meter per year, P<0.001); urinary albumin excretion was reduced by 3.77% with the low-pressure target and increased by 2.43% with the standard target (P<0.001). Dizziness and light-headedness were more common in the low-blood-pressure group than in the standard-blood-pressure group (80.7% vs. 69.4%, P=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: In early ADPKD, the combination of lisinopril and telmisartan did not significantly alter the rate of increase in total kidney volume. As compared with standard blood-pressure control, rigorous blood-pressure control was associated with a slower increase in total kidney volume, no overall change in the estimated GFR, a greater decline in the left-ventricular-mass index, and greater reduction in urinary albumin excretion.

30642276	Bilateral renal artery stenosis as a cause of refractory intradialytic hypertension in a patient with end stage renal disease.	BACKGROUND: We report a 61-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to polycystic kidney disease (PKD) complicated by intradialytic hypertension (IDH). Increased sympathetic drive leading to increased stroke volume and/or vasoconstriction with an inappropriate increase in peripheral vascular resistance (PVR) has been postulated to be the cause of IDH. CASE PRESENTATION: Attempts to control her blood pressure by reducing her goal weight; increasing dialysis times/ frequency and decreasing her sodium concentrate in the dialysis fluid were unsuccessful. Acting upon literature evidence suggesting renovascular disease as a cause of IDH, we referred her to an interventional radiologist for evaluation of the renal arteries. Selective angiogram of both renal arteries revealed right sided atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (RAS) treated with insertion of a balloon mounted 6 mm stent and left sided fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) treated with 5 mm balloon angioplasty. CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the need for interrogating the renal arteries radiologically for a potential cause in difficult to control IDH and comments on the association between PKD and FMD that has not yet been reported.
31118499	International consensus statement on the diagnosis and management of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease in children and young people.	These recommendations were systematically developed on behalf of the Network for Early Onset Cystic Kidney Disease (NEOCYST) by an international group of experts in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) from paediatric and adult nephrology, human genetics, paediatric radiology and ethics specialties together with patient representatives. They have been endorsed by the International Pediatric Nephrology Association (IPNA) and the European Society of Paediatric Nephrology (ESPN). For asymptomatic minors at risk of ADPKD, ongoing surveillance (repeated screening for treatable disease manifestations without diagnostic testing) or immediate diagnostic screening are equally valid clinical approaches. Ultrasonography is the current radiological method of choice for screening. Sonographic detection of one or more cysts in an at-risk child is highly suggestive of ADPKD, but a negative scan cannot rule out ADPKD in childhood. Genetic testing is recommended for infants with very-early-onset symptomatic disease and for children with a negative family history and progressive disease. Children with a positive family history and either confirmed or unknown disease status should be monitored for hypertension (preferably by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring) and albuminuria. Currently, vasopressin antagonists should not be offered routinely but off-label use can be considered in selected children. No consensus was reached on the use of statins, but mTOR inhibitors and somatostatin analogues are not recommended. Children with ADPKD should be strongly encouraged to achieve the low dietary salt intake that is recommended for all children.
29984338	Predictors and outcomes of laparoscopic nephrectomy in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.	Purpose: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common hereditary kidney disease, and 20% of patients eventually require nephrectomies due to compressive symptoms or renal-related complications. Traditionally, nephrectomies were performed via the open approach in view of space constraints. We evaluate our institution's outcomes for laparoscopic nephrectomy (LN) for ADPKD. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 33 patients with ADPKD who underwent nephrectomies from November 2005 to December 2016 at a tertiary institution. Preoperative kidney volume was calculated via the ellipsoid method by using computed tomography scan. Results: The median age was 51.0 years (interquartile range [IQR], 44.5-56.0 years). Sixteen patients (48.5%) underwent open nephrectomy (ON), 15 patients (45.5%) had LNs, and 2 patients (6.1%) had laparoscopic converted to ON due to dense adhesions. Thirteen patients had bilateral while 18 patients had unilateral nephrectomies. Median kidney volume in the open group was 1,042 cm3 (IQR, 753-2,365 cm3) versus 899 cm3 (IQR, 482-1,914 cm3) in the laparoscopy group and did not differ significantly. The operative time was comparable between both groups. Patients who underwent LN had lesser blood loss (350 mL vs. 650 mL; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.822-3.533; p=0.016) and shorter length of hospital stay (4.0 days vs. 6.5 days; 95% CI, 1.445-5.755; p=0.001) compared to patients who underwent ON. Both groups had similar low morbidity rate and no mortality. Conclusions: LN for ADPKD is a safe and effective alternative to ON independent of kidney size with comparable outcomes and benefits of minimally invasive surgery.
24969197	Emphysematous polycystic infection in a patient on peritoneal dialysis.	Emphysematous infection of the cysts in patients with polycystic kidney disease is very rare and seldom reported. We herein report a case of emphysematous polycystic infection in a 61-year-old male patient who was on peritoneal dialysis for end-stage renal disease caused by adult polycystic kidney disease. 
26588008	Long-term Kidney Transplant Outcomes in Primary Glomerulonephritis: Analysis From the ERA-EDTA Registry.	"BACKGROUND: We evaluated the 15-year kidney allograft survival in patients with primary glomerulonephritis and determined if the risk of graft loss varied with donor source within each glomerulonephritis group. METHODS: Using data from the European Renal Association-European Dialysis and Transplant Association Registry, Kaplan-Meier, competing risk, and Cox regression analyses were performed on adult, first kidney transplant recipients during 1991 to 2010 (n = 14 383). Follow-up was set to December 31, 2011. Adjustments for pretransplant dialysis duration, sex, country, and transplant era were made. ""Death-adjusted graft survival"" was assessed in patients with glomerulonephritis and compared with those with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), in which the native kidney disease cannot recur. Additionally, death-adjusted graft survival was compared between living and deceased donor transplants within each glomerulonephritis group. RESULTS: All glomerulonephritides had a 15-year death-adjusted graft survival probability above 55%. The 15-year risk of death-adjusted graft failure compared to ADPKD ranged from 1.17 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.05-1.31) for immunoglobulin A nephropathy to 2.09 (95% CI, 1.56-2.78) for membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis type II. The expected survival benefits of living over deceased donor transplants were not present in membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis type I (adjusted hazard ratios [HRa], 1.08; 95% CI, 0.73-1.60) or type II (HRa, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.32-2.52) but present in immunoglobulin A nephropathy (HRa, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.59-0.92), membranous nephropathy (HRa, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.29-0.75), and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (HRa, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.45-1.06). CONCLUSIONS: This large European study shows favorable long-term kidney graft survival in all primary glomerulonephritides, although this remains lower than graft survival in ADPKD, and confirms that the reluctance to use living donors in some primary glomerulonephritides remains unfounded. These data will further inform prospective renal transplant recipients and donors during pretransplant counselling."
37770243	Preoperative renal embolisation in patients with polycystic kidney disease requiring incisional hernia repair after renal transplantation.	In the same way that renal transcatheter arterial embolisation (TAE) has demonstrated its effectiveness and safety compared with nephrectomy of the polycystic kidney at the time of transplantation, we propose that TAE can be a minimally invasive option in the surgical preparation for incisional hernia repair in order to reduce the compressive effect of the polycystic kidney, creating space and ensuring safe hernia repair. The objective of this article is to describe the first case in which TAE is used in advance of incisional hernia secondary to renal transplantation in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.
37401705	[Features of nephrotransplant blood flow during kidney transplant].	INTRODUCTION: Kidney transplantation, which provides a high quality of life for patients with terminal chronic renal failure worldwide, is recognized as one of the main achievements of modern medicine. Graft dysfunction is an urgent problem, the one-year survival rate of renal transplants is from 93% (from cadaveric donors) to 97% (from living donors), the five-year survival rate is on average 95%. The aim of the study consisted in determining the features of renal graft blood flow in the early post-transplantation period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The results of operative treatment of 110 patients who underwent orthotopic kidney transplantation for various reasons were analyzed. The indication for transplantation was chronic kidney disease of 5 st in the outcome of the main disease: in 70 (64%) in chronic glomerulonephritis, in 22 (20%) patients in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, 10 (9%) patients in diabetic nephropathy, in 8 (7%) patients in chronic pyelonephritis. The five-year survival rate of the renal graft during catamnestic follow-up was 88%. All patients underwent ultrasound dopplerography of a renal graft in dynamics from the first day to discharge. RESULTS: After transplantation of a renal graft, blood flow disorders are caused by swelling in the early postoperative period, but further to discharge there was a normalization of the blood flow rates of the renal graft. Which suggests a satisfactory functional state of the renal graft and is a favorable prognostic feature. Reduced blood flow in the graft and increased resistance index (RI) in ultrasound with dopplerography are signs of developing graft dysfunction. CONCLUSION: In almost all cases, postoperative postoperative renal transplant transplants continued to cause blood flow disturbances due to early postoperative edema. The use of ultrasound and Doppler imaging to assess graft status is a diagnostically valuable non-invasive method.
27226665	Clinical outcomes of kidney transplants on patients with end-stage renal disease secondary to lupus nephritis, polycystic kidney disease and diabetic nephropathy.	BACKGROUND: Patients with lupus nephritis could progress to end-stage renal disease (10-22%); hence, kidney transplants should be considered as the treatment of choice for these patients. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical outcomes after kidney transplants in patients with chronic kidney diseases secondary to lupus nephritis, polycystic kidney disease and diabetes nephropathy at Pablo Tobon Uribe Hospital. METHODS: A descriptive and retrospective study performed at one kidney transplant center between 2005 and 2013. RESULTS: A total of 136 patients, 27 with lupus nephritis (19.9%), 31 with polycystic kidney disease (22.8%) and 78 with diabetes nephropathy (57.4%), were included in the study. The graft survivals after one, three and five years were 96.3%, 82.5% and 82.5% for lupus nephritis; 90%, 86% and 76.5% for polycystic kidney disease and 91.7%, 80.3% and 67.9% for diabetes nephropathy, respectively, with no significant differences (p= 0.488); the rate of lupus nephritis recurrence was 0.94%/person-year. The etiology of lupus vs diabetes vs polycystic disease was not a risk factor for a decreased time of graft survival (Hazard ratio: 1.43; 95% CI: 0.52-3.93). CONCLUSION: Kidney transplant patients with end stage renal disease secondary to lupus nephritis has similar graft and patient survival success rates to patients with other kidney diseases. The complication rate and risk of recurrence for lupus nephritis are low. Kidney transplants should be considered as the treatment of choice for patients with end stage renal disease secondary to lupus nephritis.
32690572	Uneventful case of COVID-19 in a kidney transplant recipient.	Kidney transplant recipients have been reported at a particularly high risk of severe COVID-19 illness due to chronic immunosuppression and coexisting conditions. Yet, here we describe a remarkably mild case of COVID-19 in a 62-year-old female who had a kidney transplantation 10 years earlier due to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. The patient was admitted for 1 day; immunosuppressive therapy with tacrolimus and low-dose prednisolone was continued; and the patient recovered successfully without the use of antiviral agents or oxygen therapy. The case demonstrates that kidney transplant recipients are not necessarily severely affected by COVID-19. Withdrawal of immunosuppressive therapy could be associated with poorer outcomes and should not be implemented thoughtlessly.
28159317	Novel treatment protocol for ameliorating refractory, chronic pain in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.	Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) patients can suffer from chronic pain that can be refractory to conventional treatment, resulting in a wish for nephrectomy. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of a multidisciplinary treatment protocol with sequential nerve blocks on pain relief in ADPKD patients with refractory chronic pain. As a first step a diagnostic, temporary celiac plexus block with local anesthetics was performed. If substantial pain relief was obtained, the assumption was that pain was relayed via the celiac plexus and major splanchnic nerves. When pain recurred, patients were then scheduled for a major splanchnic nerve block with radiofrequency ablation. In cases with no pain relief, it was assumed that pain was relayed via the aortico-renal plexus, and catheter-based renal denervation was performed. Sixty patients were referred, of which 44 were eligible. In 36 patients the diagnostic celiac plexus block resulted in substantial pain relief with a change in the median visual analogue scale (VAS) score pre-post intervention of 50/100. Of these patients, 23 received a major splanchnic nerve block because pain recurred, with a change in median VAS pre-post block of 53/100. In 8 patients without pain relief after the diagnostic block, renal denervation was performed in 5, with a borderline significant change in the median VAS pre-post intervention of 20/100. After a median follow-up of 12 months, 81.8% of the patients experienced a sustained improvement in pain intensity, indicating that our treatment protocol is effective in obtaining pain relief in ADPKD patients with refractory chronic pain.
27653449	Do metabolic derangements in end-stage polycystic kidney disease differ versus other primary kidney diseases?	AIM: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), a systemic disorder caused by mutation in genes encoding polycystins, has been reported to lead to metabolic derangements including new-onset diabetes mellitus after kidney transplantation. We analyzed markers of insulin resistance (IR), inflammation, nutritional status and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients with ADPKD and ESRD patients with other primary kidney diseases. METHODS: In a post hoc cross-sectional analysis in 254 non-diabetic CKD 5 patients starting on dialysis, glucose metabolism (insulin, IGF-1, homeostasis model assessment of IR, HOMA-IR), inflammation (high sensitivity C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and tumour necrosis factor), nutritional status, and bone mineral density (BMD), were assessed. Survival was recorded for median time of 28 months (IQR 15-48 months). RESULTS: Neither indices of IR, nor IGF-1, inflammatory status, nutritional status, or BMD were different in patients with ADPKD as compared to other aetiologies of ESRD. Kaplan-Meier curves showed better survival among the ADPKD group versus other aetiologies, even after an exclusion of diabetic patients. CONCLUSIONS: The ESRD phenotype did not differ in ADPKD versus other primary kidney diseases in terms of markers of IR, inflammation, and nutritional status. This argues against the proposition that ADPKD patients are more prone to develop metabolic derangements beyond those generally observed in advanced CKD. However, additional studies are warranted to further elucidate systemic metabolic aspects of ADPKD.
26095663	Common hepatic artery as inflow in kidney transplantation.	Kidney transplantation originating from the hepatic artery has not previously been reported. Herein, we report a third kidney transplantation with the common hepatic artery as inflow. A 62-year-old male with chronic renal failure due to polycystic kidney disease was proposed to a third kidney transplantation. CT-scan showed diffuse calcification of the aorto-iliac axis and the splenic artery. The common hepatic artery was the only artery suitable for anastomosis and as such was chosen as the inflow for retransplantation. The operation was performed through a right subcostal laparotomy. A saphenous bypass was interposed between the common hepatic artery and the graft, then the renal vein was anastomosed to the suprarenal inferior vena cava. Duration of warm ischemia was 27 min. Postoperative course was complicated with delayed graft function of 17 days and pulmonary infection. Patient was discharged at day 30. With a follow-up of 40 months, serum creatinine level and eGFR are, respectively, 191 micromol/L and 32 mL/min. Hepato-renal bypass technique can be used in kidney retransplantation when patient anatomy is not compatible with other classical options. 
24935705	Renal transplantation in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.	In patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) evaluated for kidney transplantation, issues related to native nephrectomy, cystic liver involvement, screening for intracranial aneurysms and living-related kidney donation deserve special consideration. Prophylactic native nephrectomy is restricted to patients with a history of cyst infection or recurrent haemorrhage or to those in whom space must be made to implant the graft. Patients with liver involvement require pretransplant imaging. Selection of patients for pretransplant screening of intracranial aneurysms should follow the general recommendations for patients with ADPKD. In living related-donor candidates aged <30 years and at-risk of ADPKD, molecular genetic testing should be carried out when ultrasonography and MRI findings are normal or equivocal. After kidney transplantation, patient and graft survival rates are excellent and the volume of native kidneys decreases. However, liver cysts continue to grow and treatment with a somatostatin analogue should be considered in patients with massive cyst involvement. Cerebrovascular events have a marginal effect on post-transplant morbidity and mortality. An increased risk of new-onset diabetes mellitus and nonmelanoma skin cancers has been reported, but several studies have challenged these findings. Finally, no data currently support the preferential use of mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors as immunosuppressive agents in transplant recipients with ADPKD. 
32440858	Candida albicans and Staphylococcus lugdunensis superinfection of liver cysts in a patient with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease under prednisolone treatment.	We report a case of superinfection of liver cysts caused by Candida albicans and Staphylococcus lugdunensis in a patient with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. A 69-year-old man with chief complaints of headache and blurred vision was admitted to the former institution for the evaluation of suspected temporal arteritis. He was prescribed oral prednisolone (55 mg/day) as a preemptive treatment; however, he became febrile and presented with bilateral flank pain during prednisolone tapering. Blood culture revealed fungemia as a result of Candida famata infection; thus, micafungin treatment was started. Thereafter, recrudescence of the C-reactive protein level ensued. Then a cyst infection as visualized on magnetic resonance imaging led to cyst aspiration sclerotherapy. Cyst aspirate culture revealed the presence of C. albicans in one of the cysts and S. lugdunensis in two of the cysts. The patient was clinically stabilized with an additional 3 weeks of antibiotic and antifungal drug administration.
28983800	A potentially crucial role of the PKD1 C-terminal tail in renal prognosis.	BACKGROUND: Autosomal dominant polycystic disease (ADPKD) often results in renal failure. Recently, allelic influences of PKD1 mutation types on renal survival were extensively investigated. Here, we analyzed integrated influences of PKD1 mutation types and positions on renal survival. METHODS: We included 338 (82 pedigrees) and 72 (12 pedigrees) patients with PKD1 and PKD2 mutations, respectively, identified through comprehensive gene analysis of 101 probands with ADPKD. Genetic testing was performed using next-generation sequencing, long-range PCR, and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. Pathogenic mutations were identified by a software package-integrated seven databases and provided access to five cloud-based computing systems. RESULTS: Mean renal survivals of carriers with PKD1 non-truncating-type mutations at positions upstream of G-protein-coupled receptor proteolytic site (GPS-upstream domain), transmembrane domain, or cytoplasmic C-terminal tail (CTT) domain were 70.2, 67.0, and 50.1 years, respectively (P < 0.0001); renal survival was shorter for mutation positions closer to CTT domain, suggesting its crucial role in renal prognosis. Furthermore, in truncating-type mutations, strong inactivation is anticipated on nucleotides downstream from the mutation site, implying CTT domain inactivation irrespective of mutation site. Shorter mean renal survival was found for PKD1 truncating-type than non-truncating-type mutation carriers (P = 0.0348); mean renal survival was not different between PKD1 3'- and 5'-region truncating-type mutation carriers (P = 0.4375), but was shorter in PKD1 3'-region than in 5'-region non-truncating-type mutation carriers (P = 0.0014). Variable strength of CTT domain inactivation might account for these results. CONCLUSIONS: Aforementioned findings indicate that CTT domain's crucial role in renal prognosis needs further investigation by larger studies (ClinicalTrials.gov; NCT02322385).
27452494	[A Case of Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) with Metastases from Bilateral Small Renal Cell Carcinoma].	The patient was a 47 year-old female who had autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) with bilateral small renal cell carcinoma (RCC). We performed bilateral partial nephrectomy and radiofrequency ablation to the residual tumor. Pathological diagnosis was clear cell carcinoma,Fuhrman grade 3. Sunitinib therapy was started nine months after the operation because multiple liver metastases occurred. Twenty-six months after the operation,she died from rapid progression of liver metastasis. 
25438190	Novel therapeutic approaches to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.	Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is an inherited disorder characterized by the progressive growth of renal cysts that, over time, destroy the architecture of the renal parenchyma and typically lead to kidney failure by the sixth decade of life. ADPKD is common and represents a leading cause of renal failure worldwide. Currently, there are no Food and Drug Administration-approved treatments for the disease, and the existing standard of care is primarily supportive in nature. However, significant advances in the understanding of the molecular biology of the disease have inspired investigation into potential new therapies. Several drugs designed to slow or arrest the progression of ADPKD have shown promise in preclinical models and clinical trials, including vasopressin receptor antagonists and somatostatin analogs. This article examines the literature underlying the rationale for molecular therapies for ADPKD and reviews the existing clinical evidence for their indication for human patients with the disease. 
27730438	Clinical Trials and a View Toward the Future of ADPKD.	In light of the advances in the understanding of cystogenesis in clinical syndromes, potential therapeutic targets have been proposed. Among ciliopathies, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common hereditary disease, and is characterized by the progressive enlargement of bilateral renal cysts, resulting in end-stage kidney failure. Progress in genetics and molecular pathobiology has enabled the development of therapeutic agents that can modulate aberrant molecular pathways. Recently, clinical trials using somatostatin analogs and vasopressin receptor antagonists were conducted, and resulted in the approval of tolvaptan in managing kidney disease in some countries. We will summarize the developments of therapeutic agents based on pathogenesis, and discuss recent findings in clinical trials. Moreover, issues such as the timing of the intervention and outcome assessment will be discussed.
30019678	Clinical predictors of escalating care in hepatic and renal cyst infection in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney and liver disease.	BACKGROUND: Cyst infection may occur in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) and autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease (ADPLD). Antimicrobial agents often fail to control infection, leading to invasive action. We aimed to identify factors predicting escalation of care. METHODS: ADPKD and ADPLD patients were identified from local/national databases (2001-2013). Records were screened for patients meeting criteria for cyst infection (positive cyst aspirate and/or clinical findings). Factors that predict escalated care were identified with multivariate modified Poisson regression. RESULTS: We screened 1773 patients. A total of 77 patients with cyst infection (4.3%) were included for analysis (hepatic 36%; male 49%; age 54 +-; 13 years; ADPKD 95%; dialysis 9%, diabetes 18%, renal transplant 56%, eGFR [IQR 24-78] ml/min/1.73 m2 (excluding patients with a history of renal transplant or receiving dialysis)). A pathogen was identified in 71% of cases. Escherichia coli was the most common pathogen and accounted for 69% of cases. Initial treatment was limited to antibiotics in 87% of patients (n = 67), 40% included a fluoroquinolone. Ultimately, 48% of patients underwent some form of invasive action (escalation of care). Increasing white blood cell count (WBC) (RR 1.04 95%-CI 1.01-1.07, p = 0.008) was associated with escalating care, whereas an increase in time between transplant and infection (RR 0.92 95% CI 0.86-0.97, p = 0.005) and E. coli isolation (RR 0.55 95% CI 0.34-0.89, p = 0.02) were protective. CONCLUSION: High serum WBC, isolation of atypical pathogens and early infection after transplantation are factors that increase the risk of escalation of care in hepatic and renal cyst infection patients.
37935200	Feasibility and impact of ketogenic dietary interventions in polycystic kidney disease: KETO-ADPKD-a randomized controlled trial.	Ketogenic dietary interventions (KDIs) are beneficial in animal models of autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). KETO-ADPKD, an exploratory, randomized, controlled trial, is intended to provide clinical translation of these findings (NCT04680780). Sixty-six patients were randomized to a KDI arm (ketogenic diet [KD] or water fasting [WF]) or the control group. Both interventions induce significant ketogenesis on the basis of blood and breath acetone measurements. Ninety-five percent (KD) and 85% (WF) report the diet as feasible. KD leads to significant reductions in body fat and liver volume. Additionally, KD is associated with reduced kidney volume (not reaching statistical significance). Interestingly, the KD group exhibits improved kidney function at the end of treatment, while the control and WF groups show a progressive decline, as is typical in ADPKD. Safety-relevant events are largely mild, expected (initial flu-like symptoms associated with KD), and transient. Safety assessment is complemented by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) lipid profile analyses.
32895143	[Application of immunosuppressants in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease after kidney transplantation].	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the optimal dose range of immunosuppressants in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) after renal transplantation. METHODS: A cohort of 68 patients with ADPKD who received their first renal transplantation between March, 2000 and January, 2018 in our institute were retrospectively analyzed, with 68 non-ADPKD renal transplant recipients matched for gender, age and date of transplant as the control group. We analyzed the differences in patient and renal survival rates, postoperative complications and concentrations of immunosuppressive agents between the two groups at different time points within 1 year after kidney transplantation. The concentrations of the immunosuppressants were also compared between the ADPKD patients with urinary tract infections (UTI) and those without UTI after the transplantation. RESULTS: The recipients with ADPKD and the control recipients showed no significantly difference in the overall 1-, 5-, and 10- year patient survival rates (96.6% vs 96.0%, 94.1% vs 93.9%, and 90.6% vs 93.9%, respectively; P > 0.05), 1-, 5-, and 10-year graft survival rates (95.2% vs 96.0%, 90.8% vs 87.2%, and 79.0% vs 82.3%, respectively; P > 0.05), or the incidences of other post- transplant complications including acute rejection, gastrointestinal symptoms, cardiovascular events, pneumonia, and neoplasms (P > 0.05). The plasma concentrations of both tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil (MPA) in ADPKD group were significantly lower than those in the control group at 9 months after operation (P < 0.05). The incidence of UTI was significantly higher in ADPKD patients than in the control group (P < 0.05). In patients with ADPKD, those with UTI after transplantation had a significantly higher MPA plasma concentration (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with ADPKD after renal transplant, a higher dose of MPA is associated with a increased risk of UTI, and their plasma concentrations of immunosuppressants for long-term maintenance of immunosuppression regimen can be lower than those in other kidney transplantation recipients.
25635587	Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease in children.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common hereditary renal disease, affecting one in 500 individuals. The cardinal manifestation of ADPKD is progressive cystic dilatation of renal tubules with kidney enlargement and progression to end-stage renal disease in approximately half of cases by 60 years of age. Although previously considered a condition of adults, it is clear that children and young adults are subject to the complications of ADPKD. RECENT FINDINGS: It has been increasingly recognized that interventions early in life are necessary in order to confer the best long-term outcome in this common condition. Therefore, it is imperative for pediatricians to recognize the manifestations and complications of this disease. Until recently ADPKD management focused on general principles of chronic kidney disease. However, several recent clinical trials in children and adults with ADPKD have focused on disease-specific therapies. SUMMARY: This review will highlight the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and appropriate management of ADPKD in childhood and will review recent relevant clinical trials in children and adults with this condition.
30954962	Prostatic cyst in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease: unusual association.	Prostate cyst, as an extrarenal manifestation in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, although infrequent, nevertheless goes beyond tenuous concomitance and may rarely contribute to recurrent urinary tract infection or outflow obstruction and mostly remains asymptomatic. In this context, we report a case of incidentally detected, an asymptomatic prostatic cyst in a patient of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.
26924061	Long-term graft outcomes and patient survival are lower posttransplant in patients with a primary renal diagnosis of glomerulonephritis.	Glomerulonephritis (GN) is the primary diagnosis in 20% to 40% of patients receiving a renal transplant. Here we studied patient survival and graft outcomes in patients with GN transplanted in the UK. UK Renal Registry data were used to analyze patient survival and graft failure in incident transplant patients between 1997 to 2009 who had a diagnosis of primary GN, in comparison to patients transplanted with adult polycystic kidney disease (APKD) or diabetes. Multivariable regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, donor type, ethnicity, donor age, time on dialysis, human leukocyte antigen mismatch, cold ischemic time, and graft failure (for patient survival). Patients were followed up through December 2012. Of 4750 patients analyzed, 2975 had GN and 1775 APKD. Graft failure was significantly higher in membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) type II (hazard ratio: 3.5, confidence interval: 1.9-6.6), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (2.4, 1.8-3.2), MPGN type I (2.3, 1.6-3.3), membranous nephropathy (2.0, 1.4-2.9), and IgA nephropathy (1.6, 1.3-2.0) compared to APKD. Survival was significantly reduced in patients with MPGN type II (4.7, 2.0-10.8), and those with lupus nephritis (1.8, 1.1-2.9). Overall graft failure for patients with GN was similar to those with diabetes. Thus, in comparison to outcomes in APKD, graft survival is significantly lower in most GNs, with variation in outcomes between different GNs. This information should assist in pretransplant counseling of patients. Further study is required to understand the reduced survival seen in lupus nephritis and MPGN type II, and to improve overall graft outcomes. 
30792061	C-reactive protein as a prognostic risk factor for loss of arteriovenous fistula patency in hemodialyzed patients.	BACKGROUND: Inflammation is a cardiovascular risk factor in hemodialysis patients, but its influence on vascular access patency is still debatable. Our prospective study investigated this issue. METHODS: A total of 258 patients receiving an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) between 2006 and 2016 at the Municipal Hospital Arad were included. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics were collected at the time of creation of the AVF. The primary study end point was AVF patency loss, defined as an event occurring at least 2 months after AVF formation and requiring surgical revision or replacement of the fistula. The patients were followed up for a median time of 26 months. RESULTS: In our group, the mean age was 59.7 +- 13.2 years (median, 62 years), and 60.1% were male. During follow-up, 134 patients (51.9%) maintained AVF patency, whereas 124 (48.1%) lost AVF patency within a mean time of 23.3 +- 28.1 months (median, 10.5 months). We found that age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.015; P = .035) and C-reactive protein (CRP) level (HR, 1.17; P < .0001) were associated with a higher risk of loss of AVF patency. The protective factors for AVF patency were autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (HR, 0.336; P = .009), pre-emptive AVF (HR, 0.648; P = .031), and higher level of triglycerides (HR, 0.998; P = .035). In the multivariate adjusted Cox model, CRP level remained an independent predictor for loss of AVF patency (HR, 1.17; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-1.3; P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: In our study, CRP level was an independent predictor of AVF patency loss, whereas better AVF survival was independently associated with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and pre-emptive AVF. As a simple noninvasive marker of chronic inflammation, CRP level may be a useful tool to predict AVF outcomes. Further research is needed to assess the protective effects of inflammation reduction on AVF survival.
30517147	Infected cyst in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease: Analysis of computed tomographic and ultrasonographic imaging features.	PURPOSE: To investigate the imaging features of cyst infection in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) patients using computed tomography (CT) and ultrasonography (US). MATERIALS & METHODS: The institutional review board approved this retrospective study. Fifty-one episodes with proven cyst infection in forty-three ADPKD patients were included. Two experienced abdominal radiologists reviewed CT and US images and evaluated the following imaging features in consensus: cyst size, location, cyst shape, intracystic attenuation, intracystic echogenicity, intracystic heterogeneity, wall thickness, the presence of fluid-fluid level, septation, intracystic gas, pericystic fat infiltration, and pericystic hyperemia. Intracystic attenuation was measured for all infected cysts and two presumed normal cysts and compared using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. RESULTS: On CT scans, the median size of infected cysts was 5.5 cm (range: 2.3-18.8 cm) and 46 of 51 (90.2%) infected cysts were located in the subcapsular region. Most (48 of 51, 94.1%) infected cysts showed lobulated, focal bulging or irregular shape. Discernible wall thickening (84.1%) was the most frequently found imaging feature of infected cysts followed by relatively higher intracystic attenuation compared to normal cysts (79.1%) and pericystic fat infiltration (52.9%). Fluid/fluid level was found in 3 of 51 (5.9%) infected cysts and intracystic gas was found in 3 of 51 (5.9%) infected cysts, respectively. For hepatic cysts, 11 of 14 (78.6%) infected cysts showed pericystic hyperemia. Intracystic attenuation was significantly higher in infected cysts (median; 19.0 HU) than in presumed normal cysts (median; 8.5 HU) (P<0.001), and exceeded 25 HU in 18 (35.3%) of 51 infected cysts. Among the 41 infected cysts for which US images were available, 35 (85.1%) showed heterogeneous echogenicity. CONCLUSION: Minute imaging features such as minimal wall thickening or relatively high attenuation compared to normal cysts would be helpful to detect infected cysts in ADPKD patients.
30056917	Native Nephrectomy in Renal Transplant Recipients With Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease.	INTRODUCTION: Patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) represent about 10% of kidney transplant recipients (KTR) and have unique needs regarding acceptance for this procedure. Whether native kidney nephrectomy (NKN) affects kidney transplantation (KT) outcomes remains a matter of debate, and more data is needed to establish a standard approach to KTR with ADPKD. AIM: To analyze the prevalence, timing, and short- and long-term outcomes of NKN in a cohort of ADPKD recipients in a single institution. METHOD: Retrospective, observational study. RESULTS: In the years 1993 to 2016 we identified 162 KTR with ADPKD; of those, 149 had known NKN status. A high proportion of ADPKD KTR (n = 72) underwent NKN, the majority of which (69.4%) were performed before KT. There was no difference in short-term and long-term transplantation outcomes (including death, graft loss, delayed graft function, acute rejection, bacterial and cytomegalovirus [CMV] infection, and post-transplant diabetes mellitus) between NKN and non-NKN groups in a median of 98 months of follow-up. However, we found a significant difference in time on a waiting list, which was longer in the NKN group vs non-NKN. CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for a consensus regarding indications and timing for NKN in recipients with ADPKD. The systematic acquisition, sharing, and analysis of accessible data on NKN between institutions is an important step toward meeting this need. In our cohort, we found no impact of the NKN procedure on KT impact. However, undergoing NKN significantly prolonged the time on the waiting list.
31296478	Anterior Cerebral Artery Dissection in a Patient With Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease.	Intracranial artery dissection secondary to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is far less common than cerebral aneurysm. A 55-year-old man presented a sudden onset of headache and disturbed consciousness caused by ischemic stroke in the bilateral frontal lobes with minor subarachnoid hemorrhage. The bilateral anterior cerebral arteries were firstly occluded and re-perfused with irregular narrowing and dilation in 3 days after stroke onset, indicating dissection. He was diagnosed with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease by abdominal CT findings and by his family history though his renal function was almost normal. Dissection in the anterior cerebral artery has not been reported previously, while some cases with dissection in the vertebral and extracranial arteries were reported in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. His family also had a history of aortic dissection and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Intracranial artery dissection may be a manifestation of systemic arteriopathy with familial clustering in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Strict antihypertensive treatment is needed in these cases.
25689455	Clinical manifestations of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To describe the recent increase in the understanding of the clinical manifestation of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD), which is caused by mutations in the PKHD1 gene. The change in nomenclature reflects the genetic contribution to the understanding of pleiotropic disease manifestations. The term 'hepatorenal fibrocystic disorder' or 'ARPKD-congenital hepatic fibrosis (CHF)' addresses the major organ manifestations of the disease. RECENT FINDINGS: More than 300 different mutations in the PKHD1 gene have been described; however, there is no genotype-phenotype correlation. Cystic phenotype in the kidneys is highly variable. Renal oligohydramnios before 28 weeks of gestation may be lethal, whereas perinatal manifestations have a better prognosis. More than 60% of neonates with pulmonary hypoplasia may survive; about 25% need postnatal dialysis. After 10 years, 60% require renal replacement therapy. Liver fibrosis is always found and cholangiodysplasia is common. The Caroli phenotype is seen in up to 80% with perinatal manifestation. Recurrent cholangitis and cirrhosis may require liver transplantation in about 10% of patients. Neurocognitive development is in the usual range of children with moderate renal failure, but deserves further research. SUMMARY: The pleiotropic manifestations of ARPKD-CHF require multidisciplinary efforts to anticipate organ complications and to improve a possible good prognosis.
27143265	Peritoneal dialysis for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease: a retrospective study.	To describe the long-term clinical outcomes of patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) who are on peritoneal dialysis (PD) therapy. We performed a retrospective matched-cohort analysis comparing the clinical outcomes of 30 ADPKD patients with those of 30 non-diabetic patients who had bilateral small kidneys between July 1 2007 and July 31 2014. The patient groups were matched by age, gender, and time of PD initiation. There were no significant differences in the demographic or biochemical parameters, comorbid conditions, residual glomerular filtration rate, or Charlson comorbidity score at the beginning of PD. The median renal volume was 1315 ml for the ADPKD group and 213 ml for the control group. Patients with ADPKD had similar 3-year patient survival (90.6% versus 86.3%, P=0.807) and technique survival (89.2% versus 74.3%, P=0.506) compared with non-ADPKD patients. Also, there was no significant difference in the peritonitis-free survival between the ADPKD and control groups (P=0.22), and rates of peritonitis were similar (0.19 versus 0.21 episodes per patient-year, P=0.26). No differences were observed in the incidence of PD-related complications, such as hernia and dialysate leak. ADPKD is not a contraindication for PD, and a subgroup of ADPKD patients with relatively small kidney volume can be treated using PD. 
33125856	Prevalence, risk factors and disease knowledge of polycystic kidney disease in Pakistan.	Polycystic kidneys disease refers to cyst(s) formation in kidneys with severe consequences of end stage renal disease thus have higher mortality. It is a common genetic disease occurring either as autosomal dominant polycystic kidney (ADPKD) or autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) with prevalence rates of 1/1000 and 1/40,000 respectively. Dominant forms presenting in later (>30) while recessive in earlier ages (infancy) and affecting both sexes and almost all race. The patient experiences many renal as well as extra-renal manifestations with marked hypertension and cyst formation in other organs predominantly in liver. Due to genetic basis, positive family history is considered as major risk factor. Ultrasonography remains the main stay of diagnosis along with family history, by indicating increased renal size and architectural modifications. Initially disease remains asymptomatic, later on symptomatic treatment is suggested with surgical interventions like cyst decortications or drainage. Dialysis proved to be beneficial in end stage renal disease. However renal transplantation is the treatment of choice.
30368514	Co-Inheritance of Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease and Naevoid Basal Cell Carcinoma Syndrome: Effects on Renal Progression.	The calcium signalling and hedgehog (HH) signalling pathways operate in the primary cilium. Abnormalities in these pathways cause autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) and naevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS) respectively. Several reports have proposed that hyperactivation of the HH pathway in animal models of polycystic kidney disease affects normal renal development and renal cyst phenotype. A family with 2 cases (a proband and her sister) of ADPKD and NBCCS coinheritance led us to investigate whether interactions may be present in the 2 pathways. The effect of HH pathway hyperactivation (due to c.573C>G mutation on PTCH1 gene that cause NBCCS) on renal ADPKD progression in the proband was compared to 18 age- and sex-matched ADPKD patients in a 9-year, prospective, follow-up study. Blood pressure, total kidney volume, estimated glomerular filtration rate, plasma copeptin, urine excretion of albumin, total protein and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) were analysed. Data for the sibling was not available. In the ADPKD group, blood pressure and estimated glomerular filtration rate were within normal values, and total kidney volume and MCP-1 increased (p < 0.01) throughout the study. In comparison, during the 9-year follow-up, the proband showed persistent hypertension (from 125/85 to 140/95 mm Hg), low total kidney volume (75 and 61% of median ADPKD), and a ninefold increase in urine MCP-1. We found no differences in urine excretion of albumin or plasma copeptin values. These results suggest that HH hyperactivation may play a minimal role in ADPKD progression. These observations can help to clarify the clinical impact of affected pathways in renal development and cystogenesis in humans.
38010252	[The Educational Aspect in Promoting a Low-Sodium Diet, Physical Activity and Therapy Adherence among Patients with Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Disease: A Literature Review].	Background. Polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common monogenic cause of End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), and, thus, of kidney transplantation and dialysis. Educational interventions aimed to improve adherence to therapy, physical performance, and adequate food intake in patients can slow down disease progression by developing self-care skills, which are useful to promote their autonomy while aligning their life plans and required treatments. The aim of this review is to analyze the adherence of patients with polycystic kidney to pharmacological therapy, low-sodium diet, and physical activity, as evidenced in the clinical literature to guide structured educational interventions. Methods. We conducted a literature review from 01/09/2021 to 30/12/2022 through the combination of free keywords and MeSH terms on the databases: PubMed, CINAHL and Cochrane. Results. Findings in medical literature show that physical activity can improve blood pressure control and a low-sodium diet can slow down the progression towards ESRD. Furthermore, although patients may adhere to the complex drug therapy, unresolved educational demands concern choices and behaviors of daily life that, involving the sphere of feelings and emotions, can evolve into manifestations of anxiety and stress. Conclusion. Among ADPKD patients a personalized educational support, considering disease stage and psychological factors, may enable them to acquire knowledge, skills, and behaviors that can improve clinical outcomes.
28937072	Epidemiology of end-stage renal disease in Dubai: Single-center data.	Hemodialysis (HD) was first established in Dubai in the year 1980 and was in its full capacity by the year 1983. Since then, the HD population has been growing rapidly. This report represents the demographic data and clinical characteristics of our HD patients during the period between January 2012 and October 2016. Diabetic nephropathy (57%) and hypertension (12.4%) are emerging as the most common causes of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in our data, followed by undetermined causes in those who presented as ESRD (10.9%), and then by rejected transplant in 4.6%. Obstructive uropathy in our data was 4.37% among all causes. The causes were primary glomerulonephritis (only proven cases in kidney biopsy were counted) in 3.6%, adult polycystic kidney disease in 2.43%, and lupus nephritis in 1.45% of cases. The prevalence of ESRD in the current study was 152 patients per million population per year.
37208103	Issues in multi-organ transplantation of the liver with kidney or heart in polycystic liver-kidney disease or congenital heart disease: Current practices and immunological aspects.	Solid organ transplantation has become an integral part of the management of patients with end-stage diseases of the kidney, liver, heart and lungs. Most procedures occur in isolation, but multi-organ transplantation of the liver with either the kidney or heart has become an option. As more patients with congenital heart disease and cardiac cirrhosis survive into adulthood, particularly after the Fontan procedure, liver transplant teams are expected to face questions regarding multi-organ (heart-liver) transplantation. Similarly, patients with polycystic kidneys and livers may be managed by multi-organ transplantation. Herein, we review the indications and outcomes of simultaneous liver-kidney transplantation for polycystic liver-kidney disease, and discuss the indications, timing and procedural aspects of combined heart-liver transplantation. We also summarise the evidence for, and potential mechanisms underlying, the immunoprotective impact of liver allografts on the simultaneously transplanted organs.
28905441	The vasopressin system: new insights for patients with kidney diseases: Epidemiological evidence and therapeutic perspectives.	People with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at risk of severe outcomes, such as end-stage renal disease or cardiovascular disease, and CKD is a globally increasing health burden with a high personal and economic cost. Despite major progresses in prevention and therapeutics in last decades, research is still needed to reverse this epidemic trend. The regulation of water balance and the state of activation of the vasopressin system have emerged as factors tightly associated with kidney health, in the general population but also in specific conditions; among them, various stages of CKD, diabetes and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Basic science findings and also epidemiological evidence have justified important efforts towards interventional studies supporting causality, and opening therapeutic avenues. On the basis of recent clinical data, the blockade of V2 vasopressin receptors using tolvaptan in patients with rapidly progressing ADPKD has been granted in several countries, and a long-term randomized trial evaluating the effect of an increase in water intake in patients with CKD is on-going.
38192077	Comparison between Retroperitoneal Laparoscopic Nephrectomy and Traditional Open Nephrectomy to Treat Polycystic Kidney Disease before Kidney Transplantation.	PURPOSE: To compare the efficiency and safety between retroperitoneal laparoscopic nephrectomy and traditional open nephrectomy to treat autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease before kidney transplantation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 57 patients diagnosed with huge autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease between 2000 and 2020 at our center were included in this study.Patients were divided into a retroperitoneal laparoscopic (RL; n=23) group and traditional open (TO; n=34) group. We retrospectively analyzed and compared preoperative and perioperative variables between the two groups. RESULTS: Patients in the RL group showed a longer operation time (201.09+-83.76min) compared to patients in the TO group (113.38+-51.84min, p<0.001). The RL group also showed significantly less intraoperative blood loss (p=0.025) and less intraoperative blood transfusion volume (p=0.016) compared to the TO group. Meanwhile, time of gastrointestinal function recovery, bed leave, catheter indwelling and postoperative hospitalization in the RL group were 2.13+-0.63, 1.30+-1.0, 5.22+-2.09, 7.35+-2.48 days, respectively, which were significantly shorter than the TO group (p<0.05). Pain degree of patients during the first 48 hours after operation was similar between the RL and TO groups, but Opioid use percentage in the RL group was 8.70% (2/23) and was lower than the 26.47% (9/34) in the TO group (p=0.022). Meanwhile, 5 and 23 patients exhibited postoperative complications in the RL and TO groups, respectively (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Both retroperitoneal laparoscopic nephrectomy and traditional open surgery are feasible to treat huge polycystic nephrectomy. However, patients who undergo retroperitoneal laparoscopic nephrectomy experience higher levels of safety and recover more rapidly.
26680051	Graft Survival in Patients With Polycystic Kidney Disease With Nephrectomy of Native Kidney Pretransplant.	INTRODUCTION: Autosomal-dominant polycystic disease (ADPKD) represents 5%-10% of cases of end-stage renal failure. However, management of these patients in terms of whether or not to perform a transplant and optimal timing remains controversial. The objective of our analysis was to evaluate graft survival in patients with ADPKD in which we conduct pretransplant nephrectomy. METHODS: This retrospective study including renal transplant patients secondary to ADPKD in our hospital between January 2000 and December 2012. Pretransplant native kidney nephrectomy was indicated in cases of need for space or repeated complications (cysts). We compared the initial function and graft survival between groups of transplanted based on whether nephrectomy had been performed or not. RESULTS: Eighty-seven patients underwent a kidney transplant owing to ADPKD; 62% (n = 54) were male, with an average age of 55.22 years. Twenty-seven patients (30%) underwent nephrectomy native kidneys before transplantation. There were no serious postoperative complications. Patients who underwent nephrectomy (group 1) showed values of creatinine of 1.57 and 1.50 mg/dL at 3 and 6 months, respectively. In the no nephrectomy group, these values were 2.03 and 1.83 mg/dL, respectively. Graft survival after the first year was of 98% for group 1 and 95% for group 2. The 5-year implant survival was 95% and 80%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Native kidney nephrectomy before transplantation in ADPKD is safe in an experienced center, both in terms of surgery-related morbidity and mortality and graft survival and function.
37729939	Polycystic Kidney Disease Diet: What Is Known and What Is Safe.	Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a genetic disorder characterized by kidney cyst formation and progressive kidney function loss. Dietary interventions such as caloric restriction, intermittent fasting, and the ketogenic diet have recently emerged as potential strategies to induce metabolic reprogramming and slow ADPKD progression. We review the available evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of these interventions in ADPKD. Dietary interventions show promise in managing ADPKD by improving metabolic health and reducing oxidative stress. However, while preclinical studies have shown favorable outcomes, limited clinical evidence supports their effectiveness. Also, the long-term consequences of these dietary interventions, including their impact on adverse events in ADPKD patients, remain uncertain. To optimize ADPKD management, patients are advised to follow a dietary regimen that aims to achieve or maintain an ideal weight and includes high fluid intake, low sodium, and limited concentrated sweets. Caloric restriction appears particularly beneficial for individuals with overweight or obesity as it promotes weight loss and improves metabolic parameters. Supplementation with curcumin, ginkgolide B, saponins, vitamin E, niacinamide, or triptolide has demonstrated uncertain clinical benefit in ADPKD patients. Notably, beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) supplements have shown promise in animal models; however, their safety and efficacy in ADPKD require further evaluation through well-designed clinical trials. Therefore, the use of these supplements is not currently recommended for ADPKD patients. In summary, dietary interventions such as caloric restriction, intermittent fasting, and the ketogenic diet hold promise in ADPKD management by enhancing metabolic health. However, extensive clinical research is necessary to establish their effectiveness and long-term impacts. Adhering to personalized dietary guidelines, including weight management and specific nutritional restrictions, can contribute to optimal ADPKD management. Future research should prioritize well-designed clinical trials to determine the benefits and safety of dietary interventions and supplementation in ADPKD.
38367183	A case of late-onset organizing pneumonia following COVID-19 infection in a post-kidney transplant patient.	A 50-year-old man who had undergone a living-donor kidney transplant 12 years prior for chronic renal failure due to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease contracted coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). He had a positive antigen test, mild symptoms, sore throat, and fever of 37.9 C. The patient was treated with molnupiravir for 5 days, and the symptoms disappeared 5 days after onset. However, 10 days after onset, he developed a fever of approximately 37 C and a non-productive cough; 27 days after onset, the patient was hospitalized for anorexia and a worsening respiratory condition. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antigen test results on admission were negative, and no antiviral medications were administered against SARS-CoV-2. Computed tomography revealed extensive ground-glass opacities in both lung fields. The patient was treated with steroid pulse therapy, ceftriaxone, atovaquone, azithromycin, and respiratory management using a high-flow nasal cannula. The combined therapies were successful, and the patient was managed with a nasal oxygen cannula after 3 days. Oxygen administration was discontinued after 6 days of hospitalization, and the patient was discharged after 14 days. Based on the laboratory findings, bacterial, interstitial, and Pneumocystis pneumonia were unlikely. The success of the steroid pulse therapy suggested that respiratory failure was caused by pneumonia due to the immune response after COVID-19 infection.

A 51-year-old female, with non-alcoholic liver cirrhosis, portal hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease with a clipped cerebral aneurysm and chronic kidney disease stage 5 was on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) for 6.5 years elsewhere. She came for opinion on continuation of CAPD as she had 21 episodes of peritonitis in 76 months. Her blood pressure was 80/50 mmHg. She was on haemodialysis with a temporary central access for 2 weeks. She had no abdominal tenderness, and exit site looked normal. Fluid was negative for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Laparoscopically, we replaced the catheter with a new swan-neck Tenckhoff double-cuff catheter through a different exit site in the same sitting. Catheter-tip biofilm culture isolated Enterococcus casseliflavus. Peritoneal sampling biopsy showed evidence of fibrosis. She has adequate ultrafiltration and is currently on automated peritoneal dialysis for 5 months.
25385286	MicroRNAs in kidney physiology and disease.	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression. They have important roles during kidney development, homeostasis and disease. In particular, miRNAs participate in the onset and progression of tubulointerstitial sclerosis and end-stage glomerular lesions that occur in various forms of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Therefore, miRNAs represent potential new therapeutic targets for a debilitating disease that continues to increase in prevalence worldwide and for which fully effective therapies are lacking. Several lines of research aimed at improving common CKD diagnostic tools and avoiding invasive kidney biopsies have also identified circulating miRNAs as possible diagnostic and even prognostic biomarkers of kidney disease. This Review discusses current understanding of the function of miRNAs in CKD, focusing on functions specifically involved in the transforming growth factor beta1 pathway, which is activated in CKD. miRNAs that, according to available evidence, seem to be involved in diabetic nephropathy, IgA nephropathy, lupus nephritis, polycystic kidney disease and graft rejection, are also discussed. 
25915482	Therapeutic Targets in Polycystic Liver Disease.	Polycystic liver diseases (PLD) are a group of genetic disorders initiated by mutations in several PLD-related genes and characterized by the presence of multiple cholangiocyte-derived hepatic cysts that progressively replace liver tissue. PLD co-exists with Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) and Autosomal Recessive PKD as well as occurs alone (i.e., Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Liver Disease [ADPLD]). PLD associated with ADPKD and ARPKD belong to a group of disorders known as cholangiociliopathies since many disease-causative and disease-related proteins are expressed in primary cilia of cholangiocytes. Aberrant expression of these proteins in primary cilia affects their structures and functions promoting cystogenesis. Current medical therapies for PLD include symptomatic management and surgical interventions. To date, the only available drug treatment for PLD patients that halt disease progression and improve quality of life are somatostatin analogs. However, the modest clinical benefits, need for long-term maintenance therapy, and the high cost of treatment justify the necessity for more effective treatment options. Substantial evidence suggests that experimental manipulations with components of the signaling pathways that influence cyst development (e.g., cAMP, intracellular calcium, receptor tyrosine kinase, transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 4 (TRPV4) channel, mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), histone deacetylase (HDAC6), Cdc25A phosphatase, miRNAs and metalloproteinases) attenuate growth of hepatic cysts. Many of these targets have been evaluated in pre-clinical trials suggesting their value as potential new therapies. This review outlines the current clinical and preclinical treatment strategies for PLD.
25716074	Inadvertent transmission of polycystic kidney disease in kidney transplantation.	BACKGROUND: Although organ donors are rigorously tested, occasionally an unidentified donor disease can be transmitted to the recipient. These conditions include malignancies, infections, and, rarely, congenital diseases. CASE REPORT: We report a case of an inadvertent transmission of polycystic kidney disease from a 40-year-old trauma victim to both kidney recipients. There was no family history of renal disease in the donor. The renal allografts gradually increased in size with the development of cysts and functioned for 10 and 14 years. CONCLUSIONS: We report a case of inadvertent transmission of polycystic kidney disease from an unsuspecting deceased donor to both the recipients through renal allograft. Both the grafts lasted long enough to suggest that polycystic kidneys from deceased donors can be considered for transplantation.
36617405	Suspected Autosomal Recessive Polycystic Kidney Disease but Cerebellar Vermis Hypoplasia, Oligophrenia Ataxia, Coloboma, and Hepatic Fibrosis (COACH) Syndrome in Retrospect, A Delayed Diagnosis Aided by Genotyping and Reverse Phenotyping: A Case Report and A Review of the Literature.	The clinical features of cerebellar vermis hypoplasia, oligophrenia, ataxia, coloboma, and hepatic fibrosis (COACH) characterize the rare autosomal recessive multisystem disorder called COACH syndrome. COACH syndrome belongs to the spectrum of Joubert syndrome and related disorders (JSRDs) and liver involvement distinguishes COACH syndrome from the rest of the JSRD spectrum. Developmental delay and oculomotor apraxia occur early but with time, these can improve and may not be readily apparent or no longer need active medical management. Congenital hepatic fibrosis and renal disease, on the other hand, may develop late, and the temporal incongruity in organ system involvement may delay the recognition of COACH syndrome. We present a case of a young adult presenting late to a Renal Genetics Clinic for evaluation of renal cystic disease with congenital hepatic fibrosis, clinically suspected to have autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease. Following genetic testing, a reevaluation of his medical records from infancy, together with reverse phenotyping and genetic phasing, led to a diagnosis of COACH syndrome.
32866560	Targeting and therapeutic peptide-based strategies for polycystic kidney disease.	Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is characterized by progressive cyst growth and is a leading cause of renal failure worldwide. Currently, there are limited therapeutic options available to PKD patients, and only one drug, tolvaptan, has been FDA-approved to slow cyst progression. Similar to other small molecule drugs, however, tolvaptan is costly, only moderately effective, and causes adverse events leading to high patient dropout rates. Peptides may mitigate many drawbacks of small molecule drugs, as they can be highly tissue-specific, biocompatible, and economically scaled-up. Peptides can function as targeting ligands that direct therapies to diseased renal tissue, or be potent as therapeutic agents themselves. This review discusses various aberrant signaling pathways in PKD and renal receptors that can be potential targets of peptide-mediated strategies. Additionally, peptides utilized in other kidney applications, but may prove useful in the context of PKD, are highlighted. Insights into novel peptide-based solutions that have potential to improve clinical management of PKD are provided.
31391092	Yinang formulation versus placebo granules as a treatment for chronic kidney disease stages III-IV in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease: study protocol for a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial.	BACKGROUND: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is one of the most common potentially life-threatening inherited kidney diseases. It is the fourth most common cause of end-stage renal disease requiring renal replacement therapy. There are few management options for controlling disease progression. Hence, identification of alternative treatments for patients is important. The Chinese herbal yinang formulation (YNF), which is derived from a Chinese patent medicine, appears to have a satisfactory effect in treating ADPKD. Because a considerable proportion of ADPKD patients presenting with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages III-IV are diagnosed with the spleen, kidney deficiency, and blood stasis syndrome according to the diagnostic criteria of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), we hypothesize that YNF may be a complementary drug for ADPKD patients with the corresponding syndrome. Therefore, we have designed a strict clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of YNF for ADPKD patients with CKD stages III-IV exhibiting the TCM syndrome of spleen, kidney deficiency, and blood stasis. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a multi-center prospective double-blind randomized controlled trial. The total target sample size is planned to be 72 participants, with a balanced treatment allocation (1:1). The experimental intervention will be YNF plus conventional therapy and the control intervention will be a placebo plus conventional therapy for 24 weeks. An additional 24 weeks of follow-up will be conducted after treatment completion. The primary outcome will be the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Changes in total kidney volume (TKV), serum creatinine (Scr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), TCM symptoms, and pain will be the secondary outcomes. Adverse events (AEs) will be monitored throughout the trial. DISCUSSION: This study will be the first placebo-controlled randomized controlled trial to assess whether YNF plus conventional therapy has a beneficial effect on eGFR, TKV, Scr, and BUN, and whether it can alleviate TCM clinical symptoms, reduce ADPKD-related pain, and reduce the frequency of AEs for ADPKD patients with CKD stages III-IV with the spleen, kidney deficiency, and blood stasis syndrome. The results of this trial may provide an evidence-based recommendation for clinicians. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Chinese Clinical Trials Register, ChiCTR-INR-16009914 . Registered on 18 November 2016.
35369373	Utility of Peritoneal Scintigraphy in Peritoneal Dialysis Patients: One Center Experience.	Background: Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is the RRT of choice in 15% of patients with CKD and has multiple advantages over hemodialysis. PD leaks can prompt technique failure and dropout. Use of peritoneal scintigraphy (PS) for diagnosis of PD leaks has declined in favor of more complex and expensive tests. We analyzed the utility of PS for PD leak diagnosis in our center. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed all PS done in our center from January 2000 until December 2018, inclusive, in all patients on PD with a suspected dialysate leak. Results: A total of 39 PS procedures were done in 36 patients on PD in the study period. Of those, 81% were male and 11% had CKD due to polycystic kidney disease. During this period, 23 leaks were diagnosed, showing an incidence of 6% (three episodes per patient per year). In all cases with negative PS, other tests did not confirm a peritoneal dialysate leak. Conclusions: PS is a safe, inexpensive, reproducible, and highly effective diagnostic tool for peritoneal dialysate leaks that allows nephrologists to tailor or stop PD therapy if required. In our opinion, it should be the first-line imaging test to diagnose PD leaks with minimum exposure to radiation, contrast, or other substances that could irritate the peritoneal membrane. We believe PS should be considered as the initial test of choice to diagnose this PD complication as soon as possible, minimizing technique failure and dropout due to leaks.
38918734	Changes in tubular biomarkers with dietary intervention and metformin in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease: a post-hoc analysis of two clinical trials.	BACKGROUND: Tubular biomarkers, which reflect tubular dysfunction or injury, are associated with incident chronic kidney disease and kidney function decline. Several tubular biomarkers have also been implicated in the progression of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). We evaluated changes in multiple tubular biomarkers in four groups of patients with ADPKD who participated in one of two clinical trials (metformin therapy and diet-induced weight loss), based on evidence suggesting that such interventions could reduce tubule injury. METHODS: 66 participants (26 M/40 F) with ADPKD and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) >= 30 ml/min/1.73m2 who participated in either a metformin clinical trial (n = 22 metformin; n = 23 placebo) or dietary weight loss study (n = 10 daily caloric restriction [DCR]; n = 11 intermittent fasting [IMF]) were included in assessments of urinary tubular biomarkers (kidney injury molecule-1 [KIM-1], fatty-acid binding protein [FABP], interleukin-18 [IL-18], monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 [MCP-1], neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin [NGAL], clusterin, and human cartilage glycoprotein-40 [YKL-40]; normalized to urine creatinine), at baseline and 12 months. The association of baseline tubular biomarkers with both baseline and change in height-adjusted total kidney volume (HtTKV; percent change from baseline to 12 months) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR; absolute change at 12 months vs. baseline), with covariate adjustment, was also assessed using multiple linear regression. RESULTS: Mean +- s.d. age was 48 +- 8 years, eGFR was 71 +- 16 ml/min/1.73m2, and baseline BMI was 30.5 +- 5.9 kg/m2. None of the tubular biomarkers changed with any intervention as compared to placebo. Additionally, baseline tubular biomarkers were not associated with either baseline or change in eGFR or HtTKV over 12 months, after adjustments for demographics, group assignment, and clinical characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Tubular biomarkers did not change with dietary-induced weight loss or metformin, nor did they associate with kidney disease progression, in this cohort of patients with ADPKD.
28703542	[Nephrology : What's new in 2016 ?]	The first treatment which slows the course of polycystic kidney disease is now available in Switzerland. There is no benefit of immunosuppression when treating IgA nephropathy. Rituximab has been proved effective in the treatment of membranous nephropathy. When to start renal replacement therapy in acute kidney injury ? The debate still continues. In selected patients with end-stage renal failure, starting with twice a week hemodialysis is a desirable option. Peritoneal dialysis can be considered in frail patients. Better being transplanted with a HLA-incompatible living donor than to be on the waiting list. Immunosuppression without a calcineurin inhibitor is a potential immunologic hazard even for stable transplants. Long-term results of belatacept-based immunosuppression instead of cyclosporin showed better graft and patient survival but more acute rejection.
38059323	Combined liver-kidney transplantation in pediatric patients.	Combined liver-kidney transplantation (CLKT) is a surgical procedure that involves transplanting both liver and kidney organs. There are two types of CLKT: simultaneous liver-kidney transplantation (smLKT) and sequential LKT (sqLKT). CLKT accounts for a small percentage of liver transplantations (LTs), particularly in pediatric cases. Nevertheless, the procedure has demonstrated excellent outcomes, with high survival rates and lower rejection rates. The main indications for CLKT in pediatric patients differ somewhat from that in adults, in which end-stage kidney disease after LT is the major indication. In children, congenital diseases are common reason for performing CLKT; the examples of such diseases include autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease with congenital hepatic fibrosis which equally affects both organs, and primary hyperoxaluria type 1, a primary liver disease leading kidney failure. The decision between smLKT or sqLKT depends on the dominant organ failure, the specific pathophysiology, and available organ sources. However, there remain significant surgical and societal challenges surrounding CLKT. Innovations in pharmacology and genetic engineering have decreased the necessity for CLKT in early-diagnosed cases without portal hypertension or kidney replacement therapy. Nonetheless, these advancements are not universally accessible. Therefore, decision-making algorithms should be crafted, considering region-specific organ allocation systems and prevailing medical environments.
32994492	Severe neurological outcomes after very early bilateral nephrectomies in patients with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD).	To test the association between bilateral nephrectomies in patients with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) and long-term clinical outcome and to identify risk factors for severe outcomes, a dataset comprising 504 patients from the international registry study ARegPKD was analyzed for characteristics and complications of patients with very early (<= 3 months; VEBNE) and early (4-15 months; EBNE) bilateral nephrectomies. Patients with very early dialysis (VED, onset <= 3 months) without bilateral nephrectomies and patients with total kidney volumes (TKV) comparable to VEBNE infants served as additional control groups. We identified 19 children with VEBNE, 9 with EBNE, 12 with VED and 11 in the TKV control group. VEBNE patients suffered more frequently from severe neurological complications in comparison to all control patients. Very early bilateral nephrectomies and documentation of severe hypotensive episodes were independent risk factors for severe neurological complications. Bilateral nephrectomies within the first 3 months of life are associated with a risk of severe neurological complications later in life. Our data support a very cautious indication of very early bilateral nephrectomies in ARPKD, especially in patients with residual kidney function, and emphasize the importance of avoiding severe hypotensive episodes in this at-risk cohort.
26926553	Trends in Renal Transplantation Rates in Patients with Congenital Urinary Tract Disorders.	PURPOSE: Improved bladder and renal management benefit patients with congenital uropathy and congenital pediatric kidney disease. This may translate to delayed initial renal transplantation in these patients, and improved graft and patient survival. Our primary study purpose was to determine whether patients with congenital uropathy and congenital pediatric kidney disease have demonstrated later time to first transplantation and/or graft survival. MATERIALS AND METHODS: SRTR (Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients) was analyzed for first renal transplant and survival data in patients with congenital uropathy and congenital pediatric kidney disease from 1996 to 2012. Congenital uropathy included chronic pyelonephritis/reflux, prune belly syndrome and congenital obstructive uropathy. Congenital pediatric kidney disease included polycystic kidney disease, hypoplasia, dysplasia, dysgenesis, agenesis and familial nephropathy. RESULTS: A total of 7,088 patients with congenital uropathy and 24,315 with congenital pediatric kidney disease received a first renal transplant from 1996 to 2012. A significant shift was seen in both groups toward older age at initial renal transplantation in those 18 through 64 years old. In the congenital uropathy group this effect was most facilitated by decreased renal transplantion in patients between 18 and 35 years old (38% in 1996 vs 26% in 2012). The congenital pediatric kidney disease group showed a substantial decrease in patients who were 35 to 49 years old (from 39% to 29%). At 10-year followup the congenital uropathy group showed better graft and patient survival than the congenital pediatric kidney disease group. However, aged matched comparison revealed comparable survival rates in the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of trends in the last 14 years demonstrated that patients with both lower and upper tract congenital anomalies experienced delayed time to the first renal transplant. Furthermore, patients had similar age matched graft and patient survival whether the primary source of renal demise was the congenital lower or upper tract. These findings may indicate that improved urological and nephrological care are promoting renal preservation in both groups.
26141928	Autophagy in renal diseases.	Autophagy is the cell biology process in which cytoplasmic components are degraded in lysosomes to maintain cellular homeostasis and energy production. In the healthy kidney, autophagy plays an important role in the homeostasis and viability of renal cells such as podocytes and tubular epithelial cells and of immune cells. Recently, evidence is mounting that (dys)regulation of autophagy is implicated in the pathogenesis of various renal diseases, and might be an attractive target for new renoprotective therapies. In this review, we provide an overview of the role of autophagy in kidney physiology and kidney diseases. 
28072739	Risk factors and outcomes associated with a higher use of inotropes in kidney transplant recipients.	Preservation of adequate perfusion pressures to the graft is a main focus of intraoperative management during kidney transplantation. We undertook this study to investigate the incidence of the higher use of inotropes in kidney transplant recipients and identify the patient outcomes and preoperative and intraoperative variables related to this.We retrospectively analyzed 1053 patients who underwent kidney transplantation at Asan Medical Center between January 2006 and February 2012, stratified by their inotropic score ([dopamine] + [dobutamine] + [epinephrine x 100] + [norepinephrine x 100]) <7 versus >=7, wherein all doses are expressed as mug/kg/min. We evaluated preoperative characteristics, hemodynamic parameters, and intraoperative variables as well as postoperative outcomes, such as length of hospital stay and 1-year rejection and mortality rate.Receiver-operating characteristic analysis was performed to determine inotropic score to predict 1-year mortality. An inotropic score of 7 had the best combined sensitivity and specificity. An inotropic score >=7 (137 patients, 13.0%) was significantly more prevalent in older patients, those with polycystic kidney disease, and at a 2nd transplant. Anesthesia time, the amounts of crystalloid and 5% albumin infused, and the need for red blood cell transfusion were significantly higher in the inotropic score >=7 group. The patients with a higher use of inotropes required longer postoperative hospital stay and experienced a >2-fold higher rejection within the 1st year and a 4-fold higher 1-year mortality rate.A higher use of inotropes in kidney transplant recipients is more prevalent in older patients, those with a 2nd transplant and in patients with polycystic kidney disease as their primary renal disease. The postoperative hospital stay, rejection within the 1st year, and 1-year mortality rate are increased in patients with an inotropic score >=7.
32919899	Prospective evaluation of kidney and liver disease in autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease-congenital hepatic fibrosis.	"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: We have previously published the characteristics of kidney and liver disease in a cohort of 73 individuals with molecularly confirmed autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease-congenital hepatic fibrosis, based upon cross-sectional data. Here, we present prospective data on the same cohort. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, AND MEASUREMENTS: Comprehensive biochemical and imaging data on progression of kidney and liver disease in 60 of the 73 patients were prospectively collected at the NIH Clinical Center on multiple visits between 2003 and 2019. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Of the 73 patients, 23 received a renal allograft at an average age of 17.5 years and 10 underwent liver transplantation at an average age of 20.3 years. Patients who presented perinatally and those who had corticomedullary disease required kidney transplantation significantly earlier. The mean eGFR slope in patients with corticomedullary disease was -1.6 ml/min/1.73 m2/y, in comparison to -0.6 ml/min/1.73 m2/y in those with medullary disease. Kidney size remained the same over time and normalized to the upper limit of normal by 20-25 years of age. The extent of renal disease on ultrasound remained largely unchanged; no patient progressed from the ""medullary"" to the ""corticomedullary"" group. There was no correlation between eGFR slope and kidney size. The synthetic function of the liver remained largely intact even in patients with advanced portal hypertension. Based on spleen length/height ratio, two thirds of patients had portal hypertension which remained stable in 39% and worsened in 61%. Patients with portal hypertension had lower platelet counts and relatively higher levels of AST, GGT, direct bilirubin and ammonia. The progression rates of kidney and liver disease were independent of each other. Patients with bi-allelic non-truncating PKHD1 variants had similar progression of kidney and liver disease in comparison to those who were compound heterozygous for a non-truncating and a truncating variant."
37150972	Haemoperitoneum in peritoneal dialysis and polycystic kidney disease: An interesting cause.	
29779024	A Randomized Clinical Trial of Metformin to Treat Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease.	BACKGROUND: Metformin inhibits cyclic AMP generation and activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which inhibits the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator and Mammalian Target of Rapamycin pathways. Together these effects may reduce cyst growth in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). METHODS: A phase II, double-blinded randomized placebo-controlled trial of 26 months duration. Participants will include nondiabetic adults (n = 96) aged 18-60 years, with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) >=50 mL/min/1.73 m2 and ADPKD, recruited from university-based practices in Baltimore and Boston. Participants will be randomized in 1: 1 ratio to metformin or placebo at 500 mg once daily, increased every 2 weeks to a maximum of 1,000 mg twice daily as tolerated. Dose is decreased if eGFR falls to 30-45 mL/min/1.73 m2 and discontinued at eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2. RESULTS: The primary outcomes are safety, assessed by the rates of hypoglycemia, elevated lactic acid levels, adverse events, and tolerability assessed by the Gastrointestinal Severity Rating Scale and maximum tolerated dose of study medication. Secondary outcomes include changes in total kidney and liver volumes, pain, and health-related quality of life, and changes in urinary metabolomic biomarkers. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this trial will provide important information on the feasibility, safety, and tolerability of long-term use of metformin in patients with -ADPKD and provide preliminary information regarding its efficacy in slowing disease progression. Furthermore, results may support or refute the hypothesis that metformin effects on disease progression are mediated through the activation of the AMPK pathway. These results will be essential for the justification and design of a full-scale efficacy trial.
25981217	Embolization of renal arteries before transplantation in patients with polycystic kidney disease: a single institution long-term experience.	PURPOSE: We aimed to retrospectively assess the long-term safety and efficacy of embolization of renal arteries (ERA) in patients with polycystic kidney disease (PKD) before renal transplantation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between January 2008 and November 2013, 82 ERA procedures were performed on 76 kidneys in 73 patients (mean age 53 years, range: 34-72). All patients had terminal-stage PKD and were under dialysis and on the renal transplant waiting list with a temporary contraindication due to excessive renal volume. RESULTS: ERA was considered successful in 89.5% (68/76) of embolized kidneys, meaning that the temporary contraindication for transplantation could be withdrawn for 65 patients (on average 5.6 months, range: 2.8-24.3, after ERA). Mean volume reduction was 40 (range: 2-69) at 3 months and 59% (35-86) thereafter (both p < 0.001). Post-embolization syndrome occurred after 15 of 82 procedures (18.3%). The severe complication rate was 4.9%. Forty-three (67.7%) transplantations were successfully conducted after ERA, with a mean follow-up of 26.2 months (range: 1.8-59.5), and the estimated 5-year graft survival rate was 95.3% [95% CI: 82.7-98.8]. CONCLUSIONS: ERA is a safe and effective alternative to nephrectomy before renal transplantation in patients with PKD. KEY POINTS:   Embolization of non-functioning polycystic kidneys allowed transplantation in 89.5% of cases.   Technical failure rate was 7.9% after embolization, irrespective of the technique used.   Post-embolization syndrome occurred after 18.3% of the procedures.   A low rate of severe complications (4.9%) was observed after renal embolization.
28194574	Tolvaptan treatment for severe neonatal autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease.	BACKGROUND: Severe neonatal autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is rare and easily confused with recessive PKD. Managing such infants is difficult and often unsuccessful. CASE DIAGNOSIS/TREATMENT: A female infant with massive renal enlargement, respiratory compromise and hyponatraemia was treated with the arginine vasopressin receptor 2 antagonist tolvaptan. This resolved hyponatraemia, and there was no further increase in renal size. CONCLUSION: Tolvaptan may be a useful treatment for severe neonatal PKD.
30160771	Pure red cell aplasia and anti-erythropoietin antibodies in patients on hemodialysis: a report of two cases and a literature review.	INTRODUCTION: Anemia is a frequent multifactorial complication of CKD seen in patients on dialysis derived mainly from impaired erythropoietin (EPO) production. A less common cause of anemia in individuals with CKD is pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) secondary to the production of anti-EPO antibodies. OBJECTIVE: This paper aimed two describe two cases of PRCA secondary to the production of anti-EPO antibodies including choice of treatment, patient progression, and a literature review. MATERIALS: This study included the cases of two patients with CKD on hemodialysis with severe anemia in need of specific investigation and management. RESULTS: Patient 1 with CKD secondary to hypertension treated with EPO for 7 months showed persistent decreases in hemoglobin (Hb) levels despite the subcutaneous administration of increasing doses of EPO; the patient required recurring blood transfusions. Workup and imaging tests were negative for the main causes of anemia in individuals with CKD on dialysis. Patient 2 with CKD secondary to adult polycystic kidney disease had been taking EPO for 2 years. The patient developed severe abrupt anemia the month he was started on HD, and required recurring transfusions to treat the symptoms of anemia. Workup and imaging findings were inconclusive. Specific laboratory tests confirmed the patients had anti-EPO antibodies. After six months of immunosuppressant therapy (corticosteroids + cyclosporine) the patients were stable with Hb > 9.0 g/dl. CONCLUSION: PRCA is a rare condition among patients on dialysis treated with rhEPO and should be considered as a possible cause of refractory anemia. Treating patients with PRCA may be challenging, since the specific management and diagnostic procedures needed in this condition are not always readily available.
30056872	Carbohydrate Antigen 19-9 Level in Patients with Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease.	BACKGROUND: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most prevalent monogenic renal disease, responsible for 10% of the patients on renal replacement therapy, including kidney transplantation. Recently, it was reported that the serum CA 19-9 level is significantly elevated in ADPKD patients without malignancy. Exclusion of malignancy, including tumor marker analysis, is essential in pretransplant evaluation, as well as in assessment of kidney transplantation recipients. METHODS: In this study the serum CA 19-9 level in ADPKD patients without malignancy was retrospectively analyzed. The mean level of CA 19-9 was 30.3 U/mL (0.8 U/L-612 U/L). RESULTS: Overall, in 24 patients (18.8%) the serum CA 19-9 level was increased above the normal level found in the general population (35 U/L), and 5 of them (4.2%) did not experience polycystic liver disease. In 4 patients (3.4%) CA 19-9 level was increased 2-fold above the norm and in 3 of them (2.5%) 3-fold over the norm and higher. A statistically significant negative correlation between serum CA 19-9 level and estimated glomerular filtration rate, both in patients with and without hepatic cysts was observed. In nearly 1 in 5 patients with ADPKD, serum CA 19-9 level should be expected to be above the norm found in the general population, despite the lack of coexistence of a tumor or cholangitis. CONCLUSION: This finding should be considered during transplantation qualification and in follow-up examination after kidney transplantation.
30342219	Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Associated with Polycystic Kidney Disease: Endovascular Aortic Repair and Renal Embolization.	A 79-year old patient with an asymptomatic 63-mm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm, confirmed on computed tomography, was admitted in our unit. The patient had undergone kidney transplantation years before, due to renal failure secondary to polycystic kidney disease. Renal function at admission was normal. The aneurysm had a very short neck, and a standard endovascular aortic repair procedure was not feasible. Therefore, the 2 renal arteries were embolized with coils and endovascular repair of the aneurysm, covering the ostia of the renal arteries, was achieved placing the endoprosthesis up to the level of the superior mesenteric artery. The course of the patient was uneventful and was discharged without complications. Endovascular repair in patients without infrarenal aortic necks and nonfunctional kidneys secondary to polycystic kidney disease can be achieved with safety embolizing and covering the ostia of the renal arteries.
30422235	Effect of Lanreotide on Kidney Function in Patients With Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease: The DIPAK 1 Randomized Clinical Trial.	Importance: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is characterized by progressive cyst formation in both kidneys and loss of renal function, eventually leading to a need for kidney replacement therapy. There are limited therapeutic management options. Objective: To examine the effect of the somatostatin analogue lanreotide on the rate of kidney function loss in patients with later-stage ADPKD. Design, Setting, and Participants: An open-label randomized clinical trial with blinded end point assessment that included 309 patients with ADPKD from July 2012 to March 2015 at 4 nephrology outpatient clinics in the Netherlands. Eligible patients were 18 to 60 years of age and had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 30 to 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. Follow-up of the 2.5-year trial ended in August 2017. Interventions: Patients were randomized to receive either lanreotide (120 mg subcutaneously once every 4 weeks) in addition to standard care (n = 153) or standard care only (target blood pressure <140/90 mm Hg; n = 152). Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcome was annual change in eGFR assessed as slope through eGFR values during the 2.5-year treatment phase. Secondary outcomes included change in eGFR before vs after treatment, incidence of worsening kidney function (start of dialysis or 30% decrease in eGFR), change in total kidney volume and change in quality of life (range: 1 [not bothered] to 5 [extremely bothered]). Results: Among the 309 patients who were randomized (mean [SD] age, 48.4 [7.3] years; 53.4% women), 261 (85.6%) completed the trial. Annual rate of eGFR decline for the lanreotide vs the control group was -3.53 vs -3.46 mL/min/1.73 m2 per year (difference, -0.08 [95% CI, -0.71 to 0.56]; P = .81). There were no significant differences for incidence of worsening kidney function (hazard ratio, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.49 to 1.52]; P = .87), change in eGFR (-3.58 vs -3.45; difference, -0.13 mL/min/1.73 m2 per year [95% CI, -1.76 to 1.50]; P = .88), and change in quality of life (0.05 vs 0.07; difference, -0.03 units per year [95% CI, -0.13 to 0.08]; P = .67). The rate of growth in total kidney volume was lower in the lanreotide group than the control group (4.15% vs 5.56%; difference, -1.33% per year [95% CI, -2.41% to -0.24%]; P = .02). Adverse events in the lanreotide vs control group included injection site discomfort (32% vs 0.7%), injection site papule (5.9% vs 0%), loose stools (91% vs 6.6%), abdominal discomfort (79% vs 20%), and hepatic cyst infections (5.2% vs 0%). Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with later-stage autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, treatment with lanreotide compared with standard care did not slow the decline in kidney function over 2.5 years of follow-up. These findings do not support the use of lanreotide for treatment of later-stage autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01616927.
39203812	Ketogenic Interventions in Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease: A Comprehensive Review of Current Evidence.	Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) is a genetic disorder characterized by the development and enlargement of multiple kidney cysts, leading to progressive kidney function decline. To date, Tolvaptan, the only approved treatment for this condition, is able to slow down the loss of annual kidney function without stopping the progression of the disease. Furthermore, this therapy is approved only for patients with rapid disease progression and its compliance is problematic because of the drug's impact on quality of life. The recent literature suggests that cystic cells are subject to several metabolic dysregulations, particularly in the glucose pathway, and mitochondrial abnormalities, leading to decreased oxidative phosphorylation and impaired fatty acid oxidation. This finding paved the way for new lines of research targeting potential therapeutic interventions for ADPKD. In particular, this review highlights the latest studies on the use of ketosis, through ketogenic dietary interventions (daily calorie restriction, intermittent fasting, time-restricted feeding, ketogenic diets, and exogenous ketosis), as a potential strategy for patients with ADPKD, and the possible involvement of microbiota in the ketogenic interventions' effect.
25933820	Molecular pathways and therapies in autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease.	Autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most prevalent inherited renal disease, characterized by multiple cysts that can eventually lead to kidney failure. Studies investigating the role of primary cilia and polycystins have significantly advanced our understanding of the pathogenesis of PKD. This review will present clinical and basic aspects of ADPKD, review current concepts of PKD pathogenesis, evaluate potential therapeutic targets, and highlight challenges for future clinical studies. 
31261130	Clinical relevance of short-term follow-up of unruptured intracranial aneurysms.	OBJECTIVE: Unruptured intracranial aneurysms are common incidental findings on brain imaging. Short-term follow-up for conservatively treated aneurysms is routinely performed in most cerebrovascular centers, although its clinical relevance remains unclear. In this study, the authors assessed the extent of growth as well as the rupture risk during short-term follow-up of conservatively treated unruptured intracranial aneurysms. In addition, the influence of patient-specific and aneurysm-specific factors on growth and rupture risk was investigated. METHODS: The authors queried their prospective institutional neurovascular registry to identify patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms and short-term follow-up imaging, defined as follow-up MRA and/or CTA within 3 months to 2 years after initial diagnosis. Medical records and questionnaires were used to acquire baseline information. The authors measured aneurysm size at baseline and at follow-up to detect growth. Rupture was defined as a CT scan-proven and/or CSF-proven subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). RESULTS: A total of 206 consecutive patients with 267 conservatively managed unruptured aneurysms underwent short-term follow-up at the authors' center. Seven aneurysms (2.6%) enlarged during a median follow-up duration of 1 year (range 0.3-2.0 years). One aneurysm (0.4%) ruptured 10 months after initial discovery. Statistically significant risk factors for growth or rupture were autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (RR 8.3, 95% CI 2.0-34.7), aspect ratio > 1.6 or size ratio > 3 (RR 10.8, 95% CI 2.2-52.2), and initial size >= 7 mm (RR 10.7, 95% CI 2.7-42.8). CONCLUSIONS: Significant growth of unruptured intracranial aneurysms may occur in a small proportion of patients during short-term follow-up. As aneurysm growth is associated with an increased risk of rupture, the authors advocate that short-term follow-up is clinically relevant and has an important role in reducing the risk of a potential SAH.
31910463	Dialysis in Pregnancy: Role of the Underlying Cause of Renal Failure on Peripartum Outcomes.	OBJECTIVE: Pregnancy on dialysis is rare and few studies in this population exist. Currently, pregnancy outcomes are thought to be related to dialysis intensity. We hypothesize women requiring dialysis due to diabetes or lupus will have worse pregnancy outcomes compared with other indications for dialysis. STUDY DESIGN: All women receiving dialysis during pregnancy from 2012 to 2016 in a single health system were identified. Differences in perinatal outcomes among those with renal failure caused by diabetes or lupus and with other causes were evaluated. RESULTS: Sixteen women were identified, seven with diabetes or lupus causing renal failure; the remaining nine women had hypertension, focal segmental glomerular sclerosis, polycystic kidney disease, congenital hypoplastic kidneys, or neurogenic bladder. The rates of composite maternal morbidity were similar among the two groups. Composite neonatal morbidity was higher in those with renal failure caused by diabetes or lupus compared with other causes (100% vs. 29%, p = 0.028). CONCLUSION: Despite similar dialysis intensity, the composite neonatal morbidity was higher in women with renal failure caused by diabetes or lupus compared with other etiologies. Our findings suggest that pregnancy outcome in women receiving dialysis is dependent on both the intensity of dialysis as well as the etiology of renal failure.
38548511	Safety of Docetaxel in a Patient with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer After Kidney Transplantation: A Case Report.	BACKGROUND: There are limitations in treating advanced prostate cancer (PC), especially castration-resistant (CR) cases, in renal transplant recipients (RTRs). We describe the case of RTR with metastatic CRPC (mCRPC) treated with docetaxel. CASE REPORT: A 60-year-old man with end-stage renal disease due to autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) underwent living-related kidney transplantation. A year later, he was diagnosed with PC (prostate-specific antigen level: 998 ng/mL). Prostate biopsy revealed prostatic adenocarcinoma with a Gleason score of 4 + 4 = 8. Radiographic examination revealed seminal vesicle invasion and multiple bone and lymph node metastases. Combined androgen blockade therapy was initiated; however, the patient was diagnosed with CRPC 6 months later. Triweekly docetaxel therapy was administered 28 months after diagnosis. The patient successfully completed 7 cycles of this therapy without major adverse events. However, after the 7th cycle, he developed a high fever caused by an infection of ADPKD-associated renal cysts. Therefore, docetaxel was discontinued, and enzalutamide was started, followed by abiraterone, but without any effect. We then introduced cabazitaxel but discontinued it because of hepatic dysfunction. Hence, the patient underwent a docetaxel rechallenge. He was administered the PEGylated form of the recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor for neutropenia prophylaxis. After 6 cycles of rechallenge docetaxel therapy, the patient accidentally fell, resulting in a cervical spine fracture and subsequent death due to respiratory failure. CONCLUSIONS: Docetaxel can be safely delivered to patients with CRPC after renal transplantation who are taking oral immunosuppressants. It can be a good treatment option for them.
26482029	Ursodeoxycholic Acid for Treatment of Enlarged Polycystic Liver.	Patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and polycystic liver disease (PLD) often have elevated serum levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is used to treat biliary tract diseases, but its effect on PLD remains unclear. UDCA was administered for 1 year at a dose of 300 mg daily to seven PLD patients with elevated ALP or GGT levels who were selected for this treatment by experienced clinicians. Laboratory data and liver volumes were compared among three time points: 1 year before UDCA treatment, at the start of UDCA therapy, and 1 year after the start of therapy. Median GGT did not show a significant change between 1 year before UDCA (180 IU/L) and the start of UDCA therapy (209 IU/L), but it decreased significantly to 98 IU/L after 1 year of UDCA therapy (P = 0.015 vs. the start of therapy). ALP showed a significant increase from 1 year before UDCA (456 IU/L) to the start of UDCA therapy (561 IU/L), and then decreased significantly after 1 year of UDCA therapy (364 IU/L). Median liver volume did not show any significant changes among these three time points of assessment. UDCA may be effective for reducing biliary enzyme levels and inhibiting the growth of liver cysts in patients with PLD. 
29743334	Randomised controlled trial of high versus ad libitum water intake in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease: rationale and design of the DRINK feasibility trial.	"INTRODUCTION: Vasopressin stimulates cyst growth in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) leading to enlarged kidneys, hypertension and renal failure. Vasopressin receptor blockade slows disease progression. Physiological suppression of vasopressin secretion through high water (HW) intake could achieve a similar effect, necessitating a definitive large-scale trial of HW intake in ADPKD. The objective of the DRINK trial is to answer the key design and feasibility questions required to deliver a successful definitive water intake trial. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We describe the design of a single-centre, open-label, prospective, randomised controlled trial. The ""Determining feasibility of R andomisation to high vs. ad libitum water In take in Polycystic K idney Disease"" (DRINK) trial aims to enrol 50 patients with ADPKD, over the age of 16 years with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) >=20 mL/min/1.73 m2. Participants will be randomised 1:1 to HW intake based on an individualised water intake prescription, or to ad libitum (AW) water intake. The HW group will aim for a dilute urine (urine osmolality <=270 mOsm/kg) as a surrogate marker of vasopressin suppression, and those in the AW group will target more concentrated urine. Participants will have an 8-week treatment period, and will be seen at weeks 0, 2, 4 and 8, undergoing assessments of fluid status, renal function and serum and urine osmolalities. They will receive dietary advice, and self-monitor urine specific gravity and fluid intake. The trial employs smartphone technology to permit home monitoring and remote direct data capture. The primary feasibility end points are recruitment rate and separation between arms in measured urinary osmolality. Key secondary assessments include acceptability, adherence, health-related quality of life, acute effects of HW intake on measured (51Cr-EDTA) and eGFR and ADPKD-related pain. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was awarded by the East of England Essex Research Ethics Committee (16/EE/0026). The results of DRINK will be submitted to peer-reviewed journals, and presented to patients via the PKD Charity. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT02933268 and ISCRTN16794957."
28679364	Understanding barriers to medication, dietary, and lifestyle treatments prescribed in polycystic kidney disease.	BACKGROUND: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is the most common genetic renal disease and the fourth leading cause of end-stage renal disease in the United States. Although there is no cure for PKD, several treatments are considered to be beneficial, including blood pressure control, exercise, low-salt diet, and high volume water intake. However, levels of understanding of the importance of these treatments and adherence to these recommendations vary among patients. This study explores illness perception models of patients with PKD to reveal barriers in adherence to prescribed therapies; satisfaction with medical care; and sources of medical information. METHODS: We designed a phenomenological interview study to evaluate illness perception models of individuals with PKD. Patients were identified from the national PKD Foundation e-mail distribution list (N = 190) and responded voluntarily to an introductory survey (N = 50). Seventeen PKD patients in the Bay Area were scheduled for one-on-one in-depth interviews with one trained interviewer (W-CT). Open-ended questions administered with an interview guide were used to evaluate patients' beliefs. RESULTS: Mean age was 56.6 +/- 12 years (range 29-78); 65% were female. Many of the PKD patients in this study were highly motivated and willing to incorporate blood pressure, exercise, low-salt diet, and high volume water intake into their daily routines. Barriers to adherence to these therapies include personal beliefs and confusion due to unclear recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest there is variability between what patients understand about their disease and treatments and what they believe their doctors have told them. Not all physicians focus on lifestyle-based treatments, but the majority of PKD patients in our study are motivated and willing to incorporate blood pressure control, exercise, low-salt diet, and high volume water intake into their daily routines and would like specific recommendations on how to implement these. These findings support a role for further exploring patient beliefs about the disease and its necessary treatments in order to design strategies to improve communication and meet the needs of these patients.
27993381	Dietary salt restriction is beneficial to the management of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.	The CRISP study of polycystic kidney disease (PKD) found that urinary sodium excretion associated with the rate of total kidney volume increase. Whether sodium restriction slows the progression of Autosomal Dominant PKD (ADPKD) is not known. To evaluate this we conducted a post hoc analysis of the HALT-PKD clinical trials of renin-angiotensin blockade in patients with ADPKD. Linear mixed models examined whether dietary sodium affected rates of total kidney volume or change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in patients with an eGFR over 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 (Study A) or the risk for a composite endpoint of 50% reduction in eGFR, end-stage renal disease or death, or the rate of eGFR decline in patients with an eGFR 25-60 ml/min/1.73 m2 (Study B) all in patients initiated on an under100 mEq sodium diet. During the trial urinary sodium excretion significantly declined by an average of 0.25 and 0.41 mEq/24 hour per month in studies A and B, respectively. In Study A, averaged and time varying urinary sodium excretions were significantly associated with kidney growth (0.43%/year and 0.09%/year, respectively, for each 18 mEq urinary sodium excretion). Averaged urinary sodium excretion was not significantly associated with faster eGFR decline (-0.07 ml/min/1.73m2/year for each 18 mEq urinary sodium excretion). In Study B, the averaged but not time-varying urinary sodium excretion significantly associated with increased risk for the composite endpoint (hazard ratio 1.08 for each 18 mEq urinary sodium excretion) and a significantly faster eGFR decline (-0.09 ml/min/1.73m2/year for each mEq 18 mEq urinary sodium excretion). Thus, sodium restriction is beneficial in the management of ADPKD.
31752750	Idiosyncratic hepatic toxicity in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) patient in combined treatment with tolvaptan and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid: a case report.	BACKGROUND: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a hereditary disease characterized by the presence of renal cysts. Over time the expanding cysts lead to progressive renal failure. The use of tolvaptan, a V2-receptor antagonist, was recently approved in ADPKD patients. It was demonstrated that tolvaptan get slower decline in Kidney function compared with placebo. Idiosyncratic hepatic toxicity was described in patients receiving tolvaptan, with elevations in aminotransferases levels. We describe the first case reported in the literature in which hepatic toxicity is caused by the association of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and tolvaptan. CASE PRESENTATION: A 41 years old woman with diagnosis of ADPKD had been in treatment with tolvaptan for 16 weeks when an elevation of liver enzyme levels was detected. She had taken autonomously amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (in doses of 825/175 mg twice a day for 7 days) about 5 weeks before. The timing of the event and the kind of hepatocellular injury could be attributed to the concomitance of medication of tolvaptan and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. CONCLUSION: We highlight the need to careful monitor hepatic enzyme levels in order to recognize early hepatic side effects in ADPKD patients in treatment with tolvaptan and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid.
28024168	Carbohydrate antigen 19-9 is significantly elevated in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.	AIM: Liver cysts are the most common extrarenal manifestation in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) is generally used as a marker for biliopancreatic malignancies, although CA19-9 levels in patients with ADPKD are largely unknown. METHODS: A prospective observational study of 53 ADPKD patients and 83 non-ADPKD control subjects was performed. The serum levels of CA19-9 were studied to evaluate the association with clinical parameters and liver cysts. RESULTS: The serum CA19-9 levels were significantly higher in the ADPKD group than in the control group (32.9 U/mL vs. 9.8 U/mL, respectively, P < 0.001). The serum CA19-9 levels in the ADPKD group were positively correlated with the mean blood pressure (rho = 0.335, P < 0.05), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GTP) levels (rho = 0.541, P < 0.001), the largest cyst size (rho = 0.536, P < 0.001) and the liver cyst volume (rho = 0.682, P < 0.001). Multiple regression analyses showed that the gamma-GTP levels (P < 0.001) and the liver cyst volumes (P < 0.001) were independent predictors for serum CA19-9 levels. CONCLUSIONS: Serum CA19-9 levels are significantly elevated and appear to be dependent on the gamma-GTP levels and the volume of liver cysts in patients with ADPKD. Our findings indicate that the measurement of the baseline CA19-9 level in each patient with ADPKD may be useful for the interpretation of the value and the differential diagnosis of liver diseases, particularly the liver cyst infection.
37120342	A Case Report of Successful Kidney Transplantation in a Patient With Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease Who Underwent Thoracic Endovascular Aortic Repair for Type B Aortic Dissection.	BACKGROUND: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is associated with several cardiovascular disorders, including aortic dissection, which preferentially occurs at the thoracic or abdominal level. Because there are few case reports describing surgical repair for aortic dissection followed by renal transplantation in patients with ADPKD, kidney transplantation performed after repair for aortic dissection remains challenging. CASE PRESENTATION: A 34-year-old Japanese man with end-stage renal disease secondary to ADPKD underwent thoracic endovascular aortic repair for complicated acute type B aortic dissection 12 months earlier. A contrast computed tomography scan before transplantation revealed an aortic dissection involving the descending aorta proximal to the common iliac arteries and confirmed multiple large bilateral renal cysts. After simultaneous right native nephrectomy, the patient underwent preemptive living-donor kidney transplantation obtained from his mother. Intraoperatively, we noted that dissection of the external iliac vessels was difficult because of dense adhesions. Arterial clamping was performed immediately below the bifurcation of the internal iliac artery to prevent further aortic dissection of the external iliac artery. After end-to-end anastomosis to the internal iliac artery was completed and the vascular clamp was released, the kidney began to produce urine immediately. CONCLUSION: This case suggests that kidney transplantation in patients undergoing endovascular aortic repair for aortic dissection can be performed by adequately applying a vascular clamp proximal to the internal iliac artery during vascular anastomosis.
29358433	Randomised controlled trial to determine the efficacy and safety of prescribed water intake to prevent kidney failure due to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (PREVENT-ADPKD).	INTRODUCTION: Maintaining fluid intake sufficient to reduce arginine vasopressin (AVP) secretion has been hypothesised to slow kidney cyst growth in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). However, evidence to support this as a clinical practice recommendation is of poor quality. The aim of the present study is to determine the long-term efficacy and safety of prescribed water intake to prevent the progression of height-adjusted total kidney volume (ht-TKV) in patients with chronic kidney disease (stages 1-3) due to ADPKD. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A multicentre, prospective, parallel-group, open-label, randomised controlled trial will be conducted. Patients with ADPKD (n=180; age <=65 years, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) >=30 mL/min/1.73 m2) will be randomised (1:1) to either the control (standard treatment+usual fluid intake) or intervention (standard treatment+prescribed fluid intake) group. Participants in the intervention arm will be prescribed an individualised daily fluid intake to reduce urine osmolality to <=270 mOsmol/kg, and supported with structured clinic and telephonic dietetic review, self-monitoring of urine-specific gravity, short message service text reminders and internet-based tools. All participants will have 6-monthly follow-up visits, and ht-TKV will be measured by MRI at 0, 18 and 36 months. The primary end point is the annual rate of change in ht-TKV as determined by serial renal MRI in control vs intervention groups, from baseline to 3 years. The secondary end points are differences between the two groups in systemic AVP activity, renal disease (eGFR, blood pressure, renal pain), patient adherence, acceptability and safety. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The trial was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee, Western Sydney Local Health District. The results will inform clinicians, patients and policy-makers regarding the long-term safety, efficacy and feasibility of prescribed fluid intake as an approach to reduce kidney cyst growth in patients with ADPKD. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ANZCTR12614001216606.
27805523	Smoking Behaviors of Renal Transplant Recipients: An Analysis of 113 Patients.	OBJECTIVES: Smoking is the most important remediable risk factor for the progression of renal diseases. Smoking has serious adverse effects, such as cardiovascular disease, kidney function impairment, and cancer in kidney transplant recipients who are already at high risk for these diseases. In this study, our objective was to evaluate descriptive characteristics and smoking status of renal transplant recipients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated 113 patients who underwent renal transplant at Baskent University Hospital between 1990 and 2015. The medical records of all patients were retrospectively reviewed. Patient demographics, cause of renal diseases, mortality status, smoking status, and amount of smoking were recorded. RESULTS: In our study, 82 patients (72.7%) were male and 31 were female. The mean age was 38.50 +- 12.94 years. Causes of renal failure were as follows: 15.9% from hypertension, 12.4% from diabetes mellitus (all types), 8% from glomerulonephritis, 8% from vesicoureteral reflux, 6.2% from polycystic kidney disease, 17.6% other, and 31.9% unknown. Comorbid systemic disease was found in 57.6% of the patients. Fifty patients (44.2%) were current smokers, and 63 patients (55.8%) were nonsmokers. Mean age of smokers was 44.68 +- 10.60 years, with most being male patients (92.0%). There was a statistically significant difference between smoking status and sex (P < .001). The presence of comorbid diseases was significantly different between smokers and nonsmokers (P = .001). The smoking status of patients with hypertension (28.2%) was significantly different (P = .032) than others. CONCLUSIONS: Smoking cessation is associated with substantial health benefits for all smokers. For kidney transplant recipients, cigarette smoking has many adverse effects, causing cardiovascular disease and other comorbid diseases. Therefore, every attempt should be made to encourage kidney transplant candidates to stop smoking.
33877715	Liver transplantation for congenital hepatic fibrosis.	Congenital hepatic fibrosis (CHF) is a hereditary fibrocystic disease that can progress to portal hypertension and recurrent cholangitis requiring liver transplantation (LT). It can be associated with renal pathology and need for kidney transplantation (KT). We describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients undergoing liver transplantation alone (LTA) and simultaneous liver-kidney transplantation (SLKT) for CHF using the Unites States Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients. A total of 197 patients who received LT for CHF between 2002 and 2018 were identified - 87 (44.2%) received SLKT, 110 (55.8%) received LTA. The 1-, 3- and 5-year patient survival were 99.0%, 96.2% and 94.6%. The 1-, 3- and 5-year liver graft survival were 94.9%, 91.1% and 89.6%. No significant differences in patient or liver graft survival were observed between the SLKT and LTA groups, or between paediatric and adult recipients. 53.3% of patients with CHF necessitating LT also have significant renal disease requiring KT. Kidney graft survival for isolated KT prior to LT were poorer compared with KT performed simultaneously or after LT. Both LTA and SLKT for CHF are associated with excellent long-term outcomes in paediatric and adult patients.
25612237	Peritoneal Dialysis is Limited by Kidney and Liver Volume in Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease.	We evaluated the influence of kidney volume (KV) and liver volume (LV) on continuation of peritoneal dialysis (PD) in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (PKD). Twenty-two PKD patients on PD were retrospectively investigated after being divided into two groups. Group 1 comprised 15 patients who started PD at our hospital and group 2 was composed of seven patients referred from other hospitals for treatment of renomegaly by transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) at 47.1 +- 21.8 months after commencing PD. In group 1, KV for both kidneys (mean +- SD) was 2787 +- 1945 mL (range: 1043 to 6816 mL), LV was 2198 +- 1139 mL (1005 to 4116 mL), and the total organ volume (TV=KV+LV) was 4985 +- 1815 mL (2320 to 8912 mL). In the patient with the largest TV from group 1 (KV of 6816 mL, TV of 8912 mL, and TV/BMI ratio of 426, PD was stopped due to dialysate leakage. However, dialysate leakage did not occur in the other 14 patients (TV   7963 mL and TV/BMI ratio of 353 at the start of PD). In group 2, KV was 5822 +- 1597 mL (3832 to 8862 mL), LV was 1776 +- 519 mL (1271 to 2671 mL), and TV was 7597 +- 1431 mL (5505 to 10358) before TAE. Leakage of dialysate did not occur with a mean infusion volume of 1530 +- 370 mL (1000 mL to 2000 mL), even after renomegaly and hepatomegaly progressed to the maximum TV/BMI ratio of 359. Six patients from the two groups developed new abdominal hernias at 36 +- 5 months (6-55 months) after starting PD. These findings suggest that performance of PD may be limited by renomegaly and hepatomegaly in patients with PKD.
25536394	Renal artery embolization-indications, technical approaches and outcomes.	Owing to improvements in catheters and embolic agents, renal artery embolization (RAE) is increasingly used to treat nephrological and urological disease. RAE has become a useful adjunct to medical resuscitation in severe penetrating, iatrogenic or blunt renal traumatisms with active bleeding, and might avoid surgical intervention, particularly among patients that are haemodynamically stable. The role of RAE in pre-operative or palliative management of advanced malignant renal tumours remains debated; however, RAE is recommended as a first-line therapy for bleeding angiomyolipomas and can be used as a preventative treatment for angiomyolipomas at risk of bleeding. RAE represents an alternative to nephrectomy in various medical conditions, including severe uncontrolled hypertension among patients with end-stage renal disease, renal graft intolerance syndrome or autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. RAE is increasingly used to treat renal artery aneurysms or symptomatic renal arteriovenous malformations, with a low complication rate as compared with surgical alternatives. This Review highlights the potential use of RAE as an adjunct in the management of renal disease. We first compare and contrast the technical approaches of RAE associated with the various available embolization agents and then discuss the complications associated with RAE and alternative procedures. 
33879988	Laparoscopic Nephrectomy for Massive Kidneys in Polycystic Kidney Disease.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Laparoscopic nephrectomy is now considered a feasible surgical approach, even for large kidneys. In the case of massive kidneys, laparoscopy can be problematic, so that some authors suggest an open approach. However, previous studies have shown that hand-assisted laparoscopic nephrectomy (HALN) may represent a useful compromise.We describe our hand-assisted laparoscopic technique for nephrectomy of large kidneys (> 2500 g) to encourage the use of laparoscopy for nephrectomy in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data from 26 nephrectomies in 17 patients who underwent HALN for ADPKD and compared them to a group of 22 nephrectomies in 18 patients with open surgical technique. RESULTS: The duration of the procedure was significantly longer in the laparoscopic group, with a median of 180 minutes versus 90 minutes for the unilateral nephrectomies, and 240 minutes versus 122 minutes for the bilateral procedures. The median kidney weight in the open group was 2500 g (range 1300 - 4500 g), while the median weight in the HALN group was 2375 g (range 1000 - 4700 g). The median hospital stay was comparable. No significant differences were recorded in the intra- and postoperative complication rate. CONCLUSION: Hand-assisted laparoscopic nephrectomy can be considered a technique of choice for patients suffering from ADPKD requiring nephrectomy, also with massive kidneys weighing more than 3500 g. Compared to open nephrectomy, HALN can be performed safely, with reasonably longer operating times and without major complications, and offers a significant reduction in hospitalization time, pain and postoperative discomfort.

BACKGROUND: This article aims to reveal misconceptions about methods of assessment of hydration status and impact of the water disorders on the progression of kidney disease or renal dysfunction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The PubMed database was searched for reviews, meta-analyses and original articles on hydration, volume depletion, fluid overload and diagnostic methods of hydration status, which were published in English. RESULTS: Based on the results of available literature the relationship between the amount of fluid consumed, and the rate of progression of chronic kidney disease, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, and kidney stones disease was discussed. Selected aspects of the assessment of the hydration level in clinical practice based on physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging are presented. The subject of in-hospital fluid therapy is discussed. Based on available randomized studies, an attempt was made to assess, which fluids should be selected for intravenous treatment. CONCLUSIONS: There is some evidence for the beneficial effect of increased water intake in preventing recurrent cystitis and kidney stones, but there are still no convincing data for chronic kidney disease and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Further studies are needed to clarify the aforementioned issues and establish a reliable way to assess the volemia and perform suitable fluid therapy.
32705344	Simultaneous ipsilateral nephrectomy during kidney transplantation in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease: a matched pair analysis of 193 consecutive cases.	BACKGROUND: In end-stage renal transplant recipients with autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), the imperative, optimal timing, and technique of native nephrectomy remains under discussion. The Freiburg Transplant Center routinely performs a simultaneous ipsilateral nephrectomy. METHODS: From April 1998 to May 2017, we retrospectively analyzed 193 consecutive ADPKD recipients, receiving per protocol simultaneous ipsilateral nephrectomy and compared morbidity, mortality, and outcome with 193 non-ADPKD recipients of a matched pair control. RESULTS: The incidence of surgical complications was similar with respect to severe medical, surgical, urological, vascular, and wound-related complications as well as reoperation rates and 30-day mortality. Intraoperative blood transfusions were required more often in the ADPKD (22.8%) compared with the control group (6.7%; p < 0.0001). Early postoperative urinary tract infections occurred more frequent (ADPKD 40.4%/control 29.0%; p = 0.0246). Time of surgery was prolonged by 30 min (ADPKD 169 min; 95%CI 159.8-175.6 min/control 139 min; 95%CI 131.4-145.0 min; p < 0.0001). One-year patient (ADPKD 96.4%/control 95.8%; p = 0.6537) and death-censored graft survival (ADPKD 94.8%/control 93.7%; p = 0.5479) were comparable between both groups. CONCLUSIONS: With respect to morbidity and mortality, per protocol, simultaneous native nephrectomy is a safe procedure. Especially in asymptomatic ADPKD KTx recipients, the number of total operations can be reduced and residual diuresis preserved up until transplantation. In living donation, even preemptive transplantation is possible.
26640925	Anesthesia Management of a Deceased Cadaveric-Donor Combined Liver and Kidney Transplant for Primary Hyperoxaluria Type 1: Report of a Case.	Primary hyperoxaluria type 1 is an autosomal recessive disorder that is responsible for the overproduction of oxalate and has an incidence of 1 in 120 000 live births. Indications for combined liver and kidney transplant are still debated. However, combined liver and kidney transplant is preferred in various conditions, including primary hyperoxaluria, liver-based metabolic abnormalities affecting the kidney, and structural diseases affecting both the liver and the kidney, such as congenital hepatic fibrosis and polycystic kidney disease. When compared with sequential liver and kidney transplant, the rejection rate of both liver and kidney allografts was reported to be lower than with combined liver and kidney transplant. With proper anesthesia management, the probable increased complications with combined liver and kidney transplant can be prevented. In this report, we present the anesthesia care of a 22-year-old patient with primary hyperoxaluria type 1 who had deceased-donor combined liver and kidney transplant. 
26632899	Outcome Comparisons Between Patients on Peritoneal Dialysis With and Without Polycystic Kidney Disease: A Nationwide Matched Cohort Study.	Polycystic kidney disease (PCKD) is the most common hereditary cause of end-stage renal disease. The complications associated with this disease may affect the performance of peritoneal dialysis (PD). The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes between patients on PD with PCKD and without PCKD.We extracted an incident cohort of adult (>= 20 years old) patients on long-term PD from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. Patients with PCKD were identified by specific diagnosis codes. We recorded baseline comorbidities, socioeconomic status, timing of referral to a nephrologist, prior hemodialysis history before PD, and the type of PD modalities. We compared the risk of death, technique failure, peritonitis, hospitalization, and outpatient visiting as well as overall medical expenditure between the patients with PCKD and a groups of patients without PCKD who were propensity-score matched (1:3). The analysis was carried out by various Cox regression models that considered competing risk and time-varying coefficients. We enrolled 139 patients with PCKD and 7739 patients without PCKD who started long-term PD between 1999 and 2010. Patients with PCKD were less comorbid and more often treated with automated PD. In the propensity-score matched analysis, both overall survival and technique survival did not differ between the patients and the result was similar for hospitalization and peritonitis after adjusting for the application of automated PD. Furthermore, the overall annual medical expenditures were similar between the patients with and without PCKD. PD patients with PCKD are comparable to PD patients without PCKD in terms of risk of death, peritonitis, technique failure, and hospitalization in the present study. Furthermore, the medical expenses of the 2 groups after initiation of PD are also indistinguishable.
38556640	Feasibility of Water Therapy for Slowing Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease Progression.	BACKGROUND: In animal models of ADPKD, high water intake (HWI) decreases vasopressin secretion and slows disease progression, but the efficacy of HWI in human ADPKD is uncertain. METHODS: This exploratory, prospective, crossover study of ADPKD subjects (n=7) evaluated the hypothesis that HWI slows the rate of increase in height-adjusted total kidney volume (ht-TKV; a biomarker for ADPKD progression) and reduces pain. Subjects at high risk of ADPKD progression (i.e., Mayo Imaging Classifications 1C/1D) were evaluated during 6 months of usual water intake (UWI), followed by 12 months of HWI calculated to reduce urine osmolality (Uosm) to < 285 mOsm/kg. Measurements of Uosm, serum copeptin (secreted in equimolar amounts with vasopressin), MRI measurements of htTKV, and pain survey responses were compared between HWI and UWI. RESULTS: During HWI, mean 24-hour Uosm decreased compared to UWI (428 [398-432] mOsm/kg vs. 209 [190-223] mOsm/kg; p=0.01), indicating adherence to the protocol. Decreases during HWI also occurred in levels of serum copeptin (5.8+-2.0 pmol/L to 4.2+-1.6 pmol/L; p=0.03), annualized rate of increase in ht-TKV (6.8% [5.9 - 8.5] to 4.4% [3.0 - 5.0]; p<0.02), pain occurrence and pain interference during sleep (p<0.01). HWI was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: HWI in patients at risk of rapid progression of ADPKD slowed the rate of ht-TKV growth and reduced pain. This suggests that suppressing vasopressin levels by HWI provides an effective non-pharmacologic treatment of ADPKD.
34190195	Primary prevention of cardiovascular disease events with renin-angiotensin system blockade in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease dialysis patients: A nationwide cohort study.	ABSTRACT: Although renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockade has been shown to reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the general population and high-risk subjects, their protective effect in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) patients under dialysis was still unknown. By using the database from 1995 to 2008 Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (Registry for Catastrophic Illnesses), we included 387 ADPKD patients who received dialysis therapy, aged >= 18 year-old, and with no evidence of CVD events in 1997 and 1998. We utilized Cox proportional hazards regression analysis and propensity score matching to evaluate adjusted hazard ratios for all-cause mortality and CVD events in users (n=231) and nonusers (n = 156) of an angiotensin-converting enzymes inhibitor (ACEI) / angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) during the 12 years of follow-up. All study subjects were followed up for more than 3 months. There was no significant difference between the ACEI/ARB treatment group and the control group in incident CVD events except ischemic stroke and transient ischemic accident (TIA). The results remain similar between groups before and after propensity score matching. Moreover, there was no significant difference in outcomes between ACEI/ARB treatment over 50% of follow-up period and without ACEI/ARB treatment after propensity score matching. This nationwide cohort study failed to prove the protective effects of long-term ACEI or ARB on incident CVD events among APKD dialysis patients. Further larger scale, multicenter and randomized control trials are warranted to show the causal association.
29444616	Endovascular treatment of cerebral aneurysm after renal transplantation in polycystic kidney disease.	Background Patients with polycystic kidney disease have a higher prevalence of intracranial aneurysms and may progress to renal failure requiring transplantation. The endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms may improve prognosis, since rupture often causes premature death or disability, but the nephrotoxicity risk associated with contrast medium must be always considered in cases of renal impairment. Methods A 55-year-old female patient with polycystic kidney disease and grafted kidney associated with anterior communicant artery aneurysm was successfully treated by embolization. Results The renal function remained normal after the procedure. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first case of endovascular treatment of brain aneurysm in a transplanted patient reported in the medical literature. Conclusions The endovascular procedure in renal transplant patients is feasible and can be considered to treat this population. Further studies and cases are needed to confirm its safety.
37893506	Assessment of Health-Related Quality of Life in Chronic Kidney Disease Patients: A Hospital-Based Cross-Sectional Study.	Background: Health-related quality of life is rapidly becoming recognized as an important indicator of how a disease affects patient lives and for evaluating the quality of care, especially for chronic conditions such as chronic kidney disease (CKD). Objectives: This study is an attempt to assess the quality of life in patients with chronic kidney disease at MMIMSR and also identify characteristics that may be associated with their worsening quality of life. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional investigation was conducted at the in-patient department (IPD) of the MMIMSR hospital. This study included 105 CKD patients and used a systematic random sampling method for quantitative analysis. This study utilized a 36-item short-form SF-36 (v1.3) questionnaire to assess HRQoL in CKD patients. Descriptive statistics were employed at the baseline. Chi square and ANOVA were used to draw comparisons between two groups or more than two groups, respectively. Logistic regression analysis was utilized to identify the potential QoL determinants. A p value of 0.05 or lower was used to determine statistical significance. Results: Among a total of 105 participants, the mean (+-standard deviation) age was found to be 54.53 +- 13.47 years; 48 were male patients, and 57 were female patients. Diabetes Mellitus (61.9%), hypertension (56.2%), chronic glomerulonephritis (7.6%), chronic pyelonephritis (6.7%), and polycystic kidney disease (5.7%) were identified to be the most frequent disorders associated with CKD. The current study also demonstrated that the HRQoL score domains such as symptom problem list, the effect of kidney disease, and the burden of kidney disease decline significantly and progressively as the patient advances into higher stages of CKD (p = 0.005). A similar pattern was observed in work status, sleep, and general health (p < 0.005). Additionally, a statistically significant difference was noted for cognitive function, quality of social interaction, overall health, dialysis staff encouragement, patient satisfaction, social support, physical functioning, role of physical health, pain, emotional well-being, role of emotional health, social functioning, and energy fatigue (p < 0.005). The mean difference for PCS and MCS based on CKD stages was found to be statistically significant (p < 0.005). The PCS and MCS showed a positive correlation with GFR (r = 0.521), and Hb (r = 0.378), GFR (r = 0.836), and Hb (r = 0.488), respectively. Conclusions: The findings of this study demonstrated that a significant decrease in HRQoL was observed among CKD patients, with a progressive deterioration of HRQoL dimensions as the patient advances to end-stage renal disease. This study also revealed that CKD imposes various restrictions on patients' day-to-day lives, particularly in terms of their physical and mental functioning, even in the initial stages of the disease.

31605438	Use of pediatric donor en bloc kidneys along with bladder segment in pediatric liver-kidney and multivisceral-kidney transplantation.	The combination of pediatric multivisceral and kidney transplantation leads to additional recipient risks due to the number of anastomoses and to the small sizes of donor structures. The inclusion of donor kidneys, ureters, and a bladder patch en bloc with multivisceral organs decreases the number and complexity of anastomoses and has not yet been reported. Four patients were transplanted in this fashion; three underwent multivisceral-kidney and one underwent liver-kidney transplantation. The first patient was a 3-year-old male with polycystic kidney disease and congenital hepatic fibrosis. The second was a 7-year-old female with complications from necrotizing enterocolitis. The third was a 12-month-old male with megacystis microcolon intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome and secondary hydronephrosis, and the fourth was a 3-year-old male with multiple intestinal resections secondary to incarcerated hernia. The third patient developed a right ureteral stenosis with an intact bladder patch. The fourth child expired from maintained abdominal sepsis. The first 3 patients maintained normal graft function. There were no cases of thrombosis, arterial stenosis, or urinary leakages. These reported cases demonstrate that small pediatric en bloc transplantation of the multivisceral organs and dual kidneys with a bladder patch anastomosis is a feasible and less complex alternative to the standard procedure.
27555106	Kidney Versus Combined Kidney and Liver Transplantation in Young People With Autosomal Recessive Polycystic Kidney Disease: Data From the European Society for Pediatric Nephrology/European Renal Association-European Dialysis and Transplant (ESPN/ERA-EDTA) Registry.	BACKGROUND: The choice for either kidney or combined liver-kidney transplantation in young people with kidney failure and liver fibrosis due to autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) can be challenging. We aimed to analyze the characteristics and outcomes of transplantation type in these children, adolescents, and young adults. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: We derived data for children, adolescents, and young adults with ARPKD with either kidney or combined liver-kidney transplants for 1995 to 2012 from the ESPN/ERA-EDTA Registry, a European pediatric renal registry collecting data from 36 European countries. FACTOR: Liver transplantation. OUTCOMES & MEASUREMENTS: Transplantation and patient survival. RESULTS: 202 patients with ARPKD aged 19 years or younger underwent transplantation after a median of 0.4 (IQR, 0.0-1.4) years on dialysis therapy at a median age of 9.0 (IQR, 4.1-13.7) years. 32 (15.8%) underwent combined liver-kidney transplantation, 163 (80.7%) underwent kidney transplantation, and 7 (3.5%) were excluded because transplantation type was unknown. Age- and sex-adjusted 5-year patient survival posttransplantation was 95.5% (95% CI, 92.4%-98.8%) overall: 97.4% (95% CI, 94.9%-100.0%) for patients with kidney transplantation in contrast to 87.0% (95% CI, 75.8%-99.8%) with combined liver-kidney transplantation. The age- and sex-adjusted risk for death after combined liver-kidney transplantation was 6.7-fold (95% CI, 1.8- to 25.4-fold) greater than after kidney transplantation (P=0.005). Five-year death-censored kidney transplant survival following combined liver-kidney and kidney transplantation was similar (92.1% vs 85.9%; P=0.4). LIMITATIONS: No data for liver disease of kidney therapy recipients. CONCLUSIONS: Combined liver-kidney transplantation in ARPKD is associated with increased mortality compared to kidney transplantation in our large observational study and was not associated with improved 5-year kidney transplant survival. Long-term follow-up of both kidney and liver involvement are needed to better delineate the optimal transplantation strategy.
30316402	Early Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis as a Cause of Delayed Graft Function With Combined Acute Antibody Rejection: A Case Report.	Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is the most common form of post-transplant glomerulonephritis. We describe a case where a biopsy proved that early recurrence of FSGS on postoperative day 1 was the cause of delayed graft function. A 39-year-old man, on hemodialysis for 15 years due to polycystic kidney disease, received a cadaveric renal transplantation. On postoperative day 1, his hourly urine output decreased from 700-800 mL to 50 mL. The graft biopsy showed a mild acute kidney injury confusing nephrotic syndrome. On postoperative day 45, his creatinine level increased to 3.02 mg/dL with severe proteinuria. A kidney biopsy showed focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. On postoperative day 120, his creatinine level elevated again, concomitant with proteinuria. A kidney biopsy showed FSGS with antibody-mediated rejection. After plasmapheresis, his creatinine level decreased to 1.3 mg/dL with mild proteinuria. Once active in the allograft, de novo FSGS is a potentially aggressive process. In this case, it could be managed because of an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.
24676610	[Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease in hemodialysis patients in Southern Brazil].	INTRODUCTION: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is the most common hereditary renal disease in humans. OBJECTIVE: To examine the prevalence, clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients with polycystic kidneys and relate disease manifestations by gender. METHODS: This was an observational and retrospective study. All the medical records of patients with polycystic kidneys who initiated hemodialysis between 1995 and 2012, in four centers that treat patients of the coverage area of the 15th regional health Parana (Brazil), were analyzed. RESULTS: The study included 48 patients with polycystic kidneys, the primary cause of stage 5 CKD. Disease prevalence was one in 10,912 people. The average age of dialysis initiation was 50.7 years and the follow-up time on dialysis until transplantation (36.5 months) was lower among men. Hypertension was the most frequent diagnosis in 73% of patients, predominantly in women (51.4%). The liver cyst was the most frequent extrarenal manifestations in men (60.0%). The death occurred in 10.4% of patients using hemodialysis, and 60% of men. The class of antihypertensive drug used was that acts on the renin-angiotensin system with higher frequency of use among women (53.3%). The post-dialysis urea was significantly higher in men. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of the disease is low among hemodialysis patients in southern Brazil. The differences observed between genders, with the exception of the post-dialysis urea, were not significant. The findings are different from those reported in North America and Europe.
33792835	Art in the ward: nephrology picture.	
35046337	[A Case of Laparoscopic High Anterior Resection for Rectal Cancer with Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease].	The case was a 61-year-old woman. She was diagnosed with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease(ADPKD)at the age of 38 and started hemodialysis at the age of 42. She was diagnosed with rectal cancer(RS)at the age of 61. Laparoscopic high anterior resection and D3 lymphadenectomy were carried out. Although the intra-abdominal space was limited by the huge renal cysts, laparoscopic surgery can be safely performed by arranging the port closer to the midline, taking the patient's position sufficiently, and using some useful tips. Laparoscopic surgery for the patient with ADPKD was considered a useful approach.
29952039	Outcomes of patients with autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease on peritoneal dialysis: A meta-analysis.	BACKGROUND: Complications related to peritoneal dialysis (PD) in patients with autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), including intraperitoneal rupture of renal cyst, hernia, membrane failure and peritonitis, have been reported. However, long-term clinical outcomes of ADPKD patients on PD remain unclear. We performed this meta-analysis to assess the risks of death, technique failure and peritonitis in ADPKD patients on PD. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane databases from inception to October 2017 to identify studies that evaluated the outcomes of ADPKD patients on PD, including the risks of death, technique failure and peritonitis. Non-ADPKD patients on PD were used as controls. Effect estimates from the individual study were extracted and combined using the random-effect, generic inverse variance method of DerSimonian and Laird. RESULTS: Twelve cohort studies with a total of 14 673 patients on PD (931 ADPKD and 13 742 non-ADPKD patients) were enrolled. Compared with non-ADPKD status, ADPKD was associated with significantly decreased mortality risk with pooled odds ratio (OR) of 0.68 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.53-0.86; I2 = 0). There were no associations of ADPKD with the risks of technique failure of PD and peritonitis with pooled OR of 0.93 (95% CI, 0.79-1.10; I2 = 0) and 0.88 (95% CI, 0.75-1.05; I2 = 0), respectively. We found no publication bias as assessed by Egger's regression asymmetry test, with P = 0.90, 0.28 and 0.60 for the risks of mortality, technique failure and peritonitis in ADPKD patients on PD, respectively. CONCLUSION: Compared with non-ADPKD patients on PD, our study demonstrates that ADPKD patients on PD have 0.68-fold decreased mortality risk. There are no associations of ADPKD status with the risks of technique failure or peritonitis.
32312534	Application of Total Kidney Volume and Its Predictive Value in Assessment of Kidney Transplant Waitlist Candidates With Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease.	BACKGROUND: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is one of the most prevalent causes of kidney transplantation (KTx) worldwide. About 40% of ADPKD patients require peritransplant native kidney nephrectomy (NKN). The decision regarding qualification for NKN usually relies on the surgeon's expertise. Currently used qualification criteria are subjective and incomparable between clinical centers. There is a need to identify the indications for NKN by applying radiologically based methods to the decision-making process. AIM: To assess the usefulness of radiologic parameters in the qualification process of ADPKD waitlist candidates for the NKN procedure. METHOD: A retrospective, observational study in a cohort of ADPKD patients in a single institution was conducted. The study included the participation of waitlist candidates and kidney transplant recipients with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) obtained in the peritransplant period. The correlation of imaging-based measurements with the results of clinical qualification for the NKN procedure was assessed. RESULTS: In the years 2012 to 2019, 19 patients completed the inclusion criteria. Total kidney volume (TKV) values were statistically more significant in the NKN group (n = 10) than in the non-NKN group (n = 9), with medians of 3351 mL and 1654 mL, respectively (P = .016). There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of the ratio of complex cyst volume to TKV, with the NKN group having a ratio of 19.2% and the non-NKN group 15.6% (P = .095). Venous compression was found only in the NKN group (n = 2). CONCLUSIONS: TKV highly correlates with the results of clinical qualification for NKN. Radiologic assessment enables the detection of complicated cysts or clinically silent states of venous compression. Pretransplant imaging should be routinely obtained.
25165182	Renal replacement therapy for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) in Europe: prevalence and survival--an analysis of data from the ERA-EDTA Registry.	BACKGROUND: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the fourth most common renal disease requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT). Still, there are few epidemiological data on the prevalence of, and survival on RRT for ADPKD. METHODS: This study used data from the ERA-EDTA Registry on RRT prevalence and survival on RRT in 12 European countries with 208 million inhabitants. We studied four 5-year periods (1991-2010). Survival analysis was performed by the Kaplan-Meier method and by Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS: From the first to the last study period, the prevalence of RRT for ADPKD increased from 56.8 to 91.1 per million population (pmp). The percentage of prevalent RRT patients with ADPKD remained fairly stable at 9.8%. Two-year survival of ADPKD patients on RRT (adjusted for age, sex and country) increased significantly from 89.0 to 92.8%, and was higher than for non-ADPKD subjects. Improved survival was noted for all RRT modalities: haemodialysis [adjusted hazard ratio for mortality during the last versus first time period 0.75 (95% confidence interval 0.61-0.91), peritoneal dialysis 0.55 (0.38-0.80) and transplantation 0.52 (0.32-0.74)]. Cardiovascular mortality as a proportion of total mortality on RRT decreased more in ADPKD patients (from 53 to 29%), than in non-ADPKD patients (from 44 to 35%). Of note, the incidence rate of RRT for ADPKD remained relatively stable at 7.6 versus 8.3 pmp from the first to the last study period, which will be discussed in detail in a separate study. CONCLUSIONS: In ADPKD patients on RRT, survival has improved markedly, especially due to a decrease in cardiovascular mortality. This has led to a considerable increase in the number of ADPKD patients being treated with RRT.
26492429	Endovascular Treatment of Intracranial Aneurysms in Patients With Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease.	BACKGROUND: Little is known about the outcome of endovascular treatment for intracranial aneurysms in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). OBJECTIVE: To present clinical outcomes in terms of safety, effectiveness, and renal functions to assess contrast-induced nephropathy in endovascular coil embolization for intracranial aneurysms in ADPKD patients. METHODS: Nineteen ADPKD patients (female:male, 15:4; mean age, 49.8 years; range, 20-67 years) had 26 aneurysms (mean size, 5.86 mm; range, 2.5-11.6 mm) and underwent 22 endovascular treatment sessions from 2001 to 2013. Four patients presented with ruptured aneurysms. Periprocedural complications, clinical outcomes with modified Rankin Scale scores, laboratory findings, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage before and after treatment were documented. Acute renal impairment was defined as serum creatinine (Cr) elevation by >= 0.5 mg/dL or 25% relative to baseline. RESULTS: Symptomatic periprocedural complications developed after 1 endovascular procedure (1 of 22, 4.5%), and good clinical outcomes (modified Rankin Scale scores, 0-1) were achieved in 90% of patients (17 of 19). Overall, acute renal impairment occurred in 9.1% of treatment sessions (2 of 22). Acute renal impairment developed in 25% of high-risk patients (baseline Cr > 2.0 mg/dL) and 33.3% of baseline CKD stage 5 sessions but in none of the low-risk patients (baseline Cr <= 2.0 mg/dL) and in no CKD stage 1 to 4 sessions. CONCLUSION: With appropriate management, coil embolization may be safe and effective for intracranial aneurysms in ADPKD. There is a concern about contrast-induced nephropathy in patients with CKD stage 5 or high serum Cr level (>2.0 mg/dL).
32778013	Successful Liver And Kidney Transplantations From A Donor With Left Ventricular Assist Device.	Organ transplant from donors with ventricular assist devices is not common. Here, we report organ retrieval from a donor with a left ventricular assist device who had been on the heart transplant wait list before a brain death diagnosis. The organ donor was diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy and underwent left ventricular assist device surgery for bridging to heart transplant in 2016. Brain death occurred 22 months after implantation of the device at the age of 39 years due to widespread intraparenchymal and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Brain death diagnosis was confirmed with brain perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography. In accordance with the donor's will, the relatives approved organ donation. The donor's organ reserve was assessed to be suitable for liver and kidney transplants, and proper donor care was given. During recovery of organs, the organ transplant team was accompanied by cardiovascular surgeons to control flow of the left ventricular assist device and to ensure optimum organ perfusion. After a successful operation, the liver was transplanted to a patient with primary sclerosing cholangitis who had been on the wait list for liver transplant for 13 years. The kidneys were transplanted to patients awaiting kidney transplant for 31 and 14 years with diagnoses of nephrolithiasis and polycystic kidney disease, respectively. No complications occurred among the liver and kidney transplant recipients. There are few reports of donors with assist devices. This is the first case of an organ donor with an assist device waiting for an organ transplant who became an actual donor in our country.
26044834	Volume regression of native polycystic kidneys after renal transplantation.	BACKGROUND: The natural course of native kidneys after renal transplantation (RT) or dialysis in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) remains poorly understood. METHODS: We measured the total volumes of native kidneys and liver in 78 and 68 ADPKD patients, respectively, who had pre-transplant (within 2 years) and at least one post-transplant computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); in 40 patients with at least two post-transplant but no pre-transplant CT/MRIs; in 9 patients on chronic hemodialysis with at least one CT/MRI before and after beginning dialysis; and in 5 patients who had no image before and more than one image after dialysis. The last imaging was used in patients with multiple studies. RESULTS: Mean total kidney volume (TKV) ( +- SD) prior to transplantation was 3187 +- 1779 mL in the 78 patients who had imaging before and after transplantation and decreased by 20.2, 28.6, 38.3 and 45.8% after 0.5-1 (mean 0.7), 1-3 (1.8), 3-10 (5.7) and >10 (12.6) years, respectively. In the multivariable analysis, time on dialysis prior to RT and time from baseline to transplantation were negatively associated with reduction in TKV, whereas estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) after transplantation and time from transplantation were positively associated with percent reduction in TKV. In the 40 patients with imaging only after transplantation, TKV decreased by 3.2 +- 16.3% between 7.2 +- 6.0 and 11.2 +- 6.8 years after transplantation (P < 0.001). TKV was 11.2 +- 35.6% higher (P = NS) after a follow-up of 3.4 +- 2.0 years in the 9 patients with imaging before and after initiation of hemodialysis and 3.4 +- 40.2% lower (P = NS) in the 5 patients with imaging between 2.0 +- 2.1 and 3.5 +- 3.6 years after initiation of hemodialysis. In the 68 patients with liver measurements, volume increased by 5.8 +- 17.9% between baseline and follow-up at 3.7 +- 3.8 years after transplantation (P = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: TKV of native polycystic kidneys decreases substantially after RT. The reduction occurs mainly during the early post-transplantation period and more slowly thereafter.
26946416	The spectrum of renal involvement in male patients with infertility related to excretory-system abnormalities: phenotypes, genotypes, and genetic counseling.	BACKGROUND: While reproductive technologies are increasingly used worldwide, epidemiologic, clinical and genetic data regarding infertile men with combined genital tract and renal abnormalities remain scarce, preventing adequate genetic counseling. METHODS: In a cohort-based study, we assessed the prevalence (1995-2014) and the clinical characteristics of renal disorders in infertile males with genital tract malformation. In a subset of 34 patients, we performed a detailed phenotype analysis of renal and genital tract disorders. RESULTS: Among the 180 patients with congenital uni- or bilateral absence of vas deferens (CU/BAVD), 45 (25 %) had a renal malformation. We also identified 14 infertile men with combined seminal vesicle (SV) and renal malformation but no CU/BAVD. Among the 34 patients with detailed clinical description, renal disease was unknown before the assessment of the infertility in 27 (79.4 %), and 7 (20.6 %) had chronic renal failure. Four main renal phenotypes were observed: solitary kidney (47 %); autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD, 0.6 %); uni- or bilateral hypoplastic kidneys (20.6 %); and a complex renal phenotype associated with a mutation of the HNF1B gene (5.8 %). Absence of SV and azoospermia were significantly associated with the presence of a solitary kidney, while dilatation of SV and necroasthenozoospermia were suggestive of ADPKD. CONCLUSION: A dominantly inherited renal disease (ADPKD or HNF1B-related nephropathy) is frequent in males with infertility and combined renal and genital tract abnormalities (26 %). A systematic renal screening should be proposed in infertile males with CU/BAVD or SV disorders.

34670427	A First Report of HCTZ and Dicyclomine Induced Uncharacteristic Contraction Alkalosis.	BACKGROUND: Contraction alkalosis is characterized by low serum sodium and chloride and high serum carbon dioxide and bicarbonate levels. CASE REPORT: A 28-year-old Caucasian active-duty male with a history of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and diarrhea-predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome (D-IBS) presented to his primary care provider (PCP) with elevated blood pressure (136/96 mmHg), was diagnosed with stage-2 hypertension, and started oral HCTZ (25 mg/day). His medications included dicyclomine (10 mg oral three times daily). Subsequently, (Visit 1), his blood pressure was 130/91 mmHg and he was started on telmisartan (20 mg/day). At Visit 2, 4 weeks later, his blood pressure improved (121/73 mmHg); however, blood chemistry revealed elevated serum CO2 (32 mEq/L) and chloride (94 mmol/L). Four days later, the patient presented to the Emergency Department with dyspnea and swallowing difficulty. The patient returned to his PCP 3 days later complaining of cough, congestion, vomiting, and mild dyspnea, blood pressure of 124/84 mmHg. Two months later, sudden onset of projectile vomiting and abdominal pain while running was reported, resolved by rehydration and a single oral dose of prochlorperazine 25 mg. Three months later, (Visit 3), he complained of lightheadedness and cloudy judgment, suggesting contraction alkalosis. HCTZ was discontinued and telmisartan was increased to 20 mg twice daily. A follow-up blood chemistry panel 2 weeks later revealed serum chloride and CO2 levels within normal limits and blood pressure under 130/80 mmHg. CONCLUSION: This is the first known report of contraction alkalosis driven by drug-drug interaction between dicyclomine and HCTZ.
31680424	Hemodialysis-associated soft tissue amyloidomas of the chest and abdominal wall.	Amyloidoma is a highly unusual presentation of amyloidosis in tumoral or nodular form. Isolated soft tissue amyloidomas in individuals with end-stage renal disease on chronic hemodialysis is exceedingly rare, particularly in the era of advanced dialysis technologies. We report the case of a 55-year-old male with end-stage renal disease due to autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease, on HD for over 30 years, who was found to have soft-tissue, dialysis-related (beta2 -microglobulin) amyloidomas (DRA). He presented with painful, palpable masses within the thoracic and abdominal walls. Serum beta2 -microglobulin level was only mildly elevated at 24.9 mg/L. Biopsy confirmed amyloidosis with positivity for Congo Red staining and apple-green birefringence under polarized light. Amyloid subtyping with immunohistochemistry showed positive beta2 -microglobulin staining within the deposits. Conservative therapy involving pain management and close monitoring resulted in eventual improvement in symptoms and thus proved to be a viable option for treatment.

37121861	Kidney Transplantation After Renal Transcatheter Arterial Embolization for Cyst Infection in a Hemodialysis Patient With Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease: A Case Report.	A 31-year-old woman with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) required antibiotic therapy for repeated renal cyst infections. The patient was scheduled for a living donor renal transplant with her mother as the donor. Two months before surgery, the patient was admitted to the hospital due to a severe renal cyst infection that improved with antibiotic treatment and percutaneous drainage, but the scheduled surgery was postponed. Transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) was performed to control repeated renal cyst infections. Seven months after TAE, the patient underwent living donor renal transplantation. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged from the hospital on immunosuppressive medication 26 days after surgery with no evidence of recurrent infection or deterioration of renal function. Thirty months after transplantation, there has been no recurrence of infection.
29369972	mTOR Inhibition and Kidney Diseases.	Mammalian or mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine-threonine kinase that plays essential roles in cell growth, proliferation, metabolism, and survival. Increased activation of the mTOR pathway is observed in patients and animal models of renal transplant rejection, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, renal cell carcinoma, diabetic nephropathy, lupus nephritis, and angiomyolipoma. Agents that inhibit mTOR, such as sirolimus and everolimus, are incorporated in immunosuppressive regimens to prevent renal allograft rejection and are often used to facilitate calcineurin inhibitor minimization or to reduce the incidence of tumor recurrence. There are data from basic or animal studies to suggest that sirolimus and its analogs may also benefit patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and metabolic- or immune-mediated renal diseases through its ability to reduce glomerular hypertrophy, renal parenchymal inflammation and fibrosis, but translation into clinical use has proved challenging. This review summarizes the current understanding of mTOR signaling pathway under physiological and pathological conditions and recent findings on mTOR inhibitors in the management of kidney transplantation and nontransplant kidney diseases.
26620095	Suitability of Patients with Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease for Renal Transcatheter Arterial Embolization.	In patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), massive renal enlargement is a serious problem. Renal transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) can reduce renal volume (RV), but effectiveness varies widely, and the reasons remain unclear. We investigated factors affecting renal volume reduction rate (RVRR) after renal TAE in all 449 patients with ADPKD who received renal TAE at Toranomon Hospital from January of 2006 to July of 2013, including 228 men and 221 women (mean age =57.0+-9.1 years old). One year after renal TAE, the RVRR ranged from 3.9% to 84.8%, and the least squares mean RVRR calculated using a linear mixed model was 45.5% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 44.2% to 46.8%). Multivariate analysis using the linear mixed model revealed that RVRR was affected by the presence of large cysts with wall thickening (regression coefficient [RC], -6.10; 95% CI, -9.04 to -3.16; P<0.001), age (RC, -0.82; 95% CI, -1.03 to -0.60; P<0.001), dialysis duration (RC, -0.10; 95% CI, -0.18 to -0.03; P<0.01), systolic BP (RC, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.19 to 0.59; P<0.001), and the number of microcoils used for renal TAE (RC, 1.35; 95% CI, 0.83 to 1.86; P<0.001). Significantly more microcoils were needed to achieve renal TAE in patients with younger age and shorter dialysis duration. In conclusion, cyst wall thickening had an important effect on cyst volume reduction. Renal TAE was more effective in patients who were younger, had shorter dialysis duration, or had hypertension, parameters that might associate with cyst wall stiffness and renal artery blood flow.
38010035	Beyond Loss of Kidney Function: Patient Care in Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD).	ADPKD patients benefit from specialized care over their lifetimes, starting with diagnosis of the condition with ongoing discussion of both the renal course and extra-renal issues. Both renal and extra-renal issues may continue to cause major morbidity even after successful kidney transplant or initiation of renal replacement therapy and extra-renal disease aspects should always be considered as part of routine management. In this review we will focus on updates in pain/depression screening, cardiac manifestations, liver and pancreatic cysts, kidney stone management and genetic counseling. In some instances, we have shared our current clinical practice rather than an evidence-based guideline. We anticipate more standardization of care following the release of the KDIGO guidelines for management in ADPKD later this year.
32385688	Laparoscopic ureterolithotomy, flexible ureteroscopic lithotripsy and percutaneous nephrolithotomy for treatment of upper urinary calculi in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.	OBJECTIVES: Patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) showed relatively high incidence of urinary stones. Enlarged kidneys occupied by cysts could make the stone-removal surgery relatively difficult. This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of retroperitoneal laparoscopic ureterolithotomy (RPLU), flexible ureteroscopic lithotripsy (FURL) and percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) in the ADPKD patients with upper urinary stones. METHODS: In this study, 45 patients with ADPKD who underwent RPLU, FURL and PCNL procedures were evaluated. Demographic and serum parameters, stone features, outcomes and complications were analyzed. RESULTS: 45 patients were included in the present study, 13 received RPLU, 21 received FURL, and 11 received PCNL. There were no significant differences in demographic and serum parameters between the three groups. Stone-free rates of the three approaches are 100%, 85.7% and 90.9%, respectively. Patients who underwent FURL had shorter mean operative time and postoperative hospital stay. Compared to RPLU and PCNL, FURL resulted in fewer complications, but the difference is statistically non-significant. CONCLUSIONS: RPLU, FURL and PCNL are commonly used surgical methods to solve upper urinary calculi in ADPKD patients and could achieve satisfactory stone clearance. Among them, FURL showed a relative high safety and faster recovery.
32921320	The effect of energy restriction on development and progression of chronic kidney disease: review of the current evidence.	Energy restriction (ER) has anti-ageing effects and probably protects from a range of chronic diseases including cancer, diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Specifically, ER has a positive impact on experimental kidney ageing, CKD (diabetic nephropathy, polycystic kidney disease) and acute kidney injury (nephrotoxic, ischaemia-reperfusion injury) through such mechanisms as increased autophagy, mitochondrial biogenesis and DNA repair, and decreased inflammation and oxidative stress. Key molecules contributing to ER-mediated kidney protection include adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase, sirtuin-1 and PPAR-gamma coactivator 1alpha. However, CKD is a complex condition, and ER may potentially worsen CKD complications such as protein-energy wasting, bone-mineral disorders and impaired wound healing. ER mimetics are drugs, such as metformin and Na-glucose co-transporter-2 which mimic the action of ER. This review aims to provide comprehensive data regarding the effect of ER on CKD progression and outcomes.
30771042	Initial experience with the use of tris-acryl gelatin microspheres for transcatheter arterial embolization for enlarged polycystic liver.	PURPOSE: To assess the safety and effectiveness of transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) with tris-acryl gelatin microspheres for patients with symptomatic enlarged polycystic liver disease (PCLD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study was approved by our hospital's institutional review board and planned for patients with symptoms related to enlarged PCLD, such as distended abdomen, gastrointestinal obstruction and abdominal pain. Hemi-hepatic embolization with tris-acryl gelatin microspheres was performed in the hepatic artery supplying the hepatic lobe that showed the predominant presence of cysts. Each patient underwent an assessment of liver function, a questionnaire survey about symptoms, measurement of the estimated volume of the whole liver before and after TAE, and an assessment of complications associated with TAE. RESULTS: Five patients (four females, one male; mean age 52.6 +- 9.1 years) were treated. All five patients successfully completed TAE. The left lobe was treated in three patients and the right in two. After TAE, post-embolization syndrome and transient elevation of white blood cells, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase occurred in all patients, but none developed hepatic insufficiency or severe complications. The mean whole liver volume was 7406 +- 2323 mL before TAE, and 6995 +- 2139 mL (95.1 +- 5.2% of the pre-therapeutic value) at 3 months and 6855 +- 2246 mL (93.3 +- 9.7%) at 12 months after TAE. Three of the five patients reported an improvement of clinical symptoms within 12 months after TAE. CONCLUSION: TAE with microspheres can be a safe and effective treatment for symptomatic enlarged PCLD.
27257690	Simultaneous Native Nephrectomy and Kidney Transplantation in Patients With Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease.	INTRODUCTION: To evaluate the feasibility of simultaneous unilateral nephrectomy with kidney transplantation and to determine the effect of this procedure on perioperative morbidity and mortality and graft and patient survival. METHODS: Between January 2000 and May 2015, 145 patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) underwent kidney transplantation. Of those, 40 (27.5%) underwent concurrent ipsilateral native nephrectomy (group NT). Patients in group NT were compared with patients with ADPKD not undergoing concurrent nephrectomy (group NT-) and asymptomatic patients undergoing pretransplant nephrectomy (group PNT). RESULTS: The average follow-up was 66 months. The graft survival rate at 1 and 5 years was 95% and 87.5% versus 93% and 76.2% in the NT and NT- groups, respectively (P = .903 and P = .544, respectively); 1-year patient survival was 100% for NT and 97% for NT- patients (P = .288), whereas 5-year patient survival was 100% and 92% for NT and NT- groups, respectively (P = .128). After propensity score matching (34 patients per group) no significant differences were observed in 1-year (97.1% in NT and 94.1%; P = 1) and 5-year (88.2% in NT and 91.2% in NT-; P = 1) graft survival, and in 1-year (100% for both groups; P = 1) and 5-year (100% in NT and 94.1% in NT-; P = 1) patient survival. Perioperative mortality was 0% among NT and 1.2% among NT- patients, whereas perioperative surgical complications were similar in both groups. One- and 5-year graft and patient survival were similar between the NT and PNT groups, but patients in the PNT group had significantly lower levels of hemoglobin and residual diuresis volumes at the time of transplant. Moreover, PNT patients had a longer pretransplant dialysis and a longer time on the waiting list. CONCLUSIONS: Simultaneous unilateral nephrectomy does not have a negative effect on patient and graft survival in patients with ADPKD and is associated with low morbidity. Pretransplant nephrectomy should be restricted only to highly symptomatic patients, whereas unilateral nephrectomy in asymptomatic patients should be performed during kidney transplantation only if massive kidney size precludes graft positioning.
26759329	Long-term functional results of aspiration and sclerotherapy with ethanol in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease: a non-randomized pilot clinical study.	PURPOSE: To evaluate the long-term effect of aspiration and sclerotherapy treatment on the pain control, blood pressure regulation, and quality of life (QoL) in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic disease (ADPKD). METHODS: Twenty-five ADPKD patients with a total of 32 dominant cysts were treated with ultrasound guidance percutaneous aspiration and 96% ethanol injection, between 2002 and 2014. Twenty-one dominant cysts of 16 patients who had a minimum of 10-year follow-up were included in this study. The level of pain [visual analog score (VAS)], narcotic usage, blood pressure and serum creatinine level, QoL questionnaire, and radiological dominant cyst size was evaluated before and after procedure, retrospectively. RESULTS: The mean dominant cyst size was even smaller after follow-up of 10 years. Mean dominant cyst size was 7.2 +- 2.3 cm before the procedure and 0.9 +- 0.9 and 3.3 +- 1.2 cm after the one- and 10-year follow-ups, respectively (p < 0.05). VAS and QoL scores were improved after 10 years of follow-up. There was no relation between cyst size and VAS score as well as QoL questionnaire score. End-stage renal disease occurred in 50%, and there was no significant improvement in blood pressure of these patients. CONCLUSIONS: Aspiration and sclerotherapy with ethanol is a minimal-invasive, safe, and inexpensive outpatient treatment method with acceptable short- and long-term results in ADPKD patients. Aspiration and sclerotherapy with ethanol can be an option for patients with ADPKD.
34755831	Dietary Interventions in Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease.	Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is characterized by the progressive growth of renal cysts, leading to the loss of functional nephrons. Recommendations for individuals with ADPKD to maintain a healthy diet and lifestyle are largely similar to those for the general population. However, recent evidence from preclinical models suggests that more tightly specified dietary regimens including caloric restriction, intermittent fasting, and ketogenic diets hold promise to slow disease progression, and the results of ongoing human clinical trials are eagerly awaited. These dietary interventions directly influence nutrient signalling and substrate availability in the cystic kidney, while also conferring systemic metabolic benefits. The present review focuses on the importance of local and systemic metabolism in ADPKD and summarizes current evidence for dietary interventions to slow disease progression and improve quality of life.
34486280	[Kidney transplantation from Covid-19 positive deceased donor: what are the consequences for recipients?]	INTRODUCTION: In recent months, with the spread of COVID 19, the number of kidney transplants from deceased donors has declined significantly in most countries. One of the reasons is the possibility of infection of the recipient with SARS-CoV-2. Determining the risk of transmission of COVID 19 with a donor organ is very important for developing a kidney transplantation policy during a pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHOD: We present cases of kidney transplantation from COVID 19 positive deceased donor to two dialysis patients in single center. Deceased donor: a 45 years old man with diabetes, who had a major hemorrhagic stroke resulting in brain death. He had normal urine output and serum creatinine level for last 24 hours before kidney harvesting. For a few hours after organ harvesting, the donor was diagnosed COVID 19 (retrospective nasopharyngeal swab rRT-PCR which was confirmed by morphological examination and RNA-PCR of specimens from the trachea and bronchus). Recipient 1: a 49 years old man with polycystic kidney disease had been on hemodialysis for 28 months. He was in urgent list because of problems with vascular access. So non identical ABO (0-donor, B-recipient) kidney transplantation from this deceased donor was done in May 2020. Recipient 2: a 45 years old man with polycystic kidney disease on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). was registered on urgent waiting list because of low transport capacity of peritoneum. Kidney transplantation from the same deceased donor was done at the same time. In both cases we completely abandoned any antilymphocytic agents for induction, despite non ABO identical transplantation in one of the recipients and the delayed graft function. Both patients received only basic immunosuppression, including tacrolimus, methylprednisolone and a mycophenolic acid. RESULTS: In first case cold ischemia time was 22 hours. The recipient had delayed graft function with increasing of urine output on day 8 post-transplant. No other deviations from the usual course were seen during hospital stay. The patient was discharge from hospital with serum creatinine level 122 mkmol/L. The cold ischemia time was 21 hours in another patient. Graft function was immediate with a decrease serum creatinine to 92.5 mkmol/L at discharge. Both patients had no febrile and no other symptoms of acute respiratory disease during all hospital stay. No abnormalities on chest X-ray were seen. No serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG were detected before and during 6 weeks after surgery. Repeated nasopharyngeal swabs rRT-PCR were negative during all the period. Both recipients were discharged for 5 weeks after surgery to prevent out-of-hospital contamination of COVID 19, which would be difficult to differentiate from transmission infection. After 9 months both patients are doing well with no clinical or laboratory signs of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Today we have no evidence of the possibility of transmission of COVID-19 from a SARS-Cov-2 positive donor to a kidney recipient. We also have no reason to suspect kidney damage by COVID-19 in a deceased donor at normal serum creatinine level. Avoiding the use of anti-lymphocyte drugs for induction of immunosuppression may also reduce the risk of developing COVID19 after transplantation. A careful collection and analysis of such dates is necessary to develop modern practical recommendations for transplant centers.
35305055	En bloc excision of giant polycystic liver with hepatic cava and its auto-transplant caval reconstruction as a safe surgical procedure for liver transplantation.	Safely excising a giant liver while leaving the hepatic inferior vena cava intact is difficult. Hata et al. present images and videos describing their novel technique consisting of total hepatectomy including the hepatic cava; extracorporeal retrieval; and auto-transplant inferior vena cava reconstruction, for an extremely enlarged polycystic liver weighing 24 kg.
25733043	Ultrasound-guided percutaneous drainage and sclerotherapy in a patient with isolated autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease.	Isolated polycystic liver disease (IPLD) is a rare genetic condition characterized by the presence of multiple liver cysts with no association with polycystic kidney disease. Most patients are asymptomatic and acute complications (cyst torsion, bleeding, infection) are uncommon.Imaging techniques, including abdominal ultrasounds, computerized axial tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, represent a vital diagnostic modality. They are also useful for therapy support in this disease. Below we report a peculiar case of a female patient recentlydiagnosed with IPLD who, having received treatment with ultrasoundguided percutaneous drainage and sclerotherapy for a giant liver cyst, showed symptom and laboratory improvement. 
31926741	Nonopportunistic Pneumonia After Kidney Transplant: Risk Factors Associated With Mortality.	BACKGROUND: The second most common infection after kidney transplantation is pneumonia, which has a high complication rate, sometimes even resulting in death. The aim of this study was to identify risk factors associated with mortality in nonopportunistic pneumonia. METHODS: We retrospectively studied all kidney transplant recipients with nonopportunistic pneumonia treated at the University Hospital Frankfurt, Germany, between 2004 and 2017. Patient baseline characteristics, laboratory values, and microbiologic tests were analyzed. We focused specifically on acute and chronic graft failure and the immunosuppressive regimen and included a follow-up period of 7.8 years. RESULTS: One hundred seventy-seven patients (12%) collectively had 270 episodes of pneumonia. Although immunosuppressive therapy was reduced in 42% of patients during infection, there was no increase in graft rejection during hospital stay and follow-up. Significant risk factors for mortality were C-reactive protein > 10 mg/dL and serum albumin < 3 g/dL on admittance, congestive heart failure, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease as the underlying renal disease, nosocomial pneumonia, septic shock, intensive care unit admittance, mechanical ventilation, and renal replacement therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Using these factors, patients at risk for death can be identified and the outcome of those might be improved by close monitoring and modified therapies.
28379536	Multicenter, open-label, extension trial to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of early versus delayed treatment with tolvaptan in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease: the TEMPO 4:4 Trial.	Background: In TEMPO 3:4, the vasopressin V2 receptor antagonist tolvaptan slowed total kidney volume (TKV) growth and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline relative to placebo. Methods: TEMPO 4:4 was designed to provide an additional 2 years of data on the long-term safety and efficacy of tolvaptan in subjects completing TEMPO 3:4. The objective was to assess the disease-modifying effects of tolvaptan on TKV and eGFR end-points including change from baseline over the combined duration of TEMPO 3:4 and TEMPO 4:4, and non-inferiority of slopes during TEMPO 4:4. Results: Of the 1445 subjects randomized to TEMPO 3:4, 871 (60.3%) enrolled in TEMPO 4:4. Percent changes in TKV from TEMPO 3:4 baseline to TEMPO 4:4 Month 24 were 29.9% and 31.6% (prior tolvaptan versus prior placebo, P = 0.38). Adjusting for baseline covariates improved the TKV treatment difference at Month 24 in TEMPO 4:4 from -1.70% to - 4.15% between the groups (P = 0.04). Slopes of TKV growth during TEMPO 4:4 were higher in early- versus delayed-treatment groups (6.16% versus 4.96% per year, P = 0.05). Analysis of secondary eGFR endpoints demonstrated a persistent effect on eGFR (3.15 mL/min/1.73 m2, P < 0.001), and non-inferiority in eGFR slopes. The safety profile on exposure to tolvaptan in TEMPO 4:4 was similar to that in TEMPO 3:4. Conclusions: The results of TEMPO 4:4 support a sustained disease-modifying effect of tolvaptan on eGFR. The lack of a sustained treatment difference on TKV may be accounted for by limitations of the trial design, including loss of randomization and baseline imbalances ensuing TEMPO 3:4. The safety profile was similar to that observed in TEMPO 3:4.
32029758	Prognosis of Vascular Access in Haemodialysis Patients with Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease.	Vascular diseases are commonly observed in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). We aim to investigate the differences in the risk for arteriovenous fistula or graft (AVF/AVG) dysfunction in haemodialysis (HD) patients with and without ADPKD. 557 ADPKD and 1671 non-ADPKD patients were enrolled in the study after propensity score matching. The primary outcome measure is the incidence rate of AVF/AVG dysfunction. The incidence rates and risks of AVF/AVG dysfunction (per 100 person-years) for ADPKD and non-ADPKD patients were (1) 38.83 and 48.99 [SHR = 0.79, P = 0.137], respectively, for within 90 days, (2) 45.85 and 51.31 [SHR = 0.90, P = 0.300], respectively, for within 180 days, (3) 44.42 and 41.40 [SHR = 1.08, P = 0.361], respectively, for within the first year, (4) 27.38 and 24.69 [SHR = 1.09, P = 0.168], respectively, for within 5 years, (5) 17.35 and 13.80 [SHR = 1.19, P = 0.045], respectively, for between the 1st and 10th year, and (6) 25.40 and 21.22 [SHR = 1.14, P = 0.031], respectively, for all periods. ADPKD patients had lower incidence rates of AVF/AVG dysfunction within the first 180 days than non-ADPKD patients, but presented a higher incidence rate after 1 year of AVF/AVG creation and onwards.
25735085	[New strategy for the treatment of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease].	
27477416	Dialysis-induced Subdural Hematoma in an Arachnoid Cyst Associated with Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease.	Arachnoid cyst (AC) is a neurological complication of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Although an AC can increase the risk of a subdural hematoma, the clinical presentation of bleeding into an AC associated with ADPKD is not well known. We herein report the case of a 59-year-old woman in whom the initiation of hemodialysis for renal failure led to AC bleeding. A change of anticoagulant from heparin to nafamostat mesilate allowed dialysis to continue without rebleeding. These findings suggest that hemodialysis in patients with an AC associated with ADPKD may increase the risk of bleeding. Nafamostat mesilate may be useful in such cases. 
33435916	Contemporary incidence and risk factors of post transplant Erythrocytosis in deceased donor kidney transplantation.	BACKGROUND: Post-Transplant erythrocytosis (PTE) has not been studied in large recent cohorts. In this study, we evaluated the incidence, risk factors, and outcome of PTE with current transplant practices using the present World Health Organization criteria to define erythrocytosis. We also tested the hypothesis that the risk of PTE is greater with higher-quality kidneys. METHODS: We utilized the Deceased Donor Study which is an ongoing, multicenter, observational study of deceased donors and their kidney recipients that were transplanted between 2010 and 2013 across 13 centers. Eryrthocytosis is defined by hemoglobin> 16.5 g/dL in men and> 16 g/dL in women. Kidney quality is measured by Kidney Donor Profile Index (KDPI). RESULTS: Of the 1123 recipients qualified to be in this study, PTE was observed at a median of 18 months in 75 (6.6%) recipients. Compared to recipients without PTE, those with PTE were younger [mean 48+-11 vs 54+-13 years, p < 0.001], more likely to have polycystic kidney disease [17% vs 6%, p < 0.001], have received kidneys from younger donors [36 +-13 vs 41+-15 years], and be on RAAS inhibitors [35% vs 22%, p < 0.001]. Recipients with PTE were less likely to have received kidneys from donors with hypertension [16% vs 32%, p = 0.004], diabetes [1% vs 11%, p = 0.008], and cerebrovascular event (24% vs 36%, p = 0.036). Higher KDPI was associated with decreased PTE risk [HR 0.98 (95% CI: 0.97-0.99)]. Over 60 months of follow-up, only 17 (36%) recipients had sustained PTE. There was no association between PTE and graft failure or mortality, CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of PTE was low in our study and PTE resolved in majority of patients. Lower KDPI increases risk of PTE. The underutilization of RAAS inhibitors in PTE patients raises the possibility of under-recognition of this phenomenon and should be explored in future studies.
29224797	Kidney Transplantation With and Without Native Nephrectomy for Polycystic Kidney Disease: Results of the National Inpatient Sample and the Rationale for a 2-Staged Procedure.	BACKGROUND: Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is one of the most common causes of end-stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis or transplantation. In patients requiring transplantation, there are several indications for native nephrectomy, including recurrent cyst infection, bleeding, or to provide room for the graft. There is disagreement about whether it is advisable to perform kidney transplantation alone (KT), or to perform KT with simultaneous native nephrectomy (KTN). We compared postoperative outcomes of KTN and KT in a large national cohort. STUDY DESIGN: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) between 2000 and 2014 was examined for a diagnosis of PKD with evidence for KT or KTN. Logistic regression, adjusting for age, sex, comorbidity, and hospital region, was used to compare groups for the need for blood transfusion, need for critical care interventions, and development of postoperative complications. RESULTS: A total of 4,003 hospitalizations were identified, which was representative of 19,302 weighted discharges nationally. In adjusted logistic regression models, KTN demonstrated significantly higher risk for blood transfusion (odds ratio [OR] 2.06; 95% CI 1.44 to 2.96; p < 0.0001), postoperative complications (OR 1.44; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.96; p = 0.02), and critical care interventions (OR 1.44; 95% CI 1.07 to 1.95; p = 0.02). Other significant predictors for blood transfusion included female sex (OR 1.76; 95% CI 1.45 to 2.13; p < 0.0001), age older than 61 years (OR 1.60; 95% CI 1.21 to 2.10; p = 0.001), and Charlson comorbidity score >=2 (OR 1.52; 95% CI 1.10 to 2.09; p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with PKD, in comparison with KTN, KT alone represents a decreased risk for negative postoperative outcomes. A 2-staged procedure should be considered, when feasible, to minimize adverse patient outcomes.
24806835	Liver disease in autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease: clinical characteristics and management in relation to renal failure.	OBJECTIVES: We correlated liver and kidney manifestations in a national cohort of patients with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD). METHODS: A total of 27 consecutive patients with ARPKD were included. Hepatobiliary disorders were comparatively evaluated in 2 groups: children in group 1 (n = 10) displayed renal failure as infants and those in group 2 (n = 17) had normal kidney function through the first year of life. RESULTS: Median follow-up time was 10.6 (range, 0.4-40) years. Portal hypertension was diagnosed in 13 patients (48%) at the median age 5.0 (1.5-27.9) years. Esophageal varices developed in 8 patients (30%) at age 8.0 (2.1-11.9) years; 4 patients (15%) had variceal bleeding, and hypersplenism/splenomegaly occurred in 52%, similarly in both groups. Biliary tract dilatation was detected at 2.8 years in group 1 and at 7.9 years in group 2, significantly more frequently in group 1 (60% vs 18%, P = 0.039), causing cholangitis in 2 (20%) versus none in group 2 (P = 0.055). A total of 10 patients (37%) underwent cadaveric liver transplantation (LT) at a median age of 6.6 (1.0-20.0) years. In 1 patient LT was performed because of hepatoblastoma. Nine of these were combined liver-kidney transplantations (CLKT). Patients in group 1 required LT earlier (4.1 years vs 18.2 years, P = 0.017) and more frequently (70% vs 18%, P = 0.01). Overall survival beyond neonatal period was 85%. Two patients died because of infectious complications after CLKT, and 1 patient because of recurrent hepatoblastoma. CONCLUSIONS: Although correlation of renal and liver manifestations was variable, biliary dilatation was associated with early renal failure. CLKT may be a treatment for patients with ARPKD with marked hepatobiliary complications.
36881088	Efficacy and Safety of Tolvaptan for Patients With Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease in Real-world Practice: A Single Institution Retrospective Study.	BACKGROUND/AIM: We evaluated the efficacy and safety of tolvaptan for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) in real-world practice. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the cases of 27 patients who had been diagnosed with ADPKD between January 2014 and December 2022. Among them, 14 patients received tolvaptan (60 mg/day; morning: 45 mg, night: 15 mg) after being admitted for 2 days. In the outpatient clinic, blood and urine samples were taken monthly. RESULTS: The mean age, pretreatment estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), treatment duration, and total kidney volume were 60 years, 45.6 ml/min/1.73 m2, 2.8 years, and 2,390 ml, respectively. One month later, the patients' renal dysfunction had worsened slightly, and their serum sodium concentrations had significantly increased. After one year, the mean reduction in the eGFR was -5.5 ml/min/1.73 m2 Moreover, at 3 years the patients' renal function was stable. No hepatic dysfunction or electrolyte abnormalities were noted, although discontinuation occurred in two cases. Tolvaptan treatment is considered to be safe. CONCLUSION: Tolvaptan was effective against ADPKD in a real-world setting. Moreover, the safety of tolvaptan was confirmed.

38450843	The effect of primary renal disease upon outcomes after renal transplant.	BACKGROUND: This study investigated whether nature of primary renal disease affects clinical outcomes after renal transplantation at a single center in the United Kingdom. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of 961 renal transplant recipients followed up at a large renal center from 2000 to 2020. Separation of diseases responsible for end-stage kidney disease included glomerulonephritis, diabetic kidney disease, hypertensive nephropathy, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, unknown cause, other causes and chronic pyelonephritis. Outcome data included graft loss, cardiovascular events, malignancy, post-transplant diabetes mellitus and death, analyzed according to primary disease type. RESULTS: The mean age at transplantation was 47.3 years. During a mean follow-up of 7.6 years, 18% of the overall cohort died corresponding to an annualised mortality rate of 2.3%. Death with a functioning graft occurred at a rate of 2.1% per annum, with the highest incidence observed in in patients with diabetic kidney disease (4.1%/year). Post-transplant cardiovascular events occurred in 21% of recipients (2.8% per year), again highest in recipients with diabetic kidney disease (5.1%/year) and hypertensive nephropathy (4.5%/year). Post-transplant diabetes mellitus manifested in 19% of the cohort at an annualized rate of2.1% while cancer incidence stood at 9% with an annualized rate of 1.1% . Graft loss occurred in 6.8% of recipients at the rate of1.2% per year with chronic allograft injury, acute rejection and recurrent glomerulonephritis being the predominant causative factors. Median + IQR dialysis-free survival of the whole cohort was 16.2 (9.9 - > 20) years, being shortest for diabetic kidney disease (11.0 years) and greatest for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (18.2 years) .The collective mean decline in eGFR over time was -1.14ml/min/year. Recipients with Pre-transplant diabetic kidney disease exhibited the fastest rate of decline(-2.1ml/min/year) a statistically significant difference in comparison to the other native kidney diseases with Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease exhibiting the lowest rate of decline(-0.05ml/min/year) CONCLUSION: Primary renal disease can influence the outcome after renal transplantation, with patients with prior diabetic kidney disease having the poorest outcome in terms of dialysis-free survival and loss of transplant function. Autosomal polycystic kidney disease, other cause and unknown cause had the best outcomes compared to other primary renal disease groups.
28465378	Biliary Tract and Liver Complications in Polycystic Kidney Disease.	Polycystic liver disease is a well described manifestation of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Biliary tract complications are less well recognized. We report a 50-year single-center experience of 1007 patients, which raised a hypothesis that ADPKD is associated with biliary tract disease. We tested this hypothesis using all England Hospital Episode Statistics data (1998-2012), within which we identified 23,454 people with ADPKD and 6,412,754 hospital controls. Hospitalization rates for biliary tract disease, serious liver complications, and a range of other known ADPKD manifestations were adjusted for potential confounders. Compared with non-ADPKD hospital controls, those with ADPKD had higher rates of admission for biliary tract disease (rate ratio [RR], 2.24; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 2.16 to 2.33) and serious liver complications (RR, 4.67; 95% CI, 4.35 to 5.02). In analyses restricted to those on maintenance dialysis or with a kidney transplant, RRs attenuated substantially, but ADPKD remained associated with biliary tract disease (RR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.31) and perhaps with serious liver complications (RR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.98 to 1.33). The ADPKD versus non-ADPKD RRs for biliary tract disease were larger for men than women (heterogeneity P<0.001), but RRs for serious liver complications appeared higher in women (heterogeneity P<0.001). Absolute excess risk of biliary tract disease associated with ADPKD was larger than that for serious liver disease, cerebral aneurysms, and inguinal hernias but less than that for urinary tract infections. Overall, biliary tract disease seems to be a distinct and important extrarenal complication of ADPKD.
25534330	Management of pain in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and anatomy of renal innervation.	PURPOSE: Chronic pain is a prominent feature of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease that is difficult to treat and manage, often resulting in a decrease in quality of life. Understanding the underlying anatomy of renal innervation and the various etiologies of pain that occur in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease can help guide proper treatments to manage pain. Reviewing previously studied treatments for pain in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease can help characterize treatment in a stepwise fashion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a literature search of the etiology and management of pain in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and the anatomy of renal innervation using PubMed  and Embase  from January 1985 to April 2014 with limitations to human studies and English language. RESULTS: Pain occurs in the majority of patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease due to renal, hepatic and mechanical origins. Patients may experience different types of pain which can make it difficult to clinically confirm its etiology. An anatomical and histological evaluation of the complex renal innervation helps in understanding the mechanisms that can lead to renal pain. Understanding the complex nature of renal innervation is essential for surgeons to perform renal denervation. The management of pain in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease should be approached in a stepwise fashion. Acute causes of renal pain must first be ruled out due to the high incidence in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. For chronic pain, nonopioid analgesics and conservative interventions can be used first, before opioid analgesics are considered. If pain continues there are surgical interventions such as renal cyst decortication, renal denervation and nephrectomy that can target pain produced by renal or hepatic cysts. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic pain in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is often refractory to conservative, medical and other noninvasive treatments. There are effective surgical procedures that can be performed when more conservative treatments fail. Laparoscopic cyst decortication has been well studied and results in the relief of chronic renal pain in the majority of patients. In addition, renal denervation has been used successfully and could be performed concurrently with cyst decortication. Nephrectomy should be reserved for patients with intractable pain and renal failure when other modalities have failed.

29622386	Long-term outcome of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt for portal hypertension in autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease.	BACKGROUND: Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) with congenital hepatic fibrosis (CHF) causes portal hypertension and its complications. A transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPSS) could serve as a symptomatic treatment for portal hypertension-related symptoms in these children. AIMS: To study the effect of TIPSS on portal hypertension, liver and kidney function and the long term complications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We report on 5 children with CHF treated with a TIPSS to manage severe portal hypertension related symptoms. RESULTS: Mean follow-up time was 7 years and 2 months. At the end of follow-up there was a reduction of spleen size (p = 0.715) and hypersplenism with a rise in platelet count (p = 0.465). Esophageal varices and ascites disappeared in all patients. Liver and kidney function remained stable. In two patients endotipsitis was suspected and two patients developed an in-stent stenosis. There was no sign of encephalopathy in our patients. CONCLUSION: TIPSS using ePTFE-covered stent is a feasible and effective alternative for surgical portosystemic shunting in children with CHF, also on the long term. It can postpone the need of a liver transplantation but close monitoring remains important for early diagnosis of endotipsitis or stent dysfunction related to stenosis.
31722330	Nocturnal Hemodialysis Compared with Conventional Dialysis for End-Stage Renal Disease Treatment in Polycystic Kidney Disease Patients.	BACKGROUND: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common hereditary cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Little is known about outcomes after in-center nocturnal hemodialysis (NHD) treatment in ADPKD patients with ESRD. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of in-center NHD compared with conventional hemodialysis (CHD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) in ADPKD. METHODS: We used data of ADPKD adult patients with ESRD in the hospital database from 2000 to 2016. Propensity score matching, competing-risk regression, and Cox regression models were used for analysis. RESULTS: A total of 170 ADPKD patients were included. The median follow-up time was 5.5 years. In the overall multivariate-adjusted analysis, no significant difference of mortality risk was found in NHD vs. CHD (hazard ratio [HR] 1.33, 95% CI 0.26-6.73, p = 0.31) and PD (HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.14-7.71, p = 0.55), respectively. The overall survival rate also was not significantly different among the 3 groups (p = 0.88). Based on the propensity score, 26 patients on CHD and 26 patients on PD were successfully matched to 13 NHD patients. In the matched analysis, NHD was not associated with a lower risk of mortality compared with CHD (HR 2.14, 95% CI 0.33-14.00, p = 0.31) and PD (HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.52-8.94, p = 0.55). The result was similar when treating renal transplantation as a competing event. However, NHD was associated with a lower rate of complications (38.5 vs. 84.6%, p = 0.003) and a higher level of serum albumin (p < 0.001) compared with PD. CONCLUSIONS: NHD may not be a better choice in survival compared with conventional dialysis modalities for ADPKD patients in this pilot study. Patients in NHD have fewer complications than PD. Future studies with large sample sizes and longer follow-up are required.
26103788	Successful treatment with ustekinumab of psoriasis vulgaris in a patient undergoing hemodialysis.	Psoriasis is a common chronic inflammatory skin disease but psoriasis patients with renal impairment undergoing dialysis are not frequently seen. Furthermore, the published work contains little information on the treatment with biologic drugs of patients with end-stage renal disease. We describe a 57-year-old man with refractory plaque-type psoriasis and end-stage renal disease due to polycystic kidney disease undergoing hemodialysis. He had tried topical medications and ultraviolet therapy for many years and was then treated with ustekinumab (an interleukin-12 and interleukin-23 blocker), which resulted in good clinical response along with stable renal function. After a few years of therapy, no side-effects have been observed. Our experience with this patient expands the spectrum of ustekinumab to include psoriasis patients with renal failure undergoing hemodialysis. 
33910506	Demographic, diagnostic and therapeutic characteristics of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease in Ghana.	BACKGROUND: Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) is the commonest of the hereditary kidney diseases and mostly ensues in utero with signs delayed until after several decades. This study assessed the demographic, diagnostic (clinical and biochemical features) and therapeutic patterns among ADPKD patients who attended the nephrology unit of Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH) from 2007 to 2018. METHODS: This cross-sectional retrospective analysis of ADPKD patient records was conducted at the nephrology unit of KATH in October 2020. The records of 82 ADPKD was used for this study. Demographic, clinical, biochemical, ultrasonographic and therapeutic data was obtained, organized and analyzed with Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). RESULTS: ADPKD was most prevalent in people within the ages of 31-40 years (25.6 %), with a male (52.4 %) preponderance. The most common clinical features presented were flank pain (30.5 %) and bipedal swelling (18.3 %). Hypertension (42.7 %), urinary tract infections (UTIs) (19.5 %), and anemia (13.4 %) were the most common complications reported. Average level of HDL-c was higher in females (1.7) than in males (1.2) (p = 0.001). Hematuria (34 %) and proteinuria (66 %) were among the biochemical derangements presented. About 81.7 % had CKD at diagnosis with the majority in stages 1 (27.0 %), 3(23.2 %) and 5 (20.3 %). Poor corticomedullary differentiation was observed in 90.2 % of participants and increased echogenicity was observed in 89.0 % of the participants. Estimated GFR (eGFR) correlated positively with echotexture (r = 0.320, p = 0.005) and negatively with CMD (r= -0.303, p = 0.008). About 95.1 % of patients were on conservative therapy including: 73.2 %, 52.4 %, 22.0 %, 13.4 %, 8.5 % on Irebesartan/Lisinopril, Nifecard XL, Hydralazine, Methyldopa and Bisoprolol respectively for hypertension; 26.8 and 3.7 % on Gliclazide and Metformin respectively for Type 2 diabetes mellitus; 25.6 %, 24.4 and 18.3 % on CaCO3, fersolate and folic acid respectively as nutrient supplements with 4.9 % of participants on renal replacement therapy (RRT). CONCLUSIONS: ADPKD occurs in people aged >= 31 years with a higher male preponderance. Clinical features include flank and abdominal pain, bipedal swelling, headache, amongst others. Uremia, hematuria, proteinuria, decreased eGFR, were the common biochemical derangements reported with higher severity detected in men. The therapeutic interventions mostly involved conservative therapy to manage symptoms and other comorbid conditions and rarely renal replacement therapy (RRT).
26718167	KHA-CARI Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease Guideline: Management of Intracranial Aneurysms.	
26450465	Long-Term Follow-Up of Kidney Transplant Recipients With Polycystic Kidney Disease.	OBJECTIVES: Patients with polycystic kidney disease are candidates for kidney transplant. We report the results of our single center study of 250 first transplant recipients with polycystic kidney disease (autosomal dominant [64%], medullary cystic [16%], autosomal recessive [6%], and nonspecified [14%]). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patient groups were divided and analyzed according to the origin of the graft (deceased donor or living donor). We also analyzed demographic data of donors and recipients, waiting time, duration of dialysis, transfusion, nephrectomy, hospitalization, morbidities, and graft and patient survival. The study was approved by the Ethical Review Committee of the Institute. All of the protocols conformed to the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Helsinki Declaration. RESULTS: The deceased-donor group comprised 79% and the living-donor group comprised 21% of the cases. Nephrectomy was performed on 21% of the recipients. The deceased-donor group showed significantly higher values than the living-donor group regarding rate of hemodialysis (82% vs 68%), duration of dialysis (1571 vs 1002 days), waiting time (1129 vs 33 days), and blood transfusions (45% vs 27%). In deceased-donor versus living-donor transplant recipients, surgical complications included arterial stenosis (1% vs 0%), venous thrombosis (1% vs 0%), urine leakage (0.5% vs 1.9%), ureteral stenosis (0.5% vs 0%), reflux (0% vs 1.9%), lymphocele (11.7% vs 8.1%), and hernia (5.2% vs 8.1%), with no statistically significant differences shown between the groups. The living-donor group had graft and patient survival rates as high as the deceased-donor group. CONCLUSIONS: The low rate of morbidity and excellent survival rates make kidney transplant an excellent option for patients with polycystic kidney disease. Although fear of future appearance of polycystic kidney disease may reduce the rate of related living donors, our study showed that graft and patient survival rates in the living-donor group were as high as in the deceased-donor group.
27184299	The Risk for New-Onset Diabetes Mellitus after Kidney Transplantation in Patients with Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.	OBJECTIVES: New-onset diabetes after kidney transplantation (NODAT) is associated with both renal allograft failure and increased rates of mortality. The objective of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the risk for NODAT in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). METHODS: A literature search was performed using MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from inception through July 2015. Studies that reported relative risks, odd ratios or hazard ratios comparing the risk for NODAT in patients with ADPKD were included. Pooled risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a random-effect, generic inverse variance method. RESULTS: Included in the analysis were 12 cohort studies, which comprised 1379 patients with ADPKD of a total of 9849 patients who had undergone kidney transplants. The pooled RRs of NODAT in patients with ADPKD were 1.92 (95% CI, 1.36 to 2.70). When meta-analysis was limited only to studies with confounder-adjusted analysis, the pooled RRs for NODAT were 1.98 (95% CI, 1.33 to 2.94). However, the association between NODAT requiring insulin treatment was insignificant, with pooled RRs of 1.57 (95% CI, 0.75 to 3.27). CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis demonstrates a significant association between ADPKD and NODAT in recipients of kidney transplants. The findings of this study may impact clinical management and follow up for patients with ADPKD after kidney transplantation.
30897191	Refractory ascites and graft dysfunction in early renal transplantation.	The occurrence of ascites after Renal Transplant (RT) is infrequent, and may be a consequence of surgical or medical complications. Case report: 61 year-old, male, history of arterial hypertension, tongue carcinoma and alcoholic habits 12-20g/day. He had chronic kidney disease secondary to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, without hepatic polycystic disease. He underwent cadaver donor RT in September 2017. He had delayed graft function by surgically corrected renal artery stenosis. He was admitted in January 2018 for ascites de novo, with no response to diuretics. HE had visible abdominal collateral circulation. Graft dysfunction, adequate tacrolinemia, Innocent urinary sediment, mild anemia, without thrombocytopenia. Serum albumin 4.0g / dL. Normal hepatic biochemistry. Peritoneal fluid with transudate characteristics and serum albumin gradient > 1.1. Ultrasound showed hepatomegaly, permeable vascular axes, without splenomegaly. Mycophenolate mofetil was suspended, with reduced remaining immunosuppression. He maintained refractory ascites: excluded infectious, metabolic, autoimmune and neoplastic etiologies. No nephrotic proteinuria and no heart failure. MRI: micronodules compatible with bile cysts. Upper Digestive Tract Endoscopy did not show gastroesophageal varicose veins. Normal abdominal lymphoscintigraphy. He underwent exploratory laparoscopy with liver biopsy: incomplete septal cirrhosis of probable vascular etiology some dilated bile ducts. He maintained progressive RT dysfunction and restarted hemodialysis. The proposed direct measurement of portal pressure was delayed by ascites resolution. There was further recovery of the graft function. Discussion: Incomplete septal cirrhosis is an uncommon cause of non-cirrhotic portal hypertension. Its definition is not well known, morphological and pathophysiological. We have not found published cases of post-RT ascites secondary to this pathology, described as possibly associated with drugs, immune alterations, infections, hypercoagulability and genetic predisposition.
29322327	Combined and sequential liver-kidney transplantation in children.	Combined and sequential liver-kidney transplantation (CLKT and SLKT) is a definitive treatment in children with end-stage organ failure. There are two major indications: - terminal insufficiency of both organs, or - need for transplanting new liver as a source of lacking enzyme or specific regulator of the immune system in a patient with renal failure. A third (uncommon) option is secondary end-stage renal failure in liver transplant recipients. These three clinical settings use distinct qualification algorithms. The most common indications include primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) and autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD), followed by liver diseases associated with occasional kidney failure. Availability of anti-C5a antibody (eculizumab) has limited the validity of CLKT in genetic atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS). The liver coming from the same donor as renal graft (in CLKT) is immunologically protective for the kidney and this provides long-term rejection-free follow-up. No such protection is observed in SLKT, when both organs come from different donors, except uncommon cases of living donation of both organs. Overall long-term outcome in CLKT in terms of graft survival is good and not different from isolated liver or kidney transplantation, however patient survival is inferior due to complexity of this procedure.
27861383	Living donor renal transplantation in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome: A case report.	INTRODUCTION: Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), autoantibodies directed against phospholipid-binding proteins are associated with cause vascular thrombosis. Patients with APS requiring renal transplantation are at risk of early graft loss due to arterial or venous thrombosis, or thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). Here, we report 3 cases of successful renal transplantation in patients with APS. CLINICAL FINDINGS: A 53-year-old man with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) had experienced bilateral deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in the lower extremities 16 years ago and was administered warfarin. However, he frequently experienced recurrent DVT despite of anticoagulation therapy. Before the surgery, APS was confirmed based on positive results lupus anticoagulant in serological tests. A 40-year-old man with polycystic kidney disease and a history recurrent DVT tested positive for lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies. Lastly, a 42-year-old woman with ESRD was diagnosed with APS 7 years ago. She also developed DVT and tested positive for lupus anticoagulant and anti-B2-glycoprotein 1. THE ANTICOAGULATION PROTOCOL WAS AS FOLLOWS IN ALL CASES: Warfarin was stopped 5 days before living donor renal transplantation and intravenous heparin therapy was started. During surgery, bolus heparin injections (3000 U) were administered to prevent arterial or venous thrombosis. Heparin was substituted with warfarin on postoperative day 4. The third patient (42/F) developed clinical rejection indicated by increased serum creatinine levels and donor-specific antibodies (DSA) and received steroid pulse therapy, plasmapheresis, and rituximab. This treatment restored graft function to within the normal range. The latest graft function in all patients was maintained at normal levels in the outpatient clinic. CONCLUSIONS: Living donor renal transplantation may be successful in patients with APS following perioperative anticoagulation therapy. However, because of the high risk of TMA or vascular thrombosis in the early postoperative period, close monitoring for hypercoagulability and continuous anticoagulation is essential for maintaining graft function.
35634907	Pancreatic extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy for a patient concurrent with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease: a case report.	Whether pancreatic extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) is safe for patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is unclear. A woman in her early 30s was admitted to our hospital because of intermittent upper abdominal pain and recurrent pancreatitis. The imaging results confirmed the diagnosis of pancreatic stones and ADPKD. We performed pancreatic ESWL using a third-generation lithotripter to pulverize the pancreatic stones. A maximum of 5000 shock waves was delivered per therapeutic session. A second session of ESWL was performed the next day. The patient developed no adverse events or complications related to pancreatic ESWL. Three years after treatment, the patient had developed no relapse of pancreatitis or abdominal pain. Shock waves do not lead to complications such as hematuria, cyst rupture, or deterioration of the inner bleeding of renal cysts. Multiple kidney cysts are not a contraindication for pancreatic ESWL.
35909011	Simultaneous Robotic-Assisted Bilateral Native Nephrectomy and Kidney Transplantation for Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease in Recipients With High Body Mass Index: Report of 2 Cases.	Robotic kidney transplantation is a safe, reproducible, and less morbid technique in high body mass index and end-stage renal disease. Polycystic kidney disease is a relative contraindication to robotic-assisted kidney transplantation because of the mass effect of the native kidneys on the patient's pelvis that prevents ideal exposure. We report the first 2 cases of robotic-assisted simultaneous bilateral nephrectomy and kidney transplantation for patients with obesity and adult polycystic kidney disease. The recipients were 2 males, 50 and 53 years old, with a body mass index of 35.1 41.6 kg/m2 and 41.6 kg/m2, respectively. Both recipients had suitable living donors. The average operating time was 395 minutes and the estimated blood loss was on average 250 mL. The postoperative course was uneventful and the patients were discharged home on days 4 and 5. Performing robotic nephrectomies simultaneously with kidney transplantation can be done safely, allowing patients with obesity and polycystic kidney disease needing bilateral nephrectomy, to take full advantage of minimally invasive kidney transplantation.
28438856	Tailoring the 'Perfect Fit' for Renal Transplant Recipients with End-stage Polycystic Kidney Disease: Indications and Timing of Native Nephrectomy.	"BACKGROUND: The ideal timing of native nephrectomy in relation to kidney transplantation in patients with autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) can be a very puzzling decision for transplant surgeons and remains a matter of debate. This review article aims to present current literature regarding this highly controversial issue. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The MEDLINE/PubMed database was searched using ""polycystic kidney disease"", ""renal/kidney transplantation"" and ""native nephrectomy"" as key words. Our search was focused on the optimal timing of and indications for native nephrectomy in renal transplant recipients with ADPKD. RESULTS: In symptomatic cases, pre-transplant unilateral or bilateral native nephrectomy seems appropriate, in order to alleviate symptoms. In cases that are provided with the option of living-donor transplantation, the performance of the simultaneous procedure could be of benefit. When the principal indication of native nephrectomy is the creation of space for the renal allograft, various studies highlight the safety of the simultaneous approach of either unilateral or bilateral nephrectomy. CONCLUSION: No consensus exists on the appropriate timing for native nephrectomy in patients with ADPKD. Several issues to be addressed in the decision-making process are the importance of residual diuresis, the longer operative time along with the associated prolonged ischemia time and higher complication rate of the combined procedure."
29787614	Outcome of polycystic kidney disease patients on peritoneal dialysis: Systematic review of literature and meta-analysis.	"BACKGROUND: Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is the most frequent hereditary cause of chronic kidney disease. Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is often avoided for patients with PKD because of the suspected risk of mechanical and infectious complications. Only a few studies have analyzed the outcome of PKD patients on PD with sometimes conflicting results. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to investigate outcomes of patients with PKD treated by PD. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed examining all studies which included ""Polycystic kidney disease"" and ""Peritoneal dialysis"" in their titles, excluding commentaries, letters to the authors and abstracts. PubMed, Embase, Google scholar and Scopus were searched to December 31st 2017. The primary outcome was overall patient survival. Additional outcomes were PD technique survival, incidence of peritonitis and incidence of abdominal wall hernia. RESULTS: 9 studies published between 1998 and 2016 were included for analysis with a total of 7,197 patients including 882 PKD patients. Overall survival of PKD patients was found to be better compared to non-PKD patients (HR = 0.70 [95% CI, 0.54-0.92]). There were no statistical differences between PKD and non-PKD patients in terms of peritonitis (OR = 0.86 [95% CI, 0.66-1.12]) and technical survival (HR = 0.98 [95% CI, 0.83-1.16]). There was an increased risk of hernia in PKD patients (OR = 2.28 [95% CI, 1.26-4.12]). CONCLUSIONS: PKD is associated with a better global survival, an increased risk of abdominal hernia, but no differences in peritonitis rate or technical survival were found. PD is a safe dialysis modality for PKD patients. Properly designed controlled studies are needed to determine whether all PKD patients are eligible for PD or whether some specific criteria should be determined."
26714390	Hypotension in Infants on Chronic Peritoneal Dialysis: Mechanisms, Complications, and Management.	Hypotension represents a very serious clinical problem in patients receiving renal replacement therapy, and it is associated with a significant increase in mortality risk. Infants on chronic peritoneal dialysis (CPD) can be particularly prone to chronic hypotension because of the hyponatremic hypovolemia risk related to their primary renal disease, their nutritional needs, and their peritoneal membrane characteristics. In this setting, if an acute clinical event leads to a further decline in systolic blood pressure, the counteract and perfusion pressure autoregulatory mechanisms can both be impaired, leading to severe complications. Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION) represents an acute ischemic disorder of the optic nerve head and a dramatic cause of sudden blindness, whose incidence is about 1% in children on CPD. In recent studies, very young age, autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease, and sustained hypotension were found to be substantial risk factors for AON. In infants at risk, strategies of long-term treatment and prevention of peritoneal dialysis-induced hypotension should be applied to prevent progression in the pathophysiologic cascade that leads to chronic hypotension and its complications.
25813872	Outcome of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus on chronic dialysis: an observational study of incident patients of the French National Registry 2002-2012.	OBJECTIVES: The objective of this article is to describe the outcome (mortality, kidney transplantation) of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) on chronic dialysis. METHODS: The overall and cardiovascular (CV) mortality and access to kidney transplantation were studied in all SLE patients incident on chronic dialysis in France between 2002 and 2012 (REIN registry). They were compared to age- and sex-matched patients with diabetic nephropathy and with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (PKD) on chronic dialysis. RESULTS: A total of 368 SLE patients were included in the national REIN registry between 2002 and 2012. Cumulative incidence of death was 16.9% at five years, with no difference between haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Independent risk factors of death were age, past history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic respiratory insufficiency. At five years, CV and all-cause mortality in SLE patients were lower than in matched diabetic patients, but three-fold higher than in matched PKD patients. Access to the kidney transplant waiting list and to kidney transplantation was higher in SLE patients than in matched diabetic patients, but lower than in matched PKD patients. CONCLUSIONS: SLE patients on chronic dialysis are a population at high risk of death influenced by CV burden and chronic respiratory failure, but not by the method of dialysis. Their outcome, in terms of mortality and access to kidney transplantation, is intermediate between diabetic patients and patients with PKD.
27956812	Pediatric living donor liver transplantation for congenital hepatic fibrosis using a mother's graft with von Meyenburg complex: A case report.	This is the first report of living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) for congenital hepatic fibrosis (CHF) using a mother's graft with von Meyenburg complex. A 6-year-old girl with CHF, who suffered from recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding, was referred to our hospital for liver transplantation. Her 38-year-old mother was investigated as a living donor and multiple biliary hamartoma were seen on her computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scan. The mother's liver function tests were normal and she did not have any organ abnormality, including polycystic kidney disease. LDLT using the left lateral segment (LLS) graft from the donor was performed. The donor LLS graft weighed 250 g; the graft recipient weight ratio was 1.19%. The operation and post-operative course of the donor were uneventful and she was discharged on post-operative day (POD) 8. The graft liver function was good, and the recipient was discharged on POD 31. LDLT using a graft with von Meyenburg complex is safe and useful. Long-term follow-up is needed with respect to graft liver function and screening malignant tumors.
31829256	Management of delivery of a fetus with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease: a case report of abdominal dystocia and review of the literature.	BACKGROUND: Autosomal recessive renal polycystic kidney disease occurs in 1 in 20,000 live births. It is caused by mutations in both alleles of the PKHD1 gene. Management of delivery in cases of suspected autosomal recessive renal polycystic kidney disease is rarely discussed, and literature concerning abdominal dystocia is extremely scarce. We present a case of a patient with autosomal recessive renal polycystic kidney disease whose delivery was complicated by abdominal dystocia, and we discuss the factors that determined the route and timing of delivery. CASE PRESENTATION: A 23-year-old Caucasian woman, G2 P0, with a prior unremarkable pregnancy was referred to our tertiary center at 31 weeks of gestation because of severe oligoamnios (amniotic fluid index = 2) and hyperechogenic, dedifferentiated, and enlarged fetal kidneys. She had no other genitourinary anomaly. Fetal magnetic resonance imaging showed enlarged, hypersignal kidneys and severe pulmonary hypoplasia. We had a high suspicion of autosomal recessive renal polycystic kidney disease, and after discussion with our multidisciplinary team, the parents opted for conservative care. Ultrasound performed at 35 weeks of gestation showed a fetal estimated weight of 3550 g and an abdominal circumference of 377 mm, both above the 90th percentile. Because of the very rapid kidney growth and suspected risk of abdominal dystocia, we proposed induction of labor at 36 weeks of gestation after corticosteroid administration for fetal lung maturation. Vaginal delivery was complicated by abdominal dystocia, which resolved by continuing expulsive efforts and gentle fetal traction. A 3300-g (P50-90) male infant was born with Apgar scores of 1-7-7 at 1, 5, and 10 minutes, respectively, and arterial and venous umbilical cord pH values of 7.23-7.33. Continuous peritoneal dialysis was started at day 2 of life because of anuria. Currently, the infant is 1 year old and is waiting for kidney transplant that should be performed once he reaches 10 kg. Molecular analysis of PKHD1 performed on deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from the umbilical cord confirmed autosomal recessive renal polycystic kidney disease. CONCLUSIONS: Management of delivery in cases of suspected autosomal recessive renal polycystic kidney disease needs to be discussed because of the risk of abdominal dystocia. The route and timing of delivery depend on the size of the fetal abdominal circumference and the gestational age. The rate of kidney growth must also be taken into account.
38279830	Fetal hyperechoic kidneys: Diagnostic considerations and genetic testing strategies.	Isolated bilateral hyperechoic kidneys (HEK) on prenatal ultrasound presents diagnostic, prognostic, and counseling challenges. Prognosis ranges from normal outcome to lethal postnatally. Presence/absence of extra-renal malformations, gestational age at presentation, amniotic fluid volume, and renal size may distinguish underlying etiologies and thereby prognosis, as prognosis is highly dependent upon underlying etiology. An underlying genetic diagnosis, clearly impactful, is determined in only 55%-60% of cases. We conducted a literature review of chromosomal (aneuploidies, copy number variants [CNVs]) single genes and other etiologies of fetal bilateral HEK, summarized how this information informs prognosis and recurrence risk, and critically assessed laboratory testing strategies. The most commonly identified etiologies are autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and microdeletions at 17q12 involving HNF1b. With rapid gene discovery, alongside advances in prenatal imaging and fetal phenotyping, the growing list of single gene diagnoses includes ciliopathies, overgrowth syndromes, and renal tubular dysgenesis. At present, microarray and gene panels or whole exome sequencing (WES) are first line tests employed for diagnostic evaluation. Whole genome sequencing (WGS), with the ability to detect both single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and CNVs, would be expected to provide the highest diagnostic yield.
38378339	Autologous Blood Transfusion During Elective Surgery in a Candidate for Living Donor Transplantation: A Case Report.	BACKGROUND: Blood transfusions are risk factors for alloimmunization and unfavorable outcomes in solid organ transplant recipients. PURPOSE: We propose the adoption of autologous blood transfusion (ABT) in transplant candidates and recipients referred to elective surgery. METHODS: We present a case of a 45-year-old man with chronic kidney disease stage 5 due to polycystic kidney disease, who was qualified for a native kidney nephrectomy (NKN) before kidney transplantation. Before the scheduled surgery, the patient was referred to a blood donation center for blood collection. RESULTS: During 2 consecutive visits, autologous blood was collected uneventfully, and this allowed for the preparation of 2 units of red blood cell concentrates and a unit of plasma. Pre- and post-donation hemoglobin values were 11.9 and 10.4 g/dL, respectively. The NKN procedure was complicated by intra-abdominal bleeding from an accessory aberrant artery of the kidney. Hemoglobin dropped to 6.8 g/dL and was treated with ABT, followed by artery embolization. This allowed for an increase of hemoglobin to 8.3 mg/dL and avoidance of allotransfusion. Six weeks after NKN, the patient underwent successful kidney transplantation from a living donor. Panel reactive antibodies before transplantation were 0%, and graft function has been excellent during 20 months of observation. CONCLUSION: An autologous blood collection is a feasible option for patients with chronic kidney disease. ABT should be considered the procedure of choice when qualifying potential waiting list candidates and solid organ recipients for elective surgeries.
28201848	New Advances in Polycystic Liver Diseases.	Polycystic liver diseases (PLDs) include a heterogeneous group of congenital disorders inherited as dominant or recessive genetic traits; they are manifested alone or in association with polycystic kidney disease. Ductal plate malformation during embryogenesis and the loss of heterozygosity linked to second-hit mutations may promote the dilatation and/or development of a large number (> 20) of biliary cysts, which are the main cause of morbidity in these patients. Surgical procedures aimed to eliminate symptomatic cysts show short-term beneficial effects, but are not able to block the disease progression. Therefore, liver transplantation is the only curative option. Intense studies on the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of PLDs have resulted in different clinical trials, some of them with promising outcomes. Here the authors summarize the key aspects of PLD etiology, pathogenesis, and therapy, highlighting the most recent advances and future research directions.
28645206	Catheter-based renal denervation as therapy for chronic severe kidney-related pain.	Background: Loin pain haematuria syndrome (LPHS) and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) are the most important non-urological conditions to cause chronic severe kidney-related pain. Multidisciplinary programmes and surgical methods have shown inconsistent results with respect to pain reduction. Percutaneous catheter-based renal denervation (RDN) could be a less invasive treatment option for these patients. Methods: Our aim was to explore the change in perceived pain and use of analgesic medication from baseline to 3, 6 and 12 months after RDN. Patients with LPHS or ADPKD, who experienced kidney-related pain >=3 months with a visual analogue scale (VAS) score >= 50/100 could be included. Percutaneous RDN was performed with a single-electrode radiofrequency ablation catheter. Results: RDN was performed in 11 patients (6 with LPHS and 5 with ADPKD). Perceived pain declined in the whole group by 23 mm (P = 0.012 for the total group). In patients with LPHS and ADPKD, the median daily defined dosage of analgesic medication decreased from 1.6 [interquartile range (IQR) 0.7-2.3] and 1.4 (IQR 0.0-7.4) at baseline to 0.3 (IQR 0.0-1.9; P = 0.138) and 0.0 (IQR 0.0-0.8; P = 0.285) at 12 months, respectively. Mean estimated glomerular filtration rate decreased in the whole group by 5.4 mL/min/1.73 m2 at 6 months compared with baseline (P = 0.163). Conclusions: These results suggest that percutaneous catheter-based RDN reduces pain complaints and the use of analgesic medication in patients with LPHS or ADPKD. The present results can serve as the rationale for a larger, preferably randomized (sham) controlled study.
30526503	Early onset of graft glomerulopathy in a patient with post-transplant diabetes mellitus after renal transplantation: a case report.	BACKGROUND: Post-transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) is an emerging problem in kidney transplantation, representing an important risk factor for kidney function loss. Diabetic nephropathy (DN) occurrence in transplanted kidneys is poorly investigated. Current knowledge describes DN recurrence in graft 5.9 years from kidney transplantation however there is little data about PTDM and DN. Here, we report a clinical case peculiar for an early appearance of advanced glomerular diabetic lesions, after kidney transplantation. CASE PRESENTATION: A 45-year-old Caucasian male affected by autosomal polycystic kidney disease was transplanted with a cadaveric-kidney-donor from 58-year-old male. Induction immunosuppressive therapy included basiliximab and steroids while the maintenance treatment included, tacrolimus, mofetil micophenolate and methylprednisolone. One month after transplantation the patient developed diabetes requiring treatment with repaglinide quickly replaced with insulin to obtain an acceptable glycemic control (HbA1c 52 mmol/mol). Glycosuria was detected persistently during the first six months after transplantation. To achieve further improvement in glycemic control, a shift from tacrolimus to cyclosporine (CyA) was made and steroids were rapidly tapered and stopped. To minimize calcineurin inhibitors toxicity, which was revealed in the 1-year-protocol-biopsy, everolimus was introduced thereby lowering CyA through levels. Moderate hypertension was well controlled with doxazosin. Thirty months after transplantation a second graft biopsy was performed owing to renal function decline and microalbuminuria appearance. Histological analysis surprisingly showed mesangiolysis and microaneurysms; glomerular sclero-hyalinosis and basal membrane thickness and typical nodular glomerulosclerosis. C4d staining was negative and no evidence of immune deposits were detected. Donor Specific Antibodies, serum C3 and C4 levels and autoimmunity tests were negative. Retrospective analysis on donor history didn't show diabetes or insulin resistance and no diabetic lesions were found in kidney pre-implant biopsy. CONCLUSIONS: In our knowledge, this is the first report describing a very early onset of advanced diabetic glomerular lesions in a graft biopsy after PTDM. We hypothesize that additional factors such as everolimus and hypertension, may have contribute to kidney damage.
31019972	Pretransplant Nephrectomy for Large Polycystic Kidneys in ADPKD (Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease) Patients: Is Peritoneal Dialysis Recovery Possible after Surgery?	The choice of modality for renal replacement therapy in patients with ADPKD varies, often based on patient choice, physician-related factors, and resource availability. For a long time peritoneal dialysis (PD) was considered as relative contraindication due to the possible limited intraperitoneal space. In recent years, some studies suggested it is a valid option also in patients with ADPKD to be considered as a first line treatment in potentially fit patients. Diuresis volume lowering and potential permanent damage of peritoneal integrity, both leading to a necessary switch to haemodialysis, are the two most important dangers after nephrectomy, especially if bilateral, in PD patients. We performed a retrospective analysis of patient underwent native polycystic kidney nephrectomy in order to state the possibility to recover peritoneal dialysis after surgery.
30589879	Change in kidney volume after kidney transplantation in patients with autosomal polycystic kidney disease.	BACKGROUND: The indication to bilateral nephrectomy in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney scheduled for kidney transplantation is controversial. Indeed, the progressive enlargement of cysts may increase the risk of complications and the need for nephrectomy. However, very few studies investigated the change in kidney volume after kidney transplantation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, the change in native kidney volume in polycystic patients was evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging. Forty patients were included in the study. Kidney diameters and total kidney volume were evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging in patients who underwent simultaneous nephrectomy and kidney transplantation and in patients with kidney transplant alone, before transplantation and 1 year after transplantation. RESULTS: There was a significant reduction of kidney volume after transplantation, with a mean degree of kidney diameters reduction varying from 12.24% to 14.43%. Mean total kidney volume of the 55 kidney considered in the analysis significantly reduced from 1617.94 +- 833.42 ml to 1381.42 +- 1005.73 ml (P<0.05), with a mean rate of 16.44% of volume decrease. More than 80% of patients had a volume reduction in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Polycystic kidneys volume significantly reduces after kidney transplantation, and this would reduce the need for prophylactic bilateral nephrectomy in asymptomatic patients.
27376719	Fluoroscopy versus ultrasonography guided mini-percutaneous nephrolithotomy in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.	The objective of the study was to compare the therapeutic outcomes between the ultrasonography-guided (USG) and the fluoroscopy-guided (FG) mini-percutaneous nephrolithotomy (MPCNL) for the treatment of large or complex upper urinary tract stones (S.T.O.N.E. scores 5-11) in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). 45 ADPKD patients who were suffering from large or complex upper urinary tract stones (S.T.O.N.E. scores 5-11, mean score 7.6) in 45 renal units were accrued into this retrospective study. They were treated by either USG (20 patients) or FG (25 patients) MPCNL in our center. The treatment results as well as the complications according to the modified Clavien system were assessed and compared. The FG MPCNL group had a higher success rate in accessing the targeted calyces than the USG MPCNL group (96 vs. 70 %, p = 0.048). There was no significant difference observed between the two groups with respect to the operative time, the mean hemoglobin drop, and the stone free rate. The overall operative complications and the perioperative blood transfusion rates were significantly higher in the USG than the FG MPCNL groups, 71.4 vs. 29.2 %, p = 0.011, and 35.7 vs. 4.2 %, p = 0.018, respectively. There was no significant difference between these two groups in terms of major complications (Clavien score 3a-4a) (p = 0.542). In our center, the FG MPCNL was a superior modality to the USG MPCNL in the treatment of large or complex kidney stones in the ADPKD patients. It resulted in higher successful calyceal punctures and less operative complications.

29208861	Etiology of Early Renal Allograft Dysfunction and Comparison between Dysfunction and Function Group: A Single Center Study.	Over a period of two years thirty five renal allograft recipients & donors were evaluated to find out the aetiology of early renal allograft dysfunction, in the Department of Nephrology, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, Dhaka, Bangladesh from March 2010 to February 2012. A comparison was made between dysfunction & functioning graft group. Mean age of recipients were (36.4+-9.4) years, mean age of donors were (41.7+-8.3) years, with a male and female ratio of 3:1. Fifty percent recipients showed one heliotype match, ninety percent recipients were anti CMV antibody IgG positive, few were anti CMV antibody IgM positive. All kidney transplant recipients received same immunosuppressive drugs. Primary disease of the renal allograft recipients demonstrates that majority 88.58% had glomerulonephritis, 5.72% had polycystic kidney disease, 2.85% had chronic pyelonephritis and another 2.85% had diabetic nephropathy. Among 35 renal allograft recipients 23(66%) showed early graft dysfunction, 12(34%) showed normal graft function. The etiology of early graft dysfunction showed, 50% developed acute rejection, 17% acute cyclosporine toxicity, 17% acute tubular necrosis, 8% had graft thrombosis and 8% developed recurrent glomerulonephritis. Sub-clinical rejection was detected in 20% cases. Comparison of donor characteristics between dysfunctioning and functioning graft groups revealed that age and sex were identically distributed between the groups (p=0.183 and p=0.087 respectively). The mean serum creatinine of donor was significantly higher in the graft dysfunction group than that in the functioning graft group (113.5+-12.6 vs. 99.6+-17.3; p=0.025), as well as the mean creatinine clearance rate was significantly less in the former group than that in the later group (82.1+-13.5 vs. 93.9+-18.6, p=0.040). The mean cyclosporine (C2) level on 7th POD were 1593.2+-320.4ng/ml in graft dysfunction group and 1439.1+-199.5ng/ml in the functioning graft group which decreased to 1364.8+-263.7ng/ml and 1114.2+-145.1ng/ml after three months in the dysfunction and the functioning graft groups respectively. There was no significant difference in the cyclosporine level between groups on 7th POD and 14th POD, 1st and 2nd month. However, at 3rd month the level of cyclosporine was higher in the dysfunction group than that in the function group. Proteinuria on 14th POD was almost similar between dysfunction and function graft groups (p=0.704). However, higher incidence of proteinuria was observed in subsequent months in the graft dysfunction group compared to the function graft group. All the postoperative variables like systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, fever and tremor were higher in dysfunction group in comparison to functioning graft group. Per operative biopsy of donor kidney, some showed increased number of sclerotic glomeruli which is more common in dysfunction group. Among 35 recipients 2(16.7%) died due to infection in dysfunction group compared to 1(4.3%) in functioning graft group.
24827775	Analysis of data from the ERA-EDTA Registry indicates that conventional treatments for chronic kidney disease do not reduce the need for renal replacement therapy in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.	Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a major cause of end-stage kidney failure, but is often identified early and therefore amenable to timely treatment. Interventions known to postpone the need for renal replacement therapy (RRT) in non-ADPKD patients have also been tested in ADPKD patients, but with inconclusive results. To help resolve this we determined changes in RRT incidence rates as an indicator for increasing effective renoprotection over time in ADPKD. We analyzed data from the European Renal Association-European Dialyses and Transplant Association Registry on 315,444 patients starting RRT in 12 European countries between 1991 and 2010, grouped into four 5-year periods. Of them, 20,596 were due to ADPKD. Between the first and last period the mean age at onset of RRT increased from 56.6 to 58.0 years. The age- and gender-adjusted incidence rate of RRT for ADPKD increased slightly over the four periods from 7.6 to 8.3 per million population. No change over time was found in the incidence of RRT for ADPKD up to age 50, whereas in recent time periods the incidence in patients above the age of 70 clearly increased. Among countries there was a significant positive association between RRT take-on rates for non-ADPKD kidney disease and ADPKD. Thus, the increased age at onset of RRT is most likely due to an increased access for elderly ADPKD patients or lower competing risk prior to the start of RRT rather than the consequence of effective emerging renoprotective treatments for ADPKD. 
37100223	How to manage renal masses in kidney transplant recipients? A collaborative review by the EAU-YAU kidney transplantation and renal cancer working groups.	INTRODUCTION: Kidney transplant (KT) recipients have a four-times higher risk of renal malignancies compared to general population. As these patients frequently harbor bilateral or multifocal tumors, the management of renal masses is still under debate. OBJECTIVE: To explore the current management of the native kidney masses in KT patients. ACQUISITION OF EVIDENCE: We performed a literature search on MEDLINE/PubMed database. A number of 34 studies were included in the present review. SYNTHESIS OF EVIDENCE: In frail patients with renal masses below 3 cm, active surveillance is a feasible alternative. Nephron-sparing surgery is not justified for masses in the native kidney. Radical nephrectomy is the standard treatment for post-transplant renal tumors of the native kidneys in KT recipients, with laparoscopic techniques leading to significantly less perioperative complication rates as compared to the open approach. Concurrent bilateral native nephrectomy at the time of transplantation can be considered in patients with renal mass and polycystic kidney disease, especially if no residual urinary output is present. Patients with localized disease and successful radical nephrectomy do not require immunosuppression adjustment. In metastatic cases, mTOR agents can ensure efficient antitumoral response, while maintaining proper immunosuppression in order to protect the graft. CONCLUSIONS: Post-transplant renal cancer of the native kidneys is a frequent occurrence. Radical nephrectomy is most frequently performed for localized renal masses. A standardized and widely-approved screening strategy for malignancies of native renal units is yet to be implemented.
26545860	Bronchiectasis diagnosed after renal transplantation: a retrospective multicenter study.	BACKGROUND: Bronchiectasis is characterized by abnormal, permanent and irreversible dilatation of the bronchi, usually responsible for daily symptoms and frequent respiratory complications. Many causes have been identified, but only limited data are available concerning the association between bronchiectasis and renal transplantation. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective multicenter study of cases of bronchiectasis diagnosed after renal transplantation in 14 renal transplantation departments (French SPIESSER group). Demographic, clinical, laboratory and CT scan data were collected. RESULTS: Forty-six patients were included (mean age 58.2 years, 52.2 % men). Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (32.6 %) was the main underlying renal disease. Chronic cough and sputum (50.0 %) were the major symptoms leading to chest CT scan. Mean duration of symptoms before diagnosis was 1.5 years [0-12.1 years]. Microorganisms were identified in 22 patients, predominantly Haemophilus influenzae. Hypogammaglobulinemia was observed in 46.9 % patients. Bronchiectasis was usually extensive (84.8 %). The total bronchiectasis score was 7.4 +- 5.5 with a significant gradient from apex to bases. Many patients remained symptomatic (43.5 %) and/or presented recurrent respiratory tract infections (37.0 %) during follow-up. Six deaths (13 %) occurred during follow-up, but none were attributable to bronchiectasis. CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight that the diagnosis of bronchiectasis should be considered in patients with de novo respiratory symptoms after renal transplantation. Further studies are needed to more clearly understand the mechanisms underlying bronchiectasis in this setting.
30651918	Ruptured Berry Aneurysm as the initial presentation of Polycystic Kidney Disease: A case report and review of literature.	Intra-cranial saccular aneurysms, also known as Berry aneurysms, have a well-known association with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Aneurysmal rupture can be the initial presentation of the disease. ADPKD has two types of gene mutations: PKD1 and PKD2. The latter one is of a milder form presenting later in life. Imaging plays a crucial role in the diagnosis and assessment in order to provide adequate management of these patients however, there are no official standardized guidelines established for screening of these intracranial aneurysms.
30982747	[18F-FDG positron emission tomography in non-oncological renal pathology: Current indications and perspectives].	Positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography (PET/CT) is a nuclear imaging technique which provides anatomical and functional information. PET/CT is increasingly used in non-oncological nephrology since conventional radiological approaches after injection of contrast agents are relatively contra-indicated in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). PET/CT after i.v. injection of 18F-fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG) is not toxic and is characterized by a high sensitivity. The level of irradiation (~5mSv) is acceptable. CKD does not significantly influence tissue uptake of 18F-FDG. The purpose of the present review aims at detailing the non-oncological indications of 18F-FDG PET/CT in general nephrology and after kidney transplantation. Particularly, 18F-FDG PET/CT appears useful in the diagnosis of cyst infection in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, as well as in the characterization of retroperitoneal fibrosis. In kidney transplant recipients, 18F-FDG PET/CT may help in the diagnostic work-up of suspected acute rejection, thereby eventually avoiding unnecessary kidney transplant biopsy. Perspectives in 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging are discussed, including innovative approaches of image analysis.
38691508	Vascular Access Outcomes in Patients with Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD).	BACKGROUND: Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) is a leading hereditary cause of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), often utilising hemodialysis as a form of kidney replacement therapy. Patients with ADPKD may also present with extrarenal manifestations, including arterial aneurysms. The gold standard for hemodialysis access is an arteriovenous vascular access (VA), such fistulas (AVFs) or grafts (AVGs). However, limitations, such as low VA flow and inadequate AVF outward remodelling, impact VA utilization. This study aimed to explore whether ADPKD impacts patency rates of AVFs/AVGs in comparison to other underlying ESKD causes. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from the Swedish Renal Registry from 2011 to 2020, with follow-up until 2022. We included 496 ADPKD patients and 4321 propensity-score matched controls. VA patency rates of ADPKD patients were compared to those of non-ADPKD patients using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and the Mantel-Cox log-rank test. Interventions to maintain or restore patency were also analysed. RESULTS: Patients with ADPKD constituted 8.0% of all patients, with a higher proportion in the pre-ESKD phase during VA creation (51.6% vs. 40.6%). No significant differences were observed in primary, post-cannulation primary, secondary, or functional patency between ADPKD and non-ADPKD patients. However, more VAs were ligated in ADPKD patients (10.5% vs. 7.7%, p=0.03), and they underwent more first interventions to re-establish flow (49.4% vs. 41.9%, p=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that AVF/AVG patency remains comparable in ESKD patients with or without ADPKD, and vascular access monitoring and treatment strategies for ADPKD patients should align with those for individuals with other ESKD causes.
26282281	Peritoneal dialysis as a treatment option in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.	PURPOSE: When choosing a dialysis option for ADPKD patients, peritoneal dialysis (PD) is often discouraged, due to its potential drawbacks: risk of abdominal hernias and dialysis fluid leaks, risk of peritonitis and insufficient dialysis adequacy. The present study was designed to compare the outcomes and dialysis efficacy in ADPKD patients treated with PD, in comparison with non-ADPKD subjects. METHODS: This study was a retrospective analysis of the data from the national PD registry in which 106 ADPKD and 1606 non-ADPKD incident PD patients were evaluated. Data on dialysis adequacy, risk of dialysis-associated complications, as well as patient and technique survival were compared between the groups. RESULTS: The ADPKD patients did not differ from the non-ADPKD controls in terms of dialysis adequacy. After a median observation time of 32 months, there were no differences in patient or technique survival. The risk of abdominal hernias and dialysis fluid leaks was twice as high in ADPKD subjects, compared to the non-ADPKD group. However, these complications did not result in a need for a permanent transfer to hemodialysis. CONCLUSIONS: Dialysis adequacy, and patient and technique survival are similar in the ADPKD and non-ADPKD patients treated with PD. PD seems a feasible treatment option for end-stage renal failure in the course of ADPKD.
24684675	Laparoscopic repair of incisional hernia in solid organ-transplanted patients: the method of choice?	Due to immunosuppressive (IS) therapy, incisional hernias are overrepresented in the organ-transplanted (Tx) population with larger defects, a high rate of recurrence, and a tendency toward more seromas and infectious problems. Thirty-one Tx/IS patients with a control group of 70 non-IS patients with incisional hernia (6/7 recurrences) were included in a prospective interventional study. Both cohorts were treated with laparoscopic ventral hernia repair (LVHR). Follow-up time and rate was 37 months and 95%. One hundred LVHR's were completed as there was one conversion in the Tx/IS group. No late infections or mesh removals occurred. Recurrence rates were 9.7% vs. 4.2% (P = 0.37) and the overall complication rates were 19% vs. 27% (P = 0.80). The Tx/IS group had a higher mesh-protrusion rate (29% vs. 13%, P = 0.09), but also larger hernias. Polycystic kidney disease was overrepresented in the Tx cohort (44% of kidney-Tx). Incisional hernias in Tx/IS patients may be treated by LVHR with the same low complication rate and recurrence rate as non-IS patients. By LVHR, the highly problematic seroma/infection problems encountered in Tx/IS patients treated by conventional open technique seem almost eliminated. The minimally invasive procedure seems particularly rational in the Tx/Is population and should be the method of choice. (ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT00455299, date: 5 May 2006).
27662885	Health-related quality of life across all stages of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.	BACKGROUND: A limited number of studies have assessed health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Results to date have been conflicting and studies have generally focused on patients with later stages of the disease. This study aimed to assess HRQoL in ADPKD across all stages of the disease, from patients with early chronic kidney disease (CKD) to patients with end-stage renal disease. METHODS: A study involving cross-sectional patient-reported outcomes and retrospective clinical data was undertaken April-December 2014 in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. Patients were enrolled into four mutually exclusive stages of the disease: CKD stages 1-3; CKD stages 4-5; transplant recipients; and dialysis patients. RESULTS: Overall HRQoL was generally highest in patients with CKD stages 1-3, followed by transplant recipients, patients with CKD stages 4-5 and patients on dialysis. Progressive disease predominately had an impact on physical health, whereas mental health showed less variation between stages of the disease. A substantial loss in quality of life was observed as patients progressed to CKD stages 4-5. CONCLUSIONS: Later stages of ADPKD are associated with reduced physical health. The value of early treatment interventions that can delay progression of the disease should be considered.
30633365	Pharmacokinetic Evaluation of Nimotuzumab in Patients With Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease.	Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a genetic disease characterized by an overexpression and mislocalization of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) to the apical membranes of cystic epithelial cells. Nimotuzumab is a humanized antibody that recognizes an extracellular domain III of human EGFR. The aim of this study was to assess the pharmacokinetic behavior of nimotuzumab in patients with ADPKD given as a single dose. A phase I, single-center, and noncontrolled open clinical study was conducted. Five patients were enrolled at each of the following fixed-dose levels: 50, 100, 200, and 400 mg. Intravenous continuous infusions of nimotuzumab were administered every 14 days during a year, except the first administration, when blood samples were drawn during 28 days for pharmacokinetic assessments. Subjects were closely monitored during the trial and at completion of the administration of nimotuzumab, including the anti-idiotypic response. For the first time, nimotuzumab was used for treating a nononcological disease. The administration of nimotuzumab showed dose-dependent kinetics. Nimotuzumab does not develop anti-idiotypic response against the murine portion present in the hypervariable region of the antibody present in the serum of the patients treated. No significant differences were found in the systemic clearance between the 100- and 400-mg dose, which indicates that the optimal biological dose is in this range of dose.
27737400	Outcome of renal transplantation from a donor with polycystic kidney disease.	Faced with the long waiting list for a kidney transplant, the use of donors with expanded criteria, like polycystic kidneys, is an option that aims to increase in a short time the supply of kidneys for transplant. This report of two cases of transplants performed from a donor with polycystic kidneys showed promising results, and the receptors evolved with good renal function, serum creatinine measurements within the normal range and with adequate glomerular filtration rate, evaluated over a period of four years post transplant. This fact confirms that the option of using donors with polycystic kidneys is safe and gives good results.
37299584	Diet and Physical Activity in Adult Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease: A Review of the Literature.	Autosomal polycystic kidney disease is the most common inherited kidney disease determining 5% of all end-stage kidney disease. The only therapy approved for this condition is Tolvaptan, which, with its aquaretic effect, has a strong effect on patients' daily life. Recently, the literature has been enriched with new works that analyze possible non-pharmacological therapeutic strategies to slow cysts' enlargement and chronic kidney disease progression. Among them, dietary schemes reducing carbohydrate intake and inducing ketoses have been demonstrated to have efficacy in several pre-clinical and clinical studies. A ketogenic diet, calorie restriction, intermittent fasting, and time-restricted feeding can reduce aerobic glycolysis and inhibit the mTOR pathway, producing a reduction in cyst cell proliferation, a reduction in kidney volume, and helping to preserve kidney function. ADPKD's burden of disease has an impact on patients' quality of life, and the possibility to play sports or carry out physical exercise can help people in everyday life. The multisystemic character of the disease, especially cardiovascular involvement, needs to be carefully evaluated to establish the quality and quantity of physical activity that patients can safely carry out.

30228150	A Practical Guide for Treatment of Rapidly Progressive ADPKD with Tolvaptan.	In the past, the treatment of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) has been limited to the management of its symptoms and complications. Recently, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved tolvaptan as the first drug treatment to slow kidney function decline in adults at risk of rapidly progressing ADPKD. Full prescribing information approved by the FDA provides helpful guidelines but does not address practical questions that are being raised by nephrologists, internists, and general practitioners taking care of patients with ADPKD, and by the patients themselves. In this review, we provide practical guidance and discuss steps that require consideration before and after prescribing tolvaptan to patients with ADPKD to ensure that this treatment is implemented safely and effectively. These steps include confirmation of diagnosis; identification of rapidly progressive disease; implementation of basic renal protective measures; counseling of patients on potential benefits and harms; exclusions to use; education of patients on aquaresis and its expected consequences; initiation, titration, and optimization of tolvaptan treatment; prevention of aquaresis-related complications; evaluation and management of liver enzyme elevations; and monitoring of treatment efficacy. Our recommendations are made on the basis of published evidence and our collective experiences during the randomized, clinical trials and open-label extension studies of tolvaptan in ADPKD.
34881827	[Management of native kidneys in renal transplant recipients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney].	Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is responsible for 10 % of end-stage renal failure cases in Europe and the majority of these patients will have their renal failure treated with kidney transplantation. In this context, native kidneys will have a negligible function but maybe the source of a series of complications, whether due to polycystosis or immunosuppression. These complications include urinary tract infections, renal neoplasms, high blood pressure and abdominal pain and must be managed specifically for this particular context. Native nephrectomy may also be considered to prevent these complications, but it is a serious procedure and the risk-benefit ratio must be carefully assessed. There are still no clear and consensual guidelines on the indications for this nephrectomy or on the ideal timing of it in relation to the transplant procedure. Nevertheless, a review of the various data in the literature allows us to suggest an algorithm to help the therapeutic decision.
28989174	New treatment paradigms for ADPKD: moving towards precision medicine.	The natural history of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is characterized by a variable rate of cyst development and increase in total kidney volume (TKV), variable kidney function decline and age of onset of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and variable presentation of renal and extrarenal manifestations. Precision medicine is proposed to improve patient outcomes by tailoring therapy to the specific genetic background, pathophysiology, disease burden, prognosis and status of each individual. This approach to the management of patients with ADPKD is nearing clinical implementation owing to advances in genetics, imaging, biomarker development and therapeutics. In this Review, we discuss pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for the treatment of hypertension and proteinuria, and for slowing the rate of cyst growth in patients with ADPKD before the development of ESRD. We provide recommendations for the management of renal complications, including cyst infection, nephrolithiasis, haematuria and chronic pain. The early treatment of patients with ADPKD who are largely asymptomatic is associated with a therapeutic burden but slows cyst growth and delays subsequent loss of kidney function, which ultimately delays the need for renal replacement therapy and has a positive effect on the quality of life of patients.
29069013	Incidentally polycystic kidney disease identified by SPECT/CT with post-therapy radioiodine scintigraphy in a patient with differentiated thyroid carcinoma: A case report.	RATIONALE: Post-therapy or diagnostic whole-body radioiodine scintigraphy is widely employed to evaluate the residual, recurrence, or metastases of differentiated thyroid carcinoma because of the high sensitivity and accuracy. However, it has pitfalls. PATIENT CONCERNS: We described a 63-year-old male with a history of papillary thyroid carcinoma who was referred for iodine-131 ablation therapy. The post-therapy iodine-131 whole-body images demonstrated abnormal increased uptake of the tracer in the regions of bilateral upper abdomen. DIAGNOSES: The single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) showed the abnormal Iactivity was corresponded to multiple irregular cystic low densities in the both kidneys on the low-dose computed tomography images, so the diagnosis of polycystic kidney disease was confirmed. INTERVENTIONS AND OUTCOMES: The patient responded well to the lifestyle-based treatments. LESSONS: Polycystic kidney disease was one of the etiologies of the false-positive findings in the radioiodine scintigraphy.
31022403	Lanreotide Reduces Liver Growth In Patients With Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Liver and Kidney Disease.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Polycystic liver disease is the most common extrarenal manifestation of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). There is need for robust long-term evidence for the volume-reducing effect of somatostatin analogues. We made use of data from an open-label, randomized trial to determine the effects of lanreotide on height-adjusted liver volume (hTLV) and combined height-adjusted liver and kidney volume (hTLKV) in patients with ADPKD. METHODS: We performed a 120-week study comparing the reno-protective effects of lanreotide vs standard care in 305 patients with ADPKD (the DIPAK-1 study). For this analysis, we studied the 175 patients with polycystic liver disease with hepatic cysts identified by magnetic resonance imaging and liver volume >=2000 mL. Of these, 93 patients were assigned to a group that received lanreotide (120 mg subcutaneously every 4 weeks) and 82 to a group that received standard care (blood pressure control, a sodium-restricted diet, and antihypertensive agents). The primary endpoint was percent change in hTLV between baseline and end of treatment (week 120). A secondary endpoint was change in hTLKV. RESULTS: At 120 weeks, hTLV decreased by 1.99% in the lanreotide group (95% confidence interval [CI], -4.21 to 0.24) and increased by 3.92% in the control group (95% CI, 1.56-6.28). Compared with the control group, lanreotide reduced the growth of hTLV by 5.91% (95% CI, -9.18 to -2.63; P < .001). Growth of hTLV was still reduced by 3.87% at 4 months after the last injection of lanreotide compared with baseline (95% CI, -7.55 to -0.18; P = .04). Lanreotide reduced growth of hTLKV by 7.18% compared with the control group (95% CI, -10.25 to -4.12; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: In this subanalysis of a randomized trial of patients with polycystic liver disease due to ADPKD, lanreotide for 120 weeks reduced the growth of liver and combined liver and kidney volume. This effect was still present 4 months after the last injection of lanreotide. ClinicalTrials.gov, Number: NCT01616927.
27650472	Combination drug versus monotherapy for the treatment of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.	INTRODUCTION: Despite progress in the understanding of pathogenetic mechanisms of organ cyst formation in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, current treatment methods are insufficient. Experimental studies and clinical trials target at inhibition of cysts development and to slowing CKD progression. AREAS COVERED: The purpose of this analysis is to overview available literature regarding treatment of ADPKD. The most important recent events concerning ADPKD treatment are: the results of TEMPO 3/4 study and the registration of tolvaptan in the treatment of patients with CKD stage I-III and rapidly progressive ADPKD by EMA. ERA-EDTA recommendations for use of tolvaptan in ADPKD of 2016 will be useful for the identification of patients with rapid progression of disease who will benefit most from treatment. Clinical trials concerning inhibitors of mTOR and SSAs have not delivered convincing evidence of their effectiveness. Usefulness of statins in ADPKD require confirmation in adults. The HALT-PKD study confirmed that inhibition of RAA system slows progression of ADPKD. EXPERT OPINION: Current treatment of ADPKD involves: the optimization of life style and combined pharmacological treatment with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, statins (patients with lipid disorders and cardiovascular disease) and tolvaptan (patients with stage I-III CKD and rapidly progressive ADPKD).
31502043	Intracranial aneurysms in patients receiving kidney transplantation for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.	BACKGROUND: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common inherited kidney disease, leading to kidney failure. One of the most serious extrarenal complications of ADPKD is comorbid intracranial aneurysms. The aim of this study is to evaluate the prevalence, rupture rate, and treatment outcomes of intracranial aneurysms in ADPKD. METHODS: Adult patients with a documented diagnosis of ADPKD who received kidney transplantation at our center from January 1994 to December 2018 were included in the study. Medical history, physical examination, laboratory findings, imaging studies, and operation records were collected and analyzed from our database. RESULTS: Among 154 kidney transplant recipients with ADPKD, 113 (73.4%) patients were screened for intracranial aneurysms preoperatively. Twenty three patients (14.9%) had intracranial aneurysms with mean diameter size of 4.5 +- 2.7 mm. Nine patients (5.8%) experienced aneurysm rupture and the mean age at time of rupture was 34.9 +- 9.3 years. Twelve patients (52.2%) presented with multiple aneurysms. The most common aneurysm location was the bifurcation of the middle cerebral artery (34.9%). Clipping was the most common treatment in both ruptured and unruptured aneurysms. CONCLUSIONS: Intracranial aneurysms are more frequent in patients with ADPKD, and the average age of intracranial artery rupture in patients with ADPKD is earlier than in the general population. It is necessary to consider proper evaluation and management of intracranial aneurysms when counseling ADPKD patients who will undergo kidney transplantation.
27732751	Center is an important indicator for choice of invasive therapy in polycystic liver disease.	Polycystic liver disease (PLD) is a rare genetic disorder with progressive cyst growth as the primary phenotype. Therapy consists of volume reduction through invasive surgical or radiological procedures. To understand the process of treatment decision, our aim was to identify factors that increased the likelihood of treatment. We performed a cross-sectional study using an international population of patients with PLD. We collected data on the following therapies: liver transplantation, resection, fenestration, and aspiration sclerotherapy. Data on the potential determinants, sex, center, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease (ADPLD), age at diagnosis, symptoms, and phenotype, were included. We corrected for follow-up time. We included 578 patients in our study, and 35% underwent invasive therapy. Multivariate regression analysis showed that number of symptoms and age at diagnosis of PLD increased the likelihood of treatment (respectively, RR: 1.4, P < 0.001 and RR = 1.4, P = 0.03). The choice for liver transplantation or aspiration sclerotherapy was center dependent (RR: 0.7, P < 0.001 and RR: 1.1, P = 0.03, respectively). The results of our international cross-sectional study suggest that a higher number of symptoms and every 10 years of PLD diagnosis increase the risk to undergo treatment by 40%. The choice to elect a particular modality is center dependent.
33094512	Peritoneal dialysis patient selection from a comorbidity perspective.	Despite many medical and socioeconomic advantages, peritoneal dialysis (PD) is an underutilized dialysis modality that in most countries is used by only 5%-20% of dialysis patients, while the vast majority are treated with in-center hemodialysis. Several factors may explain this paradox, such as lack of experience and infrastructure for training and monitoring of PD patients, organizational issues, overcapacity of hemodialysis facilities, and lack of economic incentives for dialysis centers to use PD instead of HD. In addition, medical conditions that are perceived (rightly or wrongly) as contraindications to PD represent barriers for the use of PD because of their purported potential negative impact on clinical outcomes in patients starting PD. While there are few absolute contraindications to PD, high age, comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, obesity, polycystic kidney disease, heart failure, and previous history of abdominal surgery and renal allograft failure, may be seen (rightly or wrongly) as relative contraindications and thus barriers to initiation of PD. In this brief review, we discuss how the presence of these conditions may influence the strategy of selecting patients for PD, focusing on measures that can be taken to overcome potential problems.
31664917	Two cases of fungal cyst infection in ADPKD: is this really a rare complication?	BACKGROUND: Cyst infection is a prevalent complication in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) patients, however therapeutic and diagnostic approaches towards this condition remain unclear. The confirmation of a likely episode of cyst infection by isolating the pathogenic microorganism in a clinical scenario is possible only in the minority of cases. The available antimicrobial treatment guidelines, therefore, might not be appropriate to some patients. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe two unique cases of kidney cyst infection by Candida albicans, a condition that has not been previously described in literature. Both cases presented clear risk factors for Candida spp. infection. However, since there was no initial indication of cyst aspiration and culture, antifungal therapy was not immediately started and empirical treatment was initiated as recommended by the current guidelines. Antifungal treatment was instituted in both cases along the clinical course, according to their specificities. CONCLUSION: Our report highlights the possibility of Candida spp. cyst infection. Failure of clinical improvement with antibiotics should raise the suspicion of a fungal infection. Identification of infected cysts should be pursued in such cases, particularly with PET-CT, and when technically possible followed by cyst aspiration and culture to guide treatment. Risk factors for this condition, such as Candida spp. colonization, previous antimicrobial therapy, hemodialysis, necrotizing pancreatitis, gastrointestinal/hepatobiliary surgical procedure, central venous catheter, total parenteral nutrition, diabetes mellitus and immunodeficiency (neutropenia < 500 neutrophils/mL, hematologic malignancy, chemotherapy, immunosuppressant drugs), should be also considered accepted criteria for empirical antifungal therapy.
26670891	Early bilateral nephrectomy in infantile autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease.	The management of neonatal autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) complicated by severe pulmonary insufficiency presents complex clinical challenges. Where massive nephromegaly exists, early bilateral nephrectomy, supportive peritoneal dialysis and early aggressive nutrition can minimise infant mortality. Consensus, however, is lacking on the role and optimal timing of nephrectomy, with decision-making driven by the patient's clinical condition and the expertise of the centre. We report on our experience of an infant with ARPKD requiring neonatal renal replacement therapy and survival at 14 months following early bilateral nephrectomy.
