input_text: "Calcutta position: A new modified supine decubitus for supine PCNL. INTRODUCTION:
  PCNL (percutaneous nephrolithotripsy) is considered the gold standard treatment
  for renal stone more than 2 cm. In today's scenario, supine PCNL is considered equally
  effective as prone PCNL. The ideal position for supine PCNL is still debatable.
  We hereby describe our initial experiences of supine PCNL in a novel position. METHODS
  AND MATERIALS: This prospective study includes 60 patients who underwent supine
  PCNL in the 'Calcutta position' in our institute from August 2021 to August 2022.
  Successful procedure was defined as a complete stone free rate or a clinically insignificant
  residual stone (<4 mm). RESULTS: Average Operative room (OR) occupancy time was
  130.9 +- 19.63 min. The immediate stone free rate was 84.2%, 71.4% and 37.5% for
  single, multiple and staghorn calculus respectively. Complications include fever,
  requirement of blood transfusions and renal colic. The average hospital stay was
  83.6 +- 17.42 h. Eight patients (13.3%) required secondary procedures like extracorporeal
  shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) or relook PCNL. At 3 months average stone free rates
  were 92%, 85%, 75% for single, multiple and staghorn calculus respectively. We performed
  supine PCNL in Calcutta position in obese, kyphoscoliosis, poliomyelitis, autosomal
  polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), malrotated kidney and diverticular stone with
  comparable success. CONCLUSION: Supine PCNL in Calcutta position is a safe and effective
  option for nephrolithiasis management. Apart from the inherent advantages of supine
  PCNL it also has the advantages of better C-Arm and nephroscope manoeuvrability.
  Supine PCNL in Calcutta position was performed in a variety of scenarios with comparable
  results."
