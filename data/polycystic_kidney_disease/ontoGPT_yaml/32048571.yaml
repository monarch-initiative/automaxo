input_text: 'Long-term aneurysm recurrence and de novo aneurysm formation after surgical
  treatment of unruptured intracranial aneurysms: a cohort study and systematic review.
  Objective: There is a relative lack of literature on long-term aneurysm recurrence
  and de novo aneurysm formation following surgical treatment of unruptured intracranial
  aneurysms. This retrospective single-center cohort study, therefore, analyzes the
  incidence of aneurysm recurrence, and the incidence of de novo aneurysms formation
  in patients with at least 10yrs of radiological follow-up. The data are put into
  the context of a systematic review of the literature.Methods: Patients that underwent
  surgical treatment of an unruptured intracranial aneurysm at the Basel University
  Hospital were retrospectively identified. The rate of recurrent or de novo aneurysm
  formation was assessed for all patients with imaging follow-up >=10yrs. A systematic
  review including studies with a mean follow-up period of >=10yrs was then performed.Results:
  A total of 95 patients had undergone surgical treatment of an unruptured intracranial
  aneurysm between 1994 and 2008. Twenty-one patients (22.1%) had available imaging
  follow-up >=10yrs (mean: 13.1yrs). In these patients, aneurysm recurrence and de
  novo aneurysm formation were equally found in 23.8% (n = 5; 1.8%/yr). There was
  no case of aneurysm rupture from a recurrent or a de novo aneurysm. The systematic
  literature review covered a combined cohort of 1778 patients over a mean follow-up
  period of 14.0yrs. In this cohort, the aneurysm recurrence rate was 16.4% (0.7%/yr),
  and the rate of de novo aneurysm formation was 6.2% (0.4%/yr).Discussion: Despite
  some discrepancy regarding the incidence, both cohorts show a non-negligible long-term
  risk of aneurysm recurrence and de novo aneurysm formation, which warrants life-long
  imaging follow-up.Abbreviations: SD: standard deviation; DSA: digital subtraction
