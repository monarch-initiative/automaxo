input_text: 'Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease and Intracranial Aneurysms:
  Is There an Increased Risk of Treatment? BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Autosomal dominant
  polycystic kidney disease is associated with an increased risk of intracranial aneurysms.
  Our purpose was to assess whether there is an increased risk during aneurysm coiling
  and clipping. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were obtained from the National Inpatient
  Sample (2000-2011). All subjects had an unruptured aneurysm clipped or coiled and
  were divided into polycystic kidney (n = 189) and control (n = 3555) groups. Primary
  end points included in-hospital mortality, length of stay, and total hospital charges.
  Secondary end points included the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth
  Revision codes for iatrogenic hemorrhage or infarction; intracranial hemorrhage;
  embolic infarction; and carotid and vertebral artery dissections. RESULTS: There
  was a significantly greater incidence of iatrogenic hemorrhage or infarction, embolic
  infarction, and carotid artery dissection in the patients with polycystic kidney
  disease compared with the control group after endovascular coiling. There was also
  a significantly greater incidence of iatrogenic hemorrhage or infarction in the
  polycystic kidney group after surgical clipping. However, the hospital stay was
  not longer in the polycystic kidney group, and the total hospital charges were not
  higher. Additional analysis within the polycystic kidney group revealed a significantly
  shorter length of stay but similar in-hospital costs when subjects underwent coiling
  versus clipping. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with polycystic kidney disease face an increased
  risk during intracranial aneurysm treatment, whether by coiling or clipping. This
  risk, however, does not translate into longer hospital stays or increased hospital
  costs. Despite the additional catheterization-related risks of dissection and embolization,
  coiling results in shorter hospital stays and similar mortality compared with clipping.'
