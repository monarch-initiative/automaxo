input_text: 'A Retrospective Case-Control Study on Late Failure of Arteriovenous Fistula
  in Hemodialysis Patients and Prediction of Risk Factors. Objective: A retrospective
  case-control study was conducted to explore the risk factors of late failure of
  arteriovenous fistula in hemodialysis patients. Methods: A total of 95 hemodialysis
  patients treated in our hospital from January 2018 to January 2021 were included.
  The HE staining results of late failure of arteriovenous fistula in hemodialysis
  patients were observed. The general data and laboratory indexes of the patients
  were recorded by using a questionnaire survey, hospital case system, and hemodialysis
  record. According to the functional status of internal fistula, the patients were
  divided into two groups: failure group (n = 35) and patency group (n = 60). SPSS22.0
  software was employed for statistical analysis, and the relevant data of the two
  groups were compared. The independent sample t-test was employed for the comparison
  of variance between groups, and the chi 2 test was employed for counting data. Logistic
  multivariate regression was employed to analyze the risk factors of late loss of
  power in autologous arteriovenous fistula (AVF). Results: (1) Late failure of arteriovenous
  fistula in hemodialysis patients: the results of HE staining showed the following:
  (1) histological changes of venous intima: 100% of the patients had varying degrees
  of intimal hyperplasia, mainly eccentric hyperplasia, resulting in luminal stenosis,
  and annular uniform intimal hyperplasia in some patients, and (2) histological changes
  of venous media: 81.6% of the patients had venous media lesions, which were mainly
  in two cases; one was media smooth muscle hyperplasia with fibrous tissue hyperplasia,
  and the other was smooth muscle compression when intimal hyperplasia was serious,
  resulting in smooth muscle fiber rupture, disarrangement, focal necrosis, atrophy,
  and thinning, and some smooth muscle stroma showed vitreous degeneration and myxoid
  degeneration. A few cases showed multifocal neutrophil, lymphocyte, and plasma cell
  infiltration. (2) First of all, we surveyed the general data, and there were significant
  differences in age, history of diabetes, history of hypertension, and uric acid
  nephropathy (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in sex, body mass index,
  smoking history, polycystic kidney disease, chronic glomerulonephritis, and obstructive
  nephropathy between the two groups (P > 0.05). Secondly, we compared the levels
  of hemoglobin, eosinophils, platelet count, and hematocrit. The levels of hemoglobin,
  eosinophils, and hematocrit in the failure group were higher, and the platelet count
  was lower compared to that of the unobstructed group (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the
  calcium and phosphorus product and the level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the
  failure group were higher, while the levels of fibrinogen and INR in the unobstructed
  group were lower. The levels of plasma protein, alkaline phosphatase, and cholesterol
  were higher in the failure group, while the level of triglyceride was lower in the
  failure group (P < 0.05). Finally, logistic regression analysis showed that age,
  hemoglobin, hematocrit, and calcium-phosphorus product were the risk factors for
  late failure of arteriovenous fistula in hemodialysis patients (P < 0.05). There
  exhibited no significant correlation between diabetes, hypertension, uric acid nephropathy,
  eosinophil, CRP, fibrinogen, INR, plasma protein, alkaline phosphatase, cholesterol,
  triglyceride, and late failure of arteriovenous fistula in hemodialysis patients.
  Conclusion: Age, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and calcium-phosphorus product are independent
  risk factors for late failure of arteriovenous fistula in hemodialysis patients.
  The hemoglobin, eosinophil, platelet count, and hematocele in hemodialysis patients
  with late failure of arteriovenous fistula were higher. The indexes related to biochemistry,
  blood coagulation, and nutrition were significantly different from those without
  late failure of arteriovenous fistula. Thus, the risk of late failure of arteriovenous
  fistula can be predicted.'
