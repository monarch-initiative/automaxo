  Patients with Enlarged Polycystic Kidneys. PURPOSE: To evaluate the safety and effectiveness
  of transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) with ethanol in symptomatic patients
  with enlarged polycystic kidney disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective
  study was institutional review board approved and was planned for patients with
  symptoms related to enlarged polycystic kidney disease, such as a markedly distended
  abdomen, gastroesophageal reflux, and abdominal pain. At the time of TAE, all patients
  were undergoing dialysis therapy for chronic renal failure, and their urinary volume
  had decreased to less than 500 mL per day. Bilateral renal TAE with absolute ethanol
  was performed, and changes in kidney volume, clinical symptoms, laboratory data,
  and complications were evaluated after TAE. The differences in patients' kidney
  volumes, clinical symptoms, abdominal circumference, and dry weights before and
  after TAE were analyzed with a mixed effect model. RESULTS: Fifteen patients (seven
  men and eight women; mean age, 57.7 years +- 5.3 [standard deviation]) were treated.
  Among the 15 patients, the follow-up period was 24 months in 13 patients, 6 months
  in one patient, and 3 months in one patient. The mean kidney volume was 3380 mL
  before renal TAE, and at 3, 12, and 24 months after TAE, it significantly decreased
  to 60.9%, 39.8%, and 32.1% of the pretherapeutic value, respectively (P < .001).
  All patients reported improved clinical symptoms within 3 months after TAE (P <
  .001). Abdominal circumferences were significantly decreased after TAE (P < .001).
  The dry weights also continued to significantly decreased until 6 months after TAE
  (P < .001), at which point they began to slightly increase until 24 months after
  TAE. Abdominal pain, nausea, and inflammatory response developed in all patients
  after TAE, but these symptoms improved with conservative treatment. Abscess formation
  was found in one kidney, and drainage catheter placement was performed. No major
  complications related to TAE occurred in the remaining patients. CONCLUSION: Renal
  contraction therapy by TAE with ethanol injection appears to be a safe and effective
  treatment in patients with symptomatic enlarged polycystic kidney disease."
