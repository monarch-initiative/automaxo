input_text: 'Cutaneous Manifestations of Tuberous Sclerosis. Dear Editor, Tuberous
  sclerosis (TS) is an autosomal dominant multisystem disease, which occurs due to
  genetically determined hyperplasia of ectodermal and mesodermal cells. Clinical
  manifestations present on the skin and in the nervous system, kidneys, heart, and
  other organs. Recent studies estimate the incidence of TS at 1/6000 to 1/10,000
  live births, and a prevalence in the general population of approximately 1 in 20,000
  (1). There are two different genetic loci responsible for TS: 9q34 (TSC1-hamartin)
  and 16p13.3 (TSC2-tuberin) (2). Cutaneous manifestations occur in about 96% of patients
  (3). Neurological disorders occur in 50% of patients in the form of seizures and
  motor and psychomotor symptomatology (4). A 19-year-old male patient was hospitalized
  for clinical and diagnostic evaluation in February 2016 year in Clinic for Nephrology,
  Clinical Center of Montenegro, Podgorica, Montenegro. Polycystic kidney changes
  were verified by ultrasound when the patient was three years old, with the presence
  of several calcified nodules in lateral ventricles and supraventricularly in the
  brain as well as the existence of several hypopigmented maculae on the skin. During
  the last hospitalization in February 2016, the following tests were performed: cranial
  magnet resonance imaging (MRI) findings showed the existence of visible changes
  in the signal in the form of ectopic tuber tissue in the region of the cortex and
  subcortical white matter of the brain, but without neurological and psychomotor
  abnormalities; ultrasound of the urinary tract showed that both kidneys were enlarged
  with multiple cysts, with dominant cysts at the lower pole of the right kidney with
  a size of 55 mm and at the upper pole of the left kidney, approximately 40 mm. Reduced
  functional capacity of kidneys was found on dynamic scintigraphy, slightly more
  in the left kidney (41%) compared with the right (59%). Electroencephalography,
  X-ray of the lungs and heart, and echocardiography were also performed, but without
  any pathological findings. Dermatological examination found numerous fibroma up
  to 0.5 cm in diameter, the largest located nasolabially, periorally, and on the
  chin skin (Figure 1) at the age of seven, whereas a fibroma and several white maculae
  were present from birth on the skin of the forehead. They were now also present
  on the skin of the trunk and on the upper and lower extremities (Figure 2), accompanied
  by surrounding minor changes in the form of confetti-like maculae. A subungual fibroma
  was present on the third finger of the right hand. Collagen nevus (shagreen patch)
  (5), i.e. a subepidermal fibrosis as a mildly elevated, palm-sized area is also
  characteristic of TS, which is described in literature, in most cases in the lumbosacral
  region. In our case, such a fibrosis about 3 cm in diameter, and with the consistency
  of an orange peel, was discovered on the right shoulder. Subungual fibromas (Koenen
  tumors) (6), which can develop in adolescence, were present in our patient on the
  third finger of the right hand. The diagnosis of TS was established based on genetic
  testing, physical examination, ultrasound-verified polycystic kidney disease and
  reduced global renal functions, intracranial MRI, many hypomelanotic changes, and
  angiofibromas found with dermatological examination (7). There is no specific therapeutic
  approach for TS, and the treatment is symptomatic. Angiofibromas of the skin can
  be removed by dermabrasion or laser. Recent data show a good therapeutic effect
  of applying 0.1% rapamycin (8), which leads to a reduction of angiofibromas in patients
  with TS. On dermatological follow up after five weeks of application of tacrolimus,
  angiofibromas of the face were in regression. Some studies suggest the simultaneous
  topical applications of both of those drugs (9). In adolescents and adults of reproductive
  age, genetic counseling is recommended (10).'
