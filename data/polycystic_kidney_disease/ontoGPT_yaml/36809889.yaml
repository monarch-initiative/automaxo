input_text: "Native nephrectomy in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney
  disease in the kidney transplant program - single-center retrospective results of
  2000-2020. INTRODUCTION: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is
  a genetic disease that leads to chronic renal failure in about half of patients.
  It is a multisystemic disease with a predominance of kidney involvement, which significantly
  worsens the patient's health. Controversial issues include the indication and the
  timing and technique of nephrectomy of native polycystic kidneys. METHODS: A retrospective
  observational study focused on the surgical aspects of patients with ADPKD who underwent
  native nephrectomy at our institution. The group included patients operated on in
  the period 1/1/2000-31/12/2020. A total of 115 patients with ADPKD were enrolled
  (14.7% of all transplant recipients). We evaluated the basic demographic data, type
  of surgery, indications and complications in this group. RESULTS: Native nephrectomy
  was performed in 68 out of a total of 115 (59%) patients. Unilateral nephrectomy
  was done in 22 (32%) patients and bilateral in 46 (68%). The most common indications
  were infections (42 patients, 36%), pain (31 patients, 27%), hematuria (14 patients,
  12%), gastrointestinal reasons (1 patient, 1%), respiratory reasons (1 patient,
  1%), obtaining a site for transplantation (17 patients, 15%) and suspected tumor
  (5 patients, 4%). CONCLUSION: Native nephrectomy is recommended in symptomatic kidneys,
  or in asymptomatic kidneys when it is necessary to obtain a place for kidney transplantation,
  and in kidneys where a tumor is suspected."
