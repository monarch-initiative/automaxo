input_text: 'Experience and Utility of the Protocol Kidney Biopsy in the First Year
  of Kidney Transplantation. BACKGROUND: Protocol kidney biopsy (PKB) in kidney transplant
  is a useful tool for graft monitoring because the subclinical detection of histologic
  lesions helps to modulate immunosuppression. We analyze our experience. METHODS:
  We performed a descriptive study that analyzed the PKB results at the fourth to
  sixth month and the first year post transplant of patients with kidney transplant
  followed in our hospital between January 2015 and June 2021. RESULTS: A total of
  100 patients and 134 biopsy results were included, of which 71 were obtained between
  the fourth and sixth month and 63 at the first year. The mean age was 57.8 years,
  and 66% were men. Unknown etiology was the most common underlying kidney disease
  (31%), followed by diabetes mellitus (15%) and polycystic kidney disease (14%).
  A total of 80% had panel-reactive antibody < 50%. Induction therapy consisted of
  thymoglobulin (51%) and basiliximab (49%), and maintenance therapy consisted of
  corticosteroids and tacrolimus (100%), mycophenolate mofetil (82%), and mammalian
  target of rapamycin inhibitor (18%). Of the total of the PKB results (n = 134),
  19 episodes of subclinical rejection (14%) and 10 with borderline changes (7.4%)
  were observed. Regarding other findings, there were cases of nephrocalcinosis (4.4%),
  immunoglobulin A nephropathy (2.2%), and BK nephropathy (1.5%). The PKB brought
  about a change in the therapeutic attitude in 45 cases (33%) of the total number
  of biopsies, the most frequent change being the administration of boluses of methylprednisolone
  (12.6%) and the change to mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor (8.9%). CONCLUSIONS:
  In our experience, PKB is a useful tool for monitoring and evaluating histologic
  changes without clinical expression in the kidney graft, allowing us to adapt the
  treatment during the first year of kidney transplant.'
