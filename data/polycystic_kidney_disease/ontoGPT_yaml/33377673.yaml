input_text: '[Simultaneous laparoscopic bilateral nephrectomy as a preparation for
  kidney transplantation in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease].
  AIM: to study the possibility and safety of performing simultaneous bilateral laparoscopic
  nephrectomy in symptomatic patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease
  (ADPKD) as a preparation for kidney transplantation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From
  May 2018 to September 2019, six symptomatic patients with end-stage renal disease
  caused by ADPKD, who had hemodialysis, underwent simultaneous bilateral laparoscopic
  nephrectomy. The mean vertical kidney size according to CT data was 211.67+/-37.15
  mm, the mean horizontal size was 145.36+/-19.53 mm. In 5 cases, the hand-assisted
  procedure was performed. RESULTS: The average duration of the procedure was 225.1+/-40.37
  minutes. Postoperative complications were recorded in 2 (33.2%) patients. The average
  length of stay was 8.83+/-2.13 days. There were no clinical manifestations of adrenal
  insufficiency. All patients are alive. In two patients, cadaveric kidney transplantation
  was performed after laparoscopic bilateral nephrectomy. CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic
  bilateral nephrectomy in patients with chronic renal failure associated with ADPKD
  is feasible, safe and is associated with a short length of stay. This procedure
  improves the quality of life of patients and facilitates subsequent kidney transplantation.'
