input_text: Dynamics of the erythropoiesis stimulating agent resistance index in incident
  hemodiafiltration and high-flux hemodialysis patients. Hyporesponsiveness to erythropoiesis-stimulating
  agent therapy in dialysis patients is poorly understood. Some studies report an
  improvement in the erythropoiesis-stimulating agent resistance index (ERI) with
  hemodiafiltration (HDF) versus high-flux hemodialysis (HD). We explored ERI dynamics
  in 38,340 incident HDF and HD patients treated in 22 countries over a 7-year period.
  Groups were matched by propensity score at baseline (6 months after dialysis initiation).
  The follow-up period (mean of 1.31 years) was stratified into 1 month intervals
  with delta analyses performed for key ERI-related parameters. Dialysis modality,
  time interval, and polycystic kidney disease were included in a linear mixed model
  with the outcome ERI. Baseline ERI was nonsignificantly higher in HDF versus HD
  treatment. ERI decreased significantly faster in HDF-treated patients than in HD-treated
  patients, was decreased in both HD and HDF when patients were treated with intravenous
  darbepoetin alfa, but only in HDF when treated with intravenous recombinant human
  erythropoietin (rHuEPO). A clear difference between HD- and HDF-treated patients
  could only be found for patients with high baseline ERI and assigned to intravenous
  rHuEPO treatment. A significant advantage in terms of lower ERI for patients treated
  by HDF was found. Sensitivity analysis limited this advantage for HDF to those patients
  treated with intravenous rHuEPO (not darbepoetin alfa or subcutaneous rHuEPO) and
  to patients with a high baseline ERI. Thus, our results allow more accurate planning
  for future clinical trials addressing anemia management in dialysis patients.
