input_text: 'Preoperative Echocardiographic Differences and Transplant Outcomes Among
  Patients Receiving Simultaneous Liver-Kidney Versus Liver Transplant Alone. OBJECTIVES:
  Liver transplant and simultaneous liver-kidney transplant are major surgeries performed
  on high-risk individuals with end-stage liver disease and end-stage renal disease.
  We sought to examine the relationship between pretransplant echocardiographic parameters
  and outcomes in our simultaneous liver-kidney transplant and liver transplant-alone
  populations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In our retrospective analysis, we included adult
  patients who underwent index transplant from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2015
  at Johns Hopkins Comprehensive Transplant Center. RESULTS: Our study included 312
  patients, 266 who underwent liver transplant alone and 46 who underwent simultaneous
  liver-kidney transplant. Baseline population demographics were similar in both groups
  of patients. Primary diagnosis at transplant was similar in both groups except that
  patients undergoing liver transplant were more likely to have a diagnosis of hepatocellular
  carcinoma, whereas those undergoing simultaneous liver-kidney transplant were more
  likely to have polycystic kidney disease. Within the liver transplant-alone group,
  the strongest demographic predictor of poor outcome was age at transplant. The strongest
  echocar diographic predictors were related to elevated left ventricular ejection
  fraction and right ventricular systolic pressure. CONCLUSIONS: In our investigation
  regarding whether the pretransplant cardiovascular evaluation predicted outcomes
  for patients undergoing liver transplant alone and patients undergoing simultaneous
  liver-kidney transplant, we found that elevations in right ventricular systolic
  pressure and left ventricular ejection fraction may be associated with poor outcomes
  in the posttransplant period.'
