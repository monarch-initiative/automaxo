input_text: 'Risk Factors for Early Dialysis Dependency in Autosomal Recessive Polycystic
  Kidney Disease. OBJECTIVE: To identify prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal risk factors
  for dialysis within the first year of life in children with autosomal recessive
  polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) as a basis for parental counseling after prenatal
  and perinatal diagnosis. STUDY DESIGN: A dataset comprising 385 patients from the
  ARegPKD international registry study was analyzed for potential risk markers for
  dialysis during the first year of life. RESULTS: Thirty-six out of 385 children
  (9.4%) commenced dialysis in the first year of life. According to multivariable
  Cox regression analysis, the presence of oligohydramnios or anhydramnios, prenatal
  kidney enlargement, a low Apgar score, and the need for postnatal breathing support
  were independently associated with an increased hazard ratio for requiring dialysis
  within the first year of life. The increased risk associated with Apgar score and
  perinatal assisted breathing was time-dependent and vanished after 5 and 8 months
  of life, respectively. The predicted probabilities for early dialysis varied from
  1.5% (95% CI, 0.5%-4.1%) for patients with ARPKD with no prenatal sonographic abnormalities
  to 32.3% (95% CI, 22.2%-44.5%) in cases of documented oligohydramnios or anhydramnios,
  renal cysts, and enlarged kidneys. CONCLUSIONS: This study, which identified risk
  factors associated with onset of dialysis in ARPKD in the first year of life, may
  be helpful in prenatal parental counseling in cases of suspected ARPKD.'
