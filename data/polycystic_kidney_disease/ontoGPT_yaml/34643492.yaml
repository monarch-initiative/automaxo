input_text: "Clinical characteristics of Slovenian pediatric patients with autosomal
  recessive polycystic kidney disease. AIMS: Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney
  disease (ARPKD) is a rare inherited disease. We reviewed the clinical characteristics,
  management, and outcomes in Slovenian pediatric patients with ARPKD. MATERIALS AND
  METHODS: All patients with ARPKD who were treated at the Pediatric Nephrology Department
  of the University Children's Hospital in Ljubljana between 1980 and 2020 were included
  in the study. The data were assessed retrospectively by reviewing the patients'
  medical records and analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: We included
  13 patients, 6 boys and 7 girls. A prenatal diagnosis was established in 3 (23%)
  patients. In 4 (31%) patients, the diagnosis was confirmed within the first few
  days of life, while in 6 (46%) patients the disease manifested later during childhood.
  Four babies (31%) needed ventilatory support after birth. Arterial hypertension
  developed in all patients. Liver function was affected in 12 (92%) patients and
  was the predominant clinical concern in 2 of them. Two (15%) patients presented
  with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Portal hypertension was found in 7 (54%) patients.
  Initial sonography revealed enlarged kidneys in 12 (92%) patients, hyperechoic kidneys
  or poor cortico-medullary differentiation in 10 (77%), and liver abnormalities in
  5 (38%) patients. Unilateral nephrectomy was necessary before dialysis in 1 patient.
  Six (46%) patients started maintenance dialysis at an average age of 15.3 years.
  Kidney transplantation was performed in 2 (15%) and liver transplantation in 1 (8%)
  patient. Two (15%) patients died because of sepsis or respiratory failure. CONCLUSION:
  ARPKD is a progressive disease leading to ESRD and renal replacement treatment in
  almost half of our patients. Our data confirm the phenotypic variability of ARPKD
  in Slovenian patients."
