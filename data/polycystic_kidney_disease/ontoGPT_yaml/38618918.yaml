input_text: 'Investigational agents for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease:
  preclinical and early phase study insights. INTRODUCTION: Autosomal Dominant Polycystic
  Kidney Disease (ADPKD) is the most common inherited kidney condition caused by a
  single gene mutation. It leads patients to kidney failure in more than 50% of cases
  by the age of 60, and, given the dominant inheritance, this disease is present in
  the family history in more than 90% of cases. AREAS COVERED: This review aims to
  analyze the set of preclinical and early phase studies to provide a general view
  of the current progress on ADPKD therapeutic options. Articles from PubMed and the
  current status of the trials listed in clinicaltrials.gov were examined for the
  review. EXPERT OPINION: Many potential therapeutic targets are currently under study
  for the treatment of ADPKD. A few drugs have reached the clinical phase, while many
  are currently still in the preclinical phase. Organoids could be a novel approach
  to the study of drugs in this phase. Other than pharmacological options, very important
  developing approaches are represented by gene therapy and the use of MiRNA inhibitors.'
