input_text: An Empirical Biomarker-Based Calculator for Cystic Index in a Model of
  Autosomal Recessive Polycystic Kidney Disease-The Nieto-Narayan Formula. Autosomal
  recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) is associated with progressive enlargement
  of the kidneys fuelled by the formation and expansion of fluid-filled cysts. The
  disease is congenital and children that do not succumb to it during the neonatal
  period will, by age 10 years, more often than not, require nephrectomy+renal replacement
  therapy for management of both pain and renal insufficiency. Since increasing cystic
  index (CI; percent of kidney occupied by cysts) drives both renal expansion and
  organ dysfunction, management of these patients, including decisions such as elective
  nephrectomy and prioritization on the transplant waitlist, could clearly benefit
  from serial determination of CI. So also, clinical trials in ARPKD evaluating the
  efficacy of novel drug candidates could benefit from serial determination of CI.
  Although ultrasound is currently the imaging modality of choice for diagnosis of
  ARPKD, its utilization for assessing disease progression is highly limited. Magnetic
  resonance imaging or computed tomography, although more reliable for determination
  of CI, are expensive, time-consuming and somewhat impractical in the pediatric population.
  Using a well-established mammalian model of ARPKD, we undertook a big data-like
  analysis of minimally- or non-invasive blood and urine biomarkers of renal injury/dysfunction
  to derive a family of equations for estimating CI. We then applied a signal averaging
  protocol to distill these equations to a single empirical formula for calculation
  of CI. Such a formula will eventually find use in identifying and monitoring patients
  at high risk for progressing to end-stage renal disease and aid in the conduct of
  clinical trials.
