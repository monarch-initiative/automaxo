input_text: 'Effects of very low carbohydrate ketogenic diets on skeletal health.
  PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Very low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (KD) therapy has been associated
  with skeletal demineralization in children with drug-resistant epilepsy, but the
  cause of this association is unclear. Recently, interest in the KD has grown owing
  to its potential benefits for other illnesses including cancer, type 2 diabetes,
  obesity, and polycystic kidney disease. Summaries of the best available evidence
  regarding effects of a KD on skeletal health are lacking. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent
  rodent studies found that a KD can harm the growing skeleton, which corroborates
  most but not all studies in pediatric patients. Proposed mechanisms include chronic
  metabolic acidosis and depressed osteoanabolic hormones. Relative to other weight-reducing
  diets, a weight-reducing KD for treatment of obesity and/or type 2 diabetes in adults
  has not been associated with adverse skeletal effects. By contrast, recent evidence
  suggests that adaptation to a eucaloric KD may impair bone remodeling in elite adult
  athletes. Discrepancies in the literature may relate to differences between study
  populations and in diet formulation. SUMMARY: Attention to skeletal health is warranted
  when using KD therapy given the uncertainty in the literature and suggestive harms
  in certain populations. Future research should focus on potential mechanisms of
  injury.'
