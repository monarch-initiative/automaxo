input_text: 'Overview of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease in the south
  of Spain. INTRODUCTION: Although autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is
  the most common hereditary kidney disease, available data tend to be limited to
  after initiation of renal replacement therapy. OBJECTIVE: To ascertain an overview
  of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease within the health area of Granada
  in southern Spain. MATERIAL AND METHODS: From January 2007 to December 2016, we
  collected clinical, family and demographic information about all patients with autosomal
  dominant polycystic kidney disease, irrespective of whether or not they were treated
  with RRT, in the Granada health area. The computer software SPSS 15.0 and GenoPro
  were used. RESULTS: 50.6% of the 1,107 diagnosed patients were men. 99.1% were Caucasian
  and 4-6 generations/family were studied. The geographical distribution was heterogeneous.
  There was no family history in 2.43%. The mean age of diagnosis was 34.0+-17.80
  years and the diagnosis was made after having offspring in 57.7% of cases. The main
  reason for diagnosis was family history (46.4%). The mean age of initiation of renal
  replacement therapy was 54.2+-11.05 years. 96.3% of the deceased had some degree
  of renal failure at the time of death. The mean age of death was 60.9+-14.10 years,
  the main cause of death being unknown in 33.5% of cases, followed by cardiovascular
  (27.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Cases and families were concentrated in certain geographical
  areas and a significant number of individuals were undiagnosed prior to cardiovascular
  death or diagnosed late after reproduction. Given that there is currently no curative
  treatment, the primary prevention strategy of preimplantation genetic diagnosis
  should play a leading role.'
