input_text: 'Intravascular Renal Denervation in Renal Dialysis Patients with Uncontrolled
  Hypertension: A Case Series of Four Patients. BACKGROUND Hypertension is a common
  complication of renal dialysis and is inadequately controlled in approximately one-third
  of patients. Intravascular renal denervation is an option to control sympathetic
  overdrive and decrease blood pressure. Four renal dialysis patients are presented
  with uncontrolled hypertension who were treated with intravascular renal denervation.
  CASE REPORT In a renal dialysis unit, patients were screened for therapy-resistant
  hypertension, which was defined as an outpatient blood pressure >160/100 mmHg and
  a blood pressure by interdialytic ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) >130/80
  mmHg. Four patients were identified with a mean ABPM of 175/95 mmHg. The four patients
  included a 24-year-old man with neurogenic bladder undergoing hemodialysis; a 55-year-old
  woman with a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus undergoing peritoneal dialysis;
  a 56-year-old woman with a history of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease
  (ADPKD) undergoing peritoneal dialysis; and a 72-year-old man with a history of
  ADPKD undergoing hemodialysis Following intravascular renal denervation, one patient
  had antihypertensive medicines withdrawn at 12 months, and he remained normotensive
  up to renal transplantation at 24 months. In two patients, ABPM did not decrease
  until renal transplantation was performed. The fourth patient was not a candidate
  for renal transplantation, and he was also a non-responder for intravascular renal
  denervation. None of the patients experienced hypotension or other adverse events
  following intravascular renal denervation. CONCLUSIONS A case series of four patients
  showed that, for some patients who have unresponsive hypertension while on renal
  dialysis, intravascular renal denervation is a safe procedure.'
