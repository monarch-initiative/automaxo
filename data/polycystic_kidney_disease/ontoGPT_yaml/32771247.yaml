input_text: 'ABO-Incompatible Living Donor Kidney Transplantation in a Human Immunodeficiency
  Virus-Positive Recipient From a Human Immunodeficiency Virus-Positive Donor: A Case
  Report. A human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is no longer an absolute
  contraindication for solid organ transplantation, yet such a setting is still challenging
  and little explored because of general reservations and medical difficulties. We
  describe a 51-year-old man with end-stage renal failure due to polycystic kidney
  disease who underwent an ABO-incompatible kidney transplantation from his 49-year-old
  male partner. Early postoperative course revealed an episode of suspected acute
  rejection, which was successfully managed with a steroid pulse. Both donor and recipient
  continued to have an undetectable viral load after adjusting antiretroviral medication
  to renal function. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a successful
  ABO-incompatible living donor kidney transplantation from an HIV-positive donor
  in an HIV-positive recipient, and this case seems to be a valuable approach with
  favorable results.'
