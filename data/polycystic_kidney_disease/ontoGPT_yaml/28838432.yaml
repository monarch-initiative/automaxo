input_text: 'Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease Transplant Recipients After
  Kidney Transplantation: A Single-center Experience. Kidney transplantation is indicated
  for end-stage renal disease. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD)
  causes structural degeneration of the kidney and eventually becomes end-stage renal
  disease. ADPKD patients usually have several renal and nonrenal complications. We
  analyzed our kidney transplantation activities between 1991 and 2010 regarding ADPKD.
  We followed up with patients to December 31, 2016. Data were collected as patient
  and graft survival rates, the prevalence of polycystic manifestation of the gastrointestinal
  tract and other organs, and the attendance of urinary tract infection. Among the
  734 kidney transplantations, 10.9% (n = 80) had an ADPKD. Four patients (5%) had
  diverticulum perforation. The prevalence of post-transplantation urinary tract infection
  was higher in ADPKD patients (55.9%) compared to non-ADPKD patients (44.1%). The
  1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates in ADPKD recipients versus non-ADPKD patients
  are 77.5%, 70.0%, and 67.5% versus 86.4%, 83.0%, and 80.1%, respectively. Patients
  with ADPKD were transplanted at an elder age compared to others (median: 47.5 years
  vs. 39.9 years). Female patients had longer graft survival times than males. ADPKD
  implies multiple cystic degeneration of the kidneys; however, it can cause structural
  degeneration in other organs. It is typical for ADPKD patients to have an acute
  abdominal-like syndrome. Immunosuppressive drugs can hide the clinical picture,
  which makes early diagnosis difficult.'
