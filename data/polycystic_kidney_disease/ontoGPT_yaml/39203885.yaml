input_text: 'Compliance with a Healthful Plant-Based Diet Is Associated with Kidney
  Function in Patients with Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease. Autosomal
  dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a genetic kidney disorder with multiple
  cyst formation that progresses to chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage kidney
  disease. Plant-based diets have attracted considerable attention because they may
  prevent CKD development. This study investigated whether adherence to a plant-based
  diet is associated with kidney function in patients with ADPKD. The overall plant-based
  diet index (PDI), healthful PDI (hPDI), and unhealthful PDI (uPDI) were calculated
  using dietary intake data. Among 106 ADPKD patients, 37 (34.91%) were classified
  as having advanced CKD (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2). The overall PDI and hPDI were
  lower, but the uPDI was higher in patients with advanced CKD than in those with
  early CKD. The hPDI was negatively correlated with the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte
  ratio and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio. Moreover, the hPDI was inversely associated
  with advanced CKD [odds ratio (OR): 0.117 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.039-0.351),
  p < 0.001], and the uPDI was positively associated with advanced CKD [OR: 8.450
  (95% CI: 2.810-25.409), p < 0.001]. The findings of the current study demonstrate
  that greater adherence to a healthful plant-based diet is associated with improved
  kidney function in ADPKD patients.'
