input_text: 'Barriers and facilitators to the transplant process among patients living
  with polycystic kidney disease: a qualitative Approach. BACKGROUND: Kidney transplant
  is the gold standard for renal replacement therapy in patients with autosomal dominant
  polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), which is the fourth leading cause of kidney failure.
  Despite the medical and economic benefits of preemptive kidney transplant over dialysis
  before transplant, only 9-21% of qualifying patients receive preemptive transplants.
  Given the low rates of preemptive transplant, the aim of this study was to determine
  perceived facilitators and barriers to preemptive transplant among ADPKD patients
  using a qualitative approach. METHODS: Data were collected between July 2021 and
  January 2022 from virtual individual semi-structured interviews of 16 adult participants
  with ADPKD. Qualitative analysis of the recorded interviews was conducted to generate
  themes. RESULTS: Our findings revealed two themes specific for facilitators to preemptive
  transplant (social support and patient agency) and three themes specific to barriers
  for preemptive transplant (inadequate social support, gaps in knowledge, and institutional
  and systemic policies). The results also include various subthemes and the application
  of these themes to the social ecological model. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest
  that increasing social support and patient agency, such as through patient navigator
  programs and encouraging effective communication between health care providers and
  patients, can facilitate the transplant process. Increasing dissemination of transplant
  knowledge from institutions and systems to patients through paired kidney exchange
  education and live donor outreach can also increase timely access to preemptive
  kidney transplants for patients with ADPKD. Our findings are limited by our single
  site study in the US, which may not apply to individuals experiencing different
  social, cultural, and health access conditions.'
