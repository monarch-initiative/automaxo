input_text: 'Laparoscopic Nephrectomy versus Open Nephrectomy for Patients with Autosomal
  Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. OBJECTIVE:
  To compare efficacy and safety of laparoscopicnephrectomy (LN) versus open nephrectomy
  (ON) in the management of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD),
  we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: A systematic search
  of the electronic databases PubMed, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library was performed
  up to October 2014. This systematic review was performed based on observational
  comparative studies that assessed the two techniques. The weighted mean difference
  (WMD) and risk ratio (RR), with their corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI),
  were calculated to compare continuous and dichotomous variables, respectively. RESULTS:
  Seven studies were identified, including 195 cases (118 LN/77 ON). Although LN was
  associated with longer operative time (WMD 30.236, 95%CI 14.541 -45.932, P<0.001)
  and the specimen might not have been resected as heavy as the ON group (WMD -986.516,
  95%CI -1883.24--89.795, P = 0.031), patients in this group might benefit from a
  shorter length of hospital stay (WMD -3.576, 95%CI 4.976--2.176, P <0.001), less
  estimated blood loss (WMD -180.245, 95%CI -317.939--42.556, P = 0.010), and lower
  need of transfusion (RR 0.345, 95%CI 0.183-0.650, P = 0.001). The LN group also
  had less overall complications (RR 0.545, 95%CI 0.329-0.903, P = 0.018). The need
  of narcotic analgesics between the two groups might have no significant difference
  (WMD -54.66, 95%CI -129.76-20.44, P = 0.154). CONCLUSION: LN for giant symptomatic
  ADPKD was feasible, safe and efficacious. Morbidity was significantly reduced compared
  with the open approach. For an experienced laparoscopist, LN might be a better alternative.'
