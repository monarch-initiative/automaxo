input_text: Renal angiomyolipoma bleeding in a patient with TSC2/PKD1 contiguous gene
  syndrome after 17 years of renal replacement therapy. We report the case of a 32-year-old
  male diagnosed with TSC2/PKD1 contiguous gene syndrome, presenting with tuberous
  sclerosis (TS) and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease simultaneously.
  He progressed to end-stage renal disease and received a kidney transplant at the
  age of 12. The native kidneys presented angiomyolipomas (AML), which are common
  benign tumours in patients with TS. Seventeen years after transplantation, he presented
  with abdominal pain, anaemia and a retroperitoneal haematoma, the latter caused
  by renal AML bleeding. Selective embolisation was performed. Our patient could have
  benefited from the administration of mTOR inhibitors at transplant. This therapy
  is immunosuppressive and reduces the size of benign tumours in TS as well as the
  risk of rupture and bleeding. This patient did not receive mTOR inhibitors at the
  time of the transplant because the relationship between mTOR inhibitors and TS was
  unknown at that time. This case confirms the persistent risk of renal AML bleeding
  for both transplanted patients and patients on dialysis. As a result, we would recommend
  routine check-ups of native kidneys and nephrectomy assessment.
