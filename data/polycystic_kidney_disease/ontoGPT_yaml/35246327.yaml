input_text: 'Early Referral, Living Donation, and Preemptive Kidney Transplant. BACKGROUND:
  Preemptive kidney transplant (PKT) is recognized as the most beneficial and cost-effective
  form of renal replacement therapy among patients with end-stage renal disease. Despite
  optimal outcomes and improved quality of life associated with PKT, its use as a
  first renal replacement therapy remains low among patients with end-stage renal
  disease. The goal of this retrospective cohort study was to compare, among adult
  kidney transplant recipients, characteristics across PKT status. METHODS: We compared
  the characteristics of patients who did and did not have a PKT over 5 years, from
  2010 to 2014, using the electronic health records of Kaiser Permanente Mid-Atlantic
  States. RESULTS: A total of 233 patients received a kidney-alone transplant, and,
  of these, 44 patients (19%) were PKT and 189 patients (81%) were non-PKT. Of the
  patients in the PKT group, 43% received a kidney from a deceased donor. PKT recipients
  were more often White, had polycystic kidney disease or glomerulonephritis, received
  a living donor organ, and were transplanted at certain transplant centers. Estimated
  glomerular filtration rate on listing for those who received a deceased donor transplant
  was higher in PKT than non-PKT patients listed pre-dialysis. CONCLUSIONS: PKT was
  associated with having a living kidney donor and with having a higher estimated
  glomerular filtration rate at listing for deceased donor recipients.'
