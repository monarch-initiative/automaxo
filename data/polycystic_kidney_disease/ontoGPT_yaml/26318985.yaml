input_text: 'Native Nephrectomy with Renal Transplantation is Associated with a Decrease
  in Hypertension Medication Requirements for Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney
  Disease. PURPOSE: We assessed hypertensive control after native nephrectomy and
  renal transplantation in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.
  MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood pressure control was studied retrospectively in 118
  patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease who underwent renal transplantation
  between 2003 and 2013. Overall 54 patients underwent transplantation alone (group
  1) and 64 underwent transplantation with concurrent ipsilateral nephrectomy (group
  2). Of these 64 patients 32 underwent ipsilateral nephrectomy only (group 2a) and
  32 underwent eventual delayed contralateral native nephrectomy (group 2b). The number
  of antihypertensive drugs and defined daily dose of each antihypertensive was recorded
  at transplantation and up to 36-month followup. RESULTS: Comparing preoperative
  to postoperative medications at 12, 24 and 36-month followup, transplantation with
  concurrent ipsilateral nephrectomy had a greater decrease in quantity (-1.2 vs -0.5
  medications, p=0.008; -1.1 vs -0.3, p=0.007 and -1.2 vs -0.4, p=0.03, respectively)
  and defined daily dose of antihypertensive drug (-3.3 vs -1.0, p=0.0008; -2.9 vs
  -1.0, p=0.006 and -2.7 vs -0.6, p=0.007, respectively) than transplantation alone
  at each point. Native nephrectomy continued to be a predictor of hypertensive requirements
  on multivariable analysis (p <0.0001). The mean decrease in number of medications
  in group 2b from after ipsilateral nephrectomy to 12 months after contralateral
  nephrectomy was -0.6 (p=0.0005) and the mean decrease in defined daily dose was
  -0.6 (p=0.009). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney
  disease undergoing renal transplantation, concurrent ipsilateral native nephrectomy
  is associated with a significant decrease in the quantity and defined daily dose
  of antihypertensive drugs needed for hypertension control. Delayed contralateral
  native nephrectomy is associated with improved control of blood pressure to an even
  greater degree.'
