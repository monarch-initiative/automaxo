input_text: "Acute Cellular Rejection in A Kidney Transplant Recipient Following Vaccination
  with Inactivated SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine. SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are being administered
  worldwide. Most of the reported side effects are mild and self-limiting with few
  reported cases of severe adverse reactions. Here we report a case of acute cellular
  rejection in a kidney transplant recipient following vaccination with an inactivated
  SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. fifty- one years old man with autosomal dominant polycystic
  kidney disease, who had received a kidney transplantation from a living related
  donor, 3 years ago, presented with an impaired kidney function seven days after
  receiving the first dose of Sinovac's COVID-19 vaccine. Kidney transplant biopsy
  revealed acute cellular rejection. The allograft function completely recovered after
  treatment with steroids. The analysis and investigation of the complications and
  adverse reactions induced by anti-COVID-19 vaccines, could increase our understanding
  of the underlying pathogenesis.  DOI: 10.52547/ijkd.6915."
