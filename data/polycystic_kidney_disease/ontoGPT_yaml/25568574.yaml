input_text: "Exhausting multiple hemodialysis access failures. INTRODUCTION: Vascular
  access is often considered the Achilles heel the of hemodialysis because of its
  impact on morbidity, all cause mortality and finally costs of these patients. The
  most common complication of permanent hemodialysis (HD) vascular access is thrombosis,
  with some cases being related to hypercoagulability states. Antiphospholipid antibody
  syndrome (APAS) is a cause of increased thrombotic tendency, and this may complicate
  the management of such patients on HD. CASE REPORT: We describe a 41-year-old woman
  with end stage renal disease (ESRD) from Adult Polycystic Kidney Disease who was
  referred to our tertiary care center for treatment and selection of renal replacement
  therapy form. It was thought to initiate with peritoneal dialysis considering her
  actual conditions. She was putted on hemodialysis for several sessions, and a subclavian
  cathether was her first vascular access. The surgeon created an arterio-venous fistula
  which did not mature. After the implantation of the peritoneal cathether she started
  peritoneal dialysis and continued living with that for 2 years. She felt exhausted
  and because of a grave peritonitis episode accompanied with procedure failure and
  a long hospitalization she was transferred to hemodialysis. Renal transplantation
  was not possible because she didn't have a kidney donation. She was maintained on
  regular HD, but her dialysis care was complicated by recurrent vascular access failures.
  She had multiple interventions for arterio-venous fistulas and grafts but almost
  all of them failed due to thrombosis to the extent that only one access site was
  available for her routine renal replacement treatment. A thorough thrombophilia
  screen confirmed the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies. A diagnosis of APAS
  was made and she was anticoagulated with warfarin. The AVG made in this last available
  site is still working from 18 months. If it fails we have no answers and solutions
  for her. CONCLUSION: The presence of APAS can complicate HD management by causing
  recurrent vascular access thrombosis and failure, and nephrologist must remain alert
  to this possibility. Checking and treating as soon as possible it's our future challenge."
