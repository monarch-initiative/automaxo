input_text: "Laparoscopic pretransplant nephrectomy with morcellation in autosomic-dominant
  polycystic kidney disease patients with end-stage renal disease. BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic
  nephrectomy (LN) in end-stage autosomic-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD)
  requires a large abdominal incision for the specimen extraction. OBJECTIVE: The
  objective of this study was to describe our technique of LN for end-stage ADPKD
  followed by morcellation (LNM) of the specimen and extraction through a minimal
  abdominal incision. METHODS: The medical records of 19 consecutive patients who
  underwent pretransplant LNM between 2008 and 2011 by a single experienced laparoscopic
  surgeon were analyzed. Morcellation was performed with the Gynecare Morcellex  Tissue
  morcellator, Ethicon. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: All cases but one were completed
  laparoscopically. Mean specimen weight was 1,026.8 g. Mean duration of the procedure,
  estimated blood loss, and hospital stay were 131.3 min, 52.1 ml, and 7.9 days, respectively.
  Specimens were extracted through a 12-mm trocar in 10/18 patients and through a
  3-cm incision in 9/18 cases. Postoperatively, three complications were observed
  (Clavien grades II, I, and II). The only case of incisional hernia was observed
  in the converted procedure. Major limitation of the study is its retrospective design.
  CONCLUSIONS: In our preliminary series and in the hands of a very experienced laparoscopist,
  LNM for ADPKD appears as a modern, mini-invasive, and safe technique. Specimen's
  extraction through a small abdominal incision reduces postoperative pain and incisional
  hernias and guarantees the final cosmetic result of laparoscopy. The reduced overall
  morbidity could reduce the period between nephrectomy and transplantation."
