input_text: 'Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease: Study of clinical characteristics
  in an Indian population. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is
  the most common hereditary form of kidney disease. Clinical data on this multisystem
  disorder are scarce from developing countries. We conducted a prospective observational
  study of the clinical profile of ADPKD patients at a single center over a period
  of six years. A total of 208 patients were studied. Majority were male (60.6%) and
  the mean age was 45.8 +- 14.5 years. About 61.5% had early stage (Stages 1-3) of
  chronic kidney disease (CKD) and 38.5% had advanced CKD (Stages 4 and 5). Clinical
  features observed included pain abdomen (46.2%), nocturia (65.9%), hematuria (21.6%),
  nephrolithiasis (38.9%), urinary tract infection (UTI) (38.9%), hypertension (69.5%),
  and raised serum creatinine (54.3%). The prevalence of nocturia, hypertension, and
  renal dysfunction showed a significant increase with age (P = 0.001). Extrarenal
  manifestations were polycystic liver disease in 77 patients (37%), cysts in pancreas
  in two (1%), and stroke in three (1.5%) (hemorrhage in 2 and infarct in 1). There
  was significantly higher prevalence of hypertension (P = 0.027) and nephrolithiasis
  (P = 0.044) in males compared to females. Ninety-two patients (44.2%) had a positive
  family history for ADPKD. Fifteen (7.2%) had kidney failure at the diagnosis of
  ADPKD, were hospitalized, and underwent emergency dialysis. A total of 20 patients
  (9.6%) developed end-stage kidney disease during the study period. The age at diagnosis
  was higher, and there was a high prevalence of hypertension, nocturia, abdominal
  pain, nephrolithiasis, UTI, and renal dysfunction in Indian ADPKD patients.'
