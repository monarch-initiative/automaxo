input_text: 'Recurrent urinary tract infections in kidney transplant patients with
  polycystic kidneys. INTRODUCTION: Kidney transplantation is now a routine method
  used to treat end-stage renal disease. About 10 % of kidney transplant patients
  are patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). After successful
  kidney transplantation, recurrent urinary tract infections also occur in initially
  asymptomatic patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The group included 320 patients after
  kidney transplantation. We compared patients with ADPKD versus patients without
  ADPKD in terms of the presence of recurrent urinary tract infections. THE RESULTS:
  The incidence of recurrent urinary tract infections (rIMCs) was 18% in patients
  without ADPKD and 48% in patients without ADPKD. Nephrectomy after kidney transplantation
  due to recurrent urinary tract infections eliminated this infectious complication
  (in 86% of patients). CONCLUSION: Kidney transplant patients with ADPKD have a significantly
  higher incidence of recurrent urinary tract infections. Removal of polycystic kidneys
  is a suitable solution if the infection persists.'
