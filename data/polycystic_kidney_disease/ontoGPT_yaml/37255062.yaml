input_text: "Combined liver-kidney transplant in polycystic diseases: a case report.
  Polycystic liver disease, a hereditary pathology, usually manifests as autosomal
  dominant polycystic kidney disease. The many cysts in the liver cause massive hepatomegaly,
  majorly affecting the patient's quality of life. In cases of refractory symptoms,
  liver transplantation is the only treatment choice. A 43-year-old woman was followed
  up as a hepatology outpatient in August 2020, with a progressive increase in abdominal
  volume, lower limb edema, and cachexia. The patient was diagnosed with polycystic
  renal and liver disease with massive hepatomegaly in March 2021, a combined kidney-liver
  transplant. Liver size represented 13% of the patient's corporal composition, weighing
  8.6kg. The patient was discharged on the 7th postoperative day with no complications.
  Only 10-20% of patients with polycystic liver disease have clinical manifestations,
  most of which result from hepatomegaly. An increase in liver volume deteriorates
  liver function until the condition becomes end-stage liver disease, as kidney function
  is already compromised; liver-kidney transplantation remains the only treatment
  choice. The case described drew significant attention to the massive hepatomegaly
  presented in the patient, with the liver representing over 10% of the patient's
  body weight, approximately five to six times larger than a normal-sized liver."
