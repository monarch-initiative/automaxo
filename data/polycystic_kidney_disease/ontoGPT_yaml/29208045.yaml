input_text: "Joubert's syndrome and related disorders and home-based peritoneal dialysis
  in East Africa: a case report. BACKGROUND: Joubert's syndrome is a rare condition
  affecting an estimated 1:80,000-1:100,000 individuals. There is underdevelopment
  of the cerebellar vermis resulting in a characteristic molar tooth sign on cross
  sectional axial magnetic resonance imaging. It can occur in association with multi-organ
  involvement; in such cases it is classified as Joubert's syndrome and related disorders.
  To date, there are no cases of Joubert's syndrome and related disorders from sub-Saharan
  Africa described in the literature. CASE PRESENTATION: An 8 year old black Kenyan
  female child was diagnosed in Joubert's syndrome in her first year of life. She
  was noted to have dysmorphic facies and hypotonia in the neonatal period and cranial
  MRI showed dysplasia of the cerebellar vermis and typical molar tooth malformation.
  She was subsequently lost to follow up for several years and later presented with
  anaemia. Further investigation revealed bilateral multicystic kidneys and significant
  renal impairment consistent with a diagnosis of end stage renal failure and polycystic
  kidney disease. She underwent home peritoneal dialysis for 7 months. CONCLUSIONS:
  Joubert's syndrome and related disorders is a rare condition. This case report demonstrates
  that home peritoneal dialysis is feasible in a low resource setting. Although it
  is scarcely provided in African countries, it is an effective renal replacement
  strategy for patients with end stage renal disease."
