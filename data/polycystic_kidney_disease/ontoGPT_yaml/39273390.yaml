input_text: "Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate Signaling in Chronic Kidney Disease: Molecular
  Targets and Therapeutic Potentials. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is characterized
  by a steady decline in kidney function and affects roughly 10% of the world's population.
  This review focuses on the critical function of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)
  signaling in CKD, specifically how it influences both protective and pathogenic
  processes in the kidney. cAMP, a critical secondary messenger, controls a variety
  of cellular functions, including transcription, metabolism, mitochondrial homeostasis,
  cell proliferation, and apoptosis. Its compartmentalization inside cellular microdomains
  ensures accurate signaling. In kidney physiology, cAMP is required for hormone-regulated
  activities, particularly in the collecting duct, where it promotes water reabsorption
  through vasopressin signaling. Several illnesses, including Fabry disease, renal
  cell carcinoma, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, Bartter syndrome, Liddle syndrome,
  diabetic nephropathy, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, and renal tubular
  acidosis, have been linked to dysfunction in the cAMP system. Both cAMP analogs
  and phosphodiesterase inhibitors have the potential to improve kidney function and
  reduce kidney damage. Future research should focus on developing targeted PDE inhibitors
  for the treatment of CKD."
