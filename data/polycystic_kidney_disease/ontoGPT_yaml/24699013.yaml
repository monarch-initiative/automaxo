input_text: 'Safety and feasibility of dobutamine stress cardiac magnetic   resonance
  for cardiovascular assessment prior to   renal transplantation. AIMS: Current guidelines
  recommend cardiovascular risk assessment prior to renal transplantation. There is
  currently no evidence for the role of cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) in
  this population, despite an established evidence base in the non-chronic kidney
  disease (CKD) population. Our aim is to determine the feasibility and safety of
  dobutamine stress CMR (DSCMR) imaging in the risk stratification of CKD patients
  awaiting renal transplantation. METHODS: CKD patients who were deemed at high risk
  for coronary artery disease (CAD) and awaiting renal transplantation underwent DSCMR.
  RESULTS: Forty-one patients whose median age was 56 years (range 28-73 years) underwent
  DSCMR. Nineteen were undergoing haemodialysis, 10 peritoneal dialysis and 12 pre-dialysis.
  The aetiology of the renal failure was diabetes mellitus in 29%, glomerulonephritis
  in 24%, hypertension in 22% and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease in
  10%. Thirty-eight patients (93%) achieved the end point, either positive for ischaemia
  or negative, achieving at least 85% of age-predicted heart rate. Two of them did
  not achieve target heart rate and one was discontinued because of severe headache.
  Of the 38 patients who achieved the end point, 35 (92%) were negative for inducible
  wall motion abnormalities and four (10%) were positive. There were no serious adverse
  effects. CONCLUSION: DSCMR is a well tolerated and viable investigation for the
  cardiovascular risk stratification of high-risk CKD patients prior to renal transplantation.
  DSCMR already has an established evidence base in the non-CKD population with superiority
  over other noninvasive techniques. Larger studies with outcome data are now required
  to define its true utility in the CKD population.'
