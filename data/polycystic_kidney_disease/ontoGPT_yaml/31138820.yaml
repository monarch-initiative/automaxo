input_text: Clinical courses and complications of young adults with Autosomal Recessive
  Polycystic Kidney Disease (ARPKD). Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease
  (ARPKD) is a severe pediatric hepatorenal disorder with pronounced phenotypic variability.
  A substantial number of patients with early diagnosis reaches adulthood and some
  patients are not diagnosed until adulthood. Yet, clinical knowledge about adult
  ARPKD patients is scarce. Here, we describe forty-nine patients with longitudinal
  follow-up into young adulthood that were identified in the international ARPKD cohort
  study ARegPKD. Forty-five patients were evaluated in a cross-sectional analysis
  at a mean age of 21.4 (+-3.3) years describing hepatorenal findings. Renal function
  of native kidneys was within CKD stages 1 to 3 in more than 50% of the patients.
  Symptoms of hepatic involvement were frequently detected. Fourteen (31%) patients
  had undergone kidney transplantation and six patients (13%) had undergone liver
  transplantation or combined liver and kidney transplantation prior to the visit
  revealing a wide variability of clinical courses. Hepatorenal involvement and preceding
  complications in other organs were also evaluated in a time-to-event analysis. In
  summary, we characterize the broad clinical spectrum of young adult ARPKD patients.
  Importantly, many patients have a stable renal and hepatic situation in young adulthood.
  ARPKD should also be considered as a differential diagnosis in young adults with
  fibrocystic hepatorenal disease.
