input_text: "Simultaneous Hand-assisted Laparoscopic Bilateral Native Nephrectomy
  and Kidney Transplantation for Patients With Large Polycystic Kidneys. OBJECTIVE:
  To describe our technique of simultaneous hand-assisted laparoscopic bilateral native
  nephrectomy (BNN) and kidney transplantation (KT) in patients with autosomal dominant
  polycystic kidney disease and present our experience. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We
  retrospectively reviewed a cohort of adult ESRD patients with symptomatic autosomal
  dominant polycystic kidney disease who underwent a hand-assisted laparoscopic BNN
  at the time of KT. We reviewed patients' and donor characteristics, and perioperative
  and postoperative outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 52 patients underwent hand-assisted
  laparoscopic BNN at the time of KT from January 2014 to October 2019. The median
  age of the recipients was 53.4 years, 57.7% were males, and the median body mass
  index was 29.0 kg/m2. All but one received a kidney from a living donor and the
  majority (86.5%) were pre-emptive. One patient required a small bowel resection
  due to an intraoperative small bowel injury. There was no solid organ injury during
  the procedure. All patients showed immediate allograft function and a steady decline
  in serum creatinine. The median decline in the creatinine and hemoglobin on day
  1 was 1.2 mg/dL (inter quartile range 0.6-2.3) and 2.2 g/dL (inter quartile range
  1.4-3.0), respectively. CONCLUSION: Simultaneous hand-assisted laparoscopic bilateral
  nephrectomy with KT through a modified Gibson incision is feasible and safe in the
  hands of an experienced laparoscopic surgeon without compromising allograft function."
