input_text: 'Negative impact of underlying non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
  nephropathy on long-term allograft survival in kidney transplantation: a 10-year
  analysis from a single center. INTRODUCTION: We analyzed the relationship between
  underlying nephropathy and long-term outcomes in kidney transplant recipients. METHODS:
  We retrospectively analyzed data from 678 patients who underwent kidney transplantation
  (KTx) between 1998 and 2011. Recipients with 13 major nephropathies were evaluated
  for graft and patient survival, and causes of graft loss. RESULTS: The best 10-year
  graft survival rates (100%) were in the patients with autosomal-dominant polycystic
  kidney disease, preeclampsia, Alport syndrome, and purpura nephritis. The worst
  rate (50.8%) was in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus nephropathy
  (NIDDMN; P = .039). Causes of graft-loss in the NIDDM patients included chronic
  rejection (6 cases), acute rejection (3 cases), infection (2 cases), and cardiovascular
  event (2 cases). Significant risk factors for graft loss were donor age (P < .01)
  and NIDDMN (P < .01). CONCLUSION: Underlying NIDDMN before KTx was a significant
  risk factor for long-term graft function. Immunologic factors and nonimmunologic
  factors influenced the long-term outcomes in patients with underlying NIDDMN.'
