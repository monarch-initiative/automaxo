input_text: 'Glucose and Lipid Metabolism Abnormalities among Patients with Autosomal
  Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease. INTRODUCTION: Autosomal dominant polycystic
  kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most prevalent monogenic renal disease with a prevalence
  of 1:1,000 births and it is the 4th most common cause of dialysis-dependent end-stage
  renal disease (ESDR). Recent reports suggest an association between APDKD and metabolic
  derangements, particularly impaired glucose metabolism. METHODS: In this cross-sectional
  study we analyzed data obtained from case records of 189 patients with ADPKD, including
  kidney transplant recipients, managed in an outpatient department. RESULTS: The
  mean BMI was 25.4 +- 3.9; 25.25 before and 27.7 after transplan-tation. A fasting
  glucose level above 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) was observed in 60 patients (29%) - 27%
  without transplantation and 41% kidney transplant recipients. Diabetes mellitus
  was diagnosed in 17 patients (8.9%), including 3 (2.3%) without a history of transplantation
  and 14 (24.1%) after kidney transplantation (p < 0.01). We observed dyslipidemia
  in 30% and hyperuricemia in 53% of patients. CONCLUSION: Demonstrated metabolic
  abnormalities should be considered in maintenance of ADPKD patients, including kidney
  transplant recipients.'
