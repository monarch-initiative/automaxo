input_text: 'Caroli Disease Revisited: A Case of a Kidney Transplant Patient With
  Autosomal Polycystic Kidney Disease and Recurrent Episodes of Cholangitis. Polycystic
  kidney disease (PKD) is a genetic disorder leading to end-stage renal disease more
  commonly in the fourth to sixth decades of life. Cyst formation in the kidneys and
  other organs such as the liver and pancreas is the main characteristic of this disease.
  A significant number of patients with PKD undergo kidney transplantation and receive
  significant immunosuppression, predisposing them to comorbidities such as infections
  and malignancies. The link between these cystic syndromes and Caroli disease (which
  is radiologically demonstrated as bile duct ectasia, segmental cystic dilation of
  intrahepatic bile ducts, with a normal common bile duct and absence of hepatic fibrosis
  or portal hypertension), is extremely important. Suspicion, screening, and timely
  diagnosis of the presence of Caroli disease in patients with PKD prior or post receiving
  a kidney transplant will reduce morbidity in these patients and possibly prolong
  both graft and patient survival. We describe a patient with autosomal dominant polycystic
  kidney disease who underwent recurrent admissions for presumed cholangitis and was
  eventually diagnosed with Caroli disease.'
