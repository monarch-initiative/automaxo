input_text: 'Native nephrectomy in polycystic kidney disease patients on transplant
  lists: how and when? Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), the most
  common hereditary kidney disease, accounts for approximately 10% of the patients
  on kidney transplantation waitlists. High rates of complications including hemorrhage,
  infections, nephrolithiasis and kidney size-related compressive complaints have
  been reported among ADPKD patients. Therefore, the need for routine native nephrectomy
  and timing of such procedure in ADPKD patients being prepared for transplantation
  are debated. Even though pre-transplant nephrectomy has the potential to provide
  fewer infectious complications due to lack of immunosuppressive medication use,
  such procedure has been associated with longer hospital stay, loss of residual kidney
  function and need for dialysis. Although simultaneous nephrectomy and transplantation
  could potentially lead to longer perioperative duration, perioperative complications
  and need for blood transfusions, this was not confirmed in cohort studies. Therefore,
  some institutions routinely perform simultaneous unilateral nephrectomy and kidney
  transplantation. In this narrative review, our aim is to evaluate the current evidence
  regarding the need and timing of nephrectomy in ADPKD patients in relation to kidney
  transplantation.'
