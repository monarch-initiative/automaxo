input_text: 'Prevalence and outcomes of cystic lesions of the transplant pancreas:
  The University of Wisconsin Experience. Literature on the behavior of cystic lesions
  in pancreas transplants is scarce, and hence a better understanding is warranted.
  Data on recipients and their respective donors that underwent simultaneous kidney
  and pancreas, pancreas transplant alone, and pancreas after kidney between 1994
  and 2015 were reviewed (n = 1185). Cystic lesions of the transplant pancreas developed
  in 22 patients (1.8%): 12 pseudocysts, 2 cysts/remnants, 4 intraductal papillary
  mucinous neoplasms (IPMN), 2 adenocarcinomas, 1 low-grade intraepithelial pancreatic
  neoplasia, and 1 case of polycystic kidney disease. The median size was 3.6 cm (1.6-5.5
  cm), and occurred at a median time of 65.5 months (2-183 months) posttransplant.
  The median age of the graft at time of diagnosis was 42 years (25.7-54.5), with
  17 of 22 grafts (77%) functioning at time of diagnosis. Triggers for investigation
  were elevations in pancreatic enzymes, re-admissions for abdominal pain, and incidentalomas.
  High-resolution imaging and diagnostic biopsy/aspiration with ancillary tests were
  the main diagnostic tests. Most pseudocysts were managed by percutaneous drainage,
  and although no firm inference can be made from such a small series, we have observed
  that the behavior and management of IPMN and adenocarcinoma in the pancreas graft
  appears congruent to that of the native pancreas.'
