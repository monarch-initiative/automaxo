input_text: 'Intraperitoneal Pressure in Polycystic and Non-Polycystic Kidney Disease
  Patients, Treated by Peritoneal Dialysis. INTRODUCTION: Intraperitoneal volume (IPV)
  should be individualized and aimed to maintain an intraperitoneal pressure (IPP)
  lower than 17 cm H2O. IPP is very variable, given its relation with body size. However,
  it is not yet fully understood which anthropometric variable mostly affects IPP
  and the relation between IPP and organomegaly in polycystic kidney disease (PKD)
  patients is not known. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to analyse the
  relation between antropometric variables and IPP in a large cohort of peritoneal
  dialysis (PD) patients and to identify if a relation between nephromegaly and IPP
  exists in PKD patients. METHODS: IPP was measured in PD patients and data was retrospectively
  collected. In PKD patients, total kidney volumes were measured in CT scans, and
  normalized with height (hTKV). RESULTS: Seventy-seven patients were included in
  the study, 18% affected by PKD. Mean IPP was 14.9 +- 2.9 cm H2O and it showed significant
  positive correlation with body mass index (BMI; rho = 0.42, p < 0.001). No correlation
  was found between IPP and absolute IPV; conversely, IPP has a significant inverse
  correlation with IPV normalized with BMI and body surface area (rho -0.38, p = 0.001
  and rho -0.25, p = 0.02, -respectively). Patients with IPP >17 cm H2O have significant
  larger BMI and lower IPV/BMI compared to those with IPP <17 cm H2O (29 +- 3.6 vs.
  26 +- 4 kg/m2, p < 0.05 and 97 +- 15.5 vs. 109 +- 22 mL/kg/m2, p < 0.05). PKD patients
  have a wide variability in hTKV (range 645-3,787 mL/m2) and it showed a significant
  correlation with IPP/IPV (rho = 0.6, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with larger
  BMI have greater IPP, irrespectively to IPV. In PKD patients, hTKV correlate with
  IPP/IPV ratio. However, given the wide range of distribution of hTKV, increased
  IPP cannot be presumed because of pre-existing polycystic kidney, but need to be
  quantified.'
