input_text: 'Effect of Sirolimus on Native Total Kidney Volume After Transplantation
  in Patients with Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease: A Randomized Controlled
  Pilot Study. BACKGROUND: The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway has been
  shown to be central to cyst formation and growth in patients with autosomal dominant
  polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Drugs that suppress mTOR signaling are frequently
  used as antiproliferative agents for maintenance immunosuppression in patients who
  have undergone kidney transplantation. The aim of this study was to determine the
  effect of sirolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, on cyst volume regression in patients with
  ADPKD who have undergone renal transplantation. METHODS: In this single-center,
  prospective, open-label, parallel-group, randomized trial, 23 adult patients with
  ADPKD who successfully underwent renal transplantation from 2008 to 2012 were subsequently
  randomized (on a 1:1 basis) to a maintenance immunosuppression regimen with either
  sirolimus (sirolimus, tacrolimus, prednisone) or mycophenolate (mycophenolate, tacrolimus,
  prednisone). Total kidney volumes were measured by means of high-resolution magnetic
  resonance imaging within 2 weeks after transplantation and at 1 year. The primary
  end point was change in total kidney volume at 1 year. RESULTS: Sixteen patients
  completed the 1-year study (8 patients in each group). There was a decrease in kidney
  volume in both the sirolimus group (percentage change from baseline, 20.5%; P <
  .001) and mycophenolate group (percentage change from baseline, 17%; P = .048),
  but there was no significant difference in percentage change of total kidney volume
  between the groups (P = .665). CONCLUSIONS: In ADPKD patients at 1 year after kidney
  transplantation, there was a similar decrease in polycystic kidney volume in patients
  receiving an immunosuppression regimen containing sirolimus compared with patients
  receiving mycophenolate.'
