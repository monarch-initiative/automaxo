input_text: '[Acquired cystic kidney hemorrhage in peritoneal dialysis patients: A
  report of three cases]. Spontaneous renal cyst hemorrhage is one of the clinical
  emergencies in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients and is potentially life-threatening.
  The main complaints are sudden low back pain, paleness, and hypotensive shock with
  or without vomiting or fever. In contrast to inherited polycystic kidney disease,
  acquired cystic kidney disease (ACKD) secondary to chronic kidney disease is easily
  overlooked or delayed in clinical diagnosis and treatment, leading to severe clinical
  outcomes. We report three patients with spontaneous hemorrhage of ACKD in the peritoneal
  dialysis center at Peking University First Hospital. The common features are as
  follows, long history of dialysis, mild to severe low back pain, decrease in hemoglobulin,
  negative PD solutions, diagnosis established through computed tomography (CT), and
  continuing PD during treatment of ACKD hemorrhage. Treatments vary from conservative
  to unilaterally selective renal artery embolization. In this study, ACKD morbidity
  was investigated in PD patients. A total of 316 patients who had an abdominal ultrasound,
  CT, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the past 1 year were enrolled. Among
  them, 103 cases (32.9%) met the diagnostic criteria of ACKD. The morbidity rates
  were 27.5%, 37.8%, 43.8%, 59.1%, and 88.6%, when the dialysis history ranged from
  <=3, >3 & <=5, >5 & <=7, >7 & <=9, >9 years, respectively, showing a increasing
  trend. Most ACKD hemorrhages could be healed and got an acceptable prognosis after
  treatment, including rest, blood transfusion, selective renal artery embolization,
  or nephrectomy. We summarize the risk factors, including a long history of dialysis,
  anticoagulation or antiplatelet, and inflammation or stones of the urinary system,
  but with no difference in initial kidney diseases and gender. ACKD hemorrhage mainly
  includes intracapsular hemorrhage, cyst rupture, and spontaneous retroperitoneal
  hemorrhage. In addition, we also recommend an adaptive process for spontaneous kidney
  hemorrhage of diagnosis and treatment in peritoneal dialysis patients. The significance
  of these cases lies in the fact that patients with ACKD are potentially associated
  with complications such as cyst hemorrhage and malignancy. Thus, peritoneal dialysis
  physicians should place great importance on the surveillance of ACKD.'
