input_text: 'Efficacy of 4 Years of Octreotide Long-Acting Release Therapy in Patients
  With Severe Polycystic Liver Disease. OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect on total
  liver volume (TLV) on and off therapy in selected symptomatic patients with autosomal
  dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) or autosomal dominant polycystic liver
  disease (PLD) who received octreotide long-acting release (OctLAR) for up to 4 years.
  PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-eight of 42 participants in a prospective 2-year clinical
  trial of OctLAR (40 mg monthly) consisting of double-blind, randomized (year 1)
  and open-label treatment (year 2) phases reenrolled in a 2-year open-label extension
  (OLE) study after being off OctLAR a mean of 8.3 months (original study: July 1,
  2007, through June 30, 2013). Participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging
  at baseline, years 1 and 2, reenrollment, and study completion. Primary end point:
  change in TLV; secondary end points: changes in total kidney volume, glomerular
  filtration rate, quality of life (QoL), safety, vital signs, and laboratory parameters.
  RESULTS: Twenty-five participants (59.5%) completed the OLE. Off therapy, TLVs increased
  a mean +- SD of 3.4%+-8.2% per year; after resuming therapy, TLVs decreased a mean
  +- SD of -4.7%+-6.1% per year. Despite regrowth off treatment, overall reductions
  were observed, with a median (interquartile range) TLV of 4047 mL (3107-7402 mL)
  at baseline and 3477 (2653-7131 mL) at study completion (-13.2%; P<.001) and with
  improved health-related QoL. Total kidney volumes increased, and glomerular filtration
  rates declined from 58.2 mL/min to 54.5 mL/min (n=16) in patients with ADPKD on
  therapy from baseline to study completion. CONCLUSION: Therapy with OctLAR over
  4 years in selected patients with symptomatic PLD arrested PLD progression, alleviating
  symptoms and improving health-related QoL. Discontinuation led to organ regrowth.
