input_text: 'Allogeneic Kidney Transplantation After COVID-19: A Case Report. BACKGROUND:
  Patients undergoing organ transplantation are immunosuppressed and already at risk
  of various diseases. We report about a patient who underwent ABO-incompatible kidney
  transplantation after coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) without a recurrence of
  infection. CASE REPORT: A 68-year-old woman presented with end-stage renal failure
  owing to primary autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease; accordingly, hemodialysis
  was initiated in September 2020. Her medical history included bilateral osteoarthritis,
  lumbar spinal stenosis, hypertension, and hyperuricemia. In mid-January 2021, she
  contracted severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection from her husband.
  Both of them were hospitalized and received conservative treatment. Because their
  symptoms were mild, they were discharged after 10 days. The patient subsequently
  underwent ABO-incompatible kidney transplantation from her husband who recovered
  from COVID-19 in March 2021. Before kidney transplantation, her COVID-19 polymerase
  chain reaction test was negative, confirming the absence of pre-existing COVID-19
  immediately before the procedure. Computed tomography revealed no pneumonia. Initial
  immunosuppression was induced by administering tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil,
  methylprednisolone, basiliximab, rituximab, and 30 g of intravenous immunoglobulin.
  Double-filtration plasmapheresis and plasma exchange were performed once before
  ABO-incompatible kidney transplantation. The renal allograft functioned immediately,
  and the postoperative course was normal without rejection. COVID-19 did not recur.
  In addition, her serum creatinine levels and renal function had otherwise remained
  stable. CONCLUSION: Living kidney transplantation was safely performed in a patient
  with COVID-19 without postoperative complications or rejection. During the COVID-19
  pandemic, the possibility of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection
  during transplantation surgery must be considered.'
