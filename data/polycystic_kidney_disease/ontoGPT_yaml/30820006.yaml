input_text: 'Genotype-Clinical Correlations in Polycystic Kidney Disease with No Apparent
  Family History. BACKGROUND: Genetic characteristics of polycystic kidney disease
  (PKD) patients without apparent family history were reported to be different from
  those with a positive family history. However, the clinical course of PKD patients
  with no apparent family history is not well documented in the literature. METHODS:
  We evaluated the relationship between genotype and the clinical course of 62 PKD
  patients with no apparent family history. RESULTS: The annual decline of renal function
  was faster in the patients with PKD1/PKD2 mutation (PKD1 truncating [-3.08; 95%
  CI -5.30 to -0.87, p = 0.007], PKD1 nontruncating [-2.10; -3.82 to -0.38, p = 0.02],
  and PKD2 [-2.31; -4.40 to -0.23, p = 0.03]) than in the other patients without PKD1/PKD2
  mutation. Similar results were obtained after adjustment for gender, age, estimated
  glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), height-adjusted total kidney volume (TKV), and
  mean arterial pressure (MAP). There was no significant difference in the annual
  decline of renal function among the different PKD1/PKD2 groups, but Kaplan-Meier
  analysis showed that progression to eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 was significantly faster
  in PKD1 truncating group (p = 0.05). The annual rate of TKV increase was larger
  in the patients with PKD1/PKD2 mutation (PKD1 truncating [4.63; 95% CI 0.62-8.64,
  p = 0.03], PKD1 nontruncating [3.79; 0.55-7.03, p = 0.02], and PKD2 [2.11; -1.90
  to 6.12, p = 0.29]) than in the other patients without PKD1/PKD2 mutation. Similar
  results were obtained after adjustment for gender, age, eGFR, and MAP. CONCLUSION:
  Detection of PKD1/PKD2 mutation, especially PKD1 truncating, is useful for predicting
  the renal outcome and rate of TKV increase in PKD patients with no apparent family
  history.'
