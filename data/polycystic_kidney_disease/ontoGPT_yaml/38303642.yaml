input_text: Survival of Infants With Severe Congenital Kidney Disease After ECMO and
  Kidney Support Therapy. Congenital kidney failure not only affects the homeostatic
  functions of the kidney, but also affects neonatal respiratory integrity. Until
  recently, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support was not used in this
  population because the need for ECMO clearly established nonviability. Since 2016,
  31 neonates have been admitted to the NICU at Children's of Alabama with congenital
  kidney failure. Five patients were placed on ECMO for severe respiratory distress
  unresponsive to conventional interventions. We evaluated neonates with congenital
  kidney failure and pulmonary hypoplasia/hypertension refractory to conventional
  therapies who received ECMO support within the first 9 postnatal days. We describe
  the pre and postnatal diagnoses, ECMO course details, dialysis modalities, complications,
  procedures, and long-term outcomes of these patients. All 5 patients received kidney
  support therapy by postnatal day 7. Diagnoses included posterior urethral valves,
  bilateral renal dysplasia, and autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease. Gestational
  age ranged from 35.6 to 37.1 weeks. Birth weight ranged from 2740 to 3140 g. Days
  on ECMO ranged from 4 to 23. Four survived and are living today. Pulmonary hypertension
  resolved in surviving patients. Three surviving patients require no oxygen support,
  and 1 patient requires nocturnal oxygen. Three survivors received a kidney transplant,
  and 1 awaits transplant evaluation. Patients with congenital kidney failure with
  severe pulmonary hypoplasia/pulmonary hypertension no longer warrant a reflexive
  assignment of nonviability. Meticulous ECMO, respiratory, nutritional, and kidney
  support therapies may achieve a favorable long-term outcome. Further investigation
  of strategies for optimal outcome is needed.
