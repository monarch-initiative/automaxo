input_text: "Gender-specific differences in hemodialysis patients: a multicenter longitudinal
  study from Serbia. PURPOSE: The study was undertaken with the aim to determine gender-specific
  differences in incident hemodialysis (HD) patient and their changes over time. METHODS:
  The retrospective longitudinal closed cohort study involved 441 incident patients
  starting HD in 2014 and followed for 1-59 (median 43, IQR 40) months. Demographic,
  clinical data, treatment characteristics, laboratory findings and outcome were abstracted
  from the patients' medical records. RESULTS: The relative number of males on HD
  was about twice that of females throughout the five years investigated. At the beginning
  of the study, no significant differences were found in the main demographic and
  clinical characteristics except that diabetes was more often the underlying disease
  in men than in women. Systolic blood pressure decreased over time significantly
  more in females than in males. Throughout the study spKt/V was significantly higher
  in females than in males, but it increased in patients of both genders. There were
  no gender differences for comorbidities, vascular access and the majority of laboratory
  findings except for higher serum levels of creatinine and CRP in men than in women.
  Relatively more females were treated with erythropoiesis stimulating agents and
  phosphate binders than males. Age and malignancy were selected as significant predictors
  of mortality for both genders, and, in addition, polycystic kidney disease, serum
  level of albumin and CRP for men, but spKt/V for women. CONCLUSION: Some significant
  gender differences were observed throughout, while others appeared during the study
  but none of them were due to gender inequalities in the applied treatment."
