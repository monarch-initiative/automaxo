input_text: 'Is Peritoneal Dialysis a Suitable Renal Replacement Therapy Option for
  Polycystic Kidney Disease Patients? BACKGROUND/AIMS: Mounting clinical experience
  and evidence from scale observational studies have suggested that polycystic kidney
  disease (PKD) was not a contraindication for peritoneal dialysis (PD). Recent studies
  have reported that PD may be associated with a better prognosis in PKD than that
  of non-PKD patients. To solve the problem, we performed a systematic review and
  comprehensive meta-analysis to compare the outcomes between PKD and non-PKD patients
  on PD and the all-cause mortality between patients with PKD on PD and hemodialysis
  (HD). METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature using electronic databases (PubMed,
  Ovid, Embase and Web of Science) to identify the studies reporting the endpoint
  events of PKD/non-PKD patients with PD and the all-cause mortality between patients
  with PKD on PD and HD, such as dialysis adequacy, technique failure, PD-related
  complications, the mode of RRT change, and all-cause mortality. We searched the
  literature published February 2018 or earlier. We used both fix-effects and random-effects
  models to calculate the overall effect estimate. A sensitivity analysis and subgroup
  analysis were performed to find the origin of heterogeneity. RESULTS: 12 studies
  with a total of 17,040 patients reported the endpoint events of PKD/non-PKD patients
  with PD. No significant difference was observed on dialysis adequacy (Kt/V, SMD:
  -0.02, 95%CI: -0.12-0.08; D: Pcr (4h), SMD: -0.10, 95% CI: -0.26-0.06), technique
  failure (RR: 0.97, 95%CI: 0.78-1.20), RRT change (RR: 0.96, 95%CI: 0.77-1.19), total
  PD-associated complications (RR: 1.0, 95%CI: 0.91-1.09) and all-cause mortality
  (RR: 0.40, 95%CI: 0.33-0.47) in PKD patients, compared with non-PKD subjects undergoing
  PD. However, the proportion of renal transplantation in PKD patients was higher
  than that of non-PKD patients (RR: 2.04, 95%CI: 1.88-2.20) with significant heterogeneity
  (I2 =82.7%, P=0.000). 4 studies with a total of 5,762 patients reported that the
  all-cause mortality did not differ between the PKD patients on PD and HD (RR: 0.87,
  95%CI: 0.72-1.06). CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis found that the outcomes of given
  population of PKD patients on PD were at least not inferior as compared to those
  with other primary kidney diseases, and suggested that PKD might be not absolutely
  a contraindication for PD. Given the limitations of the proposed, it needs further
  large-scale studies to assess whether PD is a suitable RRT option for end-stage
  renal disease (ESRD) patients with PKD.'
