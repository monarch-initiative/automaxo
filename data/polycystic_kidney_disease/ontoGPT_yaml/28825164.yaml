input_text: 'The mutation-free embryo for in vitro fertilization selected by MALBAC-PGD
  resulted in a healthy live birth from a family carrying PKD 1 mutation. BACKGROUND:
  Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD, autosomal dominant PKD or adult-onset
  PKD) is the most prevalent and potentially lethal kidney disease that is hereditary
  and lacks effective treatment. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) of embryos
  in assistant reproductive technology (ART) helps to select mutation-free embryos
  for blocking ADPKD inheritance from the parents to their offspring. However, there
  are multiple pseudogenes in the PKD1 coding region, which make blocking ADPKD inheritance
  by PGD complicated and difficult. Therefore, this technique has not been recommended
  and used routinely to ADPKD family plan. METHODS AND RESULTS: Here, we report a
  new strategy of performing PGD in screening (target-) mutation-free embryos. We
  firstly used a long-range PCR amplification and next generation sequencing to identify
  the potential PKD1 mutant(s). After pathogenic variants were detected, multiple
  annealing and looping-based amplification cycles (MALBAC), a recently developed
  whole genome amplification method, was used to screen embryo cells. We successfully
  distinguished the mutated allele among pseudogenes and obtained mutation-free embryos
  for implantation. The first embryo transfer attempt resulted in a healthy live birth
  free of ADPKD condition and chromosomal anomalies which was confirmed by aminocentesis
  at week 18 of gestation, and by performing live birth genetic screening. CONCLUSIONS:
  The first MALBAC-PGD attempt in ADPKD patient resulted in a healthy live birth free
  of ADPKD and chromosomal anomalies. MALBAC-PGD also enables selecting embryos without
  aneuploidy together and target gene mutation, thereby increasing implantation and
  live birth rates.'
