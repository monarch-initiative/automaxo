input_text: "Epidemiology of peritonitis following maintenance peritoneal dialysis
  catheter placement during infancy: a report of the SCOPE collaborative. BACKGROUND:
  Maintenance peritoneal dialysis (PD) is the dialysis modality of choice for infants
  and young children. However, there are limited outcome data for those who undergo
  PD catheter insertion and initiate maintenance PD within the first year of life.
  METHODS: Using data from the Children's Hospital Association's Standardizing Care
  to Improve Outcomes in Pediatric End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Collaborative (SCOPE),
  we examined peritonitis rates and patient survival in 156 infants from 29 North
  American pediatric dialysis centers who had a chronic PD catheter placed prior to
  their first birthday. RESULTS: In-hospital and overall annualized rates of peritonitis
  were 1.73 and 0.76 episodes per patient-year, respectively. Polycystic kidney disease
  was the most frequent renal diagnosis and pulmonary hypoplasia the most common co-morbidity
  in infants with peritonitis. Multivariable regression models demonstrated that nephrectomy
  at or prior to PD catheter placement and G-tube insertion after catheter placement
  were associated with a nearly sixfold and nearly threefold increased risk of peritonitis,
  respectively. Infants with peritonitis had longer initial hospital stays and lower
  overall survival (86.3 vs. 95.6%, respectively; P < 0.02) than those without an
  episode of peritonitis. CONCLUSIONS: In this large cohort of infants with ESRD,
  the frequency of peritonitis was high and several risk factors associated with the
  development of peritonitis were identified. Given that peritonitis was associated
  with a longer duration of initial hospitalization and increased mortality, increased
  attention to the potentially modifiable risk factors for infection is needed."
