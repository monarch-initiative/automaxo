input_text: 'A Large Database Analysis of Rates of Aneurysm Screening, Elective Treatment,
  and Subarachnoid Hemorrhage in Patients With Polycystic Kidney Disease. BACKGROUND:
  Professional societies provide conflicting guidelines on aneurysm screening in patients
  with polycystic kidney disease (PKD), and the rate of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)
  is poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate screening, elective treatment, and
  the rate of SAH in patients with known PKD. METHODS: We examined longitudinally
  linked claims data from a large private insurer, identifying screening, elective
  treatment, aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) and secured aneurysmal SAH
  (saSAH) in 2004 to 2014 amongst patients with known PKD. RESULTS: We identified
  20 704 patients diagnosed with PKD. Among patients with an initial PKD diagnosis,
  51/446 (15.9%) underwent angiographic screening within 2 yr. Forty aneurysms were
  treated electively in 48 868 yr at risk in PKD patients (82/100K patient yr, 95%
  confidence interval [CI] 60-112) vs 24 elective treatments in 349 861 yr at risk
  in age- and sex-matched controls (7/100K patient yr, 95% CI 5-10, P < .0001). Eleven
  admissions for aSAH were identified in PKD patients (23/100K patient yr, 95% CI
  13-41) and 22 admissions for aSAH in controls (6/100K patient yr, 95% CI 4-10),
  giving an incidence rate ratio (IRR) of 3.6 (95% CI 1.7-7.4, P < .0001) and a comorbidity-adjusted
  IRR of 3.1 (95% CI 1.4-6.9). The incidence of saSAH was proportionally even higher
  in PKD patients than controls, 16 vs 2/100K patient years, IRR 9.5 (95% CI 3.3-27.5,
  P < .0001). CONCLUSION: Screening in PKD is performed only selectively, though resulting
  rates of elective treatment were over 10x those of controls. Despite screening and
  treatment, the rate of SAH remains significantly elevated over that of controls.'
