input_text: Renal cystic diseases during the perinatal and neonatal period. Renal
  cystic diseases are a clinically and genetically diverse group of renal diseases
  that can manifest in utero, infancy, or throughout childhood and adulthood. These
  diseases may be unilateral or bilateral with a single cyst or multiple cysts, or
  with increased echogenicity of the renal cortex without macroscopic cysts. Certain
  cystic renal diseases are life-threatening, with many developing chronic kidney
  and hepatic disease if not recognized early enough. Therefore, due to the prevalence
  and life-altering complications of this specific group of diseases in vulnerable
  populations, it is crucial for clinicians and healthcare providers to have an overall
  understanding of cystic diseases and how to pre-emptively detect and manage these
  conditions. In this review, we discuss in detail the epidemiology, genetics and
  pathophysiology, diagnosis, presentation, and management of numerous genetic and
  sporadic renal cystic diseases, such as polycystic kidney disease, multicystic dysplastic
  kidney, and calyceal diverticula, with an emphasis on prenatal care and pregnancy
  counseling.
