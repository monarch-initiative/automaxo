input_text: 'The Need for Routine Native Nephrectomy in the Workup for Kidney Transplantation
  in Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease Patients. INTRODUCTION: There is
  no consensus if nor when a native nephrectomy should be performed in the workup
  for kidney transplantation in ADPKD patients. In our PKD Expertise Center, a restrictive
  approach is pursued in which nephrectomy is performed only in patients with severe
  complaints, i.e., in case of serious volume-related complaints, lack of space for
  the allograft, recurrent cyst infections, persistent cyst bleedings, or chronic
  refractory pain. We analyzed in a retrospective cohort study whether this approach
  is justified. METHODS: All ADPKD patients who received kidney transplantation between
  January 2000 and January 2019 were reviewed. Patients were subdivided into three
  groups: no nephrectomy (no-Nx), nephrectomy performed before (pre-Tx), or after
  kidney transplantation (post-Tx). Simultaneous nephrectomy together with transplantation
  were not performed in our center. RESULTS: 391 patients (54 +- 9 years, 55% male)
  were included. The majority of patients did not undergo a nephrectomy (n = 257,
  65.7%). A nephrectomy was performed pre-Tx in 114 patients (29.2%). After Tx, nephrectomy
  was performed in only 30 patients (7.7%, median 4.4 years post-Tx). Surgery-related
  complication rates did not differ between both groups (38.3% pre-Tx vs. 27.0% post-Tx,
  p = 0.2), nor were there any differences in 10-year patient survival (74.4% pre-Tx
  vs. 80.7% post-Tx vs. 67.6% no-Nx, p = 0.4), as well as in 10-year death-censored
  graft survival (84.4% pre-Tx vs. 85.5% post-Tx vs. 90.0% no-Nx, p = 0.9). CONCLUSIONS:
  This study indicates that with a restrictive nephrectomy policy in the workup for
  kidney transplantation, only a part of ADPKD patients need a native nephrectomy.'
