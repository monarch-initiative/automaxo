input_text: "[Lymphocytic leukopenia in two patients affected by polycystic kidney
  disease waiting for renal transplantation]. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney
  disease (ADPKD) is the most common hereditary kidney disease, responsible for 10%
  of patients on renal replacement therapy. The disease is well known to be associated
  with many extrarenal manifestations. Leukopenia may also be present, even if it
  is not commonly identified as a typical extrarenal manifestation. Herein we describe
  two case reports of ADPKD patients with leukopenia. The first case is about a 47-year-old
  patient affected by ADPKD, regularly treated with peritoneal dialysis, who showed
  a progressive reduction of white blood cell count, mostly of lymphocytes. Lymphocytic
  leukopenia was so severe that, when he was called for transplantation from a deceased
  donor, he was considered temporarily not eligible. We then describe a second ADPKD
  patient regularly treated with peritoneal dialysis, who had stable lymphopenia for
  years. Six years after starting PD, it was necessary to perform bone marrow aspirate
  to investigate the simultaneous presence of hypogammaglobulinemia together with
  M-protein and to exclude monoclonal gammopathy. All the exams performed did not
  show any significant results, the patients were re-included in the waiting list
  and one of them was transplanted. Given our experience and what is reported in the
  literature, there seems to be enough evidence to consider leukopenia as an extrarenal
  manifestation of ADPKD. However, the clinical significance of leukopenia in ADPKD
  patients is not known. It could be interesting to investigate the leucocytes' function
  and if ADPKD patients with leukopenia are more susceptible to infection, or not.
  Moreover, it would be very useful to analyze the relationship between such manifestation
  and genotype/phenotype."
