input_text: 'Subclavian steal syndrome in a hemodialysis patient after percutaneous
  transluminal angioplasty of arteriovenous access. INTRODUCTION: We describe a hemodialysis
  patient who developed subclavian steal syndrome via an arteriovenous fistula after
  percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 55-year-old female with
  end-stage renal failure due to polycystic kidney disease had been treated with hemodialysis
  for 10 years. Because of an autologous arteriovenous fistula stenosis, percutaneous
  transluminal angioplasty was performed. After successful treatment with percutaneous
  transluminal angioplasty, the patient developed dizziness. Magnetic resonance imaging
  with angiography of the brain and neck revealed normal bilateral subclavian and
  carotid arteries. However, flow in the left vertebral artery was not detected in
  time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography. The left vertebral artery showed
  completely reversed blood flow as detected by color duplex ultrasound. We also confirmed
  anterograde flow in the left vertebral artery by color duplex ultrasound with arteriovenous
  fistula compression. Arteriovenous flows before the arteriovenous fistula stenosis
  and post-percutaneous transluminal angioplasty were 1146 and 2239 mL/min, respectively.
  These findings suggested high-flow arteriovenous fistula led to the subclavian steal
  syndrome. The patient was subsequently treated by a flow reduction in the high-flow
  arteriovenous access using a modified graft inclusion technique. We decreased the
  arteriovenous fistula flow to 851 mL/min, which remained under 850 mL/min, 1 year
  later. The brain natriuretic peptide level and right-ventricular pressure also decreased
  after treatment. A modified graft inclusion technique was successful in decreasing
  the high flow of the arteriovenous fistula, and improved subclavian steal syndrome
  symptom and cardiac overload. CONCLUSION: This case shows that percutaneous transluminal
  angioplasty for an arteriovenous fistula may induce subclavian steal syndrome, and
  a modified graft inclusion technique was useful in improving the high flow of an
  arteriovenous fistula.'
