input_text: '[Preimplantation genetic diagnosis for infertile males with autosomal
  dominant polycystic kidney disease]. OBJECTIVE: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney
  disease (ADPKD) is one of the most common genetic renal diseases, which may cause
  oligoasthenospermia and azoospermia and result in male infertility. This study aimed
  to analyze the outcomes of preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) in male patients
  with ADPKD-induced infertility. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical
  data on 7 male patients with ADPKD-induced infertility undergoing PGD from April
  2015 to February 2017, including 6 cases of oligoasthenospermia and 1 case of obstructive
  azoospermia, all with the PKD1 gene heterozygous mutations. Following intracytoplasmic
  sperm injection (ICSI), we performed blastomere biopsy after 5 or 6 days of embryo
  culture and subjected the blastomeres to Sureplex whole-genome amplification, followed
  by haplotype linkage analysis, Sanger sequencing, array-based comparative genomic
  hybridization to assess the chromosomal ploidy of the unaffected embryos, and identification
  of the unaffected euploid embryos for transfer. RESULTS: One PGD cycle was completed
  for each of the 7 patients. Totally, 26 blastocysts were developed, of which 12
  were unaffected and diploid. Clinical pregnancies were achieved in 6 cases following
  7 cycles of frozen embryo transplantation, which included 5 live births and 1 spontaneous
  abortion. CONCLUSIONS: For males with ADPKD-induced infertility, PGD may contribute
  to high rates of clinical pregnancy and live birth and prevent ADPKD in the offspring
  as well. This finding is also meaningful for the ADPKD patients with normal fertility.'
