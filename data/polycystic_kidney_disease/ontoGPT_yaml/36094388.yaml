input_text: 'Native nephrectomy and arterial embolization of native kidney in autosomal
  dominant polycystic kidney disease patients: indications, timing and postoperative
  outcomes. INTRODUCTION: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is
  one of the most common causes of a need of renal replacement therapy. The need (elective
  vs. systematic) and timing of native kidney nephrectomy (before, after or during
  kidney transplantation) is a matter of debate and alternatives to surgery, mainly
  transcatheter arterial embolization have been explored. We performed a systematic
  review to report all available evidence on postintervention outcomes of native nephrectomy
  and arterial embolization in ADPKD patients. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A search on Medline,
  Embase, and Cochrane databases was performed to identify all studies reporting outcomes
  of native nephrectomy or arterial embolization in APKDs. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Concerning
  native nephrectomy, a total of 3626 patients in 37 studies were included with 735,
  210 and 2681 patients who underwent native nephrectomy respectively before, after
  or during kidney transplantation. Major complications were 12.2% in unilateral nephrectomy
  before transplantation, 25.0% in bilateral nephrectomy before transplantation, 17.7%
  in unilateral nephrectomy during transplantation, 20.8% in bilateral nephrectomy
  during transplantation and 23.8% in unilateral and bilateral nephrectomy after transplantation.
  A total of 230 patients in 7 series of arterial embolization were included. All
  arterial embolization were performed before transplantation. Mean volume reduction
  ranged from 36.3% at 3 months to 49% at 6 months. The major postintervention complication
  rate was 1%. CONCLUSIONS: Unilateral native nephrectomy before kidney transplantation
  was associated with the lowest major postoperative complication rate and appears
  to be the preferred strategy. Arterial embolization reduces kidney volume by 49%
  at 6 months. Arterial embolization could be considered when the reduction in size
  of the native kidney is not urgent.'
