input_text: 'Graft Kidney Artery Stenosis in Deceased Donor Kidney Transplant Recipient
  With Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease: A Case Report. Here, we report
  a rare case of transplant renal artery stenosis in a patient with autosomal dominant
  polycystic kidney disease who received a kidney from a deceased donor. The transplant
  renal artery stenosis was caused by the rotation and compression of the transplanted
  kidney, a consequence of the preexisting polycystic kidney. To address the transplant
  renal artery stenosis, the patient underwent additional surgical removal of the
  native polycystic kidney, which corrected the stenosis and restored the function
  of the transplanted kidney. This case highlighted the importance of monitoring for
  various causes of renal artery stenosis following kidney transplant.'
