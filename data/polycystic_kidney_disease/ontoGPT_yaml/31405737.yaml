input_text: 'Mucormycosis Presented with Facial Pain in a Renal Transplant Patient:
  A Case Report. INTRODUCTION: Mucormycosis is a severe infection in renal transplant
  recipients. Here, we report a case of maxillary sinus mucormycosis in a patient
  who presented with a facial pain complaint. CASE: A 51-year-old female patient with
  renal transplantation due to autosomal dominant, polycystic kidney disease and diabetic
  nephropathy was admitted to our hospital with facial pain and minimal edema of the
  left half of her face on the 8th month of transplantation. On physical examination,
  there was only tenderness and slight edema on the left half of the face. On the
  paranasal computed tomography, extensive soft tissue densities involving septations,
  filling the left maxillary sinus, extending to the nasal cavity, and obliterating
  the left osteometeal unit were observed. Because facial pain was not relieved by
  antibiotics and several, potent analgesic drugs on the second day, mucormycosis
  infection with bone involvement was suspected. A left maxillary sinus excision was
  performed. Microscopic examination of the debridement specimen revealed necrotic
  bone interspersed with fungal hyphae, and culture isolated Rhizopus oryzae. Liposomal
  amphotericin B was started. The patient was on tacrolimus, prednisolone, and mycophenolate
  mofetil. Tacrolimus was switched to cyclosporine to regulate serum glucose levels.
  The left maxillary sinus was washed with liposomal amphoterin B daily and curetted
  with intervals. The patient started dialysis because of severe renal function loss.
  The patient was discharged on the 96th day of liposomal amphotericin B. CONCLUSION:
  It should be kept in mind that mucormycosis may be present in the sinuses even if
  there is no evidence for nasal, oral, and dental examination in renal transplant
  patients with facial pain.'
