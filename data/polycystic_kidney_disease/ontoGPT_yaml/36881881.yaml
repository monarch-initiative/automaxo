input_text: 'Effect of Kidney transplantation on cyst growth in autosomal dominant
  polycystic kidney disease. BACKGROUND: In patients with autosomal dominant polycystic
  kidney disease (ADPKD), there is limited evidence of the rate of cyst progression
  after kidney transplantation. AIMS: To compare the height-adjusted total kidney
  volume (Ht-TKV) before and after transplantation in kidney transplant recipients
  (KTR) with -ADPKD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective cohort study. The estimate
  of Ht-TKV was calculated by the ellipsoid volume equation using measurements from
  CT or yearly MRI scans before and after transplantation. RESULTS: We included 30
  patients with -ADPKD who underwent kidney transplantation (age 49 +- 10.1 years,
  11 (37%) females, dialysis vintage 3 (1 - 6) years, and 4 (13%) underwent unilateral
  nephrectomy during the peritransplant period). The median follow-up time was 5 years
  (range 2 - 16 years). Transplantation was associated with a significant decrease
  in Ht-TKV after transplantation in 27 (90%) KTR. Median Ht-TKV decreased from 1,708
  (IQR 1,100 - 2,350) mL/m to 710 (IQR 420 - 1,380) mL/m after 6 years of follow-up
  (p < 0.001), with a mean Ht-TKV change rate per year after transplantation of -1.4,
  -11.8, -9.7, -12.7, -7.0, and -9.4% after 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 years, respectively.
  Even in 2 (7%) KTR without regression, the annual growth was < 1.5% per year after
  transplantation. CONCLUSION: Kidney transplantation reduced Ht-TKV after the first
  2 years of transplantation, and this decline was continuous for more than 6 years
  of follow-up.'
