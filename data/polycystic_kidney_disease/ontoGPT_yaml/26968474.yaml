input_text: 'Renal embolization. Recent developments in endovascular radiological
  techniques and devices make embolization as a major therapeutic option in many renal
  vascular or neoplastic diseases, before surgery. These techniques show a very good
  efficacy with a low morbidity and a better renal tolerance. Indications of embolization
  in nephrology are post-biopsy arteriovenous fistulas, renal graft intolerance, functional
  exclusion and polycystic kidney disease before transplantation. Others are at the
  interface between nephrology and urology as angiomyolipomas (mostly in tuberous
  sclerosis context), arterial aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations. '
