input_text: 'Total kidney and liver volume is a major risk factor for malnutrition
  in ambulatory patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. BACKGROUND:
  In patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), malnutrition
  may develop as renal function declines and the abdominal organs become enlarged.
  We investigated the relationship of intra-abdominal mass with nutritional status.
  METHODS: This cross-sectional study was performed at a tertiary hospital outpatient
  clinic. Anthropometric and laboratory data including serum creatinine, albumin,
  and cholesterol were collected, and kidney and liver volumes were measured. Total
  kidney and liver volume was defined as the sum of the kidney and liver volumes and
  adjusted by height (htTKLV). Nutritional status was evaluated by using modified
  subjective global assessment (SGA). RESULTS: In a total of 288 patients (47.9% female),
  the mean age was 48.3 +- 12.2 years and the mean estimated glomerular filtration
  rate (eGFR) was 65.3 +- 25.3 mL/min/1.73 m2. Of these patients, 21 (7.3%) were mildly
  to moderately malnourished (SGA score of 4 and 5) and 63 (21.7%) were at risk of
  malnutrition (SGA score of 6). Overall, patients with or at risk of malnutrition
  were older, had a lower body mass index, lower hemoglobin levels, and poorer renal
  function compared to the well-nourished group. However, statistically significant
  differences in these parameters were not observed in female patients, except for
  eGFR. In contrast, a higher htTKLV correlated with a lower SGA score, even in subjects
  with an eGFR >=45 mL/min/1.73 m2. Subjects with an htTKLV >=2340 mL/m showed an
  8.7-fold higher risk of malnutrition, after adjusting for age, hemoglobin, and eGFR.
  CONCLUSIONS: Nutritional risk was detected in 30% of ambulatory ADPKD patients with
  relatively good renal function. Intra-abdominal organomegaly was related to nutritional
  status independently from renal function deterioration.'
