input_text: 'Tips for TIPS: A combined percutaneous and transjugular approach for
  intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement after liver transplant. A 39-year-old
  female, liver transplanted for Autosomic Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD)
  developed refractory ascites early after surgery, with frequent need of large-volume
  paracentesis. This was associated with severe sarcopenia and kidney impairment.
  Liver biopsy showed a sinusoidal congestion with a significant enlargement of hepatic
  portal veins. This picture suggested the diagnosis of vascular obstructions. Due
  to an unfavorable passage through the piggy-back surgical anastomosis and the angle
  between the hepatic veins and the portal branches, a conventional placement of a
  transjugular portosystemic shunt (TIPS) was not feasible. An alternative approach
  was pursued with success, using a combined percutaneous-transjugular approach and
  achieving a complete recovery of ascites, sarcopenia and renal function.'
