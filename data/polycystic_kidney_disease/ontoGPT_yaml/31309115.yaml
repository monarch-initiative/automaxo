input_text: 'Bilateral Nephrectomy for Adult Polycystic Kidney Disease Does Not Affect
  the Graft Function of Transplant Patients and Does Not Result in Sensitisation.
  BACKGROUND: Native nephrectomy in Adult Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) patients
  is a major operation with controversy related to timing and indications. We present
  our single centre experience in transplanted patients and future candidates for
  transplantation. METHODS: Retrospective analysis from an anonymised database of
  bilateral nephrectomies for ADPKD patients. Results were reported as median, range,
  and percentage. Differences between groups were tested using ANOVA and t-test. Surgery
  was performed between January 2012 and July 2018. RESULTS: Thirty-three patients
  underwent bilateral native nephrectomy for APKD. 18 had a functioning kidney transplant
  (transplant group, 55%) while 15 patients were on dialysis (dialysis group, 45%)
  at the time of surgery; 8 patients of the latter group (24% of the whole cohort)
  were eventually transplanted. 53% were males, with median age of 55 years (27-71).
  Indications to surgery were the following: space (symptoms related to the size of
  the native kidneys or need to create space for transplantation) (59%), recurrent
  cyst infection (36%), haematuria (15%), pain (24%), and weight loss associated with
  cystic alteration on imaging (3%). In the transplant group, postoperative kidney
  function was not affected; haemoglobin serum levels significantly dropped in the
  whole cohort: 121 (82-150) g/L, versus 108 (58-154) g/L (p<0.001), with 14 patients
  being transfused perioperatively. Elevation of anti-HLA antibodies was noted in
  one female patient on dialysis, with no change in DSA levels and no rejection after
  transplant for all 26 transplanted patients. Median postoperative length of hospital
  stay was 9 days (6-71). One patient died (3%) after six months. Median follow-up
  for the whole cohort was 282 days (13-1834). Histopathological examination revealed
  incidental renal neoplasms in five cases (15%): 1 pT1a papillary renal cell carcinoma
  and 4 papillary adenomas. CONCLUSIONS: Native nephrectomy for ADPKD could be safely
  performed in case of refractory symptoms, suspect of cancer or to create space for
  transplantation. It does not affect graft function or DSA status of transplanted
  patients or the prospect of transplantation of those on the waiting list.'
