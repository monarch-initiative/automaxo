input_text: 'Low agreement between various eGFR formulae in pediatric and young adult
  ADPKD patients. BACKGROUND: Young autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD)
  patients are becoming the new target population for the development of new treatment
  options. Determination of a reliable equation for estimated glomerular filtration
  rate (eGFR) from early stages is needed with the promising potential interventional
  therapies. METHODS: Prospective and longitudinal study on a cohort of 68 genotyped
  ADPKD patients (age range 0-23 years) with long-term follow-up. Commonly used equations
  for eGFR were compared for their relative performance. RESULTS: The revised Schwartz
  formula (CKiD) showed a highly significant decline in eGFR with aging (- 3.31 mL/min/1.73
  m2/year, P < 0.0001). The recently updated equation by the Schwartz group (CKiDU25)
  showed a smaller (- 0.90 mL/min/1.73 m2/year) but significant (P = 0.001) decline
  in eGFR with aging and also showed a significant sex difference (P < 0.0001), not
  observed by the other equations. In contrast, the full age spectrum (FAS) equations
  (FAS-SCr, FAS-CysC, and the combined) showed no age and sex dependency. The prevalence
  of hyperfiltration is highly dependent on the formula used, and the highest prevalence
  was observed with the CKiD Equation (35%). CONCLUSIONS: The most widely used methods
  to calculate eGFR in ADPKD children (CKiD and CKiDU25 equations) were associated
  with unexpected age or sex differences. The FAS equations were age- and sex-independent
  in our cohort. Hence, the switch from the CKiD to CKD-EPI equation at the transition
  from pediatric to adult care causes implausible jumps in eGFR, which could be misinterpreted.
  Having reliable methods to calculate eGFR is indispensable for clinical follow-up
  and clinical trials. A higher resolution version of the Graphical abstract is available
  as Supplementary information.'
