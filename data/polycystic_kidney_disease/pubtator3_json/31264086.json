Traditionally, dysfunction has been attributed to catheter malposition, but whether the location of the catheter tip in the small pelvis really determines proper function is unclear. METHODS: We reviewed 900 abdominal X-ray images of PD patients from a 7-year period in two PD units that use different catheter types (straight and Swan Neck Curled). RESULTS: In 52% of the images, the dialysis catheter tip was located in the ideal position in the small pelvis and in 48% in other sites. Peritoneal catheter function was normal at the time of imaging in 87% of those with ideal catheter tip position, and in 74% of those with other than ideal position. The tip was located in small pelvis in 35% of images performed during catheter dysfunction and in 56% of those performed during normal catheter function. There were no differences between two catheter types. The positive predictive value of abdominal X-ray images to predict catheter function was 26%, and the negative predictive value 87%. We also found a significant positive correlation between polycystic kidney disease and normal catheter function. In contrast, obese patients were more likely to have catheter malfunction. Previous abdominal surgery was not associated with catheter dysfunction. CONCLUSION: Our data showed a higher probability of normal function of peritoneal catheters whose tips were located in the small pelvis. However, also malpositioned catheters generally functioned well, and malpositioning of the PD catheter did not in itself explain its malfunction.",
