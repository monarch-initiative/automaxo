                    "text": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Indications for laparoscopic renal surgery are increasing; however, benefits in adult polycystic kidney disease (APKD) remain uncertain. Our objective was to systematically synthesize the reported literature on safety, feasibility, complications, and early outcomes of laparoscopic nephrectomy in APKD to determine clinical benefits for surgical practice. METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis of the published literature reporting on laparoscopic nephrectomy in APKD between 1991 and 2013. The criteria from the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) study were used to assess the quality of reported literature. RESULTS: One prospective and 15 retrospective studies of low to modest quality (according to the STROBE checklist) were identified, reporting on 293 patients who underwent laparoscopic nephrectomy for APKD. None of the studies was a randomized clinical trial (RCT). The transperitoneal approach was the most commonly used technique. Body mass index ranged from 16 to 57 (mean 26.2 kg/m(2); 53% of patients were dialysis dependent, and 31% had a previous or simultaneous transplant. Kidney length ranged from 8 to 50 cm (mean 34.5cm), and the mean mass of affected kidneys was 1647 g (range 132 g-7200 g). Duration of hospital stay ranged from 2.6 to 11 days (mean 4.9 days). Operative time ranged from 90 to 568 minutes, with 16.2% of patients needing blood transfusion. There were 24 intraoperative complications and 68 postoperative complications, a rate of 8% and 24%, respectively. A total of 16 (5%) cases were converted to an open technique. No mortality was reported in any of the included studies. CONCLUSION: The quality of the included studies is poor, and it is difficult to argue for or against change in clinical practice because the evidence included is of level 3 and 4 only. Higher quality studies are needed to demonstrate that the technique is generalizable across all populations.",
