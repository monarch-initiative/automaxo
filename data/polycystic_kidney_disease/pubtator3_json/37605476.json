Limited international data suggest comparable patient and graft survival in kidney transplant recipients with and without HIV. All PLWHIV aged >=18 years who received a kidney transplant between 2000 and 2020 were identified by retrospective data initially extracted from Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry (ANZDATA), with additional HIV-specific clinical data extracted from linked local health-care records. Twenty-five PLWHIV and kidney failure received their first kidney transplant in Australia between January 2000 and December 2020. Majority were male (85%), with median age 54 years (interquartile range, IQR 43-57). Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis was the most common primary kidney disease (20%), followed by polycystic kidney disease (16%). 80% of patients underwent induction with basiliximab and none with anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG). Participants were followed for median time of 3.5 years (IQR 2.0-6.5). Acute rejection occurred in 24% of patients. Two patients lost their allografts and three died. Virological escape occurred in 28% of patients, with a maximum viral load of 190 copies/mL. In conclusion, kidney transplantation in PLWHIV in Australia is occurring with increasing frequency. Acute rejection is more common than in Australia's general transplant population, but this does not appear to be associated with higher rates of graft failure or mortality out to four years.",
