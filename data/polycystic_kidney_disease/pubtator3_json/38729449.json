                    "text": "INTRODUCTION: Antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) is the most common cause of immune-mediated allograft failure after kidney transplant and impacts allograft survival. Previous sensitization is a major risk factor for development of donor specific antibodies (DSA). AMR can have a wide range of clinical features such as impaired kidney function, proteinuria/hypertension or can be subclinical. HLA molecules have specific regions of antigens binding antibodies called epitopes and eplets are considered essential components responsible for immune recognition. We present a patient with subclinical AMR 1 week post transplantation. CASE REPORT: A 48-year-old, caucasian woman with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) secondary to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) on peritoneal dialysis was registered in deceased donor waitlist. She was a hypersensitized patient from 3 prior pregnancies with a calculated panel reactive antibody of 93,48%. She was transplanted through kidney paired exchange donation with no evidence of DSA pre transplantation. Surgery and post-op were unremarkable with excellent and immediate graft function. Per protocol DSA levels on the 5th day was DR1 of 3300 MFI, with an increase in MFI by day 13 with 7820 MFI and a new B41 1979MFI. Allograft kidney biopsy findings were diagnostic of AMR and she was treated with immunoglobulin and plasmapheresis. As early onset AMR post transplantation was observed an anamnestic response was hypothesized from a previous exposure to allo-HLA. We decided to type her husband, her son's father, which was presented with DSA. Mismatch eplet analysis revealed a shared 41 T and 67LQ eplets between the donor and husband, responsible for the reactivity and new HLA class I B41 and HLA class II DR1 DSA, respectively. DISCUSSION: Shared eplets between the patient husband and donor was responsible for the alloimmune response and early development of DSAs. This case highlights the importance of early monitoring DSA levels in highly sensitized patients after transplant in order to promptly address and lower inflammatory damage. Mismatch eplet analysis can provide a thorough and precise evaluation of immune compatibility providing a useful technique to immune risk stratification, donor selection and post-transplant immunosuppressive therapy and monitoring.",
