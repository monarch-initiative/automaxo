PURPOSE: We propose the adoption of autologous blood transfusion (ABT) in transplant candidates and recipients referred to elective surgery. METHODS: We present a case of a 45-year-old man with chronic kidney disease stage 5 due to polycystic kidney disease, who was qualified for a native kidney nephrectomy (NKN) before kidney transplantation. Before the scheduled surgery, the patient was referred to a blood donation center for blood collection. RESULTS: During 2 consecutive visits, autologous blood was collected uneventfully, and this allowed for the preparation of 2 units of red blood cell concentrates and a unit of plasma. Pre- and post-donation hemoglobin values were 11.9 and 10.4 g/dL, respectively. The NKN procedure was complicated by intra-abdominal bleeding from an accessory aberrant artery of the kidney. Hemoglobin dropped to 6.8 g/dL and was treated with ABT, followed by artery embolization. This allowed for an increase of hemoglobin to 8.3 mg/dL and avoidance of allotransfusion. Six weeks after NKN, the patient underwent successful kidney transplantation from a living donor. Panel reactive antibodies before transplantation were 0%, and graft function has been excellent during 20 months of observation. CONCLUSION: An autologous blood collection is a feasible option for patients with chronic kidney disease. ABT should be considered the procedure of choice when qualifying potential waiting list candidates and solid organ recipients for elective surgeries.",
