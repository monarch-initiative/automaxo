38084006	Prophylactic Intramedullary Rodding After Femoral Lengthening in Patients With Achondroplasia and Hypochondroplasia.	BACKGROUND: Femoral fracture after femoral lengthening in patients with achondroplasia and hypochondroplasia is a frequent complication, occurring in up to 30%. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the effectiveness of prophylactic intramedullary rodding in preventing this complication. METHODS: Multicenter retrospective study involving 86 femoral lengthening procedures in 43 patients with achondroplasia or hypochondroplasia. Forty-two femora (21 patients) were prophylactically managed with intramedullary Rush rodding after external fixation removal (11 females and 10 males, mean age 14.6 years) compared with 44 femora (22 patients) without prophylactic intramedullary rodding (13 females and 9 males, mean age 15.2 years). The mean amount of lengthening in the rodding group was 13.3 cm (52.6%) with an External Fixation Index of 25.8 days/cm; in patients without rodding was 14.3 cm (61.5%) and 24.5 days/cm, respectively. RESULTS: Seven cases (15.9%) without rodding developed fractures. Four of them required surgical correction due to displacement or shortening. Only 1 patient (2.4%) had fracture of the femur after prophylactic rodding, and surgery was not required. The incidence of femur fracture was significantly lower in the prophylactic rodding group compared with the nonrodding group (2.4% vs. 15.9%, respectively; P =0.034). There were no cases of infection or avascular necrosis. CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic intramedullary rodding is a safe and effective method for preventing femoral fractures after femoral lengthening in patients with achondroplasia or hypochondroplasia. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III-a retrospective comparative study.
21225389	Hypochondroplasia due to FGFR3 gene mutation (N540K) and mosaic form of Down syndrome in the same patient.	The simultaneous presence of Down syndrome and achondroplasia has rarely been reported in the literature, and our search revealed only six patients with such an association. We are reporting the first case of a patient with Down syndrome and hypochondroplasia. In this patient, Down syndrome was clinically recognised and confirmed by the cytogenetic finding of mosaic karyotype (47,XX,+21/46,XX) shortly after birth. She was subsequently diagnosed with hypochondroplasia at the age of 6 years when disproportional short stature, stocky habitus and macrocephaly were observed. These phenotypic findings were later confirmed by the presence of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene mutation N540K. The overlapping common clinical features of Down syndrome and hypochondroplasia resulted in delayed diagnosis of hypochondroplasia in our patient and the associated deleterious effect on her linear growth. Her final height is 126.5 cm, which is -3.76 standard deviations (SD) lower than the median height in patients with Down syndrome, and is under the lower borderline of the adult height range for women with hypochondroplasia.
20226364	Improving mobility in a client with hypochondroplasia (dwarfism): a case report.	A client with hypochondroplasia dwarfism and a medical diagnosis of spinal stenosis had found that her ability to walk had decreased over the past 7 years from easily walking 6 miles (10 K) to now needing to rest every half block (171 ft/52 m) due to muscle fatigue. Such weakness is consistent with nerve impingement due to spinal stenosis, which would not be improved by massage. However, during a preliminary assessment, it was found that both lower legs had severe fascial adhesions, possibly compressing lower leg blood vessels and nerves. It was hoped that by using myofascial massage techniques to relieve the adhesions, her mobility would improve over the course of 8 sessions. Myofascial massage techniques showed positive results in reducing adhesions, improving circulation, and increasing the distance the client could walk before resting to 2 blocks (686 ft/209 m). Working with this client showed that Licensed Massage Practitioners (LMPs) can easily accommodate clients of very short height.
17717461	Distraction osteogenesis of the lower extremity in patients with achondroplasia/hypochondroplasia treated with transplantation of culture-expanded bone marrow cells and platelet-rich plasma.	BACKGROUND: Longer treatment period in distraction osteogenesis (DO) of the lower extremity leads to more frequent complications. We have developed a new technique of transplantation of culture-expanded bone marrow cells (BMCs) and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) during DO to accelerate new bone formation. To assess the efficacy of this cell therapy, retrospective comparative study was conducted between the bones treated with BMC and PRP and the bones treated without BMC and PRP during DO in patients with achondroplasia (ACH) and hypochondroplasia (HCH). METHODS: Fifty-six bones in 20 patients (ACH, 16; HCH, 4) that were lengthened in our hospital were divided into 2 groups. Twenty-four bones (femora, 12; tibiae, 12) in 11 patients (boys, 7; girls, 4) were treated with BMC and PRP transplantation (BMC-PRP group), whereas 32 bones (femora, 14; tibiae, 18) in 9 patients (boys, 3; girls, 6) did not undergo additional cell therapy (control group). The parameters, including the age at operation, the increase in length, and the healing index, were compared between the 2 groups. The clinical outcome was also compared between the femoral and tibial lengthenings. RESULTS: Bone marrow cells (average number, +/- SD, 3.2 +/- 1.37 x 10 cells) and PRP (average platelet concentration +/- SD, 2.36 +/- 0.57 x 10 cells/muL) were transplanted. Although there were no significant differences in the age at operation and the length gained between the 2 groups, the average healing index of the BMC-PRP group (27.1 +/- 6.89 d/cm) was significantly lower than that of the control group (36.2 +/- 10.4 d/cm) (P = 0.0005). The femoral lengthening showed significantly faster healing than did the tibial lengthening in the BMC-PRP group (P = 0.0092). CONCLUSIONS: Transplantation of BMC and PRP shortened the treatment period by accelerating new bone regeneration during DO of the lower extremity in patients with ACH and HCH, especially in the femoral lengthening.
8767930	[Growth hormone therapy in childhood. Growth hormone therapy in small children without growth hormone deficiency].	The availability of unlimited amounts of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) has now made it possible to investigate its growth-promoting effect in children in whom growth hormone production is not deficient. In girls suffering from the Ullrich Turner syndrome, treatment with rhGH increases final height by some 6 to 8 cm. An increase in growth rate has also been observed in children with renal insufficiency, and in children with intrauterine growth retardation. Favourable results have also been reported in children receiving glucocorticoids for such chronic conditions as rheumatoid arthritis, and in youngsters with hypochondroplasia. In a further group of children with various disorders an improvement in the growth rate has been observed, although nothing can yet be said about the outcome in terms of final height. To achieve an increase in growth rate, pharmacological doses of growth hormone higher than those used in children with growth hormone deficiency are necessary. For this reason, the risk of unwanted side effects might be higher than in the latter.
18210083	[Achondroplasia and hypochondroplasia in paediatric orthopaedics].	Achondroplasia and hypochondroplasia are the most common forms of short stature. The leading sign is the diminished body height. Most cases of achondroplasia can be detected by clinical examination. Hypochondroplasia is more often not diagnosed until preschool age.In achondroplasia many different orthopaedic problems can arise, which influence the ADL. Mainly pathologic alterations of the occipitocervical region or a stenosis of the medullary cavity should be expected. In the limbs a bow-leg deformity and hyperlaxity of the ligaments often can be seen, which in some cases restrict walking capacity. Even if many people of short stature contemplate a lengthening procedure, the correction of deformities is much more important. The CORA method should be used in planning any osteotomy.
24292534	[Clinical condition and therapy of bone diseases].	Skeletal dysplasia is the term which represents disorders including growth and differentiation of bone, cartilage and ligament. A lot of diseases are included, and new disorders have been added. However, the therapy of most bone diseases is less well-established. Achondroplasia, hypochondroplasia, and osteogenesis imperfecta are most frequent bone diseases. There is no curative treatment for these diseases, however, supportive therapies are available ; for example, growth-hormone therapy for achondroplasia and hypochondroplasia, and bisphosphonate therapy for osteogenesis imperfecta. In addition, enzyme replacement therapy for hypophosphatasia is now on clinical trial. 
9539301	Effect of growth hormone therapy in children with achondroplasia: growth pattern, hypothalamic-pituitary function, and genotype.	OBJECTIVE: Although there are a few reports on GH therapy in achondroplasia, these were based on a small sample and/or short-term observation. To clarify the effectiveness of GH treatment on short stature in achondroplasia and hypochondroplasia, a long-term treatment study in a larger number of patients was performed. METHOD: Forty-two children (16 males and 26 females, age 3-14 years) with achondroplasia were examined in this study. Initially, we evaluated hypothalamic-pituitary function and point mutation analysis as previously reported. After the evaluation, the children were treated with GH for more than 2 years; then post-treatment growth velocity and body proportion parameters were determined. RESULTS: The 35 typical variants of our achondroplasia patients showed previously reported point mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 gene. The annual height gain during GH therapy was significantly greater than that before therapy (3.9 +/- 1.0 cm/year before treatment vs 6.5 +/- 1.8 cm/year for the first year and 4.6 +/- 1.6 cm/year for the second year of treatment). The body disproportion had not been aggravated during the treatment period. CONCLUSION: We conclude that GH might be beneficial in the treatment of short stature in children with achondroplasia in the first 2 years of treatment.
22137367	A pilot study of discontinuous, insulin-like growth factor 1-dosing growth hormone treatment in young children with FGFR3 N540K-mutated hypochondroplasia.	OBJECTIVE: To assess the growth promoting effect of a recombinant growth hormone (rGH) treatment protocol adjusted on insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) dosing in children affected by the most severe forms of FGFR3 N540K-mutated hypochondroplasia. STUDY DESIGN: Midterm results of an open-label, single-center, nonrandomized, 2003-2020 pilot trial to final stature, including 6 children (mean age, 2.6 +- 0.7 years; mean height SDS, -3.0 +- 0.5) with the N540K mutation of FGFR3 gene who received an rGH dosage titrated to an IGF-1 level close to 1.5 SDS of the normal range. rGH therapy was interrupted 1 day per week, 1 month per year, and 6 months every 2 years. RESULTS: The mean height SDS increased by 1.9 during the 6.1 +- 0.9-year study period, reaching -0.8 to -1.3 at age 8.7 +- 1 years. The mean+-SDS baseline IGF-1 value was -1.6 +- 0.5 before rGH treatment and 1.4+-0.3 during the last year of observation. The average cumulative rGH dose was 0.075 +- 0.018 mg/kg/day (range, 0.059-0.100 mg/kg/day). Trunk/leg disproportion was improved. CONCLUSION: IGF-1-dosing rGH treatment durably improves growth and reduces body disproportion in children with severe forms of hypochondroplasia.
1785332	Growth-promoting effect of human growth hormone on patients with achondroplasia.	To evaluate the effect of human growth hormone (hGH) on the growth of children with achondroplasia, three patients with achondroplasia and one patient with hypochondroplasia were treated with 0.5 IU/kg/W of pituitary-extracted hGH for 6-12 months. Mean height velocity was significantly increased from 4.0 +/- 0.4 to 7.5 +/- 0.7 cm/year (P less than 0.05) by hGH. The tibial index, defined as the length/width ratio of left tibia, did not change during the treatment, indicating that hGH promotes growth without exaggeration of tubular bone deformity. Case 2, who had atlantoaxial dislocation, developed sleep apnea and neurological deficits during the second hGH treatment, but these were cured by operation. Thus, hGH therapy is effective in promoting growth in patients with achondroplasia, but the complication of atlantoaxial dislocation should be explored and corrected before the treatment.
8641067	Oblique proximal tibial osteotomy for the correction of tibia vara in the young.	Proximal tibial osteotomy in the growing patient historically has been associated with a high rate of neurovascular complications and malunion. Here is reported a technique of valgus proximal tibial osteotomy, of the incomplete closing wedge type, that has avoided neurovascular compromise while achieving reliable correction and rapid bony union. Oblique proximal tibial valgus osteotomies with lateral tension plate fixation were performed on 18 tibiae in 14 patients (age range, 5-25 years) with tibia vara. The primary diagnosis was Blount's disease in 13 tibiae, achondroplasia in 2 tibiae, multiple epiphyseal dysplasia in 2 tibiae, and hypochondroplasia in 1 tibia. No postoperative plaster immobilization was necessary. All patients were able to bear weight fully by 8 weeks after surgery. Average angular correction was 18 degrees. One patient had overcorrection because of an unrecognized intraoperative fracture of the media] tibial cortex. There were no neurovascular complications. No growth disturbance of the proximal tibial physis was noted. Oblique proximal tibial osteotomy with tension plate fixation successfully corrected varus deformity of the proximal tibia in the growing patient without damage to the proximal tibial physis or neurovascular compromise.
25323764	Efficacy and safety of growth hormone treatment in children with hypochondroplasia: comparison with an historical cohort.	BACKGROUND/AIMS: Hypochondroplasia (HCH) is a skeletal dysplasia characterized by disproportionate short stature. The aims of the study are to evaluate efficacy and safety of recombinant human growth hormone (r-hGH) therapy in HCH children, when compared with a historical cohort of untreated HCH children. METHODS: Nineteen HCH patients with an initial height standard deviation score (SDS) <=-2 and a mean age of 9.3 +- 3.1 years were treated with a mean r-hGH dose of 0.053 mg/kg/day over 3 years. Growth charts were derived from the historical cohort (n = 40). RESULTS: Height gain in the treated population was +0.62 +- 0.81 SDS greater than in the general population, and +1.39 +- 0.9 SDS greater than in the historical untreated HCH cohort (mean gain of 7.4 +- 6.6 cm gain). A negative correlation between height gain and age at treatment initiation was reported (p = 0.04). There was no significant difference in response between patients with fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 mutations and those without. No treatment-related serious adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: r-hGH treatment is well tolerated and effective in improving growth in HCH patients, particularly when started early. The treatment effect varies greatly and must be evaluated for each patient during treatment to determine the value of continued therapy.
10665662	Perceptions of the outcome of orthopedic surgery in patients with chondrodysplasias.	As part of a larger survey of patients with chondrodysplasias, 197 patients or their parents were asked whether they had undergone orthopedic surgery related to their chondrodysplasia and, if so, to rate their impression of the outcome. Seventy-four patients (37.6%) had undergone a total of 152 procedures (221 if concurrent bilateral operations are counted separately). The percentage of patients treated surgically ranged from a low of 8.3% for hypochondroplasia to a high of 87.5% for diastrophic dysplasia. Of the patients who had surgery, the mean number of procedures per patient ranged from 1.0 for hypochondroplasia to 2.69 for pseudoachondroplasia. Of 180 individual procedures related to the limbs, the outcome in 88.8% was judged 'a bit better' or higher and in 68.8% 'much better' or higher. The responses ranged from a low of 70.4 and 66.7%, respectively for proximal femoral osteotomies to a high of 100 and 85.9% for hip replacement. The comparable figures for spine related surgery were 81.8 and 48.5% with a low of 58.3 and 50.0% for foramen magnum-cervical surgery and a high of 93.8 and 43.8% for thoracolumbar procedures. The expressed perception of lack of satisfaction varied not only by procedure but by diagnosis. Overall, patients perceived a high level of post-surgical improvement, although a number experienced subsequent deterioration and the need for further intervention.
