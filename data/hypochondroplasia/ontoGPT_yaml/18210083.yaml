input_text: '[Achondroplasia and hypochondroplasia in paediatric orthopaedics]. Achondroplasia
  and hypochondroplasia are the most common forms of short stature. The leading sign
  is the diminished body height. Most cases of achondroplasia can be detected by clinical
  examination. Hypochondroplasia is more often not diagnosed until preschool age.In
  achondroplasia many different orthopaedic problems can arise, which influence the
  ADL. Mainly pathologic alterations of the occipitocervical region or a stenosis
  of the medullary cavity should be expected. In the limbs a bow-leg deformity and
  hyperlaxity of the ligaments often can be seen, which in some cases restrict walking
  capacity. Even if many people of short stature contemplate a lengthening procedure,
  the correction of deformities is much more important. The CORA method should be
  used in planning any osteotomy.'
