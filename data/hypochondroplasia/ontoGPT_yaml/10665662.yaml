input_text: Perceptions of the outcome of orthopedic surgery in patients with chondrodysplasias.
  As part of a larger survey of patients with chondrodysplasias, 197 patients or their
  parents were asked whether they had undergone orthopedic surgery related to their
  chondrodysplasia and, if so, to rate their impression of the outcome. Seventy-four
  patients (37.6%) had undergone a total of 152 procedures (221 if concurrent bilateral
  operations are counted separately). The percentage of patients treated surgically
  ranged from a low of 8.3% for hypochondroplasia to a high of 87.5% for diastrophic
  dysplasia. Of the patients who had surgery, the mean number of procedures per patient
  ranged from 1.0 for hypochondroplasia to 2.69 for pseudoachondroplasia. Of 180 individual
  procedures related to the limbs, the outcome in 88.8% was judged 'a bit better'
  or higher and in 68.8% 'much better' or higher. The responses ranged from a low
  of 70.4 and 66.7%, respectively for proximal femoral osteotomies to a high of 100
  and 85.9% for hip replacement. The comparable figures for spine related surgery
  were 81.8 and 48.5% with a low of 58.3 and 50.0% for foramen magnum-cervical surgery
  and a high of 93.8 and 43.8% for thoracolumbar procedures. The expressed perception
  of lack of satisfaction varied not only by procedure but by diagnosis. Overall,
  patients perceived a high level of post-surgical improvement, although a number
  experienced subsequent deterioration and the need for further intervention.
