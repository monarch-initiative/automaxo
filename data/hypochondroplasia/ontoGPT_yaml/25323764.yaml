input_text: 'Efficacy and safety of growth hormone treatment in children with hypochondroplasia:
  comparison with an historical cohort. BACKGROUND/AIMS: Hypochondroplasia (HCH) is
  a skeletal dysplasia characterized by disproportionate short stature. The aims of
  the study are to evaluate efficacy and safety of recombinant human growth hormone
  (r-hGH) therapy in HCH children, when compared with a historical cohort of untreated
  HCH children. METHODS: Nineteen HCH patients with an initial height standard deviation
  score (SDS) <=-2 and a mean age of 9.3 +- 3.1 years were treated with a mean r-hGH
  dose of 0.053 mg/kg/day over 3 years. Growth charts were derived from the historical
  cohort (n = 40). RESULTS: Height gain in the treated population was +0.62 +- 0.81
  SDS greater than in the general population, and +1.39 +- 0.9 SDS greater than in
  the historical untreated HCH cohort (mean gain of 7.4 +- 6.6 cm gain). A negative
  correlation between height gain and age at treatment initiation was reported (p
  = 0.04). There was no significant difference in response between patients with fibroblast
  growth factor receptor 3 mutations and those without. No treatment-related serious
  adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: r-hGH treatment is well tolerated and
  effective in improving growth in HCH patients, particularly when started early.
  The treatment effect varies greatly and must be evaluated for each patient during
  treatment to determine the value of continued therapy.'
