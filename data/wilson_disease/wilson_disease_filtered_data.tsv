30618165	Cardiac arrest in Wilson's disease after curative liver transplantation: a life-threatening complication of myocardial copper excess?	We report the case of a 38-year-old man who presented with cardiac arrest 1 year after curative liver transplantation for Wilson's disease. Clinical work-up proofed myocardial copper and iron accumulation using mass spectrometry, which led most likely to myocardial fibrosis as visualized by cardiovascular magnetic resonance (unprecedented delayed enhancement pattern) and endomyocardial biopsy. Consequently, cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation and subsequent episodes of sustained ventricular tachycardia were considered as primary cardiac manifestation of Wilson's disease. This can, as illustrated by our case, occur even late after curative liver transplantation, which is an important fact that treating physicians should be aware of during clinical follow-up of these patients.
20453399	Current state of Wilson disease patients in central Japan.	OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the current state of patients with Wilson disease in central Japan. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1999 and 2007, 30 patients were diagnosed as having Wilson disease with an International Diagnostic Score of 4 or more. The phenotypes, genotypes and post-diagnostic courses of these patients were analyzed. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients had ATP7B mutations responsible for Wilson disease. Four patients had a single mutant chromosome. There were 2 major mutations of 2333 G>T and 2871 delC (40%), and 6 novel mutations (13%) in our patients. The first clinical manifestation was the hepatic form in 22, neurological form in 5, and hemolysis in 3 patients. The hepatic form was diagnosed around the age of 13 years, followed by neurological complication with a time lag of 9 years. Thus, some patients, especially patients with the neurological form, did not undergo early diagnostic tests including ATP7B analysis. During the post-diagnosis period, 3 patients were hospitalized for recurrent liver disease, and 2 patients committed suicide. One female patient died from acute hepatic failure associated with encephalopathy after fertilization therapy, while 2 male patients recovered from encephalopathy-free, prolonged hepatic failure after noncompliance with drug therapy. The King's Scores for liver transplantation were below the cut-off in both cases. CONCLUSION: To minimize delayed diagnosis, ceruloplasmin determination and ATP7B analysis may be recommended to patients showing hepatic damage of unknown etiology. At gene diagnosis, appropriate management of patients including compliance education and emotional care to prevent suicide might be important.
23289267	[Wilson disease as the significant risk factor of surgical treatment--clinical case report].	Wilson Disease (W ) is a rare inborn disorder of cooper metabolism. In approximately 40% of cases signs and symptoms of abnormal liver functions are observed due to hepatic inflammation, cirrhosis or insufficiency. The mainstay treatment is the conservative treatment with zinc (eg Zincteral) or penicillamine. The Authors present a patient with WD who underwent surgery because of an advanced rectal prolapse (laparotomy, rectal mobilization, rectopexy, the partial sigmoid colon resection with the primary anastomosis). The postoperative course was complicated by anastomotic leakage and a subsequent diffuse peritonitis. The patient required relaparotomy and three weeks treatment in the intensive therapy unit. The Authors consider the WD as a significant risk factor for surgical patients. Surgical treatment of patients with WD should be least invasive.
28433106	Novel perspectives on Wilson disease treatment.	Wilson disease is an autosomal-recessive copper overload disorder causing hepatic and neurologic symptoms. Commonly used medical therapy shows satisfactory results with regard to hepatic disease but only limited effects in neurologically affected patients. In recent years several new therapy options have been developed, showing promising results that might improve the management of Wilson disease in the near future. Optimization of treatment regimens depending on biochemical response pattern seems worthwhile, especially in the decoppering phase of therapy. The chelator tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) is a promising therapy option, currently under clinical investigation. TTM is a fast-acting and very potent chelator and appears to be associated with early neurologic deterioration after initiation of therapy to a lower extent than the drugs currently used. Treatment with nonchelating drugs characterized by alternative modes of action is under investigation, but restricted to animal or in vitro studies to date. This includes basic research studies demonstrating proof of principle for successful cell or gene therapy in Wilson disease in order to restore sufficient biliary copper excretion, even before the onset of disease.

9311362	Penicillamine-related neurologic syndrome in a child affected by Wilson disease with hepatic presentation.	OBJECTIVES: To describe a case of penicillamine-related neurologic symptoms in a 9-year-old boy affected by asymptomatic Wilson disease with hepatic presentation; to compare this case with similar cases in adults; and to discuss the role of zinc therapy as an alternative treatment for patients who have an adverse reaction to penicillamine therapy. SETTING: Referral hospital. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The occurrence of a neurologic syndrome that severely impaired a child's usual daily activities and his health-related quality of life after the institution of penicillamine therapy. RESULTS: Initial penicillamine therapy was chronologically related to the development of progressive neurologic deterioration in the absence of other causes of neurologic syndrome. The discontinuation of penicillamine therapy and the initiation of zinc therapy were followed by a prompt disappearance of neurologic symptoms and a return to neurologic baseline status. CONCLUSIONS: Penicillamine therapy, even in children affected by Wilson disease with hepatic presentation alone and without neurologic disease at the beginning of treatment, may trigger neurologic symptoms. Zinc therapy may be a satisfactory alternative.
22541062	Other genetic liver diseases in children.	Wilson disease is rare but proteiform, and should be suspected in any child with liver disease and older than 3 years of age. The treatment is very efficient, and must be taken life-long. Fifteen percent of patients with alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency develop a neonatal jaundice, and 3% a cirrhosis in childhood. There is no specific treatment except liver transplantation. Five percent of cystic fibrosis patients develop a cirrhosis, with a very slow progression. Milder abnormalities are frequent, as well as biliary stones. Liver disease in ciliopathies may be a congenital hepatic fibrosis, with risks of portal hypertension and cholangitis, or a more variable biliary disease. Gilbert disease is frequent and benign. Crigler-Najjar syndrome is rare, severe, and may be an indication for liver or liver-cell transplantation.
29274796	[Compliance with treatment in Wilson's disease: On the interest of a multidisciplinary closer follow-up].	BACKGROUND: Compliance with treatment is very important for patients who suffer from Wilson's disease, a rare genetic disorder. They can benefit a long-life and effective treatment. The purpose of our study is to identify the level of compliance in Wilson's disease patients and features associated with compliance as well. METHODS: This is a prospective study carried out in the National Reference Center for Wilson Disease (based in Paris and Lyon) over a 8 months period. Patients were evaluated on the first (M0) and last month (M8) with a questionnaire evaluating the number of missed treatment doses, a self-questionnaire collecting the reasons for non-compliance, and analogic scales analyzing the doctor-patient relationship and their behavior towards the treatment. The severity of depression symptoms was investigated by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). A detailed phone call interview was conducted by a psychologist every two months to evaluate their compliance and feeling. RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients were included. The mean age of patients was 34 years (+-9.9). At M0, 84.6% had a poor compliance with treatment. They were diagnosed more recently (P=0.049) with a higher proportion involving neurological disorders (P=0.007). Age, the type of treatment and the quality of the doctor-patient relationship were not associated with the outcome; 38.5% suffered from depressive symptoms. At M8, 56.8% of patients were poor compliants and 21.6% presented depressive symptoms. CONCLUSION: Wilsons's disease patients have important problems with compliance, without necessary being depressed. A close follow-up may help them become compliant, particularly those with neurological symptoms.
21757830	Excess copper chelating therapy for Wilson disease induces anemia and liver dysfunction.	A 37-year-old man was diagnosed with Wilson disease at the age of 14. His first manifestations were neurological. He was treated with trientine for more than 10 years and suffered from anemia and liver dysfunction. Wilson disease is a genetic disorder characterized by accumulation of copper in the body. Excess copper is toxic, but copper is an essential trace element. Copper-binding ceruloplasmin is important for iron metabolism. Excess copper chelating treatment-induced anemia and iron deposition in the liver was suspected. Proper monitoring of copper status is important for the management of Wilson disease.

19166126	Haemolytic anaemia and acute liver failure--the initial manifestations of Wilson's disease.	We describe a case of a 16-year-old girl with Wilson disease, which was initially presented as Coombs-negative haemolytic anaemia and acute liver failure. The diagnosis was based on the findings of low ceruloplasmin serum level and high copper levels both in serum and 24-hour urinary excretion. The patient underwent orthotopic liver transplantation. A DNA-based diagnostic tool confirmed Wilson's disease: the patient was p.H1069Q homozygote. Based on further molecular-genetic examinations in the family, Wilson disease was diagnosed seven days later in one of the patient's asymptomatic brothers. The proband's cousin was confirmed as a carrier of the p.H1069Q mutation (Fig. 1, Ref. 24).

32520831	Pediatric Wilson Disease Presenting as Acute Liver Failure: An Individual Patient Data Meta-analysis.	OBJECTIVES: Wilson disease (WD) presenting as acute liver failure (ALF) is rare and typically fatal without liver transplantation (LT). Its rarity has hindered comprehensive studies. We undertook an individual patient data meta-analysis to characterize a cohort of pediatric patients presenting with ALF whose final diagnosis was WD to examine outcomes and identify predictors of poor outcomes. METHODS: Database searches were conducted in PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar, restricted to English-language articles published between January 1984 and May 2018. Articles were excluded if pediatric (<18 years old) data were not extractable or if LT was not readily available at reporting institutions. Extracted data included clinical and biochemical characteristics, genotype, treatment, and outcome. RESULTS: Data were available on 249 subjects from 52 articles, plus 7 additional subjects identified from our institution's WD database (N = 256). Females represented 69% (n = 170/245). Median age at presentation was 13.4 years (n = 204, range 4.0-17.9). Of the total 256 subjects, 87% underwent LT, 11% achieved spontaneous recovery and 2% died before LT. International normalized ratio >2.0 at presentation was a predictor of LT/death (odds ratio 7.6, 95% confidence interval 1.5-28), with a trend observed for hepatic encephalopathy (HE) (odds ratio 4.18, 95% confidence interval 0.99-18). Arithmetic diagnostic scores proved inferior in the pediatric age-bracket compared to adults. CONCLUSIONS: This large international pediatric cohort has permitted an individual patient data analysis of WD presenting as ALF. Notably, 11% of subjects achieved spontaneous survival; the rest required LT. Coagulopathy (international normalized ratio >2:0) and HE at presentation heralded poor outcomes. Further prospective studies may identify additional early predictors of outcomes.
8014805	Infectious complications in living related liver transplantation.	During the last 31 months, 50 children between 3 months and 15 years of age have undergone living related liver transplantation (LRLT) for end-stage liver diseases (39 biliary atresia, 2 Budd-Chiari syndrome, 2 progressive intrahepatic cholestasis, 3 liver cirrhosis, 1 Wilson disease, 1 protoporphyria, 1 tyrosinemia, and 1 fulminant hepatitis). Combined FK-506 and low-dose steroids were routinely used for immunosuppression. There were seven deaths, two of which were related to infection (Candida pneumonia and Epstein-Barr virus [EBV]-associated lymphoproliferative syndrome [LPS]). Five patients had a bacterial infection, all of which were associated with surgical complications. Three patients had Candida infection, all of which were malnourished, had biliary atresia, and had been managed with prolonged antibiotics against obstinate ascending cholangitis. There were 14 symptomatic viral infections (1 herpes simplex virus, 1 herpes zoster virus, 5 cytomegalovirus [CMV], 6 EBV, and 1 EBV-associated LPS). Three of the five CMV infections appeared in patients whose graft was ABO-incompatible, who were managed with prophylactic OKT-3. Most of the viral infections (except 1 EBV-associated LPS) were minor and were treated successfully. The low incidence and successful treatment of CMV infection are related to the high compatibility and low incidence of allograft rejection in LRLT. Bacterial and fungal infections can be decreased by greater refinement of surgical technique and more aggressive preoperative management. Treatment of EBV infection is still an unsolved problem.
17430479	Pediatric liver transplantation in Iran: evaluation of the first 50 cases.	LT is nowadays accepted as the definitive therapy for end-stage liver disease. We report our experiences with pediatric LT using grafts from living related and DD. From April 1999 to March 2006, 50 infants and children who underwent LT were studied for pretransplantation status, medical and surgical complications and survival rate. There were 33 (66%) boys and 17 (34%) girls. The mean age of patients was 9.9 +/- 4.8 yr (range: 0.9-17.7) with a mean weight of 33.4 +/- 18.4 kg (range: 7.5-80). The main indications were cryptogenic cirrhosis (30%), autoimmune cirrhosis (24%), followed by biliary atresia (22%), Wilson disease (14%), progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (4%), fulminant hepatitis (4%) and tyrosinemia (2%). We used living-related donor in 14 (28%) and split liver in 5 (10%) cases and other patients received whole liver from DD. The mean follow-up of patients was 24.7 +/- 22.6 months (range: 1-72). The main postoperative complications were acute cellular rejection (44%) and infections (30%), whereas chronic rejection was seen in 26% of cases. The mortality rate was 24%. Overall mean survival (76% alive) was 63.5 +/- 5.7, 95% CI: 52.3-74.6. Our results demonstrate that pediatric LT is a feasible undertaking in Iran. Organ shortage in our area led to liberal use of living related and split liver techniques. The overall results of the pediatric LT in Iran are encouraging.
14642110	[Living donor liver transplantation treatment of Wilson's disease complicated with neuropathy].	OBJECTIVE: To investigate living donor liver transplantation for Wilson disease with neurologic features. METHODS: From Jan 2001 to Mar 2003, fifteen cases of living donor liver transplantation were performed for Wilson Disease (WD), five of those were complicated with neurologic features. A retrospective analysis was given for cooper metabolism and neurologic features. RESULTS: All operation were living related liver transplantation and donors were mothers. Four left lobes with hepatic middle vein and one right lobe without hepatic middle vein were harvested from donors, and graft volume to recipient body weight ratio was 0.79 approximately 1.08. One patient occurred hepatic artery thrombosis and performed retransplantation later, the other recipients recovered satisfactorily. All patients showed Extrapyramidal sign and three patients companying with language handicap and dyskinesia alleviated postoperation follow-up between 2 and 16 months. All recipients are alive and remain well, and none have developed signs of recurrent WD. CONCLUSION: Living donor liver transplantation is effective treatment for WD complicated with nervous system symptom, ceruloplasmin is normal and Kayser-Fleischer ring and nervous system symptom are to various extents.

32008504	Effect of Liver Transplant on Neurologic Manifestations and Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging Findings in Wilson Disease.	OBJECTIVES: Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism. It leads to copper accumulation in various organs (liver, eye, brain) and deteriorates their functions. Symptoms usually appear in the second and third decades of life. Neurologic symptoms and manifestations may appear 2 to 5 years after liver involvement, and neurologic symptoms are usually movement disorders. The main treatment objective is to decrease accumulation of copper by increasing urinary copper excretion. With early diagnosis and treatment, the quality of life of patients with Wilson disease evolves. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of liver transplant on neurologic manifestations and radiologic findings in patients with Wilson disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Since 1988, our center has performed 642 liver transplant procedures. Fifty-three patients with Wilson disease received a liver transplant during this period, with 15 adults patients included in our study. All study patients were evaluated by the same neurologist and radiologist. Tremor was scored by the glass scale test. Radiologic evaluations were made by cranial magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: Before liver transplant, 4/15 study patients had tremor. In 1 patient, tremor was accompanied by dystonia; the patient's imaging findings and neurologic manifestations had regressed posttransplant. In the other 3 study patients with tremor, tremor decreased without any change in imaging findings. New-onset tremor was seen in 1 patient after liver transplant, but this patient had no observed imaging changes. This situation was correlated with immunosuppressive therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Neurologic recovery can be achieved in patients with Wilson disease with early diagnosis and treatment. Radiologic findings can be improved after therapy.
23494839	Plasma exchange for hemolytic crisis and acute liver failure in Wilson disease.	Wilson disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism which primarily involves the liver and the central nervous system. Rarely, WD can present as acute liver failure (ALF) and this disease is universally fatal in the absence of liver transplantation. The authors report a young girl with WD ALF, who showed signs of recovery after prompt initiation of plasma exchange (PE) and chelation therapy. Though liver transplantation could not be done in this child and the child died 8 d after stopping PE, this case highlights that PE can be a successful medical treatment in WD ALF and should be considered as a therapeutic measure to stabilize a patient by decreasing serum copper, reducing hemolysis, and helping to prevent renal tubular injury from copper and copper complexes until liver transplantation is possible. 
25605552	Prospective pilot study of a single daily dosage of trientine for the treatment of Wilson disease.	BACKGROUND: Wilson disease requires lifelong therapy, currently given daily in multiple divided dosages. AIM: To prospectively evaluate once-daily trientine as therapy for Wilson disease. METHODS:  STUDY GROUP: eight patients (seven males) aged 22-71 years with stable Wilson disease treated from 4 to 50 years. Patients were monitored for 3 months then for 12 months on a single daily dose of trientine (15 mg/kg). RESULTS: All patients remained clinically well. ALT and AST fluctuated in some, but none required treatment stoppages or side effects. Liver synthetic function was unchanged. Mean 24-h urine copper and zinc excretions at end of treatment were 313.4 +- 191.7 and 2,214 +- 1,346 mug, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Once-daily trientine should be explored further for possible maintenance therapy for WD. Single daily dose may improve adherence to therapy. Larger trials and longer-term follow-up will establish the safety and treatment efficacy of this once-daily treatment regimen for WD (registration: NCT01472874).
16705248	Treatment of toxic liver damage by antihepatocytotoxic serum.	Acute liver failure (ALF) is a broad term that refers to both fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) and subfulminant hepatic failure (or late-onset hepatic failure). The latter term is reserved for patients with liver disease for up to 26 weeks prior to the development of hepatic encephalopathy. Some patients with previously unrecognized chronic liver disease decompensate and present with liver failure; although this technically is not FHF, discerning this at the time of presentation may not be possible (eg, Wilson disease). The objective of present research was to define suitable method for the treatment of toxic damage of the liver. We consider that liver changes occurred in the case of toxic damage can be reversed by administration of antihepatocytotoxic serum which has been developed by us. For this purpose we are going to induce liver toxic damage in the Wister line and investigate the liver regeneration cellular mechanisms after administration of antihepatocytotoxic serum. Experimental investigations were performed on Wister line male rats, animals were divided into four equal groups. In I and II groups we were modelling acute liver failure by injections of hepatotoxic agent CCL4 (I) and performing 70% hepatectomy (II), III group was served as control group, and IV group served as donors for HPCs. The main aspect of our study was to stimulate liver reparative regeneration and by this help to organ function restoration. Performed studies have shown hypertrophy and moderate hyperplasia of hepatocyte organelles. Oval shaped HPCs were also observed, Performed investigations had shown effectiveness of our ALF treatment method in terms of damaged liver function restoration, normalization of morphological picture and biochemical measurements and we hope that administration of antihepatocytotoxic serum developed by us can give a chance to patients with acute liver failure.
26720766	Controversies and Variation in Diagnosing and Treating Children With Wilson Disease: Results of an International Survey.	OBJECTIVES: Variation in care is more common in settings in which evidence-based approaches are limited. The aims of the present study were to describe consensus and variability in approaches taken by pediatric hepatologists in the management of Wilson disease (WD) in children. METHOD: International case-centered, Internet-based survey of pediatric hepatologists. Survey cases were developed by consensus of the authors and were intended to identify variation in the care of children with WD. RESULTS: One hundred eleven of 253 clinicians responded (44%). Of these, 84% of North American and 41% of European participants used guidelines published in their respective region. Although consensus existed on the first-line diagnostic tools (serum ceruloplasmin and baseline 24-hour urinary copper excretion), survey participants did not agree on how much liver copper content was required for diagnosis: 57% considered >250 mug/g dry weight to be consistent with WD, whereas 25% considered >50 mug/g to be diagnostic. Overall, 50% of practitioners perform genetic testing in all suspected cases, and 81% perform genetic testing once they know the genotype of an index patient. For initial treatment of fulminant WD, 51% of participants chose chelation and 15% chose immediate transplantation; 47% chose listing for transplantation followed by monitoring using a disease-severity score, and then carrying out transplantation only when the score reached a critical cut-off. To treat mildly affected siblings of index patients, 43% of practitioners chose zinc. Most reported that they use chelation to treat patients with hepatic dysfunction; however, 29% of North American participants chose not to use D-penicillamine as primary therapy. CONCLUSIONS: From an international perspective, pediatric hepatologists vary in the approaches they use in the care for children with WD. Regional preferences and accessibility to treatments may generate variation. Unwarranted variation, however, may also contribute to differences in outcome and should be targeted to improve quality of care.
10632312	Hepatic decompensation in patients with cirrhosis during infection with influenza A.	BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic liver disease can develop hepatic decompensation during systemic infections. Although gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria are well recognized as causes of decompensation, the effect of influenza virus infection on patients with chronic liver disease is poorly documented. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of patients with positive viral cultures who were seen at a liver transplantation clinic in a tertiary care referral center during the 1997-1998 influenza A (H3N2) epidemic in San Diego, Calif. RESULTS: Three patients with end-stage liver disease (1 with Wilson disease and 2 with alcoholic liver disease) developed hepatic decompensation and required hospitalization during infection with influenza A. Two patients had biochemical and clinical evidence of hepatic decompensation, including ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and peripheral edema, and the third had acute hepatocellular damage, with elevated levels of aminotransferases. Viral hepatitis serologic test results, acetaminophen levels, drug and alcohol screening findings, and bacterial and fungal cultures were negative in all 3 patients. Hepatic decompensation resolved without the need for transplantation in the 2 patients with liver failure, and all patients recovered to their baseline liver function levels within 1 month of onset of acute illness. CONCLUSIONS: Influenza A infection can cause hepatic decompensation and hospitalization in patients having cirrhosis or who are awaiting liver transplantation. Effective prevention with vaccination and early recognition and treatment of influenza are strongly recommended in these individuals.
15915361	[Wilson disease].	Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder of human copper metabolism that leads to neurological symptoms and hepatic damage of variable degree. The affected gene ATP7B encodes a hepatic copper transport protein, which plays a key role in human copper metabolism. Clinical symptoms are complex with neurologic symptoms such as tremor, dysarthria, psychiatric disorders etc., predominant hepatic disease or mixed forms. Copper deposition in the liver results in acute liver failure, chronic hepatitis or liver cirrhosis. Early recognition by means of clinical, biochemical or genetic examination and early initiation of therapy with chelators or zinc-salts are essential for outcome and prognosis. Liver transplantation is an alternative in cases with acute and chronic liver failure and cures the hepatic disease. Frequent monitoring of drug therapy, adverse effects, and compliance is critical for the prognosis of the disease.
38385422	Management of Tacrolimus-Induced Toxicity With Normal Serum Levels After Liver Transplant.	Drug-induced liver injury after liver transplant occurs in 1.7% of patients. Tacrolimus is an effective immunosuppressant that is used to treat acute rejection. Although rare, it can cause toxicity, which is demonstrated by cholestatic liver injury. Here, we present a case of a young male patient who was diagnosed with Wilson disease, had penicillaminechelating therapy, and underwent living related liver transplant. Within 1 month posttransplant, he developed deranged, predominantly cholestatic pattern liver function tests. Laboratory parameters showed total bilirubin of 1.12 mg/ dL, alanine aminotransferase of 553 IU/L, gammaglutamyltransferase of 624 IU/L, and tacrolimus level of 10.2 ng/mL. After thorough evaluation, a liver biopsy was performed. Liver biopsy showed hepatocellular necrosis with centrilobular cholestasis without any evidence of graft rejection. However, with normal level of tacrolimus, the biopsy was suggestive of drug-induced liver injury. Thus, tacrolimus dose was reduced, resulting in improved liver function tests and patient discharge from the hospital. Tacrolimus is an effective immunosuppressant after liver transplant and has the ability to treat early acute rejection. The patient's liver biopsy showed hepatocellular necrosis with centrilobular cholestasis without any evidence of graft rejection. Cholestatic liver injury after tacrolimus usually resolves after dose reduction or by switching to another agent. With demonstrated tacrolimus-induced toxicity in liver transplant recipients, despite normal serum levels, transplant physicians should keep high index of suspicion regarding toxicity in the posttransplant setting.
30028785	Transplant-free Survival in Chronic Liver Disease Presenting as Acute Liver Failure in Childhood.	BACKGROUND: In adults, the absence of a preexisting chronic liver disease (CLD) is required to diagnose acute liver failure (ALF). The pediatric classification does not consider this aspect, thus previous studies pooled together children with ALF and children with unknown CLD presenting with acute hepatic decompensation (ALF-CLD). We aimed to compare prevalence, features, and outcome of children with ALF-CLD to those with a proper ALF. METHODS: Patients admitted between 1996 and 2017 because of ALF defined by Pediatric Acute Liver Failure criteria (raised transaminases, International Normal Ratio >=2.0, no history of liver disease) were classified as ALF-CLD if diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson disease, Budd-Chiari syndrome, hepatitis B virus reactivation, inborn errors of metabolism. The others were classified as ALF. RESULTS: Seventy-four children (median age, 4 years; 1.0-8.8; male/female, 36/38] with ALF were found; 18 of <1 year of age were excluded. Fifty-six (median age, 6.6 years; 2.7-11.7; male/female, 23/33], 22 with ALF-CLD (autoimmune hepatitis, n = 14; Wilson disease, n = 6; inborn errors of metabolism, n = 2) and 34 with ALF (paracetamol overdose, n = 6; viral infections, n = 3; mushroom poisoning, n = 5; indeterminate, n = 20) were compared. In ALF-CLD, the median age at onset was higher, alanine aminotransferase, albumin, and International Normal Ratio levels were lower, splenomegaly, ascites, and cirrhosis were more common (all P < 0.01). On multivariate analysis, the diagnosis of ALF-CLD was an independent predictor of transplant-free survival (P = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: In children, ALF-CLD is common, has peculiar features, and is associated with a favorable outcome. This study suggests the need to distinguish this entity from other forms of ALF in children.
9583209	Severely decompensated abdominal Wilson disease treated with peritoneal dialysis: a case report.	A 12-year-old girl with severely decompensated abdominal Wilson disease was treated with abdominal dialysis in order to accelerate the excretion of chelated copper. Dialysate without human serum albumin or D-penicillamine was used and was able to accelerate the excretion of chelated copper, with an increment of 5.5-19.7% compared with urinary excretion only.
12036681	Kayser-Fleischer ring as the presenting sign of Wilson disease.	PURPOSE: To describe a case in which the recognition by the ophthalmologist of Kayser-Fleischer rings played a crucial role in the diagnosis of Wilson disease (hepatolenticular degeneration). DESIGN: Interventional case report. METHODS: An 18-year-old woman was found to have bilateral peripheral golden brown pigment deposits at the level of the Descemet membrane consistent with Kayser-Fleischer rings. She initially denied systemic symptoms. RESULTS: The serum cerumoplasmin level of the patient was normal. Liver function tests were also normal. Further evaluations with 24-hour urine copper assay and liver biopsy were positive for Wilson disease. She underwent anticopper therapy and, 6 months later, reported improved concentration and balance. No appreciable change occurred in the Kayser-Fleischer rings. CONCLUSION: Wilson disease occurs when a defective copper-transporting enzyme in the liver results in toxic copper accumulation in multiple organs. Because of the insidious nature of the disease, patients may not seek medical attention until severe irreversible damage has occurred. By diagnosis of Kayser-Fleischer rings, ophthalmologists may play a critical role in the early recognition and proper evaluation of such patients.
17880018	Plasmapheresis for hemolytic crisis and impending acute liver failure in Wilson disease.	Wilsonian crisis is fatal unless copper removal is initiated early and liver transplantation is performed for patients that fulfill criteria for a poor outcome. We report a patient presenting with severe hemolysis and impending acute liver failure that made a rapid recovery with prompt initiation of plasmapheresis and chelation therapy. Rapid copper removal by plasmapheresis alleviated hemolysis and liver injury. A review of the literature was performed examining the use of plasmapheresis and albumin dialysis with continuous veno-venous hemodialysis or molecular adsorbents and recirculating system.
27915967	Liver Transplant Can Resolve Severe Neuropsychiatric Manifestations of Wilson Disease: A Case Report.	Although liver transplant for decompensated cirrhosis secondary to Wilson disease is well accepted, the use of transplant for patients with severe neurologic manifestations of this condition remains controversial, and these can be perceived as a contraindication. Here, we describe a 45-year-old woman who presented with an incidental hepatocellular carcinoma at the time of transplant. The patient had severe neurologic manifestations of Wilson disease pretransplant, including dysarthria, hyperreflexia, asymmetrical ataxia, tremor, bradyphrenia, and shuffling gait. She underwent successful transplant from a hepatic and surgical standpoint, but her postoperative course was marked by protracted mutism, hypophonia, and fluctuating akinesia and immobility that did not respond promptly to withdrawal of calcineurin inhibitors or pramipexole but did respond robustly to amantadine. At 9 months posttransplant, there was marked neurologic improvement, and, at 18 months, she exhibited subtle memory and organizational difficulties but was fully ambulatory and otherwise completely functional. Our experience suggests that even patients with severe neurologic Wilson disease may recover after transplant, albeit slowly, demonstrating the need for a multidisciplinary approach, including pre- and posttransplant neurologic and neuropsychiatric consultations.
4060799	[Oral zinc in Wilson disease--an alternative to D-penicillamine].	Recently Brewer et al. reported the possibility of an oral zinc therapy in Wilson's Disease. We treated a 19 years old patient with decompensated liver cirrhosis due to Wilson's disease with zinc-sulphate. D-Penicillamine had to be withdrawn since proteinuria occurred under treatment. After the discontinuation of D-Penicillamine an increase of serum copper almost up to normal range was observed; concomitantly urinary copper elimination decreased. Under oral zinc sulphate therapy (145 mg/day) a drop of serum copper level was achieved and liver function improved: serum albumin, gamma globulins and prothrombin time reached normal values. The patient did not complain any side effects during oral zinc sulphate therapy. Oral zinc therapy in Wilson's Disease may be regarded as an alternative to D-Penicillamine treatment when this drug has to be discontinued because of side effects.
28578978	Modality of treatment and potential outcome of Wilson disease in Taiwan: A population-based longitudinal study.	BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the epidemiology, the preference of medication, and the potential outcome of Wilson disease in Taiwan. We aimed to provide better therapeutic options for patients with Wilson disease based on the data generated from this study. METHODS: We utilized the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), which stores clinical records of nearly 99% of Taiwan's residents. The database used is a random sample of two-million out of 23-million beneficiaries in Taiwan's NHIRD in 2005. The integrated medical records of these two-million cases were collected from 2000 to 2011. Subjects of Wilson disease were identified as those with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) code 275.1 and the specific prescription drugs (including d-penicillamine, zinc, and trientine) in either outpatient clinic or inpatient records. RESULTS: During the study period, 66 cases of Wilson disease were identified. The male to female ratio was 1.75. The average prevalence rate was 1.81 per 100,000 and the average annual diagnosis rate was 0.22 per 100,000. The diagnosis was mostly established at 20-24 and 10-14 years of age, followed by 25-29 years. Fifty four of all subjects (81.8%) started the treatment with d-penicillamine, compared with zinc (12.1%) and trientine (6.1%). Among these 66 cases, 27 (40.9%) had liver cirrhosis and three (4.5%) underwent liver transplantation due to liver failure. CONCLUSION: d-penicillamine is still the most popular prescription of Wilson disease, followed by zinc monotherapy. Although chronic liver injury cannot be avoided, a favorable potential outcome is well demonstrated in this population-based study.
20958917	Long-term follow-up of Wilson disease: natural history, treatment, mutations analysis and phenotypic correlation.	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Wilson disease (WD) is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism. When treated, the outcome can be excellent, although the long-term survival has yet to be well documented. The aim of this study was to describe the long-term outcome of a cohort of patients with WD and to assess those factors affecting the phenotypic manifestation of WD. METHODS: The presence of mutations to the ATP7B gene, the clinical manifestations, treatments and the long-term outcomes were analysed retrospectively in 117 patients with WD (59 men and 58 women, aged at evaluation 38.5 +- 11, range 16-63 years). RESULTS: Fifty-five patients with a neurological presentation, 51 patients with a hepatic presentation and 11 asymptomatic patients were followed up for an average of 15.1 +- 10 years (median 12 years, range 1-41 years). The H1069Q ATP7B gene mutation was the most frequent genetic variant (54.3%); the frequency of this mutation did not differ between patients with either the hepatic or the neurological presentation (P = 0.099). d-penicillamine or zinc salts (81 and 17% respectively) were used for treatment, and three patients underwent liver transplantation. The majority of symptomatic patients became asymptomatic, or improved, during the follow-up (82% patients with hepatic presentation, 69% with neurological presentation). The long-term survival of patients with WD did not differ from that of the general Czech population (P = 0.95). CONCLUSIONS: Long-term follow-up shows a satisfactory response in the great majority of adequately treated patients with WD and survival coincides with that of the general population.
16549190	Tacrolimus-related neurologic and renal complications in liver transplantation: A single-center experience.	Among 71 patients, 19 (26.7%) experienced tacrolimus-related complications including 15 neurologic reactions and four problems with nephrotoxicity. Seven of these patients received grafts from cadaveric donors and 12 from living donors. Nine patients were children. The cohort included 5 female and 14 male subjects of mean age 26 +/- 20 (min 6, max 65) years. The common indications for the liver transplantation were cholestatic and metabolic diseases in pediatric patients, and viral hepatitis in adult patients. Blood tacrolimus levels were within the normal range. All patients with neurologic complications received antiepileptic therapy and drug conversion to rapamycin in 4 cases and to cyclosporine (CsA) in 11 cases. Six cases with Wilson disease and all cases with tyrosinemia experienced neurologic complications, which reversed in all but one case. In four cases with nephrotoxicity, we switched to rapamycin. Renal function improved in all cases. Patients with Wilson disease and tyrosinemia were more susceptible to the neurologic side effects of tacrolimus. In these cases we recommend the use of drugs with fewer neurologic side effects. Tacrolimus also has nephrotoxic effects, which can be reversed by converting to rapamycin.
12760731	D-penicillamine and plasmapheresis in acute liver failure secondary to Wilson's disease.	We report a case of a 19-year-old woman with acute liver failure, Coombs negative hemolytic anemia, and renal failure as initial manifestations of Wilson disease with recovery following medical treatment. The clinical picture and low serum transaminase and alkaline phosphatase levels gave us a clue to suspect Wilson disease and to initiate plasmapheresis and D-penicillamine soon after admission. The serum and urinary copper levels were elevated with low serum ceruloplasmin. We proceeded to ambulatory follow-up with medical treatment with D-penicillamine. A few months later, during the course of a laparoscopic cholecystectomy because of symptomatic gallstone disease, a liver biopsy sample was obtained that showed histological liver fibrosis and strongly elevated levels of liver tissue copper.

31113589	Acute Liver Failure due to Wilson Disease: Eight Years of the National Liver Transplant Program in Uruguay.	INTRODUCTION AND AIM: Wilson's disease (WD) is an uncommon cause of acute liver failure (ALF). Our aim was to describe clinical features, diagnostic findings, treatments, and outcomes of patients with ALF due to WD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective medical record reviews of all patients with ALF due to WD in eight years in Uruguay. RESULTS: WD was the cause of six (15%) of thirty-nine ALF cases. All patients were females, with a mean age of 18 years. Four patients presented with hyperacute liver failure and two with acute failure. Jaundice was the main complaint of all patients. Mean total bilirubin (TB), alkaline phosphatase (AP), AST, and ALT were 27.5 mg/dL, 45.5 lU/l, 156 IU/L, and 51 IU/L, respectively. Ceruloplasmin levels were low in four patients, urinary cooper was high in four, and two had Kayser-Fleischer rings. All patients had Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia, acute kidney injury, histochemical identifiable copper, and advanced fibrosis on liver histology. The average MELD score was 36. All patients were treated with d-penicillamine and listed for urgent liver transplantation (LT). Prometheus  was performed in one patient. Three patients died: two without LT and one after LT. Three patients survived: one without LT (New Wilson Index<11) and two with LT. The referral time to the program and the total time (referral plus waiting list time) were longer for non-survivors than for survivors (14 vs. 3 days and 23 vs. 8 respectively). CONCLUSION: All cases had typical clinical, analytical and histopathology characteristics. Early referral was determinant of prognosis.

28836933	Intracerebral Hemorrhage Related With Penicillium Species Following Deceased-Donor Liver Transplant.	Early or late posttransplant opportunistic infections are among the leading complications after liver transplant. The source of early posttransplant opportunistic infections is usually the patient, the implantation of an infected graft, contamination during a surgical procedure, or invasive interventions performed at the intensive care unit. A 10-year-old male patient with Wilson disease (Pediatric End-Stage Liver Disease Score of 42, Child-Pugh score of 12, total bilirubin 40 mg/dL, platelet count 55000/mL, hemoglobin level 6.3 g/dL, albumin level 1.7 g/dL, urinary copper level 4305 mu/24 h) was closely monitored in the pediatric intensive care unit of our liver transplantation center for care of a worsened general status. A deceased-donor liver transplant was performed using a right lobe liver graft (ex vivo split) obtained through the national organ sharing network. The patient developed rightward deviation of eyes and altered consciousness after the procedure and underwent cranial magnetic resonance imaging and computerized tomography examinations. The cranial magnetic resonance image, taken on the third postoperative day, revealed lesions consistent with embolic infarction, and the computed tomography scan, taken on the eighth day, showed intracerebral hemorrhage. Decompressive craniotomy, which included hematoma drainage and catheter placement, was performed. Culture and histopathologic examinations of the hematoma material revealed a Penicillium species of fungi. However, the patient died before a definitive diagnosis was made. The aim of this report is to raise awareness on early posttransplant opportunistic infections of the central nervous system presenting with intracranial hemorrhage following liver transplant.
31611120	Wilson Disease With Giant Splenic Artery Aneurysms Caused by Fibromuscular Dysplasia During Living Donor Liver Transplantation: A Case Report.	Liver cirrhosis can cause splenic artery aneurysms (SAA) that pose a threat to patients undergoing liver transplantation. However, liver transplantation with multiple visceral artery aneurysms including giant SAA caused by arterial fragility has never been reported. We describe a 36-year-old man with decompensated liver cirrhosis due to Wilson disease that was complicated by giant SAA and multiple aneurysms in the bilateral renal arteries caused by fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD). The maximal diameter of the triple snowball-shaped SAA was 11 cm. We planned a 2-stage strategy consisting of a splenectomy with distal pancreatectomy to treat the SAA and subsequent living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) to address the liver cirrhosis. This strategy was selected to prevent fatal postoperative infectious complications caused by the potential development of pancreatic fistula during simultaneous procedures and to histopathologically diagnose the arterial lesion before LDLT to promote safe hepatic artery reconstruction. However, a postoperative pancreatic fistula did not develop after a splenectomy with distal pancreatectomy, and the pathologic findings of the artery indicated FMD. The patient underwent ABO-identical LDLT with a right lobe graft donated by his brother. Other than postoperative rupture of the aneurysm in the left renal artery requiring emergency interventional radiology, the patient has remained free of any other arterial complications and continues to do well at 2 years after LDLT.

28987261	Wilson Disease: Diagnosis, Treatment, and Follow-up.	Consideration of a diagnosis of Wilson disease is still the critical factor in testing for and establishing disease diagnosis. In association with other clinical and biochemical tests, liver biopsy results and molecular genetic testing can also be used to generate a score for diagnosing Wilson disease. Medical therapy is effective for most patients; liver transplant can rescue those with acute liver failure or those with advanced liver disease who fail to respond to or discontinue medical therapy. Treatment monitoring must be done at regular intervals and includes clinical evaluation, liver tests and blood counts, and copper metabolic parameters.
27639912	[Ecchymosis as the presenting manifestation of Wilson disease: A case report].	INTRODUCTION: The presence of a psychiatric disorder during the course of an organic disease is a common cause of delayed diagnosis. CASE REPORT: We report a 16-year-old girl who was admitted with thrombocytopenia and had a two-year history of neuropsychiatric disorder which was attributed to a difficult family situation. Neurological examination showed a frontal lobe disorder and extrapyramidal manifestations. The thrombocytopenia was attributed to liver cirrhosis. These neurological and hepatic injuries were consistent with a metabolic disease, most likely Wilson disease. This was supported by the presence of a corneal Kayser-Fleischer ring and a decreased ceruloplasmin concentration. An urgent liver transplantation was required due to worsening neurological symptoms. CONCLUSION: Wilson disease is a rare genetic disease caused by copper toxicity. It is characterized by combined hepatic and neurologic damage to varying degrees and can develop at any age. Urgent treatment is required, but the diagnosis may be delayed by prevailing psychiatric symptoms.

After 4 months, liver function had dramatically improved, and the parameters characterizing copper metabolism had also normalized.
32804913	Fulminant Wilson Disease in Children: Recovery After Plasma Exchange Without Transplantation.	OBJECTIVES: Since 2005, a New Wilson Index (NWI) >=11 is used as a predictor of death without transplantation in fulminant Wilson disease (WD). Plasma exchange is advocated as a new treatment modality. METHODS: We present a patient with fulminant WD treated with plasma exchange. All published cases applying plasma exchange for fulminant WD were reviewed systematically. RESULTS: A 14-year-old girl presented with hemolysis and fulminant liver failure. She had no encephalopathy; NWI was 14. As a bridge to transplantation plasma exchange was started immediately. Complete remission was achieved with plasma exchange and later chelation therapy with D-penicillamine. She is now at 3-year transplant-free survival. Literature review identified 37 patients presenting with fulminant WD and NWI >=11 who were treated with plasma exchange. Seventeen of these patients (ie, 46%) recovered without transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple case reports and case series demonstrate transplant free survival after plasma exchange and subsequent chelation therapy, despite a NWI >=11. Plasma exchange affects the clinical course and is a therapeutic option in children and young adults presenting with fulminant WD.
9565982	[Schizophrenia-like symptoms in the Westphal-Strumpell variation of Wilson disease].	Wilson's disease is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism due to low serum ceruloplasm, resulting in increased copper deposition, especially in the liver and basal ganglia in the brain. The pseudosclerotic type of Wilson's disease, also known as the Westphal-Strumpell form, is distinguished by positional tremor, ataxia and dysarthria as the main symptoms. We use the example of a 23-year-old patient whose neurological symptoms were preceded by a long history of a schizophrenic-like disorder. Clinical symptoms are presented. MRI, SPECT and PET images are illustrated. Therapy and outcome are discussed.
24145882	Extensive striatal, cortical, and white matter brain MRI abnormalities in Wilson disease.	
21633804	[Acute Wilson disease].	Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder of human copper metabolism clinically associated with hepatic damage and/or neurological symptoms of varying degree. Copper accumulation and toxicity result in direct injury to hepatocytes followed by inflammation and irreversible impairment of neurons, mainly in the extrapyramidal system. A not insignificant number of cases begin with fulminant liver failure or acute appearance of neurological symptoms. If left untreated or in the case of delayed diagnosis and treatment, both acute manifestations may result in irreversible symptoms or even death. Rapid and exact diagnosis by means of clinical, biochemical and genetic analysis and the immediate initiation of drug therapy with copper chelators or, in the case of fulminant liver failure, orthotopic liver transplantation are essential for a favourable outcome in patients with acute Wilson disease.
37226184	Medical care of patients with Wilson disease in Germany: a multidisciplinary survey among university centers.	BACKGROUND: Wilson disease (WD) is a rare, hereditary disorder of copper metabolism. Due to its variable symptoms and manifestations, diagnosis remains challenging. Affected patients must obtain lifelong medical treatment, as the disease is fatal if untreated. Patients require continuous monitoring, but little is known about the care of these patients in Germany. Therefore, we analyzed the medical care of WD patients at German university centers. We sent a questionnaire containing 20 questions to a total of 108 departments of pediatrics, neurology and gastroenterology in 36 university hospitals. Our questions referred to the characteristics of WD patients at the different sites and internal procedures regarding diagnosis, therapy and follow-up. A descriptive statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS: Sixty-three departments (58%) returned our questionnaire. In total, approximately one-third of the estimated WD patients in Germany are seen annually in the outpatient clinics of these departments (approx. 950 patients). There are only a few departments which treat patients in a multidisciplinary setting (12%). Our survey revealed that for diagnosis, 51% of all departments used an algorithm based on the Leipzig score as recommended by international guidelines. Most departments apply essential parameters recommended by WD guidelines. Routine monitoring is performed at least biannually by 84% of the departments, and standard investigations for monitoring are regularly applied. A routine family screening is performed by 84% of all departments. A reduction in medical therapy during pregnancy is recommended by 46% of the departments. Only 14% suggested that WD patients should not breastfeed. Liver transplantation (LT) due to WD is a rare but repeatedly occurring event. Most departments of gastroenterology (72%) reported at least one patient with LT within the last decade. CONCLUSIONS: Medical care of WD patients at German university centers follows the recommendations set forth by international guidelines, but only a few centers treat significant numbers of patients. The surveillance of patients does not follow specified standards, but most departments adhere to the accepted guidelines. The formation of central units and networks in a multidisciplinary setting should be evaluated to improve the care of WD patients.
11407524	Electron microscopic detection of copper in the liver of two patients with morbus Wilson by EELS and EDX.	A 20-year-old male patient with morbus Wilson was liver transplanted because of terminal failure of liver function. The explanted liver showed a strong macronodular cirrhosis as typically seen in Wilson disease. There were visible granular accumulations in the hepatocytes after the rubeanic acid or rhodanine method for histochemical detection of copper. The electron microscopic studies on ultrathin sections revealed numerous electron-dense lysosomes and residual bodies. The elemental analysis in transmission electron microscope (TEM) with electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and in scanning electron microscope (SEM) with energy dispersive x-ray analysis (EDX) showed copper-specific signals of electron-dense accumulations inside these dark lysosomes and residual bodies. In a second case, Wilson disease was diagnosed after autopsy of a 31-year-old patient by liver electron microscopy and EELS; strong electron-dense lysosomes and residual bodies with positive copper signals were found inside hepatocytes. For negative control, hepatocytes with iron accumulation after idiopathic hemochromatosis and liver cirrhosis were also analyzed by EELS in TEM, which showed strong iron, but only a few or no copper signals. Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) in 16 liver samples of healthy and cirrhotic liver revealed only in both cases of Wilson disease a strong increased copper concentration higher than 100 microg Cu/g. The electron microscopic detection of copper-containing hepatocytic lysosomes is helpful for the diagnosis of early stages of Wilson disease in addition to the quantification of hepatic copper by AAS.

36872503	Motor Evoked Potentials in Newly Diagnosed and Treated Patients With Wilson Disease.	PURPOSE: To investigate whether patients with Wilson disease have abnormal motor evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation. METHODS: In a prospective, observational, single-center study, transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to examine MEPs recorded from the abductor digiti minimi in 24 newly diagnosed treatment-naive patients and 21 treated patients with Wilson disease. RESULTS: Motor evoked potentials were recorded in 22 (91.7%) newly diagnosed treatment-naive patients and in 20 (95.2%) treated patients. Abnormal MEP parameters were found in a similar proportion of newly diagnosed and treated patients: MEP latency (38% vs. 29%), MEP amplitude (21% vs. 24%), central motor conduction time (29% vs. 29%), and resting motor threshold (68% vs. 52%). Abnormal MEP amplitude (P = 0.044) and resting motor threshold (P = 0.011) were more frequent in treated patients with brain MRI abnormalities but not in newly diagnosed patients. We did not observe significant improvement in MEPs parameters after 1 year of treatment introduction in eight examined patients. However, in one patient where MEPs were initially nondetectable, they were present 1 year after treatment introduction with zinc sulfate, although MEPs were not in the normal range. CONCLUSIONS: Motor evoked potential parameters did not differ between newly diagnosed and treated patients. There was no significant improvement in MEP parameters one year after treatment introduction. Further studies conducted on large cohorts are necessary to determine the usefulness of MEPs in detecting pyramidal tract damage and improvement after anticopper treatment introduction in Wilson disease.
23188863	Is blinking of the eyes affected in extrapyramidal disorders? An interesting observation in a patient with Wilson disease.	Blinking of eye is a routine human activity which seldom attracts any attention of clinicians in health and disease. There is experimental evidence that blink rate is affected in extrapyramidal disorders affecting the balance of these neurotransmitters. However, no observations regarding blink rate in Wilson disease (WD) have been reported previously. We report a patient of WD with an increased spontaneous blink rate. A 24-year-old lady presented complaining of tremulousness of both upper limbs and head for 2 years, dysphagia and difficulty in speaking for 1.5 years and abnormal behaviour for last 1 year. We observed that her blink rate at rest was 32/min. Serum ceruloplasmin level was low (0.08 g/l). The patient was started on therapy with D-penicillamine, zinc sulphate, levodopa-carbidopa and trihexiphenidyl. At 1-month follow-up, patient's tremors were markedly decreased and blink rate at rest was decreased to 12/min.

34608110	Wilson Disease in Children; Chelation Therapy or Liver Transplantation? A 10-Year Experience from Pakistan.	BACKGROUND Wilson disease (WD) is a rare genetic disorder with vast clinical presentations and a higher incidence in areas where consanguinity is common. Most patients can be treated with oral chelation, but some require advanced surgical intervention, like liver transplantation (LT). This study aims to review outcomes of WD patients presenting to a tertiary care center over a period of 10 years. MATERIAL AND METHODS This retrospective analysis was conducted at Shifa International Hospital, Islamabad, Pakistan. Patients <18 years who were diagnosed with WD per ESPAGHAN guidelines from 2010 to 2020 were included. Presentation, diagnosis, treatment, and LT and its complications were recorded. Follow-ups were recorded, and patients were contacted by phone in cases of interrupted follow-up. Frequencies and percentages of variables were calculated. RESULTS A total of 48 patients with WD were identified. Symptomatic disease was seen in 45 patients, with 3 diagnosed on screening. The hepatic form was common (62.2%). Mean age at diagnosis was 9.74 (range 5-17) years, 28 (58.3%) were male, while 17 (35.4%) were female. Urinary copper was increased in all patients (645.82+-528.40). Oral treatment with penicillamine was given to 34 (75.5%) patients; 4 (8.9%) died while on oral treatment. Living donor LT was performed in 11 (22.9%) patients, who had a mean King's Wilson index of 11 (range, 6-14). Currently, all LT patients are alive, with maximum graft survival of 7 years. CONCLUSIONS LT offers a promising treatment with good outcomes in pediatric WD. However, timely diagnosis and management with oral chelation therapy can prolong survival without LT.
31169307	The dilemma to diagnose Wilson disease by genetic testing alone.	BACKGROUND: Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of hepatic copper excretion. About sixty per cent of patients present with liver disease. WD is considered a fatal disease if undiagnosed and/or untreated but recent data indicate that disease penetrance may not be 100%. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients underwent liver biopsy as part of the diagnostic workup. Genetic testing for ATP7B was performed by Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: We report on a large family with multiple affected siblings. The first patient (male, 31 years) underwent orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) because of fulminant WD. He was homozygous for p.G710A. One asymptomatic brother (37 years) had the same mutation. He is doing well on chelation therapy. Fifteen years later, a second-degree sibling (female, 16 years) presented with fulminant WD and underwent OLT. She was compound heterozygote (p.G710A/p.G710S). Further family screening revealed a third mutation (p.V536A) in a female (21 years) and male (16 years) compound-heterozygote sibling (p.G710A/p.V536A). In both, serum ceruloplasmin and 24-hour urinary copper excretion were normal. Liver biopsy showed normal histology and a quantitative hepatic copper content within the normal range or only slightly elevated (19 and 75 mug/g dry weight, respectively). No decoppering treatment was initiated so far. CONCLUSION: Genetic testing alone is not always sufficient to diagnose WD in asymptomatic patients, and human mutation databases should be used with caution. Even patients carrying two disease-causing mutations do not necessarily have demonstrable alteration of copper metabolism. Asymptomatic siblings diagnosed by genetic screening require further testing before initiating treatment.
27759555	Effect of Copper Staining in Wilson Disease: A Liver Explant Study.	OBJECTIVES: Wilson disease is a rare genetic disease with clinical and histopathologic differential diagnostic challenges. In this study, we evaluated the histopathologic findings of explanted livers in Wilson disease, with special emphasis on copper histochemistry. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our study group was recruited by reviewing archived histopathology reports and the liver transplant clinic patient records retrospectively for patients who had liver transplant for Wilson disease between January 2010 and June 2015, at Turgut Ozal Medical Center. Archival slides were reevaluated. When needed, relevant clinical and laboratory data were obtained from patient medical records. RESULTS: During the selected period, there were 33 patients fitting the study criteria (22 male, 11 female, mean age of 22 +- 11 y). All patients had mild to moderate septal inflammation. We found that 29 patients (88%) showed glycogenated hepatocyte nuclei and 27 patients (79%) showed nuclear pleomorphism. Other histopathologic findings were cholestasis (48%) and macrovesicular steatosis (39%). There was no special finding in hilar regions except for 2 patients who had recanalized portal vein thrombosis. In terms of copper histochemistry, 2 copper stains, Timm silver sulfide and rhodanine, were performed in all cases, with orcein staining only done for 25 of the cases. Positivity rates for these copper stains were 85%, 82%, and 36%. Periodic acid-Schiff-diastase- and periodic acid-Schiff-positive granules were detected in 7 of 33 patients (21%). Iron deposition was seen in 12 patients (focal and/or minimal in 11, more than focal in 1). There was no dysplasia or malignancy in any of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: On routine hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides, detection of glycogenated hepatocyte nuclei and the finding of the nuclear pleomorphism should alert the pathologist for the possibility of Wilson disease, especially with cryptogenic liver disease. Timm stain is a more convenient histochemical stain in revealing copper deposition in liver.
7212664	Brainstem auditory evoked responses in spinocerebellar degeneration and Wilson disease.	Brainstem auditory evoked responses (BAERs) were studied in 30 healthy subjects, 20 patients with spinocerebellar degeneration (SCD), and 6 patients with Wilson's disease. In addition to the standard 8 click per second stimulation rate, increased stimulation frequency was applied which identified wave V for its stability under different stimulation rates. No prolongation of wave latencies was noted in SCD patients, irrespective of clinical features, except in 1 patient who had a latency slightly above the normal range. Wilson disease with neurological symptoms produced prolongation of wave latencies in every case, whereas the patients without neurological involvement showed a normal BAER pattern.
15984949	Severe hypogammaglobulinemia associated with hepatic vein stenosis causes cytomegalovirus infection after living-related liver transplantation.	Hepatic vein stenosis is a vascular complication that can lead to graft loss after liver transplantation. Although ascites frequently occurs as a symptom of hepatic vein stenosis, the development of severe hypogammaglobulinemia associated with hepatic vein stenosis has not been reported in the literature. An 8-year-old boy underwent living-related liver transplantation (LRLT) because of Wilson disease with chronic hepatic failure. Because de novo autoimmune hepatitis was diagnosed 1 year after LRLT, azathioprine, and prednisolone were added to the baseline immunosuppression of tacrolimus. The patient developed ascites with severe hypogammaglobulinemia (immunoglobulin G [IgG], 288 mg/dL) 2 years after LRLT. Ultrasonography and angiography disclosed stenosis of the hepatic vein. The ascites completely resolved after percutaneous balloon angioplasty. Despite serum IgG trough levels of >500 mg/dL maintained by the addition of immunoglobulin, cytomegalovirus reactivation and sepsis occurred. Serum IgG levels should be monitored to prevent opportunistic infections when hepatic vein stenosis is diagnosed after LRLT.
18821595	Rapid diagnosis of Wilson disease in acute liver failure: no more waiting for the ceruloplasmin level?	
12508671	[Rare, but important chronic liver diseases].	The presence of steatosis and inflammatory infiltrate in liver biopsies is essential for the diagnosis of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). These findings are similar to those with alcoholic liver disease. However, in the NASH-situation alcohol doesn't play an important role. Risk factors for the development of NASH are obesity and diabetes. Most of the patients are clinically asymptomatic. This means, that a diagnosis of NASH is a diagnosis of exclusion: Viral induced, autoimmune, metabolic and toxic liver disease have to be excluded. The disease has a benign clinical course. The risk of cirrhosis is low. So far, there is no established treatment. Preliminary reports suggest a positive effect of weight-loss and ursodeoxycholic acid. Wilson's disease, a copper storage disorder, in which biliary copper excretion is reduced, is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Most patients with Wilson disease become symptomatic between the ages of 6 and 15. In about 90% of patients serum ceruloplasmin levels and serum copper concentrations are reduced. Copper excreation is increased. Histologic examination of liver biopsy specimens reveals fatty infiltration, Mallory bodies and ballooned glycogen nuclei, abnormalities which are also found in alcoholic liver disease. The definitive diagnostic parameter is the quantitative determination of liver copper content (> 250 micrograms/g dryweight). Untreated Wilson disease is always fatal. Lifelong treatment with anti-copper drugs are essential, D-penicillamine being the firstline therapy. Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is an iron overload disease inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. The frequency of the disease is high. The first symptoms usually can be found at the age of 20-50 years. Arthralgia develops in up to 50% of the patients. Many organs are involved, most often the liver. The organ is usually enlarged, transaminases are always moderately elevated. Laboratory findings disclose a marked elevation in serum ferritin and transferrin saturation. More than 80% of HH-patients are homozygous for the C282Y-mutation in the HFE-gene. The firstline treatment of HH is phlebotomy. Treatment is lifelong. When serum ferritin drops below 50 micrograms/l, the frequency of phlebotomy should be reduced (4-12 per year). If the patient already has cirrhosis, the risk of HCC is very high.
30541745	FDA Approval Summary: (Daunorubicin and Cytarabine) Liposome for Injection for the Treatment of Adults with High-Risk Acute Myeloid Leukemia.	"On August 3, 2017, the FDA granted regular approval to Vyxeos (also known as CPX-351; Jazz Pharmaceuticals), a liposomal formulation of daunorubicin and cytarabine in a fixed combination, for the treatment of adults with newly diagnosed therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MRC). Approval was based on data from Study CLTR0310-301, a randomized, multicenter, open-label, active-controlled trial comparing Vyxeos with a standard combination of daunorubicin and cytarabine (""7+3"") in 309 patients 60-75 years of age with newly diagnosed t-AML or AML-MRC. Because of elemental copper concerns with the Vyxeos formulation, patients with Wilson disease were excluded from the study. Vyxeos demonstrated an improvement in overall survival (HR 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.52-0.90; P = 0.005) with an estimated median overall survival of 9.6 months compared with 5.9 months for the ""7+3"" control arm. The toxicity profile of Vyxeos was similar to that seen with standard ""7+3"" with the exception of more prolonged neutropenia and thrombocytopenia on the Vyxeos arm. Because the pharmacology of Vyxeos differs from that of other formulations of daunorubicin and cytarabine, labeling includes a warning against interchanging formulations during treatment. This is the first FDA-approved treatment specifically for patients with t-AML or AML-MRC."
26224517	Role of Oxidative Stress in the Worsening of Neurologic Wilson Disease Following Chelating Therapy.	Patients with neurologic Wilson disease (NWD) may worsen on treatment, but there is no study evaluating the role of oxidative stress. We report the role of plasma glutathione (GSH), total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in the worsening of NWD following treatment. Fifty-one treatment-naive NWD patients were subjected to detailed clinical evaluation. The severity of NWD was noted, and dystonia was measured by Burke-Fahn-Marsden (BFM) score. Their hematological, serum chemistry, ultrasound abdomen and cranial MRI changes were noted. Plasma GSH, TAC and MDA, serum free copper (Cu) and 24-h urinary Cu were measured at admission and at 3 and 6 months after treatment. The patients were considered worsened if there was one or more grade deterioration in severity scale, >10 % deterioration in BFM score or appearance of new neurologic signs. The median age of the patients was 11 (5-37) years, and 12 were females. Following treatment, 25 patients improved, 12 worsened, and 14 had stationary course. The worsened group at 3 months had lower GSH (1.99 +- 0.17 vs. 2.30 +- 0.30 mg/dl; P = 0.004) and TAC (1.59 +- 0.12 vs. 1.82 +- 0.17 mmol Trolox equivalent/L; P = 0.001) and higher MDA (5.24 +- 0.22 vs. 4.34 +- 0.46 nmol/ml; P < 0.001) levels compared to the improved group. These changes were associated with increased serum free Cu (41.81 +- 3.31 vs. 35.62 +- 6.40 microg/dl; P = 0.02) and 24-h urinary Cu (206.42 +- 41.61 vs. 121.99 +- 23.72 microg/24 h; P < 0.001) in the worsened compared to the improved group. All the patients having worsening were on penicillamine. Worsening following chelating treatment in NWD may be due to oxidative stress which is induced by increased serum free Cu. These results may have future therapeutic implication and needs further study.
20818742	Recurrent liver failure in a 25-year-old female.	Acute liver failure (ALF) is defined as severe and sudden liver dysfunction leading to coagulopathy and encephalopathy in a previously healthy person without preexisting liver disease. Almost half of adult cases of ALF are due to acetaminophen toxicity, with 21% labeled indeterminate or other. We present a patient with a second episode of ALF, both episodes being initiated by catabolic stress. Elevated aminotransferases, jaundice, an elevated international normalized ratio, and confusion were typical of idiopathic ALF, and a low serum ceruloplasmin level initially led to a misdiagnosis of acute Wilson disease. Citrullinemia type I, a urea cycle defect caused by a deficiency of argininosuccinate synthetase, was diagnosed on the basis of plasma amino acids and was confirmed by molecular testing. Urea cycle defects are not generally considered causes of ALF in adults and are described rarely in children beyond the neonatal period. Our case illustrates the importance of screening patients with idiopathic ALF for a metabolic disorder. A prompt diagnosis and timely treatment enabled her to recover fully without the need for liver transplantation.
29449431	Wilson disease: more than meets the eye.	Wilson disease is a rare but important disorder of copper metabolism, with a failure to excrete copper appropriately into bile. It is a multisystem condition with presentations across all branches of medicine. Diagnosis can be difficult and requires a high index of suspicion. It should be considered in unexplained liver disease particularly where neuropsychiatric features are also present. Treatments are available for all stages of disease. A particularly important presentation not to overlook is acute liver failure which carries a high mortality risk and may require urgent liver transplantation. Here, we provide an overview of this complex condition.
3275696	Improvement of cerebral CT abnormalities following liver transplantation in a patient with Wilson disease.	Cerebral CT performed in patients with Wilson disease (hepatolenticular degeneration) often reveals abnormalities of the putamen, globus pallidus, thalamocapsular region, cerebral cortex, dentate nucleus, and brain stem. We report a patient with Wilson disease who demonstrated rapid reversal of CT abnormalities following orthotopic liver transplantation.
32291276	Wilson Disease With Novel Compound Heterozygote Mutations in the ATP7B Gene Presenting With Severe Diabetes.	OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between ATP7B mutations and diabetes in Wilson disease (WD). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 21 exons and exon-intron boundaries of ATP7B were identified by Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: Two novel compound heterozygous mutations (c.525 dupA/ Val176Serfs*28 and c.2930 C>T/ p.Thr977Met) were detected in ATP7B. After d-penicillamine (D-PCA) therapy, serum aminotransferase and ceruloplasmin levels in this patient were normalized and levels of HbA1c decreased. However, when the patient ceased to use D-PCA due to an itchy skin, serum levels of fasting blood glucose increased. Dimercaptosuccinic acid capsules were prescribed and memory recovered to some extent, which was accompanied by decreased insulin dosage for glucose control by 5 units. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of diabetes caused by WD.
19198096	[Diagnosis and treatment of dystonia].	Diagnosis of dystonia is not difficult by recognizing the pattern of clinical presentation. Dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD) and Wilson disease are important in differential diagnosis because of their specific treatment. The most common are the focal dystonias, including blepharospasm and spasmodic torticollis. Dystonia comprises mobile involuntary movements and abnormal postures, the latter is better described as hypokinetic disorder. The pathogenesis of dystonia is now being clarified, and includes abnormal neuroplasticity caused by the relative excess of dopamine in the matrix compartment of the striatum, the possible primary lesion being the striosome. In a dopa-responsive dystonia model, dopaminergic projection is more deficient to the striosome than to the matrix, which could produce imbalance between the direct versus. indirect pathway activities. The treatment options include trihexyphenidyl, minor tranquilizers, botulinum toxin injection, and deep brain stimulation.
31878905	The study of Wilson disease in pregnancy management.	INTRODUCTION: Pregnancy management in women with Wilson disease (WD) remains an important clinical problem. This research was conducted to investigate how to avoid worsening of WD symptoms during pregnancy and increase pregnancy success in women with WD by identifying the best pregnancy management approaches in these patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The clinical data of 117 pregnancies among 75 women with WD were retrospectively analyzed. Related information of the fetus was also recorded and analyzed. At the same time, regression analysis was performed for data of 22 pregnant women without WD, as normal controls. RESULTS: Of a total of 117 pregnancies among the 75 women with WD and 31 pregnancies among the 22 control womenincluded in this study, there were 108 successful pregnancies and 9 spontaneous abortions. Among the 108 successful pregnancies, 97 women a history of copper chelation therapy before pregnancy; all 97 women stopped anti-copper therapy during pregnancy. The nine women with spontaneous abortion had no pre-pregnancy history of copper displacement therapy. The incidence of lower limb edema was higher in the WD group than in normal controls (P = 0.036). Compared with the control group, there was a higher proportion in the WD group of male infants (P = 0.022) and lower average infant birth weight (t = 3.514, P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: It is relatively safe for women with WD patients to become pregnant. The best management method for pregnancy in women with WD may be intensive pre-pregnancy copper chelation therapy and no anti-copper treatment during pregnancy.
33368534	Ninety days transplant free survival with high volume plasma exchange in Wilson disease presenting as acute liver failure.	OBJECTIVE: To study the efficacy and safety of high volume plasma exchange (HVPE) in Wilson disease presenting as acute liver failure (WD-ALF). METHODS: An analysis of prospectively collected data of consecutively admitted WD-ALF cases was done and patients were divided into two groups: (i) high volume plasma exchange (HVPE) group- who received HVPE + standard medical therapy (SMT), and (ii) SMT group- received only SMT. Outcome measure was transplant free survival (TFS) at 90 days post enrollment, change in biochemical, hemodynamic parameters & incidence of organ dysfunction in HVPE as compared to SMT group, and HVPE related complications. RESULTS: Out of the total 43 cases of WD-ALF reported in the study period, 37 were enrolled (median age 9 years, 62.2% males). All biochemical parameters and prognostic indices except blood ammonia and serum creatinine improved significantly at 72 to 96 hours after enrollment in the HVPE group. Overall, TFS at 90 days was present in 9/19 (47.3%) in HVPE group vs 3/18 (16.6%) in the SMT group (OR 2.84, 95% CI 0.91-8.8, P = .049). Kaplan Meier survival analysis revealed that HVPE group had significantly higher cumulative survival as per the Log Rank test (P = .027); median days of survival was 38 days (IQR 12-63) in HVPE group vs 14 (IQR 5-22) days in SMT group. CONCLUSIONS: The present study indicates that in children with WD-ALF, HVPE not only acts as a bridging therapy to LT but may also improve proportion of the cases with TFS.
29417175	The steady state pharmacokinetics of trientine in Wilson disease patients.	PURPOSE: To determine the steady state pharmacokinetics of trientine in children (>= 12 years of age) and adult patients who had been receiving trientine dihydrochloride therapy prior to the study. METHODS: Twenty patients were exposed to trientine (trientine dihydrochloride capsules supplied by Univar) after standard oral dosing as part of ongoing therapy. Plasma trientine concentration was determined pre-dose and at 30 min, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 12 h post-dose. Concentrations of trientine in plasma were determined by LC-MS/MS using a validated bioanalytical method with stable labelled trientine as the internal standard. RESULTS: Trientine was generally absorbed fairly rapidly with a median Tmax of 1.49 h (range, 0.48-4.08 h). There was some variability in exposure, with a 10-fold range in Cmax, and a 13.8-fold range in AUC0-t. This variability was slightly lower when PK parameters were dose-normalised (6.7-fold range in Cmax/D and an 11.6-fold range in AUC0-t/D). The terminal half-life, which could be defined in 14 of the 20 patients, was broadly consistent between patients (range of 2.33 to 6.99 h). There was no marked difference in pharmacokinetics between adult patients (n = 16) and children (n = 4). The Cmax range was 506 to 3100 ng/mL in adults and 309 to 1940 ng/mL in children-the equivalent ranges for AUC0-t were 1240 to 17,100 ng/mL h and 1500 to 8060 ng/mL h. When PK parameters were normalised for administered dose, the Cmax/D and AUC0-t/D for children were contained within the ranges for the adult patients. CONCLUSIONS: The steady state pharmacokinetics of trientine in Wilson disease patients were broadly similar to that reported in healthy subjects.
21813384	Efficacy of liver transplantation for acute hepatic failure: a single-center experience.	BACKGROUND: Acute hepatic failure (AHF) is a devastating clinical syndrome with a high mortality rate. The outcome of AHF varies with etiology, but liver transplantation (LT) can significantly improve the prognosis and survival rate of such patients. This study aimed to detect the role of LT and artificial liver support systems (ALSS) for AHF patients and to analyze the etiology and outcome of patients with this disease. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was made of 48 consecutive patients with AHF who fulfilled the Kings College Criteria for LT at our center. We analyzed and compared the etiology, outcome, prognosis, and survival rates of patients between the transplantation (LT) group and the non-transplantation (N-LT) group. RESULTS: AHF was due to viral hepatitis in 25 patients (52.1%; hepatitis B virus in 22), drug or toxic reactions in 14 (29.2%; acetaminophen in 6), Wilson disease in 4 (8.3%), unknown reasons in 3 (6.3%), and miscellaneous conditions in 2 (4.2%). In the LT group, 36 patients (7 underwent living donor LT, and 29 cadaveric LT) had an average model for end-stage liver disease score (MELD) of 35.7. Twenty-eight patients survived with good graft function after a follow-up of 27.3+/-4.5 months. During the waiting time, 6 patients were treated with ALSS and 2 of them died during hospitalization. The 30-day, 12-month, and 18-month survival rates were 77.8%, 72.2%, and 66.7%, respectively. In the N-LT group, 12 patients had an average MELD score of 34.5. Four patients were treated with ALSS and all died during hospitalization. The 90-day and 1-year survival rates were only 16.7% and 8.3%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Hepatitis is the most prominent cause of AHF at our center. Most patients with AHF, who fulfill the Kings College Criteria for LT, did not survive longer without LT. ALSS did not improve the prognosis of AHF patients, but may extend the waiting time for a donor. Currently, LT is still the most effective way to improve the prognosis of AHF patients.
18299897	Single pass albumin dialysis (SPAD) in fulminant Wilsonian liver failure: a case report.	Since fulminant Wilsonian liver failure has an extremely poor prognosis, the use of a liver support system that can bridge patients to liver transplant is life saving. We report here the case of a 17-year-old female who presented with fulminant Wilsonian liver failure and intravascular hemolysis. With the subsequent development of encephalopathy and oliguria, single pass albumin dialysis (SPAD) was initiated for 5 days to augment copper removal. Continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVHD) was performed using the PRISMA machine, with a blood flow of 100 ml/min and a dialysate flow of 2 L/h for 8 h, then 1 L/h. A 5% albumin dialysate was made by exchanging 1 L of 25% albumin for 1 L of Hemosol BO in a 5-L bag. Single pass albumin dialysis resulted in reductions in serum copper (154 to 59 microg/dL), conjugated bilirubin (37 to 23 mg/dL), lactate dehydrogenase (1305 to 729 units/L), and creatinine (1.1 to 0.9 mg/dL) as well as reduced blood transfusion requirements. Cessation of SPAD was followed by three plasmapheresis treatments for further copper removal. We conclude that SPAD is potentially an effective treatment in fulminant Wilson disease with hemolysis but that it should be used in combination with chelation to optimize the removal of copper.
26481962	Delay in Diagnosis of Wilson Disease in Children With Insidious Psychiatric Symptoms: A Case Report and Review of the Literature.	
24118554	Outcome and development of symptoms after orthotopic liver transplantation for Wilson disease.	BACKGROUND: Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive copper storage disease resulting in hepatic and neurologic dysfunction. Liver transplantation is an effective treatment for fulminant cases for patients with chronic liver disease. Reports on the outcome of neuropsychiatric symptoms after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) are limited. AIM: To assess the course of neuropsychiatric and hepatic symptoms after liver transplantation for Wilson disease METHODS: Nineteen patients with Wilson disease received liver transplantation and were followed prospectively from 2005 to 2010 for the development of hepatic, neurological and psychiatric symptoms. RESULTS: Eight patients (all female) were transplanted for acute liver failure and eleven patients for chronic liver failure. Patient survival rates one and five yr after transplantation were 78% and 65%, respectively. Of the surviving patients, hepatic symptom scores improved in all patients and neurological symptom scores improved in all but one patient after OLT compared to the time of initial diagnosis and compared to pre-OLT status. Psychiatric symptoms showed moderate improvements. CONCLUSION: Survival after OLT for Wilson disease with end-stage liver disease is excellent. Overall, neuropsychiatric symptoms improved after transplantation, substantiating arguments for widening of the indication for liver transplantation in symptomatic neurologic Wilson disease patients with stable liver function.
10714666	Effect of liver transplantation on neurological manifestations in Wilson disease.	BACKGROUND: Liver transplantation (LT) is the sole resolutive therapy for Wilson disease (WD) and is the treatment of choice for patients with WD who have fulminant hepatic failure or end-stage cirrhosis. Although its role in managing the neurological manifestations of WD is not yet conclusive, LT has recently been advocated as a therapy for neurologically affected patients with WD with stable liver function. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of LT on the neurological manifestations of WD. OBSERVATION: A 44-year-old man with WD with cirrhosis and neurological symptoms (motor dysfunction and cognitive impairment) experienced a dramatic improvement in motor function early after LT, as well as normalization of copper balance and the disappearance of Kayser-Fleischer rings. Abnormalities seen on magnetic resonance imaging scans were reversed 18 months after LT. Cognitive testing 2 years after LT showed a moderate global improvement. CONCLUSIONS: In this case, LT healed the neurological manifestations of WD. To date, this favorable result has been seen in almost 80% of cases. However, the decision to perform LT in patients with WD solely on the basis of neurological impairment must be considered experimental.
29527989	Complications of Liver Transplant in Adult Patients With the Hepatic Form of Wilson Disease.	OBJECTIVES: Wilson disease is an autosomal, recessive, inherited disorder of copper metabolism that results in the accumulation of copper in many organs and tissues. This disease is mainly characterized by dysfunction due to copper accumulation in the liver, kidney, brain, cornea, bone, heart, and blood cells. The clinical spectrum is broad in Wilson disease. Asymptomatic Wilson disease may be present, but findings related to the involvement of an individual organ or multiple organ failure can be seen. These findings can include neurologic and neuropsychiatric complications. Our aim here was to examine the neurologic complications and our clinical experience in patients who underwent liver transplant for Wilson disease in our clinic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of transplant patients with Wilson disease who were seen at Baskent University Faculty of Medicine Transplantation Science between 2005 and 2017. Patient demographics, neurologic complaints, findings from neurologic examinations, and imaging findings were recorded. We also recorded the presence of the Kayser-Fleischer ring, serum ceruloplasmin, 24-hour copper urine levels, and levels of dry copper in liver in each patient. RESULTS: Our study included 19 patients who ranged in age range from 18 to 44 years (mean age of 26 years). Seven of 19 patients (36.8%) had neurologic symptoms, including epileptic seizures in 2 patients (10.5%), encephalopathy in 1 patient (5.2%), tremor in 3 patients (15.7%), and headache in 1 patient (5.2%). The cause of these long-term neurologic complications was the immunosuppressive drugs. Patients with epileptic seizures were provided with seizure control medication (levetiracetam). Tremor did not need treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In Wilson disease, neurologic complications can be severe. The most common complication seen in our patients was tremor. Early diagnosis and treatment may slow down neurologic disability.
34144249	Characteristics and outcomes of hospitalized patients with Wilson's disease in the United States: A national survey.	INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by excessive copper disposition predominantly in the liver and brain. Hospitalization data on patients with WD are scarce. Hence, we sought to examine the inpatient characteristics and outcomes of patients with WD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We utilized the National Inpatient Database (2006-2011) and analyzed all adult patients with a diagnosis of WD. RESULTS: There were 9046 hospitalizations during the study period. The leading etiologies for admissions were chronic liver disease (8.58%), WD (6.49%) and infections (septicemia 3.10% and pneumonia 2.50%). The overall inpatient mortality rate for WD patients was 2.58%. Independent predictors of mortality in WD patients were acute respiratory failure (OR: 4.53; 95% CI: 2.44-8.42), acute renal failure (OR: 4.09; 95% CI: 2.19-7.65), decompensated liver disease or liver failure (OR: 3.37; 95% CI: 1.72-6.59), and advanced age (every 10 year increase, OR: 1.48; 95% CI: 1.25-1.75). Propensity-score matched analysis revealed better inpatient survival in WD patients compared to matched non-WD patients (2.84% vs. 4.67%, p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated the clinical characteristics and outcomes of hospitalized patients with WD. These findings add important knowledge to our understanding of the healthcare utilization and outcomes of this rare disease in the United States.

27350316	Pregnancy outcome after chelation therapy in Wilson disease. Evaluation of the German Embryotox Database.	Continuation of treatment is recommended for pregnant women with Wilson disease. Therapy options include the copper chelating agents d-penicillamine and trientine. However, there are still uncertainties concerning a possible teratogenic risk. In this case series, we report on the outcome of 20 pregnancies with maternal chelator exposure at least during the first trimester. Of these 20 pregnancies documented by the German Embryotox Project, 14 were prospectively ascertained and 6 were retrospective. No major birth defects were observed. Three of the 14 prospective cases resulted in a spontaneous abortion, and one pregnancy was electively terminated. Our results do not support the hypothesis of teratogenicity based on earlier case reports of congenital anomalies. Therefore our study may contribute to reassure women needing chelation therapy during pregnancy. However, it must be taken into account that the sample size of this case series is too limited to make final conclusions on teratogenic effects.
30879594	Rendezvous Technique Using Double Balloon Endoscope for Removal of Multiple Intrahepatic Bile Duct Stones in Hepaticojejunostomy After Living Donor Liver Transplant: A Case Report.	Cholangitis is a major complication following transplantation. We report a living donor liver transplant (LDLT) patient with cholangitis due to multiple stones in the intrahepatic bile duct during hepaticojejunostomy anastomosis, who was successfully treated with the rendezvous technique using double balloon endoscope. A 64-year-old woman underwent LDLT with right lobe graft and hepaticojejunostomy for Wilson disease. There was bile leakage with biliary peritonitis, which was treated conservatively after transplant. Two years after surgery, she developed reiterated cholangitis due to stenosis of hepaticojejunostomy anastomosis and multiple stones in the intrahepatic bile ducts. Percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage was performed. The size of the drainage tube was increased, and the anastomotic area was dilated in a stepwise manner using a balloon catheter. The stones were crushed and lithotomy was performed using electronic hydraulic lithotripsy through cholangioscopy. Finally, lithotomy was performed for the remaining stones through endoscopic retrograde cholangiography with the rendezvous technique using the double balloon endoscope. Rendezvous approach with percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage and double balloon endoscopic retrograde cholangiography was an effective treatment for the multiple intrahepatic stones in hepaticojejunostomy following LDLT with right lobe graft.

18226344	[Piggy-back liver transplantation in treating acute liver failure patients: a report of 15 cases].	OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical significance of piggy-back liver transplantation in treating acute liver failure (ALF). METHODS: Fifteen ALF patients (13 caused by HBV and 2 with acute Wilson disease) had piggy-back liver transplantations (PBLT) in our hospital from Sept 1999 to Feb 2006. The outcomes of these patients were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: One year survival rate of the 15 patients was 87% (13/15). Excellent outcome was achieved in the 2 acute Wilson disease cases: their corneal Kayser-Fleischer rings disappeared and serum ceruloplasmin levels returned to normal. Among the 15 cases, one died of severe pulmonary infection and another died of multiple organ system failure on the 6th and 11th postoperative days. HBsAg positivity was observed in 13 cases before liver transplantation. Eleven patients survived and later received anti-HBV treatment recommended by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases. Their HBsAg became negative. CONCLUSION: Liver transplantation is an effective therapy for ALF and can improve survival rate significantly.
1889988	[Orthotopic liver transplantation at the Island Hospital. Initial experiences 1985-1990].	Between 1985 and 1990 22 orthotopic liver transplantations (OLT) were realized in 19 patients. Active infection and diffuse splanchnic venous thrombosis were the only contra-indications to the intervention. Sixteen patients were transplanted electively; three had to be retransplanted urgently. Three patients had an urgent primary transplant. The incidence of surgical complications related to liver implantation was fair. One patient (5%) developed a late portal vein thrombosis; another patient (5%) had to be retransplanted because of hepatic artery thrombosis. All patients presented one or more major postoperative complications. All, but one, patients had a rejection of the allograft; five of them needed treatment with mono- or polyclonal antilymphocytic sera to reverse the rejection. One patient was retransplanted because of a hyperacute rejection. The six-month survival in this series is 68.5% (13 of 18 patients); one patient died 7 months post-OLT due to a neurological complication of her Wilson disease. Quality of life (from 6 to 64 months post-OLT) is excellent in the 12 long-term survivors. This small experience of the Bernese transplantation program shows that liver transplantation is a safe surgical procedure allowing excellent quality of life in a majority of patients.

19207220	New-onset diabetes mellitus presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis after pediatric liver transplantation.	The development of NODM is a common metabolic complication after liver transplantation. Presentation of post-liver transplant diabetes mellitus with DKA is rare especially among pediatric patients. We reported three pediatric patients who presented with DKA after liver transplantation. The underlying diseases leading to transplantation were cryptogenic liver cirrhosis, Wilson disease, and congenital hepatic fibrosis. None of the three patients had a history of diabetes prior to transplantation and all of them were cases of NODM after transplantation. All three patients presented with severe hyperglycemia, significant ketosis, and metabolic acidosis of variable severity. All of them received tacrolimus as one of the immunosuppressant agents. The patients received a liver transplant from a DD. The patients were treated with intravenous insulin injection (0.1 U/kg/h) and recovered from DKA, but one case expired in the intensive care unit because of bacterial sepsis after recovery from DKA. Our experience suggests that PTDM may result in ketoacidosis, and we emphasize the importance of paying more attention to glucose metabolism and risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with immunosuppressive therapy, especially tacrolimus.

1929042	Wilson disease: clinical presentation, treatment, and survival.	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the diagnostic features, clinical course, and overall long-term survival of patients with Wilson disease. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study with a mean follow-up period of 14.2 years. SETTING: A university medical center and a community hospital. PATIENTS: Fifty-one consecutive patients with Wilson disease were evaluated between 1957 and 1989. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were treated with D-penicillamine (600 to 1800 mg/d). Two patients with end-stage liver disease had liver transplantation. MAIN RESULTS: Initial symptoms occurred at a mean age of 15.5 years. At diagnosis, the most common neurologic signs were dysarthria, tremor, writing difficulties, and ataxia followed by hypersalivation and headache. Somatic symptoms included abdominal pain, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, cirrhosis of the liver, and thrombocytopenia. The mean serum concentrations of ceruloplasmin and copper were 44 mg/L and 4.7 mumol/L, respectively. The mean basal urinary copper excretion was 5.5 mumol/d, and the mean hepatic copper concentration was 19.6 mumol/g dry weight. Free serum copper concentration (mean, 2.7 mumol/L) was a reliable indicator of disease and was useful in assessing the effectiveness of therapy (values less than 1.6 mumol/L). Treatment with D-penicillamine improved most of the hematologic and neurologic abnormalities but had little effect on hepatomegaly and splenomegaly and did not reverse cirrhosis. Two patients died of fulminant hepatic failure during the observation period, whereas two others with end-stage liver disease had successful liver transplantation and remain asymptomatic. Long-term survival of patients with Wilson disease was similar to that of age- and sex-matched controls. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that long-term treatment of patients with Wilson disease with D-penicillamine can relieve symptoms and improve prognosis.
31568969	Melatonin: A hypothesis regarding its use to treat Wilson disease.	Wilson disease is associated with excessive copper accumulation in cells, primarily in the liver and brain. The subcellular lesions caused by an excess of this essential metal accounts for many of the signs of Wilson disease. The drugs used to treat this disease are not always effective, and depending on dose, they may have collateral toxicity. Melatonin is an endogenously-produced molecule that functions as a copper chelator, a potent antioxidant, and as a suppressor of endoplasmic reticulum stress and the unfolded protein response in both the liver and the brain, while also reducing fibrosis/cirrhosis in the liver. Melatonin is inexpensive, non-toxic and can be administered via any route. Melatonin should be tested for its potential utility in experimental models of Wilson disease with extension to the human if melatonin proves to be effective in the animal studies.

OBJECTIVES: In Wilson disease (WD), 24-hour urinary copper excretion (UCE) is recommended to be used for diagnosis. It may be a useful tool to assess the efficacy of treatment during follow-up; however, there are limited data regarding the cutoff value of 24-hour UCE during follow-up in children. Therefore, we aim to evaluate the clinical use of 24-hour UCE during follow-up in children with WD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Medical records of children diagnosed with WD at Kings' College Hospital from 2005 to 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. The UCE, serum copper, and ceruloplasmin levels, tested during follow-up, were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: Over the median duration of 7 years (range 1.4-14.4), 28 patients (age ranged 3.8-17.3 years) had UCE tests during follow-up. Of those, 21 patients had at least one 24-hour UCE test and 7 children had only spot UCE tests. In comparison with the level of 24-hour UCE collected at the first visit after penicillamine challenge test, the median excretion rate was significantly reduced over the follow-up period (P < 0.001), from 26.2 to 8.9 mumol/day following 1-2 years of therapy (P = 0.15), then reduced significantly to 2.2 mumol/day after 3-4 years (P = 0.009), and 5.6 mumol/day at >5 years of follow-up (P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that within 1 year of treatment, the level of nonceruloplasmin-bound copper concentration (NCC) drops to <0.8 mumol/L. In the absence of progressive liver disease or signs of copper deficiency, 24-hour UCE decreases to <=8 mumol/day and <6 mumol/day after 1 and 5 years of treatment, respectively.

30665472	Clinical Utility of Longitudinal Measurement of Motor Threshold in Wilson's Disease.	This study describes the longitudinal changes of resting motor threshold (RMT) and central motor conduction time (CMCT) in 18 patients with Wilson's disease (WD). The RMT, CMCT, and Global Assessment Scale for Wilson Disease (GAS-WD) were measured at baseline and at follow-up after 12.94 +- 7.23 months. There was a significant decrease in the RMT (72.11 +- 18.62 vs. 63.7 +- 15.52%; p-value = 0.002) and GAS-WD scores (14.38 +- 5.35 vs. 9.77 +- 6.47 ms; p-value = 0.04). CMCT did not improve despite chelation therapy. Hence, RMT may serve as a marker of chelation efficacy in WD.
30368998	Recovery of severe acute liver failure without transplantation in patients with Wilson disease.	Wilson disease (WD) is a disorder of copper metabolism that leads to liver cirrhosis. WD patients with a NWIS > 11 should receive LT; however, we encountered 2 WD patients with an NWIS > 11 who recovered from ALF without LT. The present report aimed to analyze cases of WD patients with a high NWIS who recovered from severe ALF and to discuss the clinical manifestations of the patients and the effects of treatments, including zinc (Zn) therapy, chelator therapy, PE, CHDF, and LT. We retrospectively evaluated the medical records of five patients (male, 2; female, 3) diagnosed with WD along with severe ALF. In cases 1, 2, and 3, complete recovery from ALF was noted without LT. In case 4, initial recovery from ALF was noted without LT; however, ALF worsened owing to bleeding from the esophageal varix. Thus, the patient eventually needed LT. In case 5, recovery from ALF was noted with LT. All cases, except case 2, showed ALF with maximum PELD/MELD scores >=26 and NWISs >= 11, and had indications for LT. In cases of severe ALF with grade I or II encephalopathy, we recommend evaluations of the effects of Zn and chelator treatments while preparing for LT, as the condition may not improve without LT, and pediatricians or physicians can ask transplant surgeons to perform LT urgently if required.
20199365	Neuromuscular complication after liver transplant in children: a single-center experience.	OBJECTIVES: Neurologic complications are a significant cause of morbidity in children after liver transplant. In this study, we sought to evaluate the neurologic complications in children after liver transplant. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All children aged younger than 18 years old who had undergone liver transplant between June 2004 and June 2007 were included in this prospective study. There were 30 boys (62.5%) and 18 girls (37.5%) (mean age, 9.6 -/+ 4.3 years; mean duration of follow-up, 21.6 -/+ 9.4 months). The most common indications for liver transplant were biliary atresia (n=12, 25%), Wilson disease (n=7, 14.6%), tyrosinemia (n=7, 14.6%), progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (n=6, 12.5%), and autoimmune cirrhosis (n=5, 10.4%). RESULTS: Immunosuppressive medication consisted tacrolimus (n=44, 91.7%) or cyclosporine (n=4, 8.3%) combined with mycophenolate mofetil (n=33, 68.7%) and prednisolone (n=18, 37.5%). The most-common neurologic complications were tremor (n=8, 16.7%), convulsions (n=6, 12.5%), insomnia (n=6, 12.5%), headache (n=5, 10.4%), muscle cramps (n=5, 10.4%), paresthesia (n=3, 6.2%), and weakness (n=3, 6.2%). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the most-common neurologic complication after liver transplant in children in contrast to other studies is tremor, same as adult patients. This may be due to higher rate of use of tacrolimus in our patients.
23441660	Tacrolimus-induced thrombotic microangiopathy in orthotopic liver transplant patients: case series of four patients.	Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is a potentially fatal complication in solid organ and bone marrow transplant patients, with reported incidence of 0.5-3% and mortality of about 75%. To emphasise the importance of early diagnosis and prompt commencement of therapy results in improved clinical outcomes. A retrospective study of all patients who underwent orthotopic liver transplantation (OLTX) at the Western Australian Liver Transplantation Service from May 1994 to December 2010 was conducted to identify patients who developed tacrolimus-induced TMA. We identified four patients with tacrolimus-induced TMA post-OLTX, derived from a cohort of 104 patients treated with tacrolimus in our institution. The mean age at diagnosis was 40 years, and the mean time of onset was 63 +- 7.5 weeks after OLTX. The indications for OLTX in the four patients were fulminant hepatic failure in three (Wilson disease, paracetamol overdose and post-partum thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura) and hepatitis C virus-related cirrhosis. All patients had tacrolimus post-OLTX. At diagnosis, tacrolimus was discontinued in all patients, and three of the four patients underwent plasma exchange and all patients improved clinically. Mean duration of follow up was 15 +- 7.5 months. There was no mortality 6 months post-TMA. Early diagnosis with immediate discontinuation or conversion of calcineurin inhibitors and plasma exchange should be offered to OLTX patients with TMA as it results in good outcomes.
10715914	[Pregnancy and delivery after liver transplantation: case report].	We report a case of successful pregnancy in a 22-year-old primigravida who became pregnant 19 months after orthotopic liver transplantation for end-stage liver dysfunction caused by Wilson disease. The mother continued immunosuppressive therapy (tacrolimus) during the pregnancy. No complications were observed. Labour started spontaneously at 40th week's gestation. As a result the healthy male infant weighing 3900 g was born. Patient and the baby were discharged from hospital, both in good condition, on the fifth day after delivery.
16996405	Psychological presentations without hepatic involvement in Wilson disease.	Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive inborn error of copper metabolism that leads to neurologic symptoms and variable degrees of hepatic damage. The most common characteristic signs clinically are liver disease, psychiatric disease, neurologic disease, or a combination of these. Early recognition by means of clinical signs and an early initiation of therapy using chelators or zinc-salts are essential for a good outcome and prognosis. This report describes a male suffering from Wilson disease who exhibited an unusual presentation that included psychological manifestations without hepatic involvement. He was initially treated for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and a seizure disorder until brain imaging established the diagnosis of Wilson disease.
11477856	[Curative effect of TCM-WM therapy on Wilson disease with different clinical phenotypes and polymorphisms of ATP7B gene].	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the curative effect of TCM-WM therapy on Wilson disease (WD) with different clinical phenotypes and polymorphisms of ATP7B gene. METHODS: One hundred and twenty-two WD patients with different clinical phenotypes were treated with unithiol 20 mg/kg per day and Gandou tablet ([symbol: see text]) for 1 month. Exon 18 of ATP7B gene extracted from patients and 20 healthy volunteers were amplified with PCR technique, mutations and polymorphisms were screened by SSCP analysis. RESULTS: Four kinds of abnormal migration bands in PCR-SSCP were seen in 37 patients, mutation frequencies of three different clinical phenotypes and curative effect between mutation and non-mutation patients did not show any significant difference, P > 0.05. But total effective rate of patients with Wilson type or pseudosclerosis type was significantly higher than that of patients with hepatic type, P < 0.05. CONCLUSIONS: The exon 18 of ATP7B gene of Chinese WD patients may be one of the regions with higher mutation frequency, most of them are compound heterozygotes and patients with different clinical phenotypes have different response to TCM-WM therapy. It indicate that specific mutations at least in part play a role in influencing clinical phenotypes and curative effect.
12584791	[Study on relationship between Arg778Leu/Gln gene mutation spot in ATP7B and TCM syndrome type in Chinese patients with Wilson disease].	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between Arg778Leu/Gln gene mutation spot in ATP7B and TCM Syndrome type in Chinese patients with Wilson disease (WD). METHODS: Exon 8 of ATP7B of 90 WD patients and 30 healthy controls were amplified by PCR and analysed by restriction enzyme Msp I, the TCM Syndrome type of the patients was differentiated at the same time. RESULTS: In the 90 WD patients, 34 with Arg778Leu/Gln of exon 8 were detected, among them 20 cases belonged to the TCM Syndrome type of endogenous Liver-Wind agitation. CONCLUSION: Onset age of WD patients with Arg778Leu/Gln mutation is later than that without this mutation. Arg778Leu/Gln mutation might be related to the TCM Syndrome type of endogenous Liver-Wind agitation.
29579829	Mortality Analysis of Acute Liver Failure in Uruguay.	BACKGROUND: Acute liver failure (ALF) is a syndrome with high mortality. OBJECTIVE: Describe characteristics and outcomes of patients with ALF in Uruguay, and identify factors associated with mortality. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 33 patients with ALF was performed between 2009 and 2017. RESULTS: The patients' median age was 43 years, and 64% were women. Average Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score at admission was 33. The median referral time to the liver transplant (LT) center was 7 days. The most common etiologies were viral hepatitis (27%), indeterminate (21%), autoimmune (18%), and Wilson disease (15%). Overall mortality was 52% (71% of transplanted and 46% of nontransplanted patients). Dead patients had higher referral time (10 vs 4 days, P = .008), higher MELD scores at admission (37 vs 28) and highest achieved MELD scores (42 vs 29; P < .001), and higher encephalopathy grade III to IV (94% vs 25%, P < .001) than survivors. Patients without LT criteria (n = 4) had lower MELD score at admission (25 vs 34, P = .001) and highest achieved MELD score (27 vs 37, P = .008) compared with the others. Patients with LT criteria but contraindications (n = 7) had higher MELD scores at admission (38 vs 31, P = .02), highest achieved MELD scores (41 vs 34, P = .03), and longer referral time (10 days) than those without contraindications (3.5 days) or those without LT criteria (7.5 days, P = .02). Twenty-two patients were listed; LT was performed in 7, with a median time on waiting list of 6 days. CONCLUSIONS: ALF in Uruguay has high mortality associated with delayed referral to the LT center, MELD score, and encephalopathy. The long waiting times to transplantation might influence mortality.
8723326	Wilson disease: genetic basis of copper toxicity and natural history.	The discovery that the gene for Wilson disease encodes a copper-transporting ATPase has greatly improved our understanding of the pathophysiology of this disorder and of copper metabolism in humans. The abundance of disease-specific mutations and their location at multiple sites across the genome have limited molecular genetic diagnosis to kindred of known patients, and confirm the necessity for de novo screening by well-proven clinical and biochemical means. It is uncertain whether the variety of specific mutations will account for the wide range of presenting clinical signs and symptoms of Wilson disease, and environmental and extragenic factors are likely to be important contributing factors. Chelation therapy with penicillamine and trientine remain effective treatment for most symptomatic hepatic and neurologic Wilson disease. Zinc salts may be used for some asymptomatic patients, and OLT for fulminant hepatitis and patients for whom pharmacotherapy is ineffective. The chelating agent tetrathiomolybdate is under investigation for the treatment of neurologic Wilson disease. Gene therapy is the new horizon for treatment of Wilson disease. However, the ability to treat this disorder effectively by this means awaits further characterization of the gene product and more efficient methods for gene delivery to all hepatocytes in the liver.
16504704	The use Prometheus FPSA system in the treatment of acute liver failure: preliminary results.	UNLABELLED: The preliminary outcomes of patients with acute liver failure treated with the Prometheus Fractionated Plasma Separation and Absorption (FPSA) system are presented herein. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The procedures were performed in 13 patients (4, intoxication by Amanita phalloides; 4, unknown reason; 3, acetaminophen intoxication; 1, Wilson disease, and 1, liver insufficiency after hemihepatectomy owing to metastases of colon adenocarcinoma). The patients were qualified for the procedure according to the King's College Hospital criteria. The patients' general status was assessed on basic of GCS, UNOS, and the 4-grade encephalopathy classifications. The procedures were performed with the Prometheus 4008H Fresenius Medical Care unit. RESULTS: The 29 procedures were of mean duration 6.5 hours. There were statistically significant reductions in total bilirubin, ammonia, and aminotransferase levels. In addition, the procedures corrected water, mineral, and carbohydrate disorders. One patient did not require liver transplantation. Seven patients received liver transplants: three patients with positive outcomes; two died due to septicemia within 30 days perioperatively, one died at 6 months after OLT owing to respiratory failure; and one, owing to hemorrhagic diathesis. Four patients did not receive a liver transplant because of lack of a organ, no consent for the surgery, or neoplastic disease with metastases. CONCLUSIONS: The Prometheus FPSA-System was an effective detoxication method for patients with acute liver failure. The system was useful as a symptomatic treatment before liver transplantation allowing a longer wait for a graft.
37936530	Outcome of pediatric living donor liver transplant: Experience from Pakistan; a resource limited setting.	INTRODUCTION: Liver transplantation (LT) has emerged as a lifesaving modality for many liver diseases in children. Pediatric LT is an established treatment in the Western world but is relatively a new procedure in resource-limited countries like Pakistan. The study aims to highlight the outcomes and survival of pediatric recipients from the first pediatric liver transplant center in Pakistan. METHOD: A retrospective analysis of pediatric LT was done from 2012 to 2019. The study was conducted in the Hepatobiliary and liver transplant department of Shifa International Hospital (SIH), Islamabad. A detailed analysis for indications for pediatric LT, survival, and complications was done. RESULTS: Forty-five patients under 18 years of age underwent Living donor liver transplant (LDLT) in SIH. Median age was 9 years and M:F of 2:1. Cryptogenic liver disease followed by Wilson disease were the two most common indications of LT. The majority of patients had chronic liver disease 34 (75%) while 11 (24%) had acute liver failure. The right lobe graft was the most common type of graft 19 (42.2%). Thirty days, 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival was 77.8%, 75.6%, 73.3%, and 60.6% respectively. Mortality was highest in patients with biliary atresia 4 (33%). Causes of death included pulmonary embolism, sepsis, surgical complications, and acute kidney injury. Mean survival was 88.850 months (+-7.899) (CI 73.369-104.331). CONCLUSION: Pediatric LDLT has offered disease-free survival for patients. Survival can improve further with nutritional rehabilitation and anticipation and management of post-operative complications.
29325220	Profile, risk factors and outcome of acute kidney injury in paediatric acute-on-chronic liver failure.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: There are no studies on acute kidney injury in paediatric acute-on-chronic liver failure. This study was planned with aim to describe the clinical presentation and outcome of acute kidney injury among paediatric acute-on-chronic liver failure patients. METHODS: Data of all children 1-18 years of age presenting with acute chronic liver failure (Asia pacific association for the study of the liver definition) was reviewed. Acute kidney injury was defined as per Kidney Diseases-Improving Global Outcomes guidelines. Poor outcome was defined as death or need for liver transplant within 3 months of development of acute kidney injury. RESULTS: A total of 84 children with acute-on-chronic liver failure were presented to us in the study period. Acute kidney injury developed in 22.6% of patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure. The median duration from acute-on-chronic liver failure to development of acute kidney injury was 4 weeks (Range: 2-10 weeks). The causes of acute kidney injury were hepatorenal syndrome (31.6%), sepsis (31.6%), nephrotoxic drugs (21%), dehydration (10.5%) and bile pigment related acute tubular necrosis in one patient. On univariate analysis, higher baseline bilirubin, higher international normalized ratio, higher paediatric end stage liver disease, presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome and presence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis had significant association with presence of acute kidney injury. On logistic regression analysis, presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (adjusted OR: 8.659, 95% CI: 2.18-34.37, P = .002) and higher baseline bilirubin (adjusted OR: 1.07, 95% CI: 1.008-1.135, P = .025) were independently associated with presence of acute kidney injury. Of the patients with acute kidney injury, 5(26.3%) survived with native liver, 10(52.6%) died and 4 (21.1%) underwent liver transplantation. CONCLUSION: Acute kidney injury developed in 22.6% of children with acute-on-chronic liver failure. Bilirubin more than 17.7 mg/dL and presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome were high risk factors for acute kidney injury. Development of acute kidney injury in a child with acute-on-chronic liver failure suggests poor outcome and need for early intervention.
10378366	[Therapy of Wilson disease].	Wilson disease is a copper storage disease with autosomal-recessive trait that is predominantly a disorder of the adolescent and young adult. Clinical manifestations are dominated by hepatic and/or neurological symptoms. Diagnostic procedures include determination of total serum copper, free serum copper and serum ceruloplamin concentrations as well as urinary copper excretion. Confirmation of diagnosis may be achieved by liver biopsy and histological determination of copper content. The aim of treatment is reduction of tissue copper concentration and detoxification of copper. Drugs applied are the chelating agents. D-penicillamine and trientine, or zinc. The chelating agents induce renal and biliary copper excretion and increased synthesis of metallothionein, which attaches and detoxifies intracellular copper, leading to impaired absorption and binding of excess intracellular copper. Treatment with zinc results in induction of hepatic and intestinal metallothionein synthesis. Regular examinations of the parameters of copper metabolism are necessary in order to control the therapeutic effect. Free copper serum concentrations and urinary copper excretion should reach values below 10 micrograms/dl and 80 micrograms/day, respectively. A significant improvement of clinical symptoms and normalization of parameters of copper metabolism can be expected earliest six months after onset of therapy. Anti-copper treatment may be accompanied by copper-reduced diet. Lifelong therapy is required and provides life-expectancy near to normal. Interruption of treatment leads to reaccumulation of copper, often resulting in fulminant hepatic failure. This can also be observed as initial presentation in 5% of cases (predominant age 12 to 25 years). End stage liver disease and fulminant hepatic failure are indications for liver transplantation by which the genetic defect is phenotypically cured. Here decoppering treatment is no longer required. Whether severe neurological disorders may also be improved is not clear until today.
25432729	Wilson disease and other neurodegenerations with metal accumulations.	Trace elements, such as iron, copper, manganese, and calcium, which are essential constituents necessary for cellular homeostasis, become toxic when present in excess quantities. In this article, we describe disorders arising from endogenous dysregulation of metal homeostasis leading to their tissue accumulation. Although subgroups of these diseases lead to regional brain metal accumulation, mostly in globus pallidus, which is susceptible to accumulate divalent metal ions, other subgroups cause systemic metal accumulation affecting the whole brain, liver, and other parenchymal organs. The latter group comprises Wilson disease, manganese transporter deficiency, and aceruloplasminemia and responds favorably to chelation treatment.

28284465	Neurological disorders in liver transplant candidates: Pathophysiology and clinical assessment.	"Compromised liver function, as a consequence of acute liver insufficiency or severe chronic liver disease may be associated with various neurological syndromes, which involve both central and peripheral nervous system. Acute and severe hyperammoniemia inducing cellular metabolic alterations, prolonged state of ""neuroinflammation"", activation of brain microglia, accumulation of manganese and ammonia, and systemic inflammation are the main causative factors of brain damage in liver failure. The most widely recognized neurological complications of serious hepatocellular failure include hepatic encephalopathy, diffuse cerebral edema, Wilson disease, hepatic myelopathy, acquired hepatocerebral degeneration, cirrhosis-related Parkinsonism and osmotic demyelination syndrome. Neurological disorders affecting liver transplant candidates while in the waiting list may not only significantly influence preoperative morbidity and even mortality, but also represent important predictive factors for post-transplant neurological manifestations. Careful pre-transplant neurological evaluation is essential to define severity and distribution of the neurological impairment, to identify the abnormalities still responsive to current treatment, and to potentially predict the inherent post-operative prognosis. The preferred specific indices of neurological pre-transplant assessment may vary among centers, however, even with the aid of the current biochemical, neurophysiological, neuropsychological and neuroimaging diagnostic tools, the correct diagnosis and differential diagnosis of various syndromes may be difficult. In this article the relevant pathophysiological and clinical aspects of the most frequent brain and peripheral nervous system diseases affecting liver transplant candidates with acute or advanced chronic liver failure are briefly reported. The practical diagnostic findings useful for the preoperative assessment and treatment, as well as the expected neurological evolution after liver transplantation are also evaluated."
904351	Early pleural decortication for thoracic empyema in immunosuppressed patients.	Patients with empyema and impaired immune response often remain in a toxic condition after tube thoracostomy because the infection is not localized and walled off satisfactorily. Consequently, the reported mortality rate is extremely high. Despite the expectation of a high mortality rate from thoracotomy and debridement in this category of critically ill patients, we were forced to perform pleural decortication in eight patients after lesser procedures had failed. They were immunodeficient because of (1) high-dose steroids (HDS) for sagittal sinus thrombosis, (2) HDS for systemic lupus erythematosus, (3) HDS for chronic myelogenous leukemia and myelofibrosis, (4) HDS for multiple myeloma, (5) hemolytic anemia with pulmonary infiltrates, (6) chemotherapy for Hodgkin's disease, (7) diabetes mellitus with Kimmelstiel-Wilson disease, and (8) diabetes mellitus with chronic glomerulonephritis. Six of the eight patients survived and were discharged with completely healed incisions 3 to 6 weeks after operation. This compares well with the survival rates reported by others. Although risky, the over-all survival rate may be better with thoracotomy and decortication than with prolonged tube drainage and open drainage in immunodeficient patients with empyema, and the period of morbidity is shortened considerably.
24266916	Metal storage disorders: Wilson disease and hemochromatosis.	Hereditary hemochromatosis and Wilson disease are autosomal recessive storage disorders of iron and copper overload, respectively. These metals are involved in multiple redox reactions, and their abnormal accumulation can cause significant injury in the liver and other organs. Over the last few decades clinicians have developed a much better understanding of these metals and their mechanism of action. Moreover, sophisticated molecular genetic testing techniques that make diagnostic testing less invasive are now available. This article updates and discusses the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of these metal storage disorders. 
1870819	Recurrent abortion and the diagnosis of Wilson disease.	We describe the first patient with Wilson disease and recurrent abortion who was effectively treated with oral zinc for both conditions. Between the ages of 21-26, this patient experienced seven successive unexplained abortions. At age 27, neurologic signs and liver function disturbances appeared. Wilson disease was diagnosed when Kayser-Fleischer rings were detected in the cornea. Decoppering therapy was instituted with zinc sulfate per os. By the age of 31, hepatic and neurologic signs had vanished. The patient conceived, and after an uncomplicated eighth pregnancy she delivered her first healthy child. Two years later, a ninth pregnancy was equally successful. The chance that Wilson disease may be the cause of recurrent abortion is small. However, because the disease is fatal if left untreated and because it is an underdiagnosed disease, we recommend screening for Wilson disease in cases of unexplained recurrent abortion when family history demonstrates consanguinity or neurologic, psychiatric, and/or liver disorders. A strategy to this end is proposed.
25128653	Does lesioning surgery have a role in the management of multietiological tremor in the era of Deep Brain Stimulation?	INTRODUCTION: Surgical management of tremor has evolved over the years with Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) gradually supplanting lesioning as the mainstay in treatment. In this article, the largest of its kind from our country, we present our experience in the use of lesioning in the management of patients with multietiological tremors. These include not only common indications like Parkinson disease and essential tremor but also rare causes such as Pantothenate kinase associated neurodegeneration (PKAN), multiple sclerosis (MS) and Wilson disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with medically refractory tremor who underwent surgery were included in the analysis. A comprehensive clinical and radiological evaluation was performed which was repeated 3 months postoperatively and at successive visits. Video documentation of was obtained at all visits. RESULTS: A total of 21 patients (18 men, 3 women) with an average age 37.7 years (range 21-65 years) underwent stereotactic thalamotomy/subthalamotomy at our institute between 2008 and 2013, for the treatment of medically refractory tremor of varying etiologies. The mean preoperative duration of symptoms was 11 years (range 10 months to 34 years). The median time to onset of improvement was 2 months (range 1 week to 8 months). Analyzing the improvement on the modified FTM scale, in part 1 the scores improved from 21.7 to 1.5, the part II subset improved from an average of 9.2 to 3.2 while the part III subset improved from an average of 14.1 to 4.1 postoperatively. This implied an excellent response in tremor while the other 2 components had a very good response. DISCUSSION: In this study we have for the first time objectively analyzed the tremor improvement with a modified FTM scale and have produced excellent results. We have also shown that tremor of various etiologies respond extremely well to lesioning surgery. While DBS continues to remain the treatment of choice in various types of bilateral tremor, lesioning is very successful in a carefully selected cohort of patients. We are of the opinion that in predominantly unilateral tremor or when the patient cannot afford DBS especially in a country like ours, lesioning surgery is an important tool in the armamentarium of the functional neurosurgeon.
33159804	Wilson disease: revision of diagnostic criteria in a clinical series with great genetic homogeneity.	BACKGROUND: Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene. An early diagnosis is crucial to prevent evolution of the disease, as implantation of early therapeutic measures fully prevents its symptoms. As population genetics data predict a higher than initially expected prevalence, it was important to define the basic diagnostic tools to approach population screening. METHODS: A highly genetically homogeneous cohort of 70 patients, belonging to 50 unrelated families, has been selected as a framework to analyze all their clinical, biochemical and genetic characteristics, to define the disease in our population, with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 12,369, and determine the most useful features that reach diagnostic value. RESULTS: Serum ceruloplasmin below 11.5 mg/dL and cupremia below 60 mug/mL, were the best analytical predictors of the disease in asymptomatic individuals, while cupruria or hepatic copper determination were less powerful. Genetic analysis reached a conclusive diagnosis in all 65 patients available for complete testing. Of them, 48 were carriers of at least one p.Leu708Pro mutant allele, with 24 homozygotes. Nine patients carried a promoter deletion mutation, revealing that extended sequencing beyond the ATP7B gene-coding region is essential. All mutations caused hepatic damage since early ages, increasing its severity as diagnosis was delayed, and neurological symptoms appear. CONCLUSION: Serum ceruloplasmin determination followed by genetic screening would reduce costs and favor the prioritization of non-invasive procedures to reach a definitive diagnosis, even for asymptomatic cases.
21654009	Reversal of severe Wilson arthropathy by liver transplantation.	Wilson disease is associated with multisystem involvement. We describe a patient of Wilson disease with severe arthropathy, which completely reversed following liver transplantation. This is the first case report in literature describing the complete reversal of Wilson disease related arthropathy by liver transplantation.
22730635	Good response with zinc acetate monotherapy in an adolescent affected by severe Wilson disease.	We describe a 17-year-old girl with haemolytic anaemia as presentation of Wilson disease. The diagnosis was based on the findings of < 20 mg/dl ceruloplasmin serum level, Kayser-Fleischer ring and Coombs-negative haemolytic anaemia. Genetic testing revealed the presence of the H1069Q heterozygous mutation. The patient was treated with Zinc acetate monotherapy, with good response, maintened after 22 months. This case emphasizes the importance of recognizing atypical clinical presentation of Wilson disease, which must always be considered in patients with Coombs-negative haemolytic anaemia. The good clinical response to treatment with zinc acetate monotherapy in our case might lend to consider the use of zinc monotherapy as initial therapy also in symptomatic patients with Wilson disease under close clinical observation. Clinical trials are needed to provide evidence for use of zinc monotherapy as first-line therapy in symptomatic patients with Wilson disease.
11883310	[Menstrual cycle in women with Wilson disease before and after liver transplantation].	Four cases of young women with Wilson's disease who underwent liver transplantation are presented. The menstrual disturbances associated with Wilson's disease are presented and discussed.
19066958	Triethylene tetramine dihydrochloride (trientine) in children with Wilson disease: experience at King's College Hospital and review of the literature.	Our aim was to review our experience of trientine as chelation therapy in children with Wilson disease (WD) and compare to that reported in the literature. We made a retrospective review of the medical notes of 16 of 96 (17%) children diagnosed with WD between 1981 and 2006. Children were 6.6 to 15 years old. Only three received trientine as initial therapy [parental choice (two), allergic reactions to penicillamine (one) during the penicillamine challenge], 13 of 16 were converted from penicillamine to trientine because of reactions to penicillamine: haematuria in four, bone marrow suppression in three, neutropenia in three. Trientine was discontinued in three due to allergic rash, low copper excretion and one with compliance problems requiring transplantation. Seventy-five per cent of children presented with chronic liver disease. Kayser-Fleischer rings were noticed in eight of 16, Wilson Ferenci score range was between 4 and 10 (nl < 4). Laboratory indices remained relatively stable. In line with previous reports, trientine was used mainly as secondary treatment when there were severe side effects with penicillamine. Whilst the current evidence is low quality, it appears that trientine is as efficacious as penicillamine and small population studies show a lower side effect profile.
15464656	Wilson disease: pathophysiology, diagnosis, treatment, and screening.	Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive condition of copper metabolism that was once considered fatal. The identification of the gene for Wilson disease has led to a better understanding of the molecular defect underlying this disorder and has impacted on disease diagnosis for some individuals. Medical therapy with chelating agents or zinc salts remains the mainstay of therapy for most patients, and liver transplant is lifesaving for those with advanced disease refractory to medical therapy or with fulminant hepatic failure. Future cell-based and genetic therapies may provide a cure for this disorder.
15561215	Successful case of adult ABO-incompatible liver transplantation: beneficial effects of intrahepatic artery infusion therapy: a case report.	BACKGROUND: In Japan ABO-incompatible liver transplantation has been done on >100 occasions up to 2003. However, <30% are cases involving adults. The difficultly of ABO-incompatible liver transplantation is associated with the high frequency of humoral rejection and local disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), leading to many postoperative complications. We report a successful case of adult ABO-incompatible liver transplantation with the use of an intrahepatic artery infusion. METHODS: A 36-year-old man with Wilson disease, underwent living donor liver transplantation from an ABO-incompatible donor. The immunosuppressive therapy included multiple perioperative plasmaphereses, splenectomy, and treatment with tacrolimus, methylprednisolone, and cyclophosphamide. The dose and blood level of tacrolimus were the same as in ABO-compatible cases. In addition to these therapies, we administered an intrahepatic arterial infusion with prostaglandin (PG) E1 alone. RESULTS: After perioperative plasmapheresis and cyclophosphamide, antidonor blood group antibody titers remained undiluted and without vascular complications throughout the postoperative course, but there was a tendency for bleeding that continued for 10 days after transplantation. On postoperative day 10, a reexploration was performed for intraabdominal bleeding. During another operation on postoperative day 59 a biloma was found and drained. The patient has now survived for 120 days after transplantation with normal liver function. CONCLUSIONS: Beneficial effect of intrahepatic artery infusion with PGE1 seems to be useful in adult ABO-incompatible liver transplantation.
31884064	Assessment of the Hallmarks of Wilson Disease in CT Scan Imaging.	INTRODUCTION: Owing to nonspecific clinical symptoms, Wilson disease (WD) diagnosis is often missed or delayed; hence, many patients reach end-stage liver disease. When cirrhosis takes place, it is difficult to distinguish between WD and other causes of cirrhosis by imaging alone. This study outlines abdominal computed tomography (CT) imaging findings that occur more frequently in patients with WD cirrhosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty-seven patients with WD who had referred for liver transplantation took part in this study and underwent dynamic liver CT examination before transplantation. Qualitative and quantitative parameters including liver density, contour irregularity, dysmorphia, hypertrophy of caudate lobe, presence of focal parenchymal lesion, thickness of perihepatic fat layer, periportal thickness, lymphadenopathy, and other associated findings were recorded and evaluated. RESULTS: Among these patients, 85.9% had contour irregularity, 28% had hepatic dysmorphia, and periportal thickening and cholelithiasis were found in 25.5% and 12.3% of patients, respectively. Splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and portosystemic shunting were observed in all patients. Also, hyperdense nodules (>20 mm) and honeycomb pattern were detected in 65.2% and 15.2% of patients, respectively, in the arterial phase. In the portal phase, these findings were detected only in 13% and 4.3% of patients. Hypertrophy of caudate lobe was seen only in 12.2% of patients. CONCLUSION: WD-associated cirrhosis has many CT imaging findings, although most of them are nonspecific. Some findings, such as hyperdense nodules and honeycomb pattern in non-contrast-enhanced CT scan and arterial phase of triphasic CT scan with lack of hypertrophy of caudate lobes, are hallmarks of WD.
30836904	Evaluation of Underlying Liver Disease and Its Severity in Children Referred for Liver Transplant: a Single-Center Report From Nemazee Hospital of Shiraz.	OBJECTIVES: Liver transplant has been used as a curative approach for children with end-stage liver diseases. Here, we describe the underlying causes for pediatric liver transplant performed at the Shiraz Organ Transplantation Center, Nemazee Hospital, Shiraz, Iran. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional descriptive study, children < 18 years old who were candidates for liver transplant from 2007 to 2010 at the Shiraz Organ Transplantation Center were included. Patients were evaluated for their underlying diseases leading to liver failure. Disease severity was assessed and compared with Pediatric End-Stage Liver Disease model and the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease scores. RESULTS: Of 107 patients, 60.8% were males and 39.2% were females. The mean age was 11.6 +- 4.9 years. Thirteen patients (12.5%) were < 2 years old, 26 (24%) were 2 to 6 years old, 33 (30.8%) were 6 to 12 years old, and 35 (32.7%) were 12 to 18 years old. Underlying liver diseases comprised biliary atresia (27.1%), cryptogenic cirrhosis (21.5%), autoimmune cirrhosis (13.1%), familial intrahepatic cholestasis (11.2%), Wilson disease (9.3%), tyrosinemia (7.4%), neonatal hepatitis (4.7%), congenital hepatic fibrosis (3.7%), and Caroli disease (1.9%). Jaundice (83.2%), ascites (57%), and esophageal varices (43%) were the most common clinical findings. Mean serum direct bilirubin, total bilirubin, international normalized ratio, and serum creatinine values were 3.6 +- 0.8 mg/dL, 9.3 +- 9.1 mg/dL, 2.1 +- 1.1, and 0.6 +- 0.2 mg/dL, respectively. The mean Pediatric End-Stage Liver Disease score in children < 12 years old was 11.4 +- 9.1. The mean Model for EndStage Liver Disease score in children > 12 years old was 13.7 +- 5.9. There were no differences in scores among sex, age groups, or different etiologies. CONCLUSIONS: Scores for disease severity were not significantly different with regard to different causes of underlying diseases for liver transplant in Iranian children.
10487274	This liver is a giver: Wilson disease and living related liver transplantation.	
22922372	Transient elastography is a useful noninvasive tool for the evaluation of fibrosis in paediatric chronic liver disease.	BACKGROUND: Outcome of liver disease in children is mainly determined by severity and progression of liver fibrosis. Liver biopsy is the accepted standard for evaluating fibrosis but is limited by the need for sedation in children, sampling error, and risks including bleeding. The aim of the present study was to compare tools for noninvasive assessment of liver fibrosis in a paediatric cohort. METHODS: Children undergoing liver biopsy for chronic liver disease were recruited and underwent transient elastography (TE). Liver biopsies were scored by a hepatohistopathologist from F0 (no fibrosis) to F4 (cirrhosis). TE was compared with biopsy score. RESULTS: During the study period, 104 children (62 boys) were enrolled (median age 13.6 years). Diagnosis was autoimmune liver disease in 27; nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in 37; posttransplant in 16; hepatitis B/C in 8; Wilson disease in 5; and the remainder, miscellaneous. TE was successful in all but 7 patients and was a good discriminator of significant fibrosis (>= F2) (P < 0.001), severe fibrosis (>= F3) (P < 0.001), and cirrhosis (F4) (P = 0.003). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the prediction of >= F2, >= F3, and F4 using TE was 0.78, 0.79, and 0.96, respectively. TE performed best in children with autoimmune liver disease and in those posttransplant. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that TE is a reliable tool in distinguishing different stages of liver fibrosis in paediatric patients. Thus, TE may serve as a useful adjunct to liver biopsy for diagnostic purposes providing a reliable method of noninvasively monitoring liver disease progression in children.
17382611	Wilson disease--a practical approach to diagnosis, treatment and follow-up.	Wilson disease is an inherited, autosomal recessive, copper accumulation and toxicity disorder that affects about 30 individuals per million. This rare disease is caused by mutations in the gene encoding a copper-transporting P-type ATPase, which is important for copper excretion into bile, leading to copper accumulation in the liver. Toxic copper concentrations can also be found in the brain and kidney, and clinical phenotypes include hepatic, haemolytic, neurologic and psychiatric diseases. Diagnosis is based on the combination of clinical features and findings such as increased urinary copper excretion, reduced levels of serum ceruloplasmin, high concentrations of copper in liver tissues and Kayser-Fleischer rings. Genetic studies are also becoming available for clinical use, but the utility of direct mutation analysis is limited. Wilson disease can be treated, and early diagnosis is essential: the goal of therapy is to reduce copper accumulation either by enhancing its urinary excretion or by decreasing its intestinal absorption. Medical therapies include penicillamine, trientine, zinc and tetrathiomolibdate. Liver transplantation is a relatively successful treatment option when medical therapy fails or in case of acute liver failure, even though it is also characterized by short- and long-term complications.
36524887	Does Liver Transplant Improve Neurological Symptoms in Wilson Disease? Report of 24 Cases.	OBJECTIVES: Wilson disease is an inherited disorder that results in copper accumulation in the tissues with liver injury and failure. Orthotopic liver transplant is one of the treatments of choice for this disease. The aim of this study was to compare the neurological symptoms, before and after orthotopic livertransplant, of patients with liver cirrhosis due to Wilson disease, who represent a special group of patients with liver failure. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 2007 and 2020, there were 24 patients with Wilson disease resistant to medical treatment who underwent deceased donor orthotopic livertransplant and were followed up for 1 year, 5 years, and 10 years for evaluation with neurological scoring systems. Patients were also evaluated for postoperative complications and survival. RESULTS: Of the 24 patients evaluated, there were 13 (54.2%) female patients and 11 (45.8%) male patients, and the mean age was 34 years (range, 14-57 years). One of the patients died from early postoperative sepsis. After orthotopic livertransplant, disease scores returned to normal in 16 patients and improved in the remaining patients. Before transplant, all patients required help in their daily activities. After transplant, there were significant improvements in some symptoms, and the patients became more independent in their daily lives. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that orthotopic liver transplant provides significant improvement in neurological symptoms and quality of life in patients with Wilson disease.
2073472	[The pediatric liver transplant. The surgical aspects].	"The Liver Transplant Program was begun at ""La Paz"" Children's Hospital on January 1986 after a long period of experimental activities. This was the first experience in the Madrid Community. From January 1986 to June 1989 we made 32 orthotopic liver transplants in 25 patients, seven received a second graft and one them received a liver segment because the donor had a large liver. 114 patients were evaluated but only 84 were considered candidates for liver transplantation. The different diseases of the transplants were: biliary atresia (9), Alagille syndrome (4), deficit alpha 1-antitrypsin (3), autoimmune hepatitis (2), neonatal hepatitis (1), Byler disease (1), Wolman disease (1). absent bile ducts (1), Wilson disease (1). Surgical technique was the same that has been described by Starzl using Eurocollins and lactate Ringer. In the 100% we made multiorgan procurement, liver and kidneys, 7% with heart and two heart-lung with hypothermia. In one occasion the donor operation was done out of the country (RFA--Dusseldorf). We never used by-pass during anhepatic phase. Arterial reconstruction was done by end-to-end anastomosis and in five patients we used aortic graft. Our arterial thrombosis rate was 18%. In one patient the portal vein was atrophic and we used a femoral graft between superior mesenteric vein and donor portal vein. For biliary reconstruction we used Roux-en-Y with intraluminal stent in 18 cases and choledocho-choledochus anastomosis in seven cases. Four patients had biliary complications: two biliary fistulas secondary to arterial thrombosis, biliary stenosis and bowel perforation by the intraluminal stent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
23849977	A pilot study of autologous CD34-depleted bone marrow mononuclear cell transplantation via the hepatic artery in five patients with liver failure.	BACKGROUND AIMS: Many rodent experiments and human studies on stem cell therapy have shown promising therapeutic approaches to liver diseases. We investigated the clinical outcomes of five patients with liver failure of various causes who received autologous CD34-depleted bone marrow-derived mononuclear cell (BM-MNC) transplantation, including mesenchymal stromal cells, through the hepatic artery. METHODS: CD34-depleted BM-MNCs were obtained from five patients waiting for liver transplantation by bone marrow aspiration and using the CliniMACS CD34 Reagent System (Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany), and autologous hepatic artery infusion was performed. The causes of hepatic decompensation were hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), propylthiouracil-induced toxic hepatitis and Wilson disease. RESULTS: Serum albumin levels improved 1 week after transplantation from 2.8 g/dL, 2.4 g/dL, 2.7 g/dL and 1.9 g/dL to 3.3 g/dL, 3.1 g/dL, 2.8 g/dL and 2.6 g/dL. Transient liver elastography data showed some change from 65 kPa, 33 kPa, 34.8 kPa and undetectable to 46.4 kPa, 19.8 kPa, 29.1 kPa and 67.8 kPa at 4 weeks after transplantation in a patient with Wilson disease, a patient with HCV, and two patients with HBV. Ascites decreased in two patients. One of the patients with HBV underwent liver transplantation 4 months after the infusion, and the hepatic progenitor markers (cytokeratin [CD]-7, CD-8, CD-9, CD-18, CD-19, c-Kit and epithelial cell adhesion molecule [EpCAM]) were highly expressed in the explanted liver. CONCLUSIONS: Serum albumin levels, liver stiffness, liver volume, subjective healthiness and quality of life improved in the study patients. Although these findings were observed in a small population, the results may suggest a promising future for autologous CD34-depleted BM-MNC transplantation as a bridge to liver transplantation in patients with liver failure.
38171926	Liver-directed gene therapy for inherited metabolic diseases.	Gene therapy clinical trials are rapidly expanding for inherited metabolic liver diseases whilst two gene therapy products have now been approved for liver based monogenic disorders. Liver-directed gene therapy has recently become an option for treatment of haemophilias and is likely to become one of the favoured therapeutic strategies for inherited metabolic liver diseases in the near future. In this review, we present the different gene therapy vectors and strategies for liver-targeting, including gene editing. We highlight the current development of viral and nonviral gene therapy for a number of inherited metabolic liver diseases including urea cycle defects, organic acidaemias, Crigler-Najjar disease, Wilson disease, glycogen storage disease Type Ia, phenylketonuria and maple syrup urine disease. We describe the main limitations and open questions for further gene therapy development: immunogenicity, inflammatory response, genotoxicity, gene therapy administration in a fibrotic liver. The follow-up of a constantly growing number of gene therapy treated patients allows better understanding of its benefits and limitations and provides strategies to design safer and more efficacious treatments. Undoubtedly, liver-targeting gene therapy offers a promising avenue for innovative therapies with an unprecedented potential to address the unmet needs of patients suffering from inherited metabolic diseases.

16212637	Living donor liver transplantation for pediatric patients with inheritable metabolic disorders.	Forty-six pediatric patients who underwent living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) using parental liver grafts for inheritable metabolic disorders (IMD) were evaluated to determine the outcomes of the surgery, decisive factors for post-transplant patient survival and the impact of using donors who were heterozygous for the particular disorder. Disorders included Wilson disease (WD, n = 21), ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTCD, n = 6), tyrosinemia type I (TTI, n = 6), glycogen storage disease (GSD, n = 4), propionic acidemia (PPA, n = 3), methylmalonic acidemia (MMA, n = 2), Crigler-Najjar syndrome type I (CNSI, n = 2), bile acid synthetic defect (BASD, n = 1) and erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP, n = 1). The post-transplant cumulative patient survival rates were 86.8 and 81.2% at 1 and 5 years, respectively. Post-transplant patient survival and recovery of the growth retardation were significantly better in the liver-oriented diseases (WD, OTCD, TTI, CNSI and BASD) than in the non-liver-oriented diseases (GSD, PPA, MMA and EPP) and pre-transplant growth retardation disadvantageously affected post-transplant outcomes. Although 40 of 46 donors were considered heterozygous for each disorder, neither mortality nor morbidity related to the heterozygosis has been observed. LDLT using parental donors can be recommended as an effective treatment for pediatric patients with IMD. In the non-liver-oriented diseases, however, satisfactory outcomes were not obtained by hepatic replacement alone.
36343759	Botulinum toxin type A treatment of four cases of Wilson disease with lower limb dystonia: A prospective study.	Botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A) has been recommended in various neurological disorders as a useful tool for alleviating dystonia. In Wilson disease (WD) patients with dystonia, BoNT-A injection can be used as a treatment modality when conventional treatment is ineffective for alleviating symptoms. The purpose of this study was to thoroughly evaluate the efficacy of BoNT-A injection in treating WD complicated by lower extremity dystonia. The efficacy of these injections was assessed by clinical scales, surface electromyography (EMG), and gait analysis. A comparative analysis of all gait parameters, EMG parameters, and clinical scales revealed a significant increase in velocity, decrease in integrated EMG (iEMG), and improvement in modified Ashworth scale (MAS), Burke Fahn Marsden (BFM), and activities of daily living (ADL) scores (all P < 0.05). Overall, our findings indicated that BoNT-A injection led to marked relief of symptoms in patients with WD with lower extremity dystonia.
16606763	Treatment of Wilson disease with ammonium tetrathiomolybdate: IV. Comparison of tetrathiomolybdate and trientine in a double-blind study of treatment of the neurologic presentation of Wilson disease.	OBJECTIVE: To compare tetrathiomolybdate and trientine in treating patients with the neurologic presentation of Wilson disease for the frequency of neurologic worsening, adverse effects, and degree of neurologic recovery. DESIGN: A randomized, double-blind, controlled, 2-arm study of 48 patients with the neurologic presentation of Wilson disease. Patients either received 500 mg of trientine hydrochloride 2 times per day or 20 mg of tetrathiomolybdate 3 times per day with meals and 20 mg 3 times per day between meals for 8 weeks. All patients received 50 mg of zinc 2 times per day. Patients were hospitalized for 8 weeks, with neurologic and speech function assessed weekly; discharged taking 50 mg of zinc 3 times per day, and returned annually for follow-up. SETTING: A university hospital referral setting. PATIENTS: Primarily newly diagnosed patients with Wilson disease presenting with neurologic symptoms who had not been treated longer than 4 weeks with an anticopper drug. INTERVENTION: Treatment with either trientine plus zinc or tetrathiomolybdate plus zinc. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Neurologic function was assessed by semiquantitative neurologic and speech examinations. Drug adverse events were evaluated by blood cell counts and biochemical measures. RESULTS: Six of 23 patients in the trientine arm and 1 of 25 patients in the tetrathiomolybdate arm underwent neurologic deterioration (P<.05). Three patients receiving tetrathiomolybdate had adverse effects of anemia and/or leukopenia, and 4 had further transaminase elevations. One patient receiving trientine had an adverse effect of anemia. Four patients receiving trientine died during follow-up, 3 having shown initial neurologic deterioration. Neurologic and speech recovery during a 3-year follow-up period were quite good. CONCLUSION: Tetrathiomolybdate is a better choice than trientine for preserving neurologic function in patients who present with neurologic disease.
29381936	Genotype and clinical course in 2 Chinese Han siblings with Wilson disease presenting with isolated disabling premature osteoarthritis: A case report.	RATIONALE: Premature osteoarthritis (POA) is a rare condition in Wilson disease (WD). Particularly, when POA is the only complaint of a WD patient for a long time, there would be misdiagnosis or missed diagnosis and then treatment delay. PATIENT CONCERNS AND DIAGNOSIS: Two Chinese Han siblings were diagnosed as WD by corneal K-F rings, laboratory test, and mutation analysis. They presented with isolated POA during the first 2 decades or more of their disease course, and were of missed diagnosis during that long time. The older affected sib became disabled due to his severe osteoarthritis when he was as young as 38 years old. Two compound heterozygous pathogenic variants c.2790_2792del and c.2621C>T were revealed in the ATP7B gene through targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS). LESSONS: Adolescent-onset POA could be the only complaint of WD individual for at least 2 decades. Long delay in the treatment of WD's POA could lead to disability in early adulthood. Detailed physical examination, special biochemical test, and genotyping through targeted NGS should greatly reduce diagnosis delay in atypical WD patients with isolated POA phenotype.

20946468	Liver transplantation for children with Wilson disease: comparison of outcomes between children and adults.	UNLABELLED: Liver transplantation (LT) is lifesaving for patients with Wilson disease (WD) presenting with fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) or chronic liver disease (CLD) unresponsive to treatment. AIM: To determine the outcome of LT in pediatric and adult patients with WD. METHODS: United Network for Organ Sharing data on LT from 1987 to 2008 were analyzed. Outcomes were compared for patients requiring LT for FHF and CLD after 2002. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine risk factors for death and graft loss. RESULTS: Of 90,867 patients transplanted between 1987 and 2008, 170 children and 400 adults had WD. The one- and five-yr patient survival of children was 90.1% and 89% compared to 88.3% and 86% for adults, p = 0.53, 0.34. After 2002, 103 (41 children) were transplanted for FHF and 67 (10 children) for CLD. One- and five-yr patient survival was higher in children transplanted for CLD compared to FHF; 100%, 100% vs. 90%, 87.5% respectively, p = 0.30, 0.32. One- and five-yr patient survival was higher in adults transplanted for CLD compared to FHF; 94.7%, 90.1% vs. 90.3%, 89.7%, respectively, p = 0.36, 0.88. Encephalopathy, partial graft, and ventilator use were risk factors for death by logistic regression. CONCLUSION: LT is an excellent treatment option for patients with WD. Patients transplanted for CLD had higher patient survival rates than patients with FHF.
31161407	Idiopathic copper toxicosis: is abnormal copper metabolism a primary cause of this disease?	Idiopathic copper toxicosis (ICT) is characterized by marked copper deposition, Mallory-Denk body (MDB) formation and severe hepatic injury. Although the characteristics are apparently different from Wilson disease, large amounts of copper accumulate in the liver of the patients. We extensively treated a patient with ICT to reduce the body copper, however, the patient needed liver transplantation. Previous liver biopsy revealed high copper content. But extirpated liver contained an extremely small amount of copper, although MDBs and severe inflammation remained. These phenomena suggest abnormal copper metabolism is not the principle cause of ICT but some other abnormality must exist.
27496798	Prevalence and Significance of Autoantibodies in Children With Acute Liver Failure.	OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the present study is to estimate autoantibody (auto-AB) frequency, clinical characteristics, and 21-day outcome of participants in the Pediatric Acute Liver Failure Study Group (PALFSG) by antinuclear antibody, smooth muscle antibody, and liver-kidney microsomal (LKM) antibody status. METHODS: Auto-ABs were determined at local and/or central laboratories. Subjects were assigned to autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), indeterminate, and other diagnoses groups. RESULTS: Between 1999 and 2010, 986 subjects were enrolled in the PALFSG. At least 1 auto-AB result was available for 722 (73.2%). At least 1 auto-AB was positive for 202 (28.0%). Diagnoses for auto-AB+ subjects were AIH (63), indeterminate (75), and other (64). Auto-ABs were more common in Wilson disease (12/32, 37.5%) compared with other known diagnoses (52/253, 20.6%, P = 0.03). LKM+ subjects were younger (median 2.4 vs 9.1 years, P < 0.001) and more likely to undergo liver transplantation (53.3% vs 31.4% P = 0.02) than other auto-AB+/LKM- subjects. Steroid treatment of subjects who were auto-AB+ was not significantly associated with survival and the subgroup with known diagnoses other than AIH had a higher risk of death. CONCLUSIONS: Auto-ABs are common in children with acute liver failure, occurring in 28%. Auto-AB+ subjects have similar outcomes to auto-AB negative subjects. LKM+ children are younger and more likely to undergo liver transplantation compared with other auto-AB+ subjects. Although auto-AB may indicate a treatable condition, positivity does not eliminate the need for a complete diagnostic evaluation because auto-ABs are present in other conditions. The significance of auto-AB in pediatric acute liver failure remains uncertain, but LKM+ appears to identify a unique population of children who merit further study.
30359967	Plasmapheresis Combined with Continuous Plasma Filtration Adsorption Rescues Severe Acute Liver Failure in Wilson's Disease before Liver Transplantation.	Wilsonian crisis (hemolytic crisis and acute liver failure [ALF] in Wilson's disease) is fatal and almost all patients ultimately need a timely liver transplantation to save their lives. How to safely pass the critical period to liver transplantation is still a big challenge to doctors especially to pediatricians facing more difficult situations in blood purification. Here, we report about a 7-year-old child (weight 21 kg) presenting with severe hemolysis and impending ALF that made a rapid recovery with prompt initiation of plasmapheresis combined with continuous plasma filtration adsorption (CPFA) and chelation therapy. Rapidly efficient removal of copper, bilirubin, and albumin-binding toxins by hybrid blood purification alleviated hemolysis and liver injury and successfully bridged the patient over the critical period to late liver transplantation. Moreover, a review of the literature was performed examining the use of plasmapheresis, molecular adsorbent recirculation system, single-pass albumin dialysis, and continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration in Wilson disease. The experience of our case points to that plasmapheresis combined with CPFA treatment can improve clinical symptoms and bridge children over through Wilsonian crisis to late live transplantation, and CPFA treatment is feasible and safe in children weighing more than 20 kg.
19691525	De novo phyllodes tumor in an adolescent female after liver transplantation.	Phyllodes tumor of the breast is a rare disease constituting 0.3-0.9% of all breast neoplasms. Occurring mainly in females aged 35 to 55 yr, the disease is especially rare among adolescent females. There is no published literature about de novo phyllodes tumor after liver transplantation. Here we describe a case of de novo phyllodes tumors in an adolescent female after liver transplantation from a living donor for Wilson disease.
21453233	Leukoencephalopathy syndrome after living-donor liver transplantation.	OBJECTIVES: Leukoencephalopathy syndrome is a neurologic complication after organ transplantation caused predominantly by the neurotoxic effects of immunosuppressive agents on cerebral white matter. We determined the incidence and features of leukoencephalopathy syndrome in recipients after living-donor liver transplantations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively investigated 205 patients who had a living-donor liver transplantation performed at our institution between August 1998 and October 2008. RESULTS: Leukoencephalopathy syndrome developed in 7 of 205 patients (3.9%) and in 4.7% of the 150 patients treated with tacrolimus-based immunosuppression after their living-donor liver transplantation. The underlying diseases were alcoholic cirrhosis in 3 cases, viral cirrhosis in 2, biliary atresia in 1, and Wilson disease in 1. Time to clinical onset after tacrolimus medication was 15.6 days (range, 6-30 days). The neurologic symptoms included headache, confusion, myoclonus, seizures, and visual disturbances. The mean serum trough level of tacrolimus at clinical onset was not very high (11.7 ng/mL [range, 6.0-14.2 ng/mL]). T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging in all cases showed diffuse high signal in the white matter of the frontal, parieto-occipital, and temporal lobes. Treatment with antihypertensives, anticonvulsants, and withdrawal of tacrolimus resulted in amelioration of symptoms and magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities. Six patients showed complete recovery, while the seventh had residual rigidity and cognitive impairment caused by hypoxia during a convulsion. CONCLUSIONS: Tacrolimus neurotoxicity can occur despite low trough levels; it depends on variations in pharmacokinetics, such as absorption and maximum concentration level. Early diagnosis and treatment of leukoencephalopathy syndrome should contribute to complete remission.
28433103	Liver transplantation for Wilson disease.	Liver transplantation (LT) is a life-saving and curative treatment for Wilson disease (WD), providing restoration of function of the liver and mitigation of portal hypertension. Indications for LT in patients with WD include acute liver failure or end-stage liver disease not treatable by medical therapy. LT is also used to treat hepatocellular carcinoma when it develops in patients with WD when tumor resection is not feasible. LT solely for neurologic or psychiatric WD remains controversial. Living liver donation as well as cadaveric orthotopic and auxiliary LT are options for transplantation for WD. Outcomes for LT for WD are excellent, and supportive measures while awaiting transplantation help bridge the patient to a more successful outcome. Future hepatocyte or stem cell transplantation may augment or supplant current LT for WD.
23619327	Therapeutic plasma exchange in patients with neurological diseases: multicenter retrospective analysis.	Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE), is a procedure, changing pathologic substances in the plasma of patients with replacement fluid. TPE has an increasing list of indications in recent years such as neurological, connective tissue, hematological, nephrological, endocrinological and metabolic disorders. We report our multicenter data about therapeutic plasma exchange in patients with neurological diseases. Six University Hospitals' aphaeresis units medical records about neurologic diseases were reviewed retrospectively. Hundred and fifteen patients and 771 TPE sessions from six aphaeresis units' were included to this study. Of the 115 patients, 53 (46%) were men and 62 (54%) were women. The median age was 50 (range: 5-85) years. Of these patients 58.3% were Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), 17.4% were acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), 10.4% were chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP), 7% were multiple sclerosis, 6.1% were myasthenia gravis (MG) and 0.9% were Wilson disease (WD). The median number of TPE sessions per patient was 5 (range 1-72). Human albumin was used as a replacement fluid in 66% and fresh frozen plasma was used in 34% of cases. TPE was done through central venous catheters in 66%, and peripheral venous access in 34% of patients. Some complications were seen in patients (18.3%) during TPE sessions. These complications were, complications related to catheter placement procedure (8.7%), hypotension (3.5%), hypocalcaemia (3.5%) and allergic reactions (1.7%). The complication ratios were 2.7% in total 771 TPE procedures. TPE procedure was terminated in 6% of sessions depending on these complications. Overall responses to TPE were noted in 89.5% of patients. In conclusion; Therapeutic plasma exchange is an effective treatment option in several neurologic diseases.
7992028	[Results of liver transplantations in Geneva or 32 consecutive transplantations without mortality in 2 years].	Between 1 january 1992 and 31 december 1993, 32 liver transplantations were performed in 29 patients (5 transplants in 3 children and 27 transplants in 26 adults) at Geneva University Hospital. Despite 5 super-urgent transplantations (3 fulminant hepatitis, 1 end-stage Wilson disease and 1 primary nonfunction), all patients are still alive and all have lived more than 10 months. On 1 october 1994, all patients were at home and 93% were in good general condition. No patient of this series had been transplanted for cancer and all patients positive for hepatitis B surface antigen receive long-term administration of anti-HBs immune globulin: in this respect, the long-term mortality risk of the present series of patients seems to be very low. Although these results highlight that liver transplantation can be performed safely by a competent medico-surgical team, two significant difficulties have to be outlined. First, patients are likely to die on the waiting list due to unavailable grafts, especially in emergency cases. Second, the postoperative period of patients with decompensated end-stage liver disease at the time of liver transplantation is still one of high morbidity. These facts underline that chronic liver disease patient should be evaluated for liver transplantation prior to the terminal decompensated stage of the disease, when the candidate's invariably poor general condition precludes successful liver transplantation.
30635331	MR Imaging of the Brain in Neurologic Wilson Disease.	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Neurologic Wilson disease is an inherited disease characterized by a copper metabolic disorder that causes damage to many organs, especially the brain. Few studies report the relationships between these neurologic symptoms and MR imaging of the brain. Therefore, we investigated the correlation of brain abnormalities in patients with neurologic Wilson disease with their clinical symptoms, age of onset, and lag time to diagnosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cohort of 364 patients was recruited in China between January 2003 and December 2017. Age of onset, lag time until diagnosis, and neurologic symptoms were recorded, and cranial MR imaging was performed. Patients were divided into groups within each of these factors for correlation analysis with the MR imaging brain scans. RESULTS: Abnormal signals in the MR imaging brain scans were seen in all 364 cases. Affected regions included the putamen, pons, midbrain, and thalamus, while the medulla and occipital lobe were unaffected. The putamen was the most frequently damaged brain region in this study. With the age of onset younger than 10 years, cranial MR imaging scans showed only impairment in the putamen. Patients with a longer lag time before diagnosis were more likely to have impairment in the pons, midbrain, and cortex. Among neurologic symptoms of Wilson disease, torsion spasm is associated with the midbrain and cortex, and choreoathetosis is related to the caudate nucleus. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormalities in the putamen, pons, midbrain, and thalamus are part of the neuroimaging spectrum of Wilson disease. There is a significant correlation between the site of brain injury and diagnosis lag time.
19595231	[Probing into indication of living-related liver transplantation for Wilson's disease].	OBJECTIVE: To probe into indication of living-related liver transplantation (LRLT) for Wilson's Disease. METHODS: From January 2001 to February 2007, thirty-seven living-related liver transplants were performed. A retrospective analysis was carried on outcome of those patients. The indications for LRLT were acute hepatic failure in 3 patients and chronic advanced liver disease in 32 patients including 13 patients with Wilsonian neurological manifestations. Two patients presented with severe Wilsonian neurological manifestations even though their liver functions were stable. According to the scoring system for evaluation of the neurological impairment in Wilson disease based on neurological signs and functions (total score was 30), the pre-transplantation score of those patients with neurological manifestations was 15.9 +/- 4.3 (n = 15). RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients were followed up for 20 - 93 months. The survival rates of post-transplant patients and grafts at 1, 3, and 5 year were 91.9%, 83.8%, 75.7%, and 86.5%, 78.4%, 75.7%, respectively. Postoperative surgical complications occurred in 2 donors with bile leakage required drainage, in 2 recipients with hepatic thrombosis underwent retransplantation of cadaveric liver and in 1 recipient with hepatic stenosis required balloon dilatation. Neurological function was improved in all recipients and the score of posttransplantation at 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 month was 17.5 +/- 3.7 (n = 13); 21.0 +/- 4.3 (n = 12); 23.9 +/- 3.9 (n = 10); 26.6 +/- 2.2 (n = 10) and 28.1 +/- 1.9 (n = 7) respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with acute hepatic failure or patients with severe liver disease unresponsive to chelation treatment should be treated with LRLT. Early transplantation in patients with an unsatisfactory response medical treatment may prevent irreversible neurological deterioration even though their liver function is stable.
20489626	Liver transplantation for inherited metabolic disorders of the liver.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Liver transplantation is curative, life saving or both for a range of inherited diseases affecting the liver. Indications, timing and outcome of transplantation for these diseases are the focus of this review. RECENT FINDINGS: Liver transplant represents a mode of gene replacement therapy for several disorders, including Wilson disease, hemochromatosis, tyrosinemia, urea cycle defects and hypercholesterolemia in which the primary defect residing in the liver results in hepatic complications or severe extrahepatic disease. Liver transplant is also an important therapeutic modality in multisystemic genetic disorders with major hepatic disease such as glycogen storage disease types I, III and IV and porphyria. For familial amyloidosis and primary hyperoxaluria, liver replacement eliminates the source of the injurious products that results in extrahepatic disease. Innovations in medical and surgical management of these patients have led to improved outcomes providing an important benchmark for future gene therapy of these disorders. SUMMARY: Recent developments have refined the indications for liver transplant in the treatment of inherited metabolic diseases. The full potential of liver transplant in these disorders can be harnessed by careful patient selection, optimizing timing and perioperative metabolic management of these patients.
24635804	Cutaneous disorders in liver transplant recipients.	OBJECTIVES: This study sought to analyze the incidence and risk factors of skin complications in liver transplant recipients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with skin biopsies were selected from 408 liver transplant recipients from January 1990 to December 2012 at Baskent University in Ankara, Turkey. Demographic and clinical findings including age, sex, primary liver disease, immunosuppressive therapy, and the time between transplant and cutaneous lesions were examined. RESULTS: There were 38 patients who had skin biopsy after liver transplantation. The mean age at transplantation was 30.5 years. The primary liver disease was hepatocellular carcinoma second to viral hepatitis in 15 patients, Wilson disease in 7 patients, cryptogenic cirrhosis in 3, familial hypercholesterolemia in 3 patients, and 1 each patients of Byler disease, Caroli disease, tyrosinemia, Budd-Chiari syndrome, congenital hepatic fibrosis, alcoholic cirrhosis, and biliary atresia. The primary disease in 3 patients were unknown. The histologic diagnosis included precancerous and cancerous lesions (n=4), infectious diseases (n=4); xanthomatous lesions (n=4); vasculopathic lesions (n=4); melanocytic lesions (n=4); benign adnexial tumors (n=2); skin atrophy (n=2); calcinosis cutis (n=2), keratinous cyst (n=2), neutrophilic dermatosis (n=2), perivascular dermatitis (n=2) and miscellaneous lesions (n=6). CONCLUSIONS: We presented the cutaneous manifestations in liver transplant recipients. The most common skin lesion in these patients were precancerous and cancerous lesions, infectious, xanthomatous, and melanocytic lesions. The findings emphasize the importance of dermatologic screening in these patients that can provide early diagnosis and a better quality of life.
15561202	Do patients with acute liver failure have a better chance to receive liver grafting?	OBJECTIVE: Patients with acute hepatic failure (AHF) were always given first priority on the transplant waiting list. We investigated whether AHF patients will deprive other patients on the waiting list of the chance of liver transplantation (LTx). METHODS AND RESULTS: From January 1999 to March 2003, a total of 423 patients were on the transplant waiting list at the National Taiwan University Hospital. Sixty-five of the patients had AHF caused by hepatitis-B-related disease (HBV, n = 52, 80%), Wilson disease (n = 3, 4.6%), drug-induced AHF (n = 3, 4.6%), and other causes (n = 7, 10.8%).Thirty-three patients died and 16 survived by medical treatment. Two received LTx abroad and 14 underwent LTx at our hospital (7 living-related; 7 cadaver). A total of 140 patients died while waiting for a transplant during the period studied. Of them, 107 were among 358 non-AHF patients (30%), and time-to-death interval was 133 +/- 175 days (median: 62); 33 were among 65 AHF patients (51%); time to death was 19 +/- 28 days (median: 8). There were 35 cadaver donor livers available during the period; 28 of 358 non-AHF patients (7.8%), and 7 of 65 AHF patients (10.7%) received cadaveric LTx. Their waiting time totaled 342 +/- 316 and 12 +/- 9 days, respectively (P < .0001). CONCLUSION: Most AHF patients died unless they received liver grafts. Even with a higher priority assigned to them, AHF patients still have little chance to get a cadaver donor liver in Taiwan, and non-AHF patients have an even slimmer chance. Therefore, we need to encourage liver donation from living-related donors.
21415672	Prognostic scoring indices in Wilson disease: a case series and cautionary tale.	OBJECTIVES: In children with acute presentations of Wilson disease (WD), liver transplantation may be the only effective therapy. The Wilson Index is a prognostic index used to determine the risk of death without transplant in WD. We sought to determine the accuracy of this system in our own patient population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The clinical course of patients diagnosed as having acute WD seen at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center between 2003 and 2008 was reviewed. RESULTS: Six patients were identified; their index scores ranged from 7 to 13, with 3 patients receiving a score predictive of death without transplantation (>= 10). Of those 3, 1 underwent transplantation and 2 survived without transplant. The latter 2 have been removed from the transplant waitlist. In all, 5 patients were listed for transplantation, and 2 of the 5 received prioritized status 1A listing. Only 2 of the 5 patients went to transplantation, and neither was status 1A at the time of transplant. CONCLUSIONS: Prognostic scoring systems, although useful, may not be entirely accurate. Likewise, aggressive utilization of status 1 prioritization may result in unnecessary transplants and misallocation of a rare resource. However, deferring status 1 prioritization may yield an incomplete response to therapy and preclude lifesaving transplantation. Continued investigation of predictors of outcome in WD is necessary.
3912072	[Liver transplantation in children].	Liver transplantation has become a clinical therapeutic modality for end stage liver diseases. The results achieved in children are better than in adults: in T.E. Starzl unique experience in Pittsburgh, USA, the survival rate at one and four years are 75 and 70% respectively. Complete rehabilitation of these children can nowadays be expected. Between March 1984 and June 1985, 8 children received an orthotopic liver transplantation at the University of Louvain Medical School in Brussels, Belgium; one child received two transplantations after acute and irreversible rejection of a first ABO incompatible graft. The indications were biliary atresia in five (polysplenia in one), biliary hypoplasia in one, alpha-1-antitrypsine deficiency in one and Crigler-Najjar syndrome type I in one. The age of the patients at the time of liver replacement was 12 to 18 months in four, 8 to 13 years in four. Six patients are alive after 17, 14, 12, 10, 3 and 3 months; the two youngest children deceased during the first postoperative month. The Kaplan-Meyer one year survival rate is 75%; all surviving children are in excellent clinical condition with a normal liver function. The 9 transplanted livers were harvested from multiorgan cerebral death donors with the exception of one neonate whose liver alone was removed; 4 were retrieved locally, the five others were offered by foreign hospitals through the organ procurement agencies (Eurotransplant, France-Transplant, U.K. Transplant). Due to appropriate logistics with air flight transportation of the harvesting team when indicated, the total ischaemia time was kept below 6 hours in every case. Two small children underwent a left lobe orthotopic transplantation after ex vivo right trisegmentectomy of the liver retrieved from an older donor with one long term survival. The indications for liver transplantation in children are end-stage liver diseases consisting of a) cholestatic diseases among which the most frequent is biliary atresia after unsuccessful Kasai procedure followed by familial cholestasis (Byler syndrome) and the paucity of the intrahepatic bile ducts of the syndromatic (Alagille syndrome) or non syndromatic type. b) the metabolic diseases resulting either in cirrhosis with liver failure (alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, Wilson disease, glycogen storage disease type I and IV, protoporphyria) or in extrahepatic complications of enzymatic deficiency of an otherwise normally functioning liver (Crigler-Najjar syndrome type I, familial hypercholesterolemia and perhaps oxalosis). c) the hepatocellular diseases either chronic with cirrhosis of various origin or acute, eg. toxic hepatitis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
34908013	Re-evaluation of King Wilson Index in Children With Acutely Decompensated Hepatic Wilson Disease.	OBJECTIVES: Liver transplantation (LT) in Wilson disease (WD) is a life-saving option for patients presenting with liver failure and encephalopathy. Patients without encephalopathy can avoid LT and treated successfully with chelation therapy. It is essential to predict the risk of fatal outcomes where LT is required. We aim to critically analyse the validity of the WD Index prospectively from a cohort of WD patients managed at our institution. METHODS: WD Index and other clinical data from 2005 to 2018, recorded prospectively as part of clinical management, were analysed. RESULTS: Over 13-year period, 52 children with WD (29 boys) with median age at diagnosis of 11.69 (range 3.92-17.26) years were studied. Of these, 17 were diagnosed as part of family screening, 17 presented with abnormal liver enzyme, and 18 with acute hepatic decompensation (AHD) as per PALF definition. Patients presented with abnormal liver enzyme and in the pre-symptomatic group had WD Index <11, and none of them required LT. WD Index is still a good predictor for LT in WD patients with AHD, providing a sensitivity of 80%, specificity of 100%, positive-predictive, and negative-predictive value of 100% and 80%, respectively. Patients presented with an index of 8-10 also required LT at median duration of 58 days (IQR 48-135 days). CONCLUSIONS: WD patients presenting with AHD who had an index of >=11 do require LT. Children with a WD Index of 8 to 10 within the first 2 months of admission require close monitoring as LT may become necessary.
20013564	Wilson's disease: monocentric experiences over a period of 10 years [corrected].	BACKGROUND: Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism. The objective of this study is to present diagnostic pitfalls and long time follow-up data in Wilson disease. PATIENTS/METHODS: We studied 21 WD patients and 14 heterozygote carriers aged 2-43 years, retrospectively. 18 WD patients presented liver disease, three had mixed neurological and hepatic involvement and 9 patients underwent orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). RESULTS: The median age at diagnosis of WD children without OLT was 10.16+/-3.8 (range, 5-16). All of females and younger age categories of patients prevailed in acute liver failure group. Serum ceruloplasmine levels were below 0.2 g/l in about (1/3) of WD carriers (X =0.27+/-0.09 g/l) and nearly (2/3) of children with WD (X = 0.21+/-0.13 g/l). A statistically significant difference (p<0.05) in the 24-h excretion of copper in urine was noticed between healthy controls, children with WD and WD heterozygote carriers. As diagnostic important proved the copper content of more than 250 microg/g hepatic dry weight. The Kayser-Fleischer?s ring was not observed in children. Ceruloplasmine, haemoglobin, ALT, ALP and plasma albumin were significantly different between fulminant and non-fulminant WD and could be used as indirect markers in evaluation of urgent OLT. CONCLUSION: Detection of WD in children remains very difficult. The most important investigation is liver biopsy with the assessment of liver copper. Genetic analysis may help in doubtful cases.
17713430	Live donor liver transplantation for acute liver failure.	BACKGROUND: Acute liver failure (ALF) carries a high mortality unless urgent orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is performed on time. Live donors are utilized to treat this irreversible condition first in pediatric cases and then in adults. Herein, we aimed to report our experience with live donors for ALF in a country of a deceased donor organ donation rate is only 1.5 per million people. METHODS: Among the 245 live donor liver transplantations (LDLT) performed from June 1999 to December 2005, 14 of them (6%) were performed for ALF in 8 pediatric and 6 adult cases. Right lobes were harvested for the adult cases whereas left lateral segments were harvested for pediatric cases, except one child transplanted with a right lobe graft. The etiology of the disease was; acute hepatitis B in four cases, hepatitis A in three cases, Wilson disease two cases, autoimmune hepatitis in two cases, and was unknown in three cases. RESULTS: Three-year graft and patient survival is 79% for these series. Five of the six adult patients and six of the eight pediatric cases survived after transplantation. There was not any donor mortality or major morbidity. CONCLUSIONS: LDLT offers a safe and effective modality of treatment for ALF for both pediatric and adult patients to overcome the problem of organ shortage especially in countries where the chance of receiving an organ from a deceased donor is low.
23109455	Response to different therapeutic approaches in Wilson disease. A long-term follow up study.	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: There are certain areas of uncertainty regarding the best therapeutic approach in patients diagnosed with Wilson Disease (WD). Our aim was to assess treatment response to different therapies in a cohort of WD patients followed in a single center. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is an observational, descriptive study in which clinical, laboratory and imaging data are reviewed in a series of 20 WD patients with a median follow-up of 14 years. Type of presentation, treatment used, biochemical and copper homeostasis parameters were elicited. RESULTS: Median age at diagnosis was 22 years. The most frequent form of presentation was hepatic (n = 10, 50%; mean age: 21.5 years), followed by neurological (25%; mean age: 34.5 years) and mixed (15%). The initial treatment in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients at diagnosis was d-penicillamine in 90% and Zinc (Zn) in 10%, respectively. Patients who were maintained on d-penicillamine for the whole period had complete biochemical normalization (baseline ALT: 220 IU/l; last follow up 38 IU/l). In contrast, patients in whom d-penicillamine was switched to Zn, irrespective of the cause, did not show a complete biochemical remission (baseline ALT: 100 IU/l vs. 66 IU/l at last follow-up). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment was found to be effective in most cases regardless of the drug used. However, side effects were common in those treated with d-penicillamine agents, and required switching to zinc. Therapy with zinc was well tolerated and appeared to have a good efficacy. However, in 33%, a complete normalization of liver enzymes was never reached.
15701295	Wilson disease: new insights into pathogenesis, diagnosis, and future therapy.	Wilson disease is caused by disease-specific mutations of the copper transporting ATPase, ATP7B. The diagnosis is established by clinical and biochemical means, though advances in molecular diagnostics will someday permit de novo diagnosis. The patient may present with hepatic, neurologic, or psychiatric symptoms, or a combination of these. Both environmental and extragenic effects contribute to the varied phenotypic presentations of this disease. Patients can be treated effectively with chelating agents or zinc salts, or with liver transplantation. Liver cell transplant and gene therapy offer potential cures for this disorder, but at present only data from preclinical studies on animal models are available. Future advances in immunotolerization and gene therapy will likely enable human trials for treatment of this disorder and other genetic disorders of hepatic metabolism.
37347440	Pediatric Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure.	Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is characterized by an acute hepatic insult happening in a patient with underlying cirrhosis with compromised hepatic reserve leading to development of systemic inflammation, sepsis, and organ failure resulting in poor outcome in majority. While Asia Pacific Association for Study of Liver Diseases (APASL) emphasizes on early diagnosis before development of organ failure, European Association for Study of Liver Diseases (EASL) mandates the presence of organ failures to define ACLF. There is a lack of consensus definition of pediatric ACLF although recent APASL guidelines have tried to address the issue. While Wilson disease (WD) and autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) are the most common cause of underlying cirrhosis in children, acute viral hepatitis and flares of WD and AIH are the commonest acute precipitating events. Poor outcomes [death and liver transplantation (LT)] ranging from 19 to 59% have been reported. Prognosis in pediatric ACLF is usually better than that in adults due to greater proportion of treatable etiologies, lesser organ failures, comorbidities and better hepatic reserves. APASL ACLF Research Consortium (AARC) score more than or equal to 11 is predictive of poor 28-90 d mortality. Treatment of pediatric ACLF relies mainly on prompt diagnosis and medical management of a potentially treatable etiology of underlying cirrhosis. Bridging therapies, especially high volume plasma exchange can be initiated early as a bridge to LT or native liver recovery. Those with no improvement in 4-7 d should undergo LT before development of sepsis or multi-organ failure.
32398357	Liver transplantation as a rescue therapy for severe neurologic forms of Wilson disease.	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of liver transplantation (LT) in patients with Wilson disease (WD) with severe neurologic worsening resistant to active chelation. METHODS: French patients with WD who underwent LT for pure neurologic indication were retrospectively studied. Before LT and at the last follow-up, neurologic impairment was evaluated with the Unified Wilson's Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS) score, disability with the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score, and hepatic function with the Model for End-stage Liver Disease score, together with the presence of a Kayser-Fleischer ring (KFR), brain MRI scores, and copper balance. The survival rate and disability at the last follow-up were the coprimary outcomes; evolution of KFR and brain MRI were the secondary outcomes. Prognosis factors were further assessed. RESULTS: Eighteen patients had LT. All were highly dependent before LT (median mRS score 5). Neurologic symptoms were severe (median UWDRS score 105), dominated by dystonia and parkinsonism. The cumulated survival rate was 88.8% at 1 year and 72.2% at 3 and 5 years. At the last follow-up, 14 patients were alive. Their mRS and UWDRS scores improved (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0003). Eight patients had a major improvement (78% decrease of the UWDRS score), 4 a moderate one (41% decrease), and 2 a stable status. KFR and brain MRI scores improved (p = 0.0007). Severe sepsis (p = 0.011) and intensive care unit admission (p = 0.001) before LT were significantly associated with death. CONCLUSIONS: LT is a rescue therapeutic option that should be carefully discussed in selected patients with neurologic WD resistant to anticopper therapies (chelators or zinc salts) as it might allow patients to gain physical independency with a reasonable risk. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class IV evidence that for patients with WD with severe neurologic worsening resistant to active pharmacologic therapy, LT might decrease neurologic impairment.
31653639	Wilson disease: a diagnostic challenge in a patient with alcoholic liver disease.	A 32-year-old man with alcoholic cirrhosis presented with worsening abdominal distension and jaundice. He was diagnosed with cirrhosis 2 years prior after a hospitalisation for acute liver failure, during which viral, autoimmune and metabolic workup was unrevealing. Heavy alcohol consumption was his only obvious risk factor for liver disease, so his decompensation was attributed to alcohol. At the present time, he was admitted with acute-on-chronic liver failure and acute renal failure. The severity of his presentation and the disproportionately mild elevation in alkaline phosphatase relative to his hyperbilirubinaemia prompted repeating a ceruloplasmin level, which, though previously normal, was now low, and eventually led to a diagnosis of Wilson disease (WD) with concomitant alcoholic liver disease. Clinicians must recognise limitations in ceruloplasmin and copper levels when screening for WD and maintain suspicion for WD in young patients, even if there is an already established aetiology of liver disease.
24458219	Effect of molecular adsorbents recirculating system treatment in children with acute liver failure caused by Wilson disease.	OBJECTIVES: Because fulminant Wilson disease (WD) has an extremely poor prognosis, the use of liver support that can bridge patients to liver transplantation is lifesaving. We report the experience of albumin dialysis in acute liver failure (ALF) caused by WD in children. METHODS: Chart review of children admitted for ALF secondary to acute WD and treated by the molecular adsorbents and recirculating system. Measures of copper level in blood and within the circuit during molecular adsorbents recirculating system (MARS) sessions were performed. Clinical and biological assessments after MARS session were reported. RESULTS: Four children, with a median age of 12.3 years, were treated from 2004 to 2009 for a severe ALF associated with acute renal failure, haemolysis, and severe cholestasis. All of the children had a new Wilson index >12. A total of 14 MARS sessions were performed, for a median duration of 7.5 hours. Tolerance was good, except for 1 child who experienced haemorrhage because of vascular injury following insertion of the dialysis catheter. A neurological improvement or stabilisation was noted in all of the children along with an improvement in the Fisher index and ammonia level after MARS treatment. MARS was able to remove copper, to decrease the serum copper level of 28% in mean, and to decrease the bilirubin and creatinin levels >25%. All of the children were subsequently underwent liver transplants with a good outcome without disability. CONCLUSIONS: MARS is able to remove copper and to stabilise children with ALF secondary to WD, allowing bridging to LT.
27407047	Liver: Novel therapeutic strategy for Wilson disease.	
22093921	Successful liver transplantation following veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in a child with fulminant Wilson disease and severe pulmonary hemorrhage: a case report.	Massive pulmonary hemorrhage and other serious cardiopulmonary diseases in patients with fulminant hepatitis result not only in graft failure but also mortality after LT. ECMO is used to treat children with cardiorespiratory failure refractory to conventional intensive care. We describe a five-yr-old girl with genetically confirmed fulminant Wilson disease and severe pulmonary hemorrhage who underwent successful primary LT following veno-arterial ECMO. To our knowledge, this is the first report of successful primary LT in a patient using veno-arterial ECMO. The present case demonstrates that ECMO, as a bridging modality to LT, may be necessary to manage both massive pulmonary hemorrhage and possible graft loss because of hypoxemia.
30701819	The first experience of non-interferon therapy of HCV infection in patients with Wilson-Konovalov's disease.	In the article we present three clinical observations demonstrating that HCV infection in patients with remission of Wilson disease causes an recrudescence of the disease, in one of the observations - decompensation of liver cirrhosis. In this study we first describe on the successful treatment of HCV infection with direct antiviral drugs in patients with Wilson disease. Establishment of all factors of liver damage and successful treatment (elimination of the virus, adequate lifelong medical treatment) allow to expect a favorable prognosis in patients with a combination of Wilson disease and HCV infection.
31474637	[Diagnosis and treatment of Wilson disease in Japan].	Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive disorder based on inborn error of copper metabolism. The copper accumulates in the liver, brain, cornea, kidney, and other organs. This disease should be considered any individual with liver abnormality except infant, any patient older than teenage with neurological (especially for extra pyramidal signs) or neuropsychiatric disorder with or without liver disease and sibling of Wilson disease patient. Typically, a combination of low serum ceruloplasmine levels and high levels of urinary copper contents is sufficient to establish a diagnosis. As other diagnostic tests, measurement of hepatic copper content and ATP7B gene analysis are available. The key strategy of treatment is to reduce the amount of copper in the liver and other tissues by administering both copper-chelating agents, such as D-penicillamine or Trientine, and/or zinc acetate. The author recommend zinc acetate monotherapy for mild to moderate hepatic disorder, Trientine mono therapy for mild to moderate neurologic disorder and combination therapy of Trientine and zinc acetate for sever hepatic or neurologic disorder.
20955957	Wilson disease.	Wilson disease is an inherited autosomal recessive disorder of copper balance leading to hepatic damage and neurological disturbance of variable degree. The defective gene, ATP7B, encodes a hepatic copper-transporting protein, which plays a key role in human copper metabolism. Our knowledge of the genetic basis of Wilson disease has increased dramatically; however, understanding of genotype-phenotype correlation and multifarious effects of copper toxicity as basis for targeted and individualised therapy strategies is still insufficient. Clinical manifestations are related to copper accumulation predominantly in the liver and brain and include hepatic disease ranging from mild hepatitis to acute liver failure or cirrhosis and/or neurological symptoms such as dystonia, tremor, dysarthria, psychiatric disturbances. Mixed presentations occur frequently. Early recognition by means of clinical, biochemical or genetic examination and initiation of therapy with copper chelators, zinc salts or even liver transplantation in cases of acute and chronic liver failure are essential for favourable outcome.
24166573	Acute focal dystonia induced by a tricyclic antidepressant in a patient with Wilson disease: a case report.	The authors present the case of a 19-year-old patient with Wilson disease (WD) who developed symptoms of acute focal dystonia of the left hand (a 'starfish' hand presentation) shortly after treatment with the tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine. The diagnosis of WD was made 8 months earlier based on abnormal copper metabolism parameters and was confirmed by genetic testing. Initially, the patient presented with akathisia, sialorrhea, oromandibular dystonia (occasionally grimacing) and slight dysarthria. The patient's symptoms diminished after treatment with d-penicillamine was initiated. No further deterioration was observed after copper-chelating therapy was started. The authors diagnosed acute focal dystonia induced by clomipramine. Botulinum toxin and intensive rehabilitation was initiated; complete regression of hand dystonia was observed. Based on the case, the authors suggest that care should be exercised with regard to starting medications that could potentially impact the extrapyramidal system in WD patients. 
23503979	[Wilson's disease in the child: apropos of 20 cases].	
32314442	Retrospective analysis of long-term outcome 10 years after liver transplantation for Wilson disease: experience over three decades.	We evaluated long-term outcomes for patients with Wilson disease (WD) after liver transplantation (LT) and searched for risk factors for poor survival. Retrospective analysis of UNOS/OPTN data identified 156 pediatric and 515 adult cases of LT for WD between 1987 and 2016. Comparison cases were 10 442 pediatric and 104 874 adult non-WD transplant recipients. Survival was calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Recipient, donor, and surgical variables were compared by Cox regression. Survival rates 3, 5, and 10 years after LT for adult WD patients (87.5%, 85.4%, and 80.5%, respectively) were significantly higher than those for non-WD patients (P < 0.001); survival rates for pediatric WD patients (90.5%, 89.7%, and 86.5%, respectively) did not differ significantly from non-WD patients. Graft survival in adult and pediatric patients followed similar trends. Regression analysis identified older age, female gender, and use of life support at the time of transplant as risk factors for decreased survival for adults with WD, and younger age, male gender, obesity, and high serum creatinine at the time of transplant as risk factors for poor survival in pediatric recipients with WD. Presentation with fulminant liver failure was not associated with survival in WD patients. No donor characteristic predicted poor survival. Long-term patient and graft survival after LT is excellent for both adult and pediatric WD patients.
33197948	[Retrospective cross-sectional study based on nationwide data of drug prescriptions and contractional data of outpatient offices regarding Morbus Wilson's disease].	INTRODUCTION:  In this article, the prevalence of the Morbus Wilson disease in Germany is determined. This is based on nationwide data of drug prescriptions and contractional data of outpatient offices. The prevalence is set in ratio to the found prevalence of prescriptions in Germany. METHOD:  The descriptive evaluation is based on the database of the Central Research Institute of Ambulatory Health Care (Zi) in Germany. Additionally, data of the Federal Office of Statistics regarding inpatient treatment are available. RESULTS:  It can be seen that there is a notable difference between the prevalence of patients undergoing therapy and the patients with verified diagnoses. In total, prevalence is increasing. The incidence on hand and the given dynamic of the patient population could indicate that, possibly, there is an increased rate of misdiagnosis in the first year of diagnosis. According to data, the hepatic form is the more often diagnosed form. The human genetic diagnostic increases, on average, are most distinct. ATTRIBUTES:  Wilson Disease, Prevalence, Incidence, Trientine, Trientintetrahydrochlorid, D-Penicillamin, Zinc acetat, Zinc.
28433104	Wilson disease: symptomatic liver therapy.	Wilson disease leads to symptomatic impairment of liver function or liver cirrhosis. Strict adherence to decoppering agents is essential in these patients. Secondary prevention of additional hepatic damage by avoidance of other toxic substances (e.g., alcohol, drugs) and sufficient calorie intake is recommended. Routine examinations in cirrhotic patients include screening for signs of portal hypertension (esophagus varices), development of ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy. Where varices are present, primary or secondary preventive interventions may include treatment with nonselective beta-blockers or variceal ligation, similar to the approach in patients with liver cirrhosis due to other etiologies. For patients presenting with ascites, diuretics are the treatment of choice. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis can be diagnosed by paracentesis and should be treated with antibiotics. Liver cirrhosis can also lead to accumulation of neurotoxins causing hepatic encephalopathy. It is characterized by unspecific neuropsychiatric impairment and is treated with laxatives and nonresorbable antibiotics. The best prophylaxis is regular defecation. Patients with liver cirrhosis are susceptible for bacterial infections of any cause and sepsis is one of the leading causes of death in these patients. In advanced stages of cirrhosis renal function impairment is a common feature. The hepatorenal syndrome shows a high mortality. Where Wilson disease patients have decompensated liver cirrhosis, liver transplantation should be evaluated.
37204330	Factors affecting activities of daily living among patients with Wilson disease.	Wilson disease (WD) is a congenital copper metabolism disorder with various manifestations and can be treated with oral medication. This study examined the factors related to decline in activities of daily living (ADL) in patients with WD as research in this area remains limited. We enrolled 308 patients with WD, including patients who participated in a national survey and those who sought cares at the Department of Pediatrics, Toho University Ohashi Medical Center, from 2016 to 2017. We analyzed the association between ADL decline and factors including age at diagnosis, period from diagnosis to survey, hepatic symptoms, neurological signs, and psychiatric presentation at diagnosis. The relative risks (RRs) for ADL decline were estimated for each factor using multivariate modified Poisson regression analysis. Overall, 97 out of 308 (31.5%) patients experienced ADL decline. After adjusting for explanatory variables, regression analysis revealed that factors significantly associated with ADL decline were a period of >=20 years from diagnosis to survey (adjusted RR = 2.34, 95% CI: 1.47-3.74), hepatic symptoms with splenomegaly (adjusted RR = 2.57, 95% CI: 1.26-5.24), mild neurological signs (adjusted RR = 3.20, 95% CI: 1.96-5.23), and severe neurological signs (adjusted RR = 3.63, 95% CI: 2.28-5.77). Neurological signs, hepatic symptoms with splenomegaly, and a period of 20 years from diagnosis to survey are associated with ADL decline. Thus, careful assessment of patients for these factors is necessary, and these findings may guide future efforts to improve patient prognosis. Neurological signs, hepatic symptoms with splenomegaly, and a period of 20 years from diagnosis to survey are associated with a decline in activities of daily living in patients with Wilson disease.

14669425	[Pregnancy, delivery and puerperium in patients after liver transplantation].	We report two cases of successful pregnancies in women after liver transplantation for end-stage liver dysfunction caused in one case by Wilson disease and in the second one by lupoid hepatitis. For woman with the Wilson disease it was a second pregnancy and for woman with lupoid hepatitis it was the first pregnancy. Mothers continued immunosuppressive therapy during their pregnancies. Labours started spontaneously at 39th and 36th week's of gestation. As a result the healthy two female infants weighing 3600 g and 2420 g respectively were born. The first woman with her baby was discharged from hospital on the third day after delivery and the second one and her baby on the sixth day after delivery. Both were in good condition.
19574022	[Fulminant and subfulminant hepatitis: causes and treatment].	Fulminant hepatitis is an emergency because within a few hours, the physician must find the cause of the hepatitis (not identified in 15 to 20% of cases), rule out any contraindication to liver transplantation, verify that it is indicated, and prevent and/or treat the complications associated with liver failure. Viruses (especially hepatitis viruses A and B), drugs, and toxic agents are the most common causes of fulminant hepatitis, with the proportions varying between countries. Hepatitis viruses, the leading cause through 1995-1996, have fallen behind drugs and in particular paracetamol, which is now the leading cause of this disease in Europe and in the United States. There are also other rarer causes: other viruses (e.g., herpes virus HSV1 or 2, hepatitis virus E, parvovirus B19, and chickenpox-herpes zoster), Wilson Disease, acute Budd-Chiari and Reyes syndromes, autoimmune hepatitis, neoplastic infiltration of the liver, hypoxic hepatitis, heatstroke, acute pregnancy-related steatosis, and the HELLP syndrome. Prognosis is essentially determined by neurological status, but is also affected very rapidly by damage to other organs. Liver transplantation has revolutionized the prognosis of fulminant hepatitis, causing survival to increase from 10-20% (all causes combined) to 75-80% at 1 year and 70% at 5 years. These patients can be treated only in specialized centers with access to liver transplantation and to different modern means of liver resuscitation (hypothermia, artificial liver support, albumin dialysis, monitoring intracranial pressure and cerebral perfusion, etc.) -all from the onset of the disease.
17285615	Therapeutic plasmapheresis as a bridge to liver transplantation in fulminant Wilson disease.	Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism that leads to the accumulation of copper mainly in the liver, cornea, brain, and kidney. Rarely, Wilson disease can present as fulminant hepatic failure with direct antiglobulin test-negative hemolytic anemia and renal failure. In the absence of liver transplantation, this disease is uniformly fatal because medical therapy is ineffective. This report describes the successful use of plasmapheresis for a patient with fulminant Wilson disease as a bridge to transplantation. Five daily therapeutic plasmapheresis procedures using fresh frozen plasma as a replacement fluid were performed over 6 days. Serum copper, urinary copper excretion, and hemolysis were significantly reduced and renal function improved. The patient's clinical status improved and she remained clinically stable until a liver transplant was possible. Plasmapheresis can be a successful medical treatment in fulminant Wilson disease and should be considered as a therapeutic measure to stabilize a patient by decreasing serum copper, reducing hemolysis, and helping to prevent renal tubular injury from copper and copper complexes until liver transplantation is possible.
1345101	Orthotopic liver transplantation in liver-based metabolic disorders.	The efficacy of orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) in the management of more common liver-based metabolic disorders associated with severe liver damage, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (PIZZ), Wilson disease and tyrosinaemia has been demonstrated and indications defined. An early mortality in excess of 15% and finite resources limit its use. Phenotypic heterogeneity make the precise indication in other disorders less certain. In disorders in which endstage liver disease is less frequent such as cystic fibrosis, haemochromatosis and galacosaemia it has been a very effective therapy. It has been used with encouraging results in disorders in which the liver is structurally normal such as Crigler-Najjar type I, primary hyperoxaluria type I and primary hypercholesterolaemia. In these it should be performed before there is permanent damage to brain, kidneys or heart. OLT in the short term prevents hyperammonaemic coma in urea cycle defects and may prevent extrahepatic disease in glycogen storage disease type IV. Its limitation in reversing all metabolic effects in these and other disorders is discussed. It is ineffective in protoporphyria or Niemann Pick disease type II (Sea Blue Histiocyte syndrome) in which the transplanted liver acquires the lesions of the initial disorder and extrahepatic features progress. Early referral provides optimum circumstances to assess the benefits of OLT as compared with those of other forms of management and to achieve transplantation at the ideal time. The place of OLT in management will require constant review as metabolic disorders are better defined, new forms of therapy evolve and as techniques of liver transplantation and modes of immunosuppression improve.
20625962	Persistence with treatment in patients with Wilson disease.	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Wilson disease is genetically induced failure of copper metabolism. If untreated, it may lead to death within several years from the onset of symptoms. Use of medication should therefore continue over the whole span of the patient's life after the diagnosis. Clinical observations show that patients with Wilson disease frequently stop the treatment. The aim of our study was to assess how drug compliance (defined as persistence with drug use) translates into the total well-being of patients with Wilson disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients diagnosed with Wilson disease and observed in our outpatient clinics were asked to fill in the self-completed questionnaire. Questions were related to demographic data, characteristics of the disease, methods of treatment and persistence with treatment, subjective assessment of health status and treatment efficacy. The EQ-5D questionnaire with a visual analogue scale of well-being was also used. RESULTS: Responses were obtained from 120 subjects but only 104 questionnaires could be further processed. Our analysis did not reveal differences in persistence with d-penicillamine and zinc sulphate use or efficacy of prescribed medication. We found, however, that regardless of the medication used, persistence with treatment resulted in significantly better results of self-assessment (total improvement in 39.7% vs. 7.7% in the non-persistent group, p = 0.003; partial improvement in 53.8% vs. 30.8%, respectively, p = 0.045; and deterioration: none in the persistent group vs. 42.3% in the non-persistent group, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Lack of persistence with use of prescribed medication is rather frequent among patients with Wilson disease. Lack of compliance decreases chances for improvement and might be the cause of clinical deterioration.
22261259	[Diagnosis and care of Wilson disease with neurological revelation].	Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive disease that produces a copper accumulation in many organs, initially in the liver, progressing to liver cirrhosis, and in the brain, with different neurologic symptoms. Diagnosis is based on clinical, biochemical, and genetic tests. Different treatments based on chelating agents may help reduce the disease's spontaneous morbidity and mortality. We describe three patients who presented Wilson disease before 18 years of age, with initial neurologic symptoms between 1998 and 2010. After comparison with literature reports, their clinical symptoms, progression, and care allowed us to propose a treatment algorithm. Neurologic symptoms are present in 35% of the patients with Wilson disease such as dystonia, extrapyramidal syndrome, dysarthria, dysphagia, and psychiatric symptoms. The time to diagnosis remains too long and may account for the increased severity of the illness encountered and problems treating these patients. The first treatment choice must be triethylenetetramine, which causes fewer side effects of initial worsening of symptoms compared to D-penicillamine. Zinc therapy is the first treatment for asymptomatic patients or those on maintenance treatment. Finally, liver transplantation is a potential treatment even if the patient presents severe neurological disability because it may improve clinical symptoms. However, further research is warranted on this matter.
21549078	D-penicillamine elastosis perforans serpiginosa: description of two cases and review of the literature.	"Long term D-penicillamine (DPA) therapy to treat Wilson disease can induce elastosis perforans serpiginosa (EPS), a very rare degenerative skin disease characterized by a transepidermal elimination of elastic fiber aggregates. The iatrogenous disease depends on DPA capacity to chelate copper and cause its depletion. Lysyl-oxidase is a copper dependent enzyme crucial to the dermal elastic fiber cross-linking, which is strongly affected by DPA copper depletion. Direct binding of the drug to collagen precursors also affects elastic fiber assemblage and maturation. The abnormal elastin accumulates into the middle dermis and produces a characteristic bramble brush or ""lumpy-bumpy"" appearance. In this way it acts as a foreign body and is progressively extruded through the epidermis. Clinically, the disease presents with multiple firm keratotic papules and nodules arranged in annular plaques over the neck, axillae, antecubital fossae, and forearms. The rarity of the disease frequently causes misdiagnoses and the process continues unabated causing concerns about systemic elastopathy."
1298933	[Liver transplant in childhood: our experience].	From december 1984 to december of 1991, 12 children underwent on orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT): 6 had extrahepatic biliary atresia (EHBA), 2 had Byler disease, 2 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 1 Alagille Syndrome and 1 had a hyperacute Wilson disease. The children, transplanted for the most part a broad, return for observation 3 months after OLT. A patient with hyperacute Wilson's Disease had 2 emergency OLTs and died of sepsis (due to Aspergillus); another with EHBA, operated for hepatoportoenterostomy, without result, died after OLT because of a ruptured aortic aneurysm. The other 10 are living with a variable follow-up between 8 months and 7 years. The post-operatory complications were present in 4 cases: in the same patient (15 months old) a hepatic artery thrombosis and then a portal vein thrombosis were observed; 3 patients had to have their biliary-digestive anastomosis redone. 7 of 10 patients had acute rejection. During the first month after OLT infection episodes were mostly due to bacteria (G-), Candida and Pneumocystis carinii (blood and intraabdominal sepsis). In the second period (1-3 months) there were viral infections, in particular CMV. An emergency transplanted patient, incompletely vaccinated, developed HBV infection. During long term follow-up (after the 3rd months from OLT) the children usually have mild infections of the respiratory and urinary tracts. After 1 year, they have a mean annual growth velocity that is between the 50th and 90th percentile. They showed a good rehabilitation. Their hospitalizations rate was reduced if compared with the period before OLT. Health, motor function and general behavior improved significantly.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
24726229	Delayed appearance of wing-beating tremor after liver transplantation in a patient with Wilson disease.	Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is the sole etiological treatment for Wilson disease (WD), but several neurological complications after OLT have been reported. We report a WD patient who developed a unilateral wing-beating tremor 6years after OLT. New neurological symptoms develop immediately after OLT in most cases. In our patient, the onset of extrapyramidal symptoms was at a prolonged interval after OLT. To our knowledge this is the first patient with delayed extrapyramidal symptoms after OLT in WD where the pathophysiology of these late extrapyramidal symptoms is still unknown. 
38695602	Relapse following withdrawal of D-penicillamine from combination (D-penicillamine + zinc) therapy in hepatic Wilson disease.	OBJECTIVES: Long-term D-penicillamine (D-pen) therapy in Wilson disease (WD) has numerous adverse effects which advocates its withdrawal, but with an inherent risk of relapse. This prospective observational study was conducted with the objective of evaluating incidence of relapse following withdrawal of D-pen from combination (D-pen + zinc) therapy in maintenance phase of previously symptomatic hepatic WD. METHODS: Hepatic WD patients <18 years of age and on combination therapy for >2 years with 6 months of biochemical remission were included. Biochemical remission was defined as achievement of (i) aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) <=1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN), (ii) serum albumin >3.5 g/dL, international normalized ratio (INR) <1.5 and (iii) 24-h urinary copper excretion (UCE) <500 mcg/day, nonceruloplasmin-bound-copper (NCC) <15 mcg/dL. After D-pen withdrawal, monthly liver function test (LFT) and INR and 3 monthly UCE and NCC were done till 1 year or relapse (elevation of AST/ALT/both >2 times ULN or total bilirubin >2 mg/dL), whichever occurred earlier. RESULTS: Forty-five patients enrolled with median combination therapy duration of 36 months. Sixty percent of them had their index presentation as decompensated cirrhosis. Fourteen patients (31.8%) relapsed (cumulative incidence: 4 at 3 months, 11 at 6 months, and 14 at 12 months after D-pen discontinuation). All relapsers had index presentation as decompensated cirrhosis. On Cox-regression, ALT at D-pen withdrawal was an independent predictor of relapse (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.077, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.014-1.145, p = 0.017) with area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of 0.860. ALT >=40 U/L predicted risk of relapse with 85.7% sensitivity, 70.9% specificity. CONCLUSION: Incidence of relapse after withdrawal of D-pen from combination therapy is 31.8% in hepatic WD. ALT >=40 U/L, at the time of D-pen stoppage, predicts future relapse.
28433098	Wilson disease in children.	Wilson disease (WD) is an inherited disorder mainly of hepatocellular copper disposition, due to dysfunction of the Wilson ATPase, a P1B-ATPase encoded by the gene ATP7B. In children, as in older age brackets, clinical disease is highly diverse. Although hepatic disease is the common presentation in children/adolescents, neurologic, psychiatric, and hematologic clinical presentations do occur. Very young children may have clinically evident liver disease due to WD. Early diagnosis, preferably when the child/adolescent is asymptomatic, is most likely to result in near-normal longevity with generally good health so long as the patient tolerates effective medication, is adherent to the lifelong treatment regimen, and has consistent access to the medication. Apart from a lively index of clinical suspicion on the part of physicians, biochemical tests including liver tests, serum ceruloplasmin, and basal 24-hour urinary copper excretion and genotype determination are key to diagnosis. Oral chelation treatment remains central to medical management, although zinc appears to be an attractive option for the presymptomatic child. Pediatric patients presenting with Wilsonian fulminant hepatic failure must be differentiated from those with decompensated cirrhosis, since the latter may respond to intensive medical interventions and not require liver transplantation. Recently identified WD-mimic disorders reveal important aspects of WD pathogenesis.
11485753	Physiological and clinical implications of proANP(1-98) circulating levels in the perioperative phase of liver transplantation.	BACKGROUND: ProANP(1-126), the prohormone synthesized and secreted by atrial myocites, generates an ANP peptide family, the main forms of which are proANP(1-30), proANP(31-67), proANP(1-98) and proANP(99-126). These molecular circulating forms are involved in hemodynamic and electrolyte homeostasis. In cirrhotic patients, volume homeostasis is almost impaired due to abnormal sodium retention, which results in ascites formation and hemodynamic changes, including high cardiac output and low systemic vascular resistance. During liver transplantation, in the anhepatic phase, hemodynamic instability may occur because of decreased venous return due to surgical manipulation of inferior vena cava, considerable blood loss or cross-clamping. Moreover, marked hemodynamic instability is often observed at the reperfusion of the graft. AIMS: The aims of present study are to investigate the changes of ANP during the perioperative phases of Orthotopic Liver Transplantation (OLTx) in end-stage cirrhotic patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From July to September 1999, 11 cirrhotic patients undergoing to OLTx were included in the study: seven males and four females (average age 46+/-10.4 years) affected by post-alcoholic cirrhosis [Hypertension 15 (1990) 9], post-hepatitis cirrhosis [D.G. Gardner, M.C. Lapointe, B. Kovacic-Milivojevic, C.F. Deschepper, Molecular analisys and regulation of the atrial natriuretic factor gene, in: A.D. Struphers (Ed.), Frontiers in Farmacology and Therapeutics: Atrial Natriuretic Factor, Blackwell, Oxford, England, 1991, pp. 1-22], Wilson disease [Life Sci. 28 (1981) 89] and polycystic disease [Life Sci. 28 (1981) 89], autoimmune cirrhosis [Life Sci. 28 (1981) 89]. In each patient, a hemodynamic assessment was achieved using a Swan-Ganz catheter. Periferical venous samples were performed during and immediately after OLTx for the determination of ANP(1-98) and other biohumoral parameters. RESULTS: Mean ANP(1-98) (pmol/ml mean+/-SD) basal levels resulted higher than that recorded in the group of healthy subjects. A significant correlation between 24-h post-reperfusion ANP and intra-operative RBC and RIS requirement was found (p<0.05). The basal values resulted significantly higher than that observed at phase II degrees (p<0.04) and lower than that at phase VI degrees (p<0.05); the anesthetic induction values were significantly lower than that observed at phase VI degrees (p<0.03). CONCLUSIONS: ANP(1-98) values may represent a useful marker of hemodynamic derangements during and after OLTx. Further clinical correlations will need a larger patient basis.
9544415	Liver transplantation for neuropsychiatric Wilson disease.	Although neuropsychiatric manifestations are prominent in some patients with Wilson disease, there is little published information regarding the efficacy of liver transplantation for these patients. A 22-year-old male with advanced neurological impairment and prominent psychiatric manifestations due to Wilson disease who underwent liver transplantation is presented. After transplantation, the ceruloplasmin and copper studies normalized and eventually the Kayser-Fleischer rings disappeared. Neurological recovery was very slow and incomplete, and his behavioural and personality disorder was entirely unaffected. He committed suicide 43 months post-transplantation. A review of the small number of related published cases in the English language literature shows variable neurological recovery post-transplantation, but the course of psychiatric manifestations is virtually never described. This case suggests that one must be cautious regarding liver transplantation for Wilson disease in patients with prior psychiatric manifestations. Aggressive medical management is likely to be preferable in most cases.
9265898	Molecular biological methods in diagnosis and treatment of liver diseases.	Molecular biology is making a tremendous impact on the diagnosis and treatment of liver diseases. Methods such as the polymerase chain reaction are changing the way physicians diagnose and monitor patients with viral hepatitis. Assays based on recombinant protein antigens allow for detection of specific autoantibodies in diseases such as primary biliary cirrhosis. The diagnosis of inherited metabolic diseases, such as hemochromatosis and Wilson disease, is being revolutionized by discovery of the defective genes involved and the development of methods to rapidly sequence DNA and identify mutations. Treatments and preventive measures are now possible with use of drugs and vaccines produced by recombinant DNA technology. Gene therapy and nucleic acid-based therapeutics are also realistic future treatment options for individuals with liver diseases.
28260463	Auxiliary Partial Orthotopic Living Liver Transplant for Wilson Disease.	Wilson disease is a genetic disease involving copper metabolism disturbances that result in copper accumulations, especially in the liver and brain. Wilson disease can be treated with pharmacologic agents, such as chelators that induce urinary excretion of copper or zinc salts that inhibit copper absorption in the digestive tract. Liver transplant is the only treatment option for Wilson disease when liver failure has occurred. In some patients, that is, in those with Child-Pugh A score, neurologic disease can be seen without hepatic failure. Our recommendation is for these patients to have auxiliary partial orthotopic liver transplant. Here, we present a 36-year-old male patient with neurologic disease associated with Wilson disease who had successful related living-donor auxiliary partial orthotopic liver transplant using a left lobe. The patient, as a result of neurologic symptoms that included tremor walking and speaking problems and low serum ceruloplasmin level of 7 mg/dL, was diagnosed with Wilson disease, and a liver biopsy was performed. Chronic necroinflammatory disease activity was 4/18, and the patient received chelation treatment. His hepatic functions were normal. The donor was the patient's 57-year-old father whose liver function tests were also normal. The graft-to-recipient weight ratio was 1% using a left lobe graft. After transplant, serum ceruloplasmin levels on day 15 and month 1 were 14 and 19 mg/dL. At month 1, liver function tests were normal. Doppler ultrasonography showed normal vascular flow of the native liver and the graft. The patient's neurologic symptoms were progressively reduced. Progressive neurologic deterioration with no hepatic insufficiency is considered a suitable indication for auxiliary partial orthotopic liver transplant; this procedure is suggested before the neurologic and liver failure symptoms of Wilson disease occur.
26093745	Influence of Liver Transplantation on Neuropsychiatric Manifestations of Wilson Disease.	OBJECTIVES: This study sought to evaluate the effect of liver transplantation on the neuropsychological manifestations of Wilson disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nine of 42 Wilson disease patients had neuropsychological symptoms before liver transplantation. They were 7 male and 2 female subjects with a median age of 19 years (range 10 to 25). They were analyzed for their preoperative and postoperative hepatic, neurological, and psychological scores described by the Unified Wilson Disease Rating Scale after a mean 36.6 months of follow-up. RESULTS: Preoperative mean Model for End-Stage Liver Disease and Child-Pugh scores were 18.3 (range 15 to 26) and 8.9 (range 6 to 12), respectively. One patient had acute postoperative ischemic stroke unrelated to Wilson disease and was excluded from the statistical analysis. Preoperative and postoperative hepatic, neurological, and psychological scores of the remaining 8 patients were 7.4 +- 2.3 vs 2.4 +- 1.3 (P = .0005), 17.7 +- 11.7 vs 12.7 +- 12.5 (P = .055), and 9.0 +- 1.7 vs 7.0 +- 2.1 (P = .033). CONCLUSIONS: Liver transplantation for Wilson disease can provide some improvement of the neuropsychological symptoms in addition to the hepatic recovery.
30384011	Chelating principles in Menkes and Wilson diseases: Choosing the right compounds in the right combinations at the right time.	Dysregulation of copper homeostasis in humans is primarily found in two genetic diseases of copper transport, Menkes and Wilson diseases, which show symptoms of copper deficiency or overload, respectively. However, both diseases are copper storage disorders despite completely opposite clinical pictures. Clinically, Menkes disease is characterized by copper deficiency secondary to poor loading of copper-requiring enzymes although sufficient body copper. Copper accumulates in non-hepatic tissues, but is deficient in blood, liver, and brain. In contrast, Wilson disease is characterized by symptoms of copper toxicity secondary to accumulation of copper in several organs most notably brain and liver, and a saturated blood copper pool. It is a challenge to correct copper dyshomeostasis in either disease though copper depletion in Menkes disease is most challenging. Both diseases are caused by defective copper export from distinct cells, and we seek to give new angles and guidelines to improve treatment of these two complementary diseases. Therapy of Menkes disease with copper-histidine, thiocarbamate, nitrilotriacetate or lipoic acid is discussed. In Wilson disease combination of a hydrophilic chelator e.g. trientine or dimercaptosuccinate with a brain shuttle e.g. thiomolybdate or lipoate, is discussed. New chelating principles for copper removal or delivery are outlined.
35042319	Wilson disease in children and young adults - State of the art.	Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations of the ATP7B gene, with a reported prevalence of 1:30,000-50,000. ATP7B encodes an enzyme called transmembrane copper-transporting ATPase, which is essential for copper incorporation into ceruloplasmin and for copper excretion into the bile. A lack or dysfunction of this enzyme results in a progressive accumulation of copper in several organs, especially in the liver, the nervous system, corneas, kidneys, and heart. Children with WD can present with asymptomatic liver disease, cirrhosis, or acute liver failure, with or without neurological and psychiatric symptoms. Approximately 20%-30% of WD patients present with ALF, while most of the other patients have chronic progressive hepatitis or cirrhosis if untreated. Although genetic testing has become a more important diagnostic tool for WD, the diagnosis remains based on both clinical features and laboratory investigations. The aims of treatment are to reduce copper levels and prevent its accumulation in the liver and other organs, especially in the central nervous system. Liver transplantation in WD is a life-saving option for patients presenting with liver failure and encephalopathy. For WD patients treated with chelating agents, adherence to the therapy is essential for long-term success. In this review, we also address specific issues in young adults as compared to children.
22447258	Sleep disorders in chronic liver disease.	Sleep-related complaints and disturbances are increasingly recognized in the setting of chronic liver disease and have recently been shown to be an important prognostic factor in patients with advanced chronic liver disease. This article reviews the literature surrounding sleep disturbances and disorders in a variety of types of chronic liver disease. This includes the association of sleep disturbances with hepatitis C and antiviral therapy, primary biliary cirrhosis, and Wilson disease as well as the circadian rhythm abnormalities present in cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy. The association between chronic liver disease, particularly nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and sleep-disordered breathing is also reviewed in detail.
23986430	Effect of liver transplantation on brain magnetic resonance imaging pathology in Wilson disease: a case report.	The authors present a case report of a 28-year-old patient with hepatic, but no neurological, signs of Wilson disease, with pathological changes in both the globi pallidi and caudate found with routine brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The patient was recommended for liver transplantation by hepatologists, and during the two years of observation after liver transplantation, MRI brain abnormalities due to Wilson disease completely regressed. On the basis of this case, the authors present an argument for the prognostic significance of brain MRI in Wilson disease as well as current recommendations concerning liver transplantation in Wilson disease.
17584039	Perspectives for gene therapy of Wilson disease.	Wilson disease is a rare autosomal-recessive copper overload disorder due to mutations of the Wilson disease gene ATP7B. The disease typically manifests at late childhood or in young adults with hepatic and/or neurological symptoms. Being fatal without medical treatment or liver transplantation the long-term outcome of Wilson disease depends on the adherence to an effective treatment. Because current medical treatment options are not effective in all Wilson disease patients and adherence to therapy is a problem, gene therapy might represent an alternative curative future therapy. In the rat model of Wilson disease adenoviral and lentiviral gene transfer studies could prove that viral gene transfer is therapeutically effective and can reverse clinical symptoms. However, both approaches were limited by a more or less transient transgene expression. As several tactics can be used to overcome these current limitations, gene therapy approaches may become more efficient than standard medical treatment for Wilson disease in the future. This review discusses both, existing vectors and strategies and prospective developments towards liver-directed gene therapy, although there is still a long way to go until gene therapy can be used for safe treatment of Wilson disease in humans.
17765927	Withdrawal of penicillamine from zinc sulphate-penicillamine maintenance therapy in Wilson's disease: promising, safe and cheap.	BACKGROUND: Penicillamine, once considered the cornerstone of treatment for Wilson disease (WD), is rather expensive and toxic, and often causes neurological worsening. Zinc sulphate, aiming at the treatment of free-copper toxicosis, has emerged as effective, safe and cheap alternative. AIM: To assess the effect of withdrawal of penicillamine from maintenance treatment with penicillamine and zinc sulphate. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 45 patients of WD (M:F: 28:17; age at diagnosis: 13.5+/-63 years), on both penicillamine (P) and zinc sulphate (Zn), couldn't continue penicillamine due to financial constraints. Their clinical data, disability and impairment scores (Schwab and England (S&E) score, Neurological Symptom Score (NSS), and Chu staging) and follow-up data of patients maintained only on zinc sulphate were recorded. RESULTS: Majority of patients (84.4%) had neuropsychiatric manifestations. The mean duration of treatment with penicillamine (P) and zinc sulphate (P+Zn), before stopping penicillamine, was 107.4+/-67.3 months. 40 patients improved variably, while the rest didn't. They received only zinc sulphate for 27.2+/-8.5 months (range: 12 to 34) and 44 patients (97.7%) remained status quo or improved marginally. Only one patient reported worsening in dysarthria. Their disability and impairment scores during combination (penicillamine and zinc sulphate) and Zn alone were: Chu (1.3+/-0.5 vs. 1.5+/-1.9; p=0.4), NSS (1.8+/-3.1 vs. 1.5+/-2.3; p=0.03) and S&E (96.4+/-5.6 vs. 98.6+/-3.5; p=0.03). There were no adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: Withdrawal of penicillamine from zinc sulphate/penicillamine maintenance therapy for patients with Wilson's disease was effective, safe and economic, for almost all patients. This retrospective study reiterates that zinc sulphate may be used as a preferred mode of treatment for patients with Wilson's disease.
1499587	Plasma exchange for fulminant Wilson disease.	
37996345	Efficacy of therapeutic plasma exchange in pediatric cases of acute liver failure as an extracorporeal liver support system.	BACKGROUND: Acute liver failure in the pediatric population is often accompanied by deranged metabolism, severe encephalopathy and coagulopathy. A liver transplant is the most viable option for the management of such patients. Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) is helpful in improving the liver biochemistry profile, thereby, increasing their likelihood of undergoing a liver transplant METHOD: The study was conducted over a period of 3 years (January 2018 to December 2021). Indications mainly consisted of ALF with hepatic encephalopathy, worsening liver parameters in spite of medical management, and candidacy for undergoing a liver transplant. Plasma exchange was performed daily or alternatively until the patient recovered, succumbed, or was stable enough to undergo a transplant. Biochemical parameters serum bilirubin, ALT, AST serum ammonia serum urea, serum creatinine were recorded before and after TPE sessions. RESULTS: The study group comprised 14 patients of which a total of 28 TPE was performed. There were a total of 5 cases of cryptogenic ALF, 4 of Wilson disease, 2 cases each of infection-related ALF and autoimmune hepatitis, and a single case of drug-induced hepatitis. A total of 5 out of 14 patients underwent a liver transplant and amongst the 9 who did not undergo a transplant, 4 patients expired due to septic shock syndrome; the remaining 5 were discharged in a stable condition following TPE sessions. The disease-free survival was 78.9% and the transplant-free survival was 35.71%. CONCLUSION: TPE plays a crucial role in improving the biochemistry profile of the liver in children with liver failure.
18825711	Use of the molecular adsorbents recirculating system as a treatment for acute decompensated Wilson disease.	Acute decompensated Wilson disease presenting as fulminant liver failure is a life-threatening condition for which liver transplantation is the ultimate treatment. It is listed as a status 1 indication according to the United Network for Organ Sharing classification. A massive amount of copper released during the attack induces hemolytic anemia and acute renal failure. Conventional chelating therapy attempting to remove copper from the patient is not satisfactory because there is inadequate time for these drugs to take action and patients are usually oliguric. The Molecular Adsorbents Recirculating System (MARS) is a form of modified dialysis that removes putative albumin-bound toxins associated with liver failure. It is believed that extracorporeal albumin dialysate absorbs the circulating copper molecules that are trapped in the patient's circulation. We report 2 patients with acute decompensated Wilson disease treated with MARS. In the first case, the patient was started on MARS once conventional treatment failed. A significant amount of copper was removed from her circulatory system, and her condition stabilized afterwards. The treatment gained her extra time, and she was eventually bridged to liver transplantation. In the second case, the patient was started on MARS treatment early in the course of his illness, and his condition soon stabilized after the treatment. He was able to return to his home country for liver transplantation. In both cases, MARS was used as a means of preventing deterioration rather than salvaging devastation. In conclusion, MARS may confer benefits to patients with acute decompensated Wilson disease if it is started early in the course of illness.
17461475	Diagnostic criteria for acute liver failure due to Wilson disease.	AIM: To describe the diagnostic criteria for acute liver failure due to Wilson disease (WD), which is an uncommon cause of acute liver failure (ALF). METHODS: We compared findings of patients presenting with ALF due to WD to those with ALF of other etiologies. RESULTS: Previously described criteria, such as low alkaline phosphatase activity, ratio of low alkaline phosphatase to total bilirubin or ratio of high aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to alanine aminotransferase (ALT), failed to identify patients with ALF due to WD. There were significant differences in low ALT and AST activities (53 +/- 43 vs 1982 +/- 938, P < 0.0001 and 87 +/- 44 vs 2756 +/- 2941, P = 0.037, respectively), low choline esterase activity (1.79 +/- 1.2 vs 4.30 +/- 1.2, P = 0.009), high urine copper concentrations (93.4 +/- 144.0 vs 3.5 +/- 1.8, P = 0.001) and low hemoglobin (7.0 +/- 2.2 vs 12.6 +/- 1.8, P < 0.0001) in patients with ALF caused by WD as compared with other etiologies. Interestingly, 4 of 7 patients with ALF due to WD survived without liver transplantation. CONCLUSION: In ALF, these criteria can help establish a diagnosis of WD. Where applicable, slit-lamp examination for presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings and liver biopsy for determination of hepatic copper concentration still remain important for the diagnosis of ALF due to WD. The need for liver transplantation should be evaluated carefully as the prognosis is not necessarily fatal.
22720274	Wilson disease: Canadian perspectives on presentation and outcomes from an adult ambulatory setting.	BACKGROUND: Wilson disease (WD) is a rare disorder of copper metabolism. OBJECTIVE: To describe the authors' clinical experience with a cohort of 48 adult patients followed in an ambulatory setting. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of patients with a diagnosis of WD was performed. RESULTS: Fifty-nine charts were identified and 11 were excluded on further review. At diagnosis, 14 patients were asymptomatic, with 13 hepatic, 15 neurological and six mixed hepatic/neurological presentations. Ceruloplasmin levels were low (<0.20 g/L) in 94%, and 24 h urinary copper levels high (>0.60 micromol/L) in 95% of cases. D-penicillamine was the most common initial therapy (48%), with zinc the most common at review (65%). Overall, biopsy and ultrasound reports documented cirrhosis in 53%. Portal hypertension, defined as splenomegaly (>12.0 cm), reversed portal venous flow on ultrasound or varices/gastropathy on endoscopy was seen in 63%. At last review, 39% had elevated aspartate aminotransferase (>34 U/L) and/or alanine aminotransferase levels (>40 U/L). One death and one transplant occurred, while three patients had encephalopathy, two became jaundiced, two developed ascites and one experienced variceal bleed. Of 21 neurological presenting patients, 14 improved compared with baseline, with four making almost complete recovery. Eleven patients experienced documented episodes of neurological decline, including four with non-neurological presentation. Diagnostic magnetic resonance imaging showed basal ganglia (64%), brainstem (64%) abnormalities and atrophy (36%); follow-up showed basal ganglia lesions (50%) and atrophy (55%). CONCLUSION: WD is a diverse chronic disease with generally favourable outcomes for patients who respond to initial therapy, which can be managed predominantly in an ambulatory setting.
33541020	[Research progress in gene therapy for Wilson's disease].	Wilson's disease (WD) is a kind of inherited single-gene autosomal recessive disorder in which mutations in the ATP7B gene cause copper excretion disorders. Drug therapy is currently the main treatment method for WD. Liver transplantation should be considered for poor drug response or acute liver failure. However, it faces problems such as medication adherence, adverse reactions and shortage of liver source. Gene therapy in WD may permanently correct abnormal copper metabolism, which is why it is the focus of current research. This article summarizes the research progress of WD around gene therapy vectors and CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system.
31152642	Remission of Late-Onset Post-Liver Transplantation Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma.	We describe the clinical course of a patient who developed high-grade lymphoma during immunosuppression treatment with cyclosporine A, following liver transplantation. After anti-neoplastic polychemotherapy treatment, the remission of lymphoma was confirmed and maintained for over four years. The patient, a 27 year old female had liver transplantation at the age of 17, due to acute liver failure, caused by non-diagnosed Wilson disease. Nearly seven years post-transplantation, the patient was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma (NHBCL), potentially induced by Cephalosporin A therapy. After the treatment with rituximab and CHOP therapy (r-CHOP protocol), remission was determined using computer tomography. Remission is maintained to date. A review of reported cases of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLDs) in liver transplanted (LT) patients showed that the onset of PTLDs is the highest in the first year after transplantation. In addition, remission rates of NHBCL in LT patients are not much elaborated in the literature. It is our opinion that the presented case is rare, both from the aspect of timeline of occurrence of the PTLD and the achieved remission, using r-CHOP protocol.
23243681	Fulminant Wilson disease.	
15810701	[Orthotopic liver transplantation in adult patients with cadaveric grafts. Experience of the Fundeni Center of General Surgery and Liver Transplantation].	"We analyze the experience of the Center of General Surgery and Liver Transplantation from the Fundeni Clinical Institute (Bucharest, Romania) regarding orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) in adult recipients, with whole liver grafts from cadaveric donors, between April 2000 (when the first successful LT was performed in Romania) and December 2004. This series includes 37 OLTs in adult recipients (16 women and 21 men, aged between 29-57 years--average 46 years). Other two LT with whole liver cadaveric grafts and two reduced-size LT were performed in children; also, in the same period, due to the acute organ shortage, other methods of LT were performed in 28 patients (21 living donor LT, 6 split LT and one ""do mino"" LT), that were not included in the present series. The indications for OLT were HBV cirrhosis--10, HBV+HDV cirrhosis--4, HCV cirrhosis--11, HBV+HCV cirrhosis--2, biliary cirrhosis--5, Wilson disease--2, alcoholic cirrhosis--1, non-alcoholic liver disease--1, autoimmune cirrhosis--1. With three exceptions, in which the classical transplantation technique was used, the liver was grafted following the technique described by Belghiti. Local postoperative complications occurred in 15 patients (41%) and general complications in 17 (46%); late complications were registered in 18 patients (49%) and recurrence of the initial disease in 6 patients (16%). Intrao- and postoperative mortality was 8% (3/37). There were two patients (5%) who died because of immunosuppressive drug neurotoxicity at more than 30 days following LT. Four patients (11%) died lately because of PTLD, liver venoocclusive disease, recurrent autoimmune hepatitis and liver venoocclusive disease, myocardial infarction, respectively. Thirty-four patients survived the postoperative period (92%); according to Kaplan-Meier analysis, actuarial patient-survival rate at month 31 was 75%."
15326235	Clinical correlation of brain MRI and MRS abnormalities in patients with Wilson disease.	BACKGROUND: The progression of Wilson disease (WD), a disorder of copper metabolism, can be arrested by chelation therapy. However, neurologic deficits may persist despite adequate treatment. MRI is used to assess patients with WD, but previous attempts to correlate clinical progression with the investigation findings have often been unsuccessful. OBJECTIVE: To identify MR visible markers that could help stratify disease severity and to clarify the mechanism of persistent neurologic deficit after treatment. METHODS: MRI and proton MR spectroscopy (1H-MRS) were performed in 17 patients with WD. MRI was assessed semiquantitatively and used to locate volumes of interest (voxels) in the striatum for 1H-MRS. RESULTS: MRI showed abnormalities predominantly confined to those patients with neurologic features of WD. The 1H spectra demonstrated a reduction of N-acetylaspartate and N-acetylaspartylglutamate (2.05 mM; p < 0.01) in those patients with neurologic features but not in patients without clinical neurologic involvement (0.42 mM; p > 0.1) in comparison with age-matched normal control subjects. Choline was also reduced in both patient groups (0.08 mM; p < 0.01) compared with age-matched controls. CONCLUSIONS: There may be a biochemical correlate of tissue-specific dysfunction in patients with Wilson disease who develop neurologic features. These changes appear to be present despite prior clinical improvement and may imply a need for additional treatment.
19765460	Split liver transplantation in Shiraz Transplant Center.	BACKGROUND: Cadaveric organ splitting emerged from an improved understanding of the surgical anatomy of the liver as a possible mechanism to expand the organ pool. In this study, we have reported our first series of split liver transplantations (SLT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: From June 2006 to June 2008, we performed 17 pairs of SLT: 70.6% ex situ and 29.4% in situ. The mean age of the donors (32 males, 2 females) was 23.15 +/- 9 years. All of them had been stable at the time of harvest according to vital signs, liver function tests, electrolytes, and urine output. The decision on splitting was made by the surgical team according to the donor's status and the urgency of the recipient. RESULTS: The main indications were biliary atresia (17.6%) followed by Wilson disease (14.7%) and cryptogenic cirrhosis (14.7%). The left lateral segment and the left lobe were used in 6 and 11 cases, respectively. In-hospital mortalities for the pediatric and adult groups were 68.4% and 26.7%, respectively. Primary graft nonfunction (52.9%), vascular complications (29.4%), sepsis (11.8%), and biliary complications (5.9%) were the main causes of mortality. CONCLUSION: Our experience indicated that SLT showed a high rate of mortality and morbidity.
29806946	WTX101 - an investigational drug for the treatment of Wilson disease.	INTRODUCTION: Wilson disease (WD) is a genetic disorder in which excess toxic copper accumulates in the liver, brain, and other tissues leading to severe and life-threatening symptoms. Copper overload can be assessed as non-ceruloplasmin-bound copper non-ceruloplasmin-bound copper (NCC) in blood. Current therapies are limited by efficacy, safety concerns, and multiple-daily dosing. Areas covered: This article reviews the literature on WTX101 (bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate), an oral first-in-class copper-protein-binding agent in development for the treatment of WD. Expert opinion: In a proof-of-concept phase II trial, once-daily WTX101 over 24 weeks rapidly lowered NCC levels and this was accompanied by improved neurological status without apparent initial drug-induced paradoxical worsening, reduced disability, stable liver function, with a favorable safety profile. WTX101 directly removes excess copper from intracellular hepatic copper stores and also forms an inert tripartite complex with copper and albumin in the circulation and promotes biliary copper excretion. These mechanisms may explain the rapid biochemical and clinical improvements observed. A phase III trial of WTX101 is ongoing and results are eagerly awaited to confirm if WTX101 can improve the treatment of this devastating disease.
23396027	Wilson disease in 71 patients followed for over two decades in a tertiary center in Saudi Arabia: a retrospective review.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Wilson disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive disease. Our objective was to describe the diverse patterns, therapies, and outcomes of this disease. DESIGN AND SETTING: A retrospective study over two decades on WD patients in a tertiary care center in Saudi Arabia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical and laboratory findings of 71 patients with WD were retrieved from their charts, referral notes and our hospital electronic records and were analyzed. RESULTS: The mean age and standard deviation was 16.8 (10.7) years and 56.5% were males. The main manifestations of WD were hepatic, neurological, and mixed in 39 (54.9%), 12 (16.9%), and 20 (28.2%) patients, respectively, and 11 (15.5%) were asymptomatic cases detected by family screening. A family history of WD was positive in 41 (57.7%) patients, and consanguinity of parents was found in 26 (36.6%) patients. The mean (SD) follow-up period was 92.2 (72.9) (range, 1-320) months. Ten (14.1%) patients died during follow up, while 45 (63.4%) and 16 (22.5%) were still on or lost from follow-up, respectively. The mean (SD) age at the end of follow-up was 25.3 (12) (range, 4-62) years. Hepatoma was discovered in 5 (7.0%) patients. Penicillamine therapy was used by 58 (81.7%) patients, while zinc and trientine were given to 32 (45.1%) and 11 (15.5%) patients, respectively. Sixteen (22.5%) patients underwent liver transplantation and one died (1.4%) on the waiting list. The liver condition remained stable or improved in 35 (49.3%), and the neurological status showed improvement in 11 (34.4%) of the 32 patients who had neurological involvement. CONCLUSIONS: This is the biggest cohort to be reported from the Middle East. WD presentation and outcome of WD are very diverse, and its diagnosis still depends on clinical, laboratory, and radiological evidence of abnormal copper metabolism. WD should be considered in patients of any age with obscure hepatic and/or neurological abnormalities.
19338486	Effect of D-penicillamine on liver fibrosis and inflammation in Wilson disease.	BACKGROUND: Wilson disease is a disorder of copper metabolism characterized by copper overload. A mutation in the ATP7B gene causes dysfunction of ATP7B protein and a reduction in copper excretion into the bile in hepatocytes. Excess copper accumulation leads to liver injury. D-penicillamine primarily can inhibit fibrogenesis and prevent the appearance of scar lesions in the liver. We studied this phenomenon in our patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pathology slides from the explanted livers of 26 patients diagnosed as having Wilson disease with hepatoneurologic manifestations between 2000 and 2008 who had undergone a liver transplant were investigated retrospectively. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to their history of D-penicillamine use before transplant. The degree of fibrosis and inflammation were classified as mild (1), moderate (2), and severe (3), and were reviewed by an impartial hepatopathologist. RESULTS: Of 26 patients (20 male, 6 female) who had Wilson disease with a mean age of 17.6 -/+ 8.6 years, 69% (18/26) had a history of D-penicillamine use before liver transplant from 6 months to 9 years (mean, 3.4 -/+ 2.7 years). In the D-penicillamine group, 14 patients (77%) had grade 1 fibrosis. Grade 2 and 3 fibrosis was seen in 5.6% and 16% of patients, respectively. In the D-penicillamine group, inflammation was grade 3 in 44% (8/18), grade 2 in 44% (8/18), and grade 1 in 11% of the patients (2/18). In the non- D-penicillamine group (8 patients), grades of fibrosis were grade 3 (62%), grade 2 (25%), and grade 1 (12%); 87% of the patients had grade 2 and 3 inflammation. The degree of fibrosis was significantly lower in the D-penicillamine group than it was in the non-D-penicillamine group (P < .05). CONCLUSION: D-penicillamine may reduce the rate of liver fibrogenesis in patients with Wilson disease.
8636833	Successful medical treatment of severely decompensated Wilson disease.	Delayed response to medical treatment sometimes leads to unnecessary liver transplantation in patients with severely decompensated Wilson disease. We report the course of five patients (mean age 13.4 years, range 11 to 15 years) with severely decompensated Wilson disease who were successfully treated medically. Prothrombin time improved after a minimum of 1 month and returned to normal within 3 months to 1 year or more.

34357516	Comparison of the Pharmacokinetic Profiles of Trientine Tetrahydrochloride and Trientine Dihydrochloride in Healthy Subjects.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder of copper metabolism. Chelation of excessive copper is recommended but data on the pharmacokinetics of trientine are limited. The aim of this study was to compare the pharmacokinetics of a new trientine tetrahydrochloride formulation (TETA 4HCl) with those of an established trientine dihydrochloride (TETA 2HCl) salt. METHODS: A randomised single-centre crossover study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of two different oral formulations of trientine (TETA 4HCl tablets vs TETA 2HCl capsules) in 23 healthy adult subjects receiving a single dose equivalent to 600 mg of trientine base was performed. RESULTS: Following oral administration, the median time to reach maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) was 2.00 h (TETA 4HCl) and 3.00 h (TETA 2HCl). The rate (maximum plasma concentration [Cmax]) and extent (area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity [AUC0- ]) of absorption of the active moiety, trientine, were greater (by approximately 68% and 56%, respectively) for TETA 4HCl than for the TETA 2HCl formulation. The two formulations presented a similar terminal elimination rate (lambdaz) and a similar terminal half-life (t1/2) for trientine. Differences between TETA 4HCl and TETA 2HCl in the levels of the two main mono- and diacetylated metabolites were less than seen for trientine. For both tested formulations, healthy male volunteers demonstrated higher trientine plasma levels but lower mono- and diacetylated metabolite levels compared with females, with no sex differences in terminal half-life (t1/2) observed. Single oral doses of both formulations were safe and well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with an identical dose of a TETA 2HCl formulation, the TETA 4HCl formulation provided more rapid absorption of trientine and greater systemic exposure in healthy subjects. Clinical Trials Number EudraCT # 2015-002199-25.
10604583	Albumin dialysis: effective removal of copper in a patient with fulminant Wilson disease and successful bridging to liver transplantation: a new possibility for the elimination of protein-bound toxins.	BACKGROUND: Acute liver failure may be the first manifestation of Wilson disease. If copper elimination fails, liver transplantation is the only remaining therapeutic option. Albumin dialysis, a new method for the removal of protein-bound toxins, was performed in a patient with fulminant Wilson disease. METHODS: An 18-year-old man with Wilson disease presented with hyperacute liver failure, hepatic encephalopathy III, oligo-anuric renal failure, haemolytic anaemia, rhabdomyolysis, pancreatitis and thrombocytopenia. He was treated with albumin dialysis using a 44 g/l albumin-containing dialysate and a slow dialysate flow rate (1-2 l/h). The other details of the technique used are similar to routine continuous veno-venous haemodiafiltration. RESULTS: One hundred and five milligrams of copper were removed by albumin dialysis within the first six treatments, resulting in normalisation of blood-copper levels. Successful treatment of the multiorgan failure was achieved. Hepatic encephalopathy improved within 2 days. The patient initially refused liver transplantation. Therefore 35 additional albumin dialysis treatments were performed. Forty-three grams of bilirubin (an indicator of detoxified substances in the liver) and 196 mg of copper were removed. Multiorgan failure, in particular hepatic encephalopathy, did not recur during 59 days of treatment. Eventually, the patient agreed to liver transplantation and that was successful. CONCLUSION: Albumin dialysis is a new method for the effective treatment of fulminant Wilson disease, resulting in the removal of protein-bound toxins copper and bilirubin. It may serve as a new treatment option in hyperacute liver failure of other origin, acting as an extracorporeal detoxifier.
29050651	[Movement disorders: An update].	Movement disorders (tremor, chorea, dystonia, tics, and myoclonus) are related to basal ganglia and/or interconnected brain areas dysfunction. Clinical examination is a key point in order to characterize the abnormal movement and identify associated signs that can guide etiological approach. Iatrogenic diseases will be systematically ruled out before conducting additional investigations (brain MRI, electrophysiological studies). Wilson disease, but also other treatable metabolic and/or genetic diseases, and auto-immune diseases will be systematically considered. Therapeutic management is symptomatic and based on specific oral drugs appropriate to each movement disorders. In some cases, radiosurgery and deep brain stimulation should be helpful, especially for tremor and generalized dystonia.
22395570	Metals and the liver.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Hereditary liver diseases resulting in copper and iron overload may cause significant morbidity and mortality if not diagnosed and treated early. The goal of this review is to highlight the key publications on genetics, diagnosis and management of hemochromatosis and Wilson disease over the past 18 months. RECENT FINDINGS: Several recent advancements have been made in the genetic diagnosis of hemochromatosis and Wilson disease. Uncommon HFE mutations resulting in phenotypic hemochromatosis among C282Y heterozygotes have been identified from HFE gene sequencing. A serum ferritin less than 1000 mug/l in C282Y homozygotes was found to be associated with milder symptoms of hemochromatosis. Deferasirox was shown to reduce iron overload in patients with hemochromatosis and may be an option for patients who cannot tolerate phlebotomy. There was found to be evidence of genotype and phenotype correlation in Wilson disease, which can be diagnosed by genetic sequencing. A modified diagnostic guideline has been developed for children with Wilson disease with mild liver disease that increases the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis. Also treatment with copper chelating agents has less hepatic treatment failures when compared with zinc monotherapy. SUMMARY: Advancements in diagnosis of hemochromatosis and Wilson disease may lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment with resulting decrease in morbidity and mortality.
25380954	Pregnancy in a patient with hepatic artery thrombosis after liver transplantation: a case report.	BACKGROUND: Hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT) increases the risk of complications and mortality after liver transplantation. The incidence for HAT is increased in patients with risk factors (vascular reconstructions, coagulation disorders and acute rejection episodes amongst others). Early retransplantation improves the prognosis for patients, but owing to lack of donors, surgical and interventional radiologic attempts to restore the patency of hepatic artery are made. The prognosis for the liver and the patient can also be improved by the development of collateral circulation. CASE REPORT: We describe a case of a 30-year-old woman with hepatic failure owing to Wilson disease. Liver transplantation with the use of vascular conduit made of donor's iliac arteries was complicated by an early HAT. Heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation was confirmed in the patient. Despite surgical and radiologic attempts to restore patency and despite treatment with fractioned heparin and aspirin, the hepatic artery remained occluded. Retransplantation was not considered, even though the patient was planning a pregnancy. After 1 year of observation of stable liver function, conversion from mycophenolate mofetil to azathioprine treatment, the patient was given consent for a high-risk pregnancy. DISCUSSION: The course of pregnancy was uneventful, with normal liver function parameters, without pathological bleedings. The patient was treated with doses of enoxaparin adjusted for the patient's weight. In the 34th week, owing to increasing concentration of bile acids, the pregnancy ended with a cesarean section. The newborn had 10-point APGAR score.

23996411	Plasma exchange for hemolytic crisis and acute liver failure in Wilson disease: authors' reply.	
12962167	Wilson disease.	Wilson disease is a rare disorder of copper metabolism that results in accumulation of copper in the liver and subsequently in other organs, mainly the central nervous system and the kidneys. Advances in the diagnosis and treatment of Wilson disease are discussed, with the emphasis that this is a disease of children, adolescents, and young adults. The myriad manifestations of Wilson disease make its diagnosis dependent on a high index of suspicion, and determination of its genetic background is helping to elucidate the genotype-phenotype correlation and the diversity of presentations. Treatment of Wilson disease has progressed from chelation therapy using D-penicillamine and trientine to the more recent use of zinc and finally to the establishment of liver transplantation as an urgent but excellent modality for fulminant presentation. The evolution of Wilson disease from a uniformly fatal disease to an eminently treatable disease during the past century is an example of the remarkable advances of modern medicine.
26589720	Trientine induced colitis during therapy for Wilson disease: a case report and review of the literature.	BACKGROUND: Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of human copper metabolism characterized by copper accumulation in the liver due to impaired excretion of copper into the bile. Brain accumulation of copper may cause neuropsychiatric symptoms. Trientine (triethylenetetramine dihydrochloride) is a copper-chelating agent used to treat patients with WD. Trientine has been considered an option for initial treatment and maintentance therapy of WD due to its safety profile. CASE PRESENTATION: A 40 year old female with a recent diagnosis of WD was started on treatment with trientine for her WD. Within one month she developed profound bloody diarrhea unresponsive to medical treatment. Trientine was discontinued and a colonoscopy with biopsy showed moderately active ileitis and moderate to severe pancolitis, consistent with a drug induced mucosal injury. The colitis improved immediately upon withdrawal of trientine, and recurred when medication was rechallenged because of worsened WD symptoms. After second compulsory discontinuation of trientine, she remained on zinc therapy for her WD and her colitis resolved by time. CONCLUSION: Drug induced colitis is a very rare side effect of trientine. Although trientine therapy is well tolerated and less side effects are reported with this medication than penicillamine, colitis can occur during trientine treatment. Zinc therapy may be an effective alternative for treatment of WD in patients experiencing side effects from chelation therapy.
35706098	Long-Term Urinary Copper Excretion and Exchangeable Copper in Children With Wilson Disease Under Chelation Therapy.	OBJECTIVES: Determining 24-hour urinary copper excretion (UCE) levels is useful for diagnosing Wilson's disease (WD) and for treatment monitoring. Exchangeable copper (ExC) is a novel potential marker, but its long-term changes have never been described in patients under chelation therapy. Our aim was to describe the long-term changes in ExC levels compared to UCE levels in symptomatic WD pediatric patients under chelation therapy. METHODS: A retrospective, descriptive, and analytical study including all patients under 18 years of age, diagnosed between 2006 and 2020, and treated with chelation therapy was conducted at the National Reference Center for WD in Lyon. Ceruloplasmin levels, serum copper, 24 h-UCE, ExC, and liver enzymes at diagnosis and during follow-up were analyzed. RESULTS: Our study included 36 patients, predominantly with hepatic form of WD (n = 31). The median [interquartile range (IQR)] age at diagnosis was 10.5 (8.4-13.1) years, and the median (IQR) follow-up duration was 6.3 (3.3-8.8) years. At diagnosis, the median (IQR) ExC value was 1.01 (0.60-1.52) micromol/L. There was a significant decrease during the first year of chelation treatment ( P = 0.0008), then a stabilization. The median (IQR) ExC values was 0.38 (0.22-0.63) micromol/L at 12-18 months and 0.43 (0.31-0.54) micromol/L at 5 years of chelation treatment ( P = 0.4057). Similarly, there was a significant decrease in 24-hour UCE ( P < 0.001) during the first year of chelation treatment, then a stabilization. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed a significant decrease in ExC and 24-hour UCE levels during the first year of follow-up; The dynamics of both biomarkers were similar along the follow-up, demonstrating their usefulness in clinical practice for monitoring WD.
11472373	Haemolytic onset of Wilson disease in a patient with homozygous truncation of ATP7B at Arg1319.	We describe a 19-year-old woman with haemolytic anaemia and thrombocytopenia as the initial manifestation of Wilson disease (WD). There are two reasons for reporting such an improbable case. First, it emphasizes the importance of recognizing atypical clinical presentations of potentially lethal recessive traits for which therapy is available. Second, it shows that, even in a monogenic disorder like WD, the phenotype cannot be extrapolated from the mutated genotype in a simple fashion; this patient had a relatively late-onset form of WD despite homozygosity for a genetic lesion leading to an apparent complete loss of function of the WD copper transporter.
32745371	Effect of chelation therapy in pediatric Wilson's disease: Liver and endoscopic outcome.	BACKGROUND: As there is paucity of exclusive literature on pediatric hepatic Wilson's disease (WD), this study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of chelation on hepatocellular function and portal hypertension in WD. METHODS: Wilson's disease patients with >=9 months of follow-up were evaluated for response to chelation therapy in the following categories: (a) complete remission, (b) partial remission (c) progression of disease; (d) drug toxicity. Pediatric end-stage liver disease (PELD), Nazar and New Wilson Index scores were compared. Hemodynamically stable patients underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (baseline and surveillance) and received prophylaxis (primary or secondary). Endoscopic outcome was assessed at follow-up. RESULTS: Of the 111 WD children (aged 9 [3-15] years; PELD score 16 [-11 to 60]), 65 with follow-up of 3.6 (0.8-12) years on chelation (83% D-penicillamine monotherapy, 17% D-penicillamine and zinc) were analyzed. 81% had severe disease at presentation. Favorable outcome (complete and or partial remission), progression of disease and drug toxicity were seen in 71%, 29% and 10.8%, respectively. Two-thirds had esophageal varices which did not show progression. Large esophageal varices (16%) were effectively downgraded in 3 (2-6) therapeutic endoscopic sessions. Nazar score and PELD score at baseline were independent predictors of outcome with favorable correlation with each other (r = .864, P < .001). PELD cutoff 9.45 (AUC: 71%, sensitivity: 87%, specificity: 50%; P = .009) and Nazar score cut off 3.5 (AUC: 68%, sensitivity: 83%, specificity: 50%; P = .02) were associated with poor prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: Despite severe liver disease, the majority of hepatic WD can be managed on D-penicillamine monotherapy. PELD score and Nazar score effectively determine the outcome.
