input_text: 'Outcome of pediatric living donor liver transplant: Experience from Pakistan;
  a resource limited setting. INTRODUCTION: Liver transplantation (LT) has emerged
  as a lifesaving modality for many liver diseases in children. Pediatric LT is an
  established treatment in the Western world but is relatively a new procedure in
  resource-limited countries like Pakistan. The study aims to highlight the outcomes
  and survival of pediatric recipients from the first pediatric liver transplant center
  in Pakistan. METHOD: A retrospective analysis of pediatric LT was done from 2012
  to 2019. The study was conducted in the Hepatobiliary and liver transplant department
  of Shifa International Hospital (SIH), Islamabad. A detailed analysis for indications
  for pediatric LT, survival, and complications was done. RESULTS: Forty-five patients
  under 18 years of age underwent Living donor liver transplant (LDLT) in SIH. Median
  age was 9 years and M:F of 2:1. Cryptogenic liver disease followed by Wilson disease
  were the two most common indications of LT. The majority of patients had chronic
  liver disease 34 (75%) while 11 (24%) had acute liver failure. The right lobe graft
  was the most common type of graft 19 (42.2%). Thirty days, 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year
  survival was 77.8%, 75.6%, 73.3%, and 60.6% respectively. Mortality was highest
  in patients with biliary atresia 4 (33%). Causes of death included pulmonary embolism,
  sepsis, surgical complications, and acute kidney injury. Mean survival was 88.850
  months (+-7.899) (CI 73.369-104.331). CONCLUSION: Pediatric LDLT has offered disease-free
  survival for patients. Survival can improve further with nutritional rehabilitation
  and anticipation and management of post-operative complications.'
