input_text: 'MRI and oxidative stress markers in neurological worsening of Wilson
  disease following penicillamine. BACKGROUND AND AIM: There is no report of MRI correlation
  with neurological worsening following chelating treatment in Wilson disease with
  neurological manifestation (WDN). We report radiological changes in four patients
  with WDN who worsen after penicillamine. METHODS: WDN was diagnosed on the basis
  of clinical, KF ring, serum ceruloplasmin and 24h urinary copper. Hematological,
  biochemical and cranial MRI were repeated at the time of clinical deterioration
  following chelating treatment. RESULTS: Four WDN patients had neurological deterioration
  within 4-8 weeks of penicillamine therapy. This was associated with new lesions
  in white matter, thalamus, pons and mid brain and these lesions showed diffusion
  restriction. The neurologic deterioration was associated with increased free serum
  copper and malanodialdehyde and reduced glutathione. Clinical conditions stabilized
  after few weeks of penicillamine discontinuation. CONCLUSION: Neurological worsening
  was associated with new lesions on MRI which revealed diffusion restriction. Increased
  free copper induced oxidative stress may be responsible for these changes.'
