input_text: A Study on Apoptosis and Anti-apoptotic Status in Wilson Disease. Wilson
  disease (WD) is characterized by hepatolenticular degeneration, but there is no
  report on apoptosis and anti-apoptotic markers in WD patients with neurological
  manifestation (WDN). The aim of this study was to evaluate active caspase-3 and
  X-linked inhibitors of apoptosis protein (XIAP) level in WDN and correlate these
  with disease severity and markers of death (tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha),
  interleukin (IL)-8, malondialdehyde (MDA), and Cu) and survival signals (glutathione).
  Fifty-four patients with WDN and 36 healthy matched controls were included. Their
  severity, Burke-Fahn-Marsden (BFM) scores, blood counts, hemoglobin, serum chemistry,
  ceruloplasmin, and free copper and 24-h urinary copper were measured. Cranial MRI
  findings were noted. Serum active caspase-3, XIAP, TNF-alpha, IL-8, and plasma glutathione
  and MDA were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), flow cytometry,
  and spectrophotometer respectively. In the patients with WDN, active caspase-3 (0.55
  +- 0.11 vs 0.38 +- 0.06 ng/ml), TNF-alpha (76.05 +- 29.01 vs 36.05 +- 21.01 pg/ml),
  IL-8 (590.19 +- 89.19 vs 193.43 +- 71.01 pg/ml), and MDA (4.92 +- 0.39 vs 3.43 +-
  0.21 nmol/ml) levels were increased whereas XIAP (84.66 +- 10.39 vs 95.76 +- 10.11
  ng/ml) and glutathione (GSH) (2.03 +- 0.29 vs 2.98 +- 0.27 mg/dl) levels were decreased
  compared to controls. Active caspase-3 was correlated with neurological severity
  (r = 0.48), BFM score (r = 0.37), ceruloplasmin (r = -0.39), hemoglobin (r = -0.34),
  and serum Cu (r = 0.39). XIAP levels were correlated with neurological severity
  (r = -0.40), BFM (r = -0.51), serum Cu (r = -0.42), and ceruloplasmin (r = 0.34).
  The XIAP level positively correlated with survival (GSH) and inversely with death
  signals (TNF-alpha, IL-8, MDA and free serum Cu) whereas active caspase-3 positively
  correlated with death (TNF-alpha, IL-8, serum Cu, MDA) and inversely with survival
  signal (GSH). Serum active caspase-3 level increased in WDN and positively correlated
  with the severity of disease, death signals (TNF, IL-8, MDA, and free Cu) and inversely
  with GSH and XIAP.
