input_text: 'Neurologic Manifestations of Chronic Liver Disease and Liver Cirrhosis.
  The normal functioning of brain is intimately as well as intricately interrelated
  with normal functioning of the liver. Liver plays a critical role of not only providing
  vital nutrients to the brain but also of detoxifying the splanchnic blood. Compromised
  liver function leads to insufficient detoxification thus allowing neurotoxins (such
  as ammonia, manganese, and other chemicals) to enter the cerebral circulation. In
  addition, portosystemic shunts, which are common accompaniments of advanced liver
  disease, facilitate free passage of neurotoxins into the cerebral circulation. The
  problem is compounded further by additional variables such as gastrointestinal tract
  bleeding, malnutrition, and concurrent renal failure, which are often associated
  with liver cirrhosis. Neurologic damage in chronic liver disease and liver cirrhosis
  seems to be multifactorial primarily attributable to the following: brain accumulation
  of ammonia, manganese, and lactate; altered permeability of the blood-brain barrier;
  recruitment of monocytes after microglial activation; and neuroinflammation, that
  is, direct effects of circulating systemic proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor
  necrosis factor, IL-1beta, and IL-6. Radiologist should be aware of the conundrum
  of neurologic complications that can be encountered in liver disease, which include
  hepatic encephalopathy, hepatocerebral degeneration, hepatic myelopathy, cirrhosis-related
  parkinsonism, cerebral infections, hemorrhage, and osmotic demyelination. In addition,
  neurologic complications can be exclusive to certain disorders, for example, Wilson
  disease, alcoholism (Wernicke encephalopathy, alcoholic cerebellar degeneration,
  Marchiafava-Bignami disease, etc). Radiologist should be aware of their varied clinical
  presentation and radiological appearances as the diagnosis is not always straightforward. '
