input_text: 'Is it necessary to re-evaluate diagnostic criteria for Wilson disease
  in children? BACKGROUND/AIMS: The differential diagnosis of Wilson Disease (WD)
  is challenging, especially in children, because liver copper levels may also increase
  in other chronic liver diseases with bile stasis. The aim of this study is to determine
  urine and liver copper cut-off values to differentiate WD from other chronic liver
  diseases (non-WD, NWD) in children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-six patients
  participated in the study, 35 with WD and 41 with NWD. The two groups were divided
  into two subgroups according to the presence of cholestasis. At the time of diagnosis,
  age, sex, biochemical test results, serum ceruloplasmin, baseline 24-h urinary copper
  levels, liver biopsy histological findings, liver copper levels, and Child-Pugh
  scores were obtained from medical records. Copper content in liver tissue and copper
  levels in urine were measured by atomic absorption spectrometry. Cut-off values
  for differentiation of WD from NWD were determined by receiver operating characteristic
  (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: A liver copper cut-off value of 98 microg/g indicated WD
  with 91% sensitivity and 65.4% specificity (area under the curve =0.838, 95% CI:
  0.749-0.927). A 24-h urinary copper cut-off value of 67.5 microg/24h indicated WD
  with 85% sensitivity and 71% specificity (area under the curve =0.843, 95% CI: 0.752-0.934).
  CONCLUSION: In this study of pediatric chronic liver disease patients, copper cut-off
  values for distinguishing WD differed substantially from those used for diagnosis.
  A larger scale study is warranted to re-evaluate liver copper and 24-h urinary copper
  cut-offs for children with suspected WD.'
