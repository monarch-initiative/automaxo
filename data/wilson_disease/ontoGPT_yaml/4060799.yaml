input_text: "[Oral zinc in Wilson disease--an alternative to D-penicillamine]. Recently
  Brewer et al. reported the possibility of an oral zinc therapy in Wilson's Disease.
  We treated a 19 years old patient with decompensated liver cirrhosis due to Wilson's
  disease with zinc-sulphate. D-Penicillamine had to be withdrawn since proteinuria
  occurred under treatment. After the discontinuation of D-Penicillamine an increase
  of serum copper almost up to normal range was observed; concomitantly urinary copper
  elimination decreased. Under oral zinc sulphate therapy (145 mg/day) a drop of serum
  copper level was achieved and liver function improved: serum albumin, gamma globulins
  and prothrombin time reached normal values. The patient did not complain any side
  effects during oral zinc sulphate therapy. Oral zinc therapy in Wilson's Disease
  may be regarded as an alternative to D-Penicillamine treatment when this drug has
  to be discontinued because of side effects."
