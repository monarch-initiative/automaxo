input_text: 'Lentiviral gene transfer ameliorates disease progression in Long-Evans
  cinnamon rats: an animal model for Wilson disease. OBJECTIVE: Wilson disease is
  a copper storage disorder caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene leading to liver
  cirrhosis. It has previously been shown that lentiviral vectors can govern an efficient
  delivery and stable expression of a transgene. The aim of this pilot study was to
  prove the principle of a lentiviral gene transfer in the Long-Evans cinnamon (LEC)
  rat, an animal model of Wilson disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: LEC rats were treated
  either by systemic application of lentiviral vectors or by intrasplenic transplantation
  of LEC-rat hepatocytes lentivirally transduced with ATP7B. The ATP7B gene expression
  was analyzed by RT-PCR and immunofluorescence analysis. The therapeutic effect was
  assessed by analysis of liver histology, serum ceruloplasmin oxidase activity, and
  liver copper content. RESULTS: Hepatic expression of the transgene was detected
  at different time-points post-treatment and lasted for up to 24 weeks (end of experiment).
  Liver copper levels were lowered in all treatment groups compared to untreated LEC
  rats. Twenty-four weeks after treatment, the area of the examined liver-tissue sections
  occupied by fibrosis was 48.3-57.9% in untreated LEC rats and 10.7-19.8% in rats
  treated with cell therapy. In systemically treated rats, only small fibrous septa
  could be observed. CONCLUSIONS: These data prove for the first time that lentiviral
  ATP7B gene transfer is feasible in Wilson disease. In our pilot study the systemic
  approach was more promising in ameliorating disease progression than the transplantation
  of lentivirally transduced hepatocytes.'
