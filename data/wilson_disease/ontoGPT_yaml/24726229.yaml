input_text: 'Delayed appearance of wing-beating tremor after liver transplantation
  in a patient with Wilson disease. Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is the
  sole etiological treatment for Wilson disease (WD), but several neurological complications
  after OLT have been reported. We report a WD patient who developed a unilateral
  wing-beating tremor 6years after OLT. New neurological symptoms develop immediately
  after OLT in most cases. In our patient, the onset of extrapyramidal symptoms was
  at a prolonged interval after OLT. To our knowledge this is the first patient with
  delayed extrapyramidal symptoms after OLT in WD where the pathophysiology of these
  late extrapyramidal symptoms is still unknown. '
