input_text: 'Potential feasibility of early bone marrow cell injection into the spleen
  for creating functional hepatocytes. BACKGROUND: Bone marrow cells (BMCs) are believed
  to have the ability to generate functional hepatocytes and have some merits as a
  therapeutic modality for metabolic liver diseases. However, the appearance of BMC-derived
  hepatocytes (BMDHs) is low. We hypothesized that early BMC injection would be feasible
  for creating BMDHs for two main reasons: (1) the liver is a hematopoietic organ
  in neonatal rats and (2) it may allow sufficient time to generate more BMDHs before
  severe liver injury occurs. METHODS: We used Long Evans Cinnamon (LEC) rats as recipients,
  a model of (1) Wilson disease and (2) liver carcinogenesis. Green fluorescent protein-expressing
  BMCs were injected into newborn LEC rats through the spleen. The oxidative activity
  of ceruloplasmin, which is low in LEC rats, was measured to evaluate the treatment.
  In addition, we performed fluorescence in situ hybridization to clarify the origin
  of the BMDHs and immunohistochemical analysis to confirm whether these BMDHs had
  malignant potential. RESULTS: At 18 months after injection, we found some green
  fluorescent protein-expressing areas macroscopically in the liver of treated LEC
  rats. The oxidative activity of ceruloplasmin increased in treated LEC rats (n=7)
  and were much higher than that in untreated LEC rats (P=0.015). Moreover, we confirmed
  that the BMDHs were generated by cell fusion and was not detected in any of the
  neoplastic lesions or cholngiofibrotic regions. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest
  that this novel strategy for creating BMDHs is effective and safe.'
