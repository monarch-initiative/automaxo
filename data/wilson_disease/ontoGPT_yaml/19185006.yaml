input_text: Bile salt-induced pro-oxidant liver damage promotes transplanted cell
  proliferation for correcting Wilson disease in the Long-Evans Cinnamon rat model.
  Insights into disease-specific mechanisms for liver repopulation are needed for
  cell therapy. To understand the efficacy of pro-oxidant hepatic perturbations in
  Wilson disease, we studied Long-Evans Cinnamon (LEC) rats with copper toxicosis
  under several conditions. Hepatocytes from healthy Long-Evans Agouti (LEA) rats
  were transplanted intrasplenically into the liver. A cure was defined as lowering
  of copper to below 250 microg/g liver, presence of ATPase, Cu++ transporting, beta
  polypeptide (atp7b) messenger RNA (mRNA) in the liver and improvement in liver histology.
  Treatment of animals with the hydrophobic bile salt, cholic acid, or liver radiation
  before cell transplantation produced cure rates of 14% and 33%, respectively; whereas
  liver radiation plus partial hepatectomy followed by cell transplantation proved
  more effective, with cure in 55%, P < 0.01; and liver radiation plus cholic acid
  followed by cell transplantation was most effective, with cure in 75%, P < 0.001.
  As a group, cell therapy cures in rats preconditioned with liver radiation plus
  cholic acid resulted in less hepatic copper, indicating greater extent of liver
  repopulation. We observed increased hepatic catalase and superoxide dismutase activities
  in LEC rats, suggesting chronic oxidative stress. After liver radiation or cholic
  acid, hepatic lipid peroxidation levels increased, indicating further oxidative
  injury, although we did not observe overt additional cytotoxicity. This contrasted
  with healthy animals in which liver radiation and cholic acid produced hepatic steatosis
  and loss of injured hepatocytes. We concluded that pro-oxidant perturbations were
  uniquely effective for cell therapy in Wilson disease because of the nature of preexisting
  hepatic damage.
