input_text: 'Liver Transplant Can Resolve Severe Neuropsychiatric Manifestations of
  Wilson Disease: A Case Report. Although liver transplant for decompensated cirrhosis
  secondary to Wilson disease is well accepted, the use of transplant for patients
  with severe neurologic manifestations of this condition remains controversial, and
  these can be perceived as a contraindication. Here, we describe a 45-year-old woman
  who presented with an incidental hepatocellular carcinoma at the time of transplant.
  The patient had severe neurologic manifestations of Wilson disease pretransplant,
  including dysarthria, hyperreflexia, asymmetrical ataxia, tremor, bradyphrenia,
  and shuffling gait. She underwent successful transplant from a hepatic and surgical
  standpoint, but her postoperative course was marked by protracted mutism, hypophonia,
  and fluctuating akinesia and immobility that did not respond promptly to withdrawal
  of calcineurin inhibitors or pramipexole but did respond robustly to amantadine.
  At 9 months posttransplant, there was marked neurologic improvement, and, at 18
  months, she exhibited subtle memory and organizational difficulties but was fully
  ambulatory and otherwise completely functional. Our experience suggests that even
  patients with severe neurologic Wilson disease may recover after transplant, albeit
  slowly, demonstrating the need for a multidisciplinary approach, including pre-
  and posttransplant neurologic and neuropsychiatric consultations.'
