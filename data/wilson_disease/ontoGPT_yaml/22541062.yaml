input_text: Other genetic liver diseases in children. Wilson disease is rare but proteiform,
  and should be suspected in any child with liver disease and older than 3 years of
  age. The treatment is very efficient, and must be taken life-long. Fifteen percent
  of patients with alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency develop a neonatal jaundice, and
  3% a cirrhosis in childhood. There is no specific treatment except liver transplantation.
  Five percent of cystic fibrosis patients develop a cirrhosis, with a very slow progression.
  Milder abnormalities are frequent, as well as biliary stones. Liver disease in ciliopathies
  may be a congenital hepatic fibrosis, with risks of portal hypertension and cholangitis,
  or a more variable biliary disease. Gilbert disease is frequent and benign. Crigler-Najjar
  syndrome is rare, severe, and may be an indication for liver or liver-cell transplantation.
