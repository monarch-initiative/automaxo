input_text: "Mortality Analysis of Acute Liver Failure in Uruguay. BACKGROUND: Acute
  liver failure (ALF) is a syndrome with high mortality. OBJECTIVE: Describe characteristics
  and outcomes of patients with ALF in Uruguay, and identify factors associated with
  mortality. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 33 patients with ALF was performed
  between 2009 and 2017. RESULTS: The patients' median age was 43 years, and 64% were
  women. Average Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score at admission was 33.
  The median referral time to the liver transplant (LT) center was 7 days. The most
  common etiologies were viral hepatitis (27%), indeterminate (21%), autoimmune (18%),
  and Wilson disease (15%). Overall mortality was 52% (71% of transplanted and 46%
  of nontransplanted patients). Dead patients had higher referral time (10 vs 4 days,
  P = .008), higher MELD scores at admission (37 vs 28) and highest achieved MELD
  scores (42 vs 29; P < .001), and higher encephalopathy grade III to IV (94% vs 25%,
  P < .001) than survivors. Patients without LT criteria (n = 4) had lower MELD score
  at admission (25 vs 34, P = .001) and highest achieved MELD score (27 vs 37, P =
  .008) compared with the others. Patients with LT criteria but contraindications
  (n = 7) had higher MELD scores at admission (38 vs 31, P = .02), highest achieved
  MELD scores (41 vs 34, P = .03), and longer referral time (10 days) than those without
  contraindications (3.5 days) or those without LT criteria (7.5 days, P = .02). Twenty-two
  patients were listed; LT was performed in 7, with a median time on waiting list
  of 6 days. CONCLUSIONS: ALF in Uruguay has high mortality associated with delayed
  referral to the LT center, MELD score, and encephalopathy. The long waiting times
  to transplantation might influence mortality."
