input_text: 'Evaluation of Underlying Liver Disease and Its Severity in Children Referred
  for Liver Transplant: a Single-Center Report From Nemazee Hospital of Shiraz. OBJECTIVES:
  Liver transplant has been used as a curative approach for children with end-stage
  liver diseases. Here, we describe the underlying causes for pediatric liver transplant
  performed at the Shiraz Organ Transplantation Center, Nemazee Hospital, Shiraz,
  Iran. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional descriptive study, children
  < 18 years old who were candidates for liver transplant from 2007 to 2010 at the
  Shiraz Organ Transplantation Center were included. Patients were evaluated for their
  underlying diseases leading to liver failure. Disease severity was assessed and
  compared with Pediatric End-Stage Liver Disease model and the Model for End-Stage
  Liver Disease scores. RESULTS: Of 107 patients, 60.8% were males and 39.2% were
  females. The mean age was 11.6 +- 4.9 years. Thirteen patients (12.5%) were < 2
  years old, 26 (24%) were 2 to 6 years old, 33 (30.8%) were 6 to 12 years old, and
  35 (32.7%) were 12 to 18 years old. Underlying liver diseases comprised biliary
  atresia (27.1%), cryptogenic cirrhosis (21.5%), autoimmune cirrhosis (13.1%), familial
  intrahepatic cholestasis (11.2%), Wilson disease (9.3%), tyrosinemia (7.4%), neonatal
  hepatitis (4.7%), congenital hepatic fibrosis (3.7%), and Caroli disease (1.9%).
  Jaundice (83.2%), ascites (57%), and esophageal varices (43%) were the most common
  clinical findings. Mean serum direct bilirubin, total bilirubin, international normalized
  ratio, and serum creatinine values were 3.6 +- 0.8 mg/dL, 9.3 +- 9.1 mg/dL, 2.1
  +- 1.1, and 0.6 +- 0.2 mg/dL, respectively. The mean Pediatric End-Stage Liver Disease
  score in children < 12 years old was 11.4 +- 9.1. The mean Model for EndStage Liver
  Disease score in children > 12 years old was 13.7 +- 5.9. There were no differences
  in scores among sex, age groups, or different etiologies. CONCLUSIONS: Scores for
  disease severity were not significantly different with regard to different causes
  of underlying diseases for liver transplant in Iranian children.'
