input_text: 'A study of MRI changes in Wilson disease and its correlation with clinical
  features and outcome. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the sensitivity of different MRI sequences
  in Wilson disease (WD) with neurological manifestations and its correlation with
  clinical features and outcome. METHODS: 34 WD patients with neurological manifestation
  with a median age of 14 years were included. Their Mini Mental State Examination
  (MMSE) score, movement disorders and laboratory findings were noted. Cranial MRI
  in T1, T2, FLAIR and DW sequences were done. Outcome at 6 months was categorized
  into improved (>1 grade improvement), static or worsening. RESULTS: MRI was abnormal
  in all and revealed involvement of putamen in 29 (85.3%), caudate in 23 (67.6%),
  brainstem and globus pallidus in 21 (61.8%) each, thalamus in 20 (58.8%), cerebral
  cortex in 9 (26.5%), subcortical white matter in 8 (23.5%), and cerebellum in 2
  (5.9%) patients. The overall sensitivity of T2 and FLAIR was 97.1% each, DWI 38.2%
  and T1 31.4%. None had contrast enhancement and 4 had reduced ADC value. Choreoathetosis
  correlated with thalamic, pallidal and putaminal lesions; MMSE with subcortical
  white mater. MRI load correlated with age, tremor, psychiatric disorder, choreoathetosis,
  and severity of WD. At 6 months 9 (26.5%) patients improved, 18 (52.9%) remained
  static and 6 (17.6%) deteriorated. CONCLUSION: In neurologic WD, putaminal involvement
  is the commonest; T2 and FLAIR sequences have similar sensitivity and number of
  MRI lesions correlated with disease severity but not with outcome.'
