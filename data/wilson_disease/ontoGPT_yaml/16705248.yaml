input_text: Treatment of toxic liver damage by antihepatocytotoxic serum. Acute liver
  failure (ALF) is a broad term that refers to both fulminant hepatic failure (FHF)
  and subfulminant hepatic failure (or late-onset hepatic failure). The latter term
  is reserved for patients with liver disease for up to 26 weeks prior to the development
  of hepatic encephalopathy. Some patients with previously unrecognized chronic liver
  disease decompensate and present with liver failure; although this technically is
  not FHF, discerning this at the time of presentation may not be possible (eg, Wilson
  disease). The objective of present research was to define suitable method for the
  treatment of toxic damage of the liver. We consider that liver changes occurred
  in the case of toxic damage can be reversed by administration of antihepatocytotoxic
  serum which has been developed by us. For this purpose we are going to induce liver
  toxic damage in the Wister line and investigate the liver regeneration cellular
  mechanisms after administration of antihepatocytotoxic serum. Experimental investigations
  were performed on Wister line male rats, animals were divided into four equal groups.
  In I and II groups we were modelling acute liver failure by injections of hepatotoxic
  agent CCL4 (I) and performing 70% hepatectomy (II), III group was served as control
  group, and IV group served as donors for HPCs. The main aspect of our study was
  to stimulate liver reparative regeneration and by this help to organ function restoration.
  Performed studies have shown hypertrophy and moderate hyperplasia of hepatocyte
  organelles. Oval shaped HPCs were also observed, Performed investigations had shown
  effectiveness of our ALF treatment method in terms of damaged liver function restoration,
  normalization of morphological picture and biochemical measurements and we hope
  that administration of antihepatocytotoxic serum developed by us can give a chance
  to patients with acute liver failure.
