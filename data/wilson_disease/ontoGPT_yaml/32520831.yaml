input_text: "Pediatric Wilson Disease Presenting as Acute Liver Failure: An Individual
  Patient Data Meta-analysis. OBJECTIVES: Wilson disease (WD) presenting as acute
  liver failure (ALF) is rare and typically fatal without liver transplantation (LT).
  Its rarity has hindered comprehensive studies. We undertook an individual patient
  data meta-analysis to characterize a cohort of pediatric patients presenting with
  ALF whose final diagnosis was WD to examine outcomes and identify predictors of
  poor outcomes. METHODS: Database searches were conducted in PubMed, ScienceDirect,
  and Google Scholar, restricted to English-language articles published between January
  1984 and May 2018. Articles were excluded if pediatric (<18 years old) data were
  not extractable or if LT was not readily available at reporting institutions. Extracted
  data included clinical and biochemical characteristics, genotype, treatment, and
  outcome. RESULTS: Data were available on 249 subjects from 52 articles, plus 7 additional
  subjects identified from our institution's WD database (N = 256). Females represented
  69% (n = 170/245). Median age at presentation was 13.4 years (n = 204, range 4.0-17.9).
  Of the total 256 subjects, 87% underwent LT, 11% achieved spontaneous recovery and
  2% died before LT. International normalized ratio >2.0 at presentation was a predictor
  of LT/death (odds ratio 7.6, 95% confidence interval 1.5-28), with a trend observed
  for hepatic encephalopathy (HE) (odds ratio 4.18, 95% confidence interval 0.99-18).
  Arithmetic diagnostic scores proved inferior in the pediatric age-bracket compared
  to adults. CONCLUSIONS: This large international pediatric cohort has permitted
  an individual patient data analysis of WD presenting as ALF. Notably, 11% of subjects
  achieved spontaneous survival; the rest required LT. Coagulopathy (international
  normalized ratio >2:0) and HE at presentation heralded poor outcomes. Further prospective
  studies may identify additional early predictors of outcomes."
