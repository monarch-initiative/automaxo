input_text: 'Severe Early-Onset Wilson Disease Caused by a Common Pathogenic Variant
  in the Bukharan Jewish Population in Israel. BACKGROUND: Wilson disease is caused
  by pathogenic variants in the ATP7B gene which encodes a copper-transporting ATPase.
  AIMS: Describe a common founder pathogenic variant among Bukharan Jews and to assess
  its prevalence, clinical features, and outcome. METHODS: The cohort consisted of
  patients of Bukharan Jewish descent diagnosed with Wilson disease at a tertiary
  pediatric medical center in 2013-2018. Clinical and genetic data were collected
  and analyzed. RESULTS: Six patients from 4 unrelated families who were homozygous
  for the c.3784G>T p.(Val1262Phe) pathogenic variant in ATP7B were identified. Five
  presented with elevated aminotransferase levels, and one, with acute liver failure.
  Mean age at diagnosis was 8.7 years (5-12.5). Serum ceruloplasmin level was extremely
  low in all patients (1.9-7 mg/dL; mean 3.2(. The variant was identified in a heterozygous
  state in 5/153 Bukharan Jews; 2/33 from our local exome database and 3/120 healthy
  unrelated Bukharan Jews in another cohort, for an estimated carrier frequency of
  ~1:30. CONCLUSIONS: We report a common founder pathogenic variant in the ATP7B gene
  among Bukharan Jews associated with severe early-onset Wilson disease. Given the
  clinical severity, high frequency of the variant, and being a treatable disease,
  its inclusion in pre-symptomatic screening in the Bukharan Jewish community should
  be considered. Furthermore, WD should be part of future genetic newborn screening
  programs in Israel and worldwide, to enable early treatment and prevention of future
  life-threatening complications.'
