input_text: 'Hepatic decompensation in patients with cirrhosis during infection with
  influenza A. BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic liver disease can develop hepatic
  decompensation during systemic infections. Although gram-negative and gram-positive
  bacteria are well recognized as causes of decompensation, the effect of influenza
  virus infection on patients with chronic liver disease is poorly documented. METHODS:
  Retrospective analysis of patients with positive viral cultures who were seen at
  a liver transplantation clinic in a tertiary care referral center during the 1997-1998
  influenza A (H3N2) epidemic in San Diego, Calif. RESULTS: Three patients with end-stage
  liver disease (1 with Wilson disease and 2 with alcoholic liver disease) developed
  hepatic decompensation and required hospitalization during infection with influenza
  A. Two patients had biochemical and clinical evidence of hepatic decompensation,
  including ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and peripheral edema, and the third had
  acute hepatocellular damage, with elevated levels of aminotransferases. Viral hepatitis
  serologic test results, acetaminophen levels, drug and alcohol screening findings,
  and bacterial and fungal cultures were negative in all 3 patients. Hepatic decompensation
  resolved without the need for transplantation in the 2 patients with liver failure,
  and all patients recovered to their baseline liver function levels within 1 month
  of onset of acute illness. CONCLUSIONS: Influenza A infection can cause hepatic
  decompensation and hospitalization in patients having cirrhosis or who are awaiting
  liver transplantation. Effective prevention with vaccination and early recognition
  and treatment of influenza are strongly recommended in these individuals.'
