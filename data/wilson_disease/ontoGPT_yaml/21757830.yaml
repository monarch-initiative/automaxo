input_text: Excess copper chelating therapy for Wilson disease induces anemia and
  liver dysfunction. A 37-year-old man was diagnosed with Wilson disease at the age
  of 14. His first manifestations were neurological. He was treated with trientine
  for more than 10 years and suffered from anemia and liver dysfunction. Wilson disease
  is a genetic disorder characterized by accumulation of copper in the body. Excess
  copper is toxic, but copper is an essential trace element. Copper-binding ceruloplasmin
  is important for iron metabolism. Excess copper chelating treatment-induced anemia
  and iron deposition in the liver was suspected. Proper monitoring of copper status
  is important for the management of Wilson disease.
