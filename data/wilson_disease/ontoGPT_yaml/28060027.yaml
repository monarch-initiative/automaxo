input_text: 'Advantages of Anterior Segment Optical Coherence Tomography Evaluation
  of the Kayser-Fleischer Ring in Wilson Disease.PURPOSE: To present anterior segment
  optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) findings of the Kayser-Fleischer (KF) ring
  in Wilson disease (WD) and to discuss the potential advantages of evaluating the
  KF ring by AS-OCT. METHODS: This is a retrospective case series of 7 patients with
  WD with KF rings seen in our institute during the study period (August 2015 to June
  2016). All patients underwent slit-lamp examination of the cornea and AS-OCT (Optovue
  RTVue Premier). In 2 patients, the length of the KF ring was measured using the
  gray scale of AS-OCT. RESULTS: The KF ring on the gray scale of AS-OCT was visualized
  as a hyperreflective deep corneal layer at the level of Descemet membrane in all
  eyes. The OCT color scale revealed the KF ring as a greenish, greenish-yellow, yellow,
  or yellow-orange band. The gray scale of AS-OCT could easily measure the length
  of the KF ring in patients 6 and 7. CONCLUSIONS: AS-OCT is an alternative method
  of evaluating the KF ring in WD, which can be used in combination with slit-lamp
  examination. The KF ring can be easily measured using the gray scale of AS-OCT.
  Further studies are required to study the potential advantages of AS-OCT including
  assessing the density of the KF ring, as a tool to assess response to treatment
  in WD, in differentiating the KF ring of WD disease from copper deposits in other
  situations and pigmented corneal rings in non-Wilsonian liver disease.'
