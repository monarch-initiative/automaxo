input_text: 'Diminution of toxic copper accumulation in toxic milk mice modeling Wilson
  disease by embryonic hepatocyte intrasplenic transplantation. AIM: To observe the
  therapeutic effect of intrasplenic transplantation with embryonic hepatocytes on
  amelioration of hereditary copper accumulation in toxic milk (TX) mouse modeling
  Wilson disease. METHODS: Donor hepatocytes were harvested from 14-d fetal liver
  of a pregnant homogeneous DL mouse. These cells were successively cultured, labeled
  with fluorescein dye Hoechst 33342 for 24 h, and sequentially infused into the spleen
  parenchyma of the recipient TX mice. No host immunosuppression measures were taken.
  Two and four weeks after transplantation, the recipients were killed for routine
  histologic investigation and immunohistochemistry study up to 4 wk after transplantation.
  The serum copper and ceruloplasmin concentrations of the recipient mice were determined
  by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy. RESULTS: In the following 2nd
  and 4th wk after transplantation, the donor hepatocytes could be visualized in the
  livers of 47.3% recipients. The serum ceruloplasmin and copper concentrations increased
  by 1.6-fold after 2 wk and 2.0-fold times after 4 wk respectively, which ultimately
  rose from about 30% of the normal level to nearly 60% (P<0.01). The hepatic copper
  concentration decreased 7.2%, 4 wk after transplantation. Pathologic examination
  showed that there were many actively proliferative hepatocyte precursor cells with
  specific embryonic hepatocyte marker AFP migrated into hepatic sinusoids of the
  recipients. A large number of cells carrying hepatocytes marker and albumin were
  observed in the recipient spleen tissues. CONCLUSION: Embryonic hepatocytes are
  capable of differentiating into mature hepatocytes in vivo. After transplantation,
  the hereditary abnormalities of copper metabolism in TX mice could be corrected
  partially by intrasplenic transplantation of homogeneous embryonic hepatocytes.'
