input_text: 'Does lesioning surgery have a role in the management of multietiological
  tremor in the era of Deep Brain Stimulation? INTRODUCTION: Surgical management of
  tremor has evolved over the years with Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) gradually supplanting
  lesioning as the mainstay in treatment. In this article, the largest of its kind
  from our country, we present our experience in the use of lesioning in the management
  of patients with multietiological tremors. These include not only common indications
  like Parkinson disease and essential tremor but also rare causes such as Pantothenate
  kinase associated neurodegeneration (PKAN), multiple sclerosis (MS) and Wilson disease.
  MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with medically refractory tremor who underwent surgery
  were included in the analysis. A comprehensive clinical and radiological evaluation
  was performed which was repeated 3 months postoperatively and at successive visits.
  Video documentation of was obtained at all visits. RESULTS: A total of 21 patients
  (18 men, 3 women) with an average age 37.7 years (range 21-65 years) underwent stereotactic
  thalamotomy/subthalamotomy at our institute between 2008 and 2013, for the treatment
  of medically refractory tremor of varying etiologies. The mean preoperative duration
  of symptoms was 11 years (range 10 months to 34 years). The median time to onset
  of improvement was 2 months (range 1 week to 8 months). Analyzing the improvement
  on the modified FTM scale, in part 1 the scores improved from 21.7 to 1.5, the part
  II subset improved from an average of 9.2 to 3.2 while the part III subset improved
  from an average of 14.1 to 4.1 postoperatively. This implied an excellent response
  in tremor while the other 2 components had a very good response. DISCUSSION: In
  this study we have for the first time objectively analyzed the tremor improvement
  with a modified FTM scale and have produced excellent results. We have also shown
  that tremor of various etiologies respond extremely well to lesioning surgery. While
  DBS continues to remain the treatment of choice in various types of bilateral tremor,
  lesioning is very successful in a carefully selected cohort of patients. We are
  of the opinion that in predominantly unilateral tremor or when the patient cannot
  afford DBS especially in a country like ours, lesioning surgery is an important
  tool in the armamentarium of the functional neurosurgeon.'
