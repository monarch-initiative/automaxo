input_text: 'Myocardial integrated ultrasonic backscatter for early detection of cardiac
  involvement in patients with Wilson disease. BACKGROUND/AIMS: Videodensitometry
  is a feasible noninvasive ultrasound tissue characterization method allowing early
  detection of myocardial changes. This study aimed to investigate ultrasonic backscatter
  properties of the myocardium in Wilson disease patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
  We compared cardiologically asymptomatic Wilson disease patients (W group) (n=18)
  with age-matched (26.7+-9.6 years) healthy controls (C group) (n=15). Diagnosis
  of Wilson disease was made on the basis of clinical manifestations, family history,
  and laboratory findings and confirmed by liver biopsy. Transthoracic echocardiographic
  quantitative texture analysis was performed on data from the septum and left ventricular
  posterior wall, and mean gray level (MGL) histograms at end-diastole (d) and end-systole
  (s) were obtained after background correction (c). Cyclic variation index (CVI)
  was calculated using the formula [(cMGLd - cMGLs) / cMGLd] x100. RESULTS: There
  were no significant differences in sex, age, body mass index, heart rate or blood
  pressure, and conventional echocardiographic parameters between the 2 groups. The
  cMGLs value of the posterior wall was higher in the W group than in the C group
  (30.9+-2.6 vs. 22.2+-2.7, p=0.033). The W group had a significantly lower CVI of
  the septum than did the C group (-22+-4.4% vs. 43.4 +-12.9%, p<0.001), and there
  was no significant difference in the CVI of the posterior wall (-67.0+-15.9% vs.
  41.7+-18.6%, p=0.32). CONCLUSION: Abnormalities in two-dimensional echocardiographic
  grey-level distributions were present in Wilson disease patients. These videodensitometric
  myocardial alterations were significantly lower in Wilson disease patients than
  in the controls, and this probably represents an early stage of cardiac involvement.'
