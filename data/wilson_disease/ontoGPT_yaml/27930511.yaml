input_text: "Four-year follow-up of a Wilson disease pedigree complicated with epilepsy
  and hypopituitarism: Case report with a literature review. RATIONALE: Wilson's disease
  (WD) is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder of copper metabolism with excellent
  prognosis if treated timely. However, WD is usually prone to neglect and misdiagnosis
  at an early stage. We reported a rare WD pedigree, and the clinical features, laboratory
  tests, and gene mutations were analyzed in detail. PATIENT CONCERNS: The patient
  was a 17-year-old and 136-cm-tall girl who presented with limb weakness, combined
  with multi-organ disorders including blind eye, epilepsy, and hypopituitarism. DIAGNOSES:
  Clinical tests showed a low serum ceruloplasmin level, high urinary copper excretion
  and Kayser-Fleischer (K-F) rings. She carried a compound heterozygous mutations
  in ATP7B gene (c.2828G>A and c.3884C>T). Her younger brother, as an asymptomatic
  patient, manifested with elevation of transaminases but without neurological and
  hepatic symptoms. They were diagnosed as WD finally. INTERVENTIONS: They were treated
  with sodium dimercaptosulphonate, supplemented with zinc gluconate, vitamin B6,
  vitamin C, as well as restriction of dietary copper. OUTCOMES: The urinary copper
  excretion and serum transaminase level decreased gradually. The abnormal signals
  in brainstem and basal ganglia were also remarkably decreased after 4-year of de-copper
  treatment. LESSONS: As to the patients with complicated clinical manifestations,
  the extrapyramidal symptom and basal ganglia signals should be concerned. The serum
  ceruloplasmin detection and ATP7B gene mutation screening are necessary."
