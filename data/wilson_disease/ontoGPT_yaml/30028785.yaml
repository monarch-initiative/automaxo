input_text: 'Transplant-free Survival in Chronic Liver Disease Presenting as Acute
  Liver Failure in Childhood. BACKGROUND: In adults, the absence of a preexisting
  chronic liver disease (CLD) is required to diagnose acute liver failure (ALF). The
  pediatric classification does not consider this aspect, thus previous studies pooled
  together children with ALF and children with unknown CLD presenting with acute hepatic
  decompensation (ALF-CLD). We aimed to compare prevalence, features, and outcome
  of children with ALF-CLD to those with a proper ALF. METHODS: Patients admitted
  between 1996 and 2017 because of ALF defined by Pediatric Acute Liver Failure criteria
  (raised transaminases, International Normal Ratio >=2.0, no history of liver disease)
  were classified as ALF-CLD if diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson disease,
  Budd-Chiari syndrome, hepatitis B virus reactivation, inborn errors of metabolism.
  The others were classified as ALF. RESULTS: Seventy-four children (median age, 4
  years; 1.0-8.8; male/female, 36/38] with ALF were found; 18 of <1 year of age were
  excluded. Fifty-six (median age, 6.6 years; 2.7-11.7; male/female, 23/33], 22 with
  ALF-CLD (autoimmune hepatitis, n = 14; Wilson disease, n = 6; inborn errors of metabolism,
  n = 2) and 34 with ALF (paracetamol overdose, n = 6; viral infections, n = 3; mushroom
  poisoning, n = 5; indeterminate, n = 20) were compared. In ALF-CLD, the median age
  at onset was higher, alanine aminotransferase, albumin, and International Normal
  Ratio levels were lower, splenomegaly, ascites, and cirrhosis were more common (all
  P < 0.01). On multivariate analysis, the diagnosis of ALF-CLD was an independent
  predictor of transplant-free survival (P = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: In children, ALF-CLD
  is common, has peculiar features, and is associated with a favorable outcome. This
  study suggests the need to distinguish this entity from other forms of ALF in children.'
