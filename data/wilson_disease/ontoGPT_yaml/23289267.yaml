input_text: '[Wilson disease as the significant risk factor of surgical treatment--clinical
  case report]. Wilson Disease (W ) is a rare inborn disorder of cooper metabolism.
  In approximately 40% of cases signs and symptoms of abnormal liver functions are
  observed due to hepatic inflammation, cirrhosis or insufficiency. The mainstay treatment
  is the conservative treatment with zinc (eg Zincteral) or penicillamine. The Authors
  present a patient with WD who underwent surgery because of an advanced rectal prolapse
  (laparotomy, rectal mobilization, rectopexy, the partial sigmoid colon resection
  with the primary anastomosis). The postoperative course was complicated by anastomotic
  leakage and a subsequent diffuse peritonitis. The patient required relaparotomy
  and three weeks treatment in the intensive therapy unit. The Authors consider the
  WD as a significant risk factor for surgical patients. Surgical treatment of patients
  with WD should be least invasive.'
