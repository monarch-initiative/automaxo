input_text: 'Controversies and Variation in Diagnosing and Treating Children With
  Wilson Disease: Results of an International Survey. OBJECTIVES: Variation in care
  is more common in settings in which evidence-based approaches are limited. The aims
  of the present study were to describe consensus and variability in approaches taken
  by pediatric hepatologists in the management of Wilson disease (WD) in children.
  METHOD: International case-centered, Internet-based survey of pediatric hepatologists.
  Survey cases were developed by consensus of the authors and were intended to identify
  variation in the care of children with WD. RESULTS: One hundred eleven of 253 clinicians
  responded (44%). Of these, 84% of North American and 41% of European participants
  used guidelines published in their respective region. Although consensus existed
  on the first-line diagnostic tools (serum ceruloplasmin and baseline 24-hour urinary
  copper excretion), survey participants did not agree on how much liver copper content
  was required for diagnosis: 57% considered >250 mug/g dry weight to be consistent
  with WD, whereas 25% considered >50 mug/g to be diagnostic. Overall, 50% of practitioners
  perform genetic testing in all suspected cases, and 81% perform genetic testing
  once they know the genotype of an index patient. For initial treatment of fulminant
  WD, 51% of participants chose chelation and 15% chose immediate transplantation;
  47% chose listing for transplantation followed by monitoring using a disease-severity
  score, and then carrying out transplantation only when the score reached a critical
  cut-off. To treat mildly affected siblings of index patients, 43% of practitioners
  chose zinc. Most reported that they use chelation to treat patients with hepatic
  dysfunction; however, 29% of North American participants chose not to use D-penicillamine
  as primary therapy. CONCLUSIONS: From an international perspective, pediatric hepatologists
  vary in the approaches they use in the care for children with WD. Regional preferences
  and accessibility to treatments may generate variation. Unwarranted variation, however,
  may also contribute to differences in outcome and should be targeted to improve
  quality of care.'
