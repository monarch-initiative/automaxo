input_text: 'Clinical and genetic analysis of pediatric patients with Wilson disease.
  BACKGROUND/AIMS: Wilson disease (WD, MIM# 277900) is an autosomal recessive disorder
  of copper transport resulting from the defective function of a copper transporting
  P-type ATPase. Detecting mutations and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of
  the ATP7B gene in Turkish pediatric WD patients (n=32) and controls (n=52) is the
  aim of this research. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For screening mutations and SNPs of
  the ATP7B gene, sequencing was performed. RESULTS: Mutations were determined in
  the ATP7B gene in 23 out of the 32 pediatric patients. The mutation detection rate
  in the ATP7B gene of the pediatric Turkish WD patients was 71.875%. Fifteen different
  mutations were determined in the ATP7B gene. These mutations were distributed throughout
  the ATP7B gene and were as follows: 2 deletion, 1 insertion, 3 nonsense, and 9 missense
  mutations. Four of these, including c.3111delC (1 deletion) and c.2363C>T, c.3733C>A,
  and c.3451C>T (3 missense) mutations, were detected in the Turkish WD patients.
  Eleven polymorphisms were detected in both groups. Among these, c.3727G>A (SNP)
  was reported in the Wilson Disease Mutation Database by our group. Nine out of the
  thirty-two pediatric Turkish WD patients had no mutations in the ATP7B gene. CONCLUSION:
  To find the cause of WD in pediatric patients who have no mutation in ATP7B, additional
  research is necessary.'
