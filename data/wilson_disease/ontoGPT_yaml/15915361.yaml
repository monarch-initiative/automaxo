input_text: '[Wilson disease]. Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive inherited
  disorder of human copper metabolism that leads to neurological symptoms and hepatic
  damage of variable degree. The affected gene ATP7B encodes a hepatic copper transport
  protein, which plays a key role in human copper metabolism. Clinical symptoms are
  complex with neurologic symptoms such as tremor, dysarthria, psychiatric disorders
  etc., predominant hepatic disease or mixed forms. Copper deposition in the liver
  results in acute liver failure, chronic hepatitis or liver cirrhosis. Early recognition
  by means of clinical, biochemical or genetic examination and early initiation of
  therapy with chelators or zinc-salts are essential for outcome and prognosis. Liver
  transplantation is an alternative in cases with acute and chronic liver failure
  and cures the hepatic disease. Frequent monitoring of drug therapy, adverse effects,
  and compliance is critical for the prognosis of the disease.'
