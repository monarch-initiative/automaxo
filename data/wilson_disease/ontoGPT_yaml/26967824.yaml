input_text: 'Pediatric Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure in a Specialized Liver Unit:
  Prevalence, Profile, Outcome, and Predictive Factors. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the
  study was to assess the prevalence, profile, outcome, and predictive factors of
  pediatric acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF). METHODS: All children 3 months
  to 18 years satisfying the Asia Pacific Association for the Study of Liver Diseases
  definition of ACLF were included. Data were both extracted from records (January
  2011 to December 2014) and prospectively collected (January to October 2015). Successful
  outcome was defined as survival with native liver at 90 days, whereas poor outcome
  included those who died or received liver transplantation. RESULTS: Of the 499 children
  with chronic liver disease (CLD), 56 (11.2%) presented as ACLF, with a mean age
  of 9.35 (+-4.39) years. Wilson disease and autoimmune hepatitis were the commonest
  underlying CLDs accounting for 24 (42.8%) and 18 (32.1%) cases, respectively. The
  most frequent events precipitating ACLF were a flare up of the underlying disease
  in 27 (48.2%) and acute viral hepatitis in 17 (30%). Poor outcome occurred in 22
  (39.3%) children: 17 (30.4%) died and 5 (8.9%) received liver transplantation. Poor
  outcome was associated with grades 3 to 4 hepatic encephalopathy, bilirubin >=17.5,
  international normalized ratio >=3.5, and presence of 2 or more organ failures.
  On multivariate analysis, a Chronic Liver Failure-Sequential Organ Failure Assessment
  score >=10 best predicted mortality (odds ratio 20.45, 95% confidence interval 3.9-106.7).
  CONCLUSIONS: ACLF is present in 11.2% of childhood CLD, with a 90-day native liver
  survival of 61%. A Chronic Liver Failure-Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score
  of >=10 best predicts mortality at day 90.'
