input_text: "[Compliance with treatment in Wilson's disease: On the interest of a
  multidisciplinary closer follow-up]. BACKGROUND: Compliance with treatment is very
  important for patients who suffer from Wilson's disease, a rare genetic disorder.
  They can benefit a long-life and effective treatment. The purpose of our study is
  to identify the level of compliance in Wilson's disease patients and features associated
  with compliance as well. METHODS: This is a prospective study carried out in the
  National Reference Center for Wilson Disease (based in Paris and Lyon) over a 8
  months period. Patients were evaluated on the first (M0) and last month (M8) with
  a questionnaire evaluating the number of missed treatment doses, a self-questionnaire
  collecting the reasons for non-compliance, and analogic scales analyzing the doctor-patient
  relationship and their behavior towards the treatment. The severity of depression
  symptoms was investigated by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). A detailed phone
  call interview was conducted by a psychologist every two months to evaluate their
  compliance and feeling. RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients were included. The mean age
  of patients was 34 years (+-9.9). At M0, 84.6% had a poor compliance with treatment.
  They were diagnosed more recently (P=0.049) with a higher proportion involving neurological
  disorders (P=0.007). Age, the type of treatment and the quality of the doctor-patient
  relationship were not associated with the outcome; 38.5% suffered from depressive
  symptoms. At M8, 56.8% of patients were poor compliants and 21.6% presented depressive
  symptoms. CONCLUSION: Wilsons's disease patients have important problems with compliance,
  without necessary being depressed. A close follow-up may help them become compliant,
  particularly those with neurological symptoms."
