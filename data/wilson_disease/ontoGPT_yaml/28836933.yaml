input_text: Intracerebral Hemorrhage Related With Penicillium Species Following Deceased-Donor
  Liver Transplant. Early or late posttransplant opportunistic infections are among
  the leading complications after liver transplant. The source of early posttransplant
  opportunistic infections is usually the patient, the implantation of an infected
  graft, contamination during a surgical procedure, or invasive interventions performed
  at the intensive care unit. A 10-year-old male patient with Wilson disease (Pediatric
  End-Stage Liver Disease Score of 42, Child-Pugh score of 12, total bilirubin 40
  mg/dL, platelet count 55000/mL, hemoglobin level 6.3 g/dL, albumin level 1.7 g/dL,
  urinary copper level 4305 mu/24 h) was closely monitored in the pediatric intensive
  care unit of our liver transplantation center for care of a worsened general status.
  A deceased-donor liver transplant was performed using a right lobe liver graft (ex
  vivo split) obtained through the national organ sharing network. The patient developed
  rightward deviation of eyes and altered consciousness after the procedure and underwent
  cranial magnetic resonance imaging and computerized tomography examinations. The
  cranial magnetic resonance image, taken on the third postoperative day, revealed
  lesions consistent with embolic infarction, and the computed tomography scan, taken
  on the eighth day, showed intracerebral hemorrhage. Decompressive craniotomy, which
  included hematoma drainage and catheter placement, was performed. Culture and histopathologic
  examinations of the hematoma material revealed a Penicillium species of fungi. However,
  the patient died before a definitive diagnosis was made. The aim of this report
  is to raise awareness on early posttransplant opportunistic infections of the central
  nervous system presenting with intracranial hemorrhage following liver transplant.
