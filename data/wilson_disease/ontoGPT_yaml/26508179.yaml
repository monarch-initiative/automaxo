input_text: Radionuclide cholescintigraphy in genetically confirmed Rotor syndrome.
  A 7-year-old girl had been followed up for persistent conjugated hyperbilirubinemia
  since birth. Alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl
  transpeptidase activity was within the normal range, and liver protein synthesis
  had always been normal. Infectious etiology of jaundice, autoimmune diseases, drug-induced
  liver injury, hemolytic anemia, alpha-1 anti-trypsin deficiency, Wilson disease
  and Gilbert syndrome were ruled out. At the age of 8 years the patient underwent
  radionuclide dynamic cholescintigraphy, indicating poor accumulation of the radiotracer
  in the liver on one hand, and severe retention of the radiopharmaceutical in the
  blood pool (including the heart) on the other hand. Rotor syndrome was suspected
  and finally confirmed on molecular analysis. This case represents the first cholescintigraphy
  report in a pediatric patient with genetically proven Rotor syndrome.
