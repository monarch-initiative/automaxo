input_text: "Acute Liver Failure due to Wilson Disease: Eight Years of the National
  Liver Transplant Program in Uruguay. INTRODUCTION AND AIM: Wilson's disease (WD)
  is an uncommon cause of acute liver failure (ALF). Our aim was to describe clinical
  features, diagnostic findings, treatments, and outcomes of patients with ALF due
  to WD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective medical record reviews of all patients
  with ALF due to WD in eight years in Uruguay. RESULTS: WD was the cause of six (15%)
  of thirty-nine ALF cases. All patients were females, with a mean age of 18 years.
  Four patients presented with hyperacute liver failure and two with acute failure.
  Jaundice was the main complaint of all patients. Mean total bilirubin (TB), alkaline
  phosphatase (AP), AST, and ALT were 27.5 mg/dL, 45.5 lU/l, 156 IU/L, and 51 IU/L,
  respectively. Ceruloplasmin levels were low in four patients, urinary cooper was
  high in four, and two had Kayser-Fleischer rings. All patients had Coombs-negative
  hemolytic anemia, acute kidney injury, histochemical identifiable copper, and advanced
  fibrosis on liver histology. The average MELD score was 36. All patients were treated
  with d-penicillamine and listed for urgent liver transplantation (LT). Prometheus\
  \  was performed in one patient. Three patients died: two without LT and one after
  LT. Three patients survived: one without LT (New Wilson Index<11) and two with LT.
  The referral time to the program and the total time (referral plus waiting list
  time) were longer for non-survivors than for survivors (14 vs. 3 days and 23 vs.
  8 respectively). CONCLUSION: All cases had typical clinical, analytical and histopathology
  characteristics. Early referral was determinant of prognosis."
