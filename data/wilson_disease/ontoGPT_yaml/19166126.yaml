input_text: "Haemolytic anaemia and acute liver failure--the initial manifestations
  of Wilson's disease. We describe a case of a 16-year-old girl with Wilson disease,
  which was initially presented as Coombs-negative haemolytic anaemia and acute liver
  failure. The diagnosis was based on the findings of low ceruloplasmin serum level
  and high copper levels both in serum and 24-hour urinary excretion. The patient
  underwent orthotopic liver transplantation. A DNA-based diagnostic tool confirmed
  Wilson's disease: the patient was p.H1069Q homozygote. Based on further molecular-genetic
  examinations in the family, Wilson disease was diagnosed seven days later in one
  of the patient's asymptomatic brothers. The proband's cousin was confirmed as a
  carrier of the p.H1069Q mutation (Fig. 1, Ref. 24)."
