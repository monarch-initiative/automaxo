input_text: "Penicillamine-related neurologic syndrome in a child affected by Wilson
  disease with hepatic presentation. OBJECTIVES: To describe a case of penicillamine-related
  neurologic symptoms in a 9-year-old boy affected by asymptomatic Wilson disease
  with hepatic presentation; to compare this case with similar cases in adults; and
  to discuss the role of zinc therapy as an alternative treatment for patients who
  have an adverse reaction to penicillamine therapy. SETTING: Referral hospital. MAIN
  OUTCOME MEASURE: The occurrence of a neurologic syndrome that severely impaired
  a child's usual daily activities and his health-related quality of life after the
  institution of penicillamine therapy. RESULTS: Initial penicillamine therapy was
  chronologically related to the development of progressive neurologic deterioration
  in the absence of other causes of neurologic syndrome. The discontinuation of penicillamine
  therapy and the initiation of zinc therapy were followed by a prompt disappearance
  of neurologic symptoms and a return to neurologic baseline status. CONCLUSIONS:
  Penicillamine therapy, even in children affected by Wilson disease with hepatic
  presentation alone and without neurologic disease at the beginning of treatment,
  may trigger neurologic symptoms. Zinc therapy may be a satisfactory alternative."
