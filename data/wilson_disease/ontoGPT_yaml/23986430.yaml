input_text: 'Effect of liver transplantation on brain magnetic resonance imaging pathology
  in Wilson disease: a case report. The authors present a case report of a 28-year-old
  patient with hepatic, but no neurological, signs of Wilson disease, with pathological
  changes in both the globi pallidi and caudate found with routine brain magnetic
  resonance imaging (MRI). The patient was recommended for liver transplantation by
  hepatologists, and during the two years of observation after liver transplantation,
  MRI brain abnormalities due to Wilson disease completely regressed. On the basis
  of this case, the authors present an argument for the prognostic significance of
  brain MRI in Wilson disease as well as current recommendations concerning liver
  transplantation in Wilson disease.'
