input_text: 'Zinc Therapy for Wilson Disease in Children in French Pediatric Centers.
  BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Zinc therapy is considered a good option in Wilson disease
  (WD), as a first-line treatment in presymptomatic children and a maintenance therapy
  after the initial chelator therapy. The aim of the study was to determine the practical
  use of zinc treatment in French pediatric centers. METHODS: A national survey was
  conducted in the 6 French centers using zinc acetate to treat WD. Clinical and biological
  parameters, dosage, and outcome were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 26 children were
  reported to be treated with zinc acetate, alone or in association with chelators.
  Of the 9 children (35%) who received zinc alone as a first-line therapy, 2 were
  switched to D-penicillamine because of inefficacy and 7 remained on zinc alone,
  but serum transaminase levels normalized in only 4 of them. Five children (19%)
  were initially treated with zinc in association with D-penicillamine (n = 4) or
  Trientine (n = 1) with good efficacy. Among the 12 children (46%) who received zinc
  as a maintenance therapy after D-penicillamine, no relapse of hepatic cytolysis
  occurred during a median follow-up of 5.2 years, but 2 of them were switched to
  Trientine because of zinc-related adverse effects. Epigastric pain was observed
  in 4 children, and a gastric perforation occurred in 1 child. CONCLUSIONS: The present
  study demonstrates poor efficacy of zinc as first-line therapy to control liver
  disease in half presymptomatic children and a high incidence of related gastrointestinal
  adverse effects in children with WD.'
