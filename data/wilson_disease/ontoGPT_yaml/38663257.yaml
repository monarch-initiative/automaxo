input_text: Exploration of TCM syndrome types of the material basis and risk prediction
  of Wilson disease liver fibrosis based on 1H NMR metabolomics. Wilson disease (WD)
  is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by abnormal copper metabolism.
  The accumulation of copper in the liver can progress to liver fibrosis and, ultimately,
  cirrhosis, which is a primary cause of death in WD patients. Metabonomic technology
  offers an effective approach to investigate the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM)
  syndrome types of WD-related liver fibrosis by monitoring the alterations in small
  molecule metabolites within the body. In this study, we employed 1H-Nuclear Magnetic
  Resonance (1H NMR) metabonomics to assess the metabolic profiles associated with
  five TCM syndrome types of WD-related liver fibrosis and analyzed the diagnostic
  and predictive capabilities of various metabolites. The study found a variety of
  metabolites, each with varying levels of diagnostic and predictive capabilities.
  Furthermore, the discerned differential metabolic pathways were primarily associated
  with various pathways involving carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid metabolism,
  and lipid metabolism. This study has identified various characteristic metabolic
  markers and pathways associated with different TCM syndromes of liver fibrosis in
  WD, providing a substantial foundation for investigating the mechanisms underlying
  these TCM syndromes.
