input_text: "Cardiac arrest in Wilson's disease after curative liver transplantation:
  a life-threatening complication of myocardial copper excess? We report the case
  of a 38-year-old man who presented with cardiac arrest 1 year after curative liver
  transplantation for Wilson's disease. Clinical work-up proofed myocardial copper
  and iron accumulation using mass spectrometry, which led most likely to myocardial
  fibrosis as visualized by cardiovascular magnetic resonance (unprecedented delayed
  enhancement pattern) and endomyocardial biopsy. Consequently, cardiac arrest due
  to ventricular fibrillation and subsequent episodes of sustained ventricular tachycardia
  were considered as primary cardiac manifestation of Wilson's disease. This can,
  as illustrated by our case, occur even late after curative liver transplantation,
  which is an important fact that treating physicians should be aware of during clinical
  follow-up of these patients."
