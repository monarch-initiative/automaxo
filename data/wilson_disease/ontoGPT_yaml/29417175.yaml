input_text: 'The steady state pharmacokinetics of trientine in Wilson disease patients.
  PURPOSE: To determine the steady state pharmacokinetics of trientine in children
  (>= 12 years of age) and adult patients who had been receiving trientine dihydrochloride
  therapy prior to the study. METHODS: Twenty patients were exposed to trientine (trientine
  dihydrochloride capsules supplied by Univar) after standard oral dosing as part
  of ongoing therapy. Plasma trientine concentration was determined pre-dose and at
  30 min, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 12 h post-dose. Concentrations of trientine
  in plasma were determined by LC-MS/MS using a validated bioanalytical method with
  stable labelled trientine as the internal standard. RESULTS: Trientine was generally
  absorbed fairly rapidly with a median Tmax of 1.49 h (range, 0.48-4.08 h). There
  was some variability in exposure, with a 10-fold range in Cmax, and a 13.8-fold
  range in AUC0-t. This variability was slightly lower when PK parameters were dose-normalised
  (6.7-fold range in Cmax/D and an 11.6-fold range in AUC0-t/D). The terminal half-life,
  which could be defined in 14 of the 20 patients, was broadly consistent between
  patients (range of 2.33 to 6.99 h). There was no marked difference in pharmacokinetics
  between adult patients (n = 16) and children (n = 4). The Cmax range was 506 to
  3100 ng/mL in adults and 309 to 1940 ng/mL in children-the equivalent ranges for
  AUC0-t were 1240 to 17,100 ng/mL h and 1500 to 8060 ng/mL h. When PK parameters
  were normalised for administered dose, the Cmax/D and AUC0-t/D for children were
  contained within the ranges for the adult patients. CONCLUSIONS: The steady state
  pharmacokinetics of trientine in Wilson disease patients were broadly similar to
  that reported in healthy subjects.'
