input_text: 'Diffusion tensor imaging of the extracorticospinal network in the brains
  of patients with Wilson disease. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate damage to the extracorticospinal
  tract in Wilson disease (WD) patients using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). METHODS:
  70 patients with WD, including 50 with cerebral type and 20 with hepatic type, and
  20 age-matched healthy controls were enrolled. Neurological symptoms were scored
  using the modified Young Scale. Patients with cerebral type WD were divided into
  four subgroups: those with (1) hypokinesia, (2) parkinsonism, (3) mouth and throat
  dystonia, and (4) psychiatric symptoms. All study subjects underwent DTI of the
  brain. Five regions of interest (ROIs) were chosen. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and
  fiber volumes between ROIs were determined, and the relationships between DTI metrics
  and clinical status were evaluated. RESULTS: FA values and fiber volumes between
  subcortical nuclei were lower in WD patients. Fiber volumes between the putamen
  (PU) and the globus pallidus (GP), substantia nigra (SN), and thalamus (TH); between
  the head of the caudate nucleus (CA) and the GP and TH; and between the TH and cerebellum
  were lower in group 1 than in the other groups of WD patients. Fiber volumes between
  the GP and the SN and TH were lower in group 2, and fiber volumes between the SN
  and TH were lower in group 3. DTI metrics differed between patients with the cerebral
  and hepatic types of WD. CONCLUSIONS: DTI can reconstruct the network of the extracorticospinal
  tract. Fiber projection between subcortical nuclei was abnormal in WD patients.
  Damage to fiber connections may correlate with neurological symptoms in WD patients.'
