input_text: 'Wilson Disease With Giant Splenic Artery Aneurysms Caused by Fibromuscular
  Dysplasia During Living Donor Liver Transplantation: A Case Report. Liver cirrhosis
  can cause splenic artery aneurysms (SAA) that pose a threat to patients undergoing
  liver transplantation. However, liver transplantation with multiple visceral artery
  aneurysms including giant SAA caused by arterial fragility has never been reported.
  We describe a 36-year-old man with decompensated liver cirrhosis due to Wilson disease
  that was complicated by giant SAA and multiple aneurysms in the bilateral renal
  arteries caused by fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD). The maximal diameter of the triple
  snowball-shaped SAA was 11 cm. We planned a 2-stage strategy consisting of a splenectomy
  with distal pancreatectomy to treat the SAA and subsequent living donor liver transplantation
  (LDLT) to address the liver cirrhosis. This strategy was selected to prevent fatal
  postoperative infectious complications caused by the potential development of pancreatic
  fistula during simultaneous procedures and to histopathologically diagnose the arterial
  lesion before LDLT to promote safe hepatic artery reconstruction. However, a postoperative
  pancreatic fistula did not develop after a splenectomy with distal pancreatectomy,
  and the pathologic findings of the artery indicated FMD. The patient underwent ABO-identical
  LDLT with a right lobe graft donated by his brother. Other than postoperative rupture
  of the aneurysm in the left renal artery requiring emergency interventional radiology,
  the patient has remained free of any other arterial complications and continues
  to do well at 2 years after LDLT.'
