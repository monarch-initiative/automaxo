input_text: 'Early stage transplantation of bone marrow cells markedly ameliorates
  copper metabolism and restores liver function in a mouse model of Wilson disease.
  BACKGROUND: Recent studies have demonstrated that normal bone marrow (BM) cells
  transplantation can correct liver injury in a mouse model of Wilson disease (WD).
  However, it still remains unknown when BM cells transplantation should be administered.
  The aim of this study was to investigate the potential impact of normal BM cells
  transplantation at different stages of WD to correct liver injury in toxic milk
  (tx) mice. METHODS: Recipient tx mice were sublethally irradiated (5 Gy) prior to
  transplantation. The congenic wild-type (DL) BM cells labeled with CM-DiI were transplanted
  via caudal vein injection into tx mice at the early (2 months of age) or late stage
  (5 months of age) of WD. The same volume of saline or tx BM cells were injected
  as controls. The DL donor cell population, copper concentration, serum ceruloplasmin
  oxidase activity and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels in the various groups
  were evaluated at 1, 4, 8 and 12 weeks post-transplant, respectively. RESULTS: The
  DL BM cells population was observed from 1 to 12 weeks and peaked by the 4th week
  in the recipient liver after transplantation. DL BM cells transplantation during
  the early stage significantly corrected copper accumulation, AST across the observed
  time points and serum ceruloplasmin oxidase activity through 8 to 12 weeks in tx
  mice compared with those treated with saline or tx BM cells (all P < 0.05). In contrast,
  BM cells transplantation during the late stage only corrected AST levels from 4
  to 12 weeks post-transplant and copper accumulation at 12 weeks post-transplant
  (all P < 0.05). No significant difference was found between the saline and tx BM
  cells transplantation groups across the observed time points (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS:
  Early stage transplantation of normal BM cells is better than late stage transplantation
  in correcting liver function and copper metabolism in a mouse model of WD.'
