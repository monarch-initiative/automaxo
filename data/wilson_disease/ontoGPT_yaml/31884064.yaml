input_text: 'Assessment of the Hallmarks of Wilson Disease in CT Scan Imaging. INTRODUCTION:
  Owing to nonspecific clinical symptoms, Wilson disease (WD) diagnosis is often missed
  or delayed; hence, many patients reach end-stage liver disease. When cirrhosis takes
  place, it is difficult to distinguish between WD and other causes of cirrhosis by
  imaging alone. This study outlines abdominal computed tomography (CT) imaging findings
  that occur more frequently in patients with WD cirrhosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS:
  Fifty-seven patients with WD who had referred for liver transplantation took part
  in this study and underwent dynamic liver CT examination before transplantation.
  Qualitative and quantitative parameters including liver density, contour irregularity,
  dysmorphia, hypertrophy of caudate lobe, presence of focal parenchymal lesion, thickness
  of perihepatic fat layer, periportal thickness, lymphadenopathy, and other associated
  findings were recorded and evaluated. RESULTS: Among these patients, 85.9% had contour
  irregularity, 28% had hepatic dysmorphia, and periportal thickening and cholelithiasis
  were found in 25.5% and 12.3% of patients, respectively. Splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy,
  and portosystemic shunting were observed in all patients. Also, hyperdense nodules
  (>20 mm) and honeycomb pattern were detected in 65.2% and 15.2% of patients, respectively,
  in the arterial phase. In the portal phase, these findings were detected only in
  13% and 4.3% of patients. Hypertrophy of caudate lobe was seen only in 12.2% of
  patients. CONCLUSION: WD-associated cirrhosis has many CT imaging findings, although
  most of them are nonspecific. Some findings, such as hyperdense nodules and honeycomb
  pattern in non-contrast-enhanced CT scan and arterial phase of triphasic CT scan
  with lack of hypertrophy of caudate lobes, are hallmarks of WD.'
