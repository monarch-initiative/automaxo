input_text: Newborn screening for lysosomal storage disorders and other neuronopathic
  conditions. Newborn screening (NBS) is a public health program aimed at identifying
  treatable conditions in presymptomatic newborns to avoid premature mortality, morbidity,
  and disabilities. Currently, every newborn in the Unites States is screened for
  at least 29 conditions where evidence suggests that early detection is possible
  and beneficial. With new or improved treatment options and development of high-throughput
  screening tests, additional conditions have been proposed for inclusion into NBS
  programs. Among those are several conditions with a strong neuronopathic component.
  Some of these conditions have already been added to a few national and international
  screening programs, whereas others are undergoing pilot studies to determine the
  test performance metrics. Here, we review the current state of NBS for 13 lysosomal
  storage disorders, X-adrenoleukodystrophy, Wilson disease, and Friedreich ataxia.
