input_text: 'Efficacy of liver transplantation for acute hepatic failure: a single-center
  experience. BACKGROUND: Acute hepatic failure (AHF) is a devastating clinical syndrome
  with a high mortality rate. The outcome of AHF varies with etiology, but liver transplantation
  (LT) can significantly improve the prognosis and survival rate of such patients.
  This study aimed to detect the role of LT and artificial liver support systems (ALSS)
  for AHF patients and to analyze the etiology and outcome of patients with this disease.
  METHODS: A retrospective analysis was made of 48 consecutive patients with AHF who
  fulfilled the Kings College Criteria for LT at our center. We analyzed and compared
  the etiology, outcome, prognosis, and survival rates of patients between the transplantation
  (LT) group and the non-transplantation (N-LT) group. RESULTS: AHF was due to viral
  hepatitis in 25 patients (52.1%; hepatitis B virus in 22), drug or toxic reactions
  in 14 (29.2%; acetaminophen in 6), Wilson disease in 4 (8.3%), unknown reasons in
  3 (6.3%), and miscellaneous conditions in 2 (4.2%). In the LT group, 36 patients
  (7 underwent living donor LT, and 29 cadaveric LT) had an average model for end-stage
  liver disease score (MELD) of 35.7. Twenty-eight patients survived with good graft
  function after a follow-up of 27.3+/-4.5 months. During the waiting time, 6 patients
  were treated with ALSS and 2 of them died during hospitalization. The 30-day, 12-month,
  and 18-month survival rates were 77.8%, 72.2%, and 66.7%, respectively. In the N-LT
  group, 12 patients had an average MELD score of 34.5. Four patients were treated
  with ALSS and all died during hospitalization. The 90-day and 1-year survival rates
  were only 16.7% and 8.3%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Hepatitis is the most prominent
  cause of AHF at our center. Most patients with AHF, who fulfill the Kings College
  Criteria for LT, did not survive longer without LT. ALSS did not improve the prognosis
  of AHF patients, but may extend the waiting time for a donor. Currently, LT is still
  the most effective way to improve the prognosis of AHF patients.'
