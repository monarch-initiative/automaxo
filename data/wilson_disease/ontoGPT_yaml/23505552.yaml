input_text: 'Novel bioimaging techniques of metals by laser ablation inductively coupled
  plasma mass spectrometry for diagnosis of fibrotic and cirrhotic liver disorders.
  BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Hereditary disorders associated with metal overload or unwanted
  toxic accumulation of heavy metals can lead to morbidity and mortality. Patients
  with hereditary hemochromatosis or Wilson disease for example may develop severe
  hepatic pathology including fibrosis, cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. While
  relevant disease genes are identified and genetic testing is applicable, liver biopsy
  in combination with metal detecting techniques such as energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
  (EDX) is still applied for accurate diagnosis of metals. Vice versa, several metals
  are needed in trace amounts for carrying out vital functions and their deficiency
  due to rapid growth, pregnancy, excessive blood loss, and insufficient nutritional
  or digestive uptake results in organic and systemic shortcomings. Established in
  situ techniques, such as EDX-ray spectroscopy, are not sensitive enough to analyze
  trace metal distribution and the quantification of metal images is difficult. METHODS:
  In this study, we developed a quantitative biometal imaging technique of human liver
  tissue by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS)
  in order to compare the distribution of selected metals in cryo-sections of healthy
  and fibrotic/cirrhotic livers. RESULTS: Most of the metals are homogeneous distributed
  within the normal tissue, while they are redirected within fibrotic livers resulting
  in significant metal deposits. Moreover, total iron and copper concentrations in
  diseased liver were found about 3-5 times higher than in normal liver samples. CONCLUSIONS:
  Biometal imaging via LA-ICP-MS is a sensitive innovative diagnostic tool that will
  impact clinical practice in identification and evaluation of hepatic metal disorders
  and to detect subtle metal variations during ongoing hepatic fibrogenesis.'
