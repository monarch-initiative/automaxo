input_text: 'Long-term follow-up of Wilson disease: natural history, treatment, mutations
  analysis and phenotypic correlation. BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Wilson disease (WD) is
  an inherited disorder of copper metabolism. When treated, the outcome can be excellent,
  although the long-term survival has yet to be well documented. The aim of this study
  was to describe the long-term outcome of a cohort of patients with WD and to assess
  those factors affecting the phenotypic manifestation of WD. METHODS: The presence
  of mutations to the ATP7B gene, the clinical manifestations, treatments and the
  long-term outcomes were analysed retrospectively in 117 patients with WD (59 men
  and 58 women, aged at evaluation 38.5 +- 11, range 16-63 years). RESULTS: Fifty-five
  patients with a neurological presentation, 51 patients with a hepatic presentation
  and 11 asymptomatic patients were followed up for an average of 15.1 +- 10 years
  (median 12 years, range 1-41 years). The H1069Q ATP7B gene mutation was the most
  frequent genetic variant (54.3%); the frequency of this mutation did not differ
  between patients with either the hepatic or the neurological presentation (P = 0.099).
  d-penicillamine or zinc salts (81 and 17% respectively) were used for treatment,
  and three patients underwent liver transplantation. The majority of symptomatic
  patients became asymptomatic, or improved, during the follow-up (82% patients with
  hepatic presentation, 69% with neurological presentation). The long-term survival
  of patients with WD did not differ from that of the general Czech population (P
  = 0.95). CONCLUSIONS: Long-term follow-up shows a satisfactory response in the great
  majority of adequately treated patients with WD and survival coincides with that
  of the general population.'
