input_text: 'Correlations between anthropometric and serologic elements of metabolic
  syndrome and histopathologic features of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. AIM OF
  THE STUDY: Studying the correlation between elements of metabolic syndrome and histological
  changes of the liver in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS:
  Thirty-nine patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease were included in our
  study. Inclusion criteria were: presence of liver steatosis on ultrasound in patients
  with waist circumference over 94 cm in men and over 80 cm in women and with serologic
  elements of metabolic syndrome. Exclusion criteria were: chronic viral hepatitis,
  autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson disease, hemochromatosis, regular alcohol consumption.
  Body mass index, waist circumference, fasting plasma glucose, serum triglyceride
  and cholesterol levels and serum ALT were determined. On liver biopsy specimens,
  performed in each patient, the NASH score, representing the sum of fibrosis, steatosis,
  lobular inflammation and ballooning, was calculated. RESULTS: Necroinflammation
  was mild in 15 patients, medium in 19 patients and severe in five patients. Mild
  fibrosis was present in four cases, medium in 14 cases, severe in six, and two patients
  were diagnosed with cirrhosis. We found statistically significant correlation between
  waist circumference and the grade of histological activity, the presence of diabetes
  and both fibrosis grade and histological activity, and the serum ALT and histological
  activity. CONCLUSIONS: Noninvasive assessment of the severity of hepatic histological
  changes in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease could be made by anthropometric parameters
  or by serologic components of metabolic syndrome, but it is not an accurate method
  to identify patients with high-risk for disease progression. These noninvasive parameters
  cannot replace liver biopsy.'
