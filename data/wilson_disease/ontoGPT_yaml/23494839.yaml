input_text: 'Plasma exchange for hemolytic crisis and acute liver failure in Wilson
  disease. Wilson disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism
  which primarily involves the liver and the central nervous system. Rarely, WD can
  present as acute liver failure (ALF) and this disease is universally fatal in the
  absence of liver transplantation. The authors report a young girl with WD ALF, who
  showed signs of recovery after prompt initiation of plasma exchange (PE) and chelation
  therapy. Though liver transplantation could not be done in this child and the child
  died 8 d after stopping PE, this case highlights that PE can be a successful medical
  treatment in WD ALF and should be considered as a therapeutic measure to stabilize
  a patient by decreasing serum copper, reducing hemolysis, and helping to prevent
  renal tubular injury from copper and copper complexes until liver transplantation
  is possible. '
