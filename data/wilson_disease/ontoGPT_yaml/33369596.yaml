input_text: "Long-Term Urinary Copper Excretion on Chelation Therapy in Children with
  Wilson Disease. OBJECTIVES: In Wilson disease (WD), 24-hour urinary copper excretion
  (UCE) is recommended to be used for diagnosis. It may be a useful tool to assess
  the efficacy of treatment during follow-up; however, there are limited data regarding
  the cutoff value of 24-hour UCE during follow-up in children. Therefore, we aim
  to evaluate the clinical use of 24-hour UCE during follow-up in children with WD.
  PATIENTS AND METHODS: Medical records of children diagnosed with WD at Kings' College
  Hospital from 2005 to 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. The UCE, serum copper,
  and ceruloplasmin levels, tested during follow-up, were statistically analyzed.
  RESULTS: Over the median duration of 7 years (range 1.4-14.4), 28 patients (age
  ranged 3.8-17.3 years) had UCE tests during follow-up. Of those, 21 patients had
  at least one 24-hour UCE test and 7 children had only spot UCE tests. In comparison
  with the level of 24-hour UCE collected at the first visit after penicillamine challenge
  test, the median excretion rate was significantly reduced over the follow-up period
  (P < 0.001), from 26.2 to 8.9 mumol/day following 1-2 years of therapy (P = 0.15),
  then reduced significantly to 2.2 mumol/day after 3-4 years (P = 0.009), and 5.6
  mumol/day at >5 years of follow-up (P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests
  that within 1 year of treatment, the level of nonceruloplasmin-bound copper concentration
  (NCC) drops to <0.8 mumol/L. In the absence of progressive liver disease or signs
  of copper deficiency, 24-hour UCE decreases to <=8 mumol/day and <6 mumol/day after
  1 and 5 years of treatment, respectively."
