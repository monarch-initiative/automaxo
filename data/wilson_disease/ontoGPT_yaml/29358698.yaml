input_text: Production of Wilson Disease Model Rabbits with Homology-Directed Precision
  Point Mutations in the ATP7B Gene Using the CRISPR/Cas9 System. CRISPR/Cas9 has
  recently been developed as an efficient genome engineering tool. The rabbit is a
  suitable animal model for studies of metabolic diseases. In this study, we generated
  ATP7B site-directed point mutation rabbits to simulate a major mutation type in
  Asians (p. Arg778Leu) with Wilson disease (WD) by using the CRISPR/Cas9 system combined
  with single-strand DNA oligonucleotides (ssODNs). The efficiency of the precision
  point mutation was 52.94% when zygotes were injected 14 hours after HCG treatment
  and was significantly higher than that of zygotes injected 19 hours after HCG treatment
  (14.29%). The rabbits carrying the allele with mutant ATP7B died at approximately
  three months of age. Additionally, the copper content in the livers of rabbits at
  the onset of WD increased nine-fold, a level similar to the five-fold increase observed
  in humans with WD. Thus, the efficiency of precision point mutations increases when
  RNAs are injected into zygotes at earlier stages, and the ATP7B mutant rabbits are
  a potential model for human WD disease with applications in pathological analysis,
  clinical treatment and gene therapy research.
