input_text: "[Living donor liver transplantation treatment of Wilson's disease complicated
  with neuropathy]. OBJECTIVE: To investigate living donor liver transplantation for
  Wilson disease with neurologic features. METHODS: From Jan 2001 to Mar 2003, fifteen
  cases of living donor liver transplantation were performed for Wilson Disease (WD),
  five of those were complicated with neurologic features. A retrospective analysis
  was given for cooper metabolism and neurologic features. RESULTS: All operation
  were living related liver transplantation and donors were mothers. Four left lobes
  with hepatic middle vein and one right lobe without hepatic middle vein were harvested
  from donors, and graft volume to recipient body weight ratio was 0.79 approximately
  1.08. One patient occurred hepatic artery thrombosis and performed retransplantation
  later, the other recipients recovered satisfactorily. All patients showed Extrapyramidal
  sign and three patients companying with language handicap and dyskinesia alleviated
  postoperation follow-up between 2 and 16 months. All recipients are alive and remain
  well, and none have developed signs of recurrent WD. CONCLUSION: Living donor liver
  transplantation is effective treatment for WD complicated with nervous system symptom,
  ceruloplasmin is normal and Kayser-Fleischer ring and nervous system symptom are
  to various extents."
