input_text: 'Preliminary study of spontaneous hepatitis in Long-Evans Cinnamon rats:
  a blood exchange may improve fetal hepatitis. Long-Evans Cinnamon rats are a Wilson
  disease model highly susceptible to fulminant hepatitis around the age of 20 weeks,
  and hepatoma over the age of one year. Although prophylaxis has been established
  for the otherwise fatal hepatitis, effective treatment remains unknown. A blood
  exchange was tested to determine whether the prognosis of spontaneous hepatitis
  could be modified in icteric female rats. When bilirubinuria appeared, the rats
  immediately underwent surgery. Rats under anesthesia were first cannulated into
  the right atrium via the carotid vein, followed by 2.5 mL of blood exchange with
  heparinized fresh blood from Long-Evans agouti rats. Treated rats and controls were
  then observed for 2 months. Compared to the 50% mortality of untreated rats, all
  icteric rats that received a blood exchange survived the acute episode. We confirmed
  that Wilson disease animals are highly susceptible to acute hepatitis and show a
  poor prognosis. However, a single blood exchange improved spontaneous hepatitis
  in this animal model. This would serve as a first step for establishing a treatment
  for fatal hepatitis in animals. A blood exchange may improve fulminant hepatitis
  of Wilson disease model rats.'
