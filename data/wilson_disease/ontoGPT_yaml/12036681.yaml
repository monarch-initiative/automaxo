input_text: 'Kayser-Fleischer ring as the presenting sign of Wilson disease. PURPOSE:
  To describe a case in which the recognition by the ophthalmologist of Kayser-Fleischer
  rings played a crucial role in the diagnosis of Wilson disease (hepatolenticular
  degeneration). DESIGN: Interventional case report. METHODS: An 18-year-old woman
  was found to have bilateral peripheral golden brown pigment deposits at the level
  of the Descemet membrane consistent with Kayser-Fleischer rings. She initially denied
  systemic symptoms. RESULTS: The serum cerumoplasmin level of the patient was normal.
  Liver function tests were also normal. Further evaluations with 24-hour urine copper
  assay and liver biopsy were positive for Wilson disease. She underwent anticopper
  therapy and, 6 months later, reported improved concentration and balance. No appreciable
  change occurred in the Kayser-Fleischer rings. CONCLUSION: Wilson disease occurs
  when a defective copper-transporting enzyme in the liver results in toxic copper
  accumulation in multiple organs. Because of the insidious nature of the disease,
  patients may not seek medical attention until severe irreversible damage has occurred.
  By diagnosis of Kayser-Fleischer rings, ophthalmologists may play a critical role
  in the early recognition and proper evaluation of such patients.'
