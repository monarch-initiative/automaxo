input_text: 'Prospective pilot study of a single daily dosage of trientine for the
  treatment of Wilson disease. BACKGROUND: Wilson disease requires lifelong therapy,
  currently given daily in multiple divided dosages. AIM: To prospectively evaluate
  once-daily trientine as therapy for Wilson disease. METHODS:  STUDY GROUP: eight
  patients (seven males) aged 22-71 years with stable Wilson disease treated from
  4 to 50 years. Patients were monitored for 3 months then for 12 months on a single
  daily dose of trientine (15 mg/kg). RESULTS: All patients remained clinically well.
  ALT and AST fluctuated in some, but none required treatment stoppages or side effects.
  Liver synthetic function was unchanged. Mean 24-h urine copper and zinc excretions
  at end of treatment were 313.4 +- 191.7 and 2,214 +- 1,346 mug, respectively. CONCLUSIONS:
  Once-daily trientine should be explored further for possible maintenance therapy
  for WD. Single daily dose may improve adherence to therapy. Larger trials and longer-term
  follow-up will establish the safety and treatment efficacy of this once-daily treatment
  regimen for WD (registration: NCT01472874).'
