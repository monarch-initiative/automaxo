input_text: "Current state of Wilson disease patients in central Japan. OBJECTIVE:
  This study evaluated the current state of patients with Wilson disease in central
  Japan. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1999 and 2007, 30 patients were diagnosed as
  having Wilson disease with an International Diagnostic Score of 4 or more. The phenotypes,
  genotypes and post-diagnostic courses of these patients were analyzed. RESULTS:
  Twenty-six patients had ATP7B mutations responsible for Wilson disease. Four patients
  had a single mutant chromosome. There were 2 major mutations of 2333 G>T and 2871
  delC (40%), and 6 novel mutations (13%) in our patients. The first clinical manifestation
  was the hepatic form in 22, neurological form in 5, and hemolysis in 3 patients.
  The hepatic form was diagnosed around the age of 13 years, followed by neurological
  complication with a time lag of 9 years. Thus, some patients, especially patients
  with the neurological form, did not undergo early diagnostic tests including ATP7B
  analysis. During the post-diagnosis period, 3 patients were hospitalized for recurrent
  liver disease, and 2 patients committed suicide. One female patient died from acute
  hepatic failure associated with encephalopathy after fertilization therapy, while
  2 male patients recovered from encephalopathy-free, prolonged hepatic failure after
  noncompliance with drug therapy. The King's Scores for liver transplantation were
  below the cut-off in both cases. CONCLUSION: To minimize delayed diagnosis, ceruloplasmin
  determination and ATP7B analysis may be recommended to patients showing hepatic
  damage of unknown etiology. At gene diagnosis, appropriate management of patients
  including compliance education and emotional care to prevent suicide might be important."
