input_text: 'MR imaging features of liver involvement by Wilson disease in adult patients.
  OBJECTIVE: To describe the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) presentation of liver
  involvement in adult patients with Wilson disease (WD) and determine the most indicative
  appearance of this condition on MRI using a retrospective case-control study. MATERIALS
  AND METHODS: MRI examinations of 23 adult patients with WD (14 men, 9 women; mean
  age = 40.4 years) were analyzed by two blinded observers and compared to those obtained
  in 23 patients with chronic viral hepatitis (14 men, 9 women, mean age = 40.4 years)
  who were matched for age, gender and severity of chronic liver disease. Images were
  qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed with respect to imaging presentation.
  Comparisons were performed using univariate analysis. RESULTS: Honeycomb pattern
  of hepatic parenchyma was the most discriminating independent variable for the diagnosis
  of WD (odds ratio, 17.082; 95 % CI 2.092-139.497) (P = 0.0081) but had a sensitivity
  of 43 % (10/23; 95 % CI 23-66 %). Regular liver contours was the other variable
  that strongly correlated with the presence of liver involvement by WD (odds ratio,
  11.939; 95 % CI 1.503-94.836) (P = 0.0190). CONCLUSION: The honeycomb pattern is
  the most discriminating independent variable for the diagnosis of liver involvement
  by WD but has limited sensitivity. Familiarity with this finding may clarify the
  cause of diffuse hepatic parenchymal abnormalities in patients with unknown WD.'
