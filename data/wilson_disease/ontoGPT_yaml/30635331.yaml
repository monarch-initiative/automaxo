input_text: 'MR Imaging of the Brain in Neurologic Wilson Disease. BACKGROUND AND
  PURPOSE: Neurologic Wilson disease is an inherited disease characterized by a copper
  metabolic disorder that causes damage to many organs, especially the brain. Few
  studies report the relationships between these neurologic symptoms and MR imaging
  of the brain. Therefore, we investigated the correlation of brain abnormalities
  in patients with neurologic Wilson disease with their clinical symptoms, age of
  onset, and lag time to diagnosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cohort of 364 patients
  was recruited in China between January 2003 and December 2017. Age of onset, lag
  time until diagnosis, and neurologic symptoms were recorded, and cranial MR imaging
  was performed. Patients were divided into groups within each of these factors for
  correlation analysis with the MR imaging brain scans. RESULTS: Abnormal signals
  in the MR imaging brain scans were seen in all 364 cases. Affected regions included
  the putamen, pons, midbrain, and thalamus, while the medulla and occipital lobe
  were unaffected. The putamen was the most frequently damaged brain region in this
  study. With the age of onset younger than 10 years, cranial MR imaging scans showed
  only impairment in the putamen. Patients with a longer lag time before diagnosis
  were more likely to have impairment in the pons, midbrain, and cortex. Among neurologic
  symptoms of Wilson disease, torsion spasm is associated with the midbrain and cortex,
  and choreoathetosis is related to the caudate nucleus. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormalities
  in the putamen, pons, midbrain, and thalamus are part of the neuroimaging spectrum
  of Wilson disease. There is a significant correlation between the site of brain
  injury and diagnosis lag time.'
