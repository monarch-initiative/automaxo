input_text: 'Efficacy and safety of oral chelators in treatment of patients with Wilson
  disease. BACKGROUND & AIMS: Wilson disease is a genetic copper storage disorder
  that causes hepatic and neurologic symptoms. Chelating agents (D-penicillamine,
  trientine) are used as first-line therapies for symptomatic patients, but there
  are few data from large cohorts. We assessed the safety of D-penicillamine and trientine
  therapy and outcomes of patients with Wilson disease. METHODS: We performed a retrospective
  analysis of data on 380 patients with Wilson disease from tertiary care centers
  in Germany and Austria, and 25 additional patients from the EUROWILSON registry.
  Chelator-based treatment regimens were analyzed for their effect on neurologic and
  hepatic symptoms and for adverse events that led to discontinuation of therapy (Kaplan-Meier
  estimation; data were collected for a mean of 13.3 y after therapy began). RESULTS:
  Changes in medication were common, resulting in analysis of 471 chelator monotherapies
  (326 patients receiving D-penicillamine and 141 receiving trientine). Nine of 326
  patients treated with D-penicillamine and 3 of 141 patients given trientine underwent
  liver transplantation. Adverse events leading to discontinuation of treatment were
  more frequent among those receiving D-penicillamine than trientine (P = .039). Forty-eight
  months after therapy, hepatic deterioration was reported in only 4 of 333 patients
  treated initially with a chelating agent. Hepatic improvements were observed in
  more than 90%, and neurologic improvements were observed in more than 55%, of therapy-naive
  patients, and values did not differ significantly between treatments. However, neurologic
  deterioration was observed less frequently in patients given D-penicillamine first
  (6 of 295) than those given trientine first (4 of 38; P = .018). CONCLUSIONS: Chelating
  agents are effective therapies for most patients with Wilson disease; D-penicillamine
  and trientine produce comparable outcomes, although D-penicillamine had a higher
  rate of adverse events. Few patients receiving chelation therapy had neurologic
  deterioration, which occurred more frequently in patients who received trientine.'
