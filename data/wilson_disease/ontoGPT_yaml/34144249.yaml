input_text: "Characteristics and outcomes of hospitalized patients with Wilson's disease
  in the United States: A national survey. INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Wilson's disease
  (WD) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by excessive copper disposition predominantly
  in the liver and brain. Hospitalization data on patients with WD are scarce. Hence,
  we sought to examine the inpatient characteristics and outcomes of patients with
  WD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We utilized the National Inpatient Database (2006-2011)
  and analyzed all adult patients with a diagnosis of WD. RESULTS: There were 9046
  hospitalizations during the study period. The leading etiologies for admissions
  were chronic liver disease (8.58%), WD (6.49%) and infections (septicemia 3.10%
  and pneumonia 2.50%). The overall inpatient mortality rate for WD patients was 2.58%.
  Independent predictors of mortality in WD patients were acute respiratory failure
  (OR: 4.53; 95% CI: 2.44-8.42), acute renal failure (OR: 4.09; 95% CI: 2.19-7.65),
  decompensated liver disease or liver failure (OR: 3.37; 95% CI: 1.72-6.59), and
  advanced age (every 10 year increase, OR: 1.48; 95% CI: 1.25-1.75). Propensity-score
  matched analysis revealed better inpatient survival in WD patients compared to matched
  non-WD patients (2.84% vs. 4.67%, p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated
  the clinical characteristics and outcomes of hospitalized patients with WD. These
  findings add important knowledge to our understanding of the healthcare utilization
  and outcomes of this rare disease in the United States."
