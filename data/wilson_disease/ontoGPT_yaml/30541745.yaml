input_text: 'FDA Approval Summary: (Daunorubicin and Cytarabine) Liposome for Injection
  for the Treatment of Adults with High-Risk Acute Myeloid Leukemia. On August 3,
  2017, the FDA granted regular approval to Vyxeos (also known as CPX-351; Jazz Pharmaceuticals),
  a liposomal formulation of daunorubicin and cytarabine in a fixed combination, for
  the treatment of adults with newly diagnosed therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia
  (t-AML) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MRC).
  Approval was based on data from Study CLTR0310-301, a randomized, multicenter, open-label,
  active-controlled trial comparing Vyxeos with a standard combination of daunorubicin
  and cytarabine ("7+3") in 309 patients 60-75 years of age with newly diagnosed t-AML
  or AML-MRC. Because of elemental copper concerns with the Vyxeos formulation, patients
  with Wilson disease were excluded from the study. Vyxeos demonstrated an improvement
  in overall survival (HR 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.52-0.90; P = 0.005) with
  an estimated median overall survival of 9.6 months compared with 5.9 months for
  the "7+3" control arm. The toxicity profile of Vyxeos was similar to that seen with
  standard "7+3" with the exception of more prolonged neutropenia and thrombocytopenia
  on the Vyxeos arm. Because the pharmacology of Vyxeos differs from that of other
  formulations of daunorubicin and cytarabine, labeling includes a warning against
  interchanging formulations during treatment. This is the first FDA-approved treatment
  specifically for patients with t-AML or AML-MRC.'
