input_text: 'Concomitant immune-related events in Wilson disease: implications for
  monitoring chelator therapy. BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Current guidelines favor the use
  of chelating agents (d-penicillamine, trientine) in first line therapy of symptomatic
  Wilson disease patients. Development of chelator induced immunological adverse events
  are a concern especially under d-penicillamine therapy. This study assessed the
  prevalence of co-existing or therapy-related immune-mediated diseases in Wilson
  disease patients, and evaluated the role of antinuclear antibodies in therapy monitoring.
  METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 235 Wilson disease patients. Medical regimens
  were classified and analyzed in relation to adverse events and antinuclear antibody
  courses. RESULTS: Coexisting immune-mediated diseases were evident in 19/235 (8.1%)
  patients, of which 13/235 (5.5%) had pre-existing autoimmune diseases. Six patients
  (2.6%) developed an autoimmune disease under therapy, all of them under long-term
  d-penicillamine treatment. Data relating to antinuclear antibody courses during
  treatment and adverse events were available for patients treated with d-penicillamine
  (n = 91), trientine (n = 58), and zinc salts (n = 58). No significant increase in
  antinuclear antibody titers in patients treated with d-penicillamine (16/91; 17.6%),
  trientine (12/58; 20.7%), and zinc (7/58; 12.1%) were found. CONCLUSION: Under long-term
  d-penicillamine therapy a minority of patients developed immune-mediated disease.
  Elevations in antinuclear antibodies were found frequently, but no correlations
  were evident between increases in antinuclear antibodies and the development of
  immune-mediated diseases or medical regimes. Thus, the value of antinuclear antibodies
  for monitoring adverse events under chelator therapy seems to be limited.'
