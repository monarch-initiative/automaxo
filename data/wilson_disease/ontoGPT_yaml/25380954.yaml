input_text: "Pregnancy in a patient with hepatic artery thrombosis after liver transplantation:
  a case report. BACKGROUND: Hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT) increases the risk of
  complications and mortality after liver transplantation. The incidence for HAT is
  increased in patients with risk factors (vascular reconstructions, coagulation disorders
  and acute rejection episodes amongst others). Early retransplantation improves the
  prognosis for patients, but owing to lack of donors, surgical and interventional
  radiologic attempts to restore the patency of hepatic artery are made. The prognosis
  for the liver and the patient can also be improved by the development of collateral
  circulation. CASE REPORT: We describe a case of a 30-year-old woman with hepatic
  failure owing to Wilson disease. Liver transplantation with the use of vascular
  conduit made of donor's iliac arteries was complicated by an early HAT. Heterozygous
  factor V Leiden mutation was confirmed in the patient. Despite surgical and radiologic
  attempts to restore patency and despite treatment with fractioned heparin and aspirin,
  the hepatic artery remained occluded. Retransplantation was not considered, even
  though the patient was planning a pregnancy. After 1 year of observation of stable
  liver function, conversion from mycophenolate mofetil to azathioprine treatment,
  the patient was given consent for a high-risk pregnancy. DISCUSSION: The course
  of pregnancy was uneventful, with normal liver function parameters, without pathological
  bleedings. The patient was treated with doses of enoxaparin adjusted for the patient's
  weight. In the 34th week, owing to increasing concentration of bile acids, the pregnancy
  ended with a cesarean section. The newborn had 10-point APGAR score."
