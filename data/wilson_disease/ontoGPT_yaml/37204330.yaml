input_text: "Factors affecting activities of daily living among patients with Wilson
  disease. Wilson disease (WD) is a congenital copper metabolism disorder with various
  manifestations and can be treated with oral medication. This study examined the
  factors related to decline in activities of daily living (ADL) in patients with
  WD as research in this area remains limited. We enrolled 308 patients with WD, including
  patients who participated in a national survey and those who sought cares at the
  Department of Pediatrics, Toho University Ohashi Medical Center, from 2016 to 2017.
  We analyzed the association between ADL decline and factors including age at diagnosis,
  period from diagnosis to survey, hepatic symptoms, neurological signs, and psychiatric
  presentation at diagnosis. The relative risks (RRs) for ADL decline were estimated
  for each factor using multivariate modified Poisson regression analysis. Overall,
  97 out of 308 (31.5%) patients experienced ADL decline. After adjusting for explanatory
  variables, regression analysis revealed that factors significantly associated with
  ADL decline were a period of >=20 years from diagnosis to survey (adjusted RR =
  2.34, 95% CI: 1.47-3.74), hepatic symptoms with splenomegaly (adjusted RR = 2.57,
  95% CI: 1.26-5.24), mild neurological signs (adjusted RR = 3.20, 95% CI: 1.96-5.23),
  and severe neurological signs (adjusted RR = 3.63, 95% CI: 2.28-5.77). Neurological
  signs, hepatic symptoms with splenomegaly, and a period of 20 years from diagnosis
  to survey are associated with ADL decline. Thus, careful assessment of patients
  for these factors is necessary, and these findings may guide future efforts to improve
  patient prognosis. Neurological signs, hepatic symptoms with splenomegaly, and a
  period of 20 years from diagnosis to survey are associated with a decline in activities
  of daily living in patients with Wilson disease. AA and NS conceived the study.
  AA, KA, and YN developed the statistical analysis plan and conducted statistical
  analyses. All authors contributed to the interpretation of the results. AA drafted
  the original manuscript. NS supervised the implementation of the study. All authors
  reviewed the manuscript draft and revised it critically for intellectual content.
  All authors approved the final version of the manuscript to be published. Norikazu
  Shimizu received an honorarium from Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. This research
  was supported by AMED under Grant Number JP20ek0109482h0001. The study protocol
  was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine, Toho University(No.
  A20054). The protocols of the study were disclosed on the institutions' websites
  or other places, such as bulletin boards, and provisions to opt-out were presented.
  Therefore, written consent was not obtained. Our manuscript has no associated data.
