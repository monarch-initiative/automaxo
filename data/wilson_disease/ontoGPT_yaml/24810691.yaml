input_text: 'Characterization of timed changes in hepatic copper concentrations, methionine
  metabolism, gene expression, and global DNA methylation in the Jackson toxic milk
  mouse model of Wilson disease. BACKGROUND: Wilson disease (WD) is characterized
  by hepatic copper accumulation with progressive liver damage to cirrhosis. This
  study aimed to characterize the toxic milk mouse from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar
  Harbor, ME, USA) (tx-j) mouse model of WD according to changes over time in hepatic
  copper concentrations, methionine metabolism, global DNA methylation, and gene expression
  from gestational day 17 (fetal) to adulthood (28 weeks). METHODS: Included liver
  histology and relevant biochemical analyses including hepatic copper quantification,
  S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) liver levels, qPCR for
  transcript levels of genes relevant to methionine metabolism and liver damage, and
  DNA dot blot for global DNA methylation. RESULTS: Hepatic copper was lower in tx-j
  fetuses but higher in weanling (three weeks) and adult tx-j mice compared to controls.
  S-adenosylhomocysteinase transcript levels were significantly lower at all time
  points, except at three weeks, correlating negatively with copper levels and with
  consequent changes in the SAM:SAH methylation ratio and global DNA methylation.
  CONCLUSION: Compared to controls, methionine metabolism including S-adenosylhomocysteinase
  gene expression is persistently different in the tx-j mice with consequent alterations
  in global DNA methylation in more advanced stages of liver disease. The inhibitory
  effect of copper accumulation on S-adenosylhomocysteinase expression is associated
  with progressively abnormal methionine metabolism and decreased methylation capacity
  and DNA global methylation.'
