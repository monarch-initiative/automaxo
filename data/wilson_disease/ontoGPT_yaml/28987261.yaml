input_text: 'Wilson Disease: Diagnosis, Treatment, and Follow-up. Consideration of
  a diagnosis of Wilson disease is still the critical factor in testing for and establishing
  disease diagnosis. In association with other clinical and biochemical tests, liver
  biopsy results and molecular genetic testing can also be used to generate a score
  for diagnosing Wilson disease. Medical therapy is effective for most patients; liver
  transplant can rescue those with acute liver failure or those with advanced liver
  disease who fail to respond to or discontinue medical therapy. Treatment monitoring
  must be done at regular intervals and includes clinical evaluation, liver tests
  and blood counts, and copper metabolic parameters.'

  Split the following piece of text into fields in the following format:

  subject_extension: <A chemical or drug mentioned in the relationship between the medical action and the symptom, for example, "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  object_extension: <An optional term describing some specific aspect of the object, e.g. "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  subject: <The medical action. For example: blood transfusion, radiation therapy, cardiac catheterization, pulse oximetry, otoscopy>
  predicate: <The relationship type between the medical action and the symptom, usually TREATS or PREVENTS.>
  object: <A sign or symptom associated with the disease and targeted by the medical action. For example, Low serum calcitriol, hypoplasia of the thymus, chronic cough, aortic stiffness, low pulse pressure>
  qualifier: <The primary disease the relationship is about, or specifically the disease the symptom is related to. For example, Beck-Fahrner syndrome, hereditary retinoblastoma, progeria, diabetes mellitus, infectious otitis media>
