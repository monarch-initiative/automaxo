input_text: Electron microscopic detection of copper in the liver of two patients
  with morbus Wilson by EELS and EDX. A 20-year-old male patient with morbus Wilson
  was liver transplanted because of terminal failure of liver function. The explanted
  liver showed a strong macronodular cirrhosis as typically seen in Wilson disease.
  There were visible granular accumulations in the hepatocytes after the rubeanic
  acid or rhodanine method for histochemical detection of copper. The electron microscopic
  studies on ultrathin sections revealed numerous electron-dense lysosomes and residual
  bodies. The elemental analysis in transmission electron microscope (TEM) with electron
  energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and in scanning electron microscope (SEM) with energy
  dispersive x-ray analysis (EDX) showed copper-specific signals of electron-dense
  accumulations inside these dark lysosomes and residual bodies. In a second case,
  Wilson disease was diagnosed after autopsy of a 31-year-old patient by liver electron
  microscopy and EELS; strong electron-dense lysosomes and residual bodies with positive
  copper signals were found inside hepatocytes. For negative control, hepatocytes
  with iron accumulation after idiopathic hemochromatosis and liver cirrhosis were
  also analyzed by EELS in TEM, which showed strong iron, but only a few or no copper
  signals. Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) in 16 liver samples of healthy and
  cirrhotic liver revealed only in both cases of Wilson disease a strong increased
  copper concentration higher than 100 microg Cu/g. The electron microscopic detection
  of copper-containing hepatocytic lysosomes is helpful for the diagnosis of early
  stages of Wilson disease in addition to the quantification of hepatic copper by
  AAS.
