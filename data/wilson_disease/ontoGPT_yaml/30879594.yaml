input_text: 'Rendezvous Technique Using Double Balloon Endoscope for Removal of Multiple
  Intrahepatic Bile Duct Stones in Hepaticojejunostomy After Living Donor Liver Transplant:
  A Case Report. Cholangitis is a major complication following transplantation. We
  report a living donor liver transplant (LDLT) patient with cholangitis due to multiple
  stones in the intrahepatic bile duct during hepaticojejunostomy anastomosis, who
  was successfully treated with the rendezvous technique using double balloon endoscope.
  A 64-year-old woman underwent LDLT with right lobe graft and hepaticojejunostomy
  for Wilson disease. There was bile leakage with biliary peritonitis, which was treated
  conservatively after transplant. Two years after surgery, she developed reiterated
  cholangitis due to stenosis of hepaticojejunostomy anastomosis and multiple stones
  in the intrahepatic bile ducts. Percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage was performed.
  The size of the drainage tube was increased, and the anastomotic area was dilated
  in a stepwise manner using a balloon catheter. The stones were crushed and lithotomy
  was performed using electronic hydraulic lithotripsy through cholangioscopy. Finally,
  lithotomy was performed for the remaining stones through endoscopic retrograde cholangiography
  with the rendezvous technique using the double balloon endoscope. Rendezvous approach
  with percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage and double balloon endoscopic retrograde
  cholangiography was an effective treatment for the multiple intrahepatic stones
  in hepaticojejunostomy following LDLT with right lobe graft.'
